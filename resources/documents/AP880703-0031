(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Though William Cushner has never felt thesweet rhythm of casting a fly rod or the glowing satisfaction oftying a fly, he has been hooked by a passion for the work of theworld's greatest fly tiers.   ``It's the artistry, the craft and the skills these menpossess,'' said Cushner, a master picture framer who also framesflies for display.   Cushner's been a fly admirer for a long time, but what got hiscollection rolling was the demise of the venerable New York Cityangling supplier Wm. Mills andamp; Son.   ``Harry Hunt (who was liquidating the company's assets) openedthe doors for me,'' Cushner recalled. ``We all knew that somewherein that place were the flies of Theodore Gordon, the father ofAmerican fly fishing. I kept buying all morning long.   ``He suggested he would like to have a set of flies (framed) forhimself. Once I agreed to that, the whole picture changed. He tookme down to the basement and showed me flies that were tied in 1870.   ``I wound up with an inventory of 100,000 flies.''   The flies are put together with bits of fur, feathers andanything else that a tier thinks might attract a fish, all tied toa small hook. Most are designed to imitate flies that trout andsalmon feed on along streams and are less than half an inch long.   Cushner shows them off with a flair so compelling that othercollectors frequently offer to share their most prized flies withhim if he will frame a set for them.   ``Joe Howell was here from the North Umpqua,'' a famed steelheadriver in southern Oregon, Cushner said.   ``He says, `Have you heard of Herb Howard?' I said, `You have aset of Herb Howard?' He said he had 38 of them. He said, `I'llsplit them down the middle with you.'''   Cushner uses a water-soluble glue _ so they can be removedwithout harm _ to mount the flies on a tiny clear plastic postwithin the frame.   ``When I first thought of it, I was sitting in the subway, andall of a sudden, I could see in my mind the man casting and the flyfloating in space,'' said Cushner, a former denizen of New York.``That got to me. So I raised it from its background, which givesit its whole dimension.''   Cushner combines flies with a painting, print, carving,photograph or some other work of art, taking special care that theyrelate to each other.   ``Given the fact that I did not fish or tie flies, I had to makethis interesting for myself,'' Cushner said.   An etching by English artist Norman Wilkinson showing a singlesalmon leaping from a river has been combined with fourfeather-wing salmon flies tied by Spanish master Belarmino Martinez.   Other fly tiers represented include Carrie G. Stevens, inventorof the gray ghost streamer; Lee Wulff, originator of the royalWulff dry fly, and C. Jim Prey, creator of the Thor steelheadpattern.   A photo of famed Pensylvania angler Jim Leisenring is mountedwith a set of 11 trout flies and the dog-eared piece of paper onwhich he stored them, complete with pencil notations about theflies.   Cushner's work has been displayed at the American Museum ofSports and the American Museum of Natural History in New York. Acollection of 230 pieces is been at the American Museum of FlyFishing in Manchester, Vt.   The Fly Fishing Museum and Cushner's workshop now occupy the topfloor of his small two-story house. Now 75, Cushner figures he hasanother 10 years to build up the collection and hopes to see thework continued by his son-in-law, who lives nearby with Cushner'sdaughter and two grandchildren.   Visitors to the museum are few, so far _ it opened in May _ andnot all of them understand what he is doing.   ``I had a man in here the other day who said he loved fishing somuch, you could put a bucket of water in front of him and he couldfish all day,'' said Cushner. ``Yet with all this around him, hewasn't interested. Fascinating.''</TEXT></DOC>
