HughesStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 02/17/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><TEXT>   You're having a bad week. And that was before the boss called you in to criticize your job performance. As the criticisms mount, the worst happens.    You cry.    Does that brand you forever as not tough enough to climb the corporate ladder? And how do most bosses handle crying employees? An informal survey of dozens of senior executives shows that most have faced a crying employee at least once and in most cases several times. The incidents, they say, are always awkward and often disruptive. But despite the rise of the supposedly more enlightened manager, many executives flounder in their response.    &quot;Where can I go hide?&quot; is what Richard Bermingham, president of Collins Foods International in Los Angeles, recalls as his first reaction to a colleague crying. &quot;Then you realize you can't,&quot; he adds. &quot;You're there and you have to say something.&quot;    Most often, that &quot;something&quot; is said to a woman. Almost all of the male and female executives interviewed say women cry more frequently than men in the office. That was also the conclusion of a 1983 study by a Minnesota researcher who found that women, in general, cried four times as frequently as men.    Little wonder, then, that one recent study suggests that with more women entering the workforce, weeping at work is increasing. &quot;A lot more crying goes on than the average office worker would suspect or be willing to admit, and a lot of closet crying is going on,&quot; says Jeanne Plas, an associate professor of psychology at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tenn. She and two colleagues recently completed a five-year study titled &quot;Tears and Weeping Among Professional Women: In Search of New Understanding.&quot;    Women, though, aren't the only ones shedding tears. The executives interviewed also gave accounts of men crying when they were fired, caught stealing or told of a family illness. Some also cry at good news, such as a bonus or promotion.    The best response when a person cries, some psychologists say, is simply to allow the person to cry or to ask them if they want to take a break. (The 1983 study in Minnesota found that the average cry lasts about six minutes.) Vanderbilt's study suggests that criers view tears as &quot;natural&quot; and try to take control by saying something like, &quot;These tears are releasing a lot of tension for me; that will help this conversation quite a bit.&quot;    Moreover, the incident probably isn't manipulative. &quot;People don't have the control (over crying) that some people think they do,&quot; says William H. Frey II, who conducted the 1983 study on crying at the Ramsey Clinic in St. Paul, Minn. &quot;Generally people cry because a situation crosses the threshold of what they can tolerate.&quot; Indeed, psychologists say that crying can be a useful signal that a management style or business decision isn't working, and that executives should at least consider the cause of the tears.    Allowing a person to cry may be particularly helpful at companies in transition, where tears are often a familiar routine. For instance, Theodore Williams, chairman and president of Bell Industries Inc., a maker of electronics and building products in Los Angeles, says crying happens at all levels of the company. &quot;We are computerizing, which means certain people's jobs change or disappear, and there's a lot of insecurity,&quot; he says.    Mr. Williams says he usually asks a crying employee to step into his office and deals with the person alone so it's less embarrassing. &quot;I give them a handkerchief. I let them relax and try to reassure them,&quot; he adds.    But the way people should respond to tears and the way they do respond to tears are usually quite different. The response clearly depends on the reason for the tears and their frequency. Crying over a family illness, for instance, is usually greeted with sympathy and quickly excused. But responses range from awkward silence to resentment when an employee cries after being criticized or being told of a job change -- or for more frivolous reasons such as car problems.    Some executives simply act as though a crying person isn't crying because they don't know what else to do. David A. Derby, president and chief executive officer of Datron Systems Inc., a Simi Valley, Calif.-based maker of communications systems, says he was firing a male executive when the man cried. &quot;I had no great way of dealing with it,&quot; he says. &quot;I felt empathy but I essentially ignored it. We went on with the discussion.&quot;    The response is also affected somewhat by the sex of the person crying. &quot;If you show tears and you're female, you bring out all the prejudices against women,&quot; says Paul Ekman, a psychology professor at the University of California, San Francisco. &quot;If you're male, people will think you're not aggressive enough. You're womanish.&quot;    No matter who is crying -- and how an executive responds -- most executives say tears and business don't mix. Maurice McAlister, president of Downey Savings andamp; Loan Association in Costa Mesa, Calif., says: &quot;If you have someone who comes in once a month and cries, then you would conclude emotionally they aren't capable of handling this position right now. . . . In business you couldn't have a supervisor that wanted to cry every week.&quot;    George Barratt, vice president and chief financial officer of Computer Sciences Corp. in El Segundo, Calif., says he was once criticizing a female manager when she started to cry. &quot;I was pointing out things that (her department) was supposed to have done, things that weren't being done right,&quot; he says.    Mr. Barratt's response was to leave the room. &quot;I just said, 'I'll talk to you later,'&quot; he recalls. &quot;You can't deal with a person who's crying. Whenever someone starts to cry, the meeting is over.&quot; He also wasn't impressed. &quot;It was a waste of time. You can't run a business with people crying, or drunk, or screaming. You can't have these aberrations in business behavior and expect to perform.&quot;    Beyond creating an awkward situation, crying can breed resentment in the workplace. That's because a crying person seems to require a sympathetic response from an observer, who may be trying to get a negative point across. The recent Vanderbilt study concludes that observers often feel a crying person is helpless &quot;like a baby&quot; and needs a response suitable for a baby: physical, nonverbal, intimate and comforting.    Naturally, that feeling would be confusing in business relationships that thrive on controlled politeness and artifice. Getting a big hug from the boss is usually out of the question. &quot;A lot of people don't wish to share their intimate and personal reactions or those of others,&quot; says Prof. Ekman of the University of California.    A crying office worker may also trigger resentment in those who don't allow themselves to cry. &quot;Men have greatly distanced themselves from their feelings and have cut off responses to feelings,&quot; says Mr. Frey in St. Paul. &quot;It's sometimes upsetting to men to see someone else cry. It evokes feelings and emotions that they don't want to deal with.&quot;    Frequent crying can be even more disruptive. A female executive at New York University says she once worked for a public-relations firm and reported to a woman who cried frequently over things like a car breaking down or a plumbing problem. &quot;Knowing that she could turn cold or start crying makes everyone skittish. You're very, very nervous, and you dread the phone ringing,&quot; says the executive.    And the frequent tears didn't win the weeping boss any respect. &quot;I thought she was nuts. She was out of control,&quot; says her former employee.    The criers, meanwhile, are often left with the fear that the incident will hurt their careers -- and sometimes those fears are justified. &quot;The common assumption is that if a woman cries in a professional situation, she is weak and not appropriate for the job or she is being manipulative and can't get what she wants in a direct way,&quot; says Kathleen Hoover-Dempsey, who also worked on the Vanderbilt study.    In fact, even the thought that a woman might cry could hurt her career, some research suggests. A recent study by Catalyst, a New York research organization, found that some male executives are reluctant to criticize women they supervise for fear that the women will cry. The study concluded that this works against women in the long run because they don't receive useful advice.    Some executives, though, claim they don't hold tears against an employee if it happens infrequently. Bram Goldsmith, chairman and chief executive officer of City National Corp., a bank holding company in Beverly Hills, Calif., says a senior level executive cried while explaining that her work hadn't received recognition at the upper echelons of the company.    &quot;I told her to calm down and I gave her a Kleenex,&quot; Mr. Goldsmith says. &quot;I told her a joke, and we kept going.&quot; He adds that he didn't consider the incident a black mark on the woman's record. &quot;She's a very fine, very skilled executive,&quot; he explains. &quot;It indicates a lot of sensitivity. There's nothing wrong with that.&quot;    (See related story: &quot;...But It's Not Quite as Bad as People Who Start to Yell&quot; -- WSJ Feb. 17, 1987) </TEXT></DOC>
