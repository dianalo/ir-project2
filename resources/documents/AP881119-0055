Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aghazadeh held secret morningtalks with other ministers of the 13-nation Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries at a luxurious hotel in Vienna.   He spoke only briefly to reporters as he entered a hotel elevatorto go to his meeting with Nigerian Oil Minister Rilwanu Lukman andother officials. Lukman also is president of the cartel. Asked ifthere were any new developments, Aghazadeh replied, ``Maybe.''   Aghazadeh and Issam Abdul Raheem al-Chalabi, the oil chief ofrival Iraq, met separately on Friday with other OPEC members to tryto break an impasse that has stalled cartel talks.   The ministers were scheduled later today to resume formaldiscussions in a joint session of two of the cartel's committees.   On Friday, Aghazadeh told reporters that Iran refuses an Iraqidemand that the two rival countries be allowed to produce an equalamount of oil under a new cartel accord. ``I always reject parity,''he said. The two nations are trying to rebuild after an eight-yearwar that ended in August.   The dispute between Iran and Iraq over oil production has stalledefforts to draw up new production ceilings that would limit therecent surge in output and give a lift to sagging oil prices.   Also taking part in the behind-the-scenes negotiations today wereOil Ministers Rilwanu Lukman of Nigeria, Julio Cesar Gil ofVenezuela, Hisham Nazer of Saudi Arabia and Ali Khalifa al-Sabah ofKuwait.   Indonesian Energy Minister Ginandjar Kartasasmita gave the talksa 50-50 chance of success.   The ministers also met for about an hour Thursday evening in ajoint session of two cartel committees, officials said.   Officials fear that failure to draw up a new accord will sendcrude prices into a tailspin if cheating continues to add millionsof barrels of oil a day to an already glutted world market.   Prices are running $4 or more below the cartel's benchmark of $18a barrel.   Analysts estimate Iraq has been producing at least 2.6 millionbarrels a day, an amount that could hit 3.7 million barrels nextyear with completion of a new pipeline through Saudi Arabia to theRed Sea. Its quota under a 1986 agreement was 1.5 million barrels aday   Saudi Arabia has widened its output to more than 6 millionbarrels a day, analysts estimate, well above its daily quota of 4.3million barrels.   Iran also is believed to have exceeded its quota of 2.4 millionbarrels.   Iraq in the past has refused to abide by the OPEC quota of 1986,saying it wanted the same level given Iran. Iran has argued againstgranting Iraq an equal share.   Iraq had said during an OPEC meeting last month in Madrid, Spain,that it would not accept a ceiling that was a barrel less thanIran's.</TEXT></DOC>
