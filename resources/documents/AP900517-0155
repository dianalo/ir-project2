The pro-Iliescu crowd, some chanting ``We Love You, Iliescu,''massed in north Bucharest. They heard their candidate pledge tokeep Romania democratic.   An estimated 30,000 anti-Iliescu demonstrators converged onUniversity Square in downtown Bucharest. It was the largest crowdyet in a demonstration that has blocked the square and thecapital's main central thoroughfare 24 hours a day since April 22.   However, a feared mass confrontation between the two groups didnot materialize.   Police quickly broke up fistfights among about a dozen peoplefrom the rival groups. One government backer was detained.   Iliescu and his National Salvation Front have dominated thegovernment since the December revolution that deposed Communistdictator Nicolae Ceausescu. They are heavily favored in Sunday'spresidential and parliamentary elections, Romania's first free pollin 53 years.   Iliescu and two challengers for the presidency _ the NationalLiberal Party's Radu Campeanu and the National Peasants Party's IonRatiu _ held the nation's first-ever televised debate betweenpresidential candidates Thursday night.   The two opposition candidates repeated their charges that theFront was responsible for violence that has plagued theircampaigns. The Peasants Party claims 60 attacks against itssupporters, including two fatal assaults.   Iliescu said it was ``inconceivable that the Front, which ledthe government charged with maintaining a peaceful campaign, wouldalso disrupt it.''   Asked about the possibility of a coalition government after theelections, Iliescu said it was ``not only possible but necessary.''   Campeanu called it ``a logical idea.''   The debate failed to generate heated exchanges between thecandidates, who repeated campaign speeches they used in previousweeks.   Addressing his supporters earlier Thursday at Aviators' Squarein north Bucharest, Iliescu pledged to ``guarantee the future ofdemocracy'' in Romania.   The stage was surrounded by scores of guards who were barelyable to keep the boisterous demonstrators from rushing the stage asthey sang, ``May Ratiu and Campeanu Die of Sorrow.''   ``In five short months, we have presented a solid record ofachievement,'' declared Premier Petre Roman, flashing the ``V''sign that has become his trademark.   The capital's anti-government protestors were joined by groupsof students from western Timisoara and other cities. Timisoara iswhere the December revolution began.   The anti-government demonstrators, who paralyzed traffic in thecapital, vowed to stay put until election day, despite a ban onpolitical rallies Friday and Saturday.   Last Saturday, Iliescu said the square should be ``cleaned out''after Thursday. But Roman said Wednesday the government had decidedto allow the demonstrators to remain to avoid a ``provocation.''   The demonstrators charge that Iliescu and the Front still harborCommunist and totalitarian tendencies. Iliescu and some othermembers of the Front once held positions in the toppled Communistregime.   The opposition backers also accuse the Front of manipulatingstate-run media to its political advantage.</TEXT></DOC>
