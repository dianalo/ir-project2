The microvoid phaseof Kevlar49 fibers, polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and pitch based carbon fiberswas probed using SAXS techniques, both before, and after, the fiberswere subjected to a plasmas etching process. The response of the fiberto the etching process was found to be dependent on both material characteristicand fiber processing techniques. The average void size, and breadth ofthe distribution was monitored by assuming a Williams-Watts type correlationfunction. This new approximation method is discussed and compared withthe more familiar Debye correlation function. This new approximationallows for quantitative assessment of the distribution of void sizes.61 refs., 12 figs., 7 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
