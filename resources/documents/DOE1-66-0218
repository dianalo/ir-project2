The overallprogram included initial stages of design-support research before the12-ton-per-day (TPD) process research unit (PRU) was built. These stagesinvolved the characterization of test-specific biomass species and thecharacteristics and limits of fluidization control. Also obtained forthe design of the adiabatic PRU was information from studies with bench-scaleequipment on the rapid rates of biomass devolatilization and on kineticsof the rate-controlling step of biomass char and steam gasification.The development program culminated with the sucessful operation of thePRU through 19 parametric-variation tests and extended steady-state process-provingtests. the program investigated the effect of gasifier temperature, pressure,biomass throughput rate, steam-to-biomass ratio, type of feedstock, feedstockmoisture, and fludized-bed height on gasification performance. A long-durationgasification test of 3 days steady-state operation was conducted withthe whole tree chips to indentify long-term effects of fluidized processconditions; to establish gasifier material and energy balances; to determinethe possible breakthrough of low concentration organic species; and toevaluate the mechanical performance of the system components. Resultsindicate that the pressurized fludizied-bed process, can achieve carbonconversions of about 95% with cold gas thermal efficiences about 75%and with low and tar production. New information was collected on theoil and tar fraction, which relate to the process operating conditionsand feedstock type. The different feedstocks studied were very similarin elemental compositions, and produced similar product gas compositions,but each has a different distribution and character of the oil and tarfractions. 11 refs., 45 figs., 18 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
