(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>In the office of the '90s, users must have easy access to data wherever theyreside.andP;  An important enabler in reaching this goal is general databasegateways linking workgroup LANs to a variety of host databases.andP;  MicroDecisionware and Microsoft have moved a step closer to providing user accessto data residing in host databases from LAN Manager LANs with a new productcalled the Database Gateway.andM;The first version of Database Gateway gives OS/2 SQL Server front-endapplications access to IBM's DB2 databases under MVS/CICS using Advancedprogram-to-Program Communications (APPC) links.andP;  The gateway is designed toaccommodate other databases besides DB2, however, and communications methodsbeyond APPC.andP;  Micro Decisionware implemented DB2 support first because mostof its customers have DB2.andP;  Eighty of the 140 sites that have MicroDecisionware's PC/SQL-link mainframe software use it to provide PC access toDB2 data.andP;  The Database Gateway builds on the PC/SQL-link.andM;Support for Oracle, IBM's SQL/DS, Teradata's DBC, and other databases willfollow later.andP;  Micro Decisionware already has PC/SQL-link servers for SQL/DS,OS/2 Extended Edition's Data Manager, Tandem Nonstop SQL, and Teradata DBC,among others.andM;Micro Decisionware's Database Gateway isn't the only way to provide access tohost databases from LAN Manager LANs or standalone PCs.andP;  Sybase, creator ofSQL Server marketed by Microsoft and Ashton-Tate, provides the basis for thissame capability through its Open Server products.andP;  The Database Gateway iscomplementary to Open Server, but more pragmatic than Sybase's product.andO;Micro Decisionware is not trying to provide larger standards governingserver-to-server interaction.andP;  Still, Micro Decisionware intends to stay instep with Sybase.andM;WHAT IS THE DATABASE GATEWAY? Database Gateway is an OS/2 application thatlinks multiple PCs with DB2 databases through PC/SQL-link on the host.andP;  Itgives applications access to DB2 and SQL Server databases through a singleprogrammatic interface, the SQL Server API.andP;  In addition, it does several SQLhousekeeping chores and translates data into IBM's Information Exchange (IXF)format for interchanges.andM;PC/SQL-link servers manage interactions between the Database Gateway and DB2,in concert with IBM's CICS and VTAM.andP;  Each PC request for DB2 data spawns anew CICS transaction.andP;  On the downlink, the server software formats data toone of 23 supported PC formats.andM;Micro Decisionware also has a single-user DOS application that provides PCaccess to DB2 (and other host DBMSS).andP;  Database Gateway is the company'smultiuser product.andP;  PC SQL-link handles both PC/SQL-link DOS clients and theclients behind its new Database Gateway in the same way.andM;Smoothing over SQL Differences.andP;  The Database Gateway provides some key SQLmapping functions, which are necessary for a meaningful exchange to takeplace between an SQL Server application and DB2.andP;  SQL Server (Sybase) and DB2are both SQL-based, but they are different in many ways.andP;  Database Gatewaydoesn't mask all of these differences, but Micro Decisionware is likely tosolve more and more of them as time goes by.andM;For example, Database Gateway maps the differences in syntax between SQLServer's Transact SQL and DB2 SQL.andP;  It places keywords that are not insidequotes in upper case for DB2, puts semicolons on the end of statements,substitutes the Transact SQL negation symbol for the DB2 SQL negation symboland vice versa, and so on.andP;  Micro Decisionware has also mapped the basicobjects defined in SQL Server's catalogue-like sysobject-to DB2.andP;  However,the Database Gateway does not paper over all of the differences between theSQL Server and DB2 catalogues.andP;  Nor does it map SQL Server's storedprocedures and triggers, which allow business procedures and responses to becaptured in the database, to DB2.andP;  DB2 doesn't recognize stored procedures ortriggers.andP;  Each of these areas holds potential for future development atMicro Decisionware.andM;The implications of the differences between SQL Server and DB2 are greatestfor application developers hoping to use both databases from within singleapplications.andP;  Writing to the SQL Server API will provide connectivity to SQLServer and the Database Gateway, but that's all.andP;  ISVs will have to writeswitched or special codes to deal with the structural differences between thetwo databases.andM;Eventually, these differences may be reduced or eliminated by the work of theSQL Access Group, which is attempting to formulate a consistent SQL API andformats and protocols specifications that will allow front-end tools andapplications to access a variety of SQL-based servers.andM;Direct Access vs.andP;  Staging.andP;  Database Gateway provides both direct andindirect access to DB2 data.andP;  Direct access allows an SQL Server applicationto issue queries directly to DB2, bypassing SQL Server.andP;  To the user, thecommands and application environment employed by this process are the same asthe issuing of queries to the local SQL Server database.andP;  In the indirectaccess method, the user can issue requests for DB2 data from within SQLServer, usually by selecting the server name of the DB2 database from a menu.andO;The Database Gateway coordinates transmittal of the request and retrieval ofhost data.andP;  The Database Gateway can also be used with SQL Server to manage alocal version of DB2 data that is created by &quot;staging&quot; production data into alocal SQL Server database.andP;  Staging improves performance and shields DB2 hostdata from corruption by PC users.andP;  A  VARIETY OF CONFIGURATIONS.andP;  TheDatabase Gateway is a flexible product, supporting a variety of client-serverarchitectures.andP;  Micro Decisionware and Microsoft are promoting four majorconfigurations.andM;Standalone.andP;  In the Standalone configuration, the Database Gateway resides onan OS/2 PC along with an SQL Server application, providing access to a remoteDB2 database.andP;  In this configuration, there is no SQL Server database.andM;LAN Gateway.andP;  In the LAN Gateway configuration, the Database Gateway providesDB2 access to a collection of OS/2 and DOS PCs in a LAN Manager-basednetwork.andM;Access Coordinator.andP;  In the Access Coordinator configuration, the DatabaseGateway is deployed as a LAN Gateway on a network that also contains an SQLServer node.andP;  SQL Server applications on DOS or OS/2 clients can accesseither DB2 via the gateway, or via the SQL Server separately or at the sametime from within a single application session.andM;Database Coordinator.andP;  In the Database Coordinator configuration, theDatabase Gateway resides on the same server as SQL Server, using SQL Serveras the basis for staging local versions of remote DB2 data.andP;  TheDCA/Microsoft Communications Server can be used to provide communicationssupport to the gateway.andM;LEVERAGING MICROSOFTS COMPONENTS.andP;  The Database Coordinator configuration isthe most elaborate of the four configurations, and it illustrates the wayMicrosoft hopes Database Gateway users will leverage their LAN Manager andOS/2 technology.andP;  Microsoft places Database Gateway in its LAN Managerline-up, alongside SQL Server and the DCA/Microsoft Communications Server.andM;The Communications Server provides a variety of communications services toLAN Manager applications on demand, including APPC, 3270 terminal emulation,and asynchronous terminal emulation.andP;  DCA is scheduled to release asingle-system subset of the product, called the Communications Workstation,in April, with the server to follow at an unspecified later date.andP;  As MicroDecisionware adds support for a greater number of communications methods toDatabase Gateway, the combination of Communications Server and the gatewaywill offer a flexible host-data gateway to users.andM;THE USER'S VIEW.andP;  In a demonstration at the announcement of the DatabaseServer, the limitations of the current gateway and front-end technology werevery apparent.andP;  Using Excel and DataBase, the demonstrator was able to gainaccess to DB2 along with local data sources.andP;  But to do so, he had to namethe database server.andP;  This isn't bad, but location-transparent access will bemuch better, when it is available.andM;Much will depend on the ability of the database vendors to agree onconventions and standards that allow their products to be used together.andO;Ever slicker front-end tools and database gateways that do more translationsand mapping will help, but not fast enough.andM;A PRAGMATIC SOLUTION.andP;  The Micro Decisionware Database Gateway by itself isan impressive product.andP;  It gives users practical capabilities today, and thecompany understands what it needs to do to improve and expand function in thefuture.andP;  As Micro Decisionware carries the product forward, it will addsupport for more communications methods besides APPC and for more databases.andO;The company also plans to support distribution functions like automatedprescheduled staging of DB2 data.andP;  Depending on how the SQL Access Group'sstandards movement progresses, at some point in the future, the DatabaseGateway will provide services across different databases from a variety ofvendors.andM;We're also impressed by what Microsoft and its partners have been able topull off in the two-plus years since OS/2 was announced.andP;  At this point,Microsoft has in its system software catalogue an impressive array of localarea networking function, as well as database interconnect and communicationsservices products.andP;  Indeed, Microsoft can be viewed today as a secondsupplier of low-end Systems Application Architecture products.andM;VITAL STATISTICS.andP;  The Database Gateway for the DB2 Developer's Toolkit isavailable immediately for $6,795.andP;  The gateway itself will be available inlate spring for a single-unit price of $2,295.andP;  A PC/SQL-link server isrequired on the mainframe.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
