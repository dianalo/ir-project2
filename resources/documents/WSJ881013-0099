Rose and Judith Valente (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> UAL BA </CO><IN> AIR ARO </IN><DATELINE> CHICAGO  </DATELINE><TEXT>   United Airlines is prepared to place a multibillion-dollar order for Boeing 757 and 737 jets in a move that would bolster and rejuvenate its aging fleet, industry sources said. The order would involve a combination of firming up previous options and adding more orders and options.    The industry sources said the UAL Corp. unit wants to turn 30 previous options for Boeing 757-200 jets into orders, and add 40 more options for the aircraft. Based on an approximate price of $45 million per aircraft, the total value of the options and orders would be about $3.15 billion for the 757 portion of the transaction. The 30 optioned aircraft, accounting for about $1.3 billion of that, were announced in May as part of a larger package.    In addition, the airline is said to be ready to place orders for 35 Boeing 737s and options for 65. Based on a price of about $30 million each, the 737s would be worth a potential total of $3 billion.    It isn't clear when United would take delivery of the planes, and many details of United's plan are unknown, including when it will announce the orders. Neither United nor Boeing would comment.    Although United is said to have an understanding with Boeing about the orders, sources say both have agreed to keep the plan quiet until United gets contract agreements from its pilots and flight attendants unions. The carrier has been negotiating since last spring with the pilots on a contract that became amendable April 1. It went back to the bargaining table with the flight attendants earlier this year after that group turned down a tentative contract.    In the negotiations with pilots, United has attempted to make aircraft orders an issue, saying it would be able to buy new planes only if it won certain contract concessions. It apparently doesn't want its pilots to know that it has plans to go ahead and buy planes, anyway.    With strong traffic and an aging fleet of planes, United wants to revitalize and increase its current fleet of 397 planes. An industry source said the airline is considering buying some used aircraft as an interim measure.    As reported earlier, United dropped an effort in September to put together an order for as many as 100 Airbus Industrie A-320 jets. The stumbling block on that $3 billion-plus deal was said to be a proposal by United to link the order to contract concessions from its pilots, who refused to go along.    Frederick C. Dubinsky, chairman of the United unit of the Air Line Pilots Association, said the airline's negotiators haven't mentioned other plane deals since the potential one with Airbus.    In May, United ordered 30 Boeing 757-200 jets and took the other 30 options, in a transaction that industry executives valued at about $2.67 billion. Boeing designed the 757 with two engines and a two-person crew cabin as an economical replacement for the aging Boeing 727.    In addition to those 757s, United already has an order for 110 737-300s. Twenty-two of those were delivered in May.    At least some of the new planes would most likely be used to replace United's large fleet of 727s, many of which were acquired in the 1960s. </TEXT></DOC>
