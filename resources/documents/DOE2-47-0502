The application of UCG in great depth causes problems anduncertainties. The major problem is the creation and maintenance of highpermeable pathways in the seam. By means of permeability-tests, calculationsand an electro analogy-model theoretical limits for the application ofreverse combustion linking are shown. 10 refs., 12 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
