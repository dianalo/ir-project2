RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court today let stand a rulingthat state officials may be sued for shutting down a day-carecenter without giving the owner a chance to respond to charges ofchild abuse and overcrowding.   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by Arizonaofficials seeking immunity from a lawsuit by a Tucson day-carecenter.   The Arizona Office of Child Protective Services investigated theChalkboard Inc. center after Tucson police received a complaint in1985 that a young girl was sexually abused by a teacher there.   The investigators said they discovered at least one othercomplaint of sexual abuse against the same teacher, learned ofseveral complaints of physical abuse of the children and foundovercrowding despite an earlier warning to Chalkboard.   The investigators also said the teacher accused of sexual abusehad been suspended, and that there was evidence the physical abusehad been halted two months earlier.   Within a week of the preliminary investigation and eight daysbefore a scheduled hearing on the charges, officials suspendedChalkboard's license to operate.   The center's owner, Karen Hoyt, sued the state officials forviolating her due-process rights by shutting down the centerwithout a hearing or a court order.   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in May refused to kill hersuit. The appeals court rejected arguments by the officials thatthey are entitled to immunity because they acted swiftly to protectthe children.   The appeals court said the officials ignored state law thatrequired due-process for the day care center in such circumstances.   ``Arizona has provided procedures ... requiring notice andhearing in the absence of a showing of actual emergency,'' theappeals court said ``In ignoring these procedures ... reasonableofficials would have known that their actions were not lawful.''   The appeals court sent the case back to a lower court forfurther proceedings that could lead to an award of monetary damagesagainst the officials.   Twenty-two states urged the justices to hear Arizona's appealand give state officials broader protection against being sued. Thestates are Alabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, Florida, Hawaii, Idaho,Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, NewHampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota,South Dakota, Utah, Vermont, Washington, and Wyoming.   The case is Brandt vs. Chalkboard, 90-270.</TEXT></DOC>
