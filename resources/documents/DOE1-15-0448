Thecore of the house is thermally separated from the greenhouse by glassfolding doors, windows and brickwork. Special building features of theseterrace houses are mentioned and so is the accompanying research projecton the acceptance of 'Green solar architecture' (planted greenhouses).In order to determine the heat balance of two of these buildings, physicaland system analysis tests were done. A measurement system controlledby microprocessors measured the following data continuously at 400 measuringpositions: Heat values, temperatures and humidity of the air in variouszones of the house, heat flow in various components, air changes, conditionsof windows, doors and fans, internal heat sources (heating, electricityconsumption) and quality of the air. The subsequent system analysis wasintended to make the solar gain of planted greenhouses clear. The inhabitantsof the houses were to be given instructions for energy-saving behaviour.(HWJ).</TEXT></DOC>
