I will never support AnnRichards. And I will never vote for Ann Richards,'' White toldreporters.   White stopped short of endorsing state Attorney General JimMattox over Ms. Richards in the April 10 Democratic runoff forgovernor, but said he would vote in that race. He declined tocriticize Mattox's tactics during the mudslinging primary.   ``I've always thought he was one of the toughest campaignersI've ever seen,'' White said, ``but what Ann Richards has donewould make Himmler blush.''   Mattox said Tuesday night that he has signed statements fromwitnesses alleging Ms. Richards has used illegal drugs.   ``Yes, I do, as a matter of fact,'' Mattox told reportersquestioning him about proof for allegations he has made regardingMs. Richards.   But Mattox refused to say who his informants are.   Mattox made the comments during a televised half-hour ``debate''that Ms. Richards declined to attend, citing a previous engagementin Austin.   Ms. Richards, a recovering alcoholic, has refused to answerdirectly the question of her alleged drug use, saying she has notused any ``mood-altering'' drugs in 10 years.   ``My response has been my message to the people out there thatif you need help you can get help,'' Ms. Richards earlier in March.   Ms. Richards did not immediately answer three messages left onan answering machine at her headquarters, and calls to Ms.Richards' press secretary and campaign manager were not immediatelyreturned.   Before the debate, she said, ``I have a big rally in Austin thatwe had planned for a very long time. The television people knewthat. We told them that I couldn't come.''   White said he wouldn't vote for Ms. Richards should she win thenomination to challenge Republican Clayton Williams.   ``If she gets the nomination it will be without my help. And Ithink if she's able to be elected, she'll have it in the samefashion,'' White said.   The former governor blasted Ms. Richards for TV commercials andspeeches in which she alleged he had profited from public serviceand helped his old law firm obtain state bond business while he wasgovernor.   ``I think I've been probably been madder from time to time, butthis one ... they pretty well ripped their britches with me,'' hesaid, saying Ms. Richard had made remarks that were ``patentlyfalse, maliciously made and she should have had better judgment.''   In the primary, Ms. Richards captured 39 percent of the vote, to37 percent for Mattox and 19 percent for White, who was governorfrom 1983 to 1987.   ``I feel very badly about any time there is hard feelings,'' Ms.Richards said at a campaign stop in Mercedes before White'scomment. ``I feel badly about any personal feelings that ever getinto a campaign. I feel sure that all of those wounds will behealed and the Democrats will be together in November.''   Her campaign spokesman, Monte Williams, did not immediatelyreturn calls seeking comment about White's remarks.   White said Ms. Richards deliberately distorted his record andran campaign advertisements that lied about him.   ``Ann Richards willfully and knowingly smeared me with falseaccusations that she knew at the time to be untrue. She didn't doit just once in the heat of an argument. She did it withinexcusable regularity in the last days of the campaign,'' he said.   He said Ms. Richards ran the dirtiest campaign he ever witnessed.   ``I know tough politics ... I have been in some rough campaignsin my career and I know how to dish it out and I know how to takeit,'' he said. ``But there is a difference between negativeadvertising and unfounded, vicious, personal attacks that areout-and-out lies.   ``I think she overstepped the bounds of decency by smearing myname in such a vicious way,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
