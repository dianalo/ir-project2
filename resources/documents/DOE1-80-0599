The studies included primaryskin and eye irritation, acute oral and dermal toxicity, skin sensitization,saturated vapor inhalation, mutagenicity screening, dominant lethal studies,avian toxicity and aquatic toxicity. The results of this testing indicatedthat Cunapsol 5 has the potential to cause severe irritation by the dermaland ocular routes. Copper naphthenate and Cunapsol 5 are of low toxicityby the oral route. Cunapsol 5 does cause death when applied to the skinof rabbits at moderate dosage levels. Recommendations provide for thewearing of protective eyewear, gloves, and coveralls by individuals involvedin presentative treatment operations and that these operations shouldbe carried out in well-ventilated areas. Due to the high degree of toxicityof copper naphthenate in one fish species, it was further recommendedthat disposal of excess preservative materials should be done in an environmentallyacceptable manner.</TEXT></DOC>
