<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-43-0679 </DOCNO><TEXT>A time-resolved optical spectrometer based on the integration of a Jarrell-Ash1/4-m spectrometer and a streak camera has been used to evaluate theBoeing Burst Mode Oscillator experiment. The system provides informationon spectral evolution on both the micropulse (10 ps) and macropulse (50-100{mu}s)time scales. We have measured the micropulse duration, a wavelength shiftwithin a micropulse and the development of a discrete second wavelengthduring a macropulse. 4 refs., 9 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
