The stock closed yesterday at$18.75 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.   -- Three insiders at Invacare Corp. bought a total of15,000 shares at $29 to $34 a share in June, Securities andExchange Commission filings show. The stock soared to arecord last Wednesday of $40.75 after the company reportednet income more than doubled from the year-earlier quarter.Yesterday, the stock closed at $40.25, up 87.5 cents, inover-the-counter trading.   -- As reported in this column in early July, seven GeneralMotors Corp. insiders trimmed their holdings in May and earlyJune by 42,852 shares valued at about $1.7 million. Most ofthose were sold by GM's former Chairman Roger Smith; two moreinsiders sold additional shares in late June.   The insiders sales were at $37 to $47 a share and camebefore the auto maker's report last week of a second-quarterloss of $785 million. GM closed yesterday in Big Boardcomposite trading at $39.875, down 50 cents.   Richmond, Va.-based Signet Banking reported per-shareearnings of 31 cents, vs. 11 cents a year earlier. Thatincrease was more than double what analysts following thecompany were expecting, according to Zack's InvestmentResearch.   W.B. Millner, Signet Banking's chief financial officer,addressing the insider sales, said: &quot;Did they have insiderinformation before the earnings were announced? The answer isemphatically no.&quot; According to Mr. Millner, &quot;A lot ofanalysts simply extrapolated from the previous quarters.We've been telling analysts we've been feeling better.&quot;   Signet's growth in nonperforming assets in the secondquarter was substantially lower than the bank had expected,he said. After an increase of $48.1 million in the firstquarter, he said, problem commercial and real estate loansstabilized, rising only $4 million in the second quarter.Also working in the bank's favor, Mr. Millner said, was itsacquisition of Madison National Bank of Washington andMadison National Bank of Virginia from the Federal DepositInsurance Corp. in May. There &quot;was less deposit run-off {atthe two institutions} than we had forecast,&quot; he said. Thestock also climbed on bank-merger rumors.   Almost all of the Signet Banking shares purchased byinsiders, 200,000 of them, were bought by director AlfredoLafita, who joined the board earlier this year and has sincespent almost $3.1 million on Signet shares, SEC filings show.He could not be reached for comment.   Elyria, Ohio-based Invacare, a manufacturer of wheelchairsand rehabilitation equipment, reported per-share earnings of50 cents in the second quarter, double the year-earlierquarter.   The largest purchase was made by director William M.Weber, who bought 8,000 shares at an average price of $29.25each on June 20, a 10% increase in his holdings. Mr. Webersaid &quot;I didn't know anything in particular&quot; about thequarter's earnings, &quot;I just like the company. Some of thethings {management} did two or three years ago, such asupgrading the quality of manufacturing, are really payingoff.&quot; There's a &quot;confident feeling.&quot;   A spokeswoman for the company said its earnings gain was&quot;a continuation of the momentum Invacare has had going for itfor the last year.&quot; It's benefiting from &quot;continued increasesin market share, the graying of America and the trend towardhome health care,&quot; she said. An attorney for Invacare added:&quot;The company does not believe the purchases were improper anddoes not believe the officers and directors purchased oninsider information.&quot;   At General Motors, a company spokesman said insiders soldshares during a technical run-up in auto stocks, whichreversed itself when investors realized that the benefits ofthe economic recovery would not be immediate. The company'ssecond-quarter loss, he said, was expected by Wall Street andwas &quot;no surprise.&quot;   GM reported that its loss equaled $1.44 a share in thelatest quarter, against net income of $900.1 million, or$1.32 a share, a year earlier.   In June, Mr. Smith's 17,000 shares sold for $711,960, or$41.88 a share. He declined to comment yesterday.</TEXT></DOC>
