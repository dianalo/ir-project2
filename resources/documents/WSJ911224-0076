Theglee turned to deep disappointment the next morning when thereport turned out to be a hoax.   Nowadays, South Koreans are more apt to fear the death ofthe aging Mr. Kim, despite the strongman's three-decade longwar of terrorism against the South.</LP><TEXT>   The new attitude reflects the fact that, for the firsttime since Korea was divided in 1945, most Southernersbelieve that unification is close at hand. And they know thatthe death of the North's absolute leader could cause chaosand force enormous financial burdens on South Korea.   The idea that reunification is near was unthinkable eventhree years ago, but the sweeping ideological reverses inEastern Europe are about to affect the last bastion of theCold War. Even South Korean President Roh Tae Woo predictsreunification could occur by the end of the decade, pushed byan epochal &quot;reconciliation agreement&quot; signed two weeks ago bySeoul and Pyongyang. &quot;South and North Korea should now marchtogether toward peace and unification,&quot; he said then.   Is reunification possible? North Korea's economy, beset byfood and fuel shortages, is in trouble. And the fact that itsallies, China and the former Soviet Union, can't offer muchhelp, may push North Korea to change. &quot;My guess is that itwill happen in the shorter run, rather than the longer run,&quot;says Daryl Plunk of the Heritage Foundation in Washington.   Of course, thoughts of reunification could be naive. Butthe process has already started with the talks between Northand South Korea. What follows are the best current theorieson Korean unity:                                                                                                          Slow and Easy                                                                                                          &quot;It will take time. That's what Korea has learned from theGerman experience,&quot; says Yeon Ha Cheong, head of a researchteam at the Korea Development Institute planning forreunification. North Korea doesn't want to be absorbed by theSouth, and South Korea doesn't want to inherit a basket-caseeconomy.   South Korean officials are dismayed to see the economicsuperpower West Germany, with 63 million people, havingtrouble digesting only 17 million people in eastern Germany.&quot;Absorption is very dangerous for us, because it impedes thegrowth of our economy,&quot; says Koo Bon Jae of the South'sNational Unification Board.   Under the best-case scenario, the North Korean leadershipsees that it has no alternative but to agree to internationalinspection of its nuclear facilities, where, Washington andSeoul contend, the North has been developing nuclear weapons.(Indeed, on Sunday, Pyongyang said it was prepared to openits nuclear projects to international inspection -- as longas there was simultaneous verification that the U.S. haspulled its nuclear weapons out of South Korea, as announced.)   With international pressure off, the way would be open fora North-South peace treaty. Then, Japan would likely resumediplomatic relations and grant North Korea $5 billion inmuch-needed aid.   Says Lee Dong Bok, a special assistant to the South KoreanPrime Minister for negotiations with the North, &quot;We arecrossing the threshold into the front gate of a new phasewhen we will see the institutionalization of peacefulcoexistence,&quot; he says. &quot;North Korea is under incrediblepressure to do something&quot; about its isolation.   Trade ties and the other measures of the reconciliationpact would then be established. &quot;Japanese companies willdominate,&quot; predicts Lim Dong Sung, president of SamsungEconomic Research Institute, a think tank. &quot;North Korea willkeep relations with South Korea very limited,&quot; with SouthKorean investment probably confined to the North's borderwith Russia and China. But as confidence builds, postal andtelephone connections would open; Koreans could visitrelatives they hadn't seen in 40 years.   Then troops could be pulled away from the demilitarizedzone, and the North could divert to industrial developmentmuch of its $5 billion annual military spending. South Koreacould then begin investing in North Korean factories, tappingthe enormous pool of low-paid manpower, a perfect match forSouth Korean industry, which must deal with labor shortagesand relatively high wages. By mid-decade, the two countriesform a European Community-style free-trade area, but with twopolitical systems. And near the end of the decade, Koreawould unify under a free-market system, but withEuropean-style social welfare.                                                                                                          The Nightmare                                                                                                          The more likely scenario, frightening as it is: Kim IlSung dies.   Upon the death of the Great Leader, who is 79 years old,his son, Kim Jong Il, takes over. For decades, the elder Kimhas been grooming his son, whom analysts in the West describeas an &quot;unstable voluptuary,&quot; a lover of rich food, prettyactresses and Western movies. &quot;Kim Il Sung is a dangerousperson. But he isn't stupid,&quot; says a top South Koreannational security analyst. &quot;His son may be both.&quot;   The consensus is that the Northern military will quicklytake him out in a coup. Many experts think North Korea wouldthen descend into chaos, with millions seeking refuge in theSouth. And that could compel South Korea, howeverreluctantly, to absorb North Korea.   The costs would be staggering. A report by KoreaDevelopment Institute, a government think tank, estimatedthey could be as high as $240 billion in less than 10 years.&quot;To cover it, the South Korean people will have to sacrificea lot,&quot; says Mr. Lim of Samsung Economic Research.   The upshot: South Korea's amazing economic growth couldstall out.                                                                                                          The Best Hope                                                                                                          Donald P. Gregg, the U.S. ambassador to South Korea and aformer Central Intelligence Agency official, has yet anotherscenario. He suggests that the military man who comes topower in the North after Kim Il Sung's death could turn outto be like former South Korean military dictator Park ChungHee. Mr. Park is credited with launching South Korea on themassive industrialization that made it one of the world'sbiggest trading nations.   If the new North Korean dictator can develop the economy,then democracy may slowly emerge, as it did in South Korea,and the two Koreas will be brought closer together, Mr. Greggsays.</TEXT></DOC>
