While he didn't elaborate, Mr. White indicated that a shutdown of U.S. auto operations would effectively curtail production in Canada anyway.    Mr. White made the comment after announcing that the CAW's board will decide Sept. 1 whether to pick a strike target or to extend its strike deadline beyond Sept. 14, the date current contracts with the Canadian units of General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. expire. The union represents 64,000 workers at the three companies' Canadian works.    Contracts between the United Auto Workers union and GM and Ford in the U.S. also expire Sept. 14. Chrysler's U.S. contract runs to 1988.    The UAW hasn't said when it plans to make its strike plans known, but the union's board is expected to discuss the subject at a meeting Aug. 31. Mr. White said he is &quot;prepared&quot; to let the UAW choose its strike target first. </TEXT></DOC>
