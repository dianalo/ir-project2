While recent studies have demonstrated that 2-dimensional echocardiographicmonitoring of left ventricular (LV) function after intravenous dipyridamolehas a sensitivity somewhat less than that of thallium perfusion imaging,none has examined the usefulness of Doppler evaluation of aortic bloodflow in this setting. One hundred patients undergoing dipyridamole-thalliumimaging for clinical indications were studied. Technically adequate Dopplerechocardiographic studies were obtained in 97 patients. LV ejection fraction,peak aortic velocity and acceleration, as well as segmental LV wall motion,were analyzed before and at peak dipyridamole effect. Thallium perfusionimages were normal in 41 and abnormal in 53 patients studied. A statisticallysignificant difference in percent change from baseline to peak dipyridamoleeffect in velocity, acceleration and ejection fraction was seen betweenthe 2 groups (26 vs -2%, 51 vs -2% and 16 vs 4%, respectively, all pless than 0.05). Comparison of 2-dimensional wall motion analysis tothallium yielded a sensitivity and specificity of 74 and 80%, respectively.In the group of patients who underwent cardiac catheterization, 2-dimensionalwall motion analysis yielded a sensitivity of 64% in the detection ofCAD. The combination of 2-dimensional and Doppler echocardiographic parametersincreased the sensitivity in the detection of CAD to 85%.</TEXT></DOC>
