(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Florida's orange harvest will plunge by 29percent this year due to damage from the Christmas weekend freeze,yielding the smallest crop in 25 years, the Department ofAgriculture estimated Thursday.   Also Thursday, Gov. Bob Martinez asked President Bush to declareseven Florida counties disaster areas, and vowed to seek thedeclaration for more counties once citrus and sugarcane salavageoperations are complete.   The USDA's monthly crop forecast _ the first since the Dec.24-26 freeze that iced fruit throughout the 700,000-acre citrusbelt _ also projected a 13 percent drop in the grapefruit crop fromearlier production estimates.   The report is the first official estimate of damage to thecitrus crop, worth $1.4 billion last season.   ``This is the lowest estimated production since 1964-65,'' saidRobert R. Terry, a USDA official who specializes in Florida citrus.   Some industry officials have estimated losses at farm level atbetween $100 million and $200 million. Loss of added value fromharvesting and processing are expected to be at least another $150million.   But the full extent of the financial damage cannot be calculatedfor months, until a full assessment is made of damage to trees.   USDA analysts predicted 92 million 90-pound boxes of orangeswould be harvested during the 1989-90 crop year. This compares withthe 130 million boxes of oranges forecast in early December for thecurrent season. The orange harvest in the 1988-89 season was 146million boxes.   The analysts are projecting a Florida grapefruit crop of 38million boxes for this year, compared with the pre-freeze forecastof 44 million boxes. The 1988-89 grapefruit harvest was almost 55million boxes.   The USDA also estimated that Florida processors would pack 1.30gallons of frozen concentrated orange juice from each box oforanges, a drop in the pre-freeze estimate of a 1.48-gallon juice``yield.''   ``It's a pretty substantial overall loss, almost equalpercentage wise to the 1983-84 season,'' said Terry.   He said the December freeze ``could be considered one of theworst freezes of the century.''   Successive crop forecasts in the coming months are expected tobe even lower as possible damage to trees is assessed. The finalverdict on crop losses and tree damage will probably not be knownuntil the end of the harvesting season, industry officials said.   ``The juice will be just as good, but we're expecting a wholelot less of it,'' said John Smoak, president of Smoak Groves inLake Placid. ``We were just getting back on our feet since the lasttwo freezes.''   Temperatures dropped and stayed in the mid-teens and low 20sacross the citrus belt during the two-day freeze last month. Whenice forms in oranges, tiny cells burst and the juice dissipates. Asthe weather warms again, the fruit begins to dry up.   Much of the fruit can be salvaged and processed into juice, andprocessing plants are operating around-the-clock as harvesters rushto get as much of the fruit off the trees as possible before itspoils.   Don Farmer, assistant executive director of the FloridaDepartment of Citrus, expressed concern about the Valencia crop, aprized variety which is not ripe enough to be harvested but isexpected to show heavy damage from the freeze.   ``There was obvious damage to this crop,'' said Farmer, whogrows Valencias. ``Some of those won't be picked at all. They're onthe ground.''</TEXT></DOC>
