Schlesinger   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>09/28/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE B6B</SO><CO>   JAPAN J.MHI</CO><IN>AEROSPACE (ARO)</IN><LP>   TOKYO -- Japan's space program, like its U.S. counterpart,is struggling with a series of embarrassing setbacks.   The National Space Development Agency said Thursday thatthe engine for its H-2 rocket, the centerpiece of Japan'sspace effort for the 1990s, caught fire Wednesday duringtests at the Tanegashima Space Center off the southern tip ofJapan. It was the fourth test fire in the past year.</LP><TEXT>   A spokesman said the agency was discussing whether todelay yet again the first voyage of the H-2, which is slatedfor early 1993. That date was set last year after previousglitches forced a one-year lapse from the original targetdate of early 1992. The rocket is also already running 10%over its original 200 billion yen ($1.46 billion) budget.   Japan's space program lags years behind those of otherindustrialized nations, and the H-2 is its first 100%domestically made rocket. The H-2 is also supposed to launcha variety of other Japanese space projects, such assatellites and an unmanned space shuttle.   Delays in the H-2 could force the embarrassing choice ofeither pushing those projects back further or seeking foreignassistance. Analysts have said Japan is also hoping the H-2ultimately will compete with organizations like Europe'sArianespace for commercial launches.   Japanese engine makers, led by Mitsubishi Heavy IndustriesLtd., are struggling in part because this is their firstattempt to build an engine for the first stage of a rocket,which is the heaviest phase and carries the most fuel.   This is also their first cryogenic engine, a complextechnology that runs on liquid hydrogen. It has more powerfor its size and runs at higher temperatures than traditionalengines fueled by petroleum.   The previous major test problems were the result ofdifficulties with the turbine blade, which cracked, or withthe starting mechanism, the spokesman said. He added thatthose problems had been solved.   But the fire this week, which started in the engine'sturbo pump, apparently had a different cause, the spokesmansaid, and the agency is conducting tests.   Last Saturday, the engine had its most successful test sofar, running for 200 seconds. The space agency was aiming for350 seconds on Wednesday. But 16 seconds after ignition, thefire started, damaging the engine and the test facilitybefore it was put out more than 15 minutes later.</TEXT></DOC>
