Newsources of supply will be needed to offset the decline. Production fromconventional oil sources will not be able to keep up with the decline.Heavy oil is not a significant factor in the long term. Proven frontierreserves will only be able to meet Canada's total supply needs for threeyears. Oil sands contain the only reserves capable of meeting Canada'slong term needs. Requirements for developing them are quite differentthan they are for conventional oil: there is a significant role for government,and projects tend to be quite large and capital intensive with long leadtimes. A long term energy policy is needed that favours orderly developmentof Canada's competitive assets. Such a policy is needed to offset influencesof the international market. Canada will need production from all domesticsources if it is to maintain long term self sufficiency in oil supply.Conventional oil production should be encouraged as long as it is competitive.Oil sands are also competitive for meeting Canada's long term needs andshould be developed on a continuing basis. 12 refs., 6 figs., 11 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
