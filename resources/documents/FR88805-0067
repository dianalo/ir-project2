Applications for authorityto provide new gas service out of the Mobile Bay area filed in responseto this notice will be identified by future docket numbers assigned atthe time of filing.<ITAG tagnum="44">August 1, 1988.</ITAG>The Commission has received several applications to construct and operatepipeline facilities to move gas out of the Mobile Bay area. These applicationspropose construction and operation of major new pipeline facilities andthe transportation of large quantities of natural gas out of the MobileBay area. Applications have been filed by Citrus Interstate Pipeline Companyin Docket No. CP87-415-000, Sunshine Natural Gas System in Docket No. CP87-513-000,Gateway Pipeline Company in Docket No. CP88-393-000, and Tennessee GasPipeline Company in Docket No. CP88-437-000. All these facilities wouldbegin and end onshore, downstream of processing plants to be installedby others. Proven and probable dry gas reserves for the Mobile Bay area are estimatedto be approximately 5.4 Tcf. Presently, the only pertinent pipeline inthe offshore area that can bring gas onshore was constructed by Mobil OilCompany (Mobil) to carry Mobil's gas from its Mobile Bay production areato the Mobil Oil Exploration and Producing Southeast, Inc. (MOEPSI), processingplant, which is in Mobile County, Alabama. This plant currently has a capacityof approximately 80 MMcfd. Each pipeline proposed in these applicationswould interconnect with the MOEPSI processing plant and/or one of two plannedprocessing plants. Our primary concern here is to establish a means to process the applicationsfor pipeline construction in the Mobile Bay area in an orderly manner suchthat we can assure the present applicants listed above, as well as anyother pertinent applicants who file timely, complete applications, thatcertification for their proposed projects will issue, no later than theend of 1990 if the proposals are found to be in the public convenienceand necessity. Accordingly, we announced today that the deadline for thefiling of applications to construct and operate pipeline facilities fortransportation of natural gas out of the Mobile Bay area, where certificationfor such construction is necessary or desirable no later than the end ofcalendar year 1990, is December 30, 1988. The Mobile Bay area referredto herein is defined by a line starting at a point located at the Mississippi/Louisianastate line, at the coast, extending in a southeasterly direction to a point88anddegrees;00andmin172; W longitude and 29anddegrees;20andmin172; N latitudeand extending in an easterly direction to a point 87anddegrees;00andmin172;W longitude and 29anddegrees;20andmin172; N latitude and extending north alongthe 87anddegrees;00andmin172; W longitude to the coast of Florida. Each application presently on file, as well as each new application andamendment thereto which is pertinent to this notice, must be filed and<T3>complete </T3>between now and December 30, 1988, if the certificationprocess is reasonably expected to be completed during 1989-90, and no laterthan the end of 1990. Each application or amendment thereto on file atthe Commission as of the stated deadline which is <T3>complete, </T3>in compliance with the Commission's regulations, andripe for decision will be processed and a certificate issued, if at all,no later than the end of 1990 if the proposal is found to be in the publicconvenience and necessity.\2\<NOTE/> Applications that are filed or amended after December 30,1988, will be considered applications for post-1990 certification. Thisnotice is not intended to inhibit or discourage applications for certificationof pipeline construction where any certification is not required beforethe end of 1990.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Following <T3>Ashbacker Radio Corporation v. F.C.C., </T3>326 U.S. 327 (1945), theCommission will establish a comparative evidentiary hearing in the eventthat it has before it at one time two or more mutually exclusive applicationsin which issues of material fact are in dispute. It must be emphasized that all applications must fully comply with therequirements for applications as set forth in the Commission's regulations,including a <T3>complete </T3>and fully supported set of exhibits, as required under18 CFR 157.6, for certification no later than the end of 1990. Personswho need to supplement or amend previously filed pertinent applicationsmust do so not later than December 30, 1988, in order to comply with theserequirements. The Commission intends to act efficiently and expeditiously in decidingwhether the need for new facilities exists and, if so, what new facilitiesshould be certificated to meet such needs. Consequently, the proceduresoutlined in this notice provide an efficient, rational and legal procedureto ensure that any needed pipeline construction where certification isrequired in 1989-90 for transportation of Mobile Bay area natural gas canbe considered in a timely way. <ITAG tagnum="84">Administrative Procedures</ITAG>Pursuant to Rule 713(a)(2)(v) of our Rules of Practice and Procedure [18CFR 385.713(a)(2)(v)], this notice is designated as a final decision ofthe Commission for the purpose of receiving requests for rehearing filedpursuant to section 19(a) of the Natural Gas Act.<ITAG tagnum="21">By direction of the Commission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Lois D.
