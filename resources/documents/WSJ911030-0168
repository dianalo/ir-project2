Sweeping auto layoffs in the 1980s inspired a host ofpop-culture elegies, from rocker Bruce Springsteen's &quot;Seeds&quot;to documentary filmmaker Michael Moore's &quot;Roger and Me.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   But few tears are being shed today as Gov. John Englertries to reverse a 40-year tradition of activist governmentwhose excesses included two separate economic-developmentoffices in Brussels (now combined), a welfare program thatserved 83,000 &quot;able-bodied&quot; single people (now cut off), anda youth job corps (now defunct) whose middle-classbeneficiaries included a college student who later becameGov. Engler's press secretary.   Those efforts to wipe out Michigan's deficit are moreunusual than they may seem. So far, most states have beenpatching up shattered budgets through a combination of taxincreases and spending cuts. But Michigan is nearly alone inattempting a more radical solution: avoiding tax increasesand trying to balance its budget entirely through spendingcuts. Even with the cutbacks, however, Michigan's spending inthe current fiscal year is slated to rise 4% from fiscal 1991to $20.11 billion.   Like most state governments, Michigan's lived high duringmuch of the 1980s. After the 1981-82 recession hit, Michigandid what states usually do in bad times: It raised taxes.Later, as the economy improved, revenues of the state and ofthe 39 others that had done the same caused the nation'scombined state revenues to rise faster than the federalgovernment's did.   And the newly flush states spent the tax revenues as fastas they came in, setting aside only small &quot;rainy day&quot;reserves. In part, the states simply displaced anincreasingly stingy federal government as the source of fundsfor existing programs, especially at the county and citylevel. But states also found new ways to spend money in aslew of areas ranging from prisons and health care to lessurgent needs such as economic development commissions, stateoffice buildings and museums.   Then came the latest recession, which has slowed taxreceipts and put the states in the red. According to a reportreleased yesterday by the National Governors' Association, 31states this year raised taxes a combined total of $15 billion-- a record state tax increase (the previous high was lastyear's $10.3 billion). As a percentage of the previous year'stax collections, current state tax increases represent thelargest rise -- 5% -- since 1971. The bulk of these increasesoccurred in California ($6 billion), Pennsylvania ($3billion), Texas ($1 billion) and Connecticut ($1 billion).   Meanwhile, states have also cut back on spending, or atleast trimmed its growth. According to the new report, stateslast year cut $7.5 billion from enacted budgets.   &quot;It's a very bouncy process,&quot; says Richard P. Nathan,director of the Rockefeller Institute of Government inAlbany. In flush times, activist state government has &quot;a kindof ebullience&quot; that can lead to innovation -- or waste. Butwhen state governments cut budgets, he says, &quot;you don't makesubtle adjustments. Cutting is usually done with asledgehammer.&quot;   Making things worse, the states are being forced toaccommodate growing, federally imposed spending requirementson such programs as Medicaid, which during the past fiveyears has grown as a share of state budgets to nearly 14%from 10%. &quot;The crisis isn't over,&quot; warns Ronald Snell, ananalyst at the National Conference of State Legislatures.Raymond Schappach, executive director of the NationalGovernors' Association, expects that budget cutbacks infiscal 1992 &quot;may well equal what we saw in fiscal '91.&quot;   With taxpayers losing patience with state spending, morestates are likely to follow Michigan's strategy ofconcentrating on reducing outlays. &quot;People will accept thesetypes of cuts as opposed to raising taxes,&quot; Mr. Schappachsays. &quot;Altruism goes out the window real quickly when yourstandard of living is falling.&quot;   The force behind this change in Michigan is Gov. Engler, aformer Republican leader of the state senate who spent the1980s waging partisan warfare against the high-tax,big-spending ways of then-Gov. Jim Blanchard, a Democrat. ToMr. Engler, Michigan's state government was &quot;an attempt to beeverything to everyone. And that simply was unaffordable.&quot;   To a surprising degree, Michigan's Democratic legislators,who control the state house but not the state senate, haveagreed to go along with Gov. Engler. But not surprisingly,many quarrel with his priorities, and last year they blockedhis proposed 20% property-tax cut. (An initiative on thematter will come before voters next year, along with acompeting Democratic proposal that matches lower propertytaxes with elimination of a capital-expenditures taxdeduction for businesses.)   Nonetheless, Michigan is clearly entering a new era.&quot;There's going to be less government,&quot; Democratic HouseSpeaker Lewis Dodak says with a resigned air.   For four decades prior to Gov. Engler's upset 1990 victoryover Mr. Blanchard, Michigan had a succession of Democraticand moderate-Republican governors who regarded stategovernment in much the same way Detroit once regardedautomobiles: the bigger the better. Drawing on its enormoustax base, Michigan did much that merits praise. It nurtured auniversity system, including the University of Michigan inAnn Arbor and Michigan State University in East Lansing,second only to California's. It created a welfare system moregenerous to the truly needy than that in any of its GreatLakes neighbors. Recently, under Gov. Blanchard, italleviated overcrowding of state prisons through an ambitiousconstruction program.   Along with the achievements, however, came monumentalexcesses. While disabled widows have received comparativelygenerous medical benefits from the state, so too have itspolitically powerful state employees, who are among thebest-paid in the nation. The state has also spent heavily onpolitically well-connected arts organizations such as theDetroit Symphony. And in quest of &quot;economic development,&quot;Michigan has maintained offices not only in Brussels but alsoin Toronto, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Lagos, Nigeria.   When Gov. Engler assumed office last January, Michiganfaced a state budget deficit of nearly $1 billion. Theshortfall was smaller than those in California orConnecticut, whose governors have closed deficits through acombination of spending cuts and tax increases.   Under Gov. Engler, layoffs have shrunk the state workforce by about a thousand people, or a little less than 2%,with more layoffs planned for the current fiscal year endingnext Sept. 30. Among the hardest hit is the state's commercedepartment. Director Arthur Ellis cheerfully notes that helost 100 employees this year, or 5% of his work force. Thedepartment was the locus of Gov. Blanchard's efforts to lurenew businesses to Michigan, but Mr. Ellis says &quot;they didn't,over time, do very much,&quot; and even supporters concede thebenefits are hard to quantify.   In addition, the commerce department will no longer put upits customary hospitality tents at the Detroit Grand Prix andat the Port Huron to Mackinac Yacht Race, or provide prizemoney for walleye fishing tournaments in Saginaw Bay. And Mr.Ellis has pulled the plug on an in-house communications groupthat produced a glossy coffee-table book, distributed free bythe state, commemorating Michigan's sesquicentennial in 1987.&quot;Have one,&quot; says Mr. Ellis, waving a shrink-wrapped copy.&quot;There are a few left.&quot;   Social services, too, face substantial cuts, especially astate-funded welfare program that supplements federal Aid toFamilies With Dependent Children. Although the state willcontinue payments to the disabled and families, the majorityof the program's 110,000 recipients -- single, &quot;able-bodied,&quot;mostly male and generally ineligible for federal welfarebenefits -- were taken off the rolls this month.   Gov. Engler justifies the cut by pointing out that moststates don't have &quot;general assistance&quot; programs at all(though he neglects to add that in most states, unlikeMichigan, some sort of welfare supplement is provided at thecounty level). Rather than perpetuate welfare dependency, Mr.Engler argues, the state should help poor people find work.&quot;If the debate is over the level of welfare benefit inMichigan,&quot; he says, &quot;we've already lost the war.&quot;   Foster care is yet another area where the state hopes toeliminate waste. Its social-services director, Gerald Miller,says his department is expanding a &quot;home builders&quot; programbegun under Gov. Blanchard that sends teams of social workersto troubled families at risk of losing their children.Previously, Mr. Miller says, there was a tendency just to&quot;pull the kid out -- get him out of the home.&quot; At the sametime, fees provided to foster parents will be restructured topay more for foster children whose problems are greatest andless for those who require less attention.   But the state's sweeping social-service cuts show how hardit is to reduce spending without hurting vulnerable people.   Able-bodied welfare recipients are no longer costing thestate money, but neither are they getting significant jobtraining from the state; such programs, after all, costmoney. And many question the wisdom of undertaking welfarereform during a recession, when jobs are scarce. &quot;Nobodytries to take these problems on when revenues are more flush,when it's actually more sensible,&quot; complains Paul Conn, aformer Democratic legislative aide.   Even Engler administration officials concede that somebudget cuts do more than cut waste. Cuts in funding for thestate-federal Supplemental Security Income program, whichserves low-income elderly and handicapped people, aren'tintended to alter anybody's behavior; they're just to savemoney. &quot;Am I comfortable with cutting SSI?&quot; asks Mr. Miller,the social-services chief. &quot;No.&quot;   Meanwhile, some seemingly wasteful expenditures haveescaped Gov. Engler's budget ax. For example, stateemployees, unlike welfare recipients, have suffered noreduction in pay or medical benefits. And the employees don'thave to get a second surgeon's opinion to make sure a costlyoperation is necessary. The poor do.   Few Michiganders dispute Gov. Engler's contention thatstronger focus on education can help solve many otherproblems. But even some educators question his decision tospare not only elementary and secondary schools but alsostate universities from cutbacks. &quot;Is it smart to increasesupport to public universities and eliminate support for jobtraining programs?&quot; asks Ronald Fisher, an economist atMichigan State University. Gov. Engler, clearly irked, saysany professor wanting to save the state money &quot;should make acontribution by resigning.&quot;   In addition, Gov. Engler backed off from his initial planto cut $8.5 million in state funding for the arts afterhearing complaints from several wealthy arts patrons --including prominent Republicans such as Randy Agley, chairmanof Talon Inc., and Richard Manoogian, chairman of MascoIndustries, both of whom had contributed to Mr. Engler'scampaign. The arts cut was ultimately trimmed down to $3million. Meanwhile, no attempt at all was made this year tocut an additional $26 million in direct grants to such artsinstitutions as the Detroit Symphony and the new MichiganLibrary and Museum (though overall funding for suchinstitutions had been reduced by both Gov. Blanchard and Gov.Engler in the previous fiscal year).   The museum, a lavish sandstone structure near the statecapitol, is a striking symbol of Michigan's bygone era of bigspending -- and of the political difficulty in bringing suchspending under control. Built at a cost of $44 million tohold state archives, the post-modern edifice also houseslavish exhibits on Michigan history, including a recreationof a lumber baron's mansion that's authentic right down toarch latticework, post rosettes and stained-glass windows.But Engler administration officials are loath to criticizethe outlay; then-Sen. Engler was instrumental in getting thelibrary built.</TEXT></DOC>
