wouldn't apply to the same printer.andP;  That beganchanging two years ago.andP;  And, a little over one year ago, there were enoughsuch affordable and high-quality printers that PC Magazine covered them in aseparate section of the 1989 printer issue (see &quot;Color Page Printers:Affordable At Last,&quot; November 14, 1989).andM;Included in that 1989 overview were five printers from fourmanufacturers--the Howtek Pixelmaster, the OMS ColorScript Model 10 and Model30, the Seiko Instruments CH-5504-PS, and the Tektronix Phaser CP.andP;  All fiveprinters offered vibrant colors, with prices ranging from $8,245 to $15,995.andO;And if the prices were high compared to a typical laser printer, they werealso low enough to be affordable for medium-duty business presentation needs.andM;To make it into this roundup, printers had to be PC-compatible, print incolor, use PostScript, and, of course, arrive in time for our deadline and inworking condition.andP;  Four color thermal printers met these criteria--the NECColormate PS, the OceColor, the QMS ColorScript 100 Model 10, and theTektronix Phaser PX.andP;  As a possible high-end alternative, we also reviwed theCanon Laser Copier 500 (see the sidebar &quot;The Canon Laser Copies 500: First ofIts Kind&quot;), a $49,500, 602-pound monster capable of copying color images withlaser quality and upgradable (after a $30,000 dip into your wallet) to a truecolor laser printer.andM;Machines that didn't arrive in time were CalComp's announced ColorMaster Plusand the Linotype Color Printer.andM;STILL LOWER PRICESandM;If you take the four printers reviewed here together, they establish a cleartrend.andP;  Prices range roughly between $8,000 and $10,000.andP;  Include the SeikoColorPoint PS 4, which we review in a pre-production version (see the sidebar&quot;The Seiko ColorPoint PS 4: Still in The Wings,&quot; for more information), andthe lowest price falls to around $7,000.andP;  All five printers use color thermaltransfer technology, as did most of the color printers in the 1989 printerissue.andM;Part of the reason for the lower prices in this roundup is that the fiveprinters are all limited to paper widths of roughly 8.5 inches, with somevariation to A4, A, and Super A sizes.andP;  The high-end price of $15,995 in the1989 printer issue was for the QMS ColorScript Model 30, which handles 11- by17-inch, B-size paper.andM;Even so, much of the price difference is advantageous.andP;  For example, QMS'sModel 10, which we reviewed both in 1989 (when it won an Editors' Choice) andagain in this roundup, was essentially the same price in both reviews.andP;  Butin 1989, this PostScript printer provided an HPGL emulation only as anoption, and had only 4MB RAM standard at $9,995.andP;  In this roundup, the testedunit's $9,990 price includes the HPGL emulation and 8MB RAM.andP;  What's more,the 8MB configuration is an upgrade.andP;  The base price of the printer, withHPGL and with 5MB RAM, is $8,995.andM;Interestingly, the QMS Model 30 is still selling for $15,995.andP;  However, a newversion--the Model 30i--was recently announced along with the new Model 10prices, at a list price of $12,995.andP;  According to QMS, the only changes inthe Model 30i are that it has an internal controller rather than the externalcontroller of the Model 30, and it offers a hard disk as an option ratherthan including it standard.andM;One other price difference worth noting is between last year's $8,245 Seikoprinter and this year's $6,999 Seiko, both of which use the same engine.andP;  Notonly is this year's version about $1,250 less expensive, but it includesPostScript-compatibility in firmware, rather than providing it in a softwarepackage.andP;  (And owners of the older CH-5504-PS can upgrade to the newerColorPoint PS 4 by buying the new controller and installing it in theprinter.)andM;As a group, the current crop of printers offers more value for less money.andO;As further economies of scale come into play, you can expect this downwardprice trend to continue.andM;EMERGING STANDARDSandM;In addition to lower prices, the five thermal transfer printers show severalother trends.andP;  To start, color PostScript is now the undoubted standard forhigh-quality color page printers.andP;  In our 1989 overview, all five printersoffered some form of a PostScript interpreter, but in two cases--the SeikoCH-5504-PS and the Howtek Pixelmaster--the interpreter was a software utilitythat translated PostScript into the printer's native command set.andM;In this roundup, every thermal transfer printer includes some form ofbuilt-in PostScript.andP;  Three printers--from QMS, NEC, and Oce Graphics--useAdobe PostScript, Tektronix uses its own version of PostScript, and Seikouses Phoenix-Page.andM;Another clearly established standard is Pantone simulation, primarily ofinterest to graphic artists.andP;  Pantone Inc., of Carlstadt, New Jersey, and arecognized giant in the color-graphics-rendering arena, created the PantoneMatching System (a rigidly defined set of 736 colors) in 1963 to overcomecolor fidelity problems in conventional color graphics printing.andP;  Because ofthe limitations of the four-color printing process used by the printersreviewed here, none of them can exactly match Pantone's system.andP;  And,although all of them do offer Pantone-licensed simulations, each of thesevaries slightly from printer to printer.andM;All five thermal transfer printers offer 300-dpi resolution.andP;  And even thoughthey use different inks and different print engines, their output shows farmore similarity as a group than it shows differences from one printer toanother.andP;  As the individual reviews show, each printer we looked at producesvibrant colors.andM;Which printer produces the best color?andP;  As color researchers point out, it'sa truism that color preference is a highly individual issue, based onpersonal biases.andP;  Significantly, when we compared the output from theseprinters, we discovered that different people chose different print samplesas providing the best-looking colors.andP;  The differences are objectively real,but the issue of best and worst is a matter of taste.andM;In addition to the graphics standards of PostScript and Pantone simulation,these five thermal transfer printers also suggest that standards are emergingin connection and storage options.andP;  All five printers offer a parallel port,serial port, an AppleTalk port, and a SCSI port to let you attach an externalhard disk for storing additional fonts.andP;  The Seiko printer also includes asecond SCSI port for connection to a computer.andM;A GROWTH CURVEandM;One other trend well worth noting is that the color printer market is bothgrowing and shifting.andP;  One measure of that growth is the new players gettinginto the game.andP;  The NEC Colormate PS, for example, is NEC's firsthigh-quality color printer.andM;More interesting is the way the market is segmented and how the importance ofthese segments is changing.andP;  BIS CAP International projects separate growthfigures for each of three markets: engineering and scientific, graphicsartist, and office.andP;  The last category will generally translate to desktoppublishing and business presentation applications.andM;The engineering and scientific market is the most mature and shows the leastgrowth (15,300 printers shipped in 1989, 17,300 expected in 1990, and 20,300expected in 1993).andP;  The two other areas have been minor segments untilrecently.andP;  The graphic arts market is still relatively small but growingrapidly (2,500 shipped in 1989, 4,200 expected to ship in 1990, and 8,000 in1993).andP;  The office market is far larger and growing faster than either of theother segments (9,400 shipped in 1989, 13,900 expected to have shipped in1990, and most significantly, 22,400 by 1993).andM;So, by BIS CAP International's projections, business buyers of colorPostScript printers will outstrip engineering and scientif purchasers andalmost triple graphics acquisitions by 1993.andM;Color printers are shifting from being a niche product to being a mainstreambusiness tool--for desktop publishing and for high-quality colorpresentations.andP;  Not surprisingly, printer manufacturers are shifting theirfocus as well--to issues that are most important to the business user.andP;  Oneof the more interesting of these, though it's not addressed in the currentcrop of printers, is matching colors between monitor and printer.andP;  Ashigh-quality color printers move increasingly into the office, color matchingwill become more important.andM;COLOR MATCHINGandM;The idea behind color matching is simple enough: extend the concept ofWYSIWYG to color as well as the shape and formatting of a page.andP;  But as DavidTait, Product Marketing Manager at Tektronix, points out, color matching isonly important for a certain class of users.andP;  Tait suggests that mostengineering and scientific users, as well as some business users, aresatisfied simply to have clearly distinguishable colors on both screen andprintout.andP;  Graphic artists, in contrast, care very much about getting precisecolors, but they already know how to make the translations between what theysee and what they expect to get.andM;Tait says, and most observers agree, that even graphics artists wouldappreciate WYSIWYG colors as a way to avoid unpleasant surprises for clients.andO;But the lack of color matching is a problem primarily for the business user,who is typically unsophisticated in the art and physics of color.andM;Unfortunately, there are some fundamental technical problems involved incolormatching.andP;  For example, we perceive colors different depending on thebackground.andP;  So even if a screen color and printed color match exactly, theywill still appear different, since the white background on the screen won'tmatch the white background of the paper.andM;Similarly, we perceive colors differently under different lightingconditions.andP;  A particularly sticky issue is that color samples produced withdifferent technologies may match under one lighting condition--such asdaylight--but be obviously different under others--such as fluorescentlights.andP;  That's why graphic artists generally view proofs under specificstandard lighting conditions.andM;Another key problem is that each color device--including each monitor andprinter--has a specific set of colors it can produce.andP;  This set of colors,called the color gamut, varies with several factors.andP;  One of the mostimportant is the set of base colors the device uses to create other colors.andM;For example, monitors use the RGB color model, so called because it createscolors by varying the levels of red, green, and blue on the screen.andP;  Printersgenerally use either the CMY (cyan, magenta, yellow) or the related CMYK(cyan, magenta, yellow, black) model.andP;  Since the RGB and CMYK models eachstart with a different group of base colors, it's not surprising that thecolor gamuts for monitors and printers differ significantly, though there issubstantial overlap.andM;Even within a given color model, the color gamut will vary depending on thespecific colors in any given device.andP;  As already mentioned, each of theprinters reviewed here uses slightly different versions of the base colors.andO;As a result, each one has a different color gamut, even though all of themcreate colors with the CMYK model.andP;  In general, two printers of the samemodel will have a closely matched color gamut, since both will use the samebase colors and same process for putting the ink on paper.andM;Consistent color gamuts are far more problematic for monitors than forprinters.andP;  Not only do different manufacturers use different phosphors, buteven two monitors from the same production line may differ because of slightvariations in phosphor thickness or other normal manufacturing deviations.andO;And the color gamut for any specific monitor will change as the phosphorages.andM;What's more, a given set of RGB signal levels sent to a given monitor willproduce different colors depending on the setting for the brightness andcontrast controls.andP;  And, the same set of signals will yield one color whenthe monitor is just turned on, and another when it's warmed up.andP;  As withprinted material, the perceived colors will even change depending on lightingconditions.andM;Given th relative predictability of printer colors compared to screen colors,it's ironic that most people will blame the printer when printed colors don'tmatch the screen.andP;  But as Dale Richmond, Director of Marketing at Seikopoints out, that's exactly what happens.andP;  A secretary or executive willcarefully adjust the screen colors to taste, print the graphic, and thenblame the printer for not producing a match.andP;  Since it's perceived that theprinter is at fault, at least some printer manufacturers feel it's their jobto address the issue.andM;Any color matching system has to at least do three things: First, it needs away to calibrate the monitor, so the system can create a database thatmatches specific RGB signal levels to specific colors.andP;  Second, it needs adatabase of printer colors that matches specific CMY or CMYK values tospecific colors.andP;  And third, it needs a completely objective,device-independent way to describe colors in the first place, so the systemhas a common language of &quot;specific colors&quot; to tanslate from RGB value tocolor description to the CMY or CMYK value for the printer.andM;Fortunately, it's not difficult to find an unambiguous color model.andP;  Thefirst was developed by the CIE (Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage orthe International Commission on Illuminations) in 1931.andP;  It has since beenupdated, and now exists in several variations.andP;  Even better, the colordescription in any variation can be translated to another by straightforwardmathematical formulas.andM;Creating a database of printer colors is also reasonably simple.andP;  As alreadymentioned, there is relatively little variation for individual printers.andO;Manufacturers can easily supply a look-up table with each printer model, inmuch the same spirit as a device driver.andM;In fact, the trickiest part in all this is calibrating the monitor.andP;  There iscurrently no practical way to do that in the DOS world, though there are afew appropriate tools for the Macintosh.andP;  The basic approach is to attach aclor sensor to the screen, typically by suction cup, and let the package runthrough a set of RGB values, read the colors off the screen, and makecompensating adjustments to the video card.andM;Given a way to describe colors objectively, a look-up table for your printer,and the ability to calibrate a monitor, all that remains is to write softwarethat will handle the translation.andP;  Ideally, the software should also show youthe color gamuts of your printer and monitor, so you can compare the two, andknow when you're looking at a color on-screen that your printer simply cannotproduce.andM;As of this writing, at least one complete color matching package--with screencalibration, printer look-up table, and software--has been announced for theMacintosh by SuperMac Technology, and we should be seeing similar packagesfor DOS before too long.andP;  However, as Jim Forrest, Senior Marketing Managerat NEC points out, color for the Macintosh i s two to three years ahead ofcolor for DOS.andP;  Part of the problem is that there are more video standards inthe DOS world to hlep complicate the issue.andP;  And, there is no single colorpicker accessible to all DOS programs the way there is with the Mac.andP;  Windows3.0 may help change that.andM;One important step towards eventual color matching of screens with printersis Adobe's announced PostScript Level 2.andP;  Among other things, Level 2 willincorporate device-independent color description as part of PostScript.andO;According to Adobe, we should be seeing the first Level 2 printers somewherebetween spring 1991 and spring 1992.andM;Another notable development is that Tektronix has developed, and is activelylobbying for, its own color matching system called TekColor.andP;  TekColor is anopen system.andP;  Tecktronix is not only wiling to license it, but according tothose who are discussing the issue with Tektronix, the company is askingreasonable licensing fees.andM;TekColor uses a color model developed by Tektronix.andP;  The model, called HVC,defines each color by its hue (the color family, such as blue or green),value (the variation between light and dark), and chroma (the degree ofsaturation or vibrancy of the color).andP;  This HVC model is a variation on theCIE models and according to Tektronix, dovetails nicely with PostScript Level2.andM;Significantly, QMS, NEC, Seiko, and Oce Graphics are all committed tosupporting PostScript Level 2, and all are at least tracking TekColor colselyas a future possibility.andP;  However, NEC's Forrest, for example, worries thatTekColor's current implementation may be too limited to deal with the fullrange of monitors and printers on the market.andP;  Not surprisingly, there isalso a bit of resistance to the TekColor name from companies that are, afterall, in competition with Tektronix.andM;PICKING A PRINTER NOWandM;Whatever the future of color matching, the reality is that it's not hereyet--at least not in the DOS world.andP;  And for the moment, the question is howto choose a printer from those that exist right now.andP;  With such uniformlygorgeous output, picking a printer won't be easy, unless you need somespecial feature, such as the HPGL emulation that's only available in the QMSand Tektronix printers.andP;  However, here are some issues you'll want toconsider when making your choice.andM;One obvious question is whether you need true Adobe PostScript.andP;  If you planto produce boardroom-level graphics, presentation graphics, or other materialwhere the printed output will be your final product, any of these printerswill do the job.andP;  However, if you're looking to produce proofs for somethingthat will be printed in final form elsewhere, you may want to be moreconservative, and stay with Adobe PostScript.andM;Be aware that text spacing, in particular, may vary between Adobe PostScriptand some other PostScript emulator.andP;  So if you hand a file to a print shop,for example, you may find that lines break at a different spot on your proofand on the final product.andP;  Only the NEC, QMS, and Oce Color printers offerAdobe PostScript.andM;Another basic issue is paper size.andP;  If you need a printer that handles B-sizepaper, you can immediately narrow your search down to the QMS ColorScriptModel 30 (reviewed in the 1989 printer issue), the newly announced Model 30i(QMS says it's essentially identical to the Model 30), and possibly the SeikoColorPoint PS 14.andP;  Although PC Labs hasn't tested the PS 14, Seiko says it'sbasically a wide carriage version of the PS4 that we look at here in itspre-production version (see sidebar &quot;The Seiko ColorPoint PS4: Still in theWings,&quot; for more information).andM;You'll also want to consider the maximum image size, as a separate issue fromthe paper (or transparency) size.andP;  The nature of color printing, with theneed for a separate print pass for each color, puts a high premium onregistration, so that each color is printed in exactly the right place.andP;  Theonly way to get that registration is for the printer mechanism to holdtightly onto the paper--a procedure that creates relatively large margins formachines that use cut sheets.andM;The NEC, QMS, Tektronix, and Oce Graphics printers can all produce an imagethat nearly fills a letter-size page, but only when using larger paper.andP;  Forletter size output, the image sizes for all these printers hover around 8 by9 inches.andP;  The actual numbers are: 8 by 9 inches for the Colormate PS, 8.1 by8.5 inches for the Phaser PX, 8.1 by 9 for the ColorScript 100 Model 10, and8.2 by 9.3 for the OceColor.andM;All four printers will also let you get larger images on larger paper.andP;  Themaximum sizes vary significantly, with the Phaser PX offering the smallestmaximum image size, at 8.1 by 10.8 inches on legal-size paper.andP;  Next in sizeis the OceColor, with a maximum image of 8.2 by 11 inches, then theColorScript 100 Model 10, with a maximum 8.1 by 12 inches.andP;  As tested, theNEC printer did not support legal-size paper, but according to NEC, by thetime this article is published, the firmware will be upgraded to allow 8.1-by 12-inch images.andM;If it's important to get the largest possible image size, you'll want to takea careful look at the Seiko ColorPoint PS 4.andP;  The PS 4 uses roll paperinstead of cut sheets.andP;  This lets it hold the paper by a special printingmargin, then cut off the excess margin when it's done.andP;  The maximum image forthe Seiko printer on letter-size paper is an impressive 8.2 by 10.7 inches.andO;The maximum image on Seiko's super-A size paper is a whopping 8.5 by 13inches.andM;Finally, in looking over the reviews, you'll see some noticeable differencesin graphics speed, ranging from 0.3 gppm to 0.6 gppm.andP;  Since speed is of nodire consequence to a color page printer, these differences aren't importantenough to be primary factors in picking one printer over another.andP;  However,once you've narrowed the field down to one or two possibilities, you may wellwant to consider speed, along with price, as final differentiating factors.andO;Also, we've included text speed because it's part of the standard battery oftests we run on any printer.andP;  Even though text speed is relativelyunimportant in the color world, these numbers can still help you comparethese printers across product categories or merely serve as another decidingfactor in your selection process.andP;  In any case, whatever your needs forhigh-quality color printing, you can't go far wrong with any of thesemachines.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
