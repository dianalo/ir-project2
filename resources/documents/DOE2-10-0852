However, the assessmentof bone is hampered by the complicated and as it were unpredictable patternof bone structure. Therefore, and to compensate for the bias always presentin human observations, a computer aided procedure was developed to detectand describe periodontal bone lesions. This paper describes a comparisonof the performance by human observers and of the computer program. Twoseries of artificial periodontal bone lesions served as material forthe assessments. This study shows that the automated lesion detectionprogram enables an assessment of periodontal bone lesions, which is atleast comparable with the results of a group of experienced observersand probably better. It is considerably better than the results of observersindividually, and decreases the time-dependent variability appearingin repeated assessments of a single observer. The computer aided detectionof periodontal lesions can be considered as a useful and reliable toolin periodontal diagnosis. 9 ref.; 2 figs. Contains author index</TEXT></DOC>
