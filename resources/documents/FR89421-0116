Moran, Building Commissioner of the City ofMaryland Heights, Missouri, filed an inconsistency ruling application.That application requested a ruling concerning the inconsistency with theHMTA of the following prohibition in Section I of the City's Ordinance88-378:<ITAG tagnum="21">No person shall haul sewage, sludge, human excrement, special, hazardousor infectious wastes without providing a bond in the amount of One ThousandDollars ($1,000) per vehicle for each vehicle, hauling or to haul sewage,sludge, human excrement, special, hazardous or infectious waste.</ITAG>The City requested that this section be reviewed for consistency with theinsurance and indemnification requirements of the HMTA.On the issue of consistency, the City stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">We believe this bonding requirement is not in conflict with the HazardousMaterials Transportation Act inasmuch as it imposes an additional requirementupon haulers; it does not exempt, or attempt to exempt them from the requirementsof the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act.</ITAG>On June 6, 1988 (53 FR 20736). OHMT published a Public Notice and InvitationTo Comment soliciting public comments on the City's application. Commentssupporting a finding of inconsistency were filed by E andamp; H Hauling Company,Infectious Waste Management, Inc. (IWM), the Chemical Waste TransportationCouncil (CWTC), the National Tank Truck Carriers, Inc. (NTTC), the AmericanTrucking Associations (ATA), and jointly by the National Private TruckingAssociation (NPTA) and the Private Truck Council of America (PTCA). Nocomments were filed by the City of Maryland Heights or any other partyin support of a finding of consistency.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. General Authority and Preemption Under the HMTA</ITAG>The HMTA at section 112(a) (49 App. U.S.C. 1811(a)) preempts ``* * * anyrequirement, of a State or political subdivision thereof, which is inconsistentwith any requirement set forth in [the HMTA], or in a regulation issuedunder [the HMTA].'' This express preemption provision makes it evidentthat Congress did not intend the HMTA and its regulations to completelyoccupy the field of transportation so as to preclude any state or localaction. The HMTA preempts only those state and local requirements thatare ``inconsistent.'' In the HMTA's Declaration of Policy (section 102) and in the Senate CommerceCommittee language reporting out what became section 112 of the HMTA, Congressindicated a desire for uniform national standards in the field of hazardousmaterials transportation. Congress inserted the preemption language insection 112(a) ``in order to preclude a multiplicity of state and localregulations and the potential for varying as well as conflicting regulationsin the area of hazardous material transportation'' (S. Rep. 1192, 93rdCong., 2d Sess., 37-38 (1974)). Through its enactment of the HMTA, Congressgave the Department the authority to promulgate uniform national standards.While the HMTA did not totally preclude state or local action in this area,Congress apparently intended, to the extent possible, to make such stateor local action unneccessary. The comprehensiveness of the HMR, issuedto implement the HMTA, severely restricts the scope of historically permissiblestate or local activity.Although advisory in nature, inconsistency rulings issued by OHMT under49 CFR Part 107 provide an alternative to litigation for a determinationof the relationship between Federal requirements and those of a state orpolitical subdivision. If a state or political subdivision requirementis found to be inconsistent, the state or local government may apply toOHMT for a waiver of preemption. 49 App. U.S.C. 1811(b); 49 CFR 107.215-107.225.In issuing its advisory inconsistency rulings concerning preemption underthe HMTA, OHMT is guided by the principles enunciated in Executive Order12612 entitled ``Federalism'' (52 FR 41685, Oct. 30, 1987). Section 4(a)of that Executive Order authorizes preemption of state laws only when thestatute contains an express preemption provision, there is other firm andpalpable evidence of Congressional intent to preempt, or the exercise ofstate authority directly conflicts with the exercise of Federal authority.The HMTA, of course, contains an express preemption provision, which OHMThas implemented through regulations and interpreted in a long series ofinconsistency rulings beginning in 1978.Since these proceedings are conducted pursuant to the HMTA, only the questionof statutory preemption under the HMTA will be considered. A court mightfind a non-Federal requirement preempted for other reasons, such as statutorypreemption under another Federal statute, preemption under state law, orpreemption by the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution because of anundue burden on interstate commerce. However, OHMT does not make such determinationsin its inconsistency ruling process.OHMT has incorporated into its procedures (49 CFR 107.209(c)) the followingcriteria for determining whether a state or local requirement is consistentwith, and thus not preempted by, the HMTA:<ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Whether compliance with both the non-Federal requirement and theAct or the regulations issued under the Act is possible; and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) The extent to which the non-Federal requirement is an obstacleto the accomplishment and execution of the Act and the regulations issuedunder the Act.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">These criteria are based upon, and supported by, U.S. Supreme Courtdecisions on preemption. <T3>Hines </T3>v. <T3>Davidowitz, </T3>312 U.S. 52 (1941); <T3>Florida Lime andamp; Avocado Growers, Inc. </T3>v. <T3>Paul, </T3>373 U.S. 132 (1963); <T3>Ray </T3>v. <T3>Atlantic Richfield Co., </T3>435 U.S. 151 (1978).The first criterion, the ``dual compliance'' test, concerns those non-Federalrequirements which are irreconcilable with Federal requirements; that is,compliance with the non-Federal requirement causes the Federal requirementto be violated, or <T3>vice versa. </T3>The second criterion, the ``obstacle'' test, involvesdetermining whether a state or local requirement is an obstacle to executingand accomplishing the purposes of the HMTA and the HMR; a requirement whichis such an obstacle is inconsistent. Application of this second criterionrequires an analysis of the non-Federal requirement in light of the requirementsof the HMTA and the HMR, as well as the purposes and objectives of Congressin enacting the HMTA and the manner and extent to which those purposesand objectives have been carried out through OHMT's regulatory program.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Public Comments</ITAG>As indicated above, the City of Maryland Heights stated in its applicationits belief that this bonding requirement is ``not in conflict'' with theHMTA. As discussed in more detail below, all six commenters who respondedto OHMT's <T4>Federal Register </T4>Notice opposed a finding of consistency.E andamp; H Hauling Company, Maryland Heights, states that there is no needfor a local bond because of existing liability requirements for hazardouswaste transporters. It argues that the ordinance was passed to hinder thesolid waste transporting business, and it claims the ordinance is discriminatorybecause it does not apply to transporters of other hazardous materials(e.g., propane or gasoline). Finally, it contends that the ordinance wouldbe difficult to enforce without permanent roadblocks or inspections ofall trucks entering the City.IWM states that the scarcity of licensed disposal facilities results inlong transportation distances for sludge, special, hazardous or infectiouswastes. IWM continues: <ITAG tagnum="21">Therein lies the problem. As an example, Maryland Heights is one ofover 100 communities in the St. Louis Metropolitan Area and is locatedon two Interstate Highways. If each City in the Metro area adopted an Ordinanceof this type and only thirty DOT regulated trucks traveled through thisarea, it is conceivable that consumer prices on certain products and servicescould rise in excess of three (3) million dollars annually for the St.Louis consumers alone. On a nationwide basis this figure could reach intothe billions. It should also be pointed out that layered bonding causesadditional administrative expense at the local level with no return tothe citizens.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">IWM concludes that trucking bonds can be enforced and administeredmore efficiently at the state or Federal level than at the local leveland urges that bonding of regulated trucking be limited to the state andFederal levels.CWTC, on behalf of hazardous waste transporters, contends that the City'sbonding requirement is inconsistent for several reasons. First, it contendsthat it is inconsistent with andSection;177.853(a) of the HMR because itwill cause rerouting of hazardous materials around the City.Second, CWTC argues that this ``artificial routing'' will be done withoutadequate safety justification and appropriate coordination with adjoiningaffected jurisdictions_allegedly in violation of the tenets set forth inInconsistency Ruling No. IR-1 (IR-1), 43 FR 16954 (Apr. 20, 1978); IR-2,43 FR 75566 (Dec. 20, 1979), <T3>appeal </T3>45 FR 71881 (Oct. 30, 1980), <T3>correction, </T3>45 FR 76838 (Nov. 20, 1980); IR-3, 46 FR 18918 (Mar.26, 1981), <T3>appeal, </T3>47 FR 18457 (Apr. 29, 1982); IR-20, 52 FR 24396 (June30, 1987), <T3>correction, </T3>52 FR 29468 (Aug. 7, 1987).Third, CWTC asserts that the City's bonding requirement will divert trafficoff the I-270 beltway and onto non-interstate routes or interstates (e.g.,I-170) through more densely populated areas. This effect allegedly wouldcontravene a 1977 RSPA interpretation of 49 CFR 387.9.Fourth, CWTC states that the City has failed to make the purportedly requiredshowing that $1,000 is a reasonable and appropriate amount for the requiredbond.Fifth, CWTC contends that the City's requirement is inconsistent with thefinancial requirements of 49 CFR 387.15. It argues that, despite statementsto the contrary in the Public Notice on this matter, RSPA must considerconsistency with those requirements_as it allegedly previously did in IR-10,49 FR 46645 (Nov. 27, 1984), <T3>correction, </T3>50 FR 1939 (Mar. 12, 1985); IR-11, 49 FR 46647 (Nov.27, 1984); IR-15, 49 FR 46660 (Nov. 27, 1984); IR-15 (Appeal), 52 FR 13062(Apr. 20, 1987); IR-18, 52 FR 200 (Jan. 2, 1987), <T3>appeal, </T3>53 FR 28850 (July 29, 1988).Sixth, CWTC claims that the City's bonding requirement is inequitable becauseit is not levied on the transportation of all hazardous materials. It pointsto the irony that a bond is required for hazardous wastes but not for undilutednon-waste hazardous materials which are more toxic and hazardous than thewaste materials.Finally, CWTC argues that the cumulative effect of multiple state and localbonding requirements would be to ban the transportation of hazardous waste.NTTC argues that the City's bonding requirement is inconsistent for severalreasons. It contends that it is a form of tax or fee applicable becauseof the nature of the commodity transported and that it will prompt transportationdelays in violation of the HMR.NTTC contends that the City's bonding requirement fails the ``dual compliance''test for consistency. It contends that, unlike the Illinois fee involvedin IR-17, 51 FR 20925 (June 9, 1986), and IR-17 (Appeal), 52 FR 36200 (Sept.25, 1987), <T3>correction,</T3> 52 FR 37399 (Oct. 6, 1987), the City's requirementdoes not support an otherwise consistent safety regulatory program. Italso points to unnecessary delays which would be caused by roadside checksto enforce the City's requirements, by carriers' routing their trucks aroundthe City, and by the administrative delays necessarily involved in obtainingthe required bond. It argues that the potential for replication by otherjurisdictions is relevant because the result will be massive disruptionsin traffic flows, a factor which it says must be considered under the ``DOTenabling act,'' which directs the Secretary to ``promote'' transportation.In addition, NTTC contends that the City's requirement fails the ``obstacletest'' for consistency. It argues that, because the City's ordinance providesno compliance methodology or details concerning guarantors or beneficiaries,the Ordinance is a transparent attempt to export risks to other jurisdictionsby discouraging the hauling of hazardous wastes through the City. NTTCalso urges that consideration be given to ``burden of commerce'' arguments_despiterejection of such arguments in IR-17 (Appeal), <T3>supra</T3>_because the potential threat of widespread fees and similarfinancial requirements has became a reality; it contends that the ``burdenon commerce'' argument must be considered by OHMT in deciding inconsistencyapplications because astute state or local governments will not requestwaivers of preemption (which would open the door for consideration of ``burdenon commerce'' issues). The NPTA and the PTCA, in their joint comments, contend that the City'sbonding requirement is inconsistent for three reasons. First, they assertthat the requirement of a bond as a precondition to hazardous materialstransportation would result in rerouting by carriers and an exportationof risk to other communities and thus constitutes a <T3>de facto</T3> ban on hazardous materials transportation. They citeIR-10, <T3>supra,</T3> in support of this contention. In addition, they arguethat the rerouting effects of the City's bonding requirement will be aggravatedby the existing Federal motor carrier insurance requirements in 49 CFR387.15. Second, they contend that the City's requirement will result in unnecessarydelays in transit for many shipments because of the rerouting that requirementwill cause. Such delays, they argue, result in a direct conflict with andSection;177.853 of the HMR, which directs that highway shipments proceed withoutunnecessary delay. Third, they assert that the City's requirement is inconsistent becauseof potential multiplicity. In support of this argument, they quote fromIR-10, <T3>supra</T3>:<ITAG tagnum="21">[I]f any one State may use insurance requirements to deflect interstatecarriers of hazardous materials into other jurisdictions, then all Statesmay do so. The logical result would be, if not a total cessation of a Congressionallyrecognized form of interstate transportation then the very patchwork ofvarying and conflicting state and local regulations which Congress soughtto preclude.</ITAG>49 FR 46647. NPRA and PTCA also cite IR-6 as declaring City of Covington,Kentucky, prenotification requirements inconsistent for the same reasons.ATA challenges the consistency of the City's requirements on several grounds.It points out that the City's Ordinance states that the ``bond shall assurethat the provisions of the Ordinance are satisified'' and ``shall inureto the benefit of the City of Maryland Heights and persons residing therein.''ATA claims that the bond is used to enforce compliance with other provisionsof the Ordinance, including requirements to have an annual waste transportationlicense, to be inspected, to display a sticker, to have specified levelsof insurance, and to have vehicles and containers which meet City constructionrequirements.ATA also states that the City contains segments of four major interstatehighways near the Missouri-Illinois border and that City Manager Moranstated that the City believes it has authority under this Ordinance toregulate trucks passing through the City on Interstate highways and statehighways. Having set forth these premises, ATA advances three separate argumentsagainst the consistency of the City's requirement. It first argument isthat the City's requirement is inconsistent with the national uniformityintended by Congress in enacting the HMTA, as reflected in 49 CFR 177.800.They perceive the City's Ordinance as a precedent leading to adoption ofdifferent regulations by many jurisdictions which would interfere withcompliance with the HMR and reduce safety.This lack of uniformity, ATA asserts, is demonstrated by the City's prohibitingthe use of drivers and vehicles meeting all HMR requirements from transportinghazardous wastes in the City unless the vehicle is bonded, licensed, inspected,insured and constructed in compliance with the City's Ordinance. In particular,ATA points to ``ambiguous'' requirements that ``vehicles and containersused shall be constructed_so as to prevent wastes from spilling'' and shall``have spillproof bodies.'' ATA's second argument is that the City's Ordinance would create unnecessarydelays in transportation in conflict with andSection; 177.853 of the HMR.It expresses concern that delays would result from City inspections toenforce the bonding requirement and from carriers having to await the availabilityof those specific vehicles in their fleets for which they have obtaineda required bond. ATA argues that these delays would not only violate andSection;177.853but also would constitute an obstacle to compliance with the HMR underIR-22, 52 FR 46574 (Dec. 8, 1987), <T3>correction,</T3> 52 FR 49107 (Dec. 29, 1987). ATA's third argument is that the City's bonding requirement is an inconsistentrouting restriction or ban. It contends that the minimal bond level cannotmeasurably increase safety, particularly in light of the 49 CFR 387.15[actually andSection;andSection; 387.7 and 387.9] requirement for $1,000,000liability insurance for carriers of hazardous waste in interstate commerce.Nevertheless, ATA contends these bonds will be difficult, costly or impossibleto obtain. Therefore, it argues, the bonding requirement will force somecarriers to avoid the City and that, therefore, the Ordinance really isa routing restriction or <T3>de facto</T3> ban. ATA contends that the Ordinance is inconsistent as either a hazardous materialsrouting restriction or ban. It points out that IR-23, 53 FR 16840 (May11, 1988), requires routing restrictions to be preceded by a determinationof effect on overall public safety and consultation with other affectedjurisdictions_neither of which is reflected in the record here. ATA furtherstates that IR-23 indicates that the power to ban is exclusively Federaland that local bans generally are inconsistent.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Ruling</ITAG>While many of the issues raised in the comments (e.g., delays, routingrestrictions, bans, equipment requirements, etc.) may have merit, it isunnecessary to discuss them in order to determine the consistency of theCity of Maryland Heights' bonding requirement for the transportation ofhazardous wastes.A local government may not impose any insurance, bonding or indemnificationrequirement as a precondition to the transportation of hazardous materials.It is necessary to discuss the imposition of such requirements to bothradioactive materials and other hazardous materials because the City'sbonding requirement appears to apply to both radioactive and non-radioactivehazardous wastes. This issue previously has been resolved with respectto radioactive materials, and this ruling addresses this issue with respectto other hazardous materials, specifically hazardous wastes.Several prior inconsistency rulings have made it clear that indemnification,bonding or insurance requirements for radioactive materials transportationdiffering from Federal requirements are inconsistent. IR-10, IR-11, IR-15,IR-15 (Appeal), IR-18, all <T3>supra</T3>; IR-18 (Appeal), 53 FR 28850 (July 29, 1988). This conclusionwas stated succinctly by the RSPA Administrator in IR-15 (Appeal):<ITAG tagnum="21">The indemnification level established through the HMR, coupled withthe indemnification provisions of the Price-Anderson Act (42 U.S.C. 2210),provides the exclusive standard for radioactive materials transportationindemnification. They have totally occupied that field, and any state orlocal bond, insurance or indemnification requirement not identical to theHMR requirement is an obstacle to the accomplishment of the objectivesof the HMTA and the HMR.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">52 FR 13062.</ITAG>However, no prior inconsistency ruling or court decision has consideredthe consistency under the HMTA or the HMR of a local bonding, insuranceor indemnification requirement for the transportation of non-radioactivehazardous materials. There is no such requirement in the HMR. OHMT is determiningherein, in accordance with <T3>Ray v. Atlantic Richfield Co</T3>., 435 U.S. 151 (1978), that no suchrequirement is necessary_particularly because 49 CFR 387.7 and 387.9 alreadyrequire insurance or surety bonds of between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000for motor carriers transporting hazardous wastes, hazardous substancesand other hazardous materials.If OHMT later determines that a bonding, insurance, or indemnity requirementis necessary under the HMTA for the transportation of non-radioactive hazardousmaterials, it will amend the HMR accordingly. Until such time, the absenceof such a requirement in the HMR is a reflection of OHMT's determinationthat no such requirement is necessary and that any such requirement imposedat the state or local level is inconsistent with the HMR.The subject of bonding, insurance and indemnity requirements for hazardousmaterials transportation is exclusively Federal. The existence in the U.S.of more than 30,000 local jurisdictions, each having the potential to imposesuch requirements, demonstrates the havoc which could be created if evena small percentage of them were to impose such requirements (with theirinevitable differences). It would be extremely difficult for carriers tolearn about, let alone comply with, such local requirements.As indicated in IR-10, <T3>supra</T3>, at 46647, this regulatory subject is the type of subject(insurance) about which Congress was concerned when it included preemptionlanguage in the HMTA ``in order to preclude a multiplicity of state andlocal regulations and the potential for varying as well as conflictingregulations in the area of hazardous material transportation.'' S. Rep.1192, 93rd Cong., 2d Sess., 37-38 (1974). Thus, non-Federal bonding, insuranceand indemnity requirements for hazardous materials transportation regulatedunder the HMTA fail the ``obstacle'' test and are inconsistent with theHMR.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Ruling</ITAG>For the foregoing reasons and on the basis of this record, I find thatSection I of Ordinance 88-378 of the City of Maryland Heights, Missouri,is inconsistent with the HMR to the extent it applies to hazardous materialsregulated under the HMTA, and, therefore, is preempted to that extent undersection 112(a) of the HMTA (49 App. U.S.C. 1811(a)).Any appeal of this ruling must be filed within 30 days of service in accordancewith 49 CFR 107.211.<ITAG tagnum="6">Alan I.
