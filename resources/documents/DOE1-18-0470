<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-18-0470 </DOCNO><TEXT>The magnetic field is calculated between two parallel semi-infinite polefaces, one of them having suffered a shift with respect to the otherover a small distance. The influence of this shift on the ion orbitsand the focussing properties is investigated. The theory provides a directnumerical evaluation of the magnitude of the aberrations. The most prominentaberration is an obliquity of the image.</TEXT></DOC>
