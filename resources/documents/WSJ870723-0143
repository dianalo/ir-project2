The company, known as MBB, swung to a group loss of 103.7 million marks ($55.8 million) from profit of 109 million marks in 1985. Its chairman, Hanns-Arnt Vogels, said the deficit was largely caused by a 150 million-mark capital injection by MBB into its Deutsche Airbus G.m.b.H. unit, which holds 37.9% of Airbus.    MBB also was hurt by a severe slump in the world helicopter market and by the troubles in the American and European space programs.    Group sales fell 7% last year, to 5.6 billion marks ($3 billion) from six billion marks.    For 1987, Mr. Vogels said, MBB is likely to post a deficit of about 95 million marks because the development of the Airbus A330 and A-340 models will require another 150 million marks in capital from the German company.    In June, the German government said that it would contribute three billion marks over the next seven years for the development of the new models and that it would assume 1.9 billion marks in MBB debt from earlier Airbus projects. The package was below the seven billion marks MBB had sought. </TEXT></DOC>
