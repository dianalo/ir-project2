Grace andamp; Co. said its American Breeders Service unitacquired a competitor's patents covering the technology thatpermits scientists to &quot;clone&quot; cows.   The specialty chemical concern, based in New York, didn'tdisclose what its unit paid to acquire the patents and patentapplications from Granada Biosciences Inc., beyond sayingthat the Houston concern will receive a lump-sum payment andcertain future royalties.</LP><TEXT>   American Breeders and Granada are the two most prominentplayers among the handful of companies involved in cowcloning.   That cloning technology has been proven to work, but isn'tyet commercially feasible. A central element in the techniqueinvolves what is known as &quot;nuclear transplantation.&quot;   In that procedure, scientists remove an embryo from a cow,days after fertilization has taken place. Each of theembryo's 30 to 40 cells are transferred to &quot;surrogate eggs,&quot;that replicate the genetic material from the specially chosenparents. In theory, hundreds of carbon-copy cows could beproduced, by splitting and transferring the surrogate eggs.An American Breeders official said the company has produced&quot;between 40 and 50&quot; cows in this manner, but noted that thesuccess rate of such procedures remains too low to becommercially viable. It will be &quot;two or three years,&quot; hesaid, before the technology is ready for market.   The aim of the procedure is to repeatedly duplicate a cowgenetically favored with a high milk yield or diseaseresistance. While American Breeders currently focuses ondairy herds, the technology could also be applied to createidentical beef cattle that are easier to process and have themaximum amount of the cuts consumers seek.   The purchase of its competitor's patents should giveAmerican Breeders &quot;an advantage as it enters the clonedbovine embryo market,&quot; the company said. It noted that thetransaction puts to rest any potential disputes over possiblyoverlapping patents held by the competitors. That may in turneliminate &quot;an element of uncertainty&quot; for customers and&quot;promote the rapid commercialization of cloning in the dairyindustry,&quot; Grace said.</TEXT></DOC>
