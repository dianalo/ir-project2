(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Space shuttle managers began atwo-day meeting Friday to select a date for launching Atlantis on aclassified military mission.   The working target has been Feb. 22, but officials want toassess the readiness of all launch elements before setting a firmdate Saturday.   NASA said a delay in replacing a faulty engine turbopump couldcause a one-day slip, but the agency said it was hoping the timecould be made up. A new pump was installed Friday and leak checkswill be conducted Saturday.   If the Feb. 22 date holds, Atlantis is scheduled to blast off at1:14 a.m. with a crew of five astronauts.   For security reasons, neither the Pentagon nor NASA willidentify the satellite, but sources close to the project report itis a highly sophisticated reconnaissance satellite that will gatherinformation over the Soviet Union and a wide area of the globe.</TEXT></DOC>
