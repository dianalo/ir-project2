<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-66-0373 </DOCNO><TEXT>A review is presented of the properties of the hadronic component in neutrinointeractions through its manifestations in diffractive (axial-) vectormeson production, in coherent interactions on nuclei - in particularsingle pion production and rho meson production -, and in total crosssections at small Q/sup 2/ -valves, - including the observation of shadowing.Detailed studies give support to the ideas of meson dominance in thecase of the weak current; in particular, tests of the PCAC hypothesisat high energy are provided by the study of single pion coherent productionand of upsilon(-bar) total cross section at Q/sup 2/ {yields} 0.</TEXT></DOC>
