(Products).andO;Product:   R and R Relational Report Writer (Report generating software)(evaluation).andO;Topic:     EvaluationReport GeneratorsProgram Development SoftwareStructured Query Language.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Many software vendors have been caught up in the mad dash to create frontends to database servers.andP;  While some new companies have sprung up to delivernew products into the arena (Channel Computing from last month's column, forexample), many of the products available now are retooled versions of onesthat have been with us for some time.andP;  Unfortunately, their originalarchitecture does not always map well to SQL databases.andP;  Concentric DataSystems' flagship product Randamp;R Report Writer, however, makes the transitionsmoothly.andM;Unlike the product i reviewed in last month's column (Channel Computing'sForest andamp; Trees), Randamp;R Report Writer is easy to classify.andP;  It is a powerful andversatile report writer that is equally useful as either a programming or anend-user tool.andM;Randamp;R has its roots in the world of Dbase.andP;  It is the most widely usedindependent report writer in its market (with over 80,000 units sold todate).andP;  It consistently wins awards, including the 1989 and 1990 DBMSmagazine Reader's Choice awards.andM;One of the strengths Randamp;R brings to the front end is its relative maturity.andO;Developers and users alike are struggling with newer tools as vendors workthe bugs out.andM;Another advantage to using Randamp;R is ease of use: The report writing toolsavailable from the major SQL database vendors (Oracle, for example) areenough to make a developer sweat.andP;  Most end users have no hope of producingreports of any value with these tools.andP;  To the rescue comes Randamp;R Report Writerfor SQL.andP;  Concentric is currently providing versions for just a few SQL-baseddatabases (Oracle Server, XDB, and NetWare SQL).andP;  If these database vendorswere smart, they would follow Wordtech's lead and package Randamp;R right in withtheir own tools.andM;Highlights of Randamp;R include its Lotus-style menus, a screen painter, diverseformatting control, calculated fields, 70 built-in functions, and aroyalty-free run-time capability.andP;  One of Randamp;R's best features is its abilityto remember what you just did, and to apply that bit of knowledge to what youare about to do (more on this later).andM;FunctionalityandM;Anyone familiar with Lotus 1-2-3 will find Randamp;R's menus for building reports abreeze to learn and use.andP;  Four of the seven sections of the report definitionare optional, but most reports require that nearly all the sections be filledin.andM;You can start the program using a variety of command switches (such as /U forusername), or you can let Randamp;R prompt you as you go.andP;  After you have enteredyour user name and password, which Randamp;R automatically validates with thedatabase, you have to either identify an existing report library or reate anew one.andP;  Report libraries are files in which your report definitions aresaved.andP;  They give you a logical way to organize your reports.andP;  A developermight set up libraries associated with each development project, forinstance, whereas an end user might set them up according to the days reportsare to be run.andM;Once you pick or create a library, you can create, delete, modify, or run areport.andP;  If you choose to create a report, Randamp;R pops up a list of databasetables to which you have access and lets you select the master database tablefor your report.andP;  After the master table has been selected, you can chooseadditional tables to provide data for the report, and set the relationshipsbetween the various tables.andP;  The number of tables that can be usedsimultaneously in any report is ten for Oracle Server, eight for NetWare SQL,and ten for XDB.andP;  When you define the relationships you are prompted todefine the type of join.andP;  Randamp;R supports outer joins to the same extent thatthey are supported in the back end.andP;  All three currently-supported databaseservers support at least one outer join per table.andM;In addition to the fields you have made available via the table/relationshipselection, you can create calculated or total fields.andP;  Randamp;R's ability to dothis is remarkably powerful.andP;  It includes over 70 predefined functions andlets you define additional functions.andP;  When you define calculated or totalfields, they are added to the list of available fields.andM;Report layout is done by adding lines and fields to various areas of thereport.andP;  The areas are:  Title, Page Header, Page Footer, Group Header, GroupFooter, Body, and Summary.andP;  Each of these areas can contain template text,data fields from tables, calculated fields, and total fields.andP;  Randamp;R supportsthe standard Dbase data types: numeric, character, date, logical, and memo.andO;It provides automatic conversions from the database server data types, butdoes not support LONG and RAW types for Oracle, NOTE and LVAR for NetWareSQL, or LONG VARCHAR for XDB.andM;Setting up sorting and grouping specifications and row selection criteria isdone without using SQL.andP;  Randamp;R has had these features all along, so you use itsmenus for sorting/grouping and row selection, and Randamp;R takes care of creatingthe appropriate SQL syntax for the back end.andM;The print menu allows you to set print options (page length or top margin,for example), choose the destination for output (display, printer, or file),and run the report.andP;  It also lets you view or print the report specification,which includes a variety of information about the report you have designed(including the SQL statement that Randamp;R has generated behind the scenes).andM;The functionality I have described so far makes Randamp;R complete as an end-usertool.andP;  Fortunately for database developers, Concentric has included anadvanced run-time capability.andP;  The substantial memory requirement of therun-time engine (260K) is alleviated by a run-time swapper.andP;  Using these twoprograms, you can generate Randamp;R reports from within virtually any type ofapplication.andM;I expected to find some conflicts between the run-time swapper and Oracle'sclient tools.andP;  Surprisingly, there weren't any when using the Oracleprotected-mode memory environment.andP;  However, I did frequently receive an&quot;insufficient memory&quot; error when I was running the tools and applications inreal mode.andP;  Concentric's support line team had me fax a memory map to them,which convinced them they couldn't help me.andP;  They reported that Randamp;R version3's swapper is fairly primitive, and in some cases just does not work.andO;Developers will have to use trial and error for determining whichapplications can use the run-time feature.andM;Ease of UseandM;Once you have identified the master database table, Randamp;R presents threelayouts from which to select the default format for reports.andP;  This feature isa tremendous time saver because many reports will require relatively minorchanges to the default.andP;  There is a limitation in the two default formatsthat present the table columns horizontally: Randamp;R truncates columns in theselected table once it reaches a total width of 254 characters.andP;  Any columnsbeyond that width must be added manually.andM;Putting together your first report is not particularly intuitive, so I wouldrecommend setting up some of the sample reports in the tutorial.andM;Once you master the basics, picking up on Randamp;R's advanced features requiresonly a bit of intuition, some trial and error, and occasional use of theon-line context-sensitive help system and documentation.andP;  Each help screenreferences the appropriate related pages in the manual.andP;  Using the help indexand the &quot;jump to related topics&quot; features, I was able to quickly find what Ineeded, although a search feature that allows you to type in a word and seeall related help would be useful.andM;A feature of Randamp;R that I found particularly impressive is the program'sability to keep track of what you just did in order to simplify the nextlogical step.andP;  Even though that next step may take place in a differentmodule of the menuing system, Randamp;R is usually one step ahead of you.andP;  Forexample, after you create a calculated field you usually proceed to thelayout module to place the new field onto your report layout.andP;  When you popup the field selection window, the cursor will be pointing directly to thefield you just created.andP;  Little tricks like this significantly speed reportcreation.andM;An interesting attribute of the current implementation of Randamp;R for SQLdatabase servers is that you never enter any SQL.andP;  Depending on your ownparticular bias, you may consider this to be a plus or a minus.andP;  While I'm aSQL convert, I think that Concentric has taken the correct approach bymaintaining consistency with the non-SQL versions of Randamp;R.andP;  As it is, theirmethod maps extremely well to SQL, and you can go to the report specificationsection at any time and see the current condition of your SQL statement.andP;  Anyvendor that didn't provide at least this capability would be making a seriousmistake.andM;Hardware, Software RequirementsandM;Each database server requires a physically different package of Randamp;R.andP;  Randamp;RReport Writer for NetWare SQL works with version 2.10 or later of the NetWareSQL VAP, and also works with the newly released NetWare SQL NLM.andP;  Randamp;R ReportWriter for XDB SQL supports version 2.3 or later.andP;  Randamp;R for Oracle SQL workswith Oracle versions 5 and later.andM;All SQL versions of Randamp;R require a machine running PC or MSDOS 3.0 or later.andO;For a network installation, support of NETBIOS under DOS 3.1 or later isneeded.andP;  The program requires 350K of available memory (after your networkanddatabase connectivity software are loaded) and at least 1MB of disk space.andO;Because of the minimal memory requirements, this is one of those rare frontends you could comfortably hand to people working with networked IBM XTs andcompatibles.andM;ConnectivityandM;We did most of our testing against ORACLE Server.andP;  We used both Oracle Serverfor OS/2 on a microsoft LAN Manager network and Oracle Server for Vines on aBanyan Vines network.andP;  The product performed flawlessly and identically inboth situations.andP;  However, the report specifications are not portable betweeneach of the database versions.andM;Documentation and SupportandM;The manual is a detailed, mature reference book of nearly 400 pages.andP;  It iswell indexed and makes generous use of subheadings to help you quickly findthe desired section.andM;The chapter on the crucial Query function is especially straightforward.andP;  Itavoids going into SQL syntax, which might confuse a non-SQL-literate enduser.andP;  Instead, each SQL version has an appendix that concisely summarizeshow that database's particular SQL implementation affects the operation ofRandamp;R.andP;  Most people begin using new software products without first reading thedocumentation.andP;  This was my approach with Randamp;R.andP;  Later, when I went back tomethodically review the manual I discovered that I was missing out on anamazing number of shortcuts.andP;  So a word to the wise: READ THE DOC.andM;Concentric offers 30 days of free customer support and several paid supportoptions after that period.andP;  We found the support personnel to beknowledgeable and helpful, but the service usually operated on a &quot;call-back&quot;basis and was only open until 6 p.m.andP;  Eastern time (a potential problem forWesterners and nightowls).andM;Future PlansandM;In December, Concentric released a new version of Randamp;R for Dbase (Randamp;R version4).andP;  Barry Gerken, Concentric's vice president of marketing, told me theirstrategy calls for more additions to the version 3 product line before theyupgrade existing version 3 products to version 4.andP;  He mentioned SQL Serverand Paradox as possible new version 3 products.andP;  For those of us with asignificant interest in SQL Server front ends, the release of a robust andeasy-to-use report writer is eagerly anticipated.andP;  Mr. Gerken also mentionedpossible plans to broaden their front-end workstation platform beyond DOS (toUNIX, for example).andM;There are a number of exciting new features in version 4.andP;  They include:andM;* Enhanced printer drivers for publication-quality outputandM;* Support for proportional fontsandM;* A WYSIWYG full-page print previewandM;* More automatic report choicesandM;* Preprocessed totals (for percent-of-totals, for example)andM;* Enhanced label printing featureandM;* Improved run-time capabilities (a new swapper, for example)andM;I saw a demonstration of version 4, and can safely say that Concentric isvery concerned with addressing the major desires of their user community.andO;The product includes powerful enhancements across the board.andM;SummaryandM;Randamp;R version 3 for SQL is a strong product that can produce myriad types ofreports.andP;  However, the lack of a Windows product or announced plans for onehurts.andP;  Also, connections to more of the major database servers (MicrosoftSQL Server and IBM OS/2 Database Manager in particular) are critical if Randamp;Ris to become the report writer of choice in the PC database server community.andM;Users of Randamp;R for Dbase will find that the SQL versions of the product makefor a very smooth transition into the world of client-server computing (atleast as far as report writing is concerned).andM;If you use one of the database servers currently supported, you shouldseriously consider Randamp;R as a reporting tool.andP;  If you use or intend to use anonsupported database server, call Concentric and let them know.andM;Robert C. Bolt is president of Database Server Systems, a San Francisco-basedfirm specializing in database servers and distributed DBMSs.andP;  He can bereached at 415-583-3000.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
