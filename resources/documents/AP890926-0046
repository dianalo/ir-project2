The walkout gave 435,000 children an unexpected holiday when allbut two of Utah's 40 school districts were closed down Monday.   The strike was incited by the Legislature's decision during aspecial session last week to give residents a $38.4 million taxrebate, and not to allocate money to education from a $94 millionsurplus.   The walkout began with a wildcat strike Friday morning at DavisHigh School in Davis County, just north of Salt Lake City, andspread to schools in three other large school districts by the endof the day.   Republican Gov. Norm Bangerter and the Republican-controlledLegislature, who drew the wrath of teachers as they previously drewthe ire of taxpayers for a record tax hike two years ago, pledgedmoney would be found for education during the regular legislativesession, which begins in January.   With a population of 1.7 million, Utah has the largest averagehousehold size at 3.17, compared with the national average of 2.62.Nearly 70 percent of its residents are members of the MormonChurch, which encourages large families, and the state has thenation's highest percentage of school-age children, with 37 percentunder 18.   With a student-teacher ratio of 25.4 to 1, Utah also has themost overcrowded classrooms, and at $22,621 a year its teachersearn smaller salaries than educators in 43 other states, accordingto the union. The state ranks 50th in the average annualexpenditure per student of $2,326, according to the union.   Years of budget cuts have produced increasing complaints aboutoutdated textbooks and inadequate supplies, with many teacherssaying they've had to pay hundreds of dollars out of their ownpockets to provide basic supplies.   ``We've had truck drivers, steelworkers, housewives, retiredworkers and parents calling to say, `It's about time,''' saidCampbell, whose organization represents up to 90 percent of thestate's teachers.   Bob Chase, vice president of the National Education Association,assured more than 3,000 teachers gathered at Liberty Park on Mondaythat they had the support of some 2 million teachers for their``courageous act of conscience.''   Bangerter defended the tax cut.   ``You have to remember I was the one who raised taxes two yearsago,'' he said.   That record tax hike sparked tax-slashing initiatives that weredefeated by nearly a 2-to-1 margin in November's election, but thegovernor and legislative leaders decided to cut taxes when aneconomic resurgence brought the budget surplus.   The governor has said teachers should have waited until theregular legislative session to press their demands, but heacknowledged the walkout got attention.   ``There is a perception out there that all of the money has beengiven back. It hasn't,'' Bangerter said. ``After the tax cut thatwas passed by the Legislature, we still have a $55 million surplusthis year and $100 million from the last two years.''   He said education would be treated ``honorably and honestly'' inJanuary.</TEXT></DOC>
