(SpecialIssue Supplement on Software Engineering)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Lantz, Andy.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>There are various debugging options available at the differentstages of software design and integration that can make locatingsoftware bugs easier.andP;  Adherence to strict coding standards andreview processes as well as top-down design can all add to thesimplification of debugging.andP;  Top-level design reviews can helpfind bugs at a project's conceptual level.andP;  C is the preferredhigh-level language for coding embedded-systems applications andgreatly affects debugging.andP;  C is more flexible than otherlanguages but it can also cause programmers to create seriouspointer bugs.andP;  The lint program is a compile-time aid that can behelpful in preventing C bugs.andP;  Engineers can use simulators todebug software before the hardware is ready.andP;  Emulators and ROMmonitors allow integration and testing of hardware in conjunctionwith the software.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     DebuggingC Programming LanguageEmbedded SystemsSoftware DesignProgram Development Techniques.andO;Feature:   illustrationprogramphotograph.andO;Caption:   Function prototypes.
