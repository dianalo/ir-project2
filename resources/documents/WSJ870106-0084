Separately, Reliance Financial bought additional stock in two other companies -- increasing its holdings in Dallas-based Lomas andamp; Nettleton Financial Corp. to 8.8%, and boosting its stake in Bohemia, N.Y.-based Symbol Technologies Inc. to the equivalent of 26.2% of the common outstanding.    In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Reliance Financial said it controls 5,483,700 Tiger common shares, including 350,000 shares purchased Dec. 29 and 30 for $9.27 to $9.73 each.    In a separate SEC filing, Reliance Financial said it increased its stake in Lomas andamp; Nettleton to 2,521,600 common shares by purchasing 869,400 shares Dec. 29 and 30 for $25.05 to $28.62 each.    Reliance Financial's third SEC filing reported that it holds the equivalent of 1,605,667 Symbol Technologies common shares, assuming it exercises warrants to purchase 610,000 shares. The stake includes 160,000 shares purchased from Dec. 29 through Wednesday for $17 to $18.92 a share, the filing said.    None of the filings gave a reason for Reliance Financial's additional stock purchases. The New York investment firm buys large stakes in companies it considers attractive investments.    A Reliance Financial spokeswoman said the firm had no comment beyond the contents of the filing. In Los Angeles, a spokeswoman for Tiger declined to comment on the filing. A spokesman for Lomas andamp; Nettleton also declined to comment, and Symbol Technologies officials couldn't be reached for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
