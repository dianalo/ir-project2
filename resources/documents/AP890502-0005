Nearly half of 318 elementary school children surveyed worriedthey were overweight, and more than a third said they had attempteddiets, according to a study released Monday.   ``This study tells us that it's not just the 15-, 20- or40-year-olds who feel they're overweight _ 9- and 10-year-olds feelthe same way,'' said Dr. Michael J. Maloney, director of psychiatryand psychology at Children's Hospital Medical Center in Cincinnati.   The study, ``A Survey of Dieting Behavior and Eating Attitudesin Children,'' will be published in September's issue ofPediatrics, a monthly professional journal.   Researchers at the hospital surveyed girls and boys in the thirdthrough sixth grades at two randomly hosen schools in middle-incomeCincinnati-area neighborhoods.   Of those surveyed, the researchers said 45 percent indicatedthey were uncomfortable with their bodies and wanted to be thinner.Thirty-seven percent said they had already tried to lose weight,Maloney said.   ``Girls in grades five and six reported significantly morediscomfort about their bodies than girls in grades three and fouror boys in all grades,'' he said.   A total of 6.9 percent gave responses similar to those obtainedin studies of teen-agers and young adult females who suffer fromanorexia nervosa, a condition characterized by severe and prolongedinability or refusal to eat, he said.   ``Previous research has determined that 70 percent of17-year-old girls think they're overweight, but only 20 to 30percent really are,'' he said.   The researchers plan a six-year followup study in hopes oflearning more about the possible causes of eating disorders andways to treat them.   Maloney planned to present his findings Thursday to the AmericanSociety for Pediatric Research in Washington.</TEXT></DOC>
