Nothing has been heard of the envoy since he left the RivieraHotel in Moslem west Beirut at 7.30 p.m. on Jan. 20, 1987, to meetwith the Shiite Moslem kidnappers of two Americans he was trying tofree.   In England, prayer vigils organized by the Church Army, theChurch of England's evangelical branch, were held Friday to markWaite's 1,000th day as a hostage.   ``I really do think that he is still alive,'' his mother, Lena,said. ``I feel he is. He would hate to be shut up like that, but Iam sure he will come through all right.''   Waite was on his fifth mission to Beirut when he disappeared. Hetold his tough Druse bodyguards he did not want them to escort himto the clandestine meeting at an undisclosed site.   Well informed sources said at the time that Waite was driven tothe home of a Shiite Moslem physician who had acted as ago-between. He was apparently to contact representatives of IslamicJihad, which holds U.S. hostages Terry Anderson and ThomasSutherland.   Waite never returned, and it is widely believed he became acaptive of the Iranian-backed Shiite Moslem extremists.   The 50-year-old envoy, a policeman's son who became the personalemissary of Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie, is one of fiveBritons missing in Lebanon.   Thirteen other Westerners, including eight Americans, aremissing. All Americans are believed held by Shiite factions.   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The AssociatedPress, has been held longer than any hostage. He was kidnappedMarch 16, 1985.   Several rumors about Waite's fate have circulated. He has beenreported ill, killed, wounded while trying to escape, smuggled toIran in a coffin to stand trial as an American spy, and ransomedfor $7 million.   No group has claimed to hold him and there have been nophotographs or videotapes to prove he is alive. The Britishgovernment says no demands have been made for his freedom.   But other Western hostages freed since Waite disappeared havereported seeing a man believed to be the towering 6-foot, 7-inchBriton in an underground prison.   Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt, who says he will pursue every leadto try to free Waite, has accused the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, orParty of God, of holding Waite.   Hezbollah, believed to be the umbrella for groups holding mostof the Westerners, denies the allegation.   Ten days after Waite vanished, Runcie said the envoy had leftwritten instructions that he wanted no ransom paid or rescuemission attempted if he was kidnapped during his mission.   Waite's disappearance came months after the disclosure that theUnited States had traded arms for hostages.   Three Americans held by Islamic Jihad were freed following thedelivery of U.S. weapons to Iran in 1985-86 during its war withIraq.   Waite had been credited with securing the release of the three _the Rev. Benjamin Weir, the Rev. Laurence Jenco, and David Jacobson_ until the U.S. dealings with Tehran were disclosed in November1986.   There have been reports Islamic Jihad decided to hold Waiteresponsible for failing to secure the freedom of 15 pro-Iranianextremists imprisoned in Kuwait for a string of 1983 bombings.Freeing those men had been Islamic Jihad's main demand.</TEXT></DOC>
