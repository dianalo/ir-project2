I just decided to throw caution to the wind andcome to America and go for it.&quot;;    Arriving virtually penniless and with fewcontacts, Mandylor spent 10 days sleeping on his suitcase on Santa MonicaBeach before he found a part-time job. Over the next several years he tookacting lessons and worked odd jobs as a caterer and furniture mover beforelanding a role with a &quot;really dodgy&quot; film in the Philippines.;    &quot;I thoughtit was a chance to make some money and see the Philippines,&quot; he recalls,grimacing at his naivete. &quot;The movie's never been seen and probably neverwill. I don't even remember what they called it.&quot;;    What he won't forget,however, are the bullets flying overhead as cast and crew were caught in acoup attempt against President Corazon Aquino.;    &quot;We thought we were goingto be hostages. We ended up getting shot at by government troops because therebels were on the roof,&quot; he says, chuckling at the absurdity of thesituation.;    &quot;It was pretty wild. They finally got us out of there. Theyended up shooting at each other for three days. We had to be locked up in ahotel room for a few days drinking whiskey just to calm down. It was quite anexperience. Eventually they let us out, and we finished the shoot.&quot;;   Mandylor and company are involved in a fair amount of gunplay themselves(albeit with blanks) in &quot;Mobsters,&quot; which recounts, more or less, the rise ofLucky Luciano (Slater), Meyer Lansky (Dempsey), Bugsy Siegel (Grieco), andFrank Costello (Mandylor) from the streets of New York's Lower East Side tothe board room of one of the nation's best organized crime syndicates.;    Notonly was Mandylor, whose character was nicknamed the &quot;The Prime Minister&quot;because of his diplomatic skills and political connections, not intimidated byworking with actors much more experienced than himself, but felt he had theinside track because of his uncommon upbringing.;    &quot;I grew up in areasonably heavy family. They owned nightclubs in Melbourne back in the '70sand early '80s. Heavy joints. From 13 years old I was washing dishes in theback room and saw a lot of things,&quot; he explains in his husky, Aussie accentedvoice. &quot;As I grew up I worked the doors of night clubs. I mixed with someheavy-duty men and I was sort of the baby of the group so some of them took meunder their wings.;    &quot;I know everything about mobsters there is to know.Before I became an actor these guys intrigued me so I've known about certainpeople beforehand.&quot;;    Not counting the Philippine fiasco, Mandylor made hisfeature debut with Willem Dafoe in the Holocaust story &quot;Triumph of theSpirit.&quot; Moviegoers with a practiced eye for talent also might recall Mandylorfrom the cameo roles he filled in two films: Oliver Stone's &quot;The Doors,&quot; wherehe plays an Italian count, and &quot;Soapdish,&quot; as a wannabe actor hired bylibidinous casting director Carrie Fisher.;    The actor was initially set toplay the more high-profile Siegel role but was bumped in favor of thebetter-known Grieco (at Universal's insistence) after the movie switchedstudios and its first director Luis Mandoki was replaced by MichaelKarbelnikoff.;    You'd think an experience like that would make an actorbitter, but Mandylor is just overwhelmed that anyone would even consider himfor a major movie role.;    Take, for example, the actor's recent experienceauditioning for a part in Francis Ford Coppola's next movie -- a role whichultimately went to Gary Oldman.;    &quot;It was like history meeting you. It's asurprise I'm even there. It made me realize yet again I am an actor. I am inthis business. Sometimes it just catches me by surprise,&quot; he confides.;   That experience almost topped his first encounter on the &quot;Mobsters&quot; set withlongtime idol Anthony Quinn, who plays Mafia boss Don Masseria.;    &quot;Withoutgetting too precious, he was kind of like a second father figure after I sawhim in 'Zorba the Greek,' &quot; says Mandylor, who has lived in Greece and stillvisits relatives there. &quot;The first day I was looking for my trailer -- theydidn't have the names up on them yet -- I ran into a trailer and there wasAnthony Quinn standing there. I kind of got a little shock. He was very warm,we had a little laugh, instinctively I just grabbed him and gave him a hug. Itwas fantastic.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Entertainment News Wire  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Los Angeles  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910807  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  August  </MONTH><PG.COL>  5F  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  908  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday August 7, 199100220179,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
