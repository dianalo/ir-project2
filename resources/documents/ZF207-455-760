Ady III,resource management director for the Office of the Secretary of Defense forTrade Security Policy.andP;  &quot;There's no question that additional pay is needed.&quot;andM;But better pay probably will do little for recruiting, said John P. Kratzke,associate director for policy in the Agriculture Department's IRM Office.andM;&quot;I just don't know how many people come from industry&quot; into the SeniorExecutive Service, he said.andM;Statistics from the General Accounting Office, Congress and other groups showthe turnover rate of SES employees on the rise, with more than half of thecurrent SES employees eligible for retirement expected to take it by nextyear.andM;In 1988, 60 percent of SES employees told GAO they would not recommendfederal employment.andM;Better pay for federal IRM and ADP employees, who earn 25 percent to 50percent less than their industry counterparts, would be an incentive to stay,Kratzke said.andP;  But the bigger problem, he said, is &quot;the erroneous perception[that] the federal government is full of hacks.&quot;andM;No Overnight SolutionandM;&quot;It's not the type of situation that's going to be solved overnight,&quot; Kratzkesaid.andP;  During the negotiations over the proposal, the administration andmembers of Congress must avoid &quot;fed bashing,&quot; he added.andM;In introducing his proposal early this month, Bush said improving themotivation and morale of federal employees is essential.andM;Bush wants agencies to pay higher salaries, not greater than top ExecutiveSchedule wage, to top federal employees in critical specialized positions,such as medical research and computer science.andM;For most SES employees, the proposal asked for increases ranging from 8percent to 25 percent.andM;The cap for Level 1 ES employees would go from $99,500 to $124,400, while thecap for SES ES-6 employees would rise from $80,700 to $100,900.andM;The legislation also would tie pay raises to performance ratings every threeyears.andM;Poor pay has affected Bush's ability to fill some high department posts too,the White House press office said.andP;  &quot;Failure to provide competitive pay isimpeding recruitment and retention of the most qualified persons at thesenior levels of government,&quot; a White House fact sheet said.andM;An Equitable SystemandM;Though immediate and big raises are needed to close the industry-governmentpay gap, Ady said, the administration and Congress need to find an &quot;equitablesystem for regular and incremental pay raises.&quot;andM;Pay has become too politicized and crisis-oriented, he said, suggesting thecreation of an independent Government Employee Pay Commission to handlesalary recommendations.andP;  Ady also said congressional, judicial and employeepay should be set separately, not lumped together.andM;If approved by Congress, the Bush pay proposals would take effect Jan. 1.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
