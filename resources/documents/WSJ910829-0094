The agreement calls for ATandamp;T to provide Nippondenso withits smart cards, a tiny computing device which looks like acredit card and can store and retrieve information.Nippondenso will distribute the cards and manufactureexclusively ATandamp;T-designed terminals, called &quot;reader/writers,&quot;that make the cards work.</LP><TEXT>   While the two companies will initially concentrate theirmanufacturing and marketing efforts in Japan, analysts saidthe combination of the U.S. telecommunications giant andJapan's largest automobile manufacturer could become aformidable competitor in the nascent smart-card industry.   &quot;They have the potential for being a major force in theworld market,&quot; said Jerome Svigals, president of JeromeSvigals Inc., a Redwood City, Calif., research firm thatfollows the smart-card market. He said the smart-cardbusiness is currently a $660 million industry growing 30% ayear.   ATandamp;T said the partnership is exploring using the cards fornumerous applications including personal identification andsecurity, automotive service and roadside guidance systems.Such cards are already being used in the U.S., Japan andEurope to provide everything from automatic toll collectionto a U.K. satellite television service that allows a customerto use his card to order a TV program and be automaticallybilled.   The financial terms of the agreement weren't disclosed,and ATandamp;T wouldn't say how much it expects to sell withNippondenso's help. But ATandamp;T said Nippondenso has estimatedthat its smart-card business will have revenue of 10 billionyen ($73 million) within five years.   Nippondenso, an automotive parts manufacturer with annualrevenue of about $10 billion, is the second-largest companyin Toyota Motor Corp.'s family of suppliers. Nippondenso alsobuilds magnetic card readers for financial, security, andpoint-of-sale terminals.   &quot;This is a fairly major arrangement for us,&quot; said DianeWetherington, president, ATandamp;T Smart Cards. &quot;The Japanese seethis as an enormous business. Just about every major Japanesecompany is participating in the market.&quot; She added thatlarge-scale distribution in Japan may enable ATandamp;T topenetrate smart-card programs planned in other countries byautomotive companies that are currently Nippondenso'scustomers, including Daimler Benz and Ford Motor Co.</TEXT></DOC>
