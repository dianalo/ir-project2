Timbers, chief investment officer at Kemper Financial Services Inc., Chicago. As U.S. budget and trade deficits have made the nation increasingly dependent on foreign capital, &quot;It's hard to see anything but higher rates here when they are rising in Japan and West Germany.&quot;    Investor fear of rising rates here and overseas roiled the stock market, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted a record 91.55 points to 2548.63. Prices of actively traded 30-year government bonds rose more than a quarter-point, or $2.50 for each $1,000 face amount. Prices of most corporate and municipal bonds edged lower.    &quot;Pressure is definitely building for an increase in the prime,&quot; or base rate on corporate loans, said Steven A. Wood, a bond market analyst at Bank of America, San Francisco. &quot;We usually see an increase&quot; when the prime, now 8 3/4%, is less than a percentage point more than interest rates on 90-day bank certificates of deposit, currently about 8.05%. &quot;I don't see anything to snap the bond market out of a bearish mood,&quot; Mr. Wood added.    &quot;The simple fact is that our (credit) market isn't that attractive relative to other major government bond markets,&quot; said E. Craig Coats Jr., a managing director at Salomon Brothers Inc. &quot;Current yield levels are terrific, but we haven't seen any&quot; investor interest, he added, predicting that yields on long-term government bonds could rise to &quot;10% or 10 1/2% during the next few weeks.&quot;    Interest rates &quot;probably are going up some more,&quot; said J. Dewey Daane, a Federal Reserve governor from 1963 to 1974 and now a professor of banking at Vanderbilt University's Owen Graduate School of Management. &quot;We probably are getting ourselves back into more inflation,&quot; said Mr. Daane.    Mr. Daane is very skeptical of administration claims of progress on cutting the budget deficit. &quot;All this talk about a definite improvement on the budget front is nothing more than a snare and a delusion,&quot; he contended.    Whatever the case, some analysts were urging clients to sell stocks and park their funds temporarily in such havens as short-term government securities. Early yesterday, even before the stock market plunge began, Roger Brinner, chief economist of Data Resources, said in a speech that stock prices &quot;are irrationally high, given bond yields and earnings prospects.&quot;    &quot;This appears to be a good time to shift out of stocks into short-term instruments and then on a phase-in basis into bonds,&quot; Mr. Brinner said at a meeting with clients.    Mr. Brinner, who also is a trustee of Kalamazoo College in Michigan, said he recently helped persuade the college &quot;to pull a big fraction of its money out of stocks and move into fixed-income, initially into a money market fund, and later roll it into the bond market.&quot;    In the Treasury bond market, where the government auctioned $7.29 billion of four-year notes yesterday and plans to auction $6.75 billion of seven-year notes today, securities dealers are worried that they could &quot;wind up holding the bulk of these notes,&quot; said Mr. Coats of Salomon Brothers.    In yesterday's sale, the four-year notes were auctioned at an average yield of 9.24%, up from 7.89% at the previous sale of four-year notes June 24 and the highest since 9.47% on Oct. 29, 1985. Before the auction, traders apparently sold borrowed securities with the aim of buying them back at lower prices -- a tactic that often occurs when investor demand for new securities is considered light. Such &quot;short-covering,&quot; or buying securities back, helped trigger a late rally in the government sector.    The fear of rising U.S. interest rates stems partly from tighter credit in Japan and West Germany, whose investment markets compete with the U.S. bond market for investors.    Yesterday, for example, the West German central bank said it is encouraging slightly higher rates on money market instruments to control torrid money supply growth the past several months. The Bank of Japan announced a similar move recently to curb money supply and inflation pressures.    Since Aug. 24, the gap between yields on 10-year U.S. and Japanese government notes has narrowed to about 3.7 percentage points from about 4.25 percentage points as both markets slumped, according to Salomon Brothers. As recently as May, U.S. issues yielded about six percentage points more than Japanese issues.    &quot;Foreigners have less of an appetite for our bonds, and that's exerting some upward pressure on rates,&quot; said Mr. Timbers of Kemper Financial, which manages about $46 billion for investors. Mr. Wood of Bank of America said: &quot;What's significant now is that monetary authorities in the U.S., Japan and West Germany have all signaled a tighter posture on credit.&quot;    Despite relatively high bond yields and a stable dollar recently, many investors still worry that any significant weakening in the dollar will drive bond yields sharply higher. Martin S. Feldstein, a former chairman of President Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers, said yesterday he expects the dollar to drop &quot;about 30% over the next five years&quot; against other major currencies.    Speaking at the Data Resources meeting here, Mr. Feldstein, president of the National Bureau of Economic Research as well as a senior economic adviser to Data Resources, also said he expects further increases in both inflation and bond yields.    Nevertheless, Mr. Feldstein contended that inflation will remain &quot;moderate&quot; and that long-term bond yields &quot;won't rise very substantially.&quot; He added, &quot;I would be surprised if we saw an additional increase of 100 basis points,&quot; which is one percentage point, in long-term bond yields. He also predicted continued economic expansion at least through 1988.    In the bond market yesterday, the Treasury's 8 7/8% bonds due 2017 rose to 91 12/32 from 91 2/32 Monday. The yield declined slightly to 9.77% from 9.80%. The government's 8 5/8% notes due 1997 rose to 93 12/32 from 93 1/4, as the yield fell to 9.68% from 9.7%.    Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury bonds rose 1.59 points to 1171.01. It finished the day just below its highest level of the session, which was 1171.71. The low was 1163.64.    The Treasury's seven-year notes to be auctioned today were quoted late yesterday at 9.54%, down slightly from 9.57% late Monday.    Interest rates were mixed on short-term Treasury bills. The latest three-month bill rate climbed to 6.52% bid from an average rate of 6.49% at Monday's auction. But the rate on new six-month bills declined to 6.92% bid from Monday's auction average of 6.96%.    The federal funds rate edged lower. The rate on funds, or reserves that banks lend each other overnight, averaged 7.34%, according to an estimate by Fulton Prebon (U.S.A.) Inc. That was down from 7.45% Monday.    The municipal market was dominated by a huge two-part offering by the New York State Medical Care Facilities Finance Agency, totaling more than $710 million of mental health services facilities improvement bonds. Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. headed the underwriting group for both issues.    One part consists of about $393.6 million of revenue bonds. Under the tentative terms announced yesterday, yields range from 6.25% on bonds due 1989 to 8.99% on bonds due 2007. The other part consists of about $316.7 million of special obligation bonds, with yields ranging from 5.25% on bonds due 1988 to 8.5% on bonds due 2006 and 2007.    Despite the decline in municipal bond prices yesterday, the New York offering &quot;was reasonably well-received,&quot; said Frank Scaraggi, an executive vice president in the municipal bond department at Shearson Lehman. &quot;These issues were fairly priced, and a 9% yield is beginning to turn people on.&quot;    Here are the details of yesterday's auction of four-year Treasury notes:    Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it.
