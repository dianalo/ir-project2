the company says that further source and target languages can beadded simply be defining a knowledge base for translation, and the system,which runs on a workstation, is claimed to to translate at a rate of 15 A4pages an hour; NEC is looking to have the thing on the market commercially inabout four years' time.andM;Hitachi Ltd is suing Motorola Inc in the US alleging patent infringement ofHitachi's 8-bit devices, and the battle between the former partners - Hitachiwas the official second source for the 6800, 6809 and 68000 families butnever got 68020 masks - is getting more and more bitter: Nippon Motorola hasnow responded to Hitachi's suit alleging that the Motorola MC68HC11 familyinfringes Hitachi patents with a counter-suit that contends that the Motorolapart does not infringe Hitachi's Japanese patent because at least other twofirms have lodged a protest over the patent at the Patent Office, which meansthat Hitachi's patent is not yet ratified.andM;Citizen Watch Co is very proud of what it claims is the world's thinnest - at0.75&quot; - 3.5&quot; battery-driven floppy disk drive, called the U0 series andannounced in the US and Europe as well as in Japan: the thing is also claimedto be the shallowest floppy disk yet at 5.1&quot;, and light at 11.3 oz; there aretwo models, the UODC sporting track-to-track access time and UODD with 6mStrack-to-track; samples of each are about $1,500 - sounds high - and Citizenis planning to make 200,000 of them a month; the ultra-thinness is achieved aside-swing carriage mechanism, a belt drive and a metal frame; Citizen seesthe things turning up in note-book sized personel computers and pocket wordprocessors.andM;Canon Inc has come out with a Japanese language desk-top publishing system,the Canon Word Processor 1000s, which has 40Mb of hard disk and can beconnected via a local area network connection kit to create an Ethernetnetwork for the sharing of documents, tables and images: the basic system is$20,000, plus $2,900 for the local net interface kit, and $3,900 for the 40MbWinchester; Canon plans to make an undemanding 400 systems per year.andM;A Japanese version of the Dynafile floppy has been developed to enable AppleComputer Inc Macs to read files created on the top-selling NEC Corp 9801personal family; it is $1,235.andM;IBM Japan has brought out commercial versions of software to assist in thedevelopment of expert systems: the operations support packages includes aGeneral Scheduling Kernel/KT for computer scheduling applications, anAutomatic System Network Operation tool, both for 370-type mainframes, and anAS/400 Knowledge Tool for adding artificial functions to applications runningon the AS/400; there is also XPT-II for VM systems; Kernal/KT was developedwith Nippon Kokan KK and the Network Operation tool with Sumitomo Metals.andM;Seiko Epson Co is to begin volume production of 1M-bit static RAMs on a newproduction line at its plant at Fujimi from the autumn: Hitachi Ltd andToshiba Corp pioneered the 1M generation of static, but are now pouring alltheir resources into 4M memory chips, leaving a niche for Epson, the companyhopes; sample 1M statics were offered by Hitachi at $460 last October, and itplans to do 5,000 a month from this month, and Toshiba is at a similarposition in the production cycle - but both companies are more exercised atwinning leadership position in 4M dynamics.andM;Lotus Development Japan has begun marketing its One Source compact diskfinancial databases in Japan, thus providing Japanese users with US corporateinformation: the database also includes some data on Japanese comapnies,obtained from the Princeton, New Jersey-based Center for InternationalFinancial Research; disks are issued weekly on a subscription basis at $9,230to $26,150 a year.andM;Apple Computer Japan has poached Shigechika Takeuchi, formerly senirovice-president at Toshiba Europe, to head its local operations, and ApplePacific chief Delbert Yocam described the appointment as an earnest of itsintention to make Apple Computer Japan &quot;a truly Japanese company&quot;: thesubsidiary is looking for sales in excess of $500m a year by 1993, and isconsidering development of some Japan-specific projects such as aJapanese-language desktop publishing system, it is reported.andM;A report on the market for magneto-optical disk drives in Japan, prepared bySeed Planning and quoted in the Nikkei Sangyoo Shimbun, says that a 3.5&quot;commercial product will be available next year, and will begin to replacemagnetic tape in 1991: the guess is that 3.5&quot; drives will be used in laptops,while 5.25&quot; drives will be used mainly for image databases; the forecastersexpect average access times to come down to 6mS to 8mS and prices of dirvesto below $2,000; the drive market for all types of optical drive was wortharound $83m last year and is forecast to triple to $192m by next year.andM;X/Open Group Ltd opened its Japanese office for business at the beginning ofthis month: it currently has three local members, Fujitsu Ltd, Hitachi LtdandNEC Corp: top priority is to translate the specs in the Portability Guideinto Japanese, and to liaise with the European and US X/Open offices.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
