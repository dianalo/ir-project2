<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-73-0629 </DOCNO><TEXT>We continue our study of Bell's inequalities and quantum field theory.It is shown in considerably broader generality than in our previous workthat algebras of local observables corresponding to complementary wedgeregions maximally violate Bell's inequality in all normal states. Pairsof commuting von Neumann algebras that maximally violate Bell's inequalitiesin all normal states are characterized. Algebras of local observablescorresponding to tangent double cones are shown to maximally violateBell's inequalities in all normal states in dilatation-invariant theories,in free quantum field models, and in a class of interacting models. Further,it is proven that such algebras are not split in any theory with an ultravioletscaling limit.</TEXT></DOC>
