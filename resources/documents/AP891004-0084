Jesse Helms, R-N.C., saidTuesday.   Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., said U.S. intervention couldhave made a difference in the attempted coup against Gen. ManuelAntonio Noriega.   ``We have the absolute unilateral right to use force,''DeConcini said.   But Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., said of the complaints: ``It'svery easy to be an armchair general.''   ``The president finally has to think about our treatyobligations, our personnel, our relations with other countries inthe Latin American hemisphere and the future of democracy inPanama, which can flow only from the Panamanian people makingchoices,'' he said today on the NBC ``Today'' program.   Although the U.S. military forces in Panama were on alert,American officials said they only observed the fighting Tuesdaybetween members of the Panama Defense forces, standing by to helpany Americans who might be in danger.   Lugar, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, urgedcontinued economic and diplomatic pressure on Panama, saying thecoup attempt indicated growing discontent inside that country withNoriega.   ``I have no doubt that there are going to be further attempts,there is going to be further pressure. This is not over by a longshot,'' he said. ``We have only that choice _ to let things taketheir course.''   Rep. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., also urged continued economicpressure without force.   ``To simply send in troops is not how democracy should berestored in Panama,'' Torricelli, a member of the House ForeignAffairs Committee, said on ABC's ``Good Morning America'' program.``It will happen and will be done the right way without causing abacklash against the United States.''   Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman David Boren, D-Okla., wasbitter after emerging from an hour-long classified CIA briefingTuesday on the coup attempt.   ``Here you have brave people in Panama ... trying to ridthemselves of a drug dealer and a thug who's taken over theircountry,'' Boren said.   ``And for the United States, with all of our strength and forceand all of our belief in democracy, to stand by ... and do nothingand allow these people to fail, personally I think is wrong.''   Boren said he had been notified early Tuesday that the coup wasin progress and followed its progress throughout the day. He said200 to 300 rebel troops had seized the Panamanian Defense Forcesheadquarters compound with Noriega inside, and had the leader``trapped and pinned down.''   But later in the day, about 500 troops loyal to Noriegasurrounded the compound and freed him. The fate of those who ledthe revolt was unclear.   No American troops or citizens were involved, Boren said.   ``I'm just sorry it didn't succeed. I'm sorry there was not someway, apparently, for the United States to help make it succeed,''Boren told reporters.   He cited failures by the Reagan administration to use force tohelp Eric Arturo Delvalle when he sought to remove Noriega frompower, and to help maintain order when Noriega later overrodenational elections to retain power for himself.   Asked whether military force should have been used Tuesday,Boren said:   ``My personal view is that we should have, and we didn't. ... Wecertainly knew at that moment where (Noriega) was. He was in aphysical location where perhaps he could have been served with thatwarrant for his arrest.''   Noriega has been indicted in the United States on drug charges.   ``I think it's one thing for the United States to go into anyother country ... and try to impose its will from the outside,''Boren said.   ``It's quite another thing when the people of Panama have veryclearly spoken in their free elections, and overwhelmingly want torid themselves of this ... corrupt dictatorship. ... I don't thinkit is improper at all for the United States then to offer a helpinghand to the Panamanian people.''</TEXT></DOC>
