Background</ITAG>Section 1424(e) of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C., 300f, 300h-3(e),Pub. L. 93-523) states:<ITAG tagnum="21">``(e) If the Administrator determines on his own initiative or uponpetition, that an area has an aquifer which is the sole or principal drinkingwater source for the area and which, if contaminated, would create a significanthazard to public health, he shall publish notice of that determinationin the <T4>Federal Register.</T4> After the publication of any such notice, nocommitment for Federal financial assistance (through a grant, contract,loan guarantee, or otherwise) may be entered into for any project whichthe Administrator determines may contaminate such aquifer through a rechargezone so as to create a significant hazard to public health, but a commitmentfor Federal financial assistance may, if authorized under another provisionof law, be entered into to plan or design the project to assure that itwill not so contaminate the aquifer.''</ITAG>Effective March 9, 1987, authority to make a Sole Source Aquifer (SSA)Designation Determination was delegated to the U.S. EPA Regional Administrators.On March 10, 1988, EPA received a complete SSA petition from the Ohio-Kentucky-IndianaRegional Council of Governments of Cincinnati, Ohio, which petitioned EPAto designate the BVAS-South as a Sole Source Aquifer.On April 20, 1988, EPA published notice to announce a public comment periodregarding the petition. The public was invited to submit comments and informationon the petition until June 3, 1988. A public meeting was held on May 18,1988, at the EPA Research facility in Cincinnati. Comments were acceptedfor 16 days following the meeting.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Basis for Determination</ITAG>Among the factors to be considered by the U.S. EPA in connection with thedesignation of an area under Section 1424(e) are: (1) Whether the BVAS-Southis the area's sole or principal source of drinking water, and (2) whethercontamination of the aquifer would create a significant hazard to publichealth. On the basis of technical information available to this Agency,the Regional Administrator has made the following findings, which are thebases for the determination noted above:1. The BVAS-South currently serves as the ``sole source'' of drinking waterfor approximately 650,000 residents, of Butler, Warren, Hamilton, Clermontand Clinton Counties.2. There is no existing alternative drinking water source or combinationof sources which provides 50 percent or more of the drinking water to thedesignated area, nor is there any available, cost-effective potential sourcecapable of replacing the drinking water needs of the communities and individualsthat presently rely on the aquifer.3. The Buried Valley Aquifer System-South is an unconfined to semiconfinedaquifer system that transmits water through unconsolidated glacial sediments.The high porosity and permeability of these deposits, coupled with thinoverlying soils and shallow depth of water, make the BVAS-South very vulnerableto contamination. Contamination has already occurred, in Hamilton, Butler,Warren, and Clermont Counties. Sources for contamination include, but arenot limited to: (A) Leaking underground storage tanks, (B) stormwater drainsthat discharge to ground water, (C) accidental release of hazardous materials,(D) use and improper storage of agricultural chemicals, (E) salting ofroads for ice control, and (F) poorly functioning on-site waste water disposalsystems. Should any of the above sources of contamination enter the publicwater supply, there could be a significant negative effect on drinkingwater quality, with a consequent adverse effect on public health.<ITAG tagnum="85">III. Description of the Buried Valley Aquifer System: Hydrogeology;Use; Recharge; Boundaries</ITAG>The entire BVAS of the Great Miami/Little Miami River Basins was formedwhen successive glacial events discharged sediment-choked meltwaters throughpre-existing bedrock valleys. These meltwaters left behind heterogeneousdeposits of gravel, sand, silt, and clay. The gravel and sand depositsform the principal aquifers of the BVAS, and range in thickness from 20to 400 feet, and in width from \1/10\th to 3 miles. The Ohio Departmentof Natural Resources subdivides the BVAS into Class I and Class II aquifers,based on hydrogeologic characteristics.Ground water withdrawal from public and private water supply wells in theBVAS-South averages approximately 74 million gallons per day (mg/d) withinthe proposed area. This resource is so readily available and prolific thatfew communities and individuals within reach of it have developed alternativesources, with the exception of much of the Cincinnati Metropolitan Area,which relies on water from the Ohio River. In fact, 73 percent of the publicwater and 100 percent of the private water in the proposed designated areais drawn from the BVAS-South.The BVAS-South is recharged primarily by precipitation, with a minor amountcontributed as inflow from the upland areas. Some of the public supplywellfields produce sufficient drawdown to cause induced recharge from surfacewater bodies to be the primary recharge to the wellfield. However, accordingto a USGS report on the aquifer system, ``The flow [in the rivers] thatis equaled or exceeded 90 percent of the time * * * is generally consideredto come primarily from ground water.'' In other words, ground water contributesthe bulk of water to rivers in the area. So the primary recharge mechanismultimately remains the infiltration of precipitation over the aquifer,and the recharge area boundaries are coincident with the aquifer systemboundaries.The project review area consists of the area over the Class I and II aquiferssouth a hydrodynamic boundary which occurs just south of the City of Franklinin Warren County, to the southern boundary of the Great Miami Basin andincluding that portion of the BVAS in the Little Miami Basin in Warren,Clermont, and Clinton Counties. Included are two small ``fingers'' of aquiferin western Preble County that connect with the main aquifer in the BVAS-Southarea.The designated area does not include the Mill Creek Basin in Butler andHamilton Counties. This basin contains a Class I aquifer, but the populationin the drainage basin depends primarily on surface water for their drinkingwater supply. Although the communities of Wyoming, Lockland, Glendale,and Reading do use ground water as their water source, they can connectto the Cincinnati water system if the aquifer becomes contaminated beyondlevels commensurate with public health. When considered as a separate hydrologicsystem, the Mill Creek Basin does not meet the criteria established byEPA for sole source eligibility. Also excluded is a portion of the OhioRiver in southwest Butler County, just upstream from the confluence ofthe Ohio with the Great Miami River. This designation includes no partof the Ohio River Aquifer.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Alternative Sources</ITAG>The Petitioner considered two alternatives to the BVAS-South to supplydrinking water; existing surface water systems and bedrock aquifers.Bedrock aquifers do not have the characteristics necessary to enable themto transmit sufficient water to replace the amount currently supplied bythe aquifer. In addition, the water is highly mineralized, requiring additionaltreatment to bring it up to the quality of the current supply. Thousandsof new wells would have to be drilled, and additional piping installedfor public water supplies. Private users would have the expense eitherof hooking up to public water, deepening their existing wells, or redrilling.The City of Cincinnati public water system draws heavily on Ohio Riverwater, using over 27 million gallons per day. Additional river water, aswell as water from two reservoirs in Warren and Clermont Counties, couldbe supplied to nearby, ground water-dependent systems. However, many watersystems, are not within a distance that is normal for the area to transportwater. Under the EPA Sole Source Aquifer Guidance, for a potential sourceto be considered as viable, it must be ``near'' in terms of what is normalfor the area. Also, in many cases where the potential source is near, theinfrastructure necessary to transfer to that source must be constructed,which would send annual costs to users over the economic thresholds ofthe guidance.The potential alternative water sources considered in the petition couldnot replace the increment supplied by the BVAS-South if it should becomewidely contaminated. Therefore, from the standpoint of use, the BVAS-South,excluding the Mill Creek Basin Aquifer, meets the criteria of a sole orprincipal source aquifer.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Information Utilized in Determination</ITAG>The information utilized in this determination includes the petition, publishedState and Federal reports on the area, and various technical publications.The petition file is available to the public and may be inspected duringnormal business hours at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, RegionV, Office of Ground Water, 111 W. Jackson, 10th Floor, Chicago, Illinois60604.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Project Review</ITAG>EPA Region V is working with the Federal agencies that may in the futureprovide financial assistance to projects in the area of concern. Interagencyprocedures and Memoranda of Understanding will be developed through whichEPA will be notified of proposed commitments of funding by Federal agenciesfor projects which could contaminate the designated area of the BuriedValley Aquifer System. EPA will evaluate such projects and, where necessary,conduct an in-depth review, including solicitation of public comments whereappropriate. Should the Administrator determine that a project may contaminatethe aquifer through its recharge zone so as to create a significant hazardto public health, no commitment for Federal financial assistance may bemade. However, a commitment for Federal financial assistance may, if authorizedunder another provision of law, be made to plan or design the project toassure that it will not contaminate the aquifer.Although the project review process cannot be delegated, the U.S. EnvironmentalProtection Agency will rely to the maximum extent possible on existingor future State and local control mechanisms in protecting the ground waterquality of the BVAS. Included in the review of any Federal financiallyassisted project will be coordination with State and local agencies. Theircomments will be given full consideration, and the Federal review processwill attempt to complement and support State and local ground water protectionmechanisms.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Summary of Public Comments</ITAG>The City of Oxford, Ohio, requested that a portion of Class II Aquiferwithin its boundaries be excluded because there are no wells in it thatcould be impacted by contamination. Because there is no hydrogeologic reasonto exclude this portion, EPA will include it in the designated area. However,the absence of drinking water wells will be a factor to consider in futurereviews when determining whether contamination from a project would createa hazard to public health.During a public meeting on May 18, 1988, the question arose as to whetherthe Mill Creek Basin (MCB) Aquifer should be included in the designatedarea. When considered as a separate hydrologic system, the MCB aquifersupplies only about 20 percent of the drinking water, with the majorityof the population on surface water from the Cincinnati System. The areais highly industrialized, and a substantial portion of the recharge areais already occluded by development. The Mill Creek itself is heavily channelizedand, in many stretches, enclosed in a cement channel which prevents itfrom gaining flow in those stretches from ground water. Proponents forinclusion of the MCB Aquifer maintained that to exclude it from the designatedarea would disrupt the integrity of the BVAS Sole Source Aquifer and haveadverse impacts on the water supply of those communities that do use theMCB Aquifer for their water supply. In a written comment, the Greater Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce opposeddesignation of the entire proposed area on the strength of the amount ofsurface water used by Cincinnati. However, the entire surface-water dependentarea need not be included in the Aquifer Service Area, and the Chambersubmitted no data to support its claim. The data supplied in the petitionis based on U.S. Census figures and field work, and in the absence of datato support the Chamber's position, EPA is accepting the demographic andwater use data of the petition.Cincinnati Gas and Electric Company requested that a portion of the proposeddesignated area that includes the Ohio River Aquifer in southwest ButlerCounty be excluded from the final designation. Analysis of geologic datasuggests that the area in question is separate and upgradient from theGreat Miami aquifer and, therefore, will <T3>not </T3>be part of the final designated area.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Economic and Regulatory Impact</ITAG>Under the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C.605(b), I hereby certify that the attached rule will not have a significantimpact on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of thisCertification, the ``small entity'' shall have the same meaning as givenin section 601 of the RFA. This action is only applicable to the designatedarea of the Buried Valley Aquifer System-South. The only affected entitieswill be those area-based businesses, organizations, or governmental jurisdictionsthat request Federal financial assistance for projects which have the potentialto contaminate the aquifer so as to create a significant hazard to publichealth. EPA does not expect to be reviewing small isolated commitmentsof financial assistance on an individual basis, unless a cumulative impacton the aquifer is anticipated; accordingly, the number of affected smallentities will be minimal.For those small entities which are subject to review, the impact of today'saction will not be significant. Most projects subject to this review willbe preceded by a ground water impact assessment required under other Federallaws, such as the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) as amended,42 U.S.C. 4321, <T3>et seq</T3>. Integration of those related review procedures with SoleSource Aquifer review will allow EPA and other Federal agencies to avoiddelay or duplication of effort in approving financial assistance, thusminimizing any adverse effect on those small entities which are affected.Finally, today's action does not prevent grants of Federal financial assistancewhich may be available to any affected small entity in order to pay forthe redesign of the project to assure protection of the aquifer. Under Executive Order 12291, EPA must judge whether a regulation is ``major''and, therefore, subject to the requirement of a Regulatory Impact Analysis.This regulation is not major because it will not have an annual effectof $100 million or more on the economy, will not cause any major increasein costs or prices, and will not have significant adverse effects on competition,employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or the ability of UnitedStates enterprises to compete in domestic or export markets. Today's actiononly provides for an in-depth review of ground water protection measures,incorporating State and local measures whenever possible, for only theseprojects which request Federal financial assistance.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: June 17, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Valdas V.
