The 47-year-old Columbus businessman said he has notified theFranklin County Board of Elections that he is withdrawing from the12th District race. Gelpi, who was running as an independent, wonthe endorsement of the Democratic Party after it was learned thatMichael P. Brown, who ran unopposed in the Democratic primary, is asupporter of extremist Lyndon LaRouche.   Brown will face Republican U.S. Rep. John R. Kasich ofWesterville in the Nov. 8 election.   Shortly after a campaign appearance Sept. 14, Gelpi said he wentto the hospital after feeling severe chest pains. He underwentangioplasty, a procedure that uses a balloon to open cloggedarteries near the heart. One week later, he was again hospitalizedand again underwent angioplasty.   He said he feels healthy now, and will campaign on behalf of theDemocratic presidential ticket and U.S. Sen. Howard Metzenbuam, aDemocrat who is seeking re-election against Republican challengerGeorge Voinovich, mayor of Cleveland.   Gelpi said he took his doctors' advice to withdraw from therace, but he said his political future looks healthy.   ``We have a whole bunch of posters, bumper stickers and badgesleft, none of which say 1988 on them,'' he said, smiling. ``We'regoing to put them in storage.''   He said he has few regrets about his campaign, including hisacknowledgement of his sexual orientation. Gelpi said at the timehe wanted to make the issue public to avoid making it a major issuein the campaign and to allow him to concentrate on other subjects,such as health care and housing.   ``You know, people really didn't care. They wanted to know whereI stood on the issues,'' he said. ``I'm pro-choice, I'mpro-teacher. They could have found 14 other reasons not to vote forme other than I'm gay.''</TEXT></DOC>
