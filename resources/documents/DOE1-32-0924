Using a recording cone penetrometer it is shownthat (a) the simple 'single row' placing technique of placing soil resultsin less compaction than more complex operation procedures involving turningon to and off soil layers; (b) deep ripping on completion of soilingleads to less compact lower horizons than conventional sequential rippingof individual soil layers. The application of these findings will leadto economy in operations and to the required standards of restorationbeing more readily achieved. 1 ref., 6 figs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
