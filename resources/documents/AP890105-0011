L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit InsuranceCorp., which insures deposits in commercial banks, said Wednesdaythe insurance fund for Sandamp;Ls should be independent of the bank board.   The primary goal of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.,which insures deposits up to $100,000, is the safety and soundnessof savings institutions, he said.   However, the FSLIC's parent, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, isalso charged with creating, or chartering, Sandamp;Ls to provide a steadyflow of mortgage money to home buyers.   ``There's a basic conflict between those two roles and I thinkit's very important that they be separated so that the insurer ...can protect his insurance fund and not allow institutions thatoperate in an unsafe and unsound manner to have insurance,'' Seidmantold reporters at a luncheon to release a 408-page FDIC report,``Deposit Insurance for the Nineties: Meeting the Challenge.''   He recommended a regulatory structure for Sandamp;Ls similar to thesystem for banks. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, anarm of the Treasury Department, charters national banks, while theFDIC insures their deposits.   The U.S. League of Savings Institutions, the industry's largesttrade group, has not taken a position on separating the FSLIC fromthe bank board, but its chairman, B.R. Beeksma, said recently thequestion should be considered. The bank board's performance as achartering agency may be suffering because it is consumed with theproblems of the FSLIC, he said.   The FDIC, which prepared the report for Congress, alsorecommended placing Sandamp;L examiners under the FSLIC. Currently, theexaminers work for the regional Federal Home Loan Banks, which lendmoney to Sandamp;Ls, are owned by the industry and are controlled byboards composed of Sandamp;L executives.   The current system can have the effect of allowing Sandamp;Ls withrepresentatives on the regional bank boards to regulate theircompetitors, Seidman said.   The FDIC made no recommendation on how money should be raised topay for the Sandamp;L crisis, but said it was clear that the federalgovernment, rather than the Sandamp;L industry or banks, will have to paymost of the $60 billion to $115 billion needed to restore Sandamp;Ls tohealth.   But, it said, ``concerns about the federal budget deficit couldbe mitigated by an off-budget financing arrangement'' in which theTreasury pays the interest on borrowing to finance the industry'srescue.   The Treasury Department is preparing a recommendation forPresident-elect Bush and the new Congress.   Meanwhile, the FDIC rejected proposals to curtail or eliminatefederal deposit insurance, arguing that would increase the danger ofbank runs.   Some scholars say reducing or doing away with the insurance wouldforce depositors to pay more attention to how well theirinstitutions are run. The American Bankers Association said in astatement Wednesday that the current practice of protecting evendepositors with funds in excess of the $100,000 insurance limit``has become a license for abuse by some financial managers.''   But, Seidman said, ``In today's complex world, we think thedepositor, both sophisticated and unsophisticated, would have greatdifficulty in knowing the condition of their banks on a day-to-daybasis. ... We as bank regulators with thousands of supervisors havedifficulty in keeping control of banks in terms of their exactfinancial condition.''</TEXT></DOC>
