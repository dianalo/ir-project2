But in recent years, strange things have come to pass. Women have given their own family names to their children, and some couples have bequeathed hyphenated surnames to their offspring.    Now this: Parents are making use of little-known laws that allow them to bestow upon their children the surname of their choice. Short of a curse word or a series of numerals, the choice in most states is unlimited.    And so, in Pennsylvania, one set of parents gave their boy the surname &quot;Sue.&quot; A couple in North Carolina dignified their baby with a nine-page last name, although only what fits on one line appears on the birth certificate along with a note directing interested parties to the state's permanent records.    Some parents even pick different surnames for different children. For instance, Pierce Barker and Carol Frost, who moved recently from New Hampshire to Maryland, gave their firstborn the last name &quot;Roth-Tubman,&quot; in honor of author Philip Roth and abolitionist Harriet Tubman; their second child, the name &quot;Smith-Cook,&quot; after maternal and paternal ancestors; and their youngest, the name &quot;Woods,&quot; after the child's maternal great-great-grandmother.    This sort of new-fangled family doesn't sit well with some folks. Laurie Thompson, a genealogist who is often retained in inheritance disputes, says the thought of making up such a family tree makes her &quot;absolutely ill.&quot;    Lesley DuVall, a former Indiana state senator who sponsored legislation that now limits name choices in his state, worries about the impact on society. Free-form naming will result in everyone having &quot;different names at family reunions,&quot; he warns. &quot;What's that going to do for family cohesiveness, or doesn't that matter anymore?&quot;    But New Hampshire State Rep. Roger Stewart, who sponsored a laissez-faire names bill in behalf of Mr. Barker and Ms. Frost, sees the issue as one of freedom of choice. Although he admits his law &quot;louses up genealogy and schoolteachers and everything else,&quot; he says he sponsored the bill because &quot;this is New Hampshire, you know. 'Live Free or Die' is our motto.&quot;    For his part, Mr. Barker, a teacher himself, explains that he &quot;didn't particularly care&quot; for his last name. When their eldest son was born in 1974, he and his wife decided that Mr. Roth and Ms. Tubman were &quot;people we both admired and the names {together} sounded euphonious.&quot;    &quot;I know,&quot; he adds wryly. &quot;All right-thinking Americans give their kids the father's last name, right?&quot;    Only out of habit, insists Priscilla Ruth MacDougall, a labor attorney for the Wisconsin Education Council who has been involved in names cases for the past 15 years.    American common law, she explains, allows for complete freedom of choice when it comes to surnames. By 1968, she adds, only one state -- Hawaii -- had a statute limiting that choice.    &quot;Custom just operated so much that no one questioned&quot; what the law was, she says. But state laws and regulations came under closer scrutiny in the 1970s, as more and more women began keeping their own names after marriage and tried passing these or hyphenated surnames to their children.    Forced to confront the naming-rights issue for the first time, many states balked. North Carolina, Florida, Louisiana and New Hampshire passed laws specifying that a child born in wedlock bear the father's surname and one born out of wedlock bear the mother's, unless paternity was established and both parents requested in writing that the father's name be used.    Other states permitted more flexibility for children of married couples, allowing the mother's surname or a hyphenated surname as alternative choices. (In one case in Nebraska, though, the State Supreme Court ruled that the father's name had to come first.)    Where parents disagree over a surname, however, as is often the case with unmarried or divorcing couples, many states give the father veto power over the name choice, according to Ms. MacDougall.    Isabelle Penzler, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, acknowledges that while these restrictions have never touched off a public outcry, they become for people who covet the right to choose &quot;a burning issue. These people get real angry,&quot; she says.    Alena Jech and Adolf Befurt, a Hawaii couple, were among the first parents in America to get angry enough to take their case to court. They tried to register their son's last name as &quot;Jebef&quot; (a fusion of Jech and Befurt), but state health-department officials crossed it out on the child's birth certificate and replaced it with the father's name. After two years of unsuccessfully seeking a change, Ms. Jech and Mr. Befurt brought suit in 1979, claiming they had a constitutional right to name their child as they saw fit.    Federal courts in separate cases in Hawaii, North Carolina and Florida agreed. The existing state law &quot;impinges upon decisions affecting family life, procreation, and child rearing; areas of human experience which the Supreme Court has long held must be accorded special protection,&quot; ruled Federal Judge Robert R. Merhige Jr. in the North Carolina case in 1981.    The judge also dismissed the state's claim that an anything-goes naming policy would mess up its indexing system. As long as birth certificates bear the names chosen by parents, the judge wrote, parents don't care whether state registrars &quot;call their children A-1, A-2, and A-3, or Huey, Duey and Louey (sic).&quot;    New Jersey is the latest state to rewrite its regulations rather than risk being challenged in court. The change, effective next month, was prompted by a Mr. Greenberg and his wife, Ms. McBride, who wanted to name their baby &quot;Greenbride.&quot;    Indeed, the fused surname is the most popular alternative to passing along a family name, according to several state registrars. It best &quot;illustrates our relationship,&quot; says Christine Ledbetter, who, along with her husband, Dean Skylar, took the state of Florida to court to gain the right to name their son Sydney Anthony Skybetter.    &quot;We considered a hyphenated name, but the middle name always gets lost,&quot; she explains. Besides, she adds, &quot;the name is sort of neat. It's very '80s.&quot;    In another age, parents looking for unusual last names chose words like &quot;Sunshine&quot; or &quot;Peace,&quot; says John Reith, assistant director of the Department of Vital Records in New York state, recalling the late 1960s.    &quot;When we had the hippie culture -- that was a strong era for strange names,&quot; says David Mitchell, the California state registrar.    Ms. Ledbetter, who gave birth several weeks ago to her second child, Rachel Amelia Skybetter, isn't concerned about how her children will adapt to their name. Sydney, now 4 1/2, &quot;is doing wonderfully with it. He has his own telephone listing. And we wrote a little book to explain his name for him,&quot; she says.    She admits she is sometimes called &quot;Mrs. Skybetter,&quot; but says most people have gotten used to the situation. &quot;It's not unusual for kids from one-parent households to have last names different from their parents,&quot; she says.    But Teddy Roth-Tubman, now 12 years old, isn't so sure. Asked whether he likes having a last name that doesn't match his parents', he says, &quot;I guess so. It sure is a lot different than other kids.&quot;    Would he do the same with his children? &quot;I don't think so,&quot; he responds, after some thought. &quot;It's kind of peculiar.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
