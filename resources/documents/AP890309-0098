(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two men pleaded guilty today to trying tobribe former Navy officials, in one case buying an official'scondominium in Idaho for an inflated price in an attempt toinfluence decisions on lucrative Pentagon contracts.   U.S. Attorney Henry Hudson said the pleas from Charles F.Gardner, a former vice president of Unisys Corp., and James G. Neal,a private consultant for Unisys, ``will move this investigationforward ... at a tremendous pace.''   He called the pleas, as well as one from Kenneth F. Brooke, a``significant development'' in the 2{-year-old investigation intofraud in the Defense Department's purchasing procedures. The casehas focused on allegations that companies tried to manipulate thesystem by using consultants to pay bribes for inside informationabout contracts.   Gardner, 58, who worked until March 1988 for a Unisys division inGreat Neck, N.Y., appeared before U.S. District Judge Claude Hyltonin a packed courtroom.   ``Guilty. Guilty. Guilty,'' he said in a strong voice when askedhow he pleaded to charges of bribery, conspiracy to file falsestatements and aiding and assisting in the filing of a false taxreturn.   Gardner is a key figure whose cooperation could be significant inhelping prosecutors make major cases in the long-runninginvestigation. Today's charges link him directly to Melvyn Paisley,the former assistant secretary of the Navy for research, engineeringand systems, and, to date, the highest-ranking official publiclyidentified in the case.   Gardner also has ties to a group of firms and individuals on LongIsland whose offices have been searched by the FBI. The governmenthas said it is looking into possible extortion of campaigncontributions to congressmen in the Long Island segment of theinvestigation.   Documents provided by prosecutors said Gardner sought to bribePaisley by arranging for the purchase of Paisley's condominiium atthe Sun Valley, Idaho, ski resort in August 1986.   ``Gardner instructed James G. Neal that the condominium was to bepurchased for $149,000 and that no negotiation or attempts to lowerthe price were to be undertaken, even though the unit wasoverprice,'' Hudson said in a statement. ``The condominium wassubsequently sold for $100,000.''   Hudson said the condominium purchase at an inflated price wasdesigned to influence Paisley's actions on two Pentagon contractssought by Unisys. The prosecutor refused to say what Paisley did onUnisys' behalf. Paisley has not been charged with any crime.   In another case, Gardner caused the campaign committees of Rep.Roy Dyson, D-Md., and former Rep. Bill Chappell, D-Fla., to receiveillegal campaign contributions of $1,000 each, Hudson said.   ``In addition, Gardner caused Unisys to make and present a falseclaim to the departments of Navy and Air Force for services notperformed,'' he said.   Gardner, who with the others agreed to cooperate with prosecutorsin the ongoing investigation, faces up to 23 years in prison andfines of up to $750,000.   Neal, 63, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to bribe Garland TomlinJr., who at the time was a Navy employee. Neal paid Tomlin about$400,000 to influence Tomlin official decisions, prosecutors said.Tomlin has not been charged with any crime.   Neal also pleaded guilty to making false claims to the governmentand conspiring to defraud the government by concealing his truetaxable income. He faces up to 15 years in prison and fines of$750,000.   Brooke, 40, a stepson of William Galvin, a consultant whose namehas been linked to Paisley's, evaded his taxes in 1985, prosecutorssaid. He faces a sentence of five years in prison and a fine of upto $250,000.   Hylton set sentencing for July 14.</TEXT></DOC>
