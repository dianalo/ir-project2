Garcia </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> STK SCR NDX </IN><TEXT>   &quot;A waffle to a downward shuffle&quot; isn't a new dance craze gripping the nation -- it's how some analysts and portfolio managers expect stock prices to move in the next few weeks.    Lingering concerns about the direction of the economy, the lagging performance of blue-chip stocks, and fresh memories of the market's recent erratic movements, such as Thursday's abrupt afternoon reversal, are all likely to keep investors cautious about adding more stocks to their portfolios.    Hugh Johnson, chief investment strategist at First Albany Corp., is one analyst who expects stock prices &quot;to waffle&quot; because &quot;the news on the economy doesn't look particularly encouraging.&quot; Tomorrow's report on the January index of leading economic indicators could fall squarely into that &quot;not encouraging&quot; category.    Twelve economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report expect the index to have dropped 0.4% last month, its fourth consecutive decline. A string of three monthly declines in the index, which is designed to gauge economic trends, usually is seen as a signal of a recession ahead.    &quot;Four consecutive declines could deepen the concerns about recession, and markets don't do very well in that type of an environment,&quot; said Mr. Johnson. Such concerns rob money managers and individual investors of the urgency to buy stocks, he adds. &quot;That's why the market hasn't gained much momentum whenever it's started advancing&quot; this year.    That lack of momentum has been most obvious in the performance of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Although the average rose 5.64 to 2023.21 Friday, it's just 4.73% ahead of its late November level.    However, uncertainty about where the economy is headed hasn't kept some investors from going after some small-company stocks, such as those traded in the over-the-counter market and on the American Stock Exchange. These issues have pulled ahead of the blue chips after languishing in their own bear market since mid-1983. The Nasdaq OTC composite index eased 0.22 to 363.40 Friday, but it's up 13.63% in the past 13 weeks.    The small-capitalization stocks usually outperform blue-chip issues in January as they bounce back after being depressed by tax-loss selling at the end of each year. Last year, these little stocks were unduly crushed by the October market collapse and unusually aggressive tax selling as investors took their losses from the crash. The &quot;January effect&quot; actually started in early December and has now lingered one month beyond the usual deadline.    Mary Farrell, a market analyst with PaineWebber in New York, says the valuations of these small-company stocks, relative to the big-capitalization issues, have been very attractive to investors. Even with an uncertain economic environment, &quot;many (of these small companies) will have real unit growth&quot; this year, she adds.    Mr. Johnson at First Albany says investors may find some double-barreled advantages in some of these smaller-capitalization issues: The stocks are cheap and the companies have market niches that could shield them from any slowdowns in the economy.    For instance, rather than buying the lower-priced stock of an aerospace company that could be hurt by reduced defense spending and lower aircraft sales in a recession, Mr. Johnson believes an investor might be better off with a company in the jet-engine maintenance business, a service that might be in higher demand when times are rough.    It may be too early to say if the advance seen so far in the small-capitalization stocks is the start of a prolonged ascent or just a fake-out. Brian Luedtke, a technical analyst with Piper Jaffray Hopwood in Minneapolis, says that for the first time in years, money managers are asking about small companies that could be attractive buys.    Thomas Hodgman, president of the Portfolio Group in New York, is one manager who is already wading into this sector of the market. He says he's buying shares of a company that will probably have $35 million in sales this year and earnings of about $6 million.    He says he wouldn't have bought this issue, which has only 4.4 million shares outstanding, four months ago. But &quot;I'm doing it now because I believe, at worst, OTC performance will be equal with the broader market and it may even be better&quot; this year.    Mr. Hodgman isn't buying small-company issues just because they're cheap; he's also going after quality issues. He's zeroing in on concerns with a higher return on equity, a lower debt-to-total-capital ratio, and nearly double the growth rate of the companies in Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index.    However, not all managers are as sanguine as Mr. Hodgman. David Printy, president of Morison Asset Management in Minneapolis, says 35% of the assets in a balanced portfolio that he manages are invested in stocks. But he's sticking to larger-capitalization stocks. &quot;You can make some money (with OTC stocks), but you're exposing yourself to considerable risk. Who knows what next week might bring?&quot;    Mr. Printy says he feels pretty well-insulated against wide swings in the stock market with a big cash position of 35%, another 30% in 10-year to 20-year bonds and the rest in stocks with high dividend yields and low price-earnings ratios.    ---   Friday's Market Activity   Stock prices had wide swings in a moderately active session, ending just slightly higher.    A continued decline in crude oil and other commodity prices failed to rouse investors to buy equities. Bonds rallied smartly, since such news bodes well for the inflation outlook.    New York Stock Exchange volume fell to 158.1 million shares from 213.5 million Thursday. Without several dividend-capture programs, volume would have been even lower, traders said.    Among the active issues, Federated Department Stores rose 1 3/8 to 64 1/2. The retailer may be succumbing to Campeau's advance, opening talks with the Torontobased concern after Campeau sweetened its bid to $68 a share.    Atlas Corp. soared 4 1/4 to 37 1/4. An investor group that holds a 20.4% stake in the company said the Bronfman family of Canada is seeking to buy its shares for $34 each.    General Development gained 2 3/4 to 15 3/4; Mohasco added 1 7/8 to 29 1/4; and Ausimont rose 3 to 23. The gains were fueled by takeover rumors. </TEXT></DOC>
