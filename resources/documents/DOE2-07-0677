Therefore these developments have been studied and evaluatedin detail directly during the period between 1 January 1985 and 30 September1985. This final report introduces the new developments, describes theprocess concept, flow-sheet and current status of each of the significantprocess developments, gives a technical analysis of the types of processconfigurations being developed, and presents economic analyses and comparisonsbetween the various processes. Information on each of the developmentshas been collected by literature surveys, correspondence and visits toand discussions with the process developers. On the basis of the informationcollected and the technical analyses carried out, conclusions are drawnon the probable impact of the new technologies in different economicscenarios, and recommendations for further technical development effortswithin Europe are proposed.</TEXT></DOC>
