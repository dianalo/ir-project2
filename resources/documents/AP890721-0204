(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The developer of an $85 million alcoholfuel plant in eastern West Virginia says the idea to convert wasteproducts into alcohol isn't revolutionary _ he's just built abetter mousetrap.   The plant, to be built on 300 acres in Hampshire County, isdesigned to produce ethanol from recycled paper and wood products.Construction is slated to begin within two months and the plant isscheduled to be operating by early 1991.   ``We just take anything that has cellulose in it and break itdown,'' said Richard Wells, the head of KR Biochem in Tulsa, Okla.``You break it down to a sugar component and then you can fermentsugar into any kind of product you want.''   Wells declined to reveal the specific process that will be usedto produce the alcohol.   One alcohol fuels expert was skeptical about Wells' plans.   ``I'm actually surprised they're putting in a plant unlessthey've found some new process,'' said Doug Gardner, assistantprofessor of wood science at West Virginia University. He said hedidn't know the process KR Biochem would use, but that the cost ofoil usually determines whether an alternative fuels project will besuccessful.   ``We had the energy crisis and the price of oil got expensive,''prompting several alternative fuel development projects, Gardnersaid. ``Then the oil price dropped.   ``These processes generally are more expensive (than oil), sothe fuel isn't worth doing. If the price of fuel goes up, thenthese processes might be economically feasible.''   Wells said the key to his plans is the raw products his plantwill use.   ``You must remember we're using waste materials,'' he said. ``Ifyou use waste materials you normally don't pay much for them exceptmaybe cost of freight. With the feedstock nearly free it makes itcost-effective.   ``That's one of the drawbacks to using ethanol right now is(producers) use grain and it's very expensive. As a result, it'sdifficult for ethanol producers to compete with crude oil that's socheap.   ``If we use ... waste then we can compete with crude oil nomatter what the price.''   The scrap paper used would come primarily from the East Coast.The operation also would use sawdust from West Virginia lumbercompanies.   Wells said he chose West Virginia for a variety of reasons,including the state's pledge to provide federal employee trainingmoney and its central location.   Gardner said the cellulose found in wood and paper is formedfrom glucose molecules. The glucose, or sugar, can be fermented andturned into alcohol.   Wells, whose said his company has 25 years of experiencebuilding gas and oil facilities, said the Tennessee ValleyAuthority researched the process and last week conducted ademonstration.   ``They just proved that what we're doing works,'' he said,adding that the TVA will act as a consultant to KR Biochem.   The plant, which is to employ 100 workers to start and up to2,000 in four to six years, would be capable of producing 32million gallons of ethanol a year, he said.   Wells said there is a strong national market for ethanol, whichis used to enhance the octane in gasoline.   But, he said, ``Its real benefit is it's a total substitute forgasoline. It doesn't have the pollution of gasoline and underPresident Bush's alternative fuels legislation, it calls forreplacing gasoline with ethanol.''   Bush's proposal is to have 1 million alternative-fuel vehicleson the road by 1995.   ``Alcohol is big business already,'' Wells said. ``It takesabout two barrels of oil to equal one barrel of fuel-gradealcohol.''   Several projects to produce ethanol-powered cars, such as inBrazil, have been scrapped over the years because of the fuel'scost. But Wells is confident he can produce the ethanol morecheaply.   Wells also said, however, that his plant wouldn't be limited toproducing alcohol.   ``There are probably over 50 products that can be made from thisplant ... with minor changes,'' he said. ``Ethanol is just one ofthem.''</TEXT></DOC>
