Snow gave way to freezing rain Friday in an icy trail across theupper Midwest and the Northeast but power outages caused by earlierblizzards continued.   ``Hot wires are falling all over the place,'' said policedispatcher Rosemarie Million in Erie, Pa.   The Puget Sound area of Washington was hit for the secondstraight year with unusually heavy snowfalls. Seattle had up to 10inches of snow by Saturday morning and Olympia, to the south, hadan accumulation of 20 inches from snowfalls Wednesday and Friday.   The area, noted for its rain not its snow, saw two snowfalls inSeattle last year of about 12 inches each, and Olympia had abouthalf that last year.   A few rivers began receding in some areas of the Southeast thismorning, but other rivers were still rising after up to 12 inchesof rain fell on the region. Flooding has claimed at least fourlives since Friday.   The Ocoee River jumped its banks, swept away a new bridge andran 8 feet deep in the streets of Copperhill, Tenn., and across theriver at McCaysville, Ga., where about 500 people were evacuatedfrom their homes.   ``There are porches from other houses that have been damaged andare coming down the river,'' said Russell Newman, a rescueofficial. ``I don't know whether you'd call it looting or not, butI saw some guys fishing stuff out of the river as it floated by.''   The Ocoee also swamped a footbridge at a Tennessee ValleyAuthority hydroelectric dam, flooding the power station andtrapping six TVA workers, who were rescued by helicopter.   Police in the Atlanta suburb of Smyrna today found the body of a69-year-old man in a car in a flooded parking lot, where thevehicle apparently stalled and submerged.   Churning waters forced the evacuation of up to 1,000 people inTrion, Ga., about 30 miles south of Chattanooga, Tenn. A mandrowned when his car stalled in floodwaters. This morning, theChattooga County sheriff's department said the water recededseveral feet overnight and main roads were now open, but thatauthorities were not allowing residents back to their homes yet.   Gerald Birdo of the National Weather Service said the floodingin some areas of the South was the worst since 1979.   ``I don't ever recall seeing this much rain in this short aperiod,'' said Carl Parker, a 30-year weather service veteran inFort Payne, Ala., site of 8 inches of rain in under 24 hours.   One of many twisters that tunneled through the Southeastdestroyed or damaged 38 homes in Carrollton, Ga.   ``Some houses looked like they just exploded,'' said Capt.Robert Lee of the Carroll County Sheriff's Department. ``It lookedlike a bomb hit right in the middle of the subdivision.''   Tornadoes also were recorded in Alabama, South Carolina andMississippi.   About 80 people were evacuated from a flooded rest home inCullowhee, in western North Carolina. A man in nearby TransylvaniaCounty was swept away by the rain-swollen French Broad River as hetried to save his trout farm.   Rapidly rising waters closed dozens of schools and roads innorthern Alabama, while tornadoes in the southern part of the stateripped apart mobile homes and shattered trees. At least 200 peoplestatewide had to leave their homes.   An elderly woman lost her footing and drowned while fording aflooded creek near her home in Cherokee County, Ala., innortheastern Alabama near the Georgia border, said Leon Smith, thecounty's emergency management coordinator.   Meanwhile, the heaviest winter storm in 74 years blanketed Reno,Nev., with snow that fell at rates of up to 4 inches, and freezinghomes were blacked out by a power outage.   The snow was so blindingly fast and heavy that even a sled dograce scheduled to begin today had to be be postponed until Sunday.   Snow closed nearly 80 miles of Interstate 80 in northernCalifornia on Friday, dumping up to 3 feet of fresh snow on themountains, with 2 feet recorded at Placerville and 18 inches inAuburn.   At dawn, I-80 still was closed from Auburn to the Nevada stateline, but westbound lanes opened early today for vehicles with tirechains. U.S. 50 was open to vehicles with chains, which wererequired on all mountain roads.   More snow fell overnight in the Sierra Nevada, withaccumulations of up to 2 feet expected, the National WeatherService said, but much of the storm was heading east toward Utahand Wyoming.   Lyle LaFaver, a spokesman for Pacific Gas and Electric, saidtens of thousands of customers were without power late Friday ``andthey'll probably be out all night.''   ``We've had problems with very heavy, very wet snow,'' he said.   In the San Francisco Bay area, wind gusts to 60 mph downed treesand power lines Friday, and heavy rains caused mud slides andsnarle traffic.</TEXT></DOC>
