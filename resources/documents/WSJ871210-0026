Iran yesterday continued its hard-line stance, but moderated its rhetoric following a private meeting with the delegation from Venezuela.    In fact, the Venezuelan delegation last night appeared to be reassuming its position as a mediator between Iran and Saudi Arabia. It held such a role last year when it helped promote a compromise between the two that paved the way for this year's pricing and production pact. Soon after the opening day session ended at 10:30 p.m., the Venezuelan minister began a private meeting with his counterparts from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, who together are leading the opposition to Iran's call for a higher benchmark price and to the Iranian effort to block an increase in the production quota of its war foe, Iraq.    Iran's war with Iraq is casting a pall over the meeting, raising doubts about whether the 13-nation cartel can calm anxious oil markets by fixing a benchmark price and a production ceiling for 1988. Runaway production by some exporters, chiefly Iraq -- as well as price discounting by Iran and others -- have caused serious doubts about whether OPEC can sustain its current $18-a-barrel base price in the face of huge oil inventories and an uncertain world-wide economic outlook.    OPEC President Alhaji Rilwanu Lukman, oil minister of Nigeria, warned that cheating by fellow members &quot;could ultimately backfire on all of us&quot; and called on delegates to reach an agreement that will provide &quot;permanent, impregnable stability&quot; to world oil markets. He, too, ruled out a &quot;lengthy, exhausting, torturous meeting&quot; like those held last year to address the previous collapse in oil prices.    But even as the ministers assembled for their opening ceremonies yesterday, Iran renewed its call for an oil price increase of at least $2 a barrel, which the Arab nations flatly reject, and repeated its unwillingness to sign any agreement that increases the production quota of Iraq, which the Arab nations are also seeking. Gholamreza Aghazadeh, oil minister of Iran, suggested that his country would sabotage world oil markets by doubling its production, dumping the output at any price necessary if OPEC failed to reach an agreement suitable to Iran.    Among most of the other 12 ministers here, Iran's demands continue falling on deaf ears. Persian Gulf members refused to retreat from their take-it-or-leave-it position that Iraq receive output &quot;parity&quot; with Iran, and that the $18-a-barrel price be maintained. &quot;He won't get anything,&quot; said a high-ranking Arab oil company official of Iran's minister. &quot;He'll be lucky to leave Vienna with his clothes on.&quot;    &quot;The Iranians are taking a tight stand -- but they will soften it,&quot; said an Iranian who was formerly a member of the OPEC secretariat. Indeed, Mr. Aghazadeh met privately at the Vienna Marriott for more than an hour yesterday with the delegation of Arturo Hernandez Grisanti of Venezuela, which has played the role of OPEC's peacemaker in the past. Afterward, Mr. Aghazadeh, while repeating his unwillingness to have Iraq awarded parity, added, &quot;For OPEC, it is vital to have a conclusion and understanding.&quot;    By one of the odd twists of reason prevailing here, many ministers believe that increasing Iraq's quota is essential to reducing OPEC's overall production, which is far in excess of the average of 17.5 million barrels a day foreseen by the majority of OPEC's economic specialists for all of 1988. Iraq is producing more than a million barrels a day above its quota of 1.5 million barrels a day -- but indicates that it will honor a higher quota equal to Iran's 2.4 million barrels.    Some ministerial advisers say that the dispute could be resolved simply by jettisoning Iran from OPEC. On the other hand, the ministers could prevail on Iraq to accept a quota only slightly lower than Iran's, enabling the Iranians to save face. Finally, one adviser said, OPEC officially could maintain Iraq's lower quota, while agreeing to look the other way as it produced to excess -- so long as the production was no more than Iran's.    The Iraqi minister offered at last night's session to reduce his country's production by 500,000 barrels a day. Based on his claim that Iraq's November production totaled 2,830,000 barrels a day, that would leave Iraq's net output in line with Iran's quota -- but still much higher than the about two million barrels a day that the Iranians are actually producing. According to one account, the Iranian minister responded during the meeting with a threat that for every barrel Iraq's quota is increased, Iran would produce two barrels more.    Suspense over the outcome of the meeting has drawn an unusual number of major oil company representatives here, including observers from Royal Dutch/Shell Group, Exxon Corp., Atlantic Richfield Co., Coastal Corp. and Sun Co. Antitrust-sensitive major U.S. oil companies have always avoided appearing at the cartel's meetings. </TEXT></DOC>
