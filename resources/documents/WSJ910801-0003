The transportation company had launched a luxury &quot;cruisetrain,&quot; The Sierra 49er Express, carrying passengers betweenSan Francisco and Lake Tahoe, but the line was closed afterfive months of service ending in April.</LP><TEXT>   The operator of the defunct line, the company's TransciscoTours Inc. subsidiary, is included under the Chapter 11petition. All other operating units of the company includingits rail services and leasing units &quot;remain viable and willcontinue to do business as usual,&quot; the company said.   Transcisco said its Chapter 11 filing was provoked by theaction of three holders of Transcisco's subordinated debt,who filed an involuntary petition for relief under Chapter 7to force the company into federal bankruptcy in early July.   A Transcisco spokesman said the bankruptcy court approvedthe company's motion to convert the case from the involuntaryChapter 7 filing by investors, to a voluntary Chapter 11filing by the company.   The move by the three shareholders was precipitated by thecompany's decision in June to delay a $700,000 semiannualpayment on its $15 million, 9% convertible seniorsubordinated notes.   Transcisco incurred a loss of $5.1 million, or $1.16 ashare, in the first quarter, compared with profit of $4.5million, or three cents a share, a year earlier. Compoundingthe company's financial woes from the Sierra train failure,Transcisco was left with $12 million of railcars toliquidate.</TEXT></DOC>
