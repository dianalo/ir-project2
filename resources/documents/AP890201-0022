Brady said the ``driving force'' behind the LBO phenomenon isthat companies can avoid a 34 percent corporate income tax rate byraising capital through debt rather than stock.   He said the Treasury Department also has been attempting to finda way through Internal Revenue Service regulations or a legislativeproposal to make the tax treatment of stock-equity and bond-debtfinancing more equal.   ``The LBO problem would disappear with a level playing field,''he said. ``But so far we haven't been able to come up with a way todo it.''   Brady also suggested that the best action might be inaction.   ``We have a habit of correcting things just as they are about tocorrect themselves,'' Brady said. ``If we wait a little longer, thisthing is not going to gobble us up.''   But Brady conceded the administration is concerned about therapid rate with which companies are going into debt to launchtakeovers or defend against them through stock buybacks _ both oftenfinanced by high-interest junk bonds.   Rep. J.J. Pickle, D-Texas, likened Brady's qualified endorsementof taxing interest on takeover-related debt to ``a kiss through aveil'' and criticized him for not coming up with specificsuggestions or data on the impact of the buyouts on the federaltreasury.   With a ``that depends'' answer, Brady evaded a question onwhether President Bush's desire to reduce the capital gains taxwould only encourage more buyouts since shareholders would have topay less tax on the 35 percent to 45 percent above-market pricesthey often get in the transactions.   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., said it is ironic the outcry forcongressional action to curb takeovers ``has become deafening'' inthe past 16 months.   In 1987 the House had approved similar legislation to limit thetax deductibility of interest on junk bonds and other borrowing usedin financing takeovers.   But it suffered a quick death in negotiations with the Senateafter then-Treasury Secretary and now Secretary of State James A.Baker tried to blame the bill as the cause of the October 1987 stockmarket crash.   Since then, the size of companies being taken over through junkbonds has increased several times. And instead of just plantsclosing and workers losing jobs, owners of more traditionallong-term, investment-grade bonds in the companies being acquiredhave seen the value of their holdings diminished in some takeovers.   For example, holders of some $5 billion in long-term bonds inRJR-Nabisco Co., lost $1 billion overnight when credit agenciesdowngraded their rating upon the announcement of the company'stakeover by LBO specialist Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co.   Rostenkowski and other lawmakers also have questioned whethermany of the newly restructured companies will be able to make theinterest payments on their much higher debt and avoid bankruptcy ifand when a recession occurs.   ``I have a feeling that we're looking at a Richter scale that'sshowing zero and then we have an eruption of 7 or 8 on the scale andit's too late,'' said Rep. Thomas J. Downey, D-N.Y., using a majorearthquake as a metaphor.</TEXT></DOC>
