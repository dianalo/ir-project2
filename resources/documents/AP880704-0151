A second large anti-U.S. protest outside Clark Air Base endedpeacefully.   Also Monday, President Corazon Aquino said she ordered immediatesolutions to a string of unresolved political murders in thecapital.   Violence erupted outside the seaside U.S. Embassy near the endof the three-hour protest as some demonstrators hurled rocks andsticks at outnumbered riot police.   Then two homemade bombs exploded, showering police with shrapnelbut causing only minor injuries. Five policemen and a femalebystander received burns and small cuts.   ``We thought it was all over,'' police Lt. Col. Robert Barberstold reporters. ``There was no warning. We just heard two loudexplosions and they started throwing stones at us.''   Barbers said at least three homemade bombs spiked with one-inchnails were thrown at the police lines, but one did not explode.   The demonstrators included students, peasants, factory workers,teachers and at least one member of the House of Representatives,Bonifacio Gillego.   Protest leaders cut their fingers with razor blades and signed a``manifesto of eviction'' in blood, telling the U.S. government todismantle the bases by 1991, when their current lease expires.   An American official received the document through the embassy'sreinforced steel gates.   ``Come 1991, we are going to remove the bases if the Americansdo not remove them voluntarily,'' Gillego said in a speech an hourbefore the violence.   ``There is nothing more evil in the face of this planet thanU.S. imperialism,'' labor leader Crispin Beltran told the crowd.``There is no need to negotiate with them.''   In Angeles City, about 50 miles north of Manila, approximately3,000 leftist protesters rallied outside the gates of the U.S.-runClark Air Base.   About 200 Filipino troops guarded Clark's main gate, standingbehind barbed wire barricades while a helicopter gunship hoveredoverhead, but the four-hour rally ended peacefully. Thedemonstrators burned effigies of a missile draped with an Americanflag.   Both rallies were demanding the closure of Clark, Subic BayNaval Base and four smaller installations the United Statesmaintains in the Philippines.   Mrs. Aquino meanwhile said after meeting with the PhilippineConstabulary chief, Maj. Gen. Ramon Montano, that she had demandedaction on the unsolved murders. The Constabulary is the country'sinternal security force charged with maintaining law and ordernationwide.   ``I told him that we really have to come up with a speedysolution of these cases. Otherwise, people will lose confidence inus,'' the president told reporters. She said she arranged a meetingwith National Bureau of Investigation officials.   At least 130 politically motivated murders have been committedin the capital since Mrs. Aquino came to power in 1986. Most remainunsolved.   Human rights groups have blamed the murders of leftistpersonalities on rightist death squads, while the killings ofpolicemen, soldiers, suspected civilian informers and governmentofficials have been attributed by military and police authoritiesto urban-based communist guerrillas.</TEXT></DOC>
