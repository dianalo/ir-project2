NPF-11 and NPF-18,issued to Commonwealth Edison Company, (the licensee), for operation ofthe LaSalle County Station, Units 1 and 2, located in LaSalle County, Illinois.<ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Assessment </ITAG>Identification of Proposed Action The proposed amendments would revise the provisions in the Technical Specifications(TS) relating to the deletion of the 3.25 limitation from the refuel outageinterval surveillance. The proposed action is in accordance with the licensee's application foramendment dated December 4, 1987, as supplemented by a letter dated March10, 1989. The Need for the Proposed Action The proposed change to the TS is required in order to provide flexibilityfor scheduling the performance of surveillance and to permit considerationof plant operating conditions that may not be suitable for conducting asurveillance at its specified time interval. Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action The Commission has completed its evaluation of the proposed revision toTechnical Specifications. The proposed revisions would allow the licenseeto exempt surveillance specified within an 18-month surveillance intervalfrom the provision of Specification 4.0.2 that limits the combined timeinterval for three consecutive surveillances to 3.25 times the 18-monthsurveillance interval. Therefore, the proposed changes do not increasethe probability or consequences of accidents, no changes are being madein the types of any effluents that may be released offsite, and there isno significant increase in the allowable individual or cumulative occupationalradiation exposure. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that this proposedaction would result in no significant radiological environmental impact.With regard to potential non-radiological impacts, the proposed changeto the TS involves systems located within the restricted area as definedin 10 CFR Part 20. It does not affect non-radiological plant effluentsand has no other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission concludesthat there are no significant non-radiological environmental impact associatedwith the proposed amendment. The Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment and Opportunity forHearing in connection with this action was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on April 14, 1989 (54 FR 15040). No request forhearing or petition for leave to intervene was filed following this notice.Alternative to the Proposed Action Since the Commission concluded that there are no significant environmentaleffects that would result from the proposed action, any alternatives withequal or greater environmental impacts need not be evaluated. The principal alternative would be to deny the requested amendment. Thiswould not reduce environmental impacts of plant operation and would resultin reduced operational flexibility. Alternative Use of Resources This action does not involve the use of any resources not previously consideredin the Final Environmental Statements for LaSalle County Station, Units1 and 2, dated November 1978. Agencies and Persons Consulted The NRC staff reviewed the licensee's request and did not consult otheragencies or persons. <ITAG tagnum="84">Finding of no Significant Impact </ITAG>The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statementfor the proposed license amendment. Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, we conclude that theproposed action will not have a significant effect on the quality of thehuman environment.
