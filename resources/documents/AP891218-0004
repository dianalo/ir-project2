(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   When five people were indicted on chargesof sexually abusing children at a day-care center, the newsreverberated through this town of 5,800, seemingly touchingeveryone.   In the months since the first allegations were made againstLittle Rascals' Day Care Center last January, wave after wave ofindictments have been handed up. Court documents listing 202charges say day-care workers had intercourse in front of childrenand performed oral and anal sex with them from September 1988 toJanuary 1989.   The initial reports were based on evidence from 21 children whowere allegedly molested, but prosecutors say all of theapproximately 70 children who attended the center are potentialwitnesses. The center lost its license in June and was closed.   Nearly everyone here knows someone who has been indicted or thefamily of a child involved in the case.   ``I've watched some of the parents of victims grow up,'' saidAlton Elmore, owner of Edenton Furniture and a Chowan Countycommissioner. ``And I've watched some of them who've been chargedgrow up.''   That sense of community makes it doubly difficult for residentsto deal with the sudden onslaught of news media and curiosityseekers.   A clerk at a children's clothing store shied away fromdiscussing the case with a stranger. ``The manager of the store'slittle girl is involved in it, so I don't think I should sayanything,'' she said.   Other people offered similar responses.   ``It's just a bad situation. Some are very upset,'' said JohnSmith, owner of Edenton Floral Co., a block away from the choppywaters of the Albemarle Sound.   But while people are reluctant to talk about the case tooutsiders, they are freer among themselves. Rumors grew so abundantat one point that District Attorney H.P. Williams issued astatement warning residents that they could jeopardize the state'scase.   Townspeople are beginning to tire of the lengthy pre-trialhearings, sometimes grumbling that Williams has been dragging hisfeet since the first hearing April 14, when the first arrestoccurred.   Williams, up for re-election next November, has sometimes foundhimself in an unkind public spotlight and appeared reluctant todiscuss even tangential issues.   Public outrage and a concern for the children may have promptedbonds ranging from $375,000 to $1.5 million _ so high that only onedefendant has been released.   All but one of the defendants is charged with the same fourcrimes: engaging in sex with a child under 13, taking indecentliberties with a minor, crimes against nature, and conspiracy tocommit indecent liberties with a child.   The fifth, former Little Rascals' employee Shelley Stone, ischarged with all but crimes against nature.   All five defendants have pleaded innocent.   Robert Kelly Jr., 41, who operated Little Rascals with his wife,Elizabeth Kelly, 34, is in jail on $1.5 million bond. He is chargedwith 152 counts involving at least 21 boys and girls under age 13.   Mrs. Kelly is charged with 19 counts involving eight childrenand faces a $1 million bond. A friend of the Kellys', Willard ScottPrivott, 40, has been charged with 13 counts involving sixchildren, plus kidnapping and terrorizing one girl. He is beingheld on $1 million bond.   Kathryn Dawn Wilson, 23, another employee, is charged with 19counts involving eight children.   Ms. Stone, who is accused of nine counts, is the only one of thefive to post bond _ $375,000 in her case. However her lawyer saidhe was worried that she might be named in new indictments andarrested without warning.   Joe Cheshire, the Raleigh attorney representing Kelly, called it``an incredible case.'' He contended that much of the children'stestimony would show that nothing wrong had taken place, and wouldexonerate his client.   ``It's very strange to me,'' Cheshire said. ``You have a coupleof kids make some statements and months later you have some moreand now we hear there are some more. I'd just like to find out howthat process happened.''   But Assistant Attorney General Bill Hart said there is nomystery about the process.   ``We have had continuing disclosure just like the defense hasbeen getting,'' he said. ``Children don't just come running out oftheir houses screaming, `I've been molested.'''   Elmore said each new revelation rocks the community in a wayhe's never experienced. ``A lot of good people and the families ofgood people have gotten hurt,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
