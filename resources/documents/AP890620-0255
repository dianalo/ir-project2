Forged Monday night, the U.S. offer valued Gateway at $3.39 ashare and would give 50-50 ownership of the company to Wasserstein,Perella andamp; Co. and Aandamp;P, which is the fourth-largest U.S. foodretailer. Aandamp;P is 52.5 percent owned by West Germany's TengelmannGroup.   The partners will put up a total of $780 million and borrowanother $3.4 billion from banks and other sources. Some of the moneywill go toward refinancing more than $600 million of debt onGateway's books.   Gateway Chairman Alec Monk would remain chairman under the deal,but Aandamp;P Chairman James Wood would take over as chief executiveofficer in addition to his current duties.   Long outperformed by competitors, Gateway in April became thetarget of a $2.9 billion hostile bid from investor group IsoscelesPLC, a consortium.   Isosceles may find it hard to increase its already sweetenedoffer to beat the new one, analysts said. The consortium haseffective control of about 27 percent of Gateway shares outstanding.   The offer expires Thursday.   Monk, who spent about $2.0 billion on takeovers between 1982 and1986, transformed a struggling family-run wholesale food businessknown as Linfood Holdings into a big British retail holding company.   Monk financed a number of acquisitions through stock offerings,doubling the company's shares outstanding and depressing its shareprice. Support among shareholders slipped further when he ran intodifficulty digesting Herman's Sporting Goods Inc. of Carteret, N.J.,acquired for $414 million in 1986.   Gateway controls about 11.4 percent of the British grocery market.   The company posted a 3.3 percent drop in pretax profit for thefiscal year ended April 30, 1988, the latest full-year resultsavailable.
