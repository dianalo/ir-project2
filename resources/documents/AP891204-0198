Says Laird now: ``The `secret plan' was in my head. ...Withdrawal was the only alternative we had and we had to do it inan orderly fashion. You could have had public support for the firsttwo years, probably, but not beyond that.''   So on March 5, 1969, six weeks after Nixon's inauguration, Lairdflew to Saigon to present his concept of scheduled, systematicwithdrawals _ to take place regardless of what was happening on thebattlefield _ to Abrams, a tank commander who in 1968 had succeededGen. William C. Westmoreland as chief of the Military AssistanceCommand, Vietnam (MACV).   According to Clarke's account, the general balked, insisting``that all withdrawals depend on his assessment of the militarysituation in Vietnam.''   The Joint Chiefs of Staff backed up Abrams, setting the stagefor a long struggle between Washington and MACV.   Laird's recollection is somewhat different. He says Abrams mighthave made his objections known, but always ultimately went alongwith Laird.   ``General Abrams pointed out certain reasons why he thought theprogram I laid out was too rapid a withdrawal ... but he was moresupportive of my withdrawal figures than were the Joint Chiefs ofStaff. That's why I promoted Abrams to Army chief of staff over theobjections of the White House. They were not great Abrams fansthere.''   In any event, it was a struggle. Here's the story, as laid outin Clarke's official history:   _In March 1969 Laird returns from his visit to Saigon andreports to Nixon that the size of the American contingency isactually stiffling South Vietnamese initiative.   He says the ``orientation'' of American military leaders ``seemsto be more on operations than on assisting the South Vietnamese toacquire the means to defend themselves.'' That, he says, explainsMACV's tolerance of Saigon's high military desertion rate andmarginal military leadership. He says MACV has no program to reducethe American military commitment and contends ``the development ofsuch a program should receive our first priority.''   He recommends withdrawing 50,000 to 75,000 soldiers in 1969.   _Abrams approves tentative planning for withdrawing 50,000soldiers but repeats ``his personal opposition to unilateral U.S.troop withdrawals and his insistence that all withdrawals depend onhis assessment of the military situation in Vietnam.''   _In April 1969, Kissinger, with Nixon's approval, embracesLaird's concept and signs a directive instructing the defensesecretary to prepare ``a specific timetable for Vietnamizing thewar.'' His directive foresees ``the progressive transfer ... of thefighting effort'' to South Vietnamese forces without insisting onan expansion of the South Vietnamese army _ and even withoutawaiting a reduction in the number of North Vietnamese troops inSouth Vietnam.   Kissinger says U.S. withdrawals are to start July 1. The UnitedStates is to return to a support and advisory mission in Vietnam.   _In May, Abrams questions the size and pace of the projectedwithdrawals. Gen. Earle G. Wheeler, chairman of the Joint Chiefs,assures him that Kissinger's July 1 target was picked only forplanning purposes. Wheeler says American redeployments will takeinto consideration the military situation.   ``But Abrams knew better and his concern proved justified,'' thebook says. ``Only a few days after Wheeler's second communique, hereceived notice that withdrawals might come sooner than expectedand to prepare alternate plans for the redeployment of 50,000 and100,000 troops.''   _MACV reluctantly draws up a Vietnamization plan but it is basedon the ``major assumption'' that about 275,000 support troops willremain following the withdrawal of most combat forces. Thatinsistence on maintaining a huge support contingent, Clarke says,was ``the principal response of American military leaders to whatseemed to be an impossible order'' from Washington.   In its war assessment, MACV advises Washington that the SouthVietnamese will not be capable before 1972 of handling even theViet Cong _ not to mention the heavily armed and better-trainedNorth Vietnamese _ and even then U.S. advisory and materiel supportwill be required ``indefinitely.''   MACV says that until then the Saigon forces ``simply are notcapable of attaining the level of self-sufficiency and overwhelmingforce superiority that would be required to counter combined VietCong insurgency and North Vienamese Army main force offenses.''   _In June, Nixon announces the withdrawal of the first 25,000Americans. He meets with South Vietnam President Nguyen Van Thieuat Midway Island to discuss Vietnamization.   ``Saigon accepted American withdrawals as a politicalnecessity,'' Clarke writes.   But Thieu points out that the Americans had been preparingSaigon merely, as Clarke put it, ``to deal with a residualinsurgency,'' not to square off against the strength of the entireNorth Vietnamese army.   The South Vietnamese president asks for an immense increase inmilitary equipment if his army is to fight both the Viet Conginsurgents and the North Vietnamese army _ heavy main battle tanksand missile tanks, howitzers, artillery, radar, anti-aircraftmissiles, C-130 air transports and 95 other aircraft _ as well asthe wherewithal for a big expansion of Saigon's air, armor andartillery units. Additionally, Thieu wants a big injection offinancial aid to improve the living standards of South Vietnameseservicemen.   _Abrams advises Laird that most of Thieu's requests are unneededand, Clarke wrote, ``too expensive and too complex for the SouthVietnamese to manage by themselves.'' Abrams still assumes Americanunits will provide air defenses, even under Vietnamization.   ``He further advised Washington that no new weapons be added toSaigon's arsenal until the South Vietnamese became able to operateand maintain them.'' He opposes Thieu's request for financialsupport for South Vietnamese forces, arguing MACV should not be inthe business of raising living standards ``for one segment'' of thepopulation.   The Joint Chiefs of Staff, agreeing, says Saigon's equipment isadequate in terms of ``the limited Vietnamese technicalcapability.''   Moreover, the book says, the chiefs say the Vietnamese had notaddressed at Midway ``what American advisers considered key SouthVietnamese military weaknesses _ poor leadership and high desertionrates.''</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
