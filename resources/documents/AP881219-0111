Part of that freedom should translate to higher salaries for topresearchers even if it means fewer employees doing lower-level work,said Harold T. Shapiro, president of Princeton University andchairman of the Institute of Medicine study.   Shapiro emphasized at a news conference that the committee's twomajor recommendations _ a call for a $25 million discretionary fundfor the NIH to use to react quickly to unanticipated researchdevelopments, and higher pay at top levels _ could be accomplishedwithout an overall budget increase.   While the institutes could use more money, he said, the panelfelt strongly that its suggestions were so important they should beimplemented even if meant shifting funds around, including ``fewerpeople better paid.''   ``It's not easy to do and will take more time'' without budgetincreases, said Shapiro.   Robert G. Petersdorf, president of the Association of AmericanMedical Colleges and a committee member, agreed that ``you can do alot more with the same amount of money'' if administrators are notbound by congressional directives to maintain a certain number offull-time employees.   ``If we don't do this or something similar, we will end upeffectively undermining the effectiveness ... (of NIH) and it willno longer be a major force in biomedical research,'' said Shapiro.``It will not be able to be saved if we wake up 15 years down theline and find that has happened.''   Shapiro said the panel was not concerned about any qualitydecline that has occurred up to now. ``We in some sense wept becausewe said more could have been accomplished,'' he said. ``Thedomination ... is not what it once was.''   The report by the Institute of Medicine, which is a branch of theNational Academy of Science, said research at NIH makes ``invaluablecontributions to our knowledge and understanding of basic biologicalprocess and their dysfunction in disease.''   The report was prompted by a recommendation from the Reaganadministration's Office of Management and Budget that NIH researchbe taken from the government and turned over to private companies.   The committee of scientists said ``privatization, in the sense ofmaking the intramural (NIH research) program free-standing andself-supporting, is undesirable and impractical.''   ``None of the common forms of privatization would be as likely tosustain the vitality of the research effort as would a more modestrestructuring,'' the report said.   NIH, based in Bethesda, Md., is a confederation of 12 researchinstitutes, each dedicated to different diseases, types of disordersor speciality areas. Basic discoveries made by NIH scientists aremade available to anyone and often form the basis of subsequentapplications developed by researchers at universities and in privateindustry.   Among the report's recommendations were:   _An increase in salaries for senior researchers who are activelyrecruited by universities, hospitals and biotechnology companieswhich pay much higher wages. The report said 42 senior scientists inthe highest NIH salary range of between $77,000 and $99,500 werelured away between 1983 and 1988 by salary increases ranging from 50to 300 percent.   _That Congress charter a foundation to allow private support ofup to 10 endowed positions for senior researchers.   _That NIH be given more authority independent of its parentagency, the Department of Health and Human Services. The report saidattempts by HHS to ``micromanage'' NIH ``are counterproductive andcause NIH to be inefficient in carrying out its mission.''   _That the NIH director receive a $25 million discretionary fundto be used to respond quickly to research needs without the currentrequirement of review by HHS.   _That a personnel ``demonstration project'' be authorized byCongress to give NIH flexibility in salaries, benefits and hiringpractices. This would include a limit on personnel costs, instead ofa ceiling on the number of positions, so NIH would have more controlover how its personnel dollars are spent. </TEXT></DOC>
