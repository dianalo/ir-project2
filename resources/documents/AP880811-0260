An estimated 7,000 diseased harbor seals have died since April,about half the population in the North Sea waters of West Germany,the Netherlands, Norway, Denmark and Sweden.   West German television gives the death count nearly every nightand shows closeups of carcasses being loaded onto trucks to behauled away for disposal. More than 2,000 of the seals have died inWest German waters.   Governments, marine biologists and environmentalists agree theNorth Sea is heavily polluted and the seals are dying of one ormore viruses. The cause of the disease remains unknown.   Thousands of West Germans demonstrating concern formed a 25-milehuman chain July 24 that stretched the length of Sylt Island.   Earlier this summer, Greenpeace environmentalists tried to stopan incinerator ship from burning burning Spanish toxic waste in theNorth Sea.   Two Greenpeace activists tried to board the 3,356-ton VulcanusII about 100 miles from Britain on June 21, but crew members usinghigh-pressure water hoses knocked them into the sea and damaged theBreenpeace vessel.   Environmentalists call the seal epidemic one of the worstecological disasters ever.   ``This really shows that society is not taking care of theenvironment,'' Claudia Sieg, Hamburg spokeswoman for Greenpeace,said in a telephone interview.   Greenpeace and other environmental groups hold pollutionresponsible for the epidemic and demand that industry takeimmediate measures to stop it.   Independent scientists say the hypothesis has not been proven.They also are uncertain about consequences for other forms ofmarine life.   ``We have found a huge cocktail of different toxic agents inthese seals but we have not yet seen any direct connections betweenpollution and the disease,' said Guenter Heidemann, an expert onseals at the University of Kiel.   Heidemann added, however, that he suspects highly toxicpolychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and other chemicals have increasedthe susceptibility of harbor seals to disease.   Many North Sea beaches are considered unhealthy for swimmersbecause of manmade wastes.   Greenpeace says the Rhine, Elbe and Weser, all German rivers,carry more than 450,000 tons of phosphates and nitrates, 100 tonsof lead and 50 tons of mercury into the North Sea every year.   Scientists have found fish on Sylt's eastern shore with tumorsand lesions believed caused by pollutants spewed into the sea bythe Rhine and other rivers.   Officials and independent experts say pollution in the Rhine isfar less serious than 15 years ago because of improved treatmentplants, but they acknowledge that Swiss, West German, French andDutch factories and communities still dump waste into the river.   Oil is another source of North Sea pollution. Experts say about400,000 tons of it leak into the sea each year from offshoredrilling rigs and other sources.   Fertilizer runoff from farmland adds to the pollution load, sayscientists in the North Sea nations, but they cannot about theeffect of pollution on seal life.   Norwegian scientists have speculated that seal overpopulationmay have increased their susceptibility to viral infections.Swedish researcher Susanne Liljenstrom counters that the populationis much smaller than at the beginning of the century.   Experts also argue over whether a single virus is causing theepidemic.   Gunnar Holt of Oslo's Veterinarian Institute, said he believesthe deaths are due to a virus called ``Picorna'' that ``has beenregistered in seals before.''   ``Now it seems as if researchers have found exactly the Picornavirus which causes seal death,'' he said.   Heidemann, the West German expert, responds: ``It is not knownif this virus is mainly responsible for the epidemic. Most of theanimals die from lung infection or from infection of the stomachand gut system, but nobody knows what has really triggered thesedevelopments.''   Some put the blame on waste dumped by Britain and carried byNorth Sea currents, but the British government says responsibilitylies with continental Europe.   Whoever or whatever is to blame, the entire harbor sealpopulation may be in danger.   ``At first we thought this would soon end, but no end is insight,'' Heidemann said. ``It is a possibility that most of theseanimals might die.''</TEXT></DOC>
