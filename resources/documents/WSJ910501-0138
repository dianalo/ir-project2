The students are attorneys who ignored phone calls, letcases slide, or mingled clients' money with their own. Someare here because they besmirched the reputation of aprofession that has an image problem already. At the newEthics School of the State Bar of California, lawyers introuble with the bar association can trade eight short hoursof their free time and a $75 fee for a clean rap sheet. It'sall hush-hush.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Call me Chuck,&quot; says a participant in a Hawaiian shirt toa visiting reporter. To encourage attendance, last names areoff-limits, even to instructors.   Chuck confides that he once hired four of the mostbeautiful women he could find to hang out at a singles bar onthe beach near San Diego. They were to pick up married men --and hand out business cards for Chuck's divorce practice.&quot;Smart, huh?&quot; Chuck says proudly. &quot;It got me a lot ofclients. But it also got me on the state bar's speed dial.&quot;   Since last fall, about 55 men and women have gone toschool as part of &quot;agreements in lieu of discipline&quot; forrelatively minor misdeeds. The class has been held once everytwo months.   Ethics enrollees aren't exactly convicts, but they aren'tvolunteers, either. Here's how it works: Aggrieved client,angry opponent, judge or whoever calls bar complaint hotline. If there seems to be legitimate grounds, the bar checksit out. Then if a bar attorney thinks it appropriate, ethicsschool is recommended to the alleged violator a la &quot;Let'sMake a Deal&quot;: (We will dismiss the matter provided that youattend school. If you decline, then you risk a more severeaction.) It's smart to avail oneself of the opportunity toget off so lightly.   The school was quietly started by bar associationofficials who believe that a crash course in ethics mightlure wayward lawyers back from the brink. Apparently, manyCalifornia lawyers are fairly close to the edge. Some 68,400people called the bar's complaint hot line last year. Thebar, which regulates attorneys, can yank their licenses formisconduct. But disbarment is a drastic and cumbersomeprocedure, and the least serious lapses have tended to gounpunished.   The ethics school session starts sort of like an AAmeeting, with overtones of traffic school and group therapy.&quot;I'm Dominique,&quot; chirps instructor Dominique Snyder. &quot;But youcan call me one-oh-two-four-five-three.&quot; That's 102453, MissSnyder's Bar number. California's 130,000 licensed attorneysall have individual, six-digit code numbers.   Class members, all of whom have signed in with their barcodes, remain silent.   &quot;It's OK, really,&quot; Miss Snyder prods. &quot;I don't like totell people I'm here, either.&quot;   Soon, Chuck raises his hand with a tough question. Is itall right to walk through hospital corridors and copy thenames of potential clients off doctors' charts?   Some students groan. A few roll their eyes.   &quot;What do you think?&quot; Miss Snyder asks. Chuck shrugs. MissSnyder explains that such conduct would be permissible onlyin the rarest of circumstances.   Chuck confides that after he had to halt thebeautiful-barfly gambit, he paid college students todistribute a 32-page personal-injury law pamphlet with aphotograph of himself on the back. &quot;I didn't expect the kidsto drop the ads off at hospital waiting rooms,&quot; he says.   Bill, who has a one-man practice in Los Angeles, snortsand says such tactics disgust him. He says he personally wasdoing just fine until he &quot;kind of had some trouble at home&quot;and missed filing deadlines for clients.   Because organizational problems like that often getlawyers in hot water, the school stresses such topics as&quot;office management&quot; and &quot;general file maintenance.&quot; In anintroductory leaflet, such topics are listed under thevaguely ominous heading &quot;Re-education.&quot;   By midmorning, becoming a more upright lawyer doesn't seema top priority for some: One student daringly slides thelatest issue of Money magazine into his official EthicsSchool three-ring binder, which is filled with statutes,sample retainer-fee agreements and articles about drug andalcohol dependence.   Just before lunch, a video advises tense lawyers to getrid of difficult clients, then try rhythmic breathing, deepmuscle relaxation and self-realization exercises. &quot;Look deepwithin and ask if you are doing what you really like,&quot; coaxesthe tape.   It all may be having some effect: At the break, studentsdo seem less anxious. And several are getting friendly.   &quot;What are you in for?&quot; Chuck asks a dark-haired man.   The attorney, calling himself &quot;a small-time corporatelawyer,&quot; says he had one too many clients. When a West LosAngeles company sued its president for embezzlement, hedecided to represent them both. The bar association was notamused.   &quot;Sure, I knew there was a conflict,&quot; Mr. Small-Timeadmits. &quot;But what was I supposed to do? Not take the case andrisk losing my source of income? Basically, these bar guysdon't have a sense of compassion. Or humor.&quot;   Chuck agrees. He is chewing a roast beef sandwichdelivered by the driver of his white Cadillac limousine,which is idling at the curb. He got the car as barter fromone of his personal-injury clients, who owed him $20,000, hesays.   &quot;I'm on the cutting edge,&quot; Chuck brags. &quot;I've had 12complaints against me. The first one scared the hell out ofme, but the point is not to be intimidated. Half the peoplein there are intimidated. You can see it in how they keeptheir heads down.&quot;   When class resumes, Miss Snyder warns of making decisionssolely on the basis of financial need. She says that lawyersmost likely to get into trouble are male, aged 35 to 40, whoearn less than $50,000 a year.   Attorneys glance around the room to see who might fit thatdescription. A balding man in a green velour-trimmed pulloverfesses up to being in the category. He is a probate lawyerwho lost track of the beneficiaries of a will -- afterneglecting to call them for three years.   &quot;Ethics School is ideal for the lawyer who comes ungluedor has a lousy bedside manner,&quot; says William Davis, anassistant trial counsel and unofficial school dean. &quot;Thelawyer who is guilty of misappropriation, lying to a judge,murder, armed robbery -- the things people typically aredisbarred for -- those aren't our candidates.&quot; Mr. Davis, anenthusiast of the program, would like to see it expanded.   Others are skeptical. &quot;It's not clear to me that thisapproach will provide sufficient deterrence, nor is itapparent that it responds adequately to clients, since itprovides no direct remedies to them,&quot; says Deborah Rhode, aprofessor of legal ethics at Stanford Law School.   During the afternoon session, instructor Geri Von Freymanntalks about base barristers. &quot;A lot of lawyers cross the linebetween being an aggressive advocate and an obnoxious twit,&quot;she observes. &quot;We can't help with the ones who are {merely}uncouth. But if there's real overreaching, we step in.&quot;   The class now appears to be listening attentively. It'sjust about 4 p.m., and time for the final exam. Anyone whomisses five or more of the 20 true/false questions won'tpass. Some questions are quite technical, but all have beencovered in class.   A few days later, Mr. Davis reports that everybody passed.Indeed, nobody has ever failed, and there is zero recidivism.He knows, because students are monitored after graduation. Insome cases, the bar has a consulting firm make surprisevisits to check on how grads are doing.   For their efforts, the lawyers get in the mail a fancyEthics School Certificate of Completion, suitable forframing, but not all that likely to be displayed. In fact,many alums specifically request that the envelope be marked&quot;personal and confidential.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
