Rosch; interviews by Michael Zimmerman; edited by MaureenFaustandM;To put the three scanners reviewed on par when evaluating image quality, allwere operated through the same control software, ColorLab I/P from ComputerPresentations Inc. of Cincinnati.andP;  This scanner-control program supports bothSharp scanners and the Howtek Scanmaster and Scanmaster II.andM;With the Sharp scanners, ColorLab delivers more than control: Its manualincludes the GPIB setup information needed to get the scanners operatingproperly -- information that should be included with the scanners.andM;ColorLab works with standard PC hardware -- VGA-plus display adapters thatdeliver 640-by-480-pixel resolution and 256 colors, and IBM's 8514/A adapteron PS/2s to provide 1,024-by-768-pixel resolution.andP;  It uses Windows toachieve system compatibility, and it requires a mouse.andM;Perhaps the best part of ColorLab is its ability to optimally map the 262,144potential colors produced by the scanner onto the 256-color palette of thedisplay system.andM;The $595 program made testing a breeze and would probably speed normal imagescanning as well.andP;  It can save files in its own format or, to allowcommunication with other applications, in the Revision 5.0 TIF format.andP;  --andO;Winn L. RoschandM;The only effective alternative to color scanners is video capture.andP;  Althoughit's much less expensive, video supports lower resolution and fewer colors.andM;While even bottom-of-the-line color scanners deliver resolution as sharp as300 dots per inch, video systems may capture hardly more than 500 dots acrossan entire screen.andP;  Where video is subject to the vagaries of lighting, suchas glare, shadows and color temperature, the internal light sources used byscanners are essentially error-free.andM;No elaborate setup procedure is necessary -- a color scanner requires simplylaying down a sheet and pressing a button or two.andM;-- Winn L.
