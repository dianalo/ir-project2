That would let businesses meetregulations &quot;at the lowest possible cost,&quot; it said.   The memorandum didn't contain any hit list of regulationsthat the White House wants altered or scrapped. Instead, thepresident asked each of the agencies to name a seniorofficial for &quot;permanent regulatory oversight,&quot; and herequested that agencies propose regulations to be altered.Rules &quot;imposing the largest unnecessary burden {should be}the first to be revised or eliminated,&quot; the president said.   Public Citizen, a Washington, D.C., consumer group, saidthe presidential action could block rules that theOccupational Safety and Health Administration was expected toissue soon to limit worker exposure to cadmium, formaldehydeand grain dust, among other substances. David Vladeck, asenior attorney at the Ralph Nader-affiliated group,threatened to sue if the rules are held up because of theregulatory ban.   Although the White House hasn't released a list ofregulations that could be affected, senior aides there havesaid they are especially interested in easing rules regardingtelecommunications and the introduction of geneticallyengineered plants and pesticides.   In his memorandum, Mr. Bush said rules would be exemptfrom the moratorium if they respond to health and safetyemergencies, affect the military, are required by statute orare essential to a criminal investigation. In addition, thepresident said rules could be issued if the agency involvedand the White House Council on Competitiveness determine theywould &quot;foster economic growth.&quot;   The council, headed by Vice President Dan Quayle, ischarged with overseeing the regulatory moratorium and review.</TEXT></DOC>
