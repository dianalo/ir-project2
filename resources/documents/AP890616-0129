About 30people were injured.   Violent clashes between students and riot police broke out oncampuses in Seoul, Kwangju, Taejon, Chonju and Taegu afterprotesters were blocked from marching into the streets, policeofficials said.   Officials estimated about 5,000 students were involved in theprotests of the government of President Roh Tae-woo.   Students, hurling rocks and firebombs, surged out of theirschools after campus rallies, but police did not fire tear gas.   Protesters yelled: ``Punish Roh Tae-woo!'' and ``Down withdictatorship!''   Fierce fighting erupted at Hankuk University in eastern Seoul,where about 2,000 students from seven colleges fought police withmore than 1,000 firebombs. Police hurled back rocks thrown bystudents but did not use tear gas.   About 30 students and police were injured in the two-hour clash,but there were no reports of arrests, police said.   Student leaders called for the overthrow of Roh and demanded thatthey be allowed to take part in a youth festival next month incommunist North Korea. ``March to Pyongyang!'' students chanted asthey beat drums and waved flags.   Students at Hankuk University marched out of the campus andattacked riot police blocking the road with wooden clubs and ironbars. Protesters then attacked with firebombs and several officerswere set ablaze, but the fires were quickly put out by othertroopers.   Protesters knocked down parts of the school's wall and hurled thedebris at police. Police set up iron barricades in the streets tohold students back during the fighting that lasted more than an hour.   The students and allied dissident groups have littlepublicsupport because of their extremist views and violent tactics.   In the southeastern city of Taegu, Roh's hometown, about 50students attacked a government party office with about a dozenfirebombs, destroying windows. Eleven students were arrested.   The fighting marked the second day of widespread campus clashesin Seoul and other cities and indicated radical students hadabandoned a self-imposed ban on firebombs. Major student groups saidthey would stop using the weapons after seven riot police werekilled in a May 3 campus clash.   Student leaders, who refused to be identified, said they had beenforced to use firebombs as self-defense against police attacks. Butthe fighting Friday all appeared to have been started by studentswhen police blocked the marches.   South Korea's government has refused to allow the students totake part in next month's 13th World Youth Festival in North Korea.The two nations are bitter rivals and Seoul has accused North Koreaof inciting the unrest.</TEXT></DOC>
