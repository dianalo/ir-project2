For 1987's fourth quarter, Amax expects to report a gain of $37 million on the transaction.    The metals and minerals concern said it sold the capital stock of its subsidiary, Amax Petroleum Corp., to Delfzee Petroleum B.V., a Dutch company. The properties include two oil and gas producing blocks, one block under development, 10 exploration blocks and interests in related pipeline and gas-plant facilities. Amax said it also expects to receive $13 million as reimbursement for previously incurred expenditures.    A spokesman said Amax wants to concentrate on its oil and gas interests in the U.S., where it has tax-loss carry-forwards that can shelter the company's earnings.    Amax's domestic oil and gas interests are held by Amax Oil andamp; Gas Inc., a Houston subsidiary.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Thursday, Amax shares closed at $20, up 12.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
