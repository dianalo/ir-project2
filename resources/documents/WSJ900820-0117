Changes in the Italian Communist Party, accelerated byevents in Eastern Europe, are fueling speculation amongWestern diplomats and others that Italy's left-leaningparties will form an alliance that will end the politicalstagnation brought on by 40 years of ChristianDemocrat-dominated rule -- perhaps as early as 1995.</LP><TEXT>   A rise of the left hinges in large part on how politicallyrisky the Italian Socialist Party, which forms part of thegovernment's five-party ruling coalition, deems a partnershipwith the Communists -- and whether the Communists, blocked bythe Christian Democrats from cabinet posts, are willing to bethe junior partner in such an association.   And, observers say, the electoral system also would haveto be reformed to reduce the number of Italy's many politicalparties and make it easier for one party or an alliance towin a majority and avoid a coalition government. Under thecurrent &quot;lottizzazione&quot;, or spoils system, ministerial postsand ranking government jobs are divided among the parties ofthe ruling coalition.   Nevertheless, recent events are making the rise of aunited left more possible than ever before.   At the extraordinary Communist Party congress in Bolognain March, more than two-thirds of delegates voted to changethe party's name -- its new label will be decided at anautumn congress. They also voted to drop the hammer andsickle from the party logo and form a new identity. By movingto shake off the trappings of communism, the party is takinga giant leap toward acceptance by the Socialists, who havesaid they would block the Communists' application formembership in the International Socialist and the EuropeanParliament's Socialist groups -- credentials vital to theItalian Communist Party's quest for legitimacy.   In the May regional elections -- the Communists' firstmajor test after the Bologna congress -- the party votedropped to 24% from 30.2% in 1985; that vote was the party'sworst defeat ever. Most of the difference was spread amongother parties. But the Socialists gained only two points from13.3% in 1985.   Says a Western diplomat: &quot;The Socialist Party must do morethan gain two points in five years if it wants the primeministership and major ministries.&quot;   Adds John L. Harper, professor at Johns HopkinsUniversity's Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced InternationalStudies in Bologna: &quot;The Communists and Socialists must nowget down to business, because they're not going anywherealone . . . The Socialists recognize that they're stuck . . .in a political situation . . . with {Prime Minister Giulio}Andreotti and the most conservative faction of the ChristianDemocrat Party.&quot;   Observers also note that the dream of Bettino Craxi,Socialist Party leader and former prime minister, is toreunite the left and correct the Italian Communists'defection in 1921. His long-range strategy is to pull theSocialists out of the government's ruling coalition and leadthe left in overthrowing the Christian Democrats. Theobservers say Mr. Craxi is a passionate man with deeply heldbeliefs about his purpose in life. Those beliefs may beheightened by the 56-year-old's health: Rumors say hisdiabetes is worsening.   Further, the Communist Party's painful, dragged-outmetamorphosis into an acceptable social-democratic partymakes the Socialist strategy less politically risky.   And although there is still much bad blood betweenSocialists and Communists, the tone of the debate betweenthem has become more conciliatory and insults have stopped.   The Communist Party also has put people with technicalcompetence in its shadow cabinet, such as shadow JusticeMinister Stefano Rodota, a professor of civil law at theUniversity of Rome and a member of parliament since 1979; theparty also is pushing practical legislation, a sign that itsleaders are thinking more clearly about coming into power.   Finally, some worry that Italy's economic prosperity can'tlast; they think the left's chances for power will be boostedwhen the economy gets worse.   But observers are careful to note that Communist PartySecretary Achille Occhetto's reconstitution of the party is agamble -- not only for his political career, but also for theparty's very survival.   &quot;If you destroy the Communist identity, what are you leftwith?,&quot; asks Patrick McCarthy, professor at the Johns HopkinsBologna Center. &quot;All the Communists who volunteer for nothing-- are they going to do that for a party they know nothingabout, and that has no history? The hammer and sickle areemotive.&quot;   The Italian Communist Party was born in 1921 when it splitfrom the Italian Socialist Party over policy differences. TheCommunists were instrumental in drafting a postwarconstitution, which established democracy in Italy. With 1.5million members, it is the largest such party in the West.   But even if the Communists and Socialists manage to form apartnership, their declining vote totals would need thesupport of other parties to have a chance to topple theChristian Democrats. Votes from the small Social-Democrat,Republican, Radical and Green parties, however, give such aleft coalition optimistically only about 48% -- not themajority plus a few percentage points needed to gain controlin the Council of Ministers, or cabinet. Some votes surelywould come from Roman Catholics and others who want changebut have been afraid to vote the Communist ballot. Butpolitical experts caution not to exaggerate their number.   Observers also note that the whole &quot;socialist-unity&quot;strategy will fail without electoral reform. Since the end ofWorld War II, vote splits among the Socialists, Communistsand others have allowed the Christian Democrats to dominatein coalition governments. &quot;Prime Minister Andreotti'sstrategy has been to keep the left divided -- to keep theSocialists and Communists apart,&quot; says Prof. Harper.   A movement is afoot, however, to remove Italy'sproportionality system through a referendum. Those seekingchange want an electoral system modeled in part after WestGermany's, in which parties winning less than 5% of the votecan't be represented in parliament. An alternative would beto force the top two vote-getting parties into a runoff.Either move would reduce the electorate's choice and moveItaly toward a two-party system.</TEXT></DOC>
