And according to several private experts, the stance may bejustified.   Not more than two weeks ago, summit planners were confident thatPresident Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev would beable to crown three years of summitry by exchanging the final,fully ratified documents of the INF treaty the superpowers had beennegotiating off and on since 1981.   After all, the pact had run the gantlet of hearings, pastsenators eager to hack away at the treaty, and it emerged with onlya few dents. Head counters expected that only a dozen or sosenators would vote no on final ratification and that the votecould occcur before the summit.   To complete the INF process in time for the Moscow meetingsseemed doubly important because it had become clear that Reagan andGorbachev were still far from reaching their goal of a 30 percentto 50 percent cut in long-range missiles and bombers _ theso-called START agreement.   The leaders would be saying, in essence, ``Well, we've stumbleda bit on START, but let's not dwell on it; signing this final,ratified, INF pact will give us a chance to remind the world we canmake progress on arms control.''   In the past two weeks, however, glitches have emerged in the INFtreaty, mostly over the meaning of verification provisions, and theSenate has decided to postpone ratification work indefinitely. Theadministration is optimistic it will clear away the differences intime for the summit, but that is unlikely to leave the Senate timeto act.   Is the administration worried the failure will hurt the summit?   ``Of course not,'' State Department spokesman Charles E. Redmansaid on Tuesday.   Like other U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity,Redman said the differences between the United States and theSoviets are merely technical and will be resolved. If the Senatefails to act in time for the summit, it can do the work afterwardand the ratification documents can be exchanged later in the year.   The treaty will eliminate ground-launched missiles with rangesbetween 315 miles and 3,125 miles.   Secretary of State George P. Shultz was in Geneva today to meetSoviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze to try to resolvethe INF differences and the administration officials predicted thatif Shultz and his negotiators are willing to shake hands on asettlement, the Senate will go along.   Janusz Bugajski, an expert on Eastern Europe who works at theCenter for Strategic and International Studies, believes that withthe failure of the superpowers to reach agreement on long-rangesystems, the spotlight at the summit will be on human rights andregional issues rather than on arms control.   Theoretically, Gorbachev could try to win propaganda points byraising the Senate's ratification delay as an alleged example ofU.S. hesitancy to end the arms race, Bugajski said.   ``But that's not likely, because Gorbachev wants the summit tobe a success for domestic and international reasons,'' Bugajskisaid.   ``We don't need an INF treaty ratified in time for the summit,we just need it not to be scuttled and that's not going tohappen,'' said Andrew C. Goldberg, a RAND Corp. consultant andexpert on Soviet military affairs.   ``Remember, the vast majority of people in the Senate want toratify the INF treaty eventually,'' Goldberg said.   James T. Hackett, a foreign policy analyst at the conservativeHeritage Foundation, asserted that the Senate's inaction on the INFtreaty reflected members' unease with the treaty despiteoverwhelming constituent support for approval. The last-minutedisagreements over verification ``give them a chance to keepnit-picking so they don't have to ratify it.''   Hackett added: ``Gorbachev wants the summit to show his nationhe is a commanding figure on the world stage. Reagan wants to puton a show to keep his approval rating high for as long as he can.   ``If they can't sign an INF treaty they'll find something elseto do with some pizazz.''</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Henry Gottlieb covers the State Department forThe Associated Press.</TEXT></DOC>
