GRAY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   After 26 years of Buddhist passivityand private grumbling, opponents of Burma's authoritarian regimeare taking to the streets in violent protest.   Since October, students have mobilized demonstrations threetimes, causing deaths, mass arrests and long university closures.Nine people were killed this week in the latest, ongoing streetconfrontations in Rangoon, the Burmese capital, officials said.   The students are demanding release of detainees and legalizationof their unions.   However, Western diplomats in Rangoon and knowledgeable Burmeseobservers say the outbursts reflect deep-rooted disillusionmentwith a regime that has monopolized power for a quarter century.During that time, it has led the resource-rich Southeast Asiannation to economic ruin and isolation.   In an unprecedented admission of failure, strongman U Ne Winlast year called on the state to ``pinpoint the disease'' andlifted controls on the vital rice trade. There was also talk ofconstitutional change but little to indicate Ne Win's party wouldthrow out the basic tenants of his rule: rigid socialist economics,isolationism and single-party control backed by the powerfulmilitary.   ``No real reform has yet been made, although there has been somesmall-scale tinkering with the economy,'' wrote a leading AmericanBurma scholar, Josef Silverstein, recently. ``The economy'sdownward spiral remains unchecked.   Despite the unprecedented surge of opposition, there have beenno predictions so far that anything but old age or ill health willtopple the 78-year-old leader.   While ordinary citizens have joined students in somedemonstrations, there has been no sign of a meaningful andorganized opposition to Ne Win among the military, bureaucracy orinfluential Buddhist monkhood.   The activist students themselves have shown little evidence ofplanning and coordination, although the Rangoon-centered protestshave been touching off minor disturbances elsewhere in the country.   Ne Win, who came to power in a 1962 military coup, has in thepast systematically rooted out opponents and dealt harshly with thefew open protests he faced. Rarely seen in public and neverinterviewed by the press, Ne Win is said to be a superb and highlyintelligent political infighter and a strong nationalist.   But beyond a neutralist foreign policy that has paid dividends,his overall record as national leader is badly marred.   ``He has lost whatever lingering support he may have had. Peoplenow realize the government has never had their interests in mind,''said one Western diplomat in Rangoon last year. He made the commentafter the government took about 60 percent of the kyat currency outof circulation without explanation or compensation.   Burmese in the streets talked of ``official robbery.'' Angrystudents spilled out of their campuses in the first rioting since1974.   Analysts regarded the reaction to the demonetization as awatershed event.   It coincided with a nosedive of the already weak economy thatcontinues even now.   Once the world's largest rice exporter and an oil producer,Burma has suffered spot food shortages and has had to importpetroleum products. Regarded as potentially the richest nations inSoutheast Asia because of its vast natural resources, Burma _ witha per capita annual income of less than $200 _ ranks among theworld's ten poorest nations.   Although the state officially controls much of the economy, ablack market actually accounts for two-thirds or more of thetransactions. The government must spend a third of its budget onfighting a welter of ethnic minorities seeking autonomy and anotherbig chunk on servicing a foreign debt of about $3.5 billion dollars.   Observers have long said that one lid on protest in Burma wasits fertile soil and a low population _ currently about 38 million.   Another widely accepted theory was that Burma's deeply rootedBuddhism fostered an acceptance of suffering as one's ''karma,'' orfate, and deference to authority figures.   A final factor may be Burma's state-imposed isolation from muchof the world. With few real friends and no real enemies, outsidepressures for change have been minimal.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   AP correspondent Denis D.Gray has made ninetrips to Burma over the past decade from Bangkok, the keyBurma-watching post.</TEXT></DOC>
