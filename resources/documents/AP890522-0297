The problem, Christians say, is that a religious state wouldintervene. They noted, for example, that fundamentalist Moslemmilitias forced the American University of Beirut to alter itscourses of study.   The Koran, Islam's holy book, was dropped from a culturalstudies course after the fundamentalists objected its use as onetext among many. They also objected to Christians teaching aboutIslam.   In Egypt, the Moslem-Christian strain starts with the census.Militant Christian Copts claim they number 12 million. Thegovernment sets the number at 3 million. The true figure isbelieved to be around 7 million.   Egypt's Islamic fundamentalist underground occasionally ventsits anger on the Copts, who trace their beginnings to St. Paul inthe year 50.   The Moslem militants who assassinated President Anwar Sadat in1981 were accused of robbing rich Coptic jewellers for funds.   Violence erupted in the Egyptian fundamentalist strongholds ofMinya and Assiut in 1987 after the fundamentalists accused Copts ofspraying crosses on Moslems' clothing.   Copts do attain influential positions in Egypt's government. TheMinister of State for Foreign Affairs, Butros Ghali, and theministers of emigration and international cooperation are Copts.   Their co-religionists have reached high posts in the judiciaryand the army. But none has ever been defense minister orcommander-in-chief.   They also face some legal restrictions. For example, a Copticman can marry a Moslem woman only if he converts to Islam.   ``Copts always have to do things by the back door,'' said oneman who produces and distributes Bible-study videos.   ``Copts feel a certain insecurity,'' said an Egyptian who wouldidentify himself only by his first name, Henein. ``They don't haveeasy access to superior positions.''   The covert discrimination often tips the scales for Christiansdeciding to emigrate.   Turkey has a secular government but bans Christians fromgovernment posts. Christians there said the historical animositybetween the two communities has ebbed, but many high schoolstudents emigrate, leaving behind an increasingly elderly community.   Fewer than 10,000 Christians remain in the old city ofJerusalem, according to church statistics. Some fear it mightshrink to the point of virtual extinction.   ``Christianity might be represented by monuments, buildings andstones rather than by people,'' said the Most Rev. Samir Kafity,Anglican bishop of Jerusalem and the Middle East.   Most Western Christians ``don't realize there's a livingChristian community in the Middle East,'' said Ramy Khoury, apublisher and writer in Amman, Jordan. ``When they come here andsee Christians they're slightly surprised.''   In many Arab countries, Christians try to keep a low profile toavoid trouble.   In Egypt, the head of the Coptic Church, Pope Shenouda III,recently blocked an attempt to form a Coptic political party.   ``Those who want peace and national unity must mesh with theirMoslem brothers,'' he said. ``Establishing a Christian party willcreate negative reactions.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, May 28</NOTE></DOC>
