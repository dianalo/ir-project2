(Cancom) all offer VSAT services.andP;  Youcan obtain the c somplete service from one of these companies, includingleased equipment and access to a satellite, or buy your own dishes and obtainsatellite time separately.andM;The critical step is to decide what type of service you need.andM;A leased line is just that: you lease a connection between points A and B.andO;That line is yours for a fixed monthly rate.andM;Moving informationandM;A packet-switched network is a public facility.andP;  Many customers use it.andO;Insted of lines that belong to particular users, a packet-switched networkprovides connections between many points.andP;  When a customer wants to send dataover the network, the message is broken into packets -- short blocks of data-- which are shipped over the network along with the packets that make upother people's messages, much as a courier's truck is filled with packagesfrom many origins, headed for many destinations.andM;The packet-switched network is an approximate equivalent of the courierservice.andP;  It moves your packets along with other people's packets.andP;  It's themost economical option up to a certain volume, but then the cost of sendingall those packets adds up to more than the cost of a leased line.andM;The analogy is not perfect.andP;  Packet-switched networks carry a monthly accesscharge, which you pay even if you don't use the network at all.andP;  And whileyou can drive your truck where you like, a leased line connects fixed points.andO;For every point with which you want to communicate you need another line.andM;Here's an example.andP;  Dataroute, Telecom Canada's digital data service, willprovide a 9,600-bit-per-second line from Toronto to Vancouver for $3,537 amonth.andP;  That includes a $200 access charge at each end, plus $3,137 for theline itself.andP;  It does not include installation.andM;Telecom's Datapac 300 is a 9,600-bps packet-switching service.andP;  To use itbetween Toronto and Vancouver, you would pay a fixed monthly cost of $830,consisting of a $465 access charge at each end.andP;  You would also pay $1.70 perkilopacket of data.andP;  (A kilopacket is 1,000 packets, and a packet holds up to256 characters.)andM;Jonh Kuhn, general manager of strategic planning at CNCP in Toronto, offers asimple rule of thumb.andP;  &quot;Two hours a day at 9,600 bps is the crossover todedicated lines from X.25 service,&quot; he says.andP;  If a leased line is used twohours or more each day, it is cheaper than a packet-switched network.andM;Although cost is the major factor, there are other considerations.andP;  ClaudeElliot, product manager for Datapac at Telecom Canada, says a packet-switchednetwork can concentrate a number of personal computers or terminals over oneline into a host system, possibly reducing the communications load on thehost.andP;  The network also frees users of some network management concerns.andM;Terrestrial systems are not your only options.andP;  Data can also be sent bysatellite.andP;  Telesat Canada offers two point-to-point satellite data services.andM;Anikom 500 provides a choice of transmission speeds from 56 to 512 kilobitsper second.andP;  On a three-year contract, Telesat charges $4,500 to provide a 56Kbps link between any two points in Canada.andP;  Satellite rates do not vary withdistance -- the satellites are 36,000 kilometres above the equator, so thedistance between endpoints is trivial.andP;  The price includes the use ofsatellite capacity and leasing charges on the satellite dishes at each end.andM;Compare that to $8,025 including access charges for a 24-hour-a-day 56 Kbpsline between Toronto and Montreal, or to $17,583 for the same service fromToronto to Vancouver.andP;  Those rates are CNCP's; Telecom Canada's arecomparable.andP;  However, if you only need 9,600-bps service, a leased line ischeaper, since with satellite you must pay for a minimum of 56 Kbps anyway.andM;Telesaths other point-to-point service, Anikom 1000, provided the 1.544megabits per second capacity known as T1 service, or half-T1 capacity of 772kbps.andP;  Again the rates are distance-insentive.andP;  The monthly cost for apoint-to-point link is about $23,000 for a half-T1 and $39,000 for a T1 link.andO;The choice between Anikom 500 and Anikom 100 depends entirely on the capacityyou require, according to Ivan Nakamoto, Telesat's product manager for bothservices.andM;Both these services are best suited to linking two points.andP;  If you want tocommunicate among three or four locations, you still only need one dish ateach location, but the discount for multiple links is small.andP;  As the numberof locations grows, VSAT looks more attractive as long as the volumes to bebandled are not too large.andM;VSAT communication uses small (1.8 metres) satellite dishes at mostlocations, with all communications routed through a central hub.andP;  It workswell if you want many branch locations to communicate with a central office.andO;VSAT costs from $750 to $1,500 per month per location, depending mainly onthe volume of data.andM;VSAT earth stations cost $20,000 to $25,000 apiece, but can also be leased.andO;A hub station costs from $1.5 million to $2 million, but only a user withhundreds of locations would want its own hub.andM;CNCP charges $80 per month per station for connection to its VSAT network,and 75 cents per kilopacket of data.andP;  Dan Hector, director of satelliteservices at CNCP, says a low-volume site might cost $700 a month, ahigher-volume one $800 to $900.andP;  Donald Witzel, product manager for Telesat'sAnikom 200 VSAT service, says monthly costs start at about $650.andP;  ThomasMoorehead, vice-president of Cancom, says a VSAT package from Cancom costsabout $1,200 a month per location, including leased dishes, while a customerwith its own dishes would pay about $600 per location.andM;Response time may be a problem with satellites.andP;  No signal moves instantlyfrom A To B, but even between Halifax and Vancouver the delay isimperceptible.andP;  The 72,000-kilometre bounce off a satellite, however, takesabout half a second.andP;  That matters little for sending large files, providedyour communication protocol tolerates the delay.andP;  In a real-time, interactivesystems, however, the delay may be unacceptable.andM;Another issue is reliability.andP;  Every communication technology has its ownAchilles heel.andP;  Underground cables can be torn up by bulldozers -- about halfthe communications capacity between Toronto and Eastern Canada was lost formost of a day last July when workmen repairing a bridge cut a fibre-opticcable.andP;  Undersea cables are frequently damaged by fishing trawlers.andP;  Andsatellite communication is afected by sunspots, solar disturbances affectingthe earth's magnetic field.andM;Puzzling over these options, you may envy the telephone user who has fewerchoices.andP;  There is no one right answer, but it's important to do yourhomework if you're going to make the right call.andM;Grant Buckler is a Toronto-based freelance writer.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
