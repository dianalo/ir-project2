Still, inthis second part of the series ``City Faces, City Fears,'' thejurist who grew up in the inner city says he cannot let his``sorrow and pity'' cloud the tough judgments he must make.   ---</TEXT><BYLINE>By SHARON COHEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   It's late morning in Judge Earl Strayhorn'schambers and today's topic is wasted lives. One young man is deadin a shooting over drugs. Another, a 19-year-old gang member, willpay for the crime.   Now it's bargaining time.   The 19-year-old's lawyer pleads for mercy. The prosecutor talksof murder. Then the judge makes his offer: 20 years, take it orleave it.   Minutes later, the boyish cocaine dealer, jaw jutting, headcocked back defiantly, pleads guilty to murder. His mother,straining to hear in the court's front row, cups her tearful facein her hands. As she leaves, she's comforted by a youth whoseT-shirt has a moniker on the back: ``Killer.''   So goes another day in the Cook County courts, another day wheredreams die, where mothers cry, where the strangest and saddeststories are told, where a few words from the honorable EarlStrayhorn can mean life or death.   ``Yes, this IS justice,'' the judge says of the five-minutebargaining session he estimates saved seven trial days. ``He's notwalking away with a slap on the wrist. Twenty years ain't choppedliver. The penitentiary is not a country club.''   For almost 20 years, Strayhorn has judged the crimes andmisdemeanors of urban America. This tart-tongued veteran of thenation's largest court system says he's a pragmatist, not adreamy-eyed crusader out to right every wrong.   ``I am NOT society's avenging angel,'' he declares. ``I am NOTsitting in order to act as the conscience of society and to imposethe horrible wrath of the Lord on people who commit horriblecrimes.''   And he has heard his share: the teen who threw her baby down agarbage chute into a compacter, the guy who axed his grandmother todeath, the man who hacked off his lover's head and toes and mailedthem.   ``Life in this day and age is cheaper than a piece of meat inthe meat market,'' Strayhorn says. ``People will haggle over thecost of steak more than they will consider the worth of a humanlife.   ``I cope with that. But,'' he adds slowly, ``I never get used toit.''   In fact, Strayhorn believes the world has turned harsher sincehe first donned black robes: more vicious crimes, more drug use,younger offenders.   But this man who has climbed the steps of the Depression-eracriminal courts building for 42 of his 72 years, as a prosecutor,defense attorney and now judge, decided long ago not to allow thecruelty eat him up.   ``I put a shield on. I don't let it get behind that shield,'' hesays, sitting in his chambers, lined with awards, memorabilia andphotos of his wife, lawyer-son, doctor-daughter and grandchild.   Strayhorn disposes of 500 to 550 cases a year, about 60 percentin pleas or bench trials. In 1989, 28,647 felony cases were filedin the county's criminal division, more than triple the number of adecade earlier, officials say. An estimated 75 percent were tied todrugs.   Strayhorn says being a black raised in Chicago - he now lives a15-minute drive from work - better prepared him to be a judge: Heunderstands the environment and experiences of many who becomecourt statistics.   But when the white-haired, bespectacled judge takes the bench inhis cavernous marble and wood courtroom, he's no soft touch.   ``Why are you wearing that junk?'' he snaps at a bearded drugoffender whose earring he takes as a sign of gang membership.``When you come into court, you better take it out. You're caughtwith them, their dirt is going to spill over on you and I'm goingto send you to the penitentiary. Do you understand?''   A suspected burglar fares no better. His lawyer wants his bondreduced, arguing that he supports four children. Strayhorn asks howmuch he gives the mother each week and questions his claim that ajob's waiting. The man mumbles a confused answer.   Strayhorn interrupts, snarling at the lawyer: ``Don't make himlie. Tell him to SHUT UP.... That's why he's here. He's a liar!''   ``You can't put anything over on the guy,'' says Jack Murphy, aprosecutor. ``He's seen it all. He's heard it all.''   But Strayhorn has a lighter side, too. He teases a baldinglawyer: ``This case has got all the hair on it you lost off yourhead.'' He needles another, ``You're starting off on the short endof the stick. This one happened in my neighborhood.''   And at a civil marriage ceremony for a jail inmate, Strayhornsuddenly looks up from his paperwork and barks: ``Hey, man, kissher!''   After a generation on the bench, Strayhorn says punishmentremains the toughest part of the job.   He has imposed the death penalty twice, though he morallyopposes it, and once sentenced a gang rapist to 125 years,prompting the man to retort: ``I hope you croak in bed tonight.''   But he also acknowledges he probably gives more probation thanother judges - in about 85 percent of his cases.   ``My probation is harder to do than doing time,'' he argues.``You have to use some self-discipline. ...That's punishment,particularly when they know what they've got hanging over theirhead is a big sword.   ``If I send this malleable kid down to the penitentiary, allhe's going to learn down there is how to be a bigger, worsecrook,'' he adds.   When ordering probation, Strayhorn always tells criminals whattheir prison sentences will be if they violate it. He gives nosecond chances.   ``I'm arrogant,'' he says. ``I have confidence in myself. I feelI'm better than most and as good as the best.''   Still, he says, ``not a day goes by that I don't remember that Iam black and being a judge really hasn't changed that.''   It becomes a theme when he speaks to groups of young people.   ``When does a black person become a nigger in our society?'' hesays he asks such groups. ``And their eyes widen and then somebodysays, `I don't know, when?' I say, `When you leave the room.' ''   ``The moral of the story ... I know I'm good, but I'm stillblack. That means I'm not going to receive the benefit of beinggood merely because I have been good. I'm going to have to besomething more.''   Strayhorn says he knows racism and other urban ills often arefactors in crimes. That doesn't sway him.   ``All I can do is put a Band-Aid on the cancer,'' he says. ``IfI allow my sorrow and my pity and my understanding that there is anexplainable reason this person is just a step above an animal, if Iallow the feeling to outweigh my judgment, I'm not going to be agood judge.''   ---   EDITOR'S NOTE - Sharon Cohen is the AP Midwest regionalreporter, based in Chicago.</TEXT></DOC>
