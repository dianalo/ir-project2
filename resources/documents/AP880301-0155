(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A sting operation caught 52 suspects whoallegedly operated a $100 million poaching ring which dealt intiger, bear, sea lion and rhinoceros parts, state officialsannounced Tuesday.   Surrounded by bear gall bladders, bear-claw jewelry, skin parts,whole stuffed bears, skulls, dried abalone and the genitalia ofseals and Asian tigers, regional game warden chief Chuck Monroesaid the investigation helped to ``wipe out the poaching ofCalifornia's precious wildlife.''   An additional 23 people in Southern California are expected tobe charged as a result of ``Operation Ursus,'' the code name giventhe 23-month probe by the state Department of Fish and Game.   Many of the animal parts were sold to Asians who regard them asaphrodisiacs and tonics, he said.   At one point, an undercover warden taking part in an illegal``safari'' in the Sierra was forced to kill a treed bear, Monroesaid as he described the complexity and danger of the probe.   Monroe said 74 misdemeanor complaints were filed against 52defendants. The charges range from illegally killing bears toselling bear-claw jewelry at swap meets.   So far, Monroe said, agents have made 14 arrests and obtainedthree search warrants. Those convicted of poaching can draw stifffines and prison sentences, according to Monroe.   The display in the council chamber at Colma City Hall, justsouth of San Francisco, represented $85,000 worth of exotic animalsand organs seized in the sting, he said.   The probe extended from the black bear range of NorthernCalifornia to San Francisco and Los Angeles, with the arrests madeover two months, said Monroe.   He singled out the Yau Hing Apothecary Ship in San Francisco,object of a search that yielded ``bear galls, mounted bears, sealand tiger penises, abalone, rhino horn and powder.''   The probe recovered parts of animals taken outside the countryand illegally shipped here, he said.   Russian bear gall bladders were sold in two cases, but oneturned out to be from a cow, he said. The bear parts are purchasedmainly by Asians who believe eating the organs will transfer thebear's strength, health and courage.   ``Northern California arrests included a Weaverville man forfelony sale of 25 wet bear galls and five skulls; a Fresno artdealer for felony sale of bear-claw rings and pendants; a San Brunoexotic meat dealer for sale of bear hams, galls, skin and otherbear and tiger parts, and a San Bruno taxidermist for sale of abear rug and skull,'' said Monroe.   In describing the illegal safari, Monroe said the undercoverwarden was included in the party after passing himself off as agame hunter.   ``He had been with them on several hunts,'' Monroe said. ``Whenthe bear was treed, the agent was with three outlaws, all of whomwere armed. The time was 1 a.m. in a remote and steep forest. If hehad refused to kill the bear, they surely would have suspected whohe really was and his life would have been in danger.''   Prior approval had been given for the killing ``if it becamenecessary,'' said Monroe.   ``Although we regret the loss of the bear, we hope its sacrificewill prevent the loss of many other bears in the future,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
