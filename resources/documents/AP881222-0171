And cannibalization of some warheads to build or upgrade othersis something ``that we must look at to keep our options open,''Herrington said in a speech at the National Press Club.   But as things now stand, ``I do not anticipate the need'' toresort to such methods.   Tritium, used in thermonuclear weapons and as a booster in someplutonium-powered weapons, decays rapidly and must be replenishedfrom time to time in bombs or warheads. Half of any amount oftritium becomes inert helium in 12.6 years.   Tritium has been made in three nuclear reactors at thedepartment's Savannah River plant in South Carolina _ reactors thathave been closed for safety upgrading since last summer or earlier.   Herrington has said it will be spring or summer before thereactors can be restarted, and there have been some estimates thatproduction could not be resumed until the end of the year.   An advisory committee has refused to approve the department'srestart plans, and Herrington disclosed that he had accepted thepanel's recommendation in one principal area of concern.   Piping at the three reactors will be subjected to ultrasonictests for cracks, he said.   Asked after his speech how much time those examinations might addto preparations for restarting the reactors, Herrington said: ``Idon't know. It depends on what we find.''   The recommendation, he said, ``is reasonable, and I had prettymuch concluded myself that we ought to do it.''   In recent weeks, cracks have been discovered on piping of two ofthe reactors. A headquarters team has been in Savannah River thisweek assessing the significance of those findings.   Herrington has been granted an additional $900 million fornuclear waste cleanup activities in the budget being submitted toCongress next month, but the White House turned him down for $360million more, ordering him to use unspent departmental funds tobridge the gap.   ``We are still working inside the department'' to figure out howthat will be done,'' he said.   ``The amount of money being given to us is reasonable and a goodstart,'' he said. ``I do not say that without saying this: There aregoing to be some hard choices,'' and the Bush administration willhave to review Reagan's budget decisions.   Herrington has estimated that $110 billion will be necessary toclean up weapons plant waste over the next 40 years, and some otherestimates range up to $170 billion.   Asked if the press had fallen down in not spotlightingenvironmental and safety concerns before, Herrington said, ``On thelocal level, the press has been extremely diligent'' in followingcongressional developments, hearing testimony and congressionalreports for almost four years.   But it probably took an unexplained power surge at one of theSavannah River reactors last August to draw national attention, hesaid.   On civilian subjects, Herrington said it was ``an outrage'' thatthe nation had two completed but unused nuclear power plants in anarea vulnerable to electricity brownouts, the Seabrook plant in NewHampshire and the Shoreham plant on New York's Long Island.   ``I speak as a citizen concerned about energy independence, as ataxpayer concerned that New York is going to issue tax-free bonds tobuy the plant and tear it down.   The plants would replace oil-burning plants, help counter the``greenhouse effect'' global warming that results from fossil fueluse and help reduce emissions of pollutants that cause acid rain, hesaid.   ``I think it's an outrage. I want to see those plants operate.... I guarantee you, if we don't turn this around we will beimporting Japanese reactors.''   The two plants have been unable to win federal approval ofemergency evacuation plans because of opposition from stategovernments _ the Massachusetts government in the case of the NewHampshire plant.   But the staff of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission hasrecommended approval of a 25 percent power license for Shoreham, andmay grant a testing license to Seabrook in the next several weeks. </TEXT></DOC>
