Gorbachev during their summit talks Saturday tohalt the flow of Soviet weapons to rebels in El Salvador, but U.S.officials said the issue was not resolved.   Gorbachev, according to the officials, said he did not know howthe arms get to the Central American country.   The United States alleges that the weapons, including Sovietanti-aircraft launchers, are channeled through the leftistgovernments of Cuba and Nicaragua. A plane that crashed lastweekend in El Salvador carried a cache of Soviet weapons, the StateDepartment charged.   U.S. officials at the summit, declining to be identified, calledthe dispute the biggest stumbling block to a further improvement insuperpower relations.   Secretary of State James A. Baker last week denounced theweapons flow as a ``relic of the Cold War.''   He had taken the issue up in September with Soviet ForeignMinister Eduard A . Shevardnadze in Jackson Hole, Wyo. The Sovietspromised at that time to stop direct deliveries and to try to stemthe flow, U.S. officials said.   The Salavadoran rebels are using the arms in their war against aU.S.-backed, right-wing government.   The Bush administration, meanwhile, refuses to stop providingweapons to rebels fighting a Marxist government in Afghanistan. TheState Department has ruled out a tradeoff with Moscow haltingSoviet arms for Salvadoran rebels and U.S. arms to the Afghans.</TEXT></DOC>
