The successful implementationof any life extension program, however, requires an evaluation of thephysical condition of the various components in a power plant. This paperdescribes a program for the evaluation of high-energy piping systemsin fossil-fueled and nuclear power plants. This program is an exampleof EPRI's phased engineering approach to life extension evaluations.Recent piping failures at the Mohave, Monroe, and Surry power plantsare reminders of the obvious safety concerns that need to be addressedin a physical assessment program. Other types of failures have occurred,however, that while not as widely publicized, resulted in either a forcedoutage, a longer planned outage, or maintenance problems with attachedequipment. In addition to addressing the more obvious safety concerns,a piping evaluation program should maintain or improve plant availability.</TEXT></DOC>
