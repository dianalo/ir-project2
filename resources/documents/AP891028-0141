Baker III hasagreed to modify Washington's Middle East peace proposal to make itmore acceptable to Israel, Israel radio reported Saturday.   It said Baker made the changes following a week of intensivecontacts with Foreign Minister Moshe Arens.   A Foreign Ministry spokesman declined comment on the radioreport. He said Arens sent a letter to Baker last week acceptingthe U.S. plan in principle but asking for minor changes.   Neither the spokesman nor Israel Radio gave details about thepurported changes.   In other developments:   _ Peace activist Abie Nathan, jailed for meeting with PalestineLiberation Organization chief Yasser Arafat, told a legislator hehad rejected an offer of a pardon if he expressed remorse formeeting with PLO officials.   _ Masked Palestinians stabbed to death a 42-year-old Palestinianwoman suspected of collaborating with Israel.   _ Israeli troops opened fire during clashes in the occupied GazaStrip and West Bank, killing one Palestinian and wounding 15.   At least 606 Arabs have been killed during the 22-month-oldPalestinian uprising against the Israeli occpuation of the WestBank and Gaza Strip. Another 137 Palestinians have been slain byfellow Arabs on suspicion of cooperating with Israeli authorities.Forty Israelis also have perished in the violence.   Arens, in his letter to Baker, urged the U.S. peace plan bechanged to drop Cairo, Egypt, as the site for preliminaryIsraeli-Palestinian talks and to bar Palestinians deported byIsrael from participating in the negotiations.   He also insisted that the talks be limited to discussingIsrael's election plan for the West Bank and Gaza Strip and notinclude Palestinian demands for an independent state.   The Israeli plan calls for elections and limited autonomy in theoccupied territories.   Baker proposed an Israeli-Palestinian meeting in Cairo todiscuss the election offer and specified that the Palestiniandelegation could discuss other political issues. He also did notrule out the participation of Palestinians expelled from theirhomeland by Israel.   The Israeli Cabinet has rejected a suggestion by EgyptianPresident Hosni Mubarak that Israeli and Palestinian delegates meetin Cairo with the Palestinian members to include two deportees withlinks to the PLO.   Peace crusader Nathan was convicted Sept. 27 of meeting withAfafat and other PLO officials in Tunisia and France in September1988 and was sentenced to six months in prison. Israel'santi-terror law prohibits meetings with members of terroristorganizations, and Israel considers the PLO such a group.   Nathan entered the Eyal prison near Tel Aviv three weeks ago tobegin serving the sentence.   Legislator Yossi Sarid of the leftist Citizens Rights Movementvisited Nathan Saturday and said later that officials had offeredto arrange a pardon.   ``They let it be known that if he will express regret formeeting with Arafat and if he promises not to do it again, he willbe granted a pardon,'' Sarid told The Associated Press.   He reported Nathan said he told the officials, who he did notidentify, that the offer was ``totally unacceptable.''   ``He has no regrets about what he has done,'' Sarid said.   Justice Department spokeswoman Etti Eshed said the ministry hasnot considered asking President Chaim Herzog to pardon Nathan ``andI don't know where this allegation is coming from.''   Arab reporters said that in the West Bank town of Nablus fivemasked youths entered the house of Rasmiyya al-Banna and slashedher face and neck with knives and pieces of broken glass. They saidshe was accused of collaborating with Israel and died of the woundsat Rashidiyya hospital.   Israel television said Jihad Sabah Ghenamad, 18, was shot andkilled by Israeli troops during a street battle in the the WestBank village of Surif.   Arab reporters and hospital sources said 15 Palestinians wereshot and wounded by troops in scattered clashes in the Gaza Strip.</TEXT></DOC>
