Points to be discussed are:The integration of NF smelters in international division of labour increasingavailability of low-priced hydroelectric power abroad, and finally thespecific German causes for energy price increases. - The following questionis emerging: What will be the future position of smelters, after expirationof present long-term price agreements for electric power? The answershould essentially be given by both metal and power producers. Smeltersmust make extreme efforts at cost reduction, and they will have to renouncecertain operational improvements which, though technologically desirableare too costly. - Power suppliers, on the other hand, should be flexiblein finding unconventional solutions, in view of the fact that smeltersare so closely associated with the world market. While basic load capacities- whether in Germany or in the EC - are not fully utilized, the continuedoperation of smelters should be beneficial for either party, metal companiesand energy suppliers, and thus be commercially viable and hence meaningful.- To find ad-hoc solutions is a way to avoid discussion on the marketorder for electricity which in principle is legitimate. Smelters accepttheir place in a global economic system based on division of labour andcompetition. They do not advocate subsidies or protectionism. There isgood reason to hope that a fair number of smelters will survive in the90-ties.</TEXT></DOC>
