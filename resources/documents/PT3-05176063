According to the invention, one of the two seats of the valve      consists of the end of a sleeve (30) coaxial with the plunger (12), a      prestressed compressible mechanism (32) tending to shift the sleeve (30)      and plunger (12) axially away from one another, the sleeve (30) coming      axially up against one end of a piece (36) fixed to the control rod (10)      after the relative positions have been set. </PAL></ABST><BSUM> <PAR>  The invention relates to brake-boosters and applies more particularly to      the adjustment of the jump of such boosters. </PAR><PAR>  A brake-booster generally comprises a control rod which is displaced      forwards when the vehicle driver actuates the brake pedal. This      displacement of the control rod is transmitted to a plunger which actuates      boost means. In general, these boost means comprise a two-seat three-way      valve, the actuation of which makes it possible to interrupt communication      between a front chamber and a rear chamber of the booster and to connect      the latter chamber to the atmosphere. Because the front chamber is      normally under a vacuum, a boost force is thus exerted on the piston      separating the two chambers. The piston is then displaced forwards, at the      same time acting on a push rod serving for actuating the master cylinder      of the brake circuit. </PAR><PAR>  The piston serving for transmitting the boost force to the push rod acts on      the latter via a reaction disk produced from a deformable material, such      as an elastomer. At rest, a small play is present between the front end of      the plunger and the reaction disk. When the vehicle driver begins to      actuate the brake pedal, this small play allows the plunger to be      displaced forwards immediately in order to control the boost means and      ensure an immediate response of the brakes. </PAR><PAR>  The effect of transmitting the boost force exerted on the piston to the      push rod via the reaction disk is to compress the peripheral part of the      reaction disk axially in proportion to the boost force. This compression      of the peripheral part of the reaction disk results in a deformation of      the central part of this disk towards the front face of the plunger. When      the boost force exceeds a particular threshold, the play initially present      at rest between the reaction disk and the front face of the plunger is      taken up, so that the plunger is in contact with the reaction disk and the      latter returns toward the brake pedal a reaction force representing the      braking force applied to the brakes of the vehicle. This well-known      arrangement enables the driver to meter the braking force which he exerts      on the pedal as a function of the resistance which he encounters and which      increases with this force. </PAR><PAR>  It emerges from the foregoing explanation that the pedal reaction begins to      appear only when the boost force generated as a result of the actuation of      the brake pedal exceeds a particular threshold. This threshold is called      the &quot;jump&quot; of the booster. It is an important characteristic of the      booster. In fact, although it is necessary for the jump to exist in order      to ensure an immediate response of the brakes whenever the pedal is      actuated, motor-vehicle manufacturers will generally like the value of      this jump to remain within particular limits so that the boost does not      reach too high a value without an increase in the pedal reaction. </PAR><PAR>  However, particularly in view of the production tolerances of the various      component parts of the booster, there can be considerable differences in      the value of the jump from one booster to another. Likewise, the master      cylinders intended to be actuated by the push rod of the booster      themselves suffer from a spread of their characteristics, with the result      that the performances of a brake-booster/master-cylinder assembly can vary      within an extremely wide range. Moreover, at the present time there is no      practical means for controlling or adjusting the value of the jump of the      booster, and therefore the abovementioned requirements are not always      satisfied, unless complex checks involving a high outlay are conducted. </PAR><PAR>  The document FR-A-2,480,898 provides a process for adjusting the value of      the jump of each booster. This costly process has to be carried out before      the assembly of the booster and therefore cannot allow for the production      tolerances of the various component parts of the booster. </PAR><PAR>  One object of the present invention is to overcome the abovementioned      disadvantages with a booster, of which the adjustment of the jump can be      carried out after the complete assembly of the booster. </PAR><PAR>  Another object of the invention is to provide such a process for adjusting      the jump. </PAR><PAR>  The invention therefore applies to a pneumatic brake-booster comprising, in      series, a control rod substantially fixed relative to a plunger by a pivot      means, a reaction disk and a push rod, the control rod actuating a      two-seat three-way valve, and a space being provided at rest between the      reaction disk and the plunger for determining the jump. </PAR><PAR>  According to the invention, one of the two seats of the valve consists of a      sleeve coaxial with the plunger, a prestressed compressible means tending      to shift the sleeve and plunger axially away from one another, the sleeve      coming axially up against a piece fixed to the control rod, after the      relative positions have been set. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAR>  The invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the      accompanying drawings in which: </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 1 shows a pneumatic booster according to the invention      diagrammatically in section, and </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 shows a variant of the embodiment of FIG. 1. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAR>  Referring now to FIG. 1, an average person skilled in the art will      recognise the control rod 10 actuated by a pedal (not shown). This control      rod 10 is fixed to a plunger 12 by a pivot means 14 allowing some offset      of the control rod 10. </PAR><PAR>  The plunger 12 is located opposite one face of the reaction disk 16, onto      the other face of which is laid the push rod 18 actuating the piston of      the master cylinder (not shown). The jump is determined by the space      provided between the reaction disk 16 and the opposite end of the plunger      12. </PAR><PAR>  Conventionally, the booster comprises a two-seat three-way valve consisting      of a diaphragm 20, on which a spring 22 bears, and of two seats. </PAR><PAR>  The first seat 24, when the diaphragm 20 rests on it, interrupts      communication between a front chamber of the booster connected permanently      to a vacuum source and a rear chamber. </PAR><PAR>  The second seat 26, when the diaphragm 20 rests on it, interrupts      communication between the ambient air and the rear chamber. The      functioning of the valve is well known and will not be repeated in detail      here. </PAR><PAR>  According to the embodiment of FIG. 1, this second seat 26 consists of the      end of a cylindrical sleeve 30 arranged around the plunger 12. A spring 32      tends to shift the sleeve 30 and plunger 12 away from one another. This      spring can be replaced by a plastic ring performing the same function. </PAR><PAR>  The sleeve 30 comes axially with a dog 34 up against one end of a      substantially cylindrical piece 36 fixed to the control rod 10, after the      relative positions of the components have been set. </PAR><PAR>  This dog 34 and the end of the piece 36 assume a partially spherical shape      substantially of the same center as that of the pivot means 14, in order      to benefit the possibility of the abovementioned offset of the control rod      10. </PAR><PAR>  The adjustment of the desired jump is obtained in the following way. </PAR><PAR>  In a first step, the components of the booster are assembled, but the      control rod 10 is not fixed to the piece 36. Thus, the plunger 12 and the      sleeve 30 can slide axially relative to one another under the effect of      the spring 32. </PAR><PAR>  The two valve seats 24, 26 are then placed in the same radial plane as a      result of the axial displacement of the piece 36, of which the position in      relation to the body of the booster is then fixed. </PAR><PAR>  Subsequently, by the axial displacement of the control rod 10, the space      provided between the reaction disk 16 and the plunger 12, that is to say      the jump of the booster, can be adjusted. When the desired jump is      obtained, the piece 36 and the control rod 10 are fixed relative to one      another by any means, such as crimping 38. The spring 32 then no longer      has any effect. This ensures an exact adjustment of the jump after the      assembly of the booster, without the need to provide complex and costly      means. Furthermore, the setting of the jump is carried out in a unitary      manner, that is to say the jump obtained is completely independent of all      the production tolerances of the booster. Finally, this adjustment is made      from outside the booster and does not require its dismounting. </PAR><PAR>  Referring to FIG. 2, a variant of the embodiment described above has been      represented. On that FIG. 2, the elements identical or similar to those of      FIG. 1 have been given the same reference numerals. It can be seen on FIG.      2 that the second seat 26 consists of the end of a cylindrical sleeve 30      arranged within the plunger 12, the spring 32 tending to shift them away      from one another in order that the surface 34 of the sleeve 30 interacts      with the end of the piece 36 partially spherically shaped, as previously      described. The adjustment of the booster of FIG. 2 is obtained in exactly      the same way as that of FIG. 1. </PAR><PAR>  Of course, an average person skilled in the art can make many changes to      the invention, without departing from the scope defined by the      accompanying claims. For example, as shown on FIG. 2, it can be provided      that the piece 36 be forced onto the control rod 10 by way of a knurling      38' on the control rod 10, making the crimping 38 optional. </PAR><PAR>  Finally, it should be noted that, for example by the used of a tilting stop      key, the invention makes it possible to adjust the idle travel of the      booster after the assembly of the latter. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  We claim: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
