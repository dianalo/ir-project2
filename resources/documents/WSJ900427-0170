Sesit and Barbara Toman   Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>04/27/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE C9</SO><CO>   J.NOM</CO><IN>MEDIA, PUBLISHING, BROADCASTING, ELECTRONIC PUBLISHING (MED)SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR)</IN><LP>   Nomura Securities Co. filed a libel suit in London againstthe author and the publisher of a book that it claims depictsthe world's largest brokerage firm as engaging in variousimproper securities practices.   The suit claims that &quot;The House of Nomura, The Rise toSupremacy of the World's Most Powerful Company&quot; by Albert J.Alletzhauser falsely depicts Nomura as engaging in insidertrading, lying to and cheating clients and manipulating theJapanese stock market.</LP><TEXT>   The suit also contends that the book libeled Nomura byportraying the Japanese firm as using confidentialinformation to benefit its senior staff, training its salesforce to psychologically pressure vulnerable clients, andpaying money to gangsters, extortionists and blackmailers tocover up illegal acts.   The suit, filed Wednesday in the High Court of Justice,Queens Bench Division, seeks an injunction to restrain Mr.Alletzhauser and the publisher, Bloomsbury Publishing Ltd.,from publishing or repeating the &quot;said or any similarlibels.&quot;   The book was published in mid-January in Britain.Bloomsbury says it was the No. 1 best seller in Britain inearly February. It is scheduled to be released in the U.S.and Japan next month.   Some Nomura executives worry that the publicitysurrounding the case could hurt the company, especially at atime when there is considerable tension between Japan and theWest over the growing influence of Japanese financialinstitutions around the world.   &quot;I feel this is a major mistake,&quot; said one Nomuraexecutive. Some executives in New York and London areespecially puzzled by it, particularly since the book waspublished several months ago, and presumably sales would beexpected to have slackened off with time.   But Yoshihisa Tabuchi, Nomura's president, said in Tokyolast week that if Nomura failed to take any action againstthe book, it would have &quot;meant Nomura admitted the existence&quot;of illegal acts that he says are described in the book.   Some Nomura employees speculate that the firm may behoping to stop publication in the bigger Japanese and U.S.markets and deter other potentially critical books on thefirm from being published. One Nomura executive said thatNomura's British lawyers, Linklaters andamp; Paines, even advisedagainst bringing action.   In late February, lawyers for Nomura in London wrote toMr. Alletzhauser and his publisher, threatening to sue themunless they agreed to immediately pull the book off themarket, paid damages, made a public apology and agreed not todisseminate any further &quot;defamatory statements concerningNomura.&quot;   In subsequent negotiations, Nomura's lawyers said thecompany was willing to drop the threatened suit if the authormade certain changes in the book, Mr. Alletzhauser said in aninterview. He and the publisher countered with an offer tolet Nomura &quot;put an errata sheet in back of each future copysold in the U.K. explaining what they found was wrong,&quot; Mr.Alletzhauser said. &quot;They rejected my offer,&quot; he said.   Mr. Alletzhauser said that he never defamed Nomura. &quot;Forthem to be suing me is out of character with the nature ofthe book. It was written as a history of the firm and notmeant to be combative at all,&quot; he said.   British libel law is much stricter than its Americancounterpart. In the U.S., writers charged with libel againstpublic figures needn't prove that any defamatory statementsare true. Libel defendants merely need to show that they werereasonably careful to check facts. But in England, writersordinarily must prove the truth of any factual allegationsthey make. And writers making defamatory comments -- forexample, suggesting someone isn't fit to hold a certain job-- must prove in court a factual basis for the comments.   Mr. Alletzhauser, 30 years old, is an American living inLondon. He is a principal of Tiedemann InternationalResearch, a London-based stockbrokerage firm.</TEXT></DOC>
