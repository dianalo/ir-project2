Emergency medical service ``for certainly more than half theUnited States ... ranges from deep trouble to critical butstable,'' said Jack Stout, a Miami consultant who has designedambulance systems in six cities.   ``EMS is some of the nation's largest cities is in criticalcondition. Absolutely critical. They're out of control or brokendown,'' said James Page, chief of the Monterey Park, Calif., firedepartment, which handles ambulance runs, and publisher of theJournal of Emergency Medical Services.   Emergency care has improved dramatically from the 1960s whenbroken bodies were simply scooped off the pavement and whisked tothe nearest hospital, without thought to on-site care. Giventoday's capabilities, however, deaths from injury and heart attackare considered unacceptably high.   Quality and control have fallen off with a drop in federalmoney, lack of federal oversight and haphazard training, accordingto some critics. Too many systems are plagued by mismanagement,inefficiency, poor design and simple mistakes.   One tipoff to a troubled system is access. Less than half theU.S. population can get an ambulance by dialing 911. Others mustknow the exact department or agency to call. Britain has used a 999number since 1930.   A properly organized and equipped national EMS system couldprevent 30,000 heart attack deaths and 25,000 deaths by injury eachyear, according to estimates by the National Academy of Sciences.   ``We're killing more of our own citizens in a year than werekilled in all of Vietnam,'' said James Hitlin, a former paramedicin Florida and a lobbyist for a bill to promote a national EMSprogram. ``We're forfeiting lives because of disorganization.''   A spot check of ambulance service in major cities by TheAssociated Press found:   _In Washington, D.C., a man who suffered a seizure Jan. 17waited 38 minutes for a lost ambulance. His family finally drovehim to a hospital, where he died. Callers to 911 in the capitalcity sometimes get a recorded message. Ambulances routinely take 30minutes to arrive.   _In New York City, where 100 ambulances are dispatched everyhour, two paramedics were disciplined for waiting for theirsandwiches in a deli despite a call to help a man dying from aheart attack less than two blocks away Feb. 17. Last August, a70-year-old woman died of heart failure after a two-hour wait foran ambulance and three calls to EMS by friends and relatives.Officials blamed a dispatching mixup and a shortage of units forthe delay.   On the other hand:   _In Tulsa, Okla., a computer knows in an instant the ambulancenearest an emergency; instead of being parked at a station house,each vehicle moves around under guidance of the computer, whichcalculates when and where accidents and heart attacks are apt tohappen. Radar tracks the ambulance, shown as a magenta blip on a30-inch electronic screen, so it can't get lost. Ambulances mustrespond in 8 minutes 90 percent of the time or the private companythat runs the service is fined.   _Seattle draws praise for its life-saving rate. Fire departmentparamedics revive half the 300 people who suffer heart attacks eachyear, giving them a chance to make it to a hospital. About 80 ofthose 150 recover completely. Citizens also get involved.Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation is mandatory in King County schoolsand part of health studies in Seattle schools.   The type of service varies from city to city. Some ambulancesare run by fire departments, others as separate municipal services.Some cities hire private companies, others rely on hospitals.Volunteers handle emergencies in 30 percent of the casesnationwide, but only one of the 150 largest cities has a volunteerservice.   As recently as the 1960s, most ambulances were operated byfuneral homes because hearses were the only rigs big enough tocarry patients on cots. Care was crude, and rides wererough-and-tumble.   ``Those were the days of `You call. We haul. That's all,''' saidJohn Chew, EMS program director for the U.S. Department ofTransportation.   The federal government stepped in 22 years ago, telling statesto upgrade emergency services to provide some form of rudimentarymedical care. The Highway Safety Act of 1966 was used to pressurereluctant states with the threat of forfeited highway money.   In 1973, the Emergency Medical Act went further, providing $30million over seven years to establish a nationwide EMS network. Butin 1981, oversight shifted and money got tighter under the Reaganpolicy of putting most federal funds into block grants.   That left the states to decide how to divvy up all PreventiveHealth and Health Services money among such programs as ambulances,rat control and fluoridation.   EMS allocations dropped 34 percent from 1981 to 1983, accordingto the General Accounting Office, which was asked to review thesystem by Democratic Sens. Alan Cranston of California and EdwardKennedy of Massachusetts.   State spending has made up some of the difference since but hasnot hit previous levels, the GAO said.   Cranston has sponsored a bill to provide $75 million for EMS andtrauma centers over three years. A similar bill is pending in theHouse.   Ambulance care has evolved on two levels. Basic life supportoffers cardio-pulmonary resuscitation, bandages and oxygen providedby emergency medical technicians. Advanced life support featureshighly skilled paramedics who can inject medicine, restart heartswith electric jolts and clear airways with tubes.   The country has 400,000 EMTs and 35,171 paramedics. Federalguidelines suggest 110 hours of training for EMTs, as many as 1,000hours for paramedics. Only 30 states require certification througha written and practical test for paramedics given by the NationalRegistry of Emergency Medical Technicians.   In some states, paramedics get less schooling than hairstylists.In Ohio, for example, hairstylists train 1,800 hours for a license;a paramedic needs only 1,000 hours.   ``There are very few jobs where somebody's life is in hands thattake less training,'' said William Burns of the national registry.   To get better performance, some cities have turned to privatecompanies. Pinellas County, Fla., which includes Tampa and St.Petersburg, pays Hospital Corporation of America $727,000 a monthfor ambulance service.   ``There's no incentive to be efficient in the public sector,''said Robert Forbuss, president of the American AmbulanceAssociation and head of a private ambulance company in Las Vegas,Nev. ``They're at the mercy of unions and Civil Service. You can'tfire the fire department if it does a bad job.''   About 65 percent of EMS providers are volunteers, but paidprofessionals cover the largest cities and care for 70 percent ofthe population, according to the federal government.   Increasingly, towns are abandoning volunteer systems, due todemand for more sophisticated care and to fewer people who canbalance the demands of regular jobs with the time needed foremergency work.   ``The volunteer system is crumbling. There's no place forvolunteers in a professional service,'' said Patrick Kennedy,president of a private ambulance company that serves Reading, Pa.   ``We're not making cookies or putting out fires out here. Youcan rebuild a building. You can't rebuild a life.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, April 17</NOTE></DOC>
