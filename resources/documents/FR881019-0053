Program Description</ITAG>Head Start, as authorized under the Head Start Act (the Act), is a nationalprogram providing comprehensive child development services. These servicesare provided primarily to low-income children, age three to five, and theirfamilies. To help enrolled children achieve their full potential, HeadStart programs provide comprehensive health, nutritional, educational,social and other services. In addition, Head Start programs are requiredto provide for the direct participation of parents of enrolled children.Parents receive training and education that fosters their understandingof an involvement in the development of their children. They also becomeinvolved in the development, conduct, and direction of local programs.In fiscal year 1987, Head Start was funded to serve 446,523 children througha network of approximately 1,290 grantees and 620 delegate agencies. Duringthe year, 514,981 children received some services. This includes thosewho dropped out. Delegate agencies have approved written agreements withgrantees to operate Head Start programs.While Head Start is intended to serve primarily low-income children andtheir families, Head Start's regulations permit up to 10 percent of thechildren in local programs to be from families that are not low-income.The Act requries that a minimum of 10 percent of enrollment opportunitiesin each State be made available to handicapped children. Such childrenare expected to participate in the full range of Head Start activitieswith their non-handicapped peers, and to receive needed special educationand related services.Each grantee is required to report annually on the services provided tochildren with handicaps as part of the Head Start Program Information Report(PIR). An annual report is provided also to Congress as required by section640(d) of the Head Start Act. In FY 1987, Head Start served 65,275 childrenwho were certified by professionals as handicapped. This constituted 12.7percent of the total enrollment.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Head Start Services to Handicapped Children</ITAG>Beginning in 1972, Head Start mounted a major initiative to provide servicesto handicapped children. It is now the largest provider of services forpreschool children with handicapping conditions in a mainstream settingin the nation. Since that time, the number of children receiving serviceshas nearly tripled. In 1973, when data were first reported, 22,807 childrenwere served; in contrast, 65,275 were served in 1987.During those early years, advances were made in providing services to preschoolchildren with handicaps and helping Head Start programs improve their abilityto meet individual special needs of handicapped children. Recent researchand demonstration activities have provided new information on effectivepractices in working not only with handicapped children, but also withtheir parents. Improvements have occurred in the ability to assess howa child is functioning in the motor, communication, social and cognitiveareas; in the development of technology to help young children with handicapsmeet their potential; and in curriculum development and program evaluation.Also, new evidence of the importance of early assistance and of the roleof parents in programs for children with handicaps has become available.We have attempted to incorporate these new developments into this proposedrule.Head Start services to handicapped children are delivered in the contextof and influenced by requirements in section 504 of the RehabilitationAct of 1973 and the Education of the Handicapped Act, Pub. L. 94-142 andits amendments.As a result of this legislation and other advocacy efforts, during thelast decade many States have passed laws requiring that services be providedto younger children with handicaps. Special education and related services,such as physical therapy, have become more widely available for preschoolage children. Given the increased availability of services, more Head Startprograms provide services by a combination of Head Start staff and personnelfrom other agencies. Coordination with specialized community agencies hasbecome necessary to make the best use of limited resources. Currently,54% of enrolled handicapped children receive services from both Head Startand other agencies.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Provisions of the NPRM</ITAG>Currently, all Head Start programs must meet the requirements of the ProgramPerformance Standards as specified in the regulations at 45 CFR 1304.2-2,1304.3-3(b)(10), 1304.3-4(a)(1) and 1304.3-8(a)(5). These regulations clearlydefine the services for non-handicapped children. Based on the definitionof handicapped children, some standards for services to children with handicapsand services to meet the special needs of their parents were distributedto grantees between 1973 and 1983 through various transmittal memorandaand other policy issuances. However, no standards have ever been set forthin regulation. The new part 1308 will propose specific standards, includingdiagnostic criteria, and offer general guidance for the provision of servicesto children with handicaps and services to meet the special needs of theirparents. Specifically, these regulations will require Head Start programsto:_Design comprehensive services which meet program standards for locatingand serving handicapped children and their parents;_Develop an individualized education program (IEP) to provide appropriatespecial services for each child who is certified as having a handicap;_Screen children within 45 days of admission to the Head Start program,rather than within 90 days as currently recommended, in order that servicesmay be provided in a timely manner;_Use revised diagnostic criteria to determine eligibility for and to assistin obtaining special education and related services;_Designate a coordinator of services for handicapped children, with specificresponsibilities; and_Operate in accordance with standard guidance on the use of PA 26 fundsfor special services for children who have handicaps.These proposed regulations also include some technical amendments to certainsections of 45 CFR Parts 1304 and 1305 which are mandated by legislativeamendments. In addition, we are proposing changes in Parts 1304 and 1305to: (1) Assure that services are provided promptly to handicapped children;and (2) make technical and conforming changes to comport with Part 1308and with changes in the definition of handicapped children in the Educationof the Handicapped Act.When this NPRM is published as a final rule the following transmittalsand policy issuances will be rescinded:1. Head Start Services to Handicapped Children: Transmittal Notice 73.4issued as OCD Notice N-30-333-1-00 by the Office of Child Development (thepredecessor agency to ACYF), 1973.2. Announcement of Criteria for Reporting Handicapped Children in HeadStart: Transmittal Notice 75.11, 1975.3. The Application of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to Head Start, TransmittalNotice 80.4, 1977.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Development of the NPRM</ITAG>During 1984 and 1985, extensive consultation was held with the field concerningthe adequacy and usefulness of the current diagnostic criteria describedin Transmittal Notice 75.11, issued September 11, 1975, and on the comprehensivenessof the guidance in Transmittal Notice 73.4, issued February 28, 1973, onservices to children with handicaps. Head Start directors, coordinators,professional organizations, and technical assistance providers of HeadStart services for handicapped children provided suggestions, comments,and recommendations. The comments indicated that:_Correlating and combining the various pieces of information currentlyavailable is difficult for Head Start grantees;_Existing diagnostic criteria are not useful for some diagnosticians orstaff and are not acceptable to some parents;_The Performance Standards now in effect which pertain to all childrendo not provide sufficient information on meeting the special needs of childrenwith disabilities and their families;_Existing information to grantees does not take into account the many advancesin the state of the art in the last decade or the changes in Federal andState legislation during this same period which affect Head Start or providesufficient assistance in the difficult area of coordination; and_Existing information does not incorporate the results of Head Start experiencein serving low income children with handicaps over the past decade or provideprocedures for appropriate use of PA 26 funds for special services forchildren with handicaps.These findings led us to believe that an NPRM should be developed giventhe recent advances in professional knowledge and research and demonstrationfindings and the wealth of knowledge, experience and expertise evidencedin the recommendations made. Our aim was to incorporate appropriate andstill useful material from past policy issuances into regulation, updatethe diagnostic criteria, and spell out minimum standards all grantees mustfollow in providing services to handicapped children.We had three options in developing new diagnostic criteria: (a) Continuingto use the current criteria; (b) using a general non-categorical criterionsuch as ``in need of special education and related services;'' and (c)proposing revised criteria.We did not select the first option, for several reasons. Foremost amongthem were the concerns of professional and local Head Start personnel whohad problems with the current criteria. For example, some diagnosticiansstated that they would not use the term ``learning disabled'' with childrenyounger than five and some parents found the term ``seriously emotionallydisturbed'' unacceptable.In addition, we reviewed the experience of State Education Agencies andsome local public schools and found that a number of them have developedalternative criteria for preschool program planning purposes.A second option was to use only a broad general category such as ``in needof special education.'' This would have assured that no child would becategorized as having a handicap, but it would not have provided sufficientinformation to assure that appropriate services were provided for eachindividual child. Such a broad criterion would have made it very difficultfor programs to assure that children with handicaps, rather than childrenwho may lag in development as a result of lack of opportunity or experience,would receive specialized services designed to lessen or overcome the resultsof handicapping conditions. Therefore, this option was not selected.The third option of proposing revised diagnostic criteria was selected.We believe that the proposed criteria respond to the concerns expressedby grantee and delegate agencies and reflect experience and changes inthe field over the past decade. We also believe they are easier to use,more specific, and timely. We are augmenting the proposed criteria withguidance to increase emphasis on the prevention of later learning problemsthrough added attention to high-risk children.This proposed rule provides specific standards and guidance on servicesfor children with handicaps and their families. We welcome and solicitcomments on this NPRM.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. How the NPRM Is Structured</ITAG>The proposed performance standards are found in a new Part 1308. Underthis proposed regulation, no child who would be eligible for services underthe current diagnostic criteria will be denied special services. Nor shouldany child be classified as handicapped who would not be categorized ashandicapped under the current diagnostic criteria.At the end of the new Part, we have added an Appendix which contains programmaticguidance for certain sections of the rule. This guidance provides explanatorymaterial and includes recommendations or suggestions for meeting the requirements.However, the guidance is not binding on Head Start grantees or delegateagencies. In instances where a permissible course of action is provided,the grantee or delegate agency may rely upon this guidance or may takeanother course of action that meets the applicable requirements. We haveincluded this programmatic guidance as an aid to grantees because of thecomplexity of providing special services to meet the needs of childrenwith various handicaps.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Section by Section Discussion of the NPPM</ITAG>We propose to issue standards for services to children with handicaps asPart 1308. The new Part 1308 contains eighteen sections, with guidelinesincluded after all but five of the sections. Sections 1308.1 and 1308.2 Purpose and scope. These first two sections explain that Head Start grantees and delegateagencies must meet the requirements of Part 1308. Section 1308.3 Definitions. This section proposes definitions for certain key words that are used throughoutPart 1308. They include such terms as ``handicapped children,'' ``diagnosticcriteria,'' ``special education'' and Mainstreaming.'' Section 1308.4 Handicap services plan. This section is proposed in order to assure that each Head Start programhas a plan for providing services to children with handicaps in an organizedmanner. Section 1308.5 Developing individual education programs. This section proposes to require Head Start programs to develop an IEPfor each handicapped child that will provide for the child's special needs.It specifies that IEP should include, among other things, statements ofthe child's present level of functioning, annual goals, activities to meetthe goals and dates for initiation of the activities. It also requiresthat a team, consisting of the Head Start coordinator of services for handicappedchildren, the child's teacher or home visitor, and others develop the IEP,with parental involvement. Section 1308.6 Evaluation of children. Experience indicates that the existing guidelines which recommend medicaland dental screening within 90 days after enrollment sometimes result inlong delays (several months) before services are provided. This sectionproposes timely screening of children (45 days from the date of enrollment)and further evaluation of a child who has been identified as possibly handicapped.Timely screening is important in order that special services may be providedas soon as possible. We believe 45 days is reasonable time to carry outthe screening activities contained in this rule. However, we welcome commentson how this provision will affect the operation of your program. This sectionalso provides that a team of professionals representing appropriate disciplinesevaluate a child who is referred as possibly handicapped to ensure thatevery effort is made to obtain an accurate diagnosis. Sections 1308.7-1308.14 Diagnostic Criteria. Sections 1308.7 through 1308.14 contain, respectively, diagnostic criteriain the following areas: health impairment, behavior disorders, communicationimpairment, mental retardation, hearing impairment, orthopedic impairment,blindness and visual impairment, and other impairments meeting State eligibilitycriteria for services to preschool children with handicaps. These criteria are based on the definition of ``handicapped children''and utilize current professional recommendations and findings from HeadStart experience. We believe they are clearer, and will be easier to use.The purpose of diagnostic criteria in specific areas is to provide informationon types and severity levels of handicapping conditions for eligibilityand individual program planning purposes. The diagnostician can make recommendationson the basis of functional assessments in order that parents, teachers,and others can best work with the child to enhance his or her potential.Section 1308.15 Handicap/health services coordination. Because effective services for children with handicaps requires coordinationacross all Head Start components, this section clarifies the ways in whichthe handicap services coordinator is required to work with the health andmental health components in such areas as screening, identification ofpossible mental health problems and provision of special services for handicappedchildren. Section 1308.16 Nutrition services.This section provides that a Head Start program must consider the needsof children with handicaps in its nutrition program, e.g., provide consultationwith a physical therapist to assist severely handicapped children who haveproblems chewing, swallowing and feeding themselves. Section 1308.17 Recruitment and enrollment of handicapped children. In this section, we propose to require that the Head Start outreach andrecruitment effort include recruitment of handicapped children. This sectionalso clarifies responsibilities of the coordinator of services for childrenwith handicaps and the social services coordinator. Section 1308.18 Parent participation and transition of children from HeadStart to public school. This proposed section requires the coordinator of services for childrenwith handicaps who are enrolled in Head Start to offer information andassistance to their parents to foster the children's development and learningand to meet their special needs. The Head Start program in cooperationwith the parent will have to notify the local school or other placementprior to the date of transfer to either of these after Head Start. <ITAG tagnum="84">Technical Revisions to Part 1304 and Part 1305 </ITAG>We propose to make technical revisions to certain sections of Part 1304,Program Performance Standards for Operation of Head Start Programs by Granteesand Delegate Agencies, and Part 1305, Eligibility Requirements and Limitationsfor Enrollment in Head Start. Section 1304.1-2 Definitions. The definition of handicapped children is being amended to conform to thedefinition of handicapped children as defined in section 602 of the Educationof the Handicapped Act, as amended, as required by section 640(d) of theHead Start Act. When the Education of the Handicapped Act was amended bysection 602 of Pub. L. 91-230, the definition of handicapped children wasrevised to change the word ``crippled'' to ``orthopedically impaired,''and to include children with specific learning disabilities. In 1983, whenit was amended by section 2 of Pub. L. 98-199, children with ``languageimpairments'' were added. We are taking this opportunity to make thesechanges. (The proposed andSection; 1308.3 contains the definition of handicappedchildren from the Education of the Handicapped Act.)Section 1304.3-3 Medical and dental history, screening and examination.We propose to require that health screening be completed within 45 daysof a child's enrollment to comport with andSection; 130.6.Section 1305.2 Definitions.The definition of handicapped children in paragraph (b)(3) of this sectionis being amended for the reasons stated above under andSection; 1304.1-2.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Impact Analysis</ITAG>Executive Order 12291Executive Order 12291 requires that a regulatory impact analysis be preparedfor major rules defined in the Order as any rule that has an annual effecton the national economy of $100 million or more, or certain other specifiedeffects. Nothing in either the statute or rule is likely to create substantialcosts. The Secretary concludes that this regulation is not a major rulewithin the meaning of the Executive Order because it does not have an effecton the economy of $100 million or more or otherwise meet the thresholdcriteria.Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980Consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. Chapter6), we try to anticipate and reduce the impact of rules and paperwork requirementson small businesses. For each rule with a ``significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities'' we prepare an analysis describingthe rules' impact on small entities. Small entities are defined in theAct to include small businesses, small non-profit organizations, and smallgovernmental entities.While this regulation would affect small entities, it is not substantial,and in many instances the small entities may already meet some of the requirements.For these reasons, the Secretary certifies that this rule will not havea significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.Paperwork Reduction ActUnder the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, Pub. L. 96-511, all Departmentsare required to submit to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) forreview and approval any reporting or recordkeeping requirement in a proposedand final rule. This proposed rule contains information collection requirementsin andSection;andSection;1308.4, 1308.5, 1308.6, and 1308.15 which will besubmitted to OMB for review and approval in accordance with section 3504(h)of the Act. However, many Head Start programs already prepare the plansand maintain the records required.Organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments concerning theaccuracy of the burden estimate and any suggestions for reducing the burdenshould direct them to the agency official designated for this purpose,whose name appears in this preamble, and to the Office of Information andRegulatory Affairs, OMB, New Executive Office Building, Room 3028, Washington,DC 20503, ATTN: Desk Officer for HDS.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>45 CFR Part 1304Dental health, Education of disadvantaged, Grant program/social programs,Health care, Mental health programs, Nutrition, Parental involvement, Reportingand recordkeeping requirements.45 CFR Part 1305Education of disadvantaged, Education of handicapped, Grant program/socialprograms, Handicapped.45 CFR Part 1308Education of the handicapped, Grant program/social programs, Parental involvement,Health care, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="20">(Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program Number 13.600, ProjectHead Start)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: July 6, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Sydney Olson,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Assistant Secretary for Human Development Services.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Approved: August 26, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Otis R.

Ideallythese services would be provided by staff with special training. The provisionof special services must be under the overall supervision of a professionalwith appropriate experience and training.(c) The Head Start grantee or delegate agency must explore options to meetthe needs of handicapped children enrolled or to be enrolled and includethese options in the handicap services plan. These may include:(1) Joint placement of children with other agencies;(2) Shared provision of services with other agencies;(3) Training for Head Start staff in specific procedures;(4) Need for increased staff; and(5) Use of volunteers.(d) The Head Start grantee or delegate agency must use the plan for servicesfor handicapped children as a working document which guides all aspectsof the agency's effort to serve handicapped children.(e) The handicap services coordinator must work with the program directorin planning and implementing the program account (PA) 26 budget, the budgetfor special services for handicapped children.(f) The budget must reflect the objectives and activities in the handicapservices plan. A Head Start grantee or delegate agency may use PA 26 fundsonly for special costs to serve handicapped children, above the costs toprovide basic service for all the children as follows:(1) <T3>Salaries</T3>. These costs include salaries of additional full or part-timeHead Start staff, including the coordinator of handicap services, specialeducators and others qualified and trained in services to handicapped children,to assure that programs have the core capability to recruit, enroll, diagnoseand provide or arrange for services to handicapped children. That portionof salary costs for other component staff which is spent to provide specialservices specifically included in the agency handicap services plan orin a child's IEP as required by section 1308.5 over and above the servicesprovided to all Head Start children may be paid for from PA 26 funds.(2) <T3>Evaluation of children</T3>. When there is a question after the regularHead Start screening and assessment as to whether a child may be handicapped,the Head Start grantee or delegate agency may use PA 26 funds to pay forfurther evaluation, even if the child is found not to be handicapped.(3) <T3>Services</T3>. When the services are not available as donations, PA26 funds may be used to pay for these services including special education;other special services; and therapy, including counseling and involvementof parents of children with handicaps. Dental care for certain severe conditionsmay also be paid for from PA 26 funds, as can summer services necessaryto prevent regression.(4) <T3>Making services accessible</T3>. These costs include elimination ofarchitectural barriers which affect the participation of handicapped children.PA 26 funds may not be used for extensive remodeling or for modificationsof facilities primarily to upgrade the quality of space in the basic programfor all children, even though this may be of indirect benefit to handicappedchildren in the center.(5) <T3>Transportation</T3>. When the agency handicap services plan or an individualeducation program for a specific child includes special services, transportationfor the children and their parents to the site of special services andto the regular educational site may be paid for from PA 26 funds. Whennecessary, the Head Start grantee or delegate agency must arrange for additionaladults to serve as attendants and supervisors.(6) <T3>Special equipment and materials</T3>. Purchase or lease or specialequipment and materials for use in the program or home is allowable fromPA 26 funds.(7) <T3>Training and technical assistance</T3>. Increasing the abilities ofstaff to meet the special needs of handicapped children is an allowableexpense. However, since resources may be available from other sources,it is not expected that extensive use will be made of PA 26 funds for stafftraining. Appropriate expenditures may include but are not limited to:(i) Travel and per diem expenses for Head Start staff and parents to attendhandicap training and technical assistance events;(ii) The provision of substitutes to free staff to attend handicap trainingand technical assistance events;(iii) Fees for courses specifically related to requirements of the handicapservices plan or a child's individual education plan; and(iv) Fees and expenses for a training/technical assistance consultant ifsuch help is not available from another provider at no cost.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1308.5 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Developing individual education programs.</ITAG>(a) Head Start programs must provide procedures for the ongoing observation,recording and evaluation of each handicapped child's growth and developmentfor the purpose of planning appropriate activities to meet the child'sspecial needs caused by the handicap(s) and assuring that they are carriedout. Therefore, programs must develop an individual education program (IEP)for each handicapped child.(b) The IEP must take into account the child's unique needs, developmentalpotential and family circumstances as well as the handicap(s). (c) The IEP must include: (1) A statement of the child's present level of functioning in the social-emotional,motor, communication and cognitive areas of development, and the identificationof needs in those areas requiring specific programming; (2) A statement of annual goals, including short term objectives for meetingthese goals; (3) A statement of needed services to be provided by each Head Start componentthat are in addition to those services provided for all Head Start children;(4) A statement of the specific special education services to be providedto the child and those related services necessary for the child to participatein a mainstream Head Start program. This includes services provided byHead Start and services provided by other agencies and non-Head Start professionals;(5) The identification of personnel responsible for the planning and supervisingof services and for the delivery of services; (6) The projected dates for initiation of services and the anticipatedduration of services; and (7) A statement of objective criteria and evaluation procedures for determiningat least annually whether the short term objectives are being achievedor need to be revised. (d) The IEP must be developed by a team which includes: (1) The Head Start handicap services coordinator or designee; (2) The child's teacher or home visitor; (3) One or both of the child's parents or guardians; and (4) The professional diagnostician(s) who evaluated the child, or someoneknowledgeable about the evaluation. (e) The team may include, in addition: (1) A local education agency representative; (2) Other individuals if invited by the parents; and (3) Other individuals at the discretion of the Head Start program, includingthose component staff particularly involved due to the nature of the child'shandicapping condition. (f) Programs must make vigorous efforts to involve parents in the IEP process.The Head Start program must notify the parents in writing of the purposeand date of the IEP meeting. The meeting must be scheduled at a time andplace mutually agreeable to the parents and the program. If the parentscannot attend the IEP meeting, despite repeated attempts to set up a mutuallyagreeable meeting, the progra must arrange an opportunity to meet withthe parents to review the content of the meeting and secure their inputand signature. (g) Programs must develop and initiate the implementation of the IEP within30 calendar days of the completion of the diagnosis. If a child entersHead Start with a professional diagnosis completed within two months priorto entry, services must begin the first week of program attendance. <ITAG tagnum="56">Subpart C_Health Services Performance Standards</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1308.6 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Evaluation of children. </ITAG>(a) Screening is the first step in a three-part evaluation process consistingof screening, on-going developmental assessment, and diagnosis. (b) The health coordinator is responsible for the health screening of allHead Start children within 45 calendar days of their enrollment. The handicapservices coordinator must cooperate with the health coordinator and staffimplementing developmental screening and health screening. (c) Staff must inform parents of the types and purposes of this screeningwell in advance of the screening, the results, and subsequent evaluations.They must obtain written permission from the parents for the screening.(d) The handicap services coordinator must cooperate with the educationcoordinator in the systematic evaluation of each Head Start child's functioningin all developmental areas. Developmental assessment is the formal andinformal collection of information on each child's functioning in theseareas: gross and fine motor skills, perceptual discrimination, cognition,self-help, social and receptive skills and expressive language. The handicapservices coordinator must include the developmental information in laterdiagnostic and program planning activities for children with handicaps.(e) The handicap services coordinator must arrange for further evaluationof a child who has been identified as possibly handicapped by screening,assessment or referral. A team of professionals representing more thanone discipline must evaluate the child, except in unusual circumstanceswhich must be discussed with the Regional Office. Diagnostic proceduresmust begin within 15 days of identification or screening. (f) A professional member of the diagnostic team who is not a Head Startemployee must certify the child as handicapped and specify the appropriatediagnostic classification. The certifying professional may not be the personwho will be providing special services to the child unless no one elseis available and the majority of the other professional member of the diagnosticteam concur. (g) Head Start grantees and delegate agencies must have diagnosticiansrecommend which of the Head Start diagnostic categories in andSection;andSection;1308.7 through 1308.14 should be used to classify each child they diagnoseas handicapped.(h) The diagnostic criteria described in andSection;andSection; 1308.7 through1308.13 are to be used only for impairments which limit learning, social,emotional or motor development and require special education or relatedservices.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1308.7</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Diagnostic criteria: Health impairment.</ITAG>(a) A child must be classified as health impaired who has limited strength,vitality or alertness due to a chronic health problem.(b) The health impairment classification may include, but is not limitedto, cancer; some neurological disorders; nutrition disorders (includingobesity at or above the 95th percentile and malnutrition disorders belowthe 5th percentile of the growth curve); blood disorders, including hemophilia,sickle cell anemia, etc.; cystic fibrosis; and congenital heart diseaseor strokes.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">For purposes of the handicap services plan and the Program InformationReport, each child should be recorded in the category which covers thefunctions most affected by the handicap for that child.(c) The health impairment classification may also include severe dentalproblems when the condition of the teeth and supporting structures is suchthat routine eating is restricted or impossible; chronic pain is evident;growth and development are delayed or retarded; speech is impacted; andthe child cannot perform daily activities and needs special schedules andservices. The IEP for a child with a severe dental handicap must specifythe modified education program and other services and project a date forestimated termination of the designation as handicapped.(d) Examples of specific severe dental conditions are:(1) Baby nursing bottle caries (four or more affected teeth); or(2) Generalized rampant caries (four or more teeth require pulp therapyrestoration or extraction); or(3) Two or more fractured teeth; or(4) Extra teeth requiring surgical extraction.(e) Head Start grantees and delegate agencies must not classify a childwhose condition is controlled by medication or who has been seizure freefor one year or more as health impaired unless the child requires specialeducation and related services.

This guidance provides explanatory material and includesrecommendations and suggestions for meeting the requirements. However,this guidance is not binding on Head Start grantees or delegate agencies.In instances where a permissable course of action is provided, the granteeor delegate agency may rely upon this guidance or may take another courseof action that meets the applicable requirement. This programmatic guidanceis included as an aid to grantees because of the complexity of providingspecial services to meet the needs of children with various handicaps.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Section 1308.4_Handicap services plan</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">Guidance for paragraph (a)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In order to organize activities and resources to help children withhandicaps overcome or lessen their disabilities and develop their potential,it is important to involve the education, health, social services, parentinvolvement, mental health and nutrition components. ACYF recommends thatparents, staff and policy group members discuss various strategies forassuring that the handicapped service plan integrates needs and activitieswhich cut across the Head Start component areas before the plan is completed.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Programs should ensure that practices they use to provide specialservices do not result in undue attention to a child with a handicap. Forexample, providing names and schedules of special services for handicappedchildren in the classroom is useful for staff or volunteers coming intothat classroom, but posting them would publicize the handicapping conditionof the individual children.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Staff should work for the handicapped children's greater independenceby encouraging them to try new things and to meet appropriate goals bysmall steps. Programs should help handicapped children develop initiativeby including them in opportunities to explore, to create, and to ask ratherthan to answer questions. The children need opportunities to use a widevariety of materials including science tools, art media and costumes inorder to develop skills, imagination and originality. The program shouldinclude them on field trips, as their experience may have been limited,for example, by an orthopedic handicap.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Just as a program makes available pictures and books showing childrenand adults from representative cultural, ethnic and occupational groupsit should provide pictures and books which show handicapped children andadults, including those in active roles.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Staff should plan to answer questions children and adults may haveabout handicaps. This promotes acceptance of a handicapped child for himor herself and leads to treating the child more normally. Effective curriculaare available at low cost for helping children and adults understand handicapsand for improving attitudes and increasing knowledge about disabilities.Information on these and other materials can be obtained from ResourceAccess Projects (RAPs), which offer training and technical assistance toHead Start programs.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">There are a number of useful guides for including handicapped childrenin regular group activities while providing successful experiences forchildren who differ widely in developmental levels and skills. Some ofthese describe activities around a unit theme with suggestions for activitiessuitable for children with different handicaps and skill levels.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="53">Staff need to help some children with handicaps move into developmentallyappropriate play with other children.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">If a deaf child who uses or needs sign language is enrolled, a parent,volunteer or aide who can sign should be provided to help the child benefitfrom the program. Sign language classes are widely available and many youngnon-handicapped children enjoy learning this kind of code.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In order to build the language and speech capabilities of many handicappedchildren who have communication problems, it has been found helpful toenlist aides, volunteers, cooks, bus drivers and parents, showing them<T3>how </T3>to provide extra repetition and model gradually more advancedlanguage as children improve in their ability to understand and use language.Small group activities for children with similar language development needsshould be provided regularly as well as large group language and listeninggames and individual help. Helping children with intellectual delays oremotional problems or those whose experience have been limited by orthopedicor other handicaps to express their own ideas and to communicate duringplay and throughout the daily activities is motivating and can contributegreatly to their progress.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For non-verbal children, communication boards and devices may be helpful.State Departments of Special Education or Developmental Disabilities, UnitedCerebral Palsy or Easter Seal centers or RAPs should be able to provideinformation on how communication boards could be borrowed, made or purchased.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The plan should include any renovation of space and facilities whichmay be necessary to ensure the safety of the children.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 requires that all Federallyassisted programs, including Head Start, be accessible to persons withhandicapping conditions, including staff, parents and children.

Structural changesto make the program services available are required if alternatives suchas reassignment of classes or moving to different rooms are not possible.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Staff should ensure children with physical handicaps have chairs andother pieces of furniture of the correct size and type for their individualneeds as they grow. Agencies such as United Cerebral Palsy can provideconsultation on adapting or purchasing the appropriate furniture. The correctpositioning of certain children is essential and requires expert advice.As the children grow, the furniture and equipment should be checked byan expert such as a physical therapist because the wrong fit can be harmful.Efforts should be made to use furniture sized and shaped to place childrenat the same level as their classmates whenever possible.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">Guidance for paragraph (b)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The plan should specify:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">_Overall goals of the handicapped effort.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">_Specific objectives and activities of the handicapped effort.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">_How and when specific activities will be carried out and goals attained.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">_Who will be responsible for the conduct of each element of the plan.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">_How individual activities will be evaluated.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The plan should address:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">_Enrollment information, including members of children and type ofhandicaps, known and estimated.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">_Identification and recruitment of children with handicaps.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">_Screening.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">_Diagnosis.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">_Assessment.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">_The process for developing individual education programs.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">_The provision of program services and related services.

Programs should use other community agenciesand resources to supplement services for handicapped children and theirfamilies. Grantees should collaborate with other public and private organizationsserving children with handicaps in order to obtain needed resources andshould consider sharing qualified supervisors and specialists.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Head Start funds are limited, and grantees are encouraged to seekfunds from other sources and to use the program's existing resources carefully.By planning ahead grantees can pool resources to schedule periodic useof a diagnostic or consultant team and time share, reducing travel chargesand assuring the availability of scarce expertise. Some public schoolsand other agencies have enabling legislation and funds to purchase education,health, and developmental services of the type Head Start can provide.Grantees can also help increase the amount of preschool funding availableto their State under the Education of the Handicapped Act. The amount ofthe allocation to each State Education Agency and to the public schoolsis determined by the number of three through five year olds with an IndividualEducation Program in place by December 1 of each year. By reporting thenumber of such handicapped children Head Start can generate funds. RAPscan provide information on mandates to serve handicapped children in eachState. They have information on agreements which have been developed betweenHead Start and State Education Agencies and between Head Start and localschools. Such agreements offer possibilities to share training, equipmentand other resources, as well as to smooth the transition from Head Startto public or private school for children and their parents. They can bemutually beneficial and save resources. Some of these agreements specifycost sharing practices. The Education of the Handicapped Act Amendmentsof 1986 provide new impetus to full services for handicapped children by1990 and underline the importance of joint planning and cooperation withlocal public schools and other agencies. When PA 26 funds are not adequateto cover special services for children with handicaps, Program Account22 funds can be used for services for children with handicaps, such aschildren with severe dental problems affecting learning and development.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">Guidance for paragraph (f)(4)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">It may be helpful to explore the possibility of a cooperative agreementwith the public school to provide transportation. However, when it is impossibleto obtain donated services and lack of transportation prevents a handicappedchild from participating in Head Start, PA 26 funds should be used to covertransportation costs before a delay occurs which will have a negative effecton the child's progress. The major emphasis is on providing the neededspecial help so the child can develop to the maximum during the brief timein Head Start.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">Guidance for paragraph (f)(6)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Care should be taken not to purchase expensive items such as wheelchairsor audiometers if they can be provided through other resources, such asCrippled Children's Services. Cooperative arrangements can be made withpublic schools and other agencies to share equipment such as tympanometers.Generally, special equipment and materials, other than those in commonuse in programs for pre-school handicapped children, should be purchasedonly when required by an individual child's education plan.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">Guidance for paragraph (f)(7)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Staff should have access to regular ongoing training events whichkeep them abreast of new materials, equipment and practices related toserving children with handicapping conditions and to preventing handicaps.On-going training and technical assistance in support of the handicappedeffort should be planned to complement other training available to meetstaff needs. Each Head Start program has the responsibility to identifyor arrange the necessary support to carry out training for parents andstaff.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">It builds the core capability of the program to have speech, languageand other therapy provided in the regular site whenever possible. Thisallows for the specialist to demonstrate to regular staff and plan fortheir follow through. It also reduces costs of transporting children toclinics and other settings. When university graduate students are usedto provide special services, it is helpful to arrange for their supervisorsto monitor their work. Programs arranging for such assistance are providinga valuable internship site and it is to the university's advantage to havetheir students become familiar with programs on site. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Best use of training funds has resulted when programs carry out astaff training needs assessment and relate current year training plansto previous staff training with the goal of building core capability. Staffwho receive special training should share new knowledge with the rest ofthe staff. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Many agencies offer free training for staff and parents. An exampleis the Epilepsy Foundation of America with trained volunteers throughoutthe country. Head Start and the American Optometric Association have signeda memorandum of understanding by which member optometrists offer eye healtheducation and screening. State-funded adult education and training programsor community college child development and parenting classes can be usedat low or no cost. Programs should consider the need for training in workingwith parents, in developing working collaborative relationships and innetworking when planning training. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The handicap services coordinator needs to work closely with the educationand health coordinators to provide or arrange training for staff and parentsearly in each program year on prevention of handicaps. This should includethe importance of observing signs that some children may have mild or fluctuatinghearing losses due to middle ear infections. Such losses are often undetectedand can cause problems in learning speech and language. Many children withhearing losses benefit from amplification and auditory training in howto use their remaining hearing most efficiently. The handicap coordinationshould also work with the education coordinator to provide timely stafftraining on recognizing signs that some children may be at high risk forlater learning problems, as well as emotional problems resulting from failureand frustration. This training should address ways to help children developthe skills necessary for later academic learning, such as following directionscalling for more than one action, sequencing, sustaining attention, andmaking auditory and visual discriminations. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Head Start legislation calls for training and technical assistanceto be offered to all Head Start programs with respect to services for handicappedchildren without cost through Resource Access Projects (RAPs) which serveeach area of the country. The RAP contracts require that they contact eachprogram to determine needs. Although their staff are small and their budgetslimited, they are experienced and committed to meeting as many needs asthey can. They welcome your inquiries. A brochure with names and addresssof the RAPs is available from ACYF/HS, P.O. Box 1182, Washington, DC 20013. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Section 1308.5.

In orderto facilitate communication with other agencies who may cooperate in providingservices and especially with public or private schools which the childrenwill eventually enter, it is recommended that programs become familiarwith the format of the IEP used by the local schools. The format of theIEP to be developed for children in Head Start can vary according to localoption. It should be written to serve as the working document for use byteachers and others providing services for a child. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In those instances in which a child is receiving services from anotheragency and already has an IEP, or when a child will be placed jointly inHead Start and another agency, an IEP should be developed collaborativelyand adapted so that it will be appropriate to the child's participationin Head Start. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">It is recommended that the staff review the IEP of each diagnosedhandicapped child more frequently than the minimum once a year to keepthe objectives and activities current. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Programs should provide services in the least restrictive environment,the setting as near to the regular setting with non-handicapped childrenas is appropriate for each child, based on the IEP.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">It is ideal if a child can be mainstreamed in the full program withmodifications of some of the small group, large group or individual programactivities to meet his special needs. However, this is not possible orrealistic in some cases on a full-time basis. The IEP team needs to considerthe assessment and diagnostic information, parental information and desires,and types of settings available to plan for the best situation for eachchild.

Universities, civicorganizations or organizations to aid recent immigrants may be able tolocate native speakers to assist.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">It is strongly recommended that screening with impedance audiometryto determine middle ear function be used to complement pure tone audiometry.Frequent rescreening is needed for children with recurrent ear infections.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Programs should use Child Find, the preschool identification effortcarried out by public schools, and identification efforts of other agenciesto augment Head Start recruitment and screening. This encourages coordinationnot only in identification but also in other areas, such as training andtransition of children. Some programs have found it strengthens the skillsof their staff to have all members learn to do developmental screening.This can be a valuable in-service activity. State requirements for qualificationsshould be checked. Non-professional screeners should be trained. This approachsaves funds for diagnosis and services.

It is good practice to include at least three professionalsfrom different disciplines on a team. Some diagnostic resources alreadyexist as teams with representation from the many professions. The HeadStart program, however, must often take the responsibility for coordinationof the professionals involved. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">Guidance for paragraph (f)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Programs should select diagnosticians familiar with the specific HeadStart population, taking into account the age of the children and theircultural and ethnic background as it relates to the overall diagnosticprocess and the use of specific tests. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Programs should explain that Head Start programs are funded to providepreschool developmental experiences for all eligible children, some ofwhom have additional special needs caused by a handicapping condition.The intent of the diagnostic procedures is to identify children who havehandicapping conditions, so they can receive appropriate assistance. Itis not the intent to provide services for children for whom basic HeadStart programming is designed and who may show developmental delays whichcan be overcome by a comprehensive program meeting the Head Start PerformanceStandards. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">It is important that the Head Start diagnostic criteria be explainedto the diagnosticians and that they be informed as to how the results willbe used. Programs should inform diagnosticians that Head Start requiresa categorical diagnosis and needs information on how the child is functioning.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Programs should request specific intervention recommendations fromthe diagnosticians for use in developing the child's IEP and to ensurethat parents, teachers and others can best work with the child. Some programshave obtained useful functional information by asking diagnosticians tocomplete a brief form describing the child's strengths and weaknesses andthe effects of the handicap, along with suggestions for special equipment,treatment or services. The diagnosticians should be asked to write theirfindings in easily understood terms. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">When a referral has been made to a diagnostician, Head Start shouldprovide comprehensive information to the diagnostician. This informationshould include screening results, pertinent observations, as consentedto in writing by the parents, and the results of any developmental screeningsor assessments which have been completed. Parents and Head Start staffshould be involved in conferences held by diagnostic team members. Professionaldiagnosticians employed as Head Start staff can participate in making professionaldiagnoses. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">It is important that programs ensure that no individual child or familyis labeled, mislabled, or stigmatized with reference to a handicappingcondition. Head Start must exercise care to ensure that no child is identifiedas handicapped because of economic circumstances; ethnic or cultural factors;or developmental lags not caused by a handicap, bilingual or dialecticaldifferences, or being non-English speaking. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The selection of the appropriate diagnostic category should includeconsideration of the way the handicap affects the child's ability to function,as well as the cause of the condition. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For example, one child diagnosed as having fetal alcohol syndromeand manifesting mental retardation as the most disabling condition wouldbe reported in the mental retardation category, whereas another child reportedas having fetal alcohol syndrome may be reported in the behavior disorderscategory if behavior difficulties are the major symptom. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Some children may have a recent diagnosis prior to enrolling in HeadStart. In these cases, Head Start should contact the diagnostician forthe categorical diagnosis and obtain a functional assessment, if one hasnot been done. Some already diagnosed children have severe handicaps anda serious need for services. Some of these children may already be receivingsome special assistance in other agencies but lack developmental serviceswith other children. Head Start programs may best meet their needs by servingthem jointly, saving fund (which would have been used for diagnosis) forthe needed services. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Section 1308.7 Diagnostic criteria: Health impairment </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">Guidance </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Many health impairments manifest themselves in other handicappingconditions.

In order to be effective, such plansmust be developed jointly. They are advantageous for the children, parents,Head Start and the public school. RAPs have gathered and developed materialsuseful for transition. Programs in isolated areas need to pay particularattention to transition. For example, American Indian programs whose childrenmove into several systems, such as Bureau of Indian Affairs schools andpublic schools, need to prepare children and families in advance for thenew situation. Plans should be used as working documents and reviewed forannual update, so that the foundation laid in Head Start is maintainedand strengthened.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="56">PART 1304_PROGRAM PERFORMANCE STANDARDS FOR OPERATION OF HEAD STARTPROGRAMS BY GRANTEES AND DELEGATE AGENCIES</ITAG>2.
