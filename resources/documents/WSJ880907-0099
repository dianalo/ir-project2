Under secret government orders, they designed Britain's first nuclear bomb. Later, they produced one of the world's first nuclear power plants. And in 1957 they came of age by battling the first serious nuclear accident, a deadly fire at the Windscale reactor.    Now, their successors are shooting for another nuclear-industry milestone: to be first to diversify beyond nuclear power.    Strapped by government budget cuts, the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority, or UKAEA, is going commercial. It has a new trade name, AEA Technology, and is repackaging its scientists as experts in petroleum technology, microelectronics and computer software. The atom remains its main business. But the authority is rifling dusty files for inventions it can sell to other industries. It is boosting its sales force, hiring marketing consultants and hustling to win research contracts from Ford Motor Co., Royal Dutch/Shell Group and other multinationals.    Says C. Fraser Old, a sales-hungry UKAEA scientist fearful of budget cuts: &quot;Nothing concentrates the mind like the prospect of being hanged in the morning.&quot;    The fact that the authority is diversifying highlights the travails of nuclear power, which was in a tailspin even before the nuclear disaster at the Soviet Union's Chernobyl power station. In Britain as in many industrial countries, spending on nuclear energy is falling. Government atomic labs are shrinking or hunting new business. &quot;We're 40 years on from the start of the nuclear dream&quot; and the big-spending euphoria of the 1950s and 1960s is over, says UKAEA Chairman John Collier.    In many countries, atom-plant construction is slowing, a victim of cheap oil, high costs and anti-nuclear protests; the U.S. electricity industry hasn't ordered a reactor since 1978. And according to the International Energy Agency, a Paris-based club of industrial nations, government nuclear-research spending in 20 developed countries fell 35% to $4.22 billion last year from its 1982 high.    Many decry the research cuts as shortsighted. Continued burning of fossil fuel, it is feared, may hasten a global atmospheric warming -- the so-called greenhouse effect. Yet by slashing atomic-power research, &quot;we are abandoning the one thing which might provide us with a solution,&quot; complains William Brett, a union official at the U.K. agency.    Governments aren't disbanding the labs; instead, they are pushing scientists to find new, private sponsors to tide them through. The U.S. Energy Department's Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee runs 13 &quot;user research facilities&quot; to study new materials, environmental problems and other subjects for a wide range of clients. Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd. forms private partnerships with its most enterprising scientists and sells technical advice to U.S. space-shuttle contractors.    The UKAEA's main laboratory, an hour outside London, also has customers. One lab unit, the Harwell Combustion Center, uses laser techniques borrowed from reactor research to probe car engines. Clients, including a government-subsidized consortium involving Ford Motor Co.'s U.K. unit and Britain's Jaguar PLC, pay about $1.5 million a year for studies on engine &quot;knock&quot; and other topics.    But the Harwell scientists sometimes act like the ivory-tower government researchers they are, rather than the technology entrepreneurs they want to be. &quot;They've got great scientists, but they must come down to our level&quot; of business needs, says Jean-Pierre Pirault, Jaguar's chief engine developer. While rapidly improving, he says, in the past they designed experiments out of touch with what the auto makers needed, and then overwhelmed them with data.    Still, he calls Harwell's ambition of becoming a regular auto-industry consultant realistic; it is one of just a few labs in the world performing such engine research, he says.    Indeed, the UKAEA's technology and reputation are main assets in its hunt for customers. In the 1950s and early 1960s, Britain ran the most successful nuclear-energy program in the world. While the big-spending U.S. and Soviet Union leisurely dabbled in many reactor designs, physicists here focused on mass-producing one model, called Magnox. Most Magnox plants, though costly by today's standards, still are working -- some beyond their planned lives. Britain gets 17.5% of its electricity from nuclear plants, about the same as the U.S.    But little has gone right since the late 1960s. Britain's second-generation design, the Advanced Gas-Cooled Reactor, was a fiasco; only the Soviet Union's Chernobyl-style family of reactors has a worse performance record, according to International Atomic Energy Agency statistics. Last year, Britain finally abandoned it and ordered a U.S. model.    Now, the authority's political clout has decayed. Since the late 1960s, its reactor-building team was spun off to private companies, its atomic weapons research was gobbled up by the Ministry of Defense, and its radiochemical lab was sold to the private sector. Continuing that trend, this summer funding was slashed for its biggest program, developing the &quot;fast-breeder&quot; reactor as a new power source.    &quot;The government have given us a fair old pasting,&quot; fumes Mr. Collier, the authority chairman. But further cuts are expected in 1990, when Britain's soon-to-be privatized electric utilities reduce their research subsidies. And the authority itself may be sold in the 1990s.    All that makes new patrons vital. In the next five years, the authority aims to triple its non-nuclear business to 30% of revenues. In the fiscal year ended March 31, such work provided 9.4% of its $724 million budget. It had contracts to study energy-beam weapons for the U.S. Strategic Defense Initiative, to plan Hong Kong's garbage disposal and to help British Gas PLC clean its pipelines.    To snare corporate clients it is hiring new sales people -- initially 20 of &quot;the sort of man a customer would buy a secondhand car from,&quot; says a Harwell official.    But obstacles abound. The authority's big bureaucracy, fancy lab gear and legions of nuclear-security guards push its costs above $169,000 a scientist. That is far above the costs at many competitors and prices it out of many private contract competitions. Worse, some costs will rise: Its current pay -- about $40,500 for a top scientist -- must climb if it hopes to recruit qualified scientists for consulting work.    Authority officials acknowledge that the transformation will take time. &quot;The system tended to be a runaway spending machine,&quot; says the UKAEA's new business strategist, Charles Chapman. While learning fast, &quot;the authority isn't used to thinking in profit terms.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
