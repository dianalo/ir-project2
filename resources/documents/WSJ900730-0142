Even if members of the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries strictly adhere to their new, self-imposed dailyproduction limit of 22.5 million barrels, bloated inventoriescurrently hanging over the oil market won't disappearquickly. That's because robust consumption that had beensopping up OPEC's excesses is lagging.</LP><TEXT>   Petroleum demand world-wide has edged up barely 1% so farthis year; even the thriving economies in Asia that werethirsty for oil last year have cooled somewhat. And oil usagein the U.S., one of the world's largest energy consumers, hasdeclined from 1989 levels by at least 2% so far this year,according to U.S. Energy Department estimates.   Global inventories, which by some projections stand atabout 1.5 billion barrels of crude, excluding Eastern bloccountries, peaked in May and have declined slightly since.Winter oil demand also will help to whittle stocks downfurther later this year.   &quot;But the situation is still fairly grim,&quot; said JohnRedpath, analyst for Energy Security Analysis Inc., a firmthat tracks oil stocks world-wide. &quot;Working off thoseinventories will be a slow process.&quot;   During the first half of this year, OPEC swamped themarket with crude. By estimates of its own economists, itsproducers poured a surplus of 2.7 million barrels of oil intoinventories each day in the second quarter alone. Now OPECmust wait for the damage it inflicted on the supply anddemand balance to be undone.   Even Hisham Nazer, Saudi Arabia's oil minister,acknowledged that it could take the rest of the year torestore order. The agreement in Geneva setting a new targetprice of $21 a barrel for OPEC crude isn't an instantpanacea, he suggested, but more a springboard for next year'sprices. &quot;The price was deteriorating to such an extent thatit wasn't only hurting us in the short term, but it washurting us in the long term, for 1991,&quot; he told Dow JonesInternational Petroleum Report. &quot;Everything you see here {inthis agreement} is something for the future.&quot;   Burgeoning inventories coupled with the realization thatOPEC overproduction wasn't going to be reined in caused someoil prices earlier this year to tumble by more than $8 abarrel. The price for some lower grade Persian Gulf crudesthat are part of OPEC's average even approached singledigits.   In recent weeks, prices rallied as Iraq openly threatenedmilitary action against Kuwait and the United Arab Emiratesif the two chronic OPEC quota violators didn't cut back. Butthen buying fervor cooled and by the time the Geneva meetingended, the reaction to rhetoric had about fizzled.   &quot;It was the first time anyone threatened overproducerswith a gun,&quot; said William Hermann, chief economist forChevron Corp. explaining why prices initially jumped. &quot;Butthen reality set in. There's a big overhang of stocks;there's a lot of oil out there.&quot;   Though some grades of U.S. crude currently exceed $20 abarrel, most major grades of OPEC crude are still below $17.   Experts are confident that supply and demand will becomebalanced and OPEC's new $21 target will be reached at somepoint, however. They note that for the first time in memorymembers actually appear ready to adhere to their quotas.&quot;Iraq as the enforcer has become the key,&quot; said CharlesMaxwell, senior energy strategist for C.J. Lawrence. &quot;Pricesaren't any longer an economic calculation so much as apolitical-military calculation.&quot;   Iraq needs cash to rebuild its economy, shattered by itsnow-ended war against Iran. To refill its coffers, it needshigher oil prices. So, &quot;tolerance of {overproduction by}Kuwait and UAE is at an end,&quot; said Ted Eck, chief economistfor Amoco Corp.   While it isn't certain that Iraq's mercurial leader SaddamHussein would actually turn his battle-hardened army loose onformer ally Kuwait, he is generating considerable fear amongPersian Gulf powers. Some experts think he intends to sowpolitical unrest to weaken neighboring governments so as toestablish himself as the undisputed Arab leader of the MiddleEast. &quot;Before they used to worry about Khomeini {of Iran}exporting his revolution,&quot; said Lawrence Goldstein, whofollows Mideast oil politics closely for the PetroleumIndustry Research Foundation. &quot;Now they've got Hussein.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
