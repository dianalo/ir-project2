Attorney Stephen Sachs said the incarceration, the latest eventin a bitter custody battle, has become irrational andunconstitutional because ``Dr. Morgan will never relent.''   The plastic surgeon has been at D.C. Jail since last Aug. 28,when she refused a D.C. Superior Court judge's order to allow her5-year-old daughter to visit her ex-husband, who she charged hadabused the child.   She has refused to disclose her daughter's whereabouts sincethen.   Sachs said that since Judge Herbert Dixon ordered the womanjailed to coerce her to reveal the girl's whereabouts, ``Dr.Morgan's incarceration has become punitive.''   ``She will never comply with the order of the Superior Court,''Sachs told U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson. ``It is notlikely any woman, any parent, could relent when she has seen whathas happened to her daughter.''   The woman has charged through a long-running battle over thegirl's custody that Eric Foretich, also a prominent doctor in theWashington area, abused the child. Foretich has denied the charges.   Johnson said the issue of whether the length of incarcerationwas unconstitutional had not been dealt with by the lower court orby the local appeals court and so a federal court may not be theproper forum for the case.   The judge said she expected to rule next week on whether torelease the woman.</TEXT></DOC>
