For job applicants, the chance of being tested was four timeshigher than for workers already on the job, the Labor Departmentsurvey of 7,500 employers showed.   The survey, conducted last summer, found that only 3 percent ofall employers had drug-testing programs. Together, those companiesemployed 20 percent of American workers.   Just 7 percent of employers offered some type of drug counselingor other employee-assistance program. In all, 31 percent of workerswere covered by these efforts.   The survey found no rush to begin testing programs atestablishments that don't have them now. Only 4 percent of employerssaid they were considering launching a testing program in the nextyear; just 3 percent said they might create employee-assistanceprograms.   Those numbers were sharply lower than past estimates of theprevalence of drug-testing programs.   A 1986 survey of 492 organizations by the Employment ManagementAssociation said 20.9 percent reported having testing programs. AMichigan State University study that year said 43 percent ofemployers who were not testing for drugs were considering doing so.   Labor Department researchers, asked about the sharply lowernumbers in the their study, said the government's larger sample sizeshould make the new estimates the most accurate yet.   The study did not include government workers, many of whom aresubject to drug testing under state and federal policies that arethe focus of dozens of legal challenges nationwide. The LaborDepartment said no figures were available on the number of publicworkers subject to drug testing.   As to who is tested in the private sector, the 7,500 employerstold the Labor Department researchers that 953,000 workers had beentested in the previous 12 months, compared to 3.9 million jobapplicants.   In all, the report said that ``about 85 percent of establishmentswith testing programs targeted job applicants while 64 percentfocused on current employees. ... Employers with testing programsappear to place a high priority on keeping potential drug problemsout of the workplace.''   Studies have estimated that employers lose more than $8 billion ayear in wasted productivity because of drug use.   Of the estimated 953,000 workers tested for drug use, the surveysaid that 9 percent had tested positive. Of the applicants tested,12 percent were positive.   Researchers cautioned against taking those figures asrepresentative of the rate of drug use, because such a smallproportion of employees test for drugs and because so much testingis performed on suspected drug users.   Indeed, about two-thirds of employers conducting tests did themonly on workers suspected of drug use, while one-fourth had programsthat subjected all employees to possible testing.   Workforce size was by far the biggest factor in determiningwhether an employer had a drug-testing program.   Of the nation's largest establishments, those with 1,000employees or more, 43 percent tested for drugs while 76 percentoffered counseling or some other form of assistance. But only about2 percent of the smallest establishments, those with fewer than 50workers, had testing programs; 9 percent had employee-assistanceprograms.   A breakdown by industry found the highest rate of positive testresults, about 20 percent, among employees in wholesale and retailtrade.   That industry also had the highest rate of positive test resultsamong applicants, 17 percent for wholesale trade and 24 percent forthe retail sector.   The lowest rate of positive test results among employees was intransportation, 5.6 percent, a statistic influenced by mandatorytesting in many sectors of the industry. Nearly 10 percent ofapplicants for transportation jobs tested positive for drugs, thestudy found.   The rate of positive test results among applicants was lowest, at5.5 percent, in communications and public utilities. Nearly 8percent of workers in those industries who were checked testedpositive for drugs.   Mining, communications and public utilities, and transportationemployers were most likely to have drug-testing programs, partlybecause of regulatory requirements, the study said. Least likely tohave testing programs were retail trade, service and constructionestablishments.</TEXT></DOC>
