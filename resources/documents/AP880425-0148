(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A former top aide has left JimmySwaggart's church to start his own, but says he still lovesSwaggart and is not trying to compete with the defrockedevangelist's ministry.   ``We left friends. Brother Swaggart and I are still friends,''said the Rev. Jerald Ogg after inaugural services at Bethel TempleAssemblies of God Church on Sunday.   Ogg, who set up Swaggart's foreign crusades and often served asa ministry spokesman, said he still loves Jimmy Swaggart WorldMinistries.   ``I've always wanted to pioneer a church,'' said Ogg. ``I'mgetting that chance here, but it's going to take time.''   The 80 worshipers at the first Bethel Temple service had to singfrom memory because there were no hymn books or church bulletins.Ogg put three small advertisements in local newspapers announcingSunday's services, but said he is not trying to steal worshipers.   ``We will do nothing unethical. We have not called anyone andasked them to come,'' he said.   Meanwhile, services at Swaggart's own Family Worship Center weredisrupted by a man who said God had sent him with a message:Swaggart should return to the pulpit immediately.   Swaggart is observing a three-month ban on preaching imposed byLouisiana Assemblies of God leaders as part of the punishment forhis reported visit to a prostitute. Swaggart left the Assemblies ofGod after the national church extended the ban to a year.   ``Let him preach, man!'' shouted Herbert G. Hobbs of Savannah,Ga.   Ushers escorted Hobbs out. In an interview shortly afterward,Hobbs said God told him to drive from Georgia to tell Swaggart``that (God) wants him up on his feet and preaching now.''   Swaggart laughed and remained seated next to his wife, Frances,during the incident.   At Bethel Temple, Ogg recalled the beginning of Swaggart'schurch eight years ago.   ``Some of you were there to start that church with me, too,'' hetold the fledgling congregation.   ``This will be a wide-open church. We will have an advisorypanel for running the church,'' said Ogg, adding that thecongregation will vote on major decisions.   Ogg will be the pastor of Bethel Temple, with his son Jeff asco-pastor. Jeff Ogg was in charge of the ministry for single menand women at the Family Worship Center.</TEXT></DOC>
