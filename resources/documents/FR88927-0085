No other applications are solicited or will be accepted.<ITAG tagnum="84">Authority </ITAG>This program is authorized under section 22(e)(7) of the Occupational Safetyand Health Act of 1970 and section 301(a) of the Public Health ServiceAct. The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance number is 13.283. <ITAG tagnum="84">Purpose </ITAG>The objectives of this program are: 1. To develop a demonstration program for dissemination of control technologyto small businesses, by using State sponsored business assistance programs;2. To increase the acceptance and awareness of specific health and safetycontrols; 3. To develop a generic model for disseminating control technology to smallbusinesses. <ITAG tagnum="84">Availability of Funds </ITAG>It is expected that the cooperative agreement will be for a 3-year projectperiod beginning on or about September 30, 1988. The estimated cost ofthis project is $35,000 for the first year and approximately $30,000 foreach of the remaining 2 years. The second year and the subsequent yearare subject to the availability of funds and satisfactory progress of theapplicant in meeting the objectives of the cooperative agreement. <ITAG tagnum="84">Single Source Justification </ITAG>The project will develop useful information for small businesses basedupon NIOSH control technology research and will explore the utility ofusing small business assistance programs to disseminate this informationabout occupational safety and health controls. Small business assistanceprograms exist in most State governments but are unused for communicatingoccupational safety and health messages. Through this project a model willbe developed that can be used by NIOSH to encourage the implementationof control technology in other States and industries by developing theappropriate materials and cost effective strategies to reach those at riskfrom the asbestos dust. The State of Ohio has specialized resources that uniquely qualify it todevelop a model dissemination program for brake shoe controls. It has linkedthese resources through the State's Transportation Research Center andthe Ohio Technology Transfer Organization (OTTO). OTTO has agents locatedthroughout the State's urban and rural areas so that the differences ingaining acceptance to controls between urban and rural settings can beaddressed in the model. OTTO is characterized by an active network whoseagents interact continuously with each other and commonly use the resourcesof the State's university system to find solutions to technical problemsfacing small business. Therefore, the Transportation Research Center, directedby the Ohio State University, is the natural connection for technical assistancein developing this model program. The Transportation Research Center has facilities for testing braking systemsthat are unique in the United States. The staff of the Center has unrivaledexpertise in the engineering performance of braking systems. This expertise,combined with the outreach and communications abilities of the OTTO agentsand the technical evaluation of the controls completed by NIOSH staff,creates a unique situation with high probability of success. The TransportationResearch Center as part of the Engineering Experiment Station at the OhioState University will provide the technical support for developing materialsto train those at risk to control exposure to asbestos dust during brakeshoe replacement. These materials will be based upon the information developedby NIOSH about brake shoe controls. Without the unique capabilities ofthe Transportation Research Center, the development of the model couldnot be attempted. The network linkage between OTTO and the Transportation Research Centeralready exists. Ohio State University (OSU), through its OSU/OTTO office,provides the principal technical support for OTTO. The Director of OSU/OTTOis also affiliated with the Engineering Experiment Station. OTTO is a nationallyrecognized leader in technology transfer to small businesses. It is geographicallydiverse with 34 agents located in the various public universities and communitytechnical colleges throughout Ohio. Twenty community colleges and universitiesaffiliated with OTTO have automative technology or automotive engineeringprograms. Because of its agent's physical location at the Ohio technicalcommunity colleges, OTTO representatives have close ties to the community.The ability of the agents to gain access to small businesses and to gainacceptance of the engineering control is necessary for the performing organization.OTTO has a well motivated and experienced staff interested in developingthis communication model. There is no other State that has the combinationof facilities, expertise, and experience in providing new technologiesto small businesses along with the geographic diversity inherent in thecommunity college base agent network. The 10 years of OTTO's existencehas stimulated similar programs in other States. However, these emergingprograms have not yet developed the networks necessary for proficiencyin technology transfer, nor do they have the necessary technical supportto develop a model demonstration program to disseminate control technologyto small businesses. The State of Ohio is attractive because it providesa wide variety of small business settings ranging from the highly industrializedto the rural. OTTO is experienced in dealing with small businesses in allthese settings.<ITAG tagnum="84">Cooperative Activities</ITAG>A. Recipient (OTTO) Activities1.
