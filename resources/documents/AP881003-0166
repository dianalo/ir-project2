No pickup</NOTE><DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Voice of Lebanon radio station saidtoday American hostage Alann Steen could be released soon inSyrian-policed Moslem west Beirut.   ``Steen has not been released yet, but he could appear veryshortly,'' the radio said, adding the hostage was expected toappear either at west Beirut's commercial Hamra district or in BirHassan at the city's southern edge.   At the United Nations in New York, Syrian Foreign MinisterFarouk Al-Sharaa said one of the American hostages could bereleased at ``any minute.''   ``Now I have good news for the American people,'' he told a newsconference. ``In particular, because one of the American hostageswill be released within one hour from now. He can be released anyminute.''   The foreign minister said the hostage would be released inLebanon, brought to the Syrian capital of Damascus and turned overto U.S. officials. He said he did not known the name of the hostage.   In Washington, President Reagan's chief spokesman said theUnited States has been told by another government in the MiddleEast that a hostage will be released.   Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater refused to identify the country thatsent the message and would not confirm that the hostage was anAmerican.   The Voice of Lebanon cited unidentified high-ranking securitysources for its brief report.   The station is based in Christian east Beirut and speaks for theright-wing Christian Phalange party.   A group holding Steen and two other American professors as wellas an Indian colleague said in a statement released Saturday thatit would free one of the hostages as a goodwill gesture to theUnited States.   The group, calling itself Islamic Jihad for the Liberation ofPalestine, said the release was designed to stimulate U.S. supportfor the 10-month-old Palestinian uprising against Israel's militaryoccupation in the West Bank and Gaza strip.   The group's statement did not specify a deadline or say whichhostage would be released, but called on the families of the fourhostages to be on hand in Beirut for the release.   That appeared to be addressed to Steen's wife Virginia-Rose, whois vacationing with her parents in the United States. She isexpected back in Beirut Wednesday. Steen was reported ill at onepoint in his captivity but the reports could not be confirmed.   The four educators were kidnapped by gunmen posing as riotpolice Jan. 24, 1987 at the campus of Beirut University College.   Steen, 49, a native of Boston, was professor of journalism atthe university. His wife, 31, of Jackson, Mich., is a fine artsprofessor at the school.   The other three hostages the group claims to hold are: JesseTurner, 41, a native of Boise, Idaho, and a professor ofmathematics and computer science; Robert Polhill, 54, of New YorkCity, professor of business and lecturer in accounting; andMithileshwar Singh, 61, professor of finance and resident alien ofthe United States.   Their wives are tensely waiting for news at Badr Turner's campusapartment.   ``We are listening to the radios. God willing these rumors cometrue. It's a good sign whoever is released,'' Mrs. Turner, aLebanese, said in a telephone interview.   A spokesman at the U.S. Embassy said he has no comment on thereport.   Nine Americans are missing in Lebanon. The longest held is TerryAnderson, the chief Middle East correspondent of The AssociatedPress. He was abducted March 16, 1985.   In Clark Lake, Mich., Mrs. Steen waited by her telephone todayfor news of her husband.   ``We're just waiting and watching like everybody else ...'' shesaid in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. ``There'snothing confirmed yet.''   Mrs. Steen said she talked to representatives of the StateDepartment earlier today, but she did not say what was discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
