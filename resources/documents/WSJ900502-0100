Theshadows will some day recede. Do not be surprised if theGreek chorus then moans a deeper loss than the personalanguish of Mr. Milken. A legal system that could declareitself satisfied with last week's plea bargain is a systemheaded for a fall.   Proportionality and fairness crumpled to give way to theprosecution of Mr. Milken: The prosecutorial tactics were acannon to the flea of the six eventual pleas by Mr. Milken.His plea has little to do with the original indictment'sallegations. The liquidation of Drexel Burnham Lambert andMr. Milken's $600 million fine completely dwarf the harm doneto clients and investors, which likely comes to less than $1million. Without minimizing his offenses, the JusticeDepartment and Securities and Exchange Commission have someexplaining to do.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Milken has settled for some jail time and a possiblypartly tax-deductible fine. What remains unclear is how greata criminal we should view Mr. Milken or how proud we shouldbe of our legal system for winning this plea bargain.   Let's first understand what Mr. Milken did not admit. Theindictment was 98 charges of racketeering, insider tradingand a manipulation scam underlying the junk-bond and takeovermarkets.   No one seems to have noticed that Mr. Milken did not admitto any of the charges as originally described in theindictment. Instead, prosecutors indicted first, askedquestions later. As Justice Robert Jackson warns nearby, fewthings are as dangerous as a prosecutor who finds a target,then looks for crimes to pin on him.   It was no surprise that Mr. Milken did not admit to anyRICO counts -- these were included solely as rubber hoses tobludgeon a plea. But Mr. Milken also did not admit to anyinsider trading. In other words, those who consider him acommon crook must also think he is an idiot. At the peak ofthe takeover battles, Mr. Milken had huge amounts of insideinformation, probably more inside information than everyoneelse in the market combined. Prosecutors apparently didn'tfind a single case of misusing this information.   Most important, this means Mr. Milken is no Ivan Boesky, areal crook who made easy money by trading suitcases of cashfor stolen inside information. So why did prosecutors agreeto give Mr. Boesky a reduced sentence for fingering Mr.Milken? Maybe they assumed there was more to the Milken casethan exists. After all, former prosecutor Rudolph Giulianialso leaped to wrong conclusions in the abortedinsider-trading indictment of investment bankers RobertFreeman, Richard Wigton and Timothy Tabor.   Of the six crimes to which Mr. Milken pleaded, only threewere in the indictment in even a distorted form. TheFischbach takeover, for example, is better viewed as Mr.Boesky leaning on Mr. Milken for a favor than the other wayaround. The indictment didn't mention the one crime where Mr.Milken harmed clients. This was a commission-shaving schemethat cost clients several hundred thousand dollars -- thoughlegally if only disclosed.   His lawyers noted that most of Mr. Milken's crimes wereaccommodating the more serious offenses of others. Mr. Milkensaid he knew at the time that his acts were wrong, but didn'tsay he knew that they were crimes. Until recent years no onecould have imagined that victimless offenses such as aidingand abetting someone else in filing a false net capital FormX-17A-5 or an incomplete disclosure 13-D Form would warrantmore than a harsh letter from the SEC or a nominal fine.   If prosecutors were so sure of their case, why theextraordinary pressure on Mr. Milken to cop a plea? RICOmakes a farce of the entire case. The Justice Department'sown prosecutorial guidelines prohibit such &quot;imaginativeprosecutions&quot; under the anti-mobster law because of RICO'sbrutal force.   RICO meant Mr. Milken faced a possible jail sentence of520 years and a fine of $11 billion. We lack the finality ofa trial partly because the Princeton/Newport trial put Mr.Milken on notice that vague RICO allegations of fraud areenough for convictions. Prosecutors made his lawyer brotheran indicted co-racketeer even though he had little to do withthe allegedly illegal transactions. Settling freed thebrother as a RICO hostage.   It's also possible that some prosecutors actually equateinvestment banking and racketeering. One lawyer recounts thechilling response he got when he tried to persuade topJustice officials that RICO was inappropriate in a securitiescase. A Justice official asked, &quot;Isn't putting a company inplay criminal and an act of racketeering?&quot; It explains a lotif prosecutors think hostile takeovers are crimes.   I also understand that to get the plea prosecutorsthreatened new indictments in every state where a savings andloan bought bonds from Drexel. Trying to smear Mr. Milkenwith the thrift mess would have been high irony; untilCongress forced fire sales, junk bonds were among thrifts'safer investments. Mr. Milken must have wondered what next?when an FBI agent was dispatched to interrogate his92-year-old grandfather.   After all this, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said thisshows the government won't abide &quot;crime in the suites.&quot; SECChairman Richard Breeden held a press conference to say thatMr. Milken's &quot;admissions today demonstrate that he stood atthe center of a network of manipulation, fraud and deceit.&quot;   What this case in fact shows is that if prosecutors hadthe courage of Mr. Milken's supposed convictions, they shouldhave dropped the abusive RICO counts and gone to court. Nowprosecutors will use their sentencing memorandum to the judgeto retry the case without risk of rebuttal.   Mr. Milken's great accomplishments do not excuse cuttinglegal corners, but justice requires viewing Mr. Milken by allthat he did with his financial genius. His hubris was thatgetting the deals done came to be more important thanremembering that even in the most advanced societiesrenegades get no margin for error. In the end, prosecutorialabuses yield the best perspective on the Milken plea.</TEXT></DOC>
