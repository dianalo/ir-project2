RoschandM;If speed were not an issue, there would be no jetliners, no assembly lines,no high-megahertz computers -- and no AutoCAD 386.andP;  Indeed, extra programspeed is the major reason for buying the latest incarnation of the mostpopular PC-based CAD product from Autodesk Inc.: It runs faster than itsforebear, AutoCAD release 10.andM;This makes sense, considering that AutoCAD 386 is compatible only with 386-and 486-based PCs.andM;AutoCAD 386 is also faster and easier to install than earlier versions,virtually eliminating the intricate fine-tuning that was needed to bolsterrelease 10's performance.andP;  This is perhaps the most important aspect of theupgrade for systems integrators and installers.andP;  Setup and configuration timeis trimmed to little more than 15 minutes, and the need for experimentationto derive optimum performance is eliminated.andM;AutoCAD 386 sports a retail price tag of $3,300, although registered AutoCAD10 owners can upgrade to the 386 version for $300.andM;Up until now the only alternative for speeding AutoCAD performance was to buya higher-performance computer, so the upgrade price is a bargain.andM;Other than its increased vigor and smoother installation, AutoCAD 386 is notmuch different from release 10.andP;  In fact, the two programs have an identicaluser interface.andM;On the level of actual program code, AutoCAD 386 differs only in that it hasbeen recompiled with the benefit of Phar Lap Software Inc.'s386/DOS-Extender.andM;Simplified OperationandM;PC Week tested AutoCAD 386 on a Compaq Computer Corp.andP;  Deskpro 386/20equipped with a VGA display and 8M bytes of RAM running Compaq MS-DOS 3.31.andO;On a 386-based system, AutoCAD 386 needs an Intel Corp. floating-pointcoprocessor, either an 80287 or an 80387.andP;  486-based systems do not requirean additional coprocessor because the necessary circuitry is built into themain chip.andM;AutoCAD 386 demands at least a 20M-byte hard disk, although the program andits related files consume only about 2.5M bytes; the supplied sample filesswallow another 1M byte.andM;The program also requires a minimum of 2M bytes of RAM, of which 640K bytesmay be devoted to real-mode (DOS) memory.andP;  At least 1M byte of extendedmemory must be available for the exclusive use of AutoCAD 386.andM;Compared with unenhanced release 10 -- that is, without optimizing its memorymanagement or using RAM disks -- AutoCAD 386's performance gains weresubstantial.andP;  AutoCAD 386 was able to draw five times faster than release 10.andM;On the complex four-view CHAIR-3D sample file provided with AutoCAD, forexample, release 10 was able to fully render the entire screen in about 20seconds.andP;  AutoCAD 386 drew it in 14 seconds.andM;Even a mild degree of tuning to AutoCAD release 10, however, such as puttingoverlays and temporary drawing files on a RAM disk, shaved 1 second from itsdrawing time.andP;  This sort of tweaking did not appreciably alter theperformance of AutoCAD 386.andM;Besides being faster overall, AutoCAD 386 is clearly more forgiving.andP;  Anycarelessness in setting up release 10 severely penalized its overallperformance.andM;For instance, putting several memory-resident utilities in the DOS memoryarea deprived the program of required resources and extended the CHAIR-3Ddrawing time to 75 seconds.andP;  This same abuse had no effect on the drawingspeed of AutoCAD 386.andM;Part of AutoCAD's performance increase can be attributed to the larger 32-bitinstructions in its machine-language code.andM;Because these commands load from memory into the microprocessor twice as fastas the 16-bit instructions used by 286 and 8088 microprocessors (one clockcycle vs.andP;  two), numerous extra cycles are trimmed.andP;  Moreover, the 386's32-bit instructions are somewhat more efficient, which also contributes toAutoCAD 386's performance edge.andM;The 386's large protected-memory area yields another performance advantage:AutoCAD 386 comprises a single, large executable file that fits entirelywithin memory.andP;  As a result, no overlay files are required and the programloads into memory faster.andM;The huge program size, however, incurs a couple of penalties.andP;  Loading allthat code into RAM at one time takes longer than dumping DOS code into the512K bytes of program memory used by release 10, which means that it takesmore time to start AutoCAD 386.andM;On the test system, release 10 loaded into memory in 3.6 seconds; AutoCAD 386took 8.6 seconds to load.andM;The difference probably will not be bothersome for those who work in AutoCAD386 for extended periods.andP;  Those who graze on a variety of applicationsduring the course of a day, however, may be irked by the extra wait whilethose megabytes pile into RAM.andM;The contrast in performance between the two versions may be mitigated by theneed to load release 10's overlay files into a RAM disk to optimize itsperformance.andP;  Starting release 10 from a batch file, which also transferredits overlays to a RAM disk, doubled the time required to reach the main menu,extending the loading time to 6.7 seconds.andM;Adding RAM beyond the minimum required by AutoCAD 386 improves the program'sperformance on larger drawings because it is designed to take advantage ofthe entire 4-gigabyte addressing range of the 386 microprocessor.andM;Most 386-based computers are limited to 16M bytes of actual RAM due tohardware-addressing limitations.andP;  AutoCAD 386 can work with drawing fileslarger than 16M bytes, however, via a virtual-memory technique that usesdisk-based memory to mimic additional RAM.andM;Consequently, the largest drawing size possible with AutoCAD 386 approaches 4gigabytes -- effectively an unlimited drawing size.andM;With larger drawings, more real RAM adds speed because less paging to disk isrequired.andP;  The recommended 4M bytes of RAM allows drawing files over 1.5Mbytes to be held solely within RAM, which should be sufficient for mostapplications.andM;Memory ManagementandM;All of the RAM to be used by AutoCAD 386 must be configured as extendedmemory.andP;  Although it does not recognize or use Lotus/Intel/MicrosoftExpanded-Memory Specification (LIM EMS) memory, it will reside withexpanded-memory managers that follow the Phar Lap/Quarterdeck Virtual ControlProgram Interface.andP;  These include the latest versions of Quarterdeck OfficeSystems' QEMM and Qualitas Inc.'s 386Max.andM;On the test system, the program appeared to behave well with other memorymanagers.andP;  A degree of safety with unsupported memory managers can beachieved by using some of the memory-control options of the Phar Lap386/DOS-Extender, but tangling with these is contrary to the no-headachesinstallation philosophy of AutoCAD 386.andM;AutoCAD 386's use of extended memory releases more DOS memory area fordrivers, networking programs and memory-resident software.andP;  AutoCAD 386consumes only 220K bytes of DOS memory.andP;  The balance of the program's codeand all of its data load into the high-memory area above the 1M byteaccessible by DOS.andM;On the downside, this memory is used by the Phar Lap 386/DOS-Extenderwhenever AutoCAD 386 is loaded.andP;  If users shell out to DOS, then less memorymay be available for running applications than under AutoCAD release 10.andM;Again, the difference depends on how release 10 was tuned.andP;  Nevertheless, ofthe 640K bytes of DOS memory in the test computer, AutoCAD 386 provided393.5K bytes in the shell environment, sufficient for all but the largestapplications and utilities.andM;Buyers Want Speed and Get ItandM;Speed proved to be the important issue for most but not all AutoCAD buyers.andO;Those who treasured performance wanted the boost promised by AutoCAD 386, andthen some.andM;&quot;I've been really happy with the overall performance of AutoCAD 386,&quot; saidRobert Posma Jr., senior electrical engineer for Fryer/Pressley Engineeringin Anchorage, Ala.andP;  &quot;In some things, such as screen regens, I would say thatit's close to 50 percent faster.&quot;andM;Tandy Willeby, curriculum director for MicroCAD Education Center in Austin,Texas, which specializes in AutoCAD training, also found an impressiveimprovement in performance under AutoCAD 386.andM;&quot;I have a benchmark that runs on normal release 10 in about 12 minutes,&quot; saidWilleby.andP;  &quot;Take pains with memory management and virtual disks andeverything, and the benchmark time will drop down to 7 minutes on a machinewith 3M bytes of RAM.andP;  [But by] just loading the 386 version, the benchmarkwill run in 5 minutes.&quot;andM;Most users were impressed with the improved speed of AutoCAD 386's screenregeneration, although they said other performance gains were equallyimportant.andM;Willeby found output processing, for example, to be similarly acceleratedwith AutoCAD 386.andP;  &quot;Processing PostScript files with hidden lines isconsiderably faster,&quot; claimed Willeby.andP;  &quot;Instead of days, it takes hours.&quot;andM;One PostScript file he created -- a complex three-dimensional drawing ofworkstations used by his training center -- required five days to processusing release 10.andP;  AutoCAD 386 cut that time in half.andM;The speed increases of AutoCAD 386 are apparent chiefly to those who placeheavy demands on the program by working with large drawings.andM;Others noted one aspect of AutoCAD 386 that is actually slower than itspredecessor.andP;  &quot;Some [users] go in and out of AutoCAD 386 with batch files,and they've complained about poor performance loading the program,&quot; saidPosma.andM;&quot;It takes a little while for the program to start,&quot; agreed Willeby.andP;  &quot;It's anoticeable hesitation.andP;  Compared to release 10, it takes considerably longerto get into the program.andP;  Once you're in, however, it's like greasedlightning.&quot;andM;Some buyers said they were not impressed by AutoCAD 386's performancebenefits.andP;  &quot;Because we have files that may be several megabytes in size,zooms and screen regenerations are a big hassle to wait for, even when youtry to do everything to minimize them,&quot; said David Helinski, plantmaintenance supervisor for Saint Francis Hospital in Tulsa, Okla.andP;  &quot;It needsto be seconds, not minutes.andP;  I'd like to see a regen in less than 15seconds.&quot;andM;Other issues may crowd out the user's need for speed, some users reported.andM;&quot;Speed is very important to use because we do a lot of large assemblydrawings,&quot; said John Beeman, design engineer for Mead Products EngineeringInc., in Dayton, Ohio.andP;  &quot;But I don't think the upgrade is worth it at thispoint.andP;  Our [16MHz 386-based systems] are fast enough.&quot;andM;In fact, some users believe that speed should not be an all-consuming passionand that AutoCAD's increased performance may be unnecessary for many who canget along with what release 10 delivers.andM;&quot;You reach a point where you don't have any need for more performance, likehaving a car that will go 300 mph,&quot; said James Earle, professor ofengineering design graphics in the civil engineering department of Texas Aandamp;MUniversity in College Station.andM;New Installation ProcessandM;The other major change that distinguishes AutoCAD 386 from unenhanced release10 is its installation procedure.andM;The new program takes advantage of a query-based automatic installationprogram that copies all AutoCAD files to an appropriate, user-specifiedhard-disk directory.andM;While this new installation program worked well, it did not prove to be muchof an improvement over the old procedure -- earlier AutoCAD programs simplyrequired wild-card copying from floppy to hard disk.andP;  Either process on thetest computer took about 10 minutes.andM;AutoCAD 386's installation procedure is slightly serendipitous.andP;  Theprogram's large size mandates some form of installation procedure morecomplex than the copy command.andM;The entire program simply won't fit on a single floppy disk.andP;  Compared withthe path taken by competitors -- the use of the DOS RESTORE command totransfer large program files -- the new installation program is a reliableand reassuring choice.andM;As with its predecessors, AutoCAD 386 provides a configuration menu forchoosing a digitizer, pointing device, plotter, printer and video-displaysystem.andM;That's about all the configuring that AutoCAD 386 requires.andP;  The varied andfancy tricks used to eke more speed out of release 10 are unnecessary withAutoCAD 386.andP;  For the most part, such tinkering is counterproductive anyway,stealing resources without yielding any gain.andM;A RAM disk, for example, steals memory from AutoCAD 386's direct reach andmakes access to it more circuitous.andP;  On reasonably sized files, theperformance difference between such configurations appeared negligible.andM;Although Autodesk does supply a configuration program for the Phar Lap 386/DOS-Extender, most users should never need to alter its predefined softwareswitches.andM;AutoCAD 386's regular operation does not require any kind of hardware key.andM;Buyers Sweat over Fine-TuningandM;According to most buyers interviewed, installing release 10 was notdifficult, so AutoCAD 386's easy installation was not a significantimprovement.andP;  In fact, many users reported that their dealers had performedthe installation duties.andM;&quot;We had an outside contractor install it, so the process was not important touse at all,&quot; said Mead Products Engineering's Beeman.andM;Those who installed AutoCAD release 10 themselves were not bothered by theneed to use DOS to copy files.andP;  Those who had installed both the old and newAutoCADs, however, did favor AutoCAD 386's automated procedure.andM;&quot;I liked the installation of AutoCAD 386,&quot; said Fryer/Pressley Engineering'sPosma.andP;  &quot;They've made it a lot simpler.&quot;andM;Users interviewed said the biggest problem with AutoCAD release 10 isoptimizing the operation of the program.andM;Any CAD program is a tight squeeze into the confines of DOS memory; AutoCADrelease 10 works around those limits with a number of technologies --expanded memory, overlay files and virtual memory.andM;&quot;I found that the installation of AutoCAD release 10 was easy,&quot; said ScottGoehri, system administrator at Sverdrup Corp., an engineering firm in St.andO;Louis.andP;  &quot;I had no difficulty with it, but I did have minor problems tuningthe system in terms of the setup of memory managers.andP;  It was nothing that Icouldn't overcome, however.&quot;andM;Some users reported that they have not perfected AutoCAD's memory management,even after months of operating the program.andM;&quot;I have attempted to tune AutoCAD,&quot; said St. Francis Hospital's Helinski.andO;&quot;In fact, I'm still tuning, and find it to be a definite problem.andM;&quot;I'm having the most difficulties with memory management,&quot; he added.andP;  &quot;If youhave memory-resident utilities, it's difficult to figure out why AutoCADcan't use all your memory.&quot;andM;Some users have resorted to third-party memory managers to squeeze more DOSmemory space from their systems.andM;&quot;Installation of AutoCAD release 10 wasn't that difficult,&quot; said Dave Greene,a designer for network manufacturer 10Net Communications of Dayton, Ohio.andO;&quot;The problem has been getting overlays into high memory.&quot;andM;AutoCAD 386 eliminates the tangled memory-tuning procedures.andP;  It deals onlywith extended memory and requires no extraneous memory managers.andM;Attempting to use any enhancements necessary for coaxing better performancefrom AutoCAD release 10, in fact, is likely to backfire with AutoCAD 386.andM;&quot;Try any of the classic AutoCAD speed- up tricks like disk caching, and theperformance of the 386 version actually slows down,&quot; said Willeby.andM;Same Old StoryandM;Apart from improved program speed and installation procedure, however,AutoCAD 386's basic features and functions are the same as release 10's.andM;Files created with other versions of AutoCAD, including those on differentplatforms and operating systems, are compatible with AutoCAD 386.andP;  Nodifficulty was experienced when files generated with unenhanced release 10were transported to AutoCAD 386.andM;The basic AutoCAD user interface remains unchanged in 386 -- a simpletext-mode menu links the principal functions of the program (configuration,drawing, plotting).andM;Both the AutoCAD 386's and release 10's main drawing function offers a dualinterface, operable both by command and menu.andP;  As would be expected, thecommand-driven mode of operation can be faster (and more accurate) forexperienced users.andP;  The menus are easier to learn to use.andM;A mouse, trackball or digitizing tablet, as well as other pointing devices,can be used both for freehand drawing and making menu selections in AutoCAD386.andP;  In fact, the program's Advanced User Interface -- a drop-down menusystem available with most graphics adapters -- can be used only with apointing device.andM;Use of a pointing device is restricted only in AutoCAD's perspective mode.andM;The repertoire of drawing commands under AutoCAD 386 is full andcomprehensive.andP;  The program was able to draw virtually anything that wasrequired in testing.andM;Since the introduction of release 10, AutoCAD has had full three-dimensionaldrawing capabilities, which are fully integrated with its two-dimensionalsystem rather than treated as a separate module.andP;  AutoCAD also supportsunlimited layering.andP;  Drawing commands can be referenced either globally orlocally (using AutoCAD's User Coordinate System).andM;AutoCAD 386 expands on the screen- splitting options of release 10 byoffering the ability to handle as many as 16 view ports (as do all 32-bitimplementations of AutoCAD).andP;  Unenhanced release 10 is constrained to fourview ports by memory limitations.andM;Documentation and support of AutoCAD 386 are virtually unchanged from release10.andP;  The product comes packaged with the same hardbound reference manual andtutorial booklet as included with release 10.andP;  Only the &quot;Installation andPerformance Guide&quot; is different, reflecting the new installation procedures.andM;The tutorial is adequate for introducing AutoCAD's basic drawing abilitiesthrough its command interface.andM;As with any product as powerful as a CAD system, however, one simple bookletis hardly sufficient to teach a system's capabilities or give the depth ofknowledge of the product that only comes with experience.andM;Enamored UsersandM;Users are generally satisfied with AutoCAD, particularly since theintroduction of release 10, which resolved many minor problems in addition toexpanding its capabilities.andM;Among the features pleasing to users was the dual interface, which allowedthem to match the program to their level of expertise in operating it.andM;&quot;The menus and pull-downs are great,&quot; said Helinski.andP;  &quot;But the keyboard is 50percent faster than the pull-downs and the sidebar.andP;  Menus are great when youare learning, but if you're looking for speed, you're going to use thekeyboard.&quot;andM;In fact, many of the more bothersome aspects of AutoCAD were related tolearning the complex program rather than defects in its design.andM;&quot;Managing system variables is difficult in my mind,&quot; explained Helinski.andP;  &quot;Idon't remember all the names of the variables to change and what changeswhat.&quot;andM;When pressed, however, users did note some weaknesses in the functions ofAutoCAD.andP;  In particular, they cited irregularities and imperfections in itsautomatic assignment of dimensions to drawings.andM;&quot;The weakest part of AutoCAD is its dimensioning,&quot; said Beeman.andP;  &quot;Say you'redimensioning a vertical dimension, then you don't have the option of whereyou want the text to appear.andM;&quot;A lot of times a new dimension will come in on top of other dimensions.&quot; headded.andP;  &quot;You have to break it, move it around or something.&quot;andM;10Net Communications' Greene also found minor problems with AutoCAD'sdimensioning.andP;  &quot;AutoCAD doesn't do dimensioning accurately when you'redrawing in a 30 degree plane,&quot; he noted.andP;  &quot;It's accurate pictorially, but notaccurate when you measure the dimension on the screen.&quot;andM;Users who are experienced with other CAD programs found that AutoCAD dealsdifferently with some functions, and these differences proved bothersome.andM;&quot;I've noticed that the definition of line types is a little unusual withAutoCAD,&quot; said Goehri, who uses AutoCAD for topographic site surveys.andO;&quot;AutoCAD defines a polyline from each of the vertices on the line.andP;  Whenvertices are close together, dashed polylines come out as solid lines.andP;  Thisdoesn't happen with another CAD system we use, Intergraph Corp.'s IntergraphMicrostation, which defines polylines from their endpoints.&quot;andM;For Greene, AutoCAD's method of panning across a drawing was slower than thatof another program he regularly uses.andP;  &quot;I don't like the way AutoCAD's panfunction works,&quot; said Greene.andP;  &quot;AutoCAD regens all the time when you pan.andO;Schema II, a schematic capture program that I also use, scrolls during a panwithout having to regen.&quot;andM;Output is another area in which users would like to see changes.andM;&quot;PostScript support could be a lot nicer for outputting to laser printers,&quot;said Fryer/Pressley Engineering's Posma.andM;&quot;The biggest problem I have is the mismatch between Hewlett-Packard plottersand AutoCAD when you use the FIT function,&quot; said Texas Aandamp;M's Earle.andM;Most full-featured CAD programs can create any drawing imaginable.andP;  Theprograms differ, however, in their approach to the workplace and CADenvironment.andP;  While most are primarily designers' tools, Autodesk Inc.'sAutoCAD 386 is also designed for customization, by both users and third-partyvendors.andM;For the user, AutoCAD offers its own programming language, AutoLISP, anoffshoot of the general-purpose LISP language.andP;  AutoLISP can be used toextend AutoCAD 386, such as adding commands to its repertory.andM;AutoCAD 386's implementation of AutoLISP remains essentially unchanged fromthe version used in AutoCAD release 10.andP;  It differs, however, in that theuser is freed from the bother of stack and memory management.andM;AutoCAD's open architecture allows third-party vendors to create extensionsand enhancements to the basic program.andP;  While AutoCAD 386 does not alter theopen-architecture philosophy, it adds another standard for developers to dealwith.andM;The widely used AutoCAD Display Interface (ADI) has been altered in AutoCAD386 to allow the use of display drivers running in protected-mode (extended)memory, creating a new ADI P386 driver format.andP;  This change requires a newdriver design that is incompatible with previous versions of AutoCAD (simplybecause they don't support protected-mode memory).andM;AutoCAD 386 can use these ADI P386 drivers and real-mode ADI revision 4drivers that were created for release 10.andP;  Autodesk supplies protected-modedrives for the Hercules graphics card, EGA and VGA display systems, as wellas real-mode drivers for CGA, MCGA and 8514/A graphics adapters.andM;-- Winn L.
