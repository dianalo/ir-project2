Sen. Max Baucus, chairman of the Senate internationaltrade subcommittee, told reporters that his plan would capJapan's car sales for seven years at the 1991 level, or 3.6million vehicles annually, on condition that Detroit uses thebreathing spell to raise its quality and performancestandards.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The time for gimmicks and Band-Aids is over,&quot; he said,referring to President Bush's belated efforts to increaseU.S. sales of cars and auto parts in Japan.   The Montana Democrat said he will introduce the plan tohis colleagues in the Senate today as a &quot;doable&quot; alternativeto the more Draconian, import-slashing measure sponsored bySen. Donald Riegle (D., Mich.) and House Majority LeaderRichard Gephardt (D., Mo.). The Gephardt-Riegle legislationwould require Japan to reduce its trade surplus with the U.S.over five years. The bill would put the burden ofaccomplishing this task on Japan.   The Baucus plan calls for bilateral negotiations to setcar-sale limits. But if those negotiations fail, tariffswould be imposed against Japanese imports to achieve the 1991sales level.   The proposed curbs would affect production of so-calledtransplants, or assembly facilities established in the U.S.by Japanese auto makers, as well as their exports. Japanesenameplate cars turned out by these U.S. facilities would besubject to limits unless the cars have at least 70% U.S.content.   The Big Three also must reduce their executive salaries to&quot;international levels,&quot; Sen. Baucus said.   Under the Baucus plan, the International Trade Commission,a quasi-judicial federal agency, would review the programevery two years and, if necessary, recommend adjustments. Thecommission could recommend scrapping the limits entirely ifthe Big Three domestic auto makers fail to increasesignificantly the quality and performance of their products.   Sen. Baucus said his plan is intended to encourage U.S.companies to reinvest more of their earnings in new plants,worker training and joint research.   The Bush administration is unlikely to accept either theGephardt-Riegel or Baucus formulas. &quot;We don't believe inlegislating markets or prices,&quot; a U.S. trade official said.But congressional aides aren't ruling out the possibilitythat the administration could act quietly to deter Japaneseauto makers from taking advantage of Detroit's currentvulnerability to the weak U.S. economy.   A spokesman for General Motors Corp. said yesterday thatthe No. 1 U.S. auto maker &quot;appreciates Sen. Baucus'sobjective of improving the current state of U.S.-Japaneseautomobile trade,&quot; but would prefer to resolve trade issuesthrough &quot;ongoing negotiations at the government and industrylevels.&quot; The spokesman said GM had no immediate reaction toSen. Baucus's proposal to limit executive salaries.   It's unlikely, however, that Detroit's auto makers willwelcome caps on executive salaries, or government review oftheir quality, as a quid pro quo for trade-protection.   The Japanese government is poised to reject the Baucusplan outright. &quot;It's managed trade,&quot; argued HiroshiHirabayashi, the deputy chief of mission of the JapaneseEmbassy here. He said the plan would violate multilateraltrade rules and the U.S.-Japan treaty of commerce, if theU.S. interfered with transplant production.   Japan currently has a self-imposed limit of 2.3 millioncars that it can ship to the U.S. annually. It is expected toreadjust that figure before its fiscal year ends March 31.There are no official limits, however, on the growth oftransplant production.</TEXT></DOC>
