In a government statement released in Riyadh andWashington, Hisham Nazer, the oil minister, reaffirmed SaudiArabia's commitment to the May 2 agreement by theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to reduce totalOPEC output by nearly 1.5 million barrels a day.</LP><TEXT>   The kingdom &quot;promised at the May OPEC meeting to abide byits quota&quot; of 5.4 million barrels a day, Mr. Nazer said. &quot;Itis still committed to what it promised.&quot;   But before the statement was issued, a near collapse ofoil prices followed published reports confirming discountsthat had been widely rumored for Saudi pricing formulas.According to Dow Jones International Petroleum Report, theplanned discounts will range between 25 cents and 70 cents abarrel.   In most areas, prices of crude oil were down 50 cents to60 cents a barrel before the Saudi statement was issued. Thestatement helped calm jittery oil markets some, and pricesrecovered slightly.   Still, on London's International Petroleum Exchange,Brent-blend crude futures settled 23 cents to 34 cents abarrel lower. In the U.S. futures market, prices of fuels inthe energy complex were all sharply lower. Some reachedlife-of-contract lows before recovering.   The July contract for crude oil traded on the New YorkMercantile Exchange fell through the technically importantlevel of $17 a barrel to a low of $16.42 before reboundingsome. It settled at $16.68 a barrel, down 46 cents for theday. The August crude contract fell 38 cents, to $17.39.   Some oil-market participants jumped to the conclusion thatthe Saudi price discounts were a prelude to a pricing warsuch as the one the kingdom launched in 1986. It was saidthat the Saudis were running out of patience with those OPECmembers continuing to produce beyond their quotas.   But there were indications that the discounts may havebeen needed to keep Saudi crudes competitive in the currentpricing environment with the big overhang of crude suppliesin inventories or at sea in tankers. &quot;The Saudi oilauthorities view their price moves as defensive and needed toprevent volumes falling below quota,&quot; reported theLondon-based Energy Compass.   In his statement, Mr. Nazer made clear that the kingdomonly promised at the May OPEC meeting to remain within itsproduction quota. Since &quot;Saudi Arabia has not pledged otherthan that,&quot; he said, &quot;it will be a baseless conclusion tolink the kingdom's commitment with the changing marketforces.&quot;   Meantime, there were new reports that total OPECproduction is beginning to decline, if only modestly. TheParis-based International Energy Agency released its monthlyestimate of world oil production showing OPEC's May output at23.4 million barrels a day, down 400,000 barrels from revisedApril figures.   After futures trading closed, the American PetroleumInstitute released its latest weekly U.S. oil statistics. TheAPI report showed big inventory increases of 2.5 millionbarrels in crude oil, 2.3 million barrels in gasoline and 4.1million barrels in distillates, including heating oil.   The immediate reaction in the cash market was negative,with U.S. spot prices of crude oil dropping a further 15cents a barrel. Also late yesterday, some U.S. refinersreduced their posted field prices for West Texas Intermediatecrude by 50 cents a barrel to $15.75. According to the APIreport, however, the nation's imports of petroleum alsodeclined in the latest week. &quot;That may be an indicationOPEC's production is indeed tapering off,&quot; said NaumanBarakat, first vice president at Shearson Lehman Hutton.   In other commodities markets yesterday:                                                                                                          GRAINS and SOYBEANS: The price of the corn futurescontract for July delivery rose 4.5 cents to settle at$2.7825 a bushel, as rains returned to the Midwest andtraders reasoned that this year's crop yields may be lessthan ideal. Farmers have been late planting corn through muchof the Midwest because of soggy spring conditions. Analystssaid the weather needs to be virtually perfect for the restof the growing season for yields to be strong. &quot;With all thismoisture and coolness and poor germination, you get shallowroot development,&quot; said Richard Loewy, president ofAgResource Co., Chicago. &quot;If the weather is very hot in July,it could kill off some of the crop,&quot; he said. Potential for aweak crop is being coupled with strong demand for cornproducts, analysts said. Corn is a major component oflivestock feed and the nation's cattle herd is expected toexpand this year. For these reasons, &quot;any perception of loweryield will be explosive on prices&quot; of corn-futures contracts,Mr. Loewy said.                                                                                                          COPPER: Futures prices rose. The thinly traded spot Junecontract, which will expire June 27, advanced 2.90 cents apound, to $1.1710, while the most-active July contract was up1.95 cents, to $1.1310. A price-supporting factor was thatholders of June call options in the London market declaredtheir intention of exercising their right to buy June futurescontracts, analysts said. In addition, two major U.S. miningcorporations, whose labor contracts expire June 30, have notyet reached agreements with their unions. The possibility ofproduction disruptions because of strikes is creating someuneasiness among traders, one analyst said. Peruvian copperoutput during the first four months of this year fell 29%from the year-earlier period because of strikes; Chilesuffered a loss of some 100,000 tons of refined-copper outputbecause of various production problems, analysts said. TheJuly futures price has fallen about 7%, or nine cents apound, during the past 3 1/2 weeks. Yesterday's low of$1.1020 a pound in the July contract was near the key supportlevel of $1.10, an analyst said. Some demand was triggered atthe low and helped the July price rebound. Another analystobserved that the $1.10 level was a &quot;crucial one.&quot; If theJuly price had fallen below it, he said, there likely wouldhave been a test of $1.05.                                                                                                          PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices rebounded from recentweakness, led by platinum. July-delivery platinum rose asmuch at $10 an ounce, to $497, before easing to settle at$492.30, up $5.50. August gold was up $1.20 an ounce at$363.60. July silver advanced 1.4 cents an ounce, to $5.0960.&quot;Platinum has been oversold and dragged down by gold andsilver,&quot; said Jacques Luben, executive director of thePlatinum Guild International, an industry group. &quot;The beliefamong traders is that it shouldn't have fallen as much as ithas, and the low prices attracted renewed demand for bullionfrom Japan,&quot; he said. This demand, in turn, touched off shortcovering, or the purchase of futures contracts that werepreviously sold by traders who thought prices were going tofall further. Stuart Shinbein, senior technical editor forCommodity Research Bureau, a New York unit of Knight-Ridder,observed that the lift in platinum, as well as in gold andsilver, was helped by a soft dollar. Further, Mr. Shinbeinsaid, demand for July platinum-futures contracts appearedwhen the price fell to the day's low of $487 an ounce. Thethree precious metals, he said, have declined significantlyfrom November highs. Platinum fell more than 10% from $556 inthat time. It hit a life-of-contract low of $446 in Aprilbefore recovering to present levels. July silver suffered anew low as it dropped 18% from its November high of $6.22.August gold, in falling 17% from $440 in November, is nearingthe $356-to-$360 area it reached in June and September of1989. Fred Demler, metals economist for PaineWebber, NewYork, noted that South African labor contracts atprecious-metals mines with the National Union of Mineworkersrun out July 1. There has been some unrest and wildcatwalkouts, he said, and as the deadline nears, concern isgoing to grow unless agreements are reached.                                                                                                          LIVESTOCK and MEATS: Prices of hogs and pork-belly futurescontracts rose sharply on rumors that the Soviet Union woulduse any credit guarantees it might receive from the U.S. tobuy meat, principally pork. As part of the recent summitbetween President Bush and Soviet President MikhailGorbachev, the U.S. proposed granting the Soviet Uniontrade-related credits if it eased emigration restrictions onSoviet Jews. The proposal is also subject to approval byCongress. A report released after the end of tradingyesterday showed higher-than-expected movement of frozen porkbellies from storage. &quot;That shows we're consuming bellies ata higher than normal rate,&quot; said Thomas Morgan, president ofSterling Research Corp., Arlington Heights, Ill. Pork belliesare uncured slabs of bacon.</TEXT></DOC>
