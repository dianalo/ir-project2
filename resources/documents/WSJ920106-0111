McLean</HL><DATE>01/06/92</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A14</SO><RE>NORTH AMERICA (NME)TEXAS (TX)UNITED STATES (US)</RE><LP>   Two outrages took place at Luby's Cafeteria in Killeen,Texas, in October. George Hennard's murder of 23 peoplegarnered all the publicity. But the fact that a madman couldcrash his truck through a cafeteria window, climb out andmethodically kill one-fifth of the patrons over a 10-minuteperiod without any of the 100 or so law-abiding privatecitizens having the means to resist is an outrage as well.   It is likely a number of those patrons owned firearms.Some may have been carrying firearms in their vehicles, asallowed by Texas law. But Texas law, and that of many otherstates, allows only sworn law enforcement officers to carryconcealed weapons on their persons. Texas law does allow oneto carry an unconcealed handgun. But try exercising this&quot;right to bear arms&quot; in a shopping mall or on a city streetwithout some recognizable law enforcement or security guarduniform.</LP><TEXT>   The first recorded examples of weapons control are foundin the Old Testament. The Judge Deborah remarks in hervictory song, &quot;Neither shield nor spear was seen among fortythousand in Israel&quot; (Judges 5:8). 1 Samuel 13:19-22 recordsthat the Philistines would not allow the Israelites to haveany blacksmiths &quot;lest the Hebrews make a sword or spear&quot; (1Samuel 13:19). As a result, on the day of the Israelites'battle with the Philistines, none of the 600 men with Sauland his son Jonathan were armed with swords or spears. OnlySaul and Jonathan had weapons.   The purpose of weapons control has not changed over thecenturies. Its goal is to control any segment of the governedpopulation seen as dangerous to the &quot;public safety.&quot;Governments have always found it easier to impose the &quot;willof the people&quot; upon the people if the people are unarmed. Thequestion that needs to be faced with as little emotionalbaggage as possible is &quot;who in the U.S. constitutes thepopulation we need to control with gun-control laws?&quot;   In spite of the great psychological and physical harm doneto individuals and our society as a whole by violentcriminals, no matter what weapon they use, violent criminalsstill represent a small percentage of our total population.Approximately 3% of the American population committed violentcrimes in 1990. The issue is how best to control that violentminority. Given our limited resources of both law enforcementpersonnel and finances, how can we best use them to lessenthe criminal abuse of weapons?   Well-crafted legislation allowing qualified privateAmerican citizens to carry a concealed weapon for the defenseof their own lives or the lives of others in a legitimate actof law enforcement would have made Hennard's attack unlikely;at the very least, it would have made it impossible for himto kill so many people.   It is no coincidence that the same criteria that make oneineligible to own any firearm are those that make oneineligible to vote-conviction on a felony charge,certification as mentally incompetent, or being an alien. Bywhat criteria have congressional supporters of morerestrictive gun legislation judged their constituentsincompetent to own and bear firearms safely and legally indefense of themselves and their communities from the violentcriminal minority?   The homicide rate in Florida fell after the permit tocarry laws were eased. The same is true of a similar easingof carry laws adopted in Oregon in 1989.   Ask yourself: Do I believe myself mentally and morallycompetent to own and bear arms, including a concealedhandgun, safely and legally in accordance with all local,state and federal regulations? Then contact your electedofficials and ask them if they believe they and theirconstituents are mentally and morally competent to do thesame.   If they don't have faith in their own mental and moralcompetence, do you want them to be your representatives ingovernment? Ask those who don't believe you and their otherconstituents are competent to own and bear arms what you havedone to warrant such a verdict against your ability tofunction as a competent citizen. Where does this radical lackof faith in the character of the American public come from?   How easy will it be for the next madman to find a group ofpeople to slaughter with nearly 100% assurance that none ofthem will be able to resist his onslaught? That will dependon the type of gun control legislation we embrace between nowand then.   ---   Mr. McLean, an associate professor of biblical studies andphilosophy at Evangel College, is a volunteer police chaplainin Springfield, Mo.
