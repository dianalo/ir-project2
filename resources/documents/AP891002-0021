The Senate slashed $900 million from President Bush's fiscal1990 request of $4.9 billion for Star Wars last Tuesday, then cameback two days later and restored two-thirds of the money.   What transpired in 48 hours were proclamations that the initialvote signaled the demise of the program, formally known as theStrategic Defense Initiative, introduced six years ago by PresidentReagan as a nuclear-age antidote to a strike against the UnitedStates.   There also was a negotiating session between House and Senateconferees thrashing out the defense authorization bill in whichconfident House members argued that the true Senate Star Warsnumber was the $3.7 billion adopted Tuesday in the appropriationsbill, not the $4.5 billion the Senate approved last month inauthorization legislation.   The House, which had agreed to $3.1 billion for the program,wanted a final figure closer to their total.   Faced with that argument, Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of theArmed Services Committee, took his case to the Senate for astronger negotiating position. He succeeded by a narrow margin,53-47.   Despite the win, lawmakers stressed that the House wouldn't befooled by the Senate reversal. Shortly after the second vote, someStar Wars opponents said so in no uncertain terms.   ``It tells you about the depth of their feelings,'' said Rep.Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., a member of the House Armed ServicesCommittee and one of the conferees.   ``Those kind of flip-flops don't make the Senate look veryserious,'' she added.   But on Friday some senators argued that they did nothing to foolthe House.   ``We're on record as supporting a higher number,'' said Sen.Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., a member of the Armed Services Committee.``The Senate signaled it did not want a significant cut.''   He added: ``There's nothing for the House to see through.''   While the authorizers enter their fifth week of negotiations ontheir respective defense plans, the appropriators are scheduled tobegin in another two weeks.   The House and Senate versions of the appropriations bills differgreatly on the major strategic weapons such as Star Wars, the B-2stealth bomber and land-based nuclear missiles. The two blueprintsalso include different funding totals for the Marine Corps' V-22Osprey, the vertical-takeoff plane, and the F-14D Tomcat jetfighter.   Bush had sought to cancel the two conventional programs.   In addition, the House slashed $1.1 billion for the AdvancedTactical Fighter plane while the Senate cut $1.8 billion earmarkedfor the Trident 2 nuclear missile, the submarine-launched weaponsthat has had two successive test failures.</TEXT></DOC>
