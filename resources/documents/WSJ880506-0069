The restrictions were designed to foster a strong domestic film-distribution industry that would invest in Canadian movie production. But the new proposed legislation is so weak that this is unlikely to occur, analysts said.    Under the new proposal, announced yesterday, U.S. movie companies will keep the right to distribute in Canada movies and videos made by independent producers, although now they will have to negotiate separate contracts for Canadian distribution. Until now, U.S. distributors have typically contracted with producers to buy North American rights to films.    Under the previous plan, announced a year ago, non-Canadians were restricted to distributing only films they had produced or for which they held the world rights, which would have barred U.S. companies from distributing in Canada such box-office successes as &quot;Crocodile Dundee&quot; or &quot;Return to Snowy River.&quot;    The independently produced segment, representing about 15% of Hollywood studios' market share in Canada, is a lucrative and growing market for the U.S. industry.    The U.S. movie industry had mounted a strong lobby against Canada's first proposal, fearing it would set a precedent that other countries might follow.    Sen. Pete Wilson (D. Calif.) had called on Washington to retaliate against Canada if it enforced the restrictive policy. He suggested forcing divesture of large Canadian investments in the U.S. publishing and cable-television industries. Trade sources said President Reagan took a personal interest in the issue because of his close ties to the Hollywood movie industry.    In Canada, independent movie distributors reacted negatively to yesterday's announcement. &quot;It doesn't resemble anything we saw last year,&quot; said Victor Loewy, president of the distribution arm of Alliance Entertainment Corp., Toronto. &quot;It will meet with no opposition from U.S. distributors.&quot; In Washington, a spokeswoman for the Motion Picture Association of America, representing major U.S. studios, declined to comment.    The Canadian industry has been particularly upset by a memo leaked to the Toronto Star newspaper that indicated the Canadian government worked closely with Hollywood in revising the legislation. The memo reportedly was sent to the Motion Picture Association by Millard Roth, president of the group's Canadian affiliate.    According to the Star, the memo said the association could undertake &quot;quiet collaboration&quot; with the government on wording of the rules, but should be &quot;clearly perceived as being opposed&quot; to the bill. Mr. Roth didn't return telephone calls.    Flora MacDonald, Canada's Minister of Communications, said the government heard &quot;valid concerns&quot; from &quot;many parties,&quot; including independent movie producers from the U.S., Australia, and Britain, before revising its proposals.    She said one concern was that the U.S. majors would respond to a restrictive Canadian law by pressuring the independents to give up world rights to their films, so that the majors could retain the profitable Canadian market.    Miss MacDonald said Canada will be &quot;a distinct, separate, national market&quot; under the proposed law. She said stiff penalties will be levied if distributors can't prove that Canadian rights to a film were negotiated separately from U.S. rights.    The government also said it will bar foreign takeovers of Canadian-owned movie distributors and restrict the establishment of new foreign distributors retroactive to February 1987. Such investments were subject to government approval.    The government promised to provide 200 million Canadian dollars ($161.9 million) over five years to support Canadian movie production and distribution. </TEXT></DOC>
