Box 3744, San Francisco, CA 94119, proposingthat andSection; 176.180 <T3>Components of paper and paperboard in contact with dry food </T3>(21CFR 176.180) be amended to provide for the safe use of a mixture of substitutedpolyethy1ene glycol succinates in the manufacture of paper and paperboardused in contact with dry food. FDA, in its evaluation of the safety of this additive, has reviewed theproposed nomenclature for the additive and the safety of both the additiveand the starting materials used to manufacture the additive. The agencyconcludes that a more appropriate name for this additive is mono- and di(2-alkenyl)succinylesters of polyethylene glycol containing not less than 90 percent of thediester product and in Which the alkenyl groups are derived from olefinsthat contain not less than 95 percent of C<T2>15</T2>-C<T2>21</T2> groups. The agency also finds that although the additive hasnot been found to cause cancer, it may contain minute amounts of ethyleneoxide and 1,4-dioxane as impurities carried through the production process.Ethylene oxide and 1,4-dioxane have been shown to cause cancer in testanimals. Residual amounts of reactants and impurities in reactants, suchas these chemicals, are commonly found as contaminants in chemical products,including food additives. <ITAG tagnum="84">I. Determination of Safety</ITAG>Under section 409(c)(3)(A) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act(the act) (21 U.S.C. 348(c)(3)(A)), the so-called ``general safety clause''of the statute, a food additive cannot be approved for a particular useunless a fair evaluation of the data available to FDA establishes thatthe additive is safe for that use. The concept of safety embodied in theFood Additives Amendment of 1958 is explained in the legislative historyof the provision: ``Safety requires proof of a reasonable certainty thatno harm will result from the proposed use of an additive. It does not_andcannot_require proof beyond any possible doubt that no harm will resultunder any conceivable circumstance.'' (H. Rept. 2284, 85th Cong., 2d Sess.4 (1958).) This definition of safety has been incorporated into FDA's foodadditive regulations (21 CFR 170.3(i)). The anticancer or Delaney clauseof the Food Additives Amendment (section 409(c)(3)(A) of the act (21 U.S.C.348(c)(3)(A)) provides further that no food additive shall be deemed tobe safe if it is found to induce cancer when ingested by man or animal.In the past, FDA has often refused to approve a use of an additive thatcontained or was suspected of containing even minor amounts of a carcinogenicchemical, even though the additive as a whole had not been shown to causecancer. The agency now believes, however, that developments in scientifictechnology and experience with risk assessment procedures make it possiblefor FDA to establish the safety of additives that contain a carcinogenicchemical but that have not themselves been shown to cause cancer. In the preamble to the final rule permanently listing Dandamp;C Green No.6, published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of April 2, 1982 (47 FR 14138), FDA explainedthe basis for approving the use of a color additive that had not been shownto cause cancer, even though it contains a carcinogenic impurity. Sincethat decision, FDA has approved the use of other color additives and foodadditives on the same basis. An additive that has not been shown to cause cancer, but that containsa carcinogenic impurity, may properly be evaluated under the general safetyclause of the statute using risk assessment procedures to determine whetherthere is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result from the proposeduse of the additive. The agency's position is supported by <T3>Scott v. FDA, </T3>728 F.2d 322 (6th Cir. 1984). That case involveda challenge to FDA's decision to approve the use of Dandamp;C Green No. 5,which contains a carcinogenic chemical but has itself not been shown tocause cancer. Relying heavily on the reasoning in the agency's decisionto list this color additive, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuitrejected the challenge to FDA's action and affirmed the listing regulation.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Safety of Petitioned Use </ITAG>FDA estimates that the petitioned use in paper and paperboard productsthat contact dry food of the additive mono- and di(2-alkenyl)succinyl estersof polyethylene glycol containing not less than 90 percent of the diesterproduct and in which the alkenyl groups are derived from olefins that containnot less than 95 percent of C<T2>15</T2>-C<T2>21</T2> groups will result in levels of exposure to this additive thatare quite small. FDA does not ordinarily consider chronic testing to benecessary to determine the safety of an additive whose use will resultin such low exposure levels (Refs. 1 and 2), and the agency has not requiredsuch testing here. However, the agency has reviewed available acute andsubchronic studies in the rat and a mutagenicity test with the additive.No adverse effects were reported in these studies. As stated above, the additive may Contain 1,4-dioxane and ethylene oxide,substances that have been shown to cause cancer in test animals. Theseimpurities may be present as a result of impurities in reactants used toproduce the additive. Because the additive itself has not been shown tocause cancer, however, the anticancer clause does not apply. FDA has evaluated the safety of this additive under the general safetyclause, considering all available data and using risk assessment proceduresto estimate the upper bound limit of risk presented by the carcinogenicchemicals, 1,4-dioxane and ethylene oxide, that may be present as impuritiesin the additive. Based on this evaluation, the agency has concluded thatthe additive is safe under the proposed conditions of use. The risk assessment procedures that FDA used in this evaluation are similarto the methods that the agency has used to examine the risk associatedwith the presence of minor carcinogenic impurities in various other foodand color additives that contain carcinogenic impurities (49 FR 13018;April 2, 1984). This risk evaluation of the carcinogenic impurities hastwo aspects: (1) Assessment of the worst-case exposure to the impuritiesfrom the proposed use of the additive; and (2) extrapolation of the riskobserved in the animal bioassays to the conditions of probable exposureto humans.A. 1,4-Dioxane Based on the fraction of the daily diet that may be in contact with surfacescontaining the additive mono- and di(2-alkenyl)succinyl esters of polyethyleneglycol containing not less than 90 percent of the diester product and inwhich the alkenyl groups are derived from olefins that contain not lessthan 95 percent of C<T2>15</T2> C<T2>21</T2> groups, and assuming 100 percent migration of the 1,4-dioxanethat could be present in the paper containing the additive, FDA estimatedthe hypothetical worst-case exposure to 1,4-dioxane to be 4.5 nanogramsper person per day (Ref. 5). The agency used data from a carcinogenesisbioassay on 1,4-dioxane conducted for the National Cancer Institute (Ref.4) to estimate the upper bound level of lifetime human risk from the exposureto this impurity that might result from the proposed use of the additive.The results of the bioassay on 1,4-dioxane demonstrated that the materialwas carcinogenic for female rats under the conditions of the study. Thetest material caused significantly increased incidence of squamous cellcarcinomas and hepatocellular tumors in female rats. The Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition's Cancer Assessment Committee(the Committee) reviewed this bioassay and other relevant data availablein the literature and concluded that the findings of carcinogenicity weresupported by this information on 1,4-dioxane. The Committee further concludedthat the 1,4-dioxane bioassay provided the appropriate basis on which tocalculate an estimate of the upper bound level of lifetime risk from potentialexposure to 1,4-dioxane stemming from the proposed use of the additive.The agency used a quantitative risk assessment procedure ( linear proportionalmodel) to extrapolate from the dose used in the animal experiment to thevery low doses encountered under the proposed conditions of use. This procedureis not likely to underestimate the actual risk from very low doses andmay, in fact, exaggerate it because the extrapolation models used are designedto estimate the maximum risk consistent with the data. For this reason,the estimate can be used with confidence to determine, to a reasonablecertainty, whether any harm will result from the proposed conditions andlevels of use of the food additives. Based on a worst-case exposure of 4.5 nanograms per person per day, FDAestimates that the upper bound limit of individual lifetime risk from thepotential exposure to 1,4-dioxane from use of the subject additive is 1.6andmultiply;10^10,or less than 2 in 10 billion (Ref. 6). Because of numerous conservatismsin the exposure estimate, lifetime averaged individual exposure to 1,4-dioxaneis expected to be substantially less than the estimated daily intake, and,therefore, the calculated upper bound limit of risk would be less. Thusthe agency concludes that there is a reasonable certainty of no harm fromthe exposure to 1,4-dioxane that might result from the proposed use ofthe additive. B. Ethylene Oxide  Based on the fraction of the daily diet that may be in contact with surfacescontaining the additive mono- and di(2-alkenyl)succinyl esters of polyethyleneglycol containing not less than 90 percent of the diester product and inwhich the alkenyl groups are derived from olefins that contain not lessthan 95 percent of C<T2>15</T2>-C<T2>21</T2> groups (Ref. 5), FDA estimated the hypothetical worst-caseexposure to ethylene oxide from the use of the additive to be 4.5 nanogramsper person per day. The agency used data from a carcinogenesis bioassayon ethylene oxide conducted by the Institute of Hygiene, University ofMainz, Federal Republic of Germany (Ref. 3), to estimate the upper boundlevel of lifetime human risk from the exposure to this impurity that mightresult from the proposed use of the additive. The results of the bioassayon ethylene oxide demonstrated that the material was carcinogenic for femalerats under the conditions of the study. The test material caused significantlyincreased incidence of squamous cell carcinoma of the forestomach and carcinomain situ of the glandular stomach. The Committee reviewed this bioassay and other relevant data availablein the literature and concluded that the findings of carcinogenicity weresupported by this information on ethylene oxide. The Committee furtherconcluded that the ethylene oxide bioassay provided the appropriate basison which to calculate an estimate of the upper bound level of lifetimerisk from potential exposure to ethylene oxide stemming from the proposeduse of the additive. Based on a worst-case exposure of 4.5 nanograms per person per day, FDAestimates that the upper bound limit of individual lifetime risk from thepotential exposure to ethylene oxide from the use of the subject additiveis 8andmultiply;10^\9\, or less than 8 in 1 billion (Ref. 6). Because ofnumerous conservatisms in the exposure estimate, lifetime-averaged individualexposure to ethylene oxide is expected to be substantially less than theestimated daily intake, and, therefore, the calculated upper bound limitof risk would be less. Thus, the agency concludes that there is a reasonablecertainty of no harm from the exposure to ethylene oxide that might resultfrom the proposed use of the additive.<ITAG tagnum="84"> III. Need for Specifications</ITAG> The agency has also considered whether specifications are necessary tocontrol the amounts of 1,4-dioxane and ethylene oxide in the additive.The agency finds that specifications are not necessary for the followingreasons: (1) Because of the low levels at which 1,4-dioxane and ethyleneoxide may be expected to remain as impurities following production of theadditive, the agency would not expect these impurities to become componentsof food at other than extremely low levels; and (2) the upper bound limitof lifetime risk from exposure to these impurities, even under worst-caseassumptions, is very low, less than 2 in 10 billion for 1,4-dioxane andless than 8 in 1 billion for ethylene oxide.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Conclusion on Safety </ITAG>FDA has evaluated the data in the petition and other relevant materialand concludes that the proposed use of the additive in paper and paperboardproducts in contact with dry food is safe, and that andSection; 176.180 (21CFR 176.180) should be amended as set forth below. In accordance with andSection; 171.1(h) (21 CFR 171.1(h)), the petition andthe documents that FDA considered and relied upon in reaching its decisionto approve the petition are available for inspection at the Center forFood Safety and Applied Nutrition by appointment with the information contactperson listed above. As provided in 21 CFR 171.1(h), the agency will deletefrom the documents any materials that are not available for public disclosurebefore making the documents available for inspection. The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effectsof this action. FDA has concluded that the action will not have a significantimpact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statementis not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and theevidence supporting that finding, contained in an environmental assessment,may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. <ITAG tagnum="84">V.
