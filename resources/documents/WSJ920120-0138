The suit alleges that the companies defrauded investors byfailing to disclose the information. Authorities have beeninvestigating health risks of the implants, made by DowCorning. The suit alleges that Dow Corning internal documentsindicate that the company may have rushed the implants ontothe market in 1975 without performing adequate safety tests.</LP><TEXT>   Dow Corning, owned 50-50 by Corning and Dow Chemical, saidlast week that the implants are safe and that its studieswere extensive.   The suit was filed in federal court in New York City byJoseph Reiss, a Corning shareholder from New York. The suitseeks to be made a class action on behalf of all Corningshareholders who bought the stock between Jan. 13, 1989, andJan. 13, 1992. On Jan. 13, 1992, Corning's stock price fell$10.625 to close at $68.375 a share after it was reportedthat the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced amoratorium on the implants because of questions raised by theinternal Dow Corning documents.
