up to 128 devices can be linked to Fibrenet's ZAT128-1 cable via 16 ports, and the system's optional point-to-point ormulti-drop ring configurations make it suitable for connecting more than oneremote location.andM;-  o  -andM;Legent Corp, the successor company to Morino Inc and DuquesneandM;Systems Inc reports from the Duquesne base in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania thatit has formed a subsidiary in Japan to market and support all of the newcompany's system software products, including NetSpy, TPX, AutoMate and MICSinformation management system.andM;-  o  -andM;Cognos Inc chose Brussels to announce several new products forandM;Hewlett-Packard Co users, including a Unix version of the PowerHouseapplications generation language under HP-UX and plans for support of thePowerHouse StarBase relational database management system on HewlettPrecision Architecture systems running the MPE/V XL-based systems, whichfeature a screen painter.andM;-  o  -andM;L M Ericsson Telephone Co told New York analysts it sees improvedandM;financial performance for 1989 after a record year in 1988: president BjornSvedberg said he expects a substantial sales growth reflecting volumeincreases in Ericsson's core businesses, and while Europe will remain a keymarket for all three of Ericsson's main telecommunications systems - the AXEtelephone exchange, the MD110 PABX and the cellular radio system built aroundthe AXE switch, Ericsson's success in cellular mobile telephony hasestablished itself as the number three supplier, with a 25% share of therapidly growing market; improved cash flow has made it possible to reduceshort term debt and interest payments, but Ericsson will continue to investheavily in research and development - which swallowed up 11.3% of turnover in1988.andM;-  o  -andM;BP International is replacing its analogue system at two sites inandM;Harlow and Moorgate with a 7,200-extension Sopho-S2500 network from PhilipsBusiness Systems: the system consists of six Sopho-S nodes in BP's BritannicHouse Complex in Moorgate and two at its Harlow site, and means that bothsites can be serviced through a single exchange; BP chose the network becauseit is modular, enabling staff to switch over more easily and offers completedigital networking between different PABXs; and, as BP is happy to point out,with 1992 approaching, Philips also scores points for being European.andM;-  o  -andM;Terrano Corp, Lincoln, Nebraska, has sold one of its ILS-5andM;Laboratory Information Systems, running on an IBM AS/400 to the MemorialHospital of Dodge County in Fremont, Nebraska, the first sale of the systemon the AS/400: the system also includes the ANSIRS Anatomical SurgicalInformation Retrieval System, Transfusion Service System, AdvancedMicrobiology, Laboratory Management, Query/Report Writer Module, multipleinstrument interfaces and a complete interface to Memo's hospital informationsystem.andM;-  o  -andM;Ameritech Mobile Communications is teaming up with Sears Roebuck andamp;andM;Co and putting marketing of cellular phones and service through 10 SearsBrand Central stores in the Detroit metropolitan area from this month.andM;-  o  -andM;Zitel Corp, Milpitas, California, hitherto a specialist in solidandM;state secondary storage in the Burroughs mainframe market, is invadingAmperif Corp's turf by keeping things in the Unisys Corp family butdiversifying into similar products for the Sperry side of the house: theRAMdisk/1100 is designed to increase dramatically input-output performance ofSperry 1100 and 2200 mainframes;

in 1988, the company made a netprofit of $15m on turnover up 15% to $7,444m; the big AEG Olympia AG officesystems and equipment unit is still losing big money, and heavy investment atModular Computer Systems Inc helped put its foreign units into the red.andM;-  o  -andM;Fibre optic calling between the US and Japan over the new PacificandM;link 35% owned by ATandamp;T Co, 23% by Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co began Tuesday.andM;-  o  -andM;IBM UK has signed a co-operative marketing agreement with #3.5m-andM;a-year Quality Software Products Ltd, Gateshead, Tyne andamp;
