(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Margo Adams, who accused Wade Boggs ofbreaking faith with her and sued the Boston Red Sox star for $12million, has herself been accused of walking off with a coat thatwasn't hers.   Ms. Adams was cited for petty theft, a misdeameanor, and releasedon her own recognizance, said police Lt. Alan Kent.   She was accused of shoplifting a $258 coat from Nordstromdepartment store Sunday, Kent said.   In January, Ms. Adams, 33, pleaded guilty to eight counts ofusing a bank charge card that wasn't hers to run up $4,871 incharges at the same department store and at other businesses. Shewas ordered to make restitution and was placed on three years'informal probation.   Ms. Adams, a mortgage broker, is doing a nationwide tour topromote a two-part article in Penthouse magazine telling of heraffair with Boggs.   Ms. Adams claimed Boggs broke an oral contract to pay her forlost wages and for financial services rendered during theirfour-year relationship, which ended last spring. The accusations arelaid out in a lawsuit filed in Orange Count Superior Court last May.   The 4th District Court of Appeal ruled last month that Ms. Adamscould not seek $11.5 million in punitive damages. She alleged Boggsinflicted intentional emotional distress on her.   That means Ms. Adams could sue Boggs only for $500,000 _ theamount she claims he owes her for lost income and for herprofessional services during road trips she took with him over fourbaseball seasons.</TEXT></DOC>
