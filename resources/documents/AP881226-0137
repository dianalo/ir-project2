The maneuvering involves skillful political manipulation bythe tobacco industry to obtain exemption from every law andauthority designed to protect the public from hazardous substances.''   She says that with falling domestic demand, the industry isaiming more at foreign markets, especially the Third World and Asia,where, for instance, 63 percent of men in Japan smoke, 70 percent inChina. Only 27 percent of American men smoke, she says.   Furthermore, American cigarettes sold abroad are far higher intars and nicotine than domestic brands.   Indeed, those 25 years ago when the surgeon general firstattacked smoking, most smokers cut down and looked to the industryto provide them with safer cigarettes, which the industry did.Opponents, who had pressed for safer cigarettes, then pressed fornone at all.   The strength of the new attack on smoking has the fervor and therationale of ``Mothers Against Drunk Drivers.'' The National Academyof Sciences in 1986 legitimized studies that held that non-smokerswere endangered by environmental tobacco smoke, called ETS.   That same year, the surgeon general said 20 years of accumulatingevidence allowed the verdict: ``It is now clear that disease riskdue to the inhalation of tobacco smoke is not limited to theindividual who is smoking, but can extend to those who inhaletobacco smoke emitted into the air.''   While urging changes, he emphasized that those changes ``shouldnot be designed to punish the smoker.''   ``Cigarette smoking is an addictive behavior, and the individualsmoker must decide whether or not to continue that behavior;however, it is evident from the data presented in this volume thatthe choice to smoke cannot interfere with the non-smokers' right tobreathe air free of tobacco smoke.''   While the studies have been criticized, they are largelystatistical and have not been refuted. But since many smokers have aguilty conscience about their habit anyway, efforts to fight off theincreasing repression make little headway.   Not that there have not been efforts. Philip Morris publishes aglossy, entertaining magazine that has become a rallying point forsmokers militant enough to fight back. Introduced in 1985 with acirculation of 150,000, the free magazine claims a circulation todayof 12 million and a readership of 24 million.   It reports local and national efforts to restrict the rights ofsmokers and provides a vent for some of the emotions of those whofeel they are persecuted by the non-smoking movement.   Publisher Guy Smith explains that its surveys produce a profileof the American smoker that should command attention in themarketplace.   ``We want Detroit to know that smokers buy cars _ a lot of cars.Furthermore, we want Detroit to know that although some peoplecomplain about cars with ashtrays, there are still millions of carowners who smoke and use ashtrays.''   If the message is aimed at automakers, it is also aimed atpoliticians, restaurateurs and others who serve the general public.   Consider the Philip Morris statistics: Smokers own 35 millioncars, 5 million of them new last year; they have 38 million TV sets,23 million VCRs, 5 million home computers, 30 million credit cards.Sixty-five percent of them are married and 40 percent have children.Almost 90 percent are registered voters and the vast majority saidthey voted in the last election. They are affluent, educated, activein community affairs and charitable organizations. Every day, 21million of them go out to eat.   That does not jibe with the statistics of the non-smokingmovement, which sees smoking as largely a blue-collar problem, theaffluent, better-educated having fled the smoking ranks.   Everybody's statistics show the number of women who smoke isbucking an otherwise downward trend, especially young women. Thenon-smoking people say this is especially disheartening, becausesmoking by a pregnant woman has been shown to be injurious to thefetus.   Some 35 million Americans have quit, most of them obeying thestrictures of the American Cancer Society, the American HeartAssociation, the American Medical Association and myriad otherhealth groups allied against smoking.   As a social experiment, the campaign for a smoke-free America hasmade remarkable strides. But it is not the first attempt to stompout the lowly weed.   They tried whipping in Russia and beheading in Turkey, and inthis country health issues were a prime motive in the late 1800s.Now it's local bans on smoking as in New York City and BeverlyHills, curtailed advertising and special taxes (35 cents more a packin California).   Today's anti-smoking movement is hard-nosed and persistent,thanks to federal involvement. It is an emotional confrontation.``The New Yorker'' magazine recently captured the angst in one ofits cartoons. The skyscrapers of Manhattan rise majestically intothe air, but their turrets and parapets are occupied by half-hiddenmembers of a SWAT team. Below, huddled and hidden in the darkshadows of the buildings, are two men, the last cigarette smokers inNew York City.</TEXT><NOTE>END ADV</NOTE></DOC>
