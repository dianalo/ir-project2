It was foundthat singly charged ion species have long tails in both the higher andlower energy regions of the energy distribution at two orders of magnitudebelow the peak ion current intensity. The higher energy ion tail canbe explained by charge transfer collision between doubly charged ionsand neutral atoms. The lower energy ion tail is caused by charge transfercollision and free space field ionization of neutral atoms. It was foundthat the energy distribution of singly charged Si/sup +/ depends stronglyon alloy systems. Si/sup +/ from the Pt-Si ion source exhibited no tailsin the energy spectrum. We also discussed this phenomenon with the fielddissociation model of Si cluster ions.</TEXT></DOC>
