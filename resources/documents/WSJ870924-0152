The tail is Germany's tiny Free Democratic Party, and the dog it wags is the Christian Democratic-led ruling coalition. The Free Democrats have staged a remarkable comeback from just a few years ago, when it looked as though the party and its leader, Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, might be headed for a political graveyard.    Now, the party's clout extends far beyond the 9% of the votes it received in the January national election. It is arguably the most potent political force in Germany today. And one person who understands that fact is Chancellor Helmut Kohl.    Mr. Kohl recently has shown a willingness to adopt Free Democratic positions, even at the risk of alienating the Christian Democrats' sister party, the conservative Christian Social Union of Bavaria. What the CSU says is a secondary matter, and Mr. Kohl knows it. While the disharmony may be damaging to the chancellor, keeping the Free Democrats content is of primary importance in retaining power.    Last month, for instance, Mr. Kohl reversed his stand against removal of Pershing 1-A missiles from German territory, paving the way for a superpower nuclear-arms pact. In doing so, he was not only bowing to U.S. pressure, he was also acquiescing to demands made by the Free Democrats.    Mr. Kohl also has been forced to accept further-reaching reductions in tax rates than he would have without pressure from the Free Democrats. Ultimately, however, the ascendance of the Free Democrats could be fatal for Mr. Kohl, because it limits his maneuverability and heightens dissension among the coalition partners.    Since its creation in 1948, the middle-of-the-road Free Democratic Party has had a greater say in German politics than its small size would normally command. Dwarfed by Germany's two dominant political parties, the Christian Democrats and the Social Democrats, it has been the swing party and, precisely because of this function, has held the balance of power for all but a handful of years since World War II. In 1982, the Free Democrats brought down Helmut Schmidt's Social Democratic government by throwing their parliamentary support behind Mr. Kohl's Christian Democrats.    But the Free Democrats now enjoy even greater leverage. A startling string of successes in state elections this year has given them representation in 10 of Germany's 11 state legislatures, double the number two years ago. In six states, they have formed or will soon form coalitions that permit the ruling party to govern.    As a result, for the first time in their history, the Free Democrats play a powerful role in a majority of Germany's state parliaments. That is important, because in Germany only the states have representation in the upper house of the federal parliament, the Bundesrat, which must approve many legislative matters (and all issues relating to tax and fiscal policy).    Only a few years ago, the Free Democrats, who adovocate conservative economic policies and liberal social policies, were struggling to win the 5% minimum vote required for representation in state and federal legislatures. Two years after toppling the Schmidt government, Mr. Genscher won only 62% of his own party's vote when running, unopposed, for re-election as chairman of the Free Democrats. Today he is the most popular politician in Germany by far, opinion polls say.    As Mr. Genscher goes, so goes his party. And his resurrection is partly due to factors beyond his control. The 60-year-old foreign minister, who has skillfully held that position for 13 years in successive governments, is a vocal proponent of arms control and his standing has risen with the thaw in U.S.-Soviet relations and the prospect of a superpower arms pact.    But Mr. Genscher has also done much to bolster his own standing. His decision in 1985 to hand over the chairmanship of the party to Economics Minister Martin Bangemann was a shrewd move, political observers say. It allowed him to concentrate on foreign policy, leaving the party's administration and economic matters to Mr. Bangemann.    &quot;There's no one better at sensing a trend,&quot; says one Free Democratic Party official. &quot;He has the best antenna in German politics.&quot;    Earlier this year, Mr. Genscher declared that the West would be making a &quot;mistake of historical dimension&quot; if it failed to trust the Soviets in their arms-control offers, echoing a view shared by about 85% of Germans. On Monday, amid media fanfare, he flew to New York for talks with Secretary of State Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze after last week's announcement of a preliminary Euromissile arms pact.    All of this gives the Free Democrats an image as the &quot;peace-making&quot; member in the coalition, an image reinforced by the right-wing blustering of Franz Josef Strauss, head of the Christian Socialists and Mr. Genscher's arch-enemy.    Up to now, the Free Democrats have been selective in the use of their new-found power. But such restraint may not continue for long. Party Chairman Bangemann has been loudly proclaiming that 1987 is the &quot;year of the liberals.&quot; Adds one party strategist, &quot;We have more influence now and we intend to use it.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
