His job as assistant to the president for special activities andinitiatives has been offered to Sig Rogich, a political andadvertising consultant from Nevada. But Rogich is deciding whetherto take the job, Studdert said.   Studdert, 40, said he will return to Utah and has no presentplans to run for governor. But, he said, ``I don't close the dooron any option for the future.''   However, he said in an interview, Republican Gov. Norman H.Bangerter is a ``close personal friend'' and if Bangerter choosesto run again in 1992, ``I'd support him in a minute.''   Studdert's first assignment when he came to the White House tohead President Reagan's advance office was to coordinate the returnof the 52 American hostages who had been held captive in Iran for444 days.   That day, Jan. 20, 1981, brought what he called the mostpoignant moments of his life, he said.   He had obtained a Navy band at the last minute to meet thehostages at Andrews Air Force Base. ``I'll never forget thetrombone player marching by playing `Tie a Yellow Ribbon' withtears running down his cheeks,'' Studdert said.   Despite White House rumors that there was some agitation forStuddert's departure after a few presidential appearances did notgo smoothly, he said both Bush and Chief of Staff John Sununu``strongly counseled me to stay,'' and asked him to reconsider hisdecision to resign.   But he said he and his wife decided they wanted to return toUtah for a more quiet life with their six children in the tiny townof Highland.   When he agreed to join the Bush presidential campaign last yearStuddert said he had not really wanted to leave his privateconsulting business, nor did he particularly want to come back towork at the White House.   ``I just can't say no to the guy,'' he said of Bush. In hisresignation letter, the former advance man told Bush that duringhis years in Washington ``nothing has been more satisfying than toserve you and Mrs. Bush.''   He later told reporters: ``I have the best job in the entirefederal government. I have a fun job. I love what I do and Bushmakes it so. It's been very, very hard for me to make thisdecision.''   He said he has traveled ``almost 5 million miles'' in hisefforts to set up where the president will appear and how thoseappearances will look.</TEXT></DOC>
