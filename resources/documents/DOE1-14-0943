Metal-boron binding energies,which are used for calculating formation enthalpies of hypothetical boridesM/sub 3/B are calculated. A possibility of using {delta}H/sub form/(M/sub3/B) for evaluation of increasing thermostability of Fe-B system amorphousalloys, doped with transition metals, is demonstrated.</TEXT></DOC>
