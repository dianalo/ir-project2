<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-63-1129 </DOCNO><TEXT>The contaminants in feedwater have required utilities to take expensiveremedial actions in the steam generators of nuclear steam systems, includingcompletely replacing the heat transfer surface. This paper describesa consequence unique to the Babcock and Wilcox nuclear once-through steamgenerator - the potential for reduction of steam generation rate dueto increased flow resistance in the nucleate boiling region. Feedwaterflow and thereby power level has had to be reduced to prevent &quot;flooding&quot;of the downcomer. Hydraulically removing the deposits responsible forthe increased pressure drop has been partially successful. Chemical cleaningis expected to restore performance.</TEXT></DOC>
