Investment of your cash,equity, and trade credit should support these factors.andP;  Understand yourplayers.andP;  Understanding your personnel is important in order to help themincrease their strengths and over come their weaknesses.andP;  Infoffnation isalso a key player in managing your business.andP;  Determine what informationcould make you more effective in addressing the critical success factors youhave identified.andP;  (Helping to generate this information should be one of thefunctions of your .automated system.) Develop your overall game plan.andO;Develop your infon-nation systems strategy and plan for the whole game, notjust a 2-minute drill.andP;  Determine which information systems can deliver theinformation you identified in step 3.andP;  Avoid pitfalls based on four commonmyths.andM;* Myth: A poor manual system will be improved by automation.andP;  Developingprocedures and policy is equally necessary in an automated system and in amanual system.andP;  When overlooked, faulty procedures become the most frequentcauses of system failure.andM;* Myth: A wise systems developer will interview all users in advance.andP;  It'simportant to understand an individual's needs in your firm, but a longanalysis process can overwhelm the business of getting a solutionimplemented.andP;  Spend your time wisely.andP;  *Myth: You should automate as much aspossible.andP;  Pareto's Rule (the old 80/20 principle) holds here.andP;  Be preparedto make compromises; you can take care of 80 percent of your needs at 20percent of the cost of a &quot;total&quot; system.andP;  Automation of the remaining tasksbecomes inordinately expensive because of the customization required.andO;Therefore, you should not expect to eliminate all manual tasks, but yourprocedures can be revised as you reach new stages in the implementation.andO;Internal costs include initial training and the cost of your workers' time.andO;Effective use of outside help can make this investment more productive.andO;Outside assistance is also important because many professionals do not havethe time or personnel to assess their data processing requirements properly.andO;This process is particularly critical when you are considering a local areanetwork or larger multiuser system.andP;  Prepare the fundamental moves.andP;  It isnow time to review the basic elements of an automated accounting system.andO;Publications available from your local chapter of Certified PublicAccountants can help you understand the capabilities and benefits of such asystem.andM;When to automate? Consider it if youandM;* have more than 50 transactions related to a particular accounting functionduring the month;andM;* have more than three clerks in any single financial record-keeping area;andM;* spend over $500 a month for a service bureau;andM;* have processing requirements that are a good fit with an unmodifiedcommercial software package.andM;When automation looks feasible, perform a quick evaluation by readingsoftware reviews and examining potential selections.andP;  After narrowing downthe list of possible choices, do mi in-depth evaluation.andP;  Make sure that thepackage you buy meets your specific requirements and matches your style.andP;  Inselecting the fight system, look for value, not the lowest cost.andP;  Executecarefully.andM;When it's time to implement your information systems strategy:andM;* Prepare the users with a kickoff meeting and training so that theyunderstand their roles and responsibilities.andM;* Prepare the site.andP;  Make sure there is adequate electrical power andventilation; avoid excessive dust and extremes of temperature.andM;* Notify your insurance carrier.andP;  * Install the hardware and software.andP;  *andO;Design the security system and backup methods you will use.andP;  Here you cantake advantage of the features in the accounting packages as well asstandalone hardware or software.andP;  Practice.andM;It is often advisable to establish a set of books for systems training.andP;  Theexercises should include proper closedown procedures, backup procedures,crosstraining responsibilities, and security.andP;  Stick to the plan.andP;  Bepatient.andP;  Develop a sensible and controlled method for convening your manualdata.andP;  Often professionals run two parallel system, maintaining both a manualand an automated system until they are convinced that both yield the sameresults.andP;  Manage situations.andP;  Enforce logging of procedures checklists.andP;  Somesystems help automate recording of who performed what function and when.andO;Ensure that proper backup procedures are executed.andM;Stay current with the newsletters from your accounting package's vendor.andO;These should inform you of upcoming upgrades, improvements, or availablefixes to the code.andP;  Be prepared for system growth by scheduling usageintelligently, purging records frequently, and periodically evaluating theefficiency of your system.andM;Evolve the system.andP;  Conduct a review to evaluate what you've done well andwhat you could have done better.andP;  You should regularly be scouting for newfeatures, new assignments, and even new personnel to help increase the payofffrom your system.andM;The Price Waterhouse evaluation team is made up of 17 individuals from 14offices in the U.S.andP;

 This sampling spans a range of costs and capabilities .andP;  Foreach product the multiuser price for five basic modules: General Ledger(G/L), Accounts Payable (A/P), Accounts Receivable (A/R), Inventory, andOrder Entry (O/E)-is listed, plus the cost of a system manager or networkmanager and /or a database product, if needed.andM;Parker Systems' On the Money, Version 2.0, a new high-end multiuser package,costs $5,225 including DataFlex, the fourth-generation-language (4GL)multiuser database language in which it is written.andP;  An outstandingManagement Reports module adds $395.andP;  This puts the dozens of reports thatline managers most often need in a single module that automatically drawsdata from all the others.andP;  Normally you'd have to spend many hours with areport generator to get the same results.andM;Parker Systems claims that On the Money exceeds Solomon III's functionality,Great Plains's ease of installation and use, and the LAN efficiency ofPlatinum Series.andP;  The company is nothing if not ambitious.andM;LAN optimizaiton includes file- and record-locking techniques that minimizethe interval during which users need control of data records, avoiding LANgridlock through working smart.andM;On the Money isolates its comprehensive management reporting capabilitiesfrom its accounting functions.andP;  This makes real-time management informationavailable when needed, independent of accounting's closings, adjusting andfinalizing processes, Reports cross any module and calendar boundariestransparently.andP;  The Cash Expected report, for example, draws data fromsources such as cuff ent receivables, repeating invoices, blanket orders,current orders unshipped, and those shipped but not invoiced.andM;On the Money's practical style enables you to blend in your currentaccounting and business practices, then evolve die system as you use it.andP;  Forexample, you can incorporate existing forms layouts created in any wordprocessor.andP;  The manuals-often given short shrift by many vendors-relatedirectly to screen images, And a huge 21-character account code accommodatescomplex existing account structures.andP;  Compare that with Platinum'seight-character code.andM;Still a young system, On the Money lacks a broad dealer base, ale manyspecialized modules of the veteran packages, and the swarms of verticalvalue-added-reseller (VAR) products that surround today's leaders.andP;  Thoseleaders may profit from taking a peek in their rearview mirrors, though.andM;Besides On the Money, most of die other packages you might consider areupgrades of products reviewed in PC Magazine's September 15, 1987, accountingissue.andM;Armor Systems' Excalibur Plus Premier costs $3,475.andP;  The company offers eightother modules, and a $795 custom report generator was added this year.andP;  ArmorSystems stands alone in offering a 90-day money-back guarantee.andP;  Six months'unlimited phone support costs $125 per module.andM;Written in C with locked source code, Excalibur Plus targets those who valuecomprehensive feawres but who don't want to buy an expensive customizationcontract with the software.andP;  Great Plains Software espouses a similarphilosophy.andM;Cougar Mountain's Act II costs only $1,277.50 with Payroll thrown in, makingit the most economical multiuser package with true record and file locking.andO;Job Cost adds $599.50.andP;  Installation should still be done by a knowledgeableperson, but it shouldn't cost more than $1,000.andM;Act II was made for meat-and-potatoes LAN accounting.andP;  If you're squeezingthe dollars, you might see if this will do before going to die higher-pricedpackages.andM;CYMA Professional Accounting Series, Version 1.31, costs $3,875, with manyother modules available, CYMA offers a data migration path from severallower-end CYMA packages with similar interfaces.andP;  It's written in compiledCBASIC.andM;CYMA is coming back from a period of development inactivity.andP;  Our 1987 reviewpraised its completeness, speed, and flexibility but criticized the userinterface, which has now been revamped.andP;  For example, you can now use all the</TEXT></DOC>
