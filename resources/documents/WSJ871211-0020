The dollar fell 2.4% to 129 Japanese yen -- the lowest level since 1949 -- and 1.7% to 1.6325 West German marks in late New York trading. The dollar's post-1949 low against the mark came Nov. 30, when it was at 1.6315 marks.    In early Tokyo trading today, the dollar fell to 128.25 yen, from 128.75 yen at the opening. One hour into the morning session, selling slackened as an initial round of profit-taking buying hit the market.    To calm the panic rush out of dollars yesterday that immediately followed the news of the October trade deficit, half a dozen major central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, entered foreign exchange markets in an unusually visible manner to support the U.S. currency through official purchases.    Although yesterday's trade report came as a shock to the market, dealers said the news won't cause them to change their prognoses for the dollar's long-term health. Instead, dealers said the trade report simply reinforces their already pessimistic views. &quot;The market uniformly was predicting that 1988 would see a lower level for the dollar. This doesn't change that,&quot; said Ian M. Spence, chief dealer at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., New York.    In the short term, however, many market participants were expecting an upturn in the dollar over the next two weeks in response to corporate buying for year-end bookkeeping purposes. &quot;A lot of people were looking for a rebound in the dollar. Now, that's all been dashed,&quot; Charles A. Spence, vice president of foreign exchange at First Interstate Bank of California, Los Angeles, said.    When headlines reporting the $17.63 billion October trade deficit flashed on screens in trading rooms, the dollar plummeted instantly, with large gaps between bid and offered prices. The dollar, which stood at 1.6623 marks seconds before the announcement, fell 1.7% to 1.6335 marks five minute later -- a move that ordinarily would be startling for a week's period. On Wednesday, the dollar was at 1.6605 marks.    Waves of central bank intervention followed, propping the dollar up at slightly higher levels against the mark for most of the rest of the day. Meanwhile, a more serious rout out of dollars into yen ensued, despite some central bank efforts to resist the move.    Citing policy, the Federal Reserve wouldn't confirm its intervention activity yesterday. But several commercial bank dealers in New York said the Fed was buying dollars from them, and interpreted the Fed's buying pattern as intended to calm the sometimes disorderly trading.    The West German Bundesbank and the Bank of Italy, the central banks of two members of the Group of Seven industrialized nations, of which the U.S. is also a member, broke tradition to confirm their intervention in support of the dollar. In Rome, a spokesman for the Bank of Italy said the central bank intervened &quot;as part of a concerted action by the U.S. Federal Reserve and European central banks&quot; to support the dollar.    The Bank of England and the Bank of France, representing two other Group of Seven nations, also intervened to buy dollars, traders said, while the Swiss National Bank confirmed it purchased dollars as well.    The dollar's pummeling resulted in part from the total surprise of the size of the October deficit, which exceeded the September shortfall of $14.08 billion and the previous record of $16.47 billion in July. A figure of $16 billion was the highest forecast for the October deficit found in a Dow Jones andamp; Co. survey of 14 economists prior to the announcement. &quot;This number was completely unexpected,&quot; said Mr. Spence at Manufacturers Hanover.    Major market participants also had generally squared their positions in preparation for yesterday's report, traders said. So, absent from yesterday's trading was any of the dollar buying that usually follows releases of bad news as speculators cover short, or oversold, positions in the currency-exacerbating the dollar's fall. &quot;That's why the dollar went down as heavily as it did. People didn't have any short positions,&quot; said Keiichi Udagawa, the chief trader at Bank of Tokyo Ltd.'s New York branch.    Some dealers pointed to the expanded October trade deficit with Japan to explain why the dollar took a worse beating against the yen than against other major currencies. The trade gap widened by $1.2 billion to $5.86 billion with Japan. &quot;Almost a third of the deficit was with Japan,&quot; said Mr. Spence of First Interstate Bank.    Mr. Udagawa added that the dollar-yen rate was under particular pressure as Japanese exporters, caught with unhedged dollar exposures, charged in with the selling stampede. &quot;They thought the dollar would be held up by the Bank of Japan,&quot; Mr. Udagawa said, referring to the Japanese central bank's often lone intervention efforts in support of the U.S. currency. He said Japanese companies had also been deferring their usual selling in the past two weeks because of the dollar's relative stability against the yen.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery climbed $7.80 an ounce to $492.30 in brisk trading. The estimated volume was four million ounces.    ---                    LATE NEW YORK TRADING                   Thursday, Dec. 10, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
