Gen. Prosper Avril, and U.S.officials said loyal troops apparently rescued Avril as he wasbeing driven away to be deported.   Avril told the nation early Monday in a televised address thatrebel soldiers ``blinded by their exorbitant ambition'' attemptedto overthrow his government and appealed to Haitians to support hisleadership.   He did not provide details of attempted coup or say how it wasfoiled. There were no reports of casualties.   A government communique read earlier over state-run televisionsaid ``certain officers besieged'' the presidential palace ``andattempted to overthrow the government.''   Presidential guardsmen told journalists Avril was taken captiveat his mansion in Canape Verte, a wealthy neighborhood in the hillsoverlooking the capital, as he returned home from a party earlySunday.   Sources said four military officers had tried to overthrowAvril, who assumed power six months ago in this impoverishedCaribbean country's second coup in less than a year.   In his 10-minute speech, Avril said: ``At a time when thegovernment is doing its utmost to ensure democratic progress andeconomic recovery, once again the stability of the Haitian nationwas threatened.''   He was flanked by at least a dozen soldiers dressed in battlegear, including Sgt. Major Joseph Heubreux, who led the coup bynoncommissioned officers who put Avril in power last September.   ``On the night of April 1 and 2, some members of the armedforces blinded by their exorbitant ambitions attempted to overthrowthe government which I assumed Sept. 17 1988 as commander and chiefof the armed forces and president of the military government,''Avril said.   U.S. Embassy spokeswoman Susan Clyde said earlier that reportsindicated the coup attempt occurred about 4 a.m. and that Avril wasdetained for a time.   ``But it appears that when he was being taken to the airport tobe deported ... members of the presidential guard arrived at theairport and escorted him back to the palace to be presidentagain,'' she said in a telephone interview.   She said the attempted coup was ``totally bloodless.''   However, Radio Liberte quoted an unidentified soldier asPort-au-Prince would be ``set on fire'' unless the governmentreleased one of the alleged coup leaders, identified by the soldieras Lt. Col. Himmler Rebu, commander of the Leopards battalioncommando unit.   Military sources said Rebu was under military guard at theNational Palace.   Loyal soldiers told journalists that Avril's wife, Marie-Ange,and her mother were taken captive with Avril but released a couplehours later.   They also said two of Avril's brothers and Interior MinisterCol. Acedius St. Louis and his son were seized by the rebels.   Avril's son, brothers and St. Louis and his son reportedly werefreed after two tanks rolled into the Leopards' barracks andnegotiated their release Sunday night. There were no reports ofcasualties.   Initial reports had said the army commander, Maj. Gen. HerardAbraham, was among the coup leaders. But later accounts said thatwas not correct and that the plot collapsed when Abraham refusedthe rebels' offer of the presidency.   Abraham was foreign minister under the government of Lt. Gen.Henri Namphy, who Avril replaced.   The attempt came four days after the discharge of four top armyofficers accused of drug trafficking.   Unconfirmed reports said four army officers planned the coup,including Gen. Guy Francois, commander of the Dessalines barracksin Port-au-Prince, which is the base of the most feared unit inHaiti's 7,000-man army. The reports said all four officers had beendetained, but there was no confirmation.   In Washington, State Department spokesman Dennis Harter said thesituation in Haiti ``remains fluid.''   Haiti's international airport was closed and large numbers ofsoldiers were at the palace and on the streets, which were calm.   Gunfire was heard twice near the palace in the pre-dawn hours.Several hours later there was another spurt of gunfire in the samearea.   Five soldiers of the Presidential Guard arrived at independentradio station Liberte at 11:45 a.m. and read a statement denyingAvril was ousted.   ``There has not been any visible reaction from the people,'' Ms.Clyde said. ``The streets are very calm. People are going abouttheir business as usual.''   Richard Melton, U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state forCaribbean affairs, visited Haiti last Monday and told Avrilresumption of U.S. aid depended in part on Haiti's efforts to crackdown on the narcotics trade.   On Wednesday, four top army officers accunvolvement inthe drug trade were discharged.ay, a conservative political leader, said thosedismissals mighriggered the coup attempt.   Leslie Manigat, Haiti's last civ president, was elected inviolence-marred elections in January replaced a junta ledby Namphy that had governed since dictator Jean-Claude Duvalierfled to exile in France 9-year familydictatorship.   Namphy then overthrew Manigat in a coup June 20, 1988. On Sept.17, Avril came to power in a coup.   Two weeks ago, Avril partly restored constitutional rightssuspended in 1987. He also appointed a mostly civilian Cabinet andagreed to the establit of an electoral council to prepare forfree elections.   But there was widssatisfaction over the pace of hisreforms, and human rights groups accused the ofcontinuing repression.</TEXT></DOC>
