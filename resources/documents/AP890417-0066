The justices, without comment, left intact a 1986 federal lawprohibiting governors from withholding permission for such trainingmissions.   The law had been challenged by Massachusetts officials.   Today's action does not preclude the possibility that the issuecould some day return to the nation's highest court.   Since 1933, each person joining the National Guardsimultaneously enlists in two distinct organizations _ the Army orAir National Guard of a particular state and the Army or AirNational Guard of the United States.   The first organization serves as the state's militia; the secondas a reserve component of the national armed forces.   Congress in 1986 passed the so-called Montgomery Amendment afterseveral governors voiced opposition to the Reagan administration'sCentral American policy and said they would withhold their consentto National Guard training missions in that region.   The 1986 law prohibits any governor from withholding consent toa National Guard unit's active duty outside the country because ofan objection to the location, purpose or schedule of such duty.   A National Guard unit in Massachusetts was designated toparticipate in a Central America training mission in mid-1988, butGov. Michael Dukakis objected.   State officials sued the Department of Defense in federal court,alleging that the 1986 law is unconstitutional.   U.S. District Judge Robert E. Keeton upheld the law, and the 1stU.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed last Oct. 25.   The dispute centered on seemingly competing provisions in theConstitution.   One enpowers Congress ``to raise and support armies,'' including``calling forth the miltia.''   The other leaves to individual states the ``training of themilitia.''   Judge Keeton ruled that a state's authority to train NationalGuard members must yield to ``the legitimately exercised power ofCongress to raise and support armies.''   Keeton's ruling relied, in part, on a 1918 Supreme Courtdecision that upheld Congress' authority to draft members of astate militia into the national armed forces during World War I.   The judge discounted arguments by Massachusetts authorities thata state's authority to supervise the training of National Guardmembers is absolute during peacetime, and can be taken over by thefederal government only in times of national emergency.   A three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appealsdeclared the Montgomery Amendment unconstitutional after the lawwas challenged by Minnesota Gov. Rudy Perpich.   That ruling currently is under review by the entire 8th Circuitcourt.   Urging the justices to reject Massachusetts' appeal, Bushadministration lawyers said, ``It would be incongruous to hold thatthe Constitution gives Congress the power to establish thesereserves as components of the national armed forces but ...withholds (federal) authority ... to conduct their training.''   The administration lawyers added, ``Such a view would not onlyundercut the effectiveness of the national defense but would alsoinject the states into matters of foreign policy that theConstitution reserves to the federal government.''   As of 1986, Army National Guard members provided 46 percent ofthe Army's combat units and 28 percent of its support forces.   For fiscal year 1987, the Air National Guard members provided 73percent of the nation's air defense interceptor forces and 25percent of its tactical fighter forces.   The case is Massachusetts vs. Department of Defense, 88-1223.</TEXT></DOC>
