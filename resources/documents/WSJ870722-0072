Last year, the Internal Revenue Service audited only 0.47% of the individual income-tax returns filed in the Ocean State -- the lowest audit rate in the country. By contrast, the IRS examined 2.61% of returns in Nevada, where audit coverage was the highest.    As this disparity indicates, the IRS's audit efforts fall unevenly across the country. The differences were brought to light by the Research Institute of America, a New York company that sells tax information and publications, in an analysis comparing IRS figures on the number of returns audited in each state with the number filed.    Of course, the risk of being audited isn't very great anywhere: The overall rate for individual returns slipped to 1.1% last year from 2.3% in 1975. But figures compiled by The Wall Street Journal on audits conducted in 1986, which were concentrated on returns filed for the 1984 tax year, show that the chances of being audited in Nevada are more than five times higher than in Rhode Island.    Why the disparity? The agency tries to determine which returns are likely to produce revenue, and it audits more heavily in states with high percentages of such returns. &quot;We don't plan our audit rates by district,&quot; says Thomas Andretta, director of the IRS office of examination planning and research. &quot;But it turns out that some districts have more possibly noncompliant taxpayers than others.&quot;    Generally, individual returns are selected for audit based on formulas that are known to no more than a dozen employees and kept in a safe in the agency. Computers flag returns that have triggered statistical alarms for each income level based on the amount of deductions, use of tax shelters, types of income or other factors. Officials refuse to disclose the elements of the screening formula or what makes a return get a high score.    In recent years, though, the IRS has publicized campaigns to give close attention to partners and promoters of tax shelters, people who earn tip income, and the self-employed, among others. Mr. Andretta says that Nevada may be heavily audited because the gambling industry produces a lot of tip income, which is difficult to trace without an audit.    Roscoe Egger, who was IRS commissioner from 1981 to 1986 and is now a partner at the accounting firm of Price Waterhouse, says Nevada's high audit rate may stem from the state's high percentage of upper-income taxpayers. &quot;Returns showing over $50,000 (in income) get more attention than those with under $10,000,&quot; he says, adding that &quot;gambling by itself wouldn't make a difference.&quot;    The relatively high audit rates in such places as Texas and Oklahoma may reflect the fact that they are heavy oil and gas drilling states. &quot;There may be a feeling that that's an area that leads to sheltering of income,&quot; suggests Donald Korb, a partner in the Cleveland law firm of Thompson, Hine andamp; Flory who was an assistant to Mr. Egger. &quot;There could be a perception that those are returns that may need a little more attention.&quot;    Mr. Korb says that taxpayers also have tended to be less bashful about claiming tax deductions and credits in New York City and California, which could explain the high percentage of audits in those places. &quot;In California and New York, taxpayers are a little more aggressive than perhaps in the Midwest,&quot; he says. While New York state ranks 20th on the list, Manhattan alone, with an audit rate of 1.53%, would rank right behind Texas, which has the seventh-highest audit rate.    David J. Silverman, a New York tax consultant, says California taxpayers may be heavily audited because they include a high percentage of self-employed people. &quot;In Silicon Valley, everybody's a consultant,&quot; he says. &quot;Who knows if they file tax returns?&quot; He adds that the IRS recently has been more interested in whether taxpayers are reporting all of their income than in whether they can support their deductions.    Another factor that tends to lead to audits is a region's rate of population change. &quot;A region with people moving in and out tends to be less stable, with less voluntary compliance,&quot; says Mr. Andretta. California and many Sun Belt states could fall into this category.    In some cases, a region's audit rate depends less on how lawful or wealthy its citizens are than on how densely populated it is. Mr. Andretta explains that the IRS has at least one district office in each state, and as a result auditors in sparsely populated states like Alaska and Wyoming have relatively fewer returns to handle and can audit a higher percentage.    A local IRS office also can initiate projects, aimed at specific tax fraud or evasion, that would inflate its district's audit rate. Several years ago, the IRS had to put extra resources into auditing certain areas to combat a tax-protester movement that encouraged employees to avoid taxes by claiming excessive exemptions on withholding forms.    Variations in IRS presence occasionally have riled lawmakers who felt the tax collecters were persecuting their districts. Donald Alexander, a partner at the law firm Cadwalader, Wickersham andamp; Taft in Washington who was IRS commissioner from 1973 to 1977, says, &quot;I got lots of flack from certain members of Congress, from the press, and I got it from Nevada, of course. People thought they were being picked on.&quot;    Tax experts generally contend that the examination rate is too low, saying would-be tax cheats are encouraged by knowing that they're unlikely to be audited. &quot;The audit program has been a disaster in its very limited coverage,&quot; says Mortimer Caplin, a former IRS commissioner now with the Washington law firm of Caplin andamp; Drysdale. &quot;People are playing the audit lottery in the expectation of not being examined.&quot;    The IRS's workload grew faster than its budget for years, but now the agency is increasing the funds and staff assigned to audits. It says it plans to examine 1.23% of all individual returns in 1987 and 1.32% in 1988. The agency also has increased funds for its document-matching program, in which computers match income reports against returns so as to catch discrepancies without a full audit.    ---                   The Chances of an Audit    Percentage of individual returns examined in 1986 fromeach state, as compiled from IRS figures.
