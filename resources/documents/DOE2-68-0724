<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-68-0724 </DOCNO><TEXT>Superconductors are materials which combine the property of zero electricalresistance with the capability to exclude any adjacent magnetic field.One consequence of this latter effect is that a magnet repels a superconductoras if it were another magnet with opposite polarity. This leads to manylarge scale applications such as the highly publicized levitating trains,generation of magnetic fields in MHD (Magnetic Hydrodynamic) electricgenerators, medical diagnostic equipment such as SQUID (SuperconductingQuantum Interference Device), etc. On a smaller scale, the applicationof superconductivity materials into computers could replace the existingresistive connectors and decrease signal delays by reducing all RLC timeconstants. Thus, a computer could operate at much higher speeds, andconsequently, at lower power dissipation levels which would reduce theneed for heat removal. These applications have been put into practice,or hypothesized, due to the recent breakthroughs in superconductivityresearch. Although technical advances and proposed applications are constantlybeing published, it should be recognized that superconductivity is aslowly developing technology. It has taken scientists almost eighty yearsto learn what they now know about this material and its function.</TEXT></DOC>
