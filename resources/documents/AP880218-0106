Igor Khripounov, first secretary at the Soviet Embassy,Alecsandr Zobkov, an assistant military attache, and VladimirSadovnikov, director of the Soviet city of Votkinsk's IndustrialOrganization, arrived Wednesday and planned to leave Friday, saidCarey Cavanaugh, a representative from the State Department'soffice of Soviet Union Affairs.   The delegation is here ``just to get a general feel of the SaltLake area,'' Cavanaugh said.   The delegates toured the Mormon Church's Temple Square indowntown Salt Lake City on Wednesday and planned to visit mountaincanyons today.   A three-member American delegation is in Votkinsk, about 600miles east of Moscow in the Ural Mountains, for a simultaneousvisit.   ``Both areas were identified on the Intermediate Nuclear Forcestreaty as areas where monitoring for the inspection of INF sitescould take place,'' Cavanaugh said.   Both cities had previously been closed to diplomats from eithercountry.   ``This is a very important treaty,'' Khripounov said when hearrived at Salt Lake International Airport. ``We hope to lookaround and see how people live. We'd like to see the cultural side_ perhaps the world famous (Mormon Tabernacle) choir.''   The delegation also planned to visit Magna, a suburb of 8,500west of Salt Lake City and site of the Hercules Inc. Bacchus Westplant. The facility developed motors for the Pershing II missiles,banned under the treaty, from 1979 to 1987.   Up to 30 Soviet inspectors may establish a compound near theplant if the Senate ratifies the INF treaty, signed Dec. 7 byPresident Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.</TEXT></DOC>
