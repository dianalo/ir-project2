He stressed that he is willing to testify voluntarily later.   ``One would think that common courtesy and basic fairness demandthat the subcommittee grant to any citizen ... sufficient time toconsult counsel and prepare testimony,'' said Pierce.   Rep. Thomas Lantos, the subcommittee chairman, characterizedPierce's dramatic decision not to appear as ``deceitful, misleading,and a betrayal of the good faith with which this subcommittee hasdealt with him.''   Lantos said that if Pierce did not appear Friday he would ask thepanel to issue a subpoena forcing him to appear. Procedural ruleswould prevent such a vote until next week, and Pierce's lawyer saidhe hoped Lantos would reconsider and simply agree to reschedulePierce's appearance.   But a Republican member of the subcommittee, Rep. ChristopherShays of Connecticut, said the decision ``tells me he's gotsomething to hide. If he doesn't show up we are going to subpoenaMr. Pierce for a series of hearings. We obviously can't trust him.''   Pierce has emerged as the central figure in the subcommittee'sinvestigation of mismanagement and influence peddling at HUD duringthe Reagan administration.   The former secretary informed the panel last week that he had hadtrouble retaining legal counsel and requested a two-week delay inhis appearance. But Lantos, who had previously agreed to push backPierce's testimony by a month, denied the request.   ``I initially delayed obtaining counsel because I believed theinvestigation was being conducted in a non-adversarial manner thatdid not require counsel,'' Pierce said in his statement. ``After itbecame apparent that this situation had changed, I undertookexhaustive efforts to local experienced counsel.''   Pierce last week settled on Washington attorney Paul Perito, whosaid in an interview Thursday that he and his colleagues have nothad enough time to weed through boxes of documents that Pierce wouldneed to review.   ``I did not think I could be a responsible lawyer if in fact wewent forward (Friday),'' Perito said.   The subcommittee is eager to question Pierce about a number ofcontroversial decisions he made, including his lifting restrictionson a lender after he was lobbied by former Secretary Carla Hills andhis overruling career experts in favor of financing a project backedby a former law partner.   Several members, including Lantos, have said they want toquestion Pierce about contradictions in his testimony to the panelin May and the accounts of other former HUD officials.   Perito, in a letter to Lantos informing him of Pierce's decision,said:   ``In order for Mr. Pierce to be completely prepared, the fullrecord must be reviewed. ... Regrettably, the subcommittee's refusalto allow him an additional two weeks ... forced us to concludereluctantly that continued voluntary cooperation does not afford himadequate procedural safeguards and guarantees of fairness. For thisreason, among others, he has authorized me to inform you that hewill not voluntarily appear.''   Perito said the subcommittee has not informed Pierce whatportions of his May testimony are considered to be inconsistent.   ``This is of particular concern where, as here, there appears tobe no separate legislative purpose for inquiring about`inconsistencies' other than to invite potential charges ofperjury.''   A few hours before Pierce refused to appear, Lantos said he hopedthe former secretary would use his testimony to accept blame forsome of the agency's problems.   ``He has not yet said `mea culpa, mea maxima culpa, I have madehorrible mistakes,''' Lantos said.   ``Obviously we have sworn testimony that contradicts SecretaryPierce's sworn testimony,'' Lantos said.   Friday's hearing was to focus on Pierce's decisions to back theNorth Carolina project supported by a former law partner and thelifting of restrictions on the DRG Funding Corp. after being lobbiedby Mrs. Hills, now the Bush administration trade representative.   Pierce had said he was not a ``hands-on'' manager and took nodirect role in funding decisions.   A former deputy, however, later told Congress that Piercepersonally ordered her to approve a $15 million Durham, N.C.,housing project that was opposed by several career officials.   Pierce, in a Time magazine interview published this week,acknowledged overruling staff and ordering the project forward. Itwas supported by Charles Markham, then mayor of Durham who practicedlaw with Pierce in the 1960s.   DRG, the biggest lender under a departmental co-insuranceprogram, has a HUD loan portfolio that includes more than $538million in defaults. Mrs. Hills met with Pierce after her lobbyingof other officials failed, and he agreed to lift restrictions thatrequired DRG to get departmental approval before making any loans.</TEXT></DOC>
