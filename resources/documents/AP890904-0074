(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Air Force's last Titan 3 rocketblasted off with a secret military satellite Monday, ending aquarter century of launches by a workhorse booster that has hurledmore than 200 satellites into space.   The 16-story-tall rocket, the powerful 34D model, brilliantlyilluminated the darkness as it blazed away from its launch pad at1:54 a.m.   The Air Force said it was the 135th success in 141 launches forthe Titan 3 family, a success rate of 96 percent.   ``We close the book of the Titan 34D and move on to anothergeneration of launch vehicles,'' said Brig. Gen. Thomas W.Honeywill, commander of the Air Force Systems Command.   Officials said Monday's payload was secret. Sources who spoke oncondition on anonymity said the rocket may have carried areconnaissance satellite.   Many of the satellites carried by Titan 3 rockets have beencloaked in secrecy since the first was launched here in 1964.   The payloads, most of them built for the Pentagon, have performeda number of strategic assignments, including photo reconnaissance,communications, navigation, monitoring missile tests, interceptingmilitary and diplomatic messages, verifying Soviet compliance witharms treaties and establishing an orbiting system to provide instantalert of a missile attack.   Titan 3 rockets also launched two Viking spacecraft toward Marsin 1976 and sent the Voyager 1 and 2 probes in 1977 toward the solarsystem's outer reaches.   Voyager 2 two weeks ago week sent back stunning images of Neptuneand its moon Triton as it completed a grand tour that also includeda closeup look at Uranus.   The Titan 34D can boost 31,650-pound payloads into low orbit,about 150 miles up, or 4,200 pounds to stationary orbit 22,300 milesout.   The Air Force is replacing it with the larger Titan 4, the firstof which boosted a missile warning satellite into orbit on June 14.The new rocket can hoist 39,000 pounds to low orbit or 10,000 poundsto stationary orbit.   Martin Marietta Space Launch Systems has a contract to build 23Titan 4s for the Air Force for $5.1 billion and is negotiating foran additional 26 rockets.   Martin Marietta developed the Titan 3 series for the Air Forcefrom the Titan 2 intercontinental range nuclear missile, whichearlier had been modified to boost into orbit the two-man Geminicapsule in the mid-1960s.   The booster evolved through the Titan 3A, 3B, 3C and 34D series,each more powerful than the last.   ``With this launch, the Titan continued its unparalleled successrecord,'' said Gareth D. Flora, president of Space Launch Systems.   ``Titan expendable launch vehicles have been the backbone of theAir Force's space program for more than 20 years, and we expect theTitan 4 to continue that tradition.''</TEXT></DOC>
