The data base was created to store, organize, and retrieve selectedfeatures of the nuclear and process signal noise data because the largevolume of data collected by the automated system makes manual data handlingand interpretation based on visual examination of noise signatures impractical.Information is extracted from files created by the data acquisition systemand written in a data base input file. A data loading program reads theinput file and automatically stores the data in the data base. The database contains information extracted from approximately 8000 spectra collectedover nine fuel cycles. The FFTF noise data base contains significantfeatures extracted from the noise spectra as well as information describingboth the reactor state and signal conditioning during each measurement.The features extracted are the amplitude and frequency of peaks and thesquare of the root-mean-square calculated for 24 frequency intervals.The dc values of the reactor signals measured at the beginning and endof each measurement give the reactor state during each measurement. Thiswork demonstrates how commercially available data base software can beapplied to efficiently manage the large volume of data collected by anautomated system. Automated data collection, information extraction,and data storage and manipulation eliminate the most tedious aspectsof noise analysis and, compared to manual data handling, allow inferencesand conclusions to be based on a much larger collection of data. Thedata base system for noise data management allows the automatically collecteddata to be effectively utilized, resulting in a more efficient and effectivemonitoring system. 5 refs., 6 figs., 5 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
