The Treasury's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms is stillreviewing the uses of all types of semiautomatics that are imported,but has not reached a decision on whether to suspend importation ofmore models than the five types banned from import this week, saidJerry Rudden, spokesman for the BATF.   ``The process is ongoing. Additional firearms may very well beadded to the list ... Large numbers of firearms are being lookedat,'' he said.   But he said a report that the BATF had added some weapons to thelist and then changed its mind was erroneous.   White House spokeswoman Alixe Glen had said earlier that sheunderstood such a decision had been made by BATF but that it wasdone ``without any pressure or direction from any other agency,''including the White House and the Treasury Department hierarchy.   Chief of Staff John Sununu's office also heard that BATF mightadd more weapons to its suspension, said a Sununu aide who spoke oncondition of anonymity. The aide said he called BATF officials tolearn if that was true and was told that the bureau was stillevaluating the matter and had no announcement planned on expandingthe ban.   The aide said he was only seeking information and the call didnot indicate any White House pressure, although the lobbyist for theNational Rifle Association, Wayne LaPierre, met with Sununu Thursdaywhile Bush was traveling in Texas and Colorado.   The meeting lasted less than 10 minutes, Sununu's aide said, anddid not involve discussion of a potential expanded suspension.LaPierre brought a copy of the NRA's public comment on thesuspension, and discussed some concerns about legislation inCongress.   NRA officials refused comment today on any of their contacts withthe administration.   The Washington Post reported today that BATF had intended onThursday to announce it would supplement an import ban announced twodays earlier on such weapons as the Uzi and AK-47.   The newspaper said the Treasury Department squelched the planunder pressure from NRA officials.   The NRA has reacted publicly with caution on the administration'ssuspension of some imports. It did not directly criticize the move.   An administration source said the White House has received manycalls from gun-control opponents who are worried about the precedentthe action could set with regard to domestically produced weapons.   ``It's arguably the hottest issue out there,'' the official said,speaking on condition of anonymity.   Vice President Dan Quayle said the day after the ban wasannounced Tuesday that he had received several calls in that vein.   The ban covered five types that accounted for 80 percent of thesemiautomatic imports, officials said.   William J. Bennett, the administration's director of drug controlpolicy, called for the temporary ban because of the popularity ofthe weapons, with their rapid-fire ability and large-capacityammunition clips, with drug dealers.   An AK-47 was used by a mentally unbalanced drifter to kill fivechildren in a Stockton, Calif., schoolyard.</TEXT></DOC>
