Gigot </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><G> CNG </G><TEXT>   &quot;The first thing I have to say,&quot; said Sen. Bob Packwood, &quot;is real men don't get arrested by Brock Adams.&quot;    Thus did the Oregon Republican begin explaining on Wednesday, to a crowd of highly amused reporters, how it was that his Democratic colleague Sen. Adams had signed a warrant for his arrest in the wee hours of that morning, then dispatched the sergeant-at-arms to find and carry him feet-first onto the Senate floor.    The Democrats were trying to find a quorum to break a Republican filibuster. Idaho's Steve Symms, who earlier had joked to Mr. Packwood that &quot;I'll take out the first one with my M-1 as he comes through the door,&quot; resembled Carl Lewis more than Rambo as he fled down the hallway.    Sen. Lowell Weicker of Connecticut glowered, which is what he does best, and the arresting officers decided to look elsewhere. Mr. Packwood, his arm in a cast from a fall two weeks ago, became the most vulnerable target after his office hiding place was betrayed by a cleaning woman.    Both Mr. Packwood's sense of humor and the GOP filibuster survived the Keystone Cop choreography, but what might not survive is any reputation the Senate has left for seriousness. &quot;I mean, it's not as if all of this is over something important to the nation, like civil rights&quot; or the budget, said Sen. Alan Simpson, the assistant Republican leader. No, the Senate has been tying itself into a procedural pretzel over the gripping issue of &quot;campaign reform.&quot;    Now, campaign reform is best understood as a Washington oxymoron, like &quot;government ethics&quot; or &quot;public-interest lobby.&quot; It is the kind of issue politicians like to talk about because it allows them to sound upright by deploring the things they have to do for a living, such as raising money. Moralizing is its soul.    Majority Leader Robert Byrd says that Senate campaign spending limits are urgently needed because, egad, voters &quot;perceive us all as being beholden to the special-interest groups that make contributions to our election and reelection.&quot; Sen. James Exon (D., Neb.) avows that reform is essential to preserve &quot;the ongoing sanctity of our elective process.&quot;    The issue is actually less about sanctity than sanctimony. An irony of the last great campaign &quot;reform,&quot; during the Watergate era, is that Republicans have done far better at fund-raising than Democrats. The $1,000 limit on personal contributions limited the clout of rich liberals, while letting the GOP exploit its more numerous business supporters.    Republicans can usually outraise and outspend Democrats, who therefore want limits on spending. &quot;This is a sour grapes bill,&quot; argues Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.), the GOP's point man on the issue, speaking from across the cot installed in his office to let him nap between round-the-clock quorum calls.    It's also an incumbent-protection bill for members of either party. Sen. McConnell's figures show that in the 1986 Senate campaign, 18 of the 20 challengers who spent within the limits of the proposed reform bill lost. But all 10 of the incumbents who spent within the limits won. On the other hand, five of the eight challengers who spent above the limits also won. Heavy spending by challengers, especially for TV ads, helps to offset the higher name recognition, postal subsidies, routine news coverage and many other benefits that incumbents naturally have.    Nor does the bill do much at all about contributions from political-action committees, which reformers also routinely deplore. The Byrd-Boren reform bill keeps the contribution limit at $5,000 per PAC per election, and a cynic might conclude that's because PACs naturally favor incumbents (who have power) over challengers (who don't).    Indeed, according to Federal Election Commission figures, the five senators who received the most PAC money in 1987 were all Democrats. Sen. Byrd, the moralist/reformer, was third with $663,000 from PACs.    In total last year, 15 Senate Democrats raised nearly $8 million from PACs, while 12 GOP incumbents raised $4.4 million. The disparity is similar among incumbents in the House, where Democrats have an even larger majority, and where only six challengers beat incumbents in 1986, a new low.    Not surprisingly, many Republicans believe the best campaign reform would be to reduce the amount PACs can give, though Sen. Simpson says that when &quot;I bring that up, they shriek and leave the building.&quot;    Which brings us back to what Mr. McConnell calls &quot;the Packwood caper.&quot; If Mr. Byrd and his majority had any hope of passing the bill with spending limits, it promptly vanished with Wednesday morning's arrest, the first such episode in more than 40 years. The Democrats had already lost seven votes to break the filibuster last year, and they're expected to lose an eighth this morning.    If the senators are still set on passing something they can call &quot;campaign reform,&quot; of course, they could always vote, say, to limit the number of terms senators can serve. &quot;If there's one thing I could change about the Congress, that would be it,&quot; says Sen. Bill Armstrong (R., Colo.), though that is about as likely as a vote for a Senate pay cut.    As it happens, Mr. Armstrong also offered the best perspective on the significance of this week's Senate mayhem. On Tuesday, he said on the Senate floor that he'd certainly be willing to work all night if he had to, but, really, he'd much rather go home and watch &quot;Noble House&quot; on television. </TEXT></DOC>
