(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Fractional T1 Makes WAN ViableandM;With the expansion of fractional T1 service, upgrading an existing networkbuilt around analog leased lines has become easier to cost-justify.andP;  In fact,cost avoidance may be all that's required for justification.andM;After Holyoke andamp; Schmuker Ltd.--our fictitious maker of customwidgets--successfully finished its acquisition of workstation (see &quot;DRStrategies Model,&quot; Digital Review, Sept. 18, page 44), our intrepid MISdirector is faced with a change in the corporation's strategic plan.andM;Manufacturing widgets is very raw-resource intensive.andP;  To reducetransportation costs, the manufacturing plant was built on the azure shoresof one of the lesser great lakes, 500 miles away from headquarters.andP;  Sinceall engineering had been done at the corporate headquarters, the datacommunications need with the plant consisted of a minimal amount of dailyreporting.andM;To satisfy those needs, a D2 conditioned analog line was leased and a pair ofhigh-speed modems was employed.andP;   Statistical multiplexers were used toserially connect six terminals and a 300-line-per-minute band printer toHolyoke andamp; Schmuker's VAXcluster.andP;  The cost of the leased line is $567 permonth and maintenance on the equipment is $170 a month.andM;Following the successful introduction of the high-tech widgets, theengineerng division was pressured to deliver engineering change orders tomanufacturing more quickly.andP;  The group can no longer afford the time delay insending blueprints to the plant by overnight mail.andP;  As a result, engineeringdecides to move part of the widget design team out of corporate headquartersand into the Holyoke andamp; Schmuker manufacturing plant.andM;To support the design efforts that will be located in the plant, the vicepresident of engineering wants to move five of Holyoke andamp; Schmuker'sRISC-based workstations along with the design squad.andP;  This move will enablethe final design plans and engineering change orders to be worked on at theplant, making them instantly available to manufacturing.andM;In response to the new strategic plan, Holyoke andamp; Schmuker's MIS directorproposes that the workstations be placed on a LAN in the plant.andP;  Two remotebridges--one at each end--will then be used to tie the plant's LAN to the LANat corporate headquarters.andP;  Also, the WAN's backbone will be a 56Kbps digitalline.andP;  This higher bandwidth is needed to support the increasein networktraffic.andM;Depreciable hardware for the new LAN installation will include a Delniadaptor, a terminal server, two remote bridges and two digital phone-lineinterface units.andP;  The budget for this hardware is $20,800.andP;  And fortunatelyfor holyoke andamp; Schmuker, fractional T1 service already exists betweencorporate headquarters and the plant.andP;  The new 56Kbps digital leased line isbudgeted at $782 a month.andP;  installation for both the phone line and theLAN--including Ethernet cable and taps--is budgeted at $4,000.andP;  After thewarranty period, maintenance for the new equipment is budgeted at $170 permonth and is expected to inflate by 3 percent annually.andM;The MIS director finds that he can easily justify the added costs of buildingthe new WAN on a cost-avoidance basis.andP;  By utilizing NFS and DECnet over theWAN, the designers at the plant will be able to access CAD files stored onthe corporate VAXcluster and make only a local copy of the file they areworking on.andP;  This will help to avoid costly errors that come withversion-control problems.andP;  But more important, this will put off the need topurchase a 600MB disk for each of the four workstations.andM;Not buying the disks presents an immediate savings of $21,000.andP;  In addition,there are long-term savings that derive from reduced maintenance charges whencompared to the existing communications equipment.andP;  Also, by not buying thedisks, those maintenance dollars are saved.andP;  These savings are estimated tobe $570 per month.andM;Modeling these costs over five years, holyoke andamp; Schmuker's MIS directordevelops a very impressive bottom line proposal.andP;  Payback for the new WANwill come in 22 months.andP;  Even when discounted at 15 percent annually, thecash flow from simple cost avoidance amounts to $5,134 and the internal rateof return on the project is an impressive 30.7 percent.andM;For holyoke andamp; Schmuker Ltd., the WAN upgrade clearly pays for itself.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
