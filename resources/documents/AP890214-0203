Merc officials predicted Monday that the effectiveness of theirown enforcement efforts will be confirmed by a federal inquiry intoallegations that as many as 100 traders and brokers at the exchangeand the Chicago Board of Trade systematically cheated customers outof millions of dollars in profits.   But the Merc also noted in a statement that the undercover probewould uncover violations that have escaped its best efforts becauseFBI agents can use ``electronic surveillance techniques that wouldhave constituted felonies if employed by the CME and its staff.''   As part of the investigation, FBI agents posed as traders tolearn whether other traders were manipulating the trading ofcontracts for future deliveries of commodities ranging from soybeansto Treasury bonds.   U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas, whose office reportedly isconducting the undercover effort, has refused to confirm even thatan investigation is ongoing. No indictments have been issued.   In a related matter, CME officials on Monday also criticized newscoverage of the investigation, and police detectives said they hadnot established a motive for the apparent suicide of a veterantrader and former policeman.   The Merc's Board of Governors said in a statement that thedisclosure of the probe on Jan. 19 had sparked a ``media frenzy''that had inflicted possibly irreversible damage on the futuresindustry.   On Monday, retired policeman Edward Cashman, 69, was found shotto death in the furnace room of his Northwest Side home, an apparentsuicide, said Police Sgt. Russell Weingart.   Weingart said detectives interviewed members of the family andthe prominent, family-owned Victor Grain Co. to determine whetherCashman's death was tied to the ongoing federal investigation.   ``But we haven't established any motive so far,'' said Weingart.</TEXT></DOC>
