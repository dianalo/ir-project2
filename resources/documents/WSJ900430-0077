International Business Machines Corp., Apple Computer Inc.and other big computer makers are staking out positions inthe nascent market for &quot;note-pad computers,&quot; small machinesthat let users enter data by writing rather than tappingkeys. The note pads typically recognize numbers and lettersprinted on a screen with a special pen and convert them intoconventional electronic characters. The information is thenstored for later transfer to a personal computer or acompany's main computers.</LP><TEXT>   The size of the market for note-pad computers isn't clear,but Infocorp, a Santa Clara, Calif., market-research firm,estimates the market will grow to 3.4 million units sold in1995 from 22,000 units this year. Only one company, TandyCorp.'s Grid Systems unit, currently sells note-pad computersin the U.S.; its model, introduced last September, is pricedat $3,000. But new ventures are expected to introduce severalnote-pad machines this year. And already, big computer makersare fighting quietly for control over software standards forthese gadgets, which require different programs from thoseused with keyboard computers.   &quot;This is a group of people fundamentally worried abouttheir future,&quot; says Stewart Alsop, editor of PC Letter. &quot;Noone wants to be left behind.&quot;   The early wrangling pits IBM, the world's largest computermaker, against Microsoft Corp., the biggest supplier ofsoftware for personal computers. In the 1980s, the twocompanies teamed up to set a software standard for personalcomputers called MS-DOS. Today, however, they appear to beapproaching note-pad computers on different paths.   Microsoft is determined to stay within the MS-DOS standardfor note-pad software. Though the company may be willing towrite applications for other standards, &quot;I don't believe youhave to come up with a new operating system to succeed inthis business,&quot; says Jeff Raikes, who runs Microsoft'sword-processing division.   But in an apparent effort to set a different standard, IBMhas struck an alliance with Go Corp., a tiny Foster City,Calif., company. Go is expected to introduce later this yeara note-pad computer incompatible with MS-DOS, the basicsoftware needed for most personal computers, including IBM's.People close to the deal say IBM has agreed to license Go'ssoftware for use in future note-pad computers of its own.   The standards battle is hard to handicap. Go has persuadedsome large software makers, including Borland InternationalInc., to write applications that work with its operatingsoftware. But Grid Systems chose Microsoft's MS-DOS for itsnote-pad computer, and Software Publishing Corp. turned downa request to produce programs for Go &quot;because the last thingwe need is another operating system,&quot; says Fred Gibbons,Software Publishing's chief executive officer.   U.S. companies tackle software issues in earnest becausesoftware is an area where they hold an advantage overJapanese competitors. Japanese companies, however, figure tosupply much of the basic hardware -- the displays, the screencoating on which people write and the circuitry -- fornote-pad computers.   The new gadgets should help broaden acceptance of personalcomputers in Japan, where the country's elaborate writtenlanguage has frustrated typists and forced many to maintainhandwritten records. In March, Sony became the first companyin Japan to sell a note pad that recognizes Japanesecharacters.   Despite intense interest, note-pad computers aren't a surething. They could become &quot;an exotic flop&quot; because ofrestrictions on handwriting that may disappoint buyersexpecting the devices to recognize script or messy printing,says Peter Teige, an analyst at Infocorp, the market-researchfirm. For instance, Grid's note pad can only accuratelyrecognize clearly printed letters and numbers. That meansmany users may have to modify their ordinary handwriting whenusing the pad.   Such limitations are expected on a note pad from Go,expected to be introduced later this year, and industryofficials expect subsequent models from other U.S.manufacturers to require careful printing as well. &quot;We won'tsee cursive writing for anywhere from three to 15 years,&quot;says Vern Raburn, who last year founded Slate Corp., aScottsdale, Ariz., company that plans to produce software forGo's computer.   For at least the next few years, note pads will functionmost readily by contrasting clearly printed letters against&quot;static&quot; images of letters stored in memory. An alternative&quot;dynamic&quot; approach recognizes curves and connections betweenletters, but because English writers exhibit idiosyncraticstyles, producing highly accurate systems is hard. Japanesemakers are using this more complex approach, but mainlybecause Japanese people are more consistent in theirpenmanship.   Besides technical concerns, there are serious questionsabout whether the size of the market for note-pad computersjustifies all the effort. &quot;It's an open question how muchsomeone is willing to modify their normal practice to use&quot; anote-pad computer, says Michael Swavely, president of CompaqComputer Corp.'s North American operations. &quot;Unfortunately,the {computer} industry has a long history of promising morethan it can actually deliver. I think we're in that mode withhandwriting recognition.&quot;   Boosters of the devices, though, say that for a vastnumber of workers, a note pad rather than a laptop computerbetter suits their routine. Moreover, they say most peoplefind writing with a pen more natural than typing on akeyboard.   At the very least, these gadgets should win a followingamong mobile workers who now keep track of business on formsattached to clipboards. To improve the accuracy of itsrecords, Best Foods Baking Group, a unit of CPC InternationalInc., is starting to outfit its 1,500 delivery-truck driverswith Grid Systems computers. The note-pad computers replace asystem of keeping records on paper forms.   Besides Best Foods, Grid has obtained large orders for itsnote pad from Southern Pacific Transportation Co. and severalother companies. &quot;This is a blue-collar computer, a computerfor truck drivers,&quot; says Alan Lefkof, Grid's president.   Handwriting aside, pens seem destined to leave their markon personal computers. Future models are likely to sport apen controlling some of the machine's functions; pointing atspots on the screen will trigger operations much as clickinga button on a mouse, or pointing device, works today.   Says Jean-Louis Gassee, Apple's chief of productdevelopment: &quot;The question isn't keyboards vs. pens,&quot; but howthey can complement each other.</TEXT></DOC>
