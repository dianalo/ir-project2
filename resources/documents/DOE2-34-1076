This study (Phase1 of a two-phase project) sought to: show that an R6-R-10 window couldbe built and be compatible with commercially available materials andtechnologies; verify predicted thermal performance values with lab andfield testing; improve on existing production technologies for greaterefficiency and lower cost; ascertain the structural integrity of suchwindows; develop first- generation prototypes; and evaluate cost-effectiveness.21 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
