As slaves of sleep, we have dreams that contain multiple mysteries,great emotion, impossible events, inspiration, psychic phenomena and,occasionally, sweat-forming horror.;    Such uninhibited imagination isfertile ground for the movies.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Weekend  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  THE DREAMS THAT FILMS ARE MADE OFA HANDFUL OF MOVIES, INCLUDING THE LATESTFROM KUROSAWA, RELY ON FANTASY FOR PLOT  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  VideoApel, Mercury News video columnist, is host of KTEH-TV's science-fictionprograms on Sunday nights.  </MEMO><TEXT>     Different films have taken a variety of approaches to this netherworld overthe years, often mirroring popular opinion of the time. In many older classics-- such as &quot;The Wizard of Oz,&quot; &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; and &quot;A Connecticut Yankeein King Arthur's Court&quot; -- the totality of the action is dismissed as &quot;only adream.&quot;;    Other films use dream sequences as just another cinematictechnique, like daydreams or flashbacks, to give the characters an extra bitof real or imagined psychological depth. And in one film, the science-fictionclassic &quot;Forbidden Planet,&quot; dreams become manifest and wreak havoc on theobjects of the dreamer's hatred.;    There is a handful of movies, however, inwhich the dream is the central focus of the film. Those below count among thisselect few, and each one is a modern classic.;     (box) &quot;Dead of Night&quot;(1945; HBO). This British horror anthology revolves around an extraordinarygroup of people whose dreams have a nasty habit of coming true. In onesegment, a man haunted by a murder awakens only to find himself at thebeginning of the plot again, trapped in an endless loop of the tragic action.And in the capstone piece, Michael Redgrave brilliantly portrays aventriloquist at war with his dummy -- and losing.;     (box) &quot;Night Terror&quot;(1990; Magnum; unrated). This recent made-for-video feature (produced anddirected by local film makers Michael Weaver and David C. Lee) is anotherhorror anthology but with the twist of telepathy rather than precognition. Init, an unbalanced man with the ability to tune in to other peoples' dreamswanders the corridors of a sleep-disorder clinic falling victim to thenightmares of the other patients.;     (box) &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot;(1984; MHE; rated R). This first film in this popular horror series came upwith yet another new twist on the old night terrors: a villain who actuallyexists in the shadowland of the unconscious and can enter the material worldthrough the portal of his victims' dreams. In this entry, a tough, determinedteen-ager wages war on Freddy Krueger by luring him from his world to her hometurf. Bloody and occasionally nerve-wracking -- the film has a touch of humorto redeem it.;     (box) &quot;Dreamscape&quot; (1984; HBO; PG-13). Weren't any filmsmade about good dreams?;    Even in this superior adventure entry, thehumanitarian plan of injecting trained psychics into other people's nightmaresto end the threats becomes twisted by evil minds into a new method of murder.;   One benefit of watching this film is the quick tutorial it offers in thefrontiers of real-life dream research, specifically Dr. Stephen LaBerge'spioneering work at Stanford, as detailed in his book &quot;Lucid Dreaming.&quot;;    (box) &quot;Akira Kurosawa's Dreams&quot; (1990; Warner; PG). Yes, there is a movieabout good dreams. This recent release is a series of eight breathtakingvignettes written and directed by the famed Japanese film auteur. Filmingfantasies on such diverse subjects as art, nature and nuclear power, Kurosawahas imbued these waking dreams with heartfelt emotion, luminous beauty andsoothingly surreal imagery.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  D.
