The U.S. government's chief environmental official,William Reilly, said the possible dangers posed by theunexpectedly large thinning of the ozone shield over the U.S.and other parts of the world are &quot;serious and worrisome.&quot; Hebased his comments on new satellite data from the NationalAeronautics and Space Administration that give the bestdocumentation to date of ozone loss around the world.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Reilly said the findings may necessitate speeding upinternational deadlines for phasing out chemicals widely usedin refrigeration and in some industries that are suspected ofdestroying ozone molecules in the upper atmosphere. But hestopped short of calling for changes in an internationaltreaty to phase out chlorofluorocarbons and other chemicals.   The Environmental Protection Agency predicts that thethinning of the ozone shield will let in more harmfulultraviolet rays from the sun and lead to as many as 12million more skin cancers and more than 210,000 additionalskin-cancer deaths in the U.S. during the next 50 years.   Depletion of the ozone layer also can lead to eyecataracts and damage to agriculture and marine life.   The NASA satellite data indicate two disturbingdevelopments. They show that winter ozone layers weredepleted 4% to 8% compared with a decade ago -- twice as muchas computer models previously estimated -- in large parts ofthe U.S., Europe and the mid-latitudes throughout thesouthern and northern hemispheres. Depletion rates vary, withgreater depletion as one moves toward the North or Southpoles. The greatest depletion in the U.S. was detected in theareas north of a line stretching from Reno, Nevada, to Denverto Philadelphia. World-wide, the severest depletion, theso-called &quot;ozone hole,&quot; has been detected over Antarcticaduring winter.   Secondly, ozone depletion -- as much as 4% to 5% -- wasfound for the first time to continue into April and May, atime when ultraviolet rays could have even greater effectbecause crops are sprouting and people spend more timeoutdoors.   &quot;We have to say this is one of the major findings(concerning ozone) in the last decade,&quot; said Robert Watson ofNASA, an atmospheric scientist who reviewed the data and isone of the world's leading ozone experts. He said additionalpreliminary information also suggests the rate of ozonedepletion is accelerating, not simply that scientists hadmiscalculated ozone levels.   Environmental groups expressed alarm over NASA'spreliminary findings, which are sure to ignite new tensionswith industries that make or use CFCs and that alreadybelieve they are moving aggressively to phase them out by theyear 2000.   Dwight Bedsole of Du Pont Co., the world's biggestproducer of CFCs and a trailblazer in developing CFCsubstitutes, said: &quot;There is little or nothing Du Pont can dothat it is not doing today to speed up the transition&quot; tosafer alternatives. He said the biggest problem is thatcompanies around the world couldn't meet an earlier deadlinefor retrofitting $135 billion of equipment that uses thecompounds.   The nations signing the Montreal Protocol, the 1987international treaty phasing out CFCs, are scheduled to meetin June and will discuss the results. But any changes to thetreaty wouldn't be likely until the June 1992 meeting,officials indicated.   Mr. Reilly, head of the EPA, indicated he wants to use theU.S. agency's powers to accelerate the use of ozone-safesubstitutes. He also suggested that the internationalcommunity might want to sweeten economic incentives to getdeveloping nations, the fastest-growing users of CFCs, offthe chemicals before the current treaty deadline of 2010.   The treaty gives developing nations 10 more years thandeveloped nations to stop using CFCs. But some EuropeanCommunity nations already support moving up the 2000 deadlinefor a CFC ban in developed nations to 1997.   Also certain to arise is a renewed call for restrictionson CFC substitutes now being developed that are still harmful-- though less so than CFCs -- to the ozone shield.   Separately, two scientists at the National Oceanic andAtmospheric Administration released findings that suggest itis more likely than previously believed that the Earth willwarm significantly in the next century.   A.R. Ravishankara said he and a colleague determined thatmethane lasts 25% longer in the atmosphere than previouslypredicted. Methane accounts for about 15% of the atmosphere'sgreenhouse gases, which form a transparent blanket around theEarth and keep heat from escaping into space. Mr.Ravishankara said methane lasts about 12.5 years in theatmosphere instead of 10 years, as previous believed.   If the sources of methane keep increasing, he said, moreof it will collect in the atmosphere than anticipated incomputer models, increasing the likelihood of global warming.The scientists published their work in the journal Nature.   ---   Bob Davis contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
