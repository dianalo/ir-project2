This notice officially begins theprocess for Program Year (PY) 1989 which began on July 1, and invites applicationsfor topic areas outlined under part II. Applications for PY 1989 will beaccepted through March 31, 1990.Approved topic areas of interest to ETA for PY 1989 are summarized, andexamples of proposals unlikely to be funded are included. Interested partiesare advised that field-initiated research and demonstration proposals willbe funded primarily through this competitive process. Any funding of proposalssubmitted outside of the process announced in this notice will be on alimited basis.This solicitation for Grant Applications (SGA) is unrestricted. Proposalsmay be submitted by individuals and organizations from the public and privatesectors. Grant awards resulting from this solicitation will not be fee-bearing.<ITAG tagnum="84">Part I_Background</ITAG>Section 452 of title IV, part D, of the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA)provides for the establishment of research and demonstration (Randamp;D)programs to overcome employment and training problems and improve employmentopportunities of low-skilled and disadvantaged workers. Section 453 providesfor financial assistance to pilot projects assisting persons who face particulardisadvantages in gaining employment, and to such projects addressing skillsshortages critical to national objectives. Other sections of Part D providefor multistate, evaluation and training and technical assistance programswhich may not always be relevant to this solicitation.Historically, ETA has managed its responsibilities for the provision ofResearch, Demonstration and Evaluation (RDandamp;E) programs through threebasic approaches: (1) Annual competitions for grants and contracts;  (2)annual funding for grantees with established, long-term relationships withETA; and (3) proposals submitted from interested individuals and organizations.In the past several years, ETA has increased the proportion of its RDandamp;Ecompetitive awards, resulting in a decrease in the number of field-initiatedproposals funded. However, significant numbers of field-initiated proposalshave continued to be submitted during the last two program years.<ITAG tagnum="84">Part II_The New Competitive Process for Field-Initiated Randamp;D Proposals</ITAG>To improve the review and selection of field-initiated proposals, ETA isinstituting a process of competing virtually all proposals throughout thecourse of the PY. This procedure will not only increase the competitivebase of the R,Dandamp;E program, but will also add to the consistency, andtherefore fairness, of the review process itself. Notification of the competitionwill be made each PY in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.ETA will describe its major topics of interest and will clearly indicatewhat will not be acceptable. Other submissions will be accepted and reviewedbut will be awarded on a limited basis. All offerors may enter this competitionat any time during the PY. Panels will be established quarterly, to theextent possible, to review all proposals received during that three-monthperiod. All offerors will be notified of the disposition of their proposals,and winners will be announced in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4>This procedure is designed to supplement not supplant the competitive processfor individual grants and contracts announced in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>and the <T3>Commerce Business Daily</T3>. Proposals will be accepted in the areasnoted below unless they appear to be circumventing an announced SGA orRequest for Proposals (RFP) competition. The areas of interest are sufficientlybroad to permit consideration of unique, innovative aspects of researchand demonstration beyond the scope of announced competitions.A. Program Year 1989 AgendaOn September 6, 1989, ETA announced in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(54 FR 37033) the PY 1989 Research, Evaluation,Pilot and Demonstration (R,E,Pandamp;D) agenda describing the topic areasof major interest to the Administration which included the following:<ITAG tagnum="15">_Workplace 2000</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Youth Opportunities</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Workplace Literacy </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Workplace Adjustment Assistance and Adult Programs. </ITAG>Applications submitted through this SGA should address these priority topics.Focused projects within some of these areas are also planned to be awardedthrough major procurement competitions.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Workplace 2000</ITAG>The U.S. economy is expected to continue to grow at least at its currentrate through the year 2000. Nonetheless, the efficiency of our labor marketswill be severely tested. More sophisticated jobs will demand greater skills.Fewer young people will be entering the labor market, and a growing fractionwill be minorities, who as a group, are educationally disadvantaged. Greaterflexibility will be demanded of all workers, but particularly the middle-agedworker. In the anticipated tight labor market of the year 2000, employerswill be forced to either seek out and invest in workers heretofore underutilized,or to bid up wages or export jobs overseas.Employer-based training is one such method of investing in workers. Recentstudy findings indicate that it is a primary source of productivity improvement.However, there are gaps in the research needed to fully understand learningin the workplace. More information is needed on how to make learning onthe job more effective and efficient for both workers and employers. Workplace 2000 proposals should focus on the preparation of workers andchanges and trends in employment as we approach the turn of the century.Recent studies have predicted the need to increase the following: workers'skill levels for the jobs of the near future, worker flexibility to newworking conditions, the involvement of population groups not now fullyutilized, employer involvement in worker training, and options for fringebenefits. Briefly, more time, attention and funds must be directed to improvinghuman capital if we are to be a productive and competitive force in worldeconomies.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Youth Opportunities </ITAG>Improving the educational preparedness of workers is a challenge we mustmeet to be competitive into the 21st century. This is most important forour young people. Today's youth at risk of dropping out of school are ourentry level workers of the next two decades. They face jobs demanding higherskills in math, reading and communications. Yet recent studies have shownthat many of these youth are reading, writing, and computing at levelsbelow present day expectations. Further, many of these youth are disillusionedwith schools, and fail to see education's connection with good paying jobs.In some inner cities, as many as 50 percent of youth drop out of school.Further efforts must also be focused on young people who complete highschool but do not go to college. Businesses report that their levels ofjob preparedness are frequently inadequate.Proposals are invited that offer new concepts to motivate and train youthfor tomorrow's workforce, to increase the basic skills and employabilityof at-risk youth, including innovative and replicable programs/optionsfor returning dropouts to school, and unique, workable concepts for remedialand job training programs. Innovative research studies on selected youthemployability issues are also invited.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Workplace Literacy</ITAG>As the remainder of this century unfolds, it is expected that jobs requiringhigher levels of literacy and analytic skills will increase, and thoserequiring only strength and manual ability will shrink. Further, the populationgroups presently in jobs with lesser skill requirements can expect a moredifficult time in the job markets ahead unless their literacy skills areincreased. In addition to increased skills, increased flexibility willbe required to enable workers to adapt to new working conditions, new technologyand new environments. In the rapidly growing service sector, the demandfor workers will shift frequently in response to customer demand. Workermobility will be necessary to fill these jobs. Effective mobility willrequire a universal method of certifying skill levels in order to facilitatethe movement of workers from one employer to another.In the past several years, ETA has undertaken a wide variety of programsto explore, test and demonstrate new learning techniques and programs forgroups in particular need of enhancing their workplace literacy skills,and efforts to assess literacy skill levels.Improving the workplace literacy levels of Americans of all ages continuesto be a major priority. As technology changes, workers are required tokeep up with it to retain or grow in their jobs. Workplace literacy includesmath and analytical thinking skills along with the ability to read, comprehendand communicate. Studies have shown that learning these skills ``in context,''_i.e.,relating them to the workplace_is an effective approach for many learners.Applications are invited for research or demonstrations in the broad arenaof increasing the workplace literacy of youth and adults. Offerors shoulddirect their efforts to unique methods, tools or technologies for trainingmore efficiently and effectively, and should focus their studies or demonstrationon learning on the job or in a workplace context.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Work Adjustment Assistance and Adult Programs</ITAG>Workers needing adjustment assistance are many and varied. Changes in theeconomy and technologies have displaced many workers. Many of these workers,displaced from manufacturing sectors, are ill prepared for evolving jobs,primarily in the service sectors. Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) (Chapter2 of Title II of the Trade Act of 1974) and Economic Dislocation and WorkerAdjustment Assistance (EDWAA) (Title III of JTPA) programs are availableto assist dislocated workers to train for and find new employment. Majornew legislation was enacted last year substantially revising and expandingthese important programs.Other workers face conflicts between their jobs and family responsibilities,including the care of children and elders. Women, work and family issuesare also included under this topic. Since the mid-1940's the labor forceparticipation rate for women has grown dramatically from about 33 percentto more than 70 percent. In 1987, 66.7 percent of women with children participatedin the labor force. The rate for mothers with young toddlers was 55.2 percent,more than double the rate of only 20 years ago. Contrary to popular belief,most working women (78 percent) work full time, and only 17 percent workpart time voluntarily. Estimates for the remainder of the century indicatethat women will increase their labor force participation, but at a slowerrate. By the year 2000, the labor force participation rate for women isexpected to reach 81 percent, while that of men will be nearly 93 percent.Applications are invited that seek to improve the employability of theseworkers and potential workers. Proposals might include concepts and projectsto assist dislocated workers and disadvantaged men and women (includingsingle mothers on welfare) to receive job training and employment, or newways to provide training or job adjustments that also allow for appropriatecare for children and/or elderly family members. Additional innovativeprojects are invited which assist JPA-eligible disadvantaged, handicapped,limited English speaking, and other targeted groups in need of specialassistance to prepare for and gain employment at a living wage, and projectsgeared to improving the delivery of JTPA programs at all levels.B. Application ProceduresProposals are expected to be complete and readily understandable. No contractswill be made to elicit further information from the offeror or to clarifymeaning. At a minimum, proposals should include the following:<ITAG tagnum="81">Technical Proposal_Part A</ITAG>1. Statement of the problem and brief summary of the proposed solution/project.2.

Theproposal package shall consist of two separate and distinct parts. PartA shall contain a detailed technical proposal and Part B shall containa detailed budget. Part A shall not include or make reference to costs.Proposals shall be submitted to: James C. DeLuca, Grant Officer, Employmentand Training Administration, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW., Room C-4305,Washington, DC 20210.C. Criteria for EvaluationThe proposals will be reviewed and paneled quarterly. To the extend possible,proposals will be reviewed in the quarter they are received. The panel'sevaluation is advisory to the ETA Grant Officer. The final decision toaward a grant will be made by the Grant Officer, after considering thepanel's review. The Grant Officer's decision will be based on what he determinesis most advantageous to the Government in terms of technical quality andother factors. The evaluation criteria are as follows:andbullet; The <T3>quality and soundness</T3> of the project design, methodology and approach.(35 points)andbullet; <T3>Qualifications</T3> and capability of <T3>personnel and the organization.</T3> (20 points)andbullet; The <T3>innovativeness or uniqueness</T3> of the concept, methodology or approach.(20 points) andbullet; The <T3>relevance</T3> to government training and employment policy and thepotential for <T3>broad application </T3>of project results. (15 points)andbullet; <T3>Matching or contributed resources </T3>in support of the project and,for demonstrations, the <T3>ability to continue</T3> the project without these R, Dandamp;E fundsbeyond the grant period. (10 points)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Cost will be reviewed in terms of its reasonableness and what is mostadvantageous to the government. (Projects in excess of $300,000 are seldomfunded due to budget constraints and the desire to fund a variety of researchand demonstrations.)D. Proposals Outside Agency Priorities The JTPA program is not authorized to fund certain projects, and due tothe need to conserve limited resources, will restrict its funding to projectsthat are in line with agency goals and objectives. The following list isnot all-inclusive, but does indicate proposals that are frequently submittedbut not funded; such proposals will not be considered for funding:_Proposals that include costs associated with purchasing buildings, capitalequipment, or extensive computer equipment. This does not preclude submissionsthat include reasonable computer costs associated with word or data processingto manage the research, pilot or demonstration effort. _Proposals for the establishment of small businesses, even if the directoutcome of that business is the employment and training of disadvantagedindividuals._Proposals for loans or grants for personal financial assistance._Proposals for projects/operations providing on-going training and employmentassistance using established service delivery methods. Such successfulprogram operators should contact the State or local JTPA Administratorif they seek to become service providers._Proposals for local one-time labor market studies._Proposals for projects or functions that are, have been, or are plannedto be publicly completed._Proposals that fail to provide sufficient information for an adequateassessment of their merits.<ITAG tagnum="81">The Proposal Review Process</ITAG>All proposals will be acknowledged when they are received; offerors willbe notified of the approximate time of the next panel. Two to three timesa year, all proposals received will be reviewed by a panel composed ofrepresentatives from the major offices within ETA and others as appropriate.Each proposal will be reviewed by all panel members who will rate themon their individual merits using the criteria established in this SGA.The panel will make recommendations for funding to the ETA Grant Officer.All offerors will be informed of the disposition of their proposals.<ITAG tagnum="21">Signed at Washington, DC, this 16th Day of November, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Roberts T.
