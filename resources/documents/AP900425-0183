Joe Frank Harris defended state mentalhealth officials Wednesday in the case of a man who was releasedfrom a state mental hospital the day before he opened fire in asuburban shopping mall.   One person was killed and four were wounded in Tuesday's attack.   James Calvin Brady, 31, had been released from Georgia RegionalHospital, a state psychiatric facility in Atlanta, on Monday, saidJames Ledbetter, commissioner of the Department of Human Resources.   Psychiatrists had judged that he was not harmful to himself orothers, Ledbetter said after reviewing records in the case.   ``It looked to me like all the procedures, rules and regulationswere followed, and the clinical decision was made to release him,''Ledbetter said.   ``It's a very difficult decision to predict future behavior, andthat's essentially what our staff is called on to do. ... We arenot perfect,'' he said.   Harris and Ledbetter said Brady's release was not due toovercrowding.   The governor said the state is ``sincere in trying ... to doeverything that we can to prevent something like this fromhappening. In this case, I think it was being done.''   The gunman, smiling and wearing a gray suit, fired a handguninto a lunch-time crowd at Perimeter Mall. After throwing his guninto a trash can, Brady surrendered just outside the mall's mainentrance, police said.   DeKalb County police said the gunman carried documents from thehospital in Atlanta, indicating he had been diagnosed as havinghomicidal tendencies.   A DeKalb County judge Wednesday ordered the mental hospital toturn over Brady's records to police. Ledbetter said the Departmentof Human Resources was seeking judicial guidance on what exactlycan be disclosed without intruding on doctor-patient privilege.   Police said Brady was taken late Tuesday to Central StateHospital at Milledgeville, another state-run mental facility.   Officers said Brady bought the revolver and 12 rounds ofhollow-point ammunition, a type designed to expand on impact andcause particularly severe wounds, for $139 Monday at Avondale PawnShop in an eastern Atlanta suburb.   Detective Lt. Rodney Maddox described the gun as ``a cut-downbarrel version of a large-frame revolver and said it ``lookedpretty worn.''   ``How did he get the gun? Why did he get the gun?'' Maddox said.``We don't have a good answer to that and may never know why.''   Georgia law does not restrict the sale of handguns or rifles butrequires a license for anyone who carries a concealed weapon. Sucha license cannot be obtained within five years of release from apsychiatric hospital.   Harris said Wednesday the shooting spree ``makes a very strongstatement'' for stronger gun laws in Georgia, but he acknowledgedthat public sentiment ``has just not risen in support enough topass something of that nature.''   Rambling, disjointed notes found in the apartment Brady had beenliving in said he had taken crack cocaine and then met two peoplein California who created a machine that would control his mind.   ``If I got the public at large outcry and attention of why Ibecame insane, the public would bring these (two people) toaccounting,'' said the notes.   Brady was a native of Anniston, Ala. His relatives in Alabamaexpressed shock over the incident. His stepmother, Sadie Bolton,said Brady seemed fine when she last saw him around Thanksgiving.   Brady's half-brother told The Times of Contra Costa County,Calif., that Brady had a drug problem and was ``talking crazy''before he left the San Francisco area two months ago.   ``He was talking stupid,'' said the half-brother, who asked thathis name not be used. ``He said that there were some people whowere controlling this box in his stomach.''   One of the wounded people remained in critical conditionWednesday at Shallowford Hospital and one was in stable condition.A third was treated and released and the fourth was expected to bereleased after treatment for leg wounds.</TEXT></DOC>
