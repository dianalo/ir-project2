Still, the decision was widely expected after enactment two weeksago of Sandamp;L bailout legislation, and thrift officials are looking onthe bright side.   The 6-0 ruling Thursday will bring more money from commercialbanks into the troubled savings business.   ``The healthy institutions are happy to have more peopleinterested in their stock,'' said Dennis J. Jacobe, researchdirector of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, which opposedthe rule when it was proposed two years ago.   Under the federal regulatory scheme, banks and savingsassociations were kept strictly separate until 1982, when Congressdecided to allow bank holding companies to buy ailing thrifts.   In September 1987, the Fed proposed opening all thrifts topurchase by banks but delayed its decision after it ran into abarrage of criticism from Sandamp;Ls, small banks and members of Congress.   When the Bush administration originally drafted its Sandamp;L bill sixmonths ago, it had called for a two-year delay before banks couldbuy healthy Sandamp;Ls on the theory that banks wouldn't want to buyailing thrifts if they had the chance to buy sound institutions.   But Congress scrapped the waiting period in an effort to enticebanks into investing in marginal, but still solvent, savingsassociations.   James R. Barth, chief economist of the Office of ThriftSupervision, says solvent Sandamp;Ls will have to raise $30 billion tomeet new capital requirements going into effect by the end of theyear.   He estimated that half of the approximately 2,600 solvent Sandamp;Ls inthe nation, representing 85 percent of the industry's assets, fallshort of the new standard.   However, critics warn that thrifts owned by banks mayde-emphasize home mortgage lending and eventually convert to banks.   ``This just adds another nail to the coffin ... of a separatethrift industry,'' said Diane Casey, director of regulatory affairsfor the Independent Bankers Association of America, which representscommunity banks.   The independent bankers also complain that the decision is aback-door method of allowing companies such as Citicorp, thenation's largest banking company, to circumvent state laws thatprotect their banks from out-of-state takeovers.   ``This is going to substantially broaden interstate banking. Webelieve that should be a state decision, not a federal decision,''Casey said.   The Fed, however, says only four states _ Iowa, Kansas, Montanaand North Dakota _ ban interstate banking.   ``It does have the tendency to accelerate the pace of interstatebanking,'' said board member John P. LaWare. ``But I think that ishappening in any case.''   James D. McLaughlin of the American Bankers Association, whichhad pushed for the change, welcomed the Fed ruling but quarreledwith a provision that will prevent bank holding companies fromacquiring thrift subsidiaries that sell insurance or invest in realestate.   Those are areas prohibited to banks, but not Sandamp;L subsidiaries.   ``There's nothing in here that alters in any way the separationof commercial activity and industrial activity from banking,'' saidboard member Wayne D. Angell.   In related action earlier this week, the Fed lifted so-called``tandem operating restrictions,'' which had prevented Citicorp andMichigan National Corp. from fully integrating Sandamp;Ls they owned inCalifornia, Illinois and Florida into their banking operations.</TEXT></DOC>
