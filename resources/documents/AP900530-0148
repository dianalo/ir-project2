Price H. Gwynn III of Charlotte, N.C., described himself as along-shot candidate who nevertheless sensed he might eventually winleadership of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A).   He won on a second ballot cast by the 605 commissioners meetingin the faith's 202nd General Assembly to pick a successor to TheRev. Joan SalmonCampbell. Gwynn, 67, received 322 votes, or almost53 percent.   ``I'm not a renegade,'' said Gwynn, who earlier had roused theGeneral Assembly with a speech critical of church bureaucracy.   He said a belief in the divinity of Jesus Christ and hisResurrection is all that is needed to heal rifts and a membershipmalaise affecting the 2.9 million-member church.   The church's membership has steadily declined over the past twodecades, losing more than 120,000 in the past three years and 30percent of its membership since 1970.   Gwynn said the cure lies not in the General Assembly, but in thechurch's individual members and local congregations.   ``If you are warm and inviting and the love of God is visible,then I'm not concerned,'' he said. ``Rising water lifts all boats.''   The new moderator, who will serve for a year, said the churchleadership needs to do a better job keeping abreast of the times.   ``Change is driven by belief and faith and conviction. It is nolonger driven by technology. If we shoot ourselves in the foot,we're going to have to answer for that,'' he said. ``This could bea five million-member denomination by the year 2000.''   Gwynn is the eighth moderator since factions of the churchreunited in 1983, healing a Civil War-era split over slavery. Themoderator presides over the General Assembly and represents thechurch for the remainder of the year.   Gwynn said he believes leadership may be out of touch with thechurchgoer, who worries more about the church itself than issuessuch as whether homosexuals should be ordained as ministers _ atopic the General Assembly likely will take up next week.   ``The question I'm asked is, `Do we have our act together uphere ... can we put aside our differences to get our act togetherin the world?''' Gwynn told the assembly, which meets through June6.   But emphasizing unity does not mean there is no place fordissension, he said.   ``We're going to disagree,'' said Gwynn, who pointed outPresbyterians have a history of factionalism dating back to theCivil War. ``Nobody should be shocked. But we don't have to agreeto work together.''   Gwynn is a semiretired president of a Charlotte packing companyand chairman of the board of Presbyterian Hospital and PresbyterianHealth Services Corp.   An elder in the Steele Creek church in Charlotte and father ofthree, Gwynn said he is not an ``activist'' and has no plans forradical changes. He said he could not support ordination ofhomosexuals, who he said are sinners deserving of God's love butnot of the ministry.   Gwynn said he supports ``responsible choice'' in dealing withabortion. He said his experience with hospitals has taught him thatthose who suffer when abortions are unavailable are the ``poor, thepowerless and the unwanted child.''   About 750 Presbyterians from around the U.S. are attending the10-day conference in Salt Lake City, the first meeting of theProtestant denomination in predominantly Mormon Utah.</TEXT></DOC>
