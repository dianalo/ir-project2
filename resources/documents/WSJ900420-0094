Not that I now know any more about the earth'stemperature. But I sure know a lot more about the politics.   This isn't meant to be cynical. Politics is healthy and onthe environment more political skepticism is desperately,achingly needed. Environmental debates are cast as moralityplays, black hats versus white, polluters against those witha social conscience. But they also have as much to do withinterests as intentions. On global warming as much as ontrade or taxes, it helps to peer behind the moral posturing.</LP><TEXT>   For example, I had no idea how easy it is to cover one ofthese green conferences. Environmentalists do the work foryou. The White House may have planned this meeting of 18nations to fulfill a George Bush campaign promise. But theenviros turned out to be the better politicians.   &quot;Have you seen the White House talking points yet?&quot; askedthe cordial and intense Rafe Pomerance of the World ResourcesInstitute, a green hothouse. I had to admit I hadn't. &quot;You'vegot to get those talking points. They really lay out thewhole White House strategy.&quot;   So Dan Becker, Rafe's pal at the Sierra Club, pulled thetalking points from his bag. Among the White House's shockingorders to its troops: &quot;Don't let reporters position thisconference as an attempt to delay serious decisions on thisissue.&quot; In other words, the White House practices media spincontrol. Now, there's a scoop.   The irony is especially rich because the spin control thatreally worked was by the enviros. After President Bush gave aTuesday speech about the scientific and economic&quot;uncertainty&quot; of global warming, the greens lined up outsideto say the U.S. wasn't doing enough.   Mr. Pomerance (&quot;The Europeans are leading . . . &quot;) for 30seconds, then the Sierra Club's Mr. Becker (&quot;a smokescreen&quot;),followed by the Natural Resources Defense Council (&quot;anembarrassment&quot;) and the Union of Concerned Scientists (&quot;oneproblem is free-market ideology&quot;). Seriatim sound-bites.   Most networks and papers led with this critique, not withMr. Bush's message. It doesn't take a cynic to understand howmuch this publicity will help Sierra Club fund-raising.   Some Europeans -- Germany, France the Dutch -- are alsobig warming mavens. They want the U.S., the biggest producerof greenhouse gases, to impose taxes or remake cars andtoasters to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 20% by theyear 2000. But it's probably no accident that the Dutch onlyemit 1% of the world's carbon gases. Or that the French havehuge reserves of clean nuclear power (spurned by our owngreens). Or that Germany could get a 20% reduction just bycleaning up East Germany.   One senior White House aide, a green himself, points outthat the politics of global warming is a world version of ourown Clean Air Act. The Europeans are trying to do to the U.S.what Sen. Robert Byrd of coal-mining West Virginia did toMidwest utilities: Stick the other guy with the bill. TheU.S., more reliant on coal and full of car-happysuburbanites, would have to sacrifice much more. Meanwhile,the Eurocrats would still get green credit back home.   The Japanese also don't seem to mind if the U.S. redesignsits cars to spill less carbon dioxide, especially if they cansell us the cleaner cars. But please don't mention methane,probably an even more pernicious greenhouse gas. &quot;You cannotabolish rice paddies&quot; is the way one witty Japanese delegateput it.   Of course those pesky carbon-guzzlers in the developingworld also have an agenda, though almost no one noticed. OnTuesday, the Polish delegate gave a splendid speech about theimportance of free markets to a clean environment. But thepress corps had already left to listen to the enviros andWest Europeans.   The man from Zaire (per capita income: some $170 a year)pointed out that about 80% of his nation's energy comes fromwood. Residents of Kinshasa are not clamoring for the Dutch&quot;carbon tax&quot; (a levy on fossil-fuels), though they willaccept nuclear plants if Americans want to donate them.   If all this sounds amusing, brace yourself because it'sjust the beginning. The world's diplomats know a good thingwhen they see it, and they're planning green conferences asfar ahead as the calender permits. Al Gore, the Tennesseesenator and warming maven, is even having his own&quot;Interparliamentary Conference on the Global Environment&quot;next month -- a sure sign that the politics is hot. Whoknows, maybe Mr. Gore's group will even debate the substanceof global warming.   Ah, yes, the substance: As far as this layman can tell,everyone agrees the earth has gotten slightly warmer in thelast 100 years. But most of this was before 1930, whengreenhouse gases couldn't have been the cause. The scientificmodels also say that enough carbon gas is already in the airto make us warmer, yet satellite data from the last 10 yearsshow almost no warming at all. No one seems to know what toexpect. Greater cloud cover may make the world hotter, ormaybe cooler. Ditto for the oceans. And even if the earthdoes warm by two or three degrees, the impact may betolerable. Shorelines could flood, but Canada could bloom.   Tepid stuff, shorn of the political hype. Which may be whyat a conference supposedly devoted to global warming, theweather so rarely came up. At one point I asked a White Houseofficial whether he thought global warming was occurring.&quot;You know, I just don't know,&quot; he said. &quot;But we both knowthat's not the point.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
