U.S. District Judge Mark L. Wolf said he imposed ``what mightseem to some a relatively short sentence'' against 64-year-old AhmadModarressi and his son, Majid, 30.   Wolf said mitigating factors included the elder Modarressi's ageand poor health, the younger Modarressi's naivete and the father'sbelief that the U.S. government was interested in improvingrelations with Iran.   Wolf characterized the younger Modarressi, who appeared in courtwith his American wife and 4-year-old daughter, as ``extremelynaive, perhaps more accruately described as extremely stupid.''   Among the son's gaffes, Wolf said, were suggesting a $60 millionillegal deal over the telephone to an unknown Raytheon Co. worker,not knowing what a TOW missile was and inquiring about Stingermissiles simply because he had heard them mentioned in a TV newsreport about Afghanistan.   Wolf sentenced Ahmad Modarressi to 14 months in prison, including10 months he has already served. As an Iranian national, he could bedeported after his release.   Majid Modarressi was sentenced to 189 days in jail, the amount oftime he has already served. He will also be required to perform 500hours of community service in Cincinnati, where he has been anunemployed architect.   Federal prosecutors had suggested a 2-year sentence for both forviolating the U.S. Arms Export Control Act by attempting to buymicrowave tubes for the Hawk anti-aircraft missile system and sellthem to Iran.   The father pleaded guilty during their trial in U.S. DistrictCourt while the son was convicted Oct. 26 by a jury after a 19-daytrial.   The trial stemmed from a 10-month investigation in which a U.S.Customs Service agent posed as an employee of Raytheon, theLexington-based firm that makes the Hawk system.   An undercover agent recorded conversations in which he pretendedto agree to steal microwave amplification tubes from Raytheon andsell them for $280,000 to the Modarressis.   The Iranians were arrested Jan. 15 in a suburban Boston freightyard where they had come to inspect the so-called twystron andklystron tubes.   The Modarressis said they planned to disguise the tubes aswell-drilling equipment and ship them to Iran via a third countrysuch as Libya, Turkey or Switzerland. The tubes are a criticalcomponent of the radar system that allows the Hawk to blast jetaircraft out of the sky.   The United States has prosecuted at least 46 cases of armssmuggling or attempted arms smuggling to Iran since 1981, when thecountry's 8-year war with neighboring Iraq began.   A truce in the war was announced Aug. 20. But U.S. officials saidIran has maintained its effort to obtain spare parts for itsmilitary hardware, the bulk of which was bought from the UnitedStates by the American-backed Shah government before the 1979Islamic revolution.   U.S. officials said the Modarressi case pointed out the dire needIran has for parts. Though the initial attempted deal was for$280,000, tapes revealed the Iranians discussed buying up to $60million in U.S. weapons, including Stinger missiles and spare partsfor the F-4 and F-14 jets.</TEXT></DOC>
