The new systems involve electronic tags that drivers affixto their cars. When a car passes through a toll plaza, amachine reads the tag's ID number and then bills the driverfor tolls at the end of the month.   Highways in Texas, Louisiana and Oklahoma already havesystems like this in place. California, New Jersey, New Yorkand Pennsylvania are working on similar projects, and severalother states are considering the collectors.   Proponents of these systems say they cut down on trafficand smog. But privacy advocates say the systems also couldgive state governments a powerful new tool to monitor theircitizens.   &quot;They'll know when you've gone, and which way you'vetraveled,&quot; says Chris Hibbert, a member of ComputerProfessionals for Social Responsibility.   A maker of the new toll technology, Amtech of Dallas,counters that the devices are optional. Drivers can still optto go through an old-fashioned toll-booth. But that choicemay cost money. Oklahoma, for example, charges 25% to 30%more for drivers who don't have a tag.   Mr. Hibbert, a manager at software maker Xanadu, islobbying for systems that would let a driver anonymously buya tag with prepaid tolls. The tag's account could be debitedeach time a driver passes a checkpoint.                                                                                                          Banks May Be Too Lax   With Dial-Your-Account                                                                                                          IN THEIR RUSH to offer account information over thetelephone, banks are making it too easy for snoops to learnfinancial secrets, a San Francisco consumer group contends.   The group, Consumer Action, surveyed the 24-hourinformation systems of 13 big California banks. Like similarsystems elsewhere, they typically let consumers usepush-button phones to find out current balances and whetherchecks have cleared.   Consumer Action found that 11 of the banks don't requireany password beyond a social security number and an accountnumber. That isn't good enough security, the group's reportargues. Consumers disclose account numbers every time theywrite or deposit checks. Social security numbers show up indozens of places, including insurance forms and even somestates' drivers licenses.   The group cited the case of a Cupertino, Calif., woman inthe midst of a divorce who contended her husband was dialingup data from her separate bank account. She couldn't keep heraccount number a secret because it appeared on the back ofsupport checks after she deposited them.   Banks defend the systems as a good balance of privacy andconvenience. Many banks don't want customers to use theirautomated-teller-machine passwords over the phone, where theymight be intercepted. BankAmerica, California's biggest bank,also says it offers customers the option of blocking allphone access to their account information.                                                                                                          Attacks on Junk Mail   Are Proliferating, Too                                                                                                          THE GROWING backlash against junk mail and mailing-listdatabases has led to a flurry of proposed countermeasures,both serious and fanciful. Most are the pet campaigns ofindividuals.   Henry Keultjes, an Ohio investor, is lobbying Congress andthe U.S. Postal Service to create an &quot;unlisted address&quot;system. He wants to expand on the postal service's plan tobuild an electronic database of U.S. addresses by marking alllistings that don't want to receive junk mail and forbiddingmailers to target them.   James Smith, a Marlboro, Conn., computer professional, hasanother ambitious high-tech idea. Writing in Computerworld,he proposes fee-paying personal data banks. Households couldcontribute all the data they want, and mailers would have topay them a royalty for each use.   Others wage low-tech crusades. Dorcas Miller, a Chelsea,Maine, writer, publishes &quot;The Stop Junk Mail Book.&quot; Itcontains useful tips on getting off mailing lists, with 32prepared postcards to send to mailers. David Lusterman,himself a junk-mail copywriter, proposes a two-compartment&quot;In and Out Mailbox&quot; in an Utne Reader article. When lettercarriers deliver mail, they would also empty out the unwantedjunk mail and cart it off to paper recyclers.   These ideas dismay the Direct Marketing Association, whichoffers its own service for households that don't wantunsolicited mail. It also argues that the Lusterman ideawould disturb &quot;the sanctity of the mailbox.&quot;                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          REP. ROBERT WISE (D., W.Va.) is pushing a proposal to plugsome loopholes in the Privacy Act of 1974, arguing thattechnology has left the law behind. The act limits thefederal government's disclosures of personal data. The Wisemeasure would make it explicit that the act coverscomputerized data and would shrink a big exception for&quot;routine&quot; disclosures. . . . Sneaky video-camera buffs arebuying lenses with periscope-style mirrors, which shoot at a90-degree angle to the right or left. For example: the $39.95Cambron Super Snooper, which the Cambridge Camera store inNew York calls a brisk seller. Such lenses offer &quot;an easy wayto get natural shots of shy people,&quot; Video Magazine suggests.</TEXT></DOC>
