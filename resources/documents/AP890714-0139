Gen. Nurul Haq Ulumi.   Kandahar, a city of 300,000 people about 70 miles from thePakistan border and 250 miles southwest of Kabul, already has beenbombed, and row after row of homes and stores are locked up.   The city has been the scene of some of the fiercest battles inthe decade-old war between the Soviet-backed government and theU.S.-supported Moslem guerrillas.   The guerrillas have been trying for more than 18 months tocapture the city. Since May, the Afghan armed forces have beenpreparing for a major offensive by the guerrillas.   Tanks manned by gunners are stationed throughout the city.Soldiers wait in wheat fields, their rocket launchers ready to fire.   Members of the local militia pass through the streets, wavingtheir Kalikovs, a short-barreled, high-velocity variant of theSoviet-made Kalashnikov rifle.   On Koh-i-Mahi, a strategic peak once used by the guerrillas tolaunch an attack, swarms of government troops stand guard.   Soviet and Afghan officials have accused Pakistan, the base ofthe main seven guerrilla groups, of massing 10,000 to 15,000 troopsnear the border to help the guerrillas, or mujahedeen (Islamic holywarriors). Pakistan denies the charge.   ``We understand that this time the opponents will be aided in abig way by Pakistan,'' Ulumi said Thursday.   He said the government had received information that Pakistan hadmassed 200 tanks and 40 fighter bombers at a base in the city ofQuetta.   ``We are holding our positions. But if we are attacked we will goafter them and there will be massive bloodshed,'' he said.   Capturing a city would give the guerrillas a base for the interimgovernment they formed in Pakistan in February.   The guerrillas, who control most of the countryside, have beentrying since early March to seize the eastern city of Jalalabad.   Although the guerrillas captured several key outposts aroundJalalabad in the early days of the assault, the government has heldthe city.   Foreign defense experts in Kabul doubt the guerrillas have themanpower or the firepower to launch another major attack on anAfghan city, but President Najib's soldiers appear to be taking nochances.   Even during the Moslem holiday of Eid al-Adha, security postsaround the city remained alert.   In anticipation of a renewed attack, the government has deployedfresh troops to Kandahar and stationed MiG-21 fighter bombers at itsairport, according to a senior Afghan army officer, speaking oncondition of anonymity. He declined to disclose specific figures.</TEXT></DOC>
