<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-08-0118 </DOCNO><TEXT>The objective of the Biosyn project was the commerical demonstration ofan oxygen blown gasifier to produce synthesis gas, in view of its ultimateconversion into liquid methanol as a transportation fuel. The systemis capable of gasifying 10 tons/h of sawmill residues. An estimated productionof 35 tons per day of methanol could be produced from this feed rate;the quantity of methanol can reach 210 tons per day if an electrolyser,for oxygen and hydrogen production, is coupled to the gasifier. Evenmore if by-product hydrogen is available to react with all carbon dioxidein the synthesis gas; the production of methanol can be boosted to 310tons per day. Performance operation, and modifications to improve thesystem are described. Repeated anaylses show that the (raw) gas producedeither under air or oxygen gasification, contains solid particulatesand tars. The particulates are detrimental to any industrial and commercialapplication. Extensive studies and investigations indicate that thereare no commerically proven technologies for filtering particulates fromhot gas. It will be necessary for the Biosyn project to develop and/ordemonstrate a hot gas clean-up (HGC) system and tar reforming processto provide a reliable and viable biomass gasification system. 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
