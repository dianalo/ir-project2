For Apple, the connectivity and interoperability issues are lesscritical (though, as we shall see, the company is very aware of them) than isthe goal &quot;to extend the Mac user's world view while retaining the Macintoshexperience.&quot;andM;Apple truly sees computing from the individual out, with individualproductivity as the ultimate goal.andP;  The primary role for the Mac is theuser's window into both his or her own activities and the corporate world.andO;According to Don Casey, Apple vice president of Networking andCommunications, his group's mission statement is to &quot;further empower theMacintosh user by providing electronic access to people and informationaround the multivendor world.&quot;andM;This translates into a vision of die individual at his or her Mac being ableto &quot;(Mac) Reach&quot; data from the outside world, &quot;(Mac) View&quot; the information,and interact with it in the user's normal &quot;(Mac) Way.&quot; (See Chart 1.)andM;Apple defines networking not as simply providing the Mac Reach piece of thevision, but also retaining and building upon the uniqueness of the Macintoshenvironment as embodied in the Mac View and Mac Way concepts.andM;Apple is approaching the implementation of its vision in a number of ways,including the development of a large number of its own networking products,the enhancement of the Macintosh operating system to allow it to better playin a distributed network computing environment, strategic relationships, andthe gaining of key technologies though acquisition.andM;Currently, Apple is concentrating on three areas: bringing the Mac'sconnectivity options up to customer demands, providing a platform fordistributed applications, and setting the stage for the possible emergence ofthe Mac as a player in a distributed peer-to-peer architecture.andO;Connectivity: Catching UpandM;Over the past two years, Apple, along with third parties, has madesignificant inroads into providing connectivity among Macs and between theMacintosh and the rest of the corporate environ ment.andP;  Apple, 3Com, andNovell all support Mac and mixed Mac/PC LANs over both LocalTalk andEthernet.andP;  Connections into the IBM, Digital, and TCP/IP worlds have alsobeen available for some time.andM;Apple sees its current tasks as extending the capabilities of AppleTalk (itsown networking platform), providing an Apple solution to connectivity to fourmajor environments (Digital, IBM, TCP/IP, OSI), and creating tools for usersand developers to integrate communications within the Macintosh environment.andM;This month, Apple is making a series of networking announcements designed tofill in the gaps in its networking line.andP;  New products include an upgrade ofAppleTalk, an Internet Router to bridge various AppleTalk topologies, threenew intelligent communications cards to increase local and wide areaconnectivity options (including the much anticipated token ring board), andnew and enhanced software designed to increase the user's ability to connectthe Mac into the corporate system.andP;  In addition, Apple, in its announcementslast month of the future direction of the Macintosh operating system (System7.0), introduced a Communications Toolbox, which will enable developers toeasily access the new and existing communications functions,andM;APPLETALK PHASE 2.andP;  Apple is committed to AppleTalk as its networkingplatform and plans to extend its capabilities both in terms of connectivityand functionality.andP;  The logic of this commitment can be lost when oneconsiders AppleTalk as the slooooow (less than .25 Mbps)Mac-to-Mac-to-LaserWriter system with which most of us are familiar.andO;However, since its inception, Macintosh networking has been plagued with adefinition problem: the distinction between AppleTalk and LocalTalk.andM;LocalTalk is Apple's proprietary physical medium, which was introduced whenMac networking first began by connecting a couple of Macs to a printer.andO;LocalTalk connects to the network port which comes standard on every Mac andLaserWriter, providing virtually free low-end networking (if you defineprinter-sharing as networking).andP;  LocalTalk is rated at .2304 Mbps, thoughsome vendors have found ways to speed this up to (a claimed) almost 1 Mbps.andO;Apple sees LocalTalk remaining as a low-end solution, and does not find aneed to try to push the speed higher, since other network technologies areavailable to provide the higher throughput.andM;AppleTalk is actually a set of networking protocols that fully map to theInternational Standards Organization (ISO) model (see Chart 2).andP;  It supportsa number of different network technologies at the physical layer, includingEthernet, token ring (third quarter of 1989), and LocalTalk.andP;  Othernetworking vendors, including Digital, Novell, and 3Com (later this year),have or plan to implement the AppleTalk protocols (particularly the AppleFile Protocol, or AFP) on their network servers.andM;Most of the increased functionality will come only to the Ethernet and tokenring versions of AppleTalk, with LocalTalk eventually being (quite properly)relegated to only the smallest workgroup installations.andM;Extending AppleTalk.andM;Apple has evolved AppleTalk from what was essentially a printer-sharingmechanism to a full-fledged system running on Macs, VAXen, and Unixworkstations, and supporting multiple clients including Macs and PCs.andP;  Thecompany's current thrust is to extend die reach of AppleTalk, both literallyand figuratively.andM;AppleTalk Phase 2 will address die limitations of the cuffent version inputting together large networks.andP;  Previously, a single AppleTalk network hada 254-node limit.andP;  Phase 2 extended-addressing will support up to 16 millionnodes, divided into logical zones.andP;  These zones may or may not begeographical in nature.andM;Phase 2 also extends support to token ring technologies for Macs, andsupports PCs on Ethernet or token ring.andM;Users with current Phase 1 AppleTalk installations will be able to mix Phase1 and Phase 2 products without losing Phase 1 functionality.andP;  However, inorder to make use of Phase 2 functions, such as extended-addressing, thewhole network must be upgraded to Phase 2.andP;  Viable mixed networks can beimplemented by using the AppleTalk Internet Router (see below).andM;At this writing, Apple had not released prices or availability for anyAppleTalk Phase 2 products; however, shipments of the products are expectedduring this summer.andP;  AppleTalk Internet Router.andP;  Apple will address a keyelement in providing for larger networking schemes, bridging and routing,with its AppleTalk Internet Router.andP;  The Internet Router is a softwarepackage that runs in the background on any Mac and provides theinternetworking between combinations of LocalTalk, EtherTalk, and TokenTalknetworks.andP;  Each router can interconnect up to eight networks, depending onthe number of available slots, with the internetting of up to 1,024 networkssupported by AppleTalk Phase 2 (see Chart 3).andM;In addition to bridging the various networks, the Internet Router supportsredundant route topologies, enabling rerouting traffic around failures.andP;  TheInternet Router also provides Zone Multicast on EtherTalk and TokenTalknetworks, allowing a message to be sent to a particular (logical or physical)zone only, reducing the overhead caused by broadcasts.andM;The Intemet Router is also important for providing Ethemet and token ringusers access to the LaserWriter, which can only reside on a LocalTalksegment.andM;The Intemet Router collects and displays network statistics and networkactivity (accessed through a desk accessory on the Router Mac).andP;  It will bethe basis for Apple's future moves into network management, and, after Appleopens the Router APIs, third parties will be able to incorporate it intoother network management systems.andM;IBM CONNECTIVITY.andP;  Currently, the largest gaps in Mac connectivity are theconnections to die IBM world.andP;  Recognizing this, Apple last year acquiredOrion Systems, a top independent selling SNA-compatible solutions.andP;  Using thesoftware expertise gained by the Orion acquisition, Apple will be releasingboard-level and software connectivity solutions for Macs into the IBM 3270,SDLC, Token-Ring, and APPC environments.andM;It's in the Cards.andP;  In order to do this, Apple will be releasing three newboards: The Apple TokenTalk NB, the Apple Coax/ Twinax Card, and Apple SerialNB.andP;  The long anticipated TokenTalk NB (NB for NuBus, in other words for theMac II family) supports a variety of networked environments, includingAppleTalk, 3270, APPC, and SMB, permitting users to access LAN and mainframeresources in a number of architectures.andM;The first release of die TokenTalk NB wiU be a 4 Mbps version.andP;  Apple has notannounced a timetable for a 4/16 Mbps or a 16 Mbps version, though itsnetworking people are well aware that die 16 Mbps speeds will be necessaryfor the type of distributed and image-intensive applications we are nowbeginning to see.andP;  We would expect Apple to announce a 16 Mbps product soonafter die 4/16 Mbps chips become widely available.andM;The TokenTalk NB comes with Apple's TokenTalk software (AppleTalk servicesover token ring) and an SMB File Transfer Utility, which allows Mac users totransfer files to and from SMB (Server Message Block) servers, such as theIBM PC LAN Program.andP;  Users can also purchase MacDFT for 3270 emulation and/orMacAPPC, a complete implementation of the SNA LU6.2 protocol, for program-to-program communications services.andM;The Coax/Twinax Card enables Mac IIs to directly connect to an SNA network asa 3270 display terminal.andP;  Apple will provide a 3270 API, based on IBM'sHLLAPI (High-Level Language Application Programming Interface) forapplication programmers to develop Mac-to-mainframe applications.andP;  The Apple3270 API will run with both the Coax/Twinax Card and TokenTalk NB.andM;The Coax/Twinax Card also includes Apple's MacDFT, which allows a single CUT(Control Unit Terminal) emulation or up to five DFT (Distributed FunctionsTerminal) sessions.andP;  It also supports various file transfer formats and canrun in the background under MultiFinder.andM;Apple will also introduce a serial expansion board: die Apple Serial NB Card,which includes four serial ports that can be separately configured forconnectivity to different environments.andP;  When used with MacAPPC software, theSerial NB Card provides a physical- and data-link level SDLC connection intoSNA environments.andM;NEW WIDE AREA SUPPORT.andP;  The Serial NB Card also marks Apple's entrance intothe wide area network (WAN) world, specifically X.25 packet-switchednetworks.andP;  Apple wiU be releasing a single product with two parts thattogether wiU provide access from any node on an AppleTalk network topacketswitched dam communications networks (PSDNs).andM;The first part, MacX25, is server software that enables a single Mac II witha Serial NB Card to act as a single entry point to the PSDN.andP;  The secondpart, MacPAD, running on tile node, provides packet assembler/disassembler(PAD) connectivity to the PSDN.andP;  Implemented as a connection tool for theMacintosh Communications Toolbox (see &quot;Communications Toolbox&quot; below), MacPADallows terminal applications using the toolbox to connect to host systems onthe WAN.andP;  MacX25 has been certified for connection to Telenet and Geisconetworks, with other certifications in the works.andM;COMMUNICATIONS TOOLBOX.andP;  Apple is offering the Macintosh CommunicationsToolbox as an add-on to the current operating system, but as pan of Release7.0, which is due next year.andP;  The toolbox provides developers with standardcommunications services and a consistent user interface for selecting,configuring, and using those services (see Chart 4).andP;  The CommunicationsToolbox includes four &quot;Managers,&quot; each providing a set of APIs for a specificservice:andM;* Connection Manager-data stream/connectionandM;* Terminal Manager-ata presentation/terminal emulationandM;* File Transfer Manager-data transfer/file transferandM;* Communication Resource Manager-central directoryandM;lookup service of available connection servicesandM;The Mac and the Client-Server ModelandM;Given its basic strength (user interface) and Apple's orientafion ofproviding a window into the corporation for individual users, playing therole of client in the client-server model is an obvious course for the Mac.andO;Much work has already gone into creating distributed applications, with theMac providing the graphical front end to host-based applications (usingMacWorkstation or HyperCard).andP;  Using PROFS with a Mac interface is almost apleasurable experience.andM;Later this year, Apple will introduce products that win enhance the Mac'sability to play in a client-server environment.andP;  These include a CL/l Serverfor an IBM host(a server for VAX has already been announced), an X-Windowdisplay server (which makes the X-Window look a lot like the Mac interface),and the availability of the Digital/Apple APIs to developers.andM;DATABASE ACCESS.andP;  Given Apple's view of the individual sitting at the Mac andhaving all of the corporate data available at a mouse click, it is notsurprising that Apple's main focus, in terms of enabling distributedapplications, is database services.andP;  Last year, Apple acquired NetworkInnovations, whose product CL/1 provides connectivity between desktopapplications and host-based databases.andP;  Macintosh applications that supportCL/ I can have transparent access to database managers on die host.andM;In order to do this, the CL/I code has to be received by a CL/I Serverresiding on the database host or the same network as the database.andP;  NetworkInnovations has already announced a CL/I Server for VAX/VMS that will run ondie VAX, giving the user access todatabases through the Digital network.andO;Apple, as pan of its recent networking announcements, also announced CL/Iservers for the IBM host environments, specifically for MVS/TSO and VN/CMSsystems.andM;Apple has also announced that the next generation of the Mac OS (System 7.0)will include an integrated Data Access Manager built upon CL/I.andP;  This wiUenable developers to more easily integrate CL/I by providing standard querymechanisms.andM;Many software developers have committed to CL/I development, includingOracle, ACIUS, Ashton-Tate,lnformix, and Odesta .andM;Oracle Example.andP;  Oracle was one of the first companies to demonstrate the useof the Mac in a distributed environmenL Oracle's architecture (see Chart 5)enables a developer to create the front end of an application in a number ofways: using HyperCard, CL/1, 4th Dimension, or C calls.andP;  The front end canaccess data from the local Oracle database on the Mac or, via SQL*Net,anywhere on the network.andP;  The front end can be as Mac-like as the developerdesires (for example, regional reports being generated by pointing andclicking on maps).andM;This client-server model fits in exactly with Apple's Macintosh Vision.andP;  Theuser has access to both his or her local data and the corporate data,seamlessly moving between the two.andP;  Digital, as well, supports this viewunder its NAS (Network Application Support-which provides support for avariety of clients including VMS, Unix, DOS, and Mac).andP;  The Mu as the frontend is the perfect fit for die VAX on the back endhence, the ease with whichApple and Digital can work together to put the pieces in place to promotethis environment.andM;MacX.andP;  MacX, a Macintosh operating system implementation of X-Window Version11 Release 3 display software, is designed to allow the Mac to play in anX-Window environment such as DECwindows.andP;  The Mac becomes a display server(note the reversal of client and server imposed by X terminology) for anX-compliant client application running on a host (see Chart 6).andP;  MacX willoperate atop AppleTalk, TCP/IP, and DECnet.andM;Under MultiFinder, the Mac can support a number of windows, mixed and matchedbetween X-Windows and Mac windows.andP;  The user can cut and paste text orgraphics between applications in any open window via the Mac Clipboard.andM;Keeping to its Mac Vision model and avoiding the user interface issuesassociated with X (OpenView vs.andP;  Motif), Apple has designed MacX windows tolook and feel as much like die Mac window as possible (moving, resizing,shrinking windows to icons), though there still are some distinctions, suchas where the menu bar goes.andP;  Apple-Digital: The Special RelationshipandM;List month, at Apple's Worldwide Developers' Conference, Apple and Digitaljointly delivered to developers the first sets of APIs resulting from theApple-Digital codevelopment agreement of last year.andP;  Under this agreement,Apple and Digital committed to provide a variety of products and tools toenable Macintosh applications to share information, computing power, andnetwork resources with VMS systems.andM;Specifically, the capabilities planned under the AppleDigital agreement are:andM;* File- and print-sharing between Macintosh and VMS usersandM;* Tools for Macintosh access to VMS databasesandM;* Tools that allow a Macintosh distributed user interface forandM;VMS-based applicationsandM;* Interprocess communication between Macintosh and VMSandM;systemsandM;*Compound document translation between Digital andandM;Macintosh formatsandM;* Communications facilities based on electronic messagingandM;* Comprehensive system and network management toolsandM;APPLETALK FOR VMS.andP;  File- and print-sharing wiU be implemented underAppleTalk for VMS, a VMS implementation that turns the VAX into an AppleTalknode (see VAX server diagram in Chart 7).andM;The VAX Server will provide applications and services to Macs throughAppleTalk, while, at the same time, providing a software gateway to DECnetservices (see Chart 8).andM;The gateway provides Mac applications with the ability to use the AppleTalkData Stream Protocol (ADSP) to communicate with applications that useDigital's Network Service Protocols (NSP).andP;  It also allows the VAX to run asa bridge (DECnet Tunneling, according to Apple), internetting remoteAppleTalk networks, and allowing, for example, a Mac user on one AppleTalknetwork to use his or her Chooser to select a LaserWriter on anotherAppleTalk network.andM;From the Mac, the AppleTalk/DECnet gateway maintains the &quot;Macness&quot; usersexpect; it looks Eke any oflier service on the AppleTalk internet, as thegateway registers its name on the internet in much the same way thatAppleShare servers or LaserWriters register their names.andM;File and Print Services.andP;  The VAX Server, by implementing the Apple FileProtocol (AFP), provides Mac and VAX users the ability to share files.andP;  Thisis done by mapping the Macintosh Hierarchical File Structure (HFS) into theVMS file structure by equating Macintosh volumes and folder with VMSdirectories, an Macintosh data and resource forks with VMS files.andP;  The systemenables Mac users to see VMS files as any other Mac File, and VMS users tosee Mac files as VMS files.andM;Common print services will be available to both Mac and VMS users, withspooling support to Digital PostScript printers (PrintServer 40 andScriptPrinter) on the VAX and Apple LaserWriters on AppleTalk.andM;DATABASE ACCESS.andP;  Distributed applications will be able to take advantage ofdatabases located on the VAX via the CL/I Server for VMS, which will map CL/1calls to the databases resident on the VAX such as Rdb/VMs, Sybase, Ingres,etc.andP;  Digital, as part of its overall support for distributed databaseaccess, will be offering VAX SQL Services For Macintosh that enable frontends, such as dBase IV or any other application written to the SQL servicesAPI, to access Rdb/VMS (See Chart 9).andM;DISTRIBUTED INTERFACE.andP;  Digital has committed to a distributed architecturefor interface across all of its platforms.andP;  The specific implementation willbe DECwindows, an interface based on the X-Window standard.andP;  This willeventually be migrated to the Open Software Foundation's (OSF's) Motif.andM;Apple's MacX X-Window display server (see &quot;MacX&quot; above) is designed to allowthe Mac to operate in Digital's distributed display environment as a server(note again that, in &quot;XWindow Speak,&quot; clients are servers and servers areclients).andP;  Neither Apple nor Digital see the Mac playing the role of X client(running as an application server), except for a Mac running A/UX.andM;MacX, though a full implementation of X 11 V.3 (with some V.4 features), doesnot implement all of the DECwindows extensions.andP;  (According to Apple, neitherdoes Digital's current PC-based implementation.)andM;Apple has also announced plans to incorporate Digital's proprietary LocalArea Transpon (LAT) terminal services technology in the CommunicationsToolbox.andP;  LAT will support Ethemet-based, multisession terminal emulation onthe Mac.andP;  INTERPROCESS COMMUMCATIONS.andP;  Digital is anxious to bringprogram-to-program communications to the Mac/VAX environment.andP;  One of theways in which the company plans to implement this is to supply a Maccomponent of a common Remote Procedure Call (RPC) mechanism-Digital haslicensed NCS from Apollo, so this would be die logical one.andP;  Digital'scuffent plans include die Mac as a client-only implementation, with theability to call files and procedures from other processors on the network,but not to supply diem.andM;Other possibilities for cooperative processing would be to implement OS/2 LANManager Named Pipes and Mailslots APIs from the Mac, something that we expect3Com and/or Hewleu-Packard to do.andM;COMPOUND DOCUMENTS.andP;  Apple and Digital will provide a mechanism for invokingcompound document converters adherent to Digital's CDA (Compound DocumentArchitecture) that translate to and from DDIF (Digital Document InterchangeFormat) and standard Mac file formats, including MacWrite, PICT, etc.andP;  (seeChart 10).andM;COMMUNICATIONS FACILTIES.andP;  The Apple/Digital agreement includes three typesof communications facilities to be shared between the environments:electronic mail, videotex.andP;  and conferencing.andM;Though final plans have not yet been released, the companies are committed tomail interchange via X.400, and participation by the Mac user in Digital'svideotex (VAX VTX) and conferencing (VAX Notes) systems.andM;NETWORK MANAGEMENT.andP;  The management goals of the Apple/Digital agreement areto be able to:andM;* View DECnet networks with AppleTalk network manageandM;ment toolsandM;* View AppleTalk networks with DECnet network manageandM;ment toolsandM;* Pass event messages from the network management tools ofandM;AppleTalk to those of DECnetandM;* Monitor and control the components of AppleTalk for VMSandM;and the AppleTalk/DECnet transport gatewayandM;These goals will be achieved through a management gateway, which will be panof AppleTalk for VMS for which Apple will release the APIs.andP;  Peer-to-PeerDistributed Network ComputingandM;There is another model of distributed computing.andP;  This view, best exemplifiedby Apollo's Network Computing System (NCS), holds that the networkingarchitecture should be flexible enough to permit workstations to run asclients or as servers.andP;  Servers, in this sense, can be file or data servers,or they can be compute servers, thus allowing the network to grab unusedcycles ftom less busy or idle machines.andP;  This also allows the dynamicassignment of processes to the freest processor or the one most appropriateto run a specific application.andM;For example, let's take another look at the picture of Oracle's architecture(see Chart 5).andP;  The user at the Mac has transparent access w both the localdata on the Mac and all data on the network.andP;  But how can the data on his orher Mac be accessed by other users? The answff is, they can't.andP;  The Mac,while a fine client in this environment, cannot wt as a server.andM;Or perhaps I am sitting at a VMS, DOS, or Unix workstation and would like torun an application that runs best (or only) on the Mac.andP;  With Apple'simplementation of the client-server architecture, the Mac can initiate aprocess on the VMS or Unix server (DOS is also generally implemented asclient-only); -however, the reverse is not currently possible.andM;While we certainly agree that the predominant architecture will beclient-server with the Mac as client, it is important that the architecturebe flexible enough to support the best configuration for the organization.andO;The judgment of who is to be a client and who is to be a server (andparticularly who is to be both) should be an organizational judgment, not anarchitectural limitation.andM;This distinction cuts right to heart of the Apple Vision.andP;  Is the computingsystem designed to empower die individual, to put the corporate informationand services at his or her disposal? Or is the system designed to enhance theeffectiveness of the organization as a whole? (And, of course, are thesecontradictory positions, or simply different emphases?)andM;Clearly, Apple has come down on the side of the individual.andP;  The company seesits job as furthering the individual's Mac experience, making theorganization more effective by making the individual more productive.andO;Apple's implementation thrust is for the Mac predominantly as the client,from which the user can access data from anywhere across the network.andP;  Thus,few of Apple's latest network thrusts support the Mac as a server in adistributed environment.andM;SYSTEM 7.0: A RAY OF HOPE FOR THE MAC AS PEER? While this attitude does notseem likely to change, Apple, with its new operating system-7.0-is putting inplace the pieces that may enable the Mac to participate in DNC as both aclient and a server.andM;Under the new OS (which contains, among other things, virtual memory,scalable screen fonts, and Live Copy/Pastelive links between local ornetworked applications), Apple will further the Mac architecture by addingsupport for applications to exchange commands, thus allowing one applicationto &quot;control&quot; another, i.e., have the application query its database and sendback an answer.andP;  Conceptually, applications will have aB the abilities(vis-a-vis other applications) that a user has with a mouse and keyboard.andM;These commands or messages are called Apple Events, and they will be underthe control of the Event Manager.andP;  Apple plans to work with developers todefine a standard set of events, initially around the most common commands,such as Open, Print, Copy, Paste, etc.andP;  Then the company plans to meet withrepresentatives of developers of specific application typesword processing,spreadsheet, database, graphics, etc.-and define extensions to the standardset for each specific area.andM;As with the Live Copy/Paste, Apple Events will operate either locally or overthe network.andP;  The ability for interapplication communication across thenetwork will be one of the key factors enabling distributing applicationsonto the Macintosh platform.andP;  Because the Interapplication CommunicationsArchitecture (IAC) is layered and all of the functions are built on a commonProgram-to-Program Communications (PPC) mechanism, it is possible for thisdistributed computing to occur in a multivendor environment if the PPC ismapped to a standard RPC mechanism (see Chart 11).andM;While this is not Apple's original intent, it certainly is not lost on thosecompanies that, for instance, are planning to implement NCS RPCs.andP;  This iscertainly one area which will bear watching.andM;What Is to Be Done?andM;When we first decided to revisit Macintosh networking after two years, weposed these questions: Can the Mac play in a distributed network computingenvironment? Is Apple taking a leadership role in moving the Mac into the newarchitectures?andM;We have found the answers to be yes and yes, with two qualifications.andM;First, there is still much work to be done, both by Apple and others,particularly in the areas of TCP/IP and OSI connecfivity, integrated networkmanagement, and peer-to-peer capabilities.andP;  We have pined some confidenceftom this study that at least the first two priorities will be addressed byApple along with its development planners in the near future, and that thethird will be embodied in products from other vendors if Apple decides not toplay.andM;Second is our overall concern with Apple's vision.andP;  This vision has takenApple quite a distance in its networking offerings, but we feel that it may,in some ways, be a limiting factor in the evolution of network-based,group-oriented products.andP;  Mac users seem to have been much slower than PCusers to implement and accept group-oriented services.andM;Specifically, enecLronic mail, a staple of the PC LAN and host-based system,has only recently begun to penetrate Nu networks.andP;  And other networkservices, such as group calendar and scheduling, which have been available onthe PC LAN for a number of years, have yet to find their way to Mac users.andM;Is this because of the difficulty of implementing these products on the Macor because of a lack of interest on the pan of Mac users due to their&quot;individualistic&quot; orientation? Or is it a chicken-and-egg proposition ofdevelopers holding back development dollars because of lack of interest andlack of interest due to lack of products? Whatever the reason, we fear thatdie Mac will be slow to play in the group environment without some leadershipfrom Apple pushing group solutions or at least the Mac as a platform forgroup-oriented applications.andM;In spite of these concerns, we leave Macintosh networking impressed withApple's vision and plans for implementing it.andP;  We are assured not only thatthe Mac can play, but that it will be a player.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
