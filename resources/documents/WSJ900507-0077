Adding the shows would have forced Fox -- whichis set to reap a fortune on sales of reruns of TV series madeby its own studio -- to follow the same rules that havebarred ABC, CBS and NBC from the rerun business for twodecades.   Now the Federal Communications Commission has ruled thatFox can add the new programming without the risk oftriggering the rerun restrictions, known as the FinancialInterest and Syndication Rules, or &quot;fin-syn.&quot; It is a blow toFox's three bigger rivals, which have lost a sizable share ofthe prime-time audience to the upstart and had opposed Fox'srequest for a temporary waiver of the FCC rules.   &quot;It's incredibly important for us. Obviously, we'redelighted,&quot; says Jamie Kellner, president of FoxBroadcasting, the network entity of Fox Inc. that is owned byNews Corp. While the Big Three networks can't syndicateshows, Fox takes in more than $25 million a year in sellingthe tabloid-news show &quot;A Current Affair&quot; to local stations.Fox stands to reap a far larger fortune a few years hence onreruns of &quot;L.A. Law,&quot; which its studio makes for the NBCnetwork, and on reruns of the Fox network's screwy newcartoon hit, &quot;The Simpsons,&quot; which Fox also owns.   But network officials believe the latest action signalsthat the FCC will take a dim view of the burdensome fin-synrules when it begins a major review next month of whether tolift the regulations. The networks are in stalled talks withHollywood studios -- which take in hundreds of millions ofdollars in rerun profits thanks to the rules -- to try tocraft a compromise for easing the network restrictions.   &quot;The commission obviously now is wrestling with thereality that these rules do impose restrictions on networkswhich are difficult to justify in today's world,&quot; saysStephen A. Weiswasser, general counsel at Capital Cities/ABCInc., which owns the ABC network. At the very least, the FCCmove may strengthen the networks' hand in the talks with thestudios.   A spokesman for NBC, a unit of General Electric Co.,echoed those hopes. But NBC criticized the FCC ruling asgiving Fox an unfair edge and as an impediment to efforts toease the rerun provisions. &quot;Granting special treatment forFox is unfair and counterproductive to the current round ofnegotiations,&quot; the NBC spokesman said. &quot;It removes theimmediate pressure on Fox and the studios to reach asettlement.&quot;   The FCC, which approved the Fox waiver 4-0, tried to bluntspeculation by stressing its ruling &quot;in no way prejudges orforeshadows&quot; how it will rule on whether to lift theregulations. But an FCC official said privately that thewaiver shows the commission's determination to spurcompetition with the Big Three networks -- and a willingnessto grant them greater leeway in syndication. The officialasked, &quot;Having given something to {Fox}, how can we not giveit&quot; to the major networks?   The FCC waiver gives Fox, now airing nine hours ofprogramming each week, the freedom to go up to 18 1/2 hoursof shows without having to follow the rerun rules. (FCCregulations define a network as any service airing more than15 hours a week, and Fox had sought a waiver from the 15-hourcap.) In return, Fox vows to forgo acquiring an ownershipstake in programs supplied by other studios, since the rulesprohibit the networks from taking such a stake.   The FCC's waiver, however, is so limited that Fox may yethave to side with the Big Three networks and against its ownstudio siblings in the rerun battle. The waiver won't let Foxgo beyond 18 1/2 hours, and it lasts for only a year. If theFCC hasn't resolved the fin-syn debate in a year, Fox wouldhave to scale back its program lineup to fall under the15-hour cap -- or withdraw from the rerun businessaltogether.   Generally, the studios in the rerun fight have appealed tomembers of Congress, who are big beneficiaries of Hollywood'scampaign contributions. But such influential lawmakers asHouse Commerce Committee Chairman John Dingell (D., Mich.)have said they back the FCC in its efforts to resolve theissue. Now the FCC may be tilting away from Hollywood andtoward the broadcasters.</TEXT></DOC>
