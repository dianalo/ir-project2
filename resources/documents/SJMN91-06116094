But to hear some people talk, neverhave so many been thanked for so little.;    &quot;It's inappropriate andincorrect. She didn't interview me,&quot; said an annoyed Lou Cannon of theWashington Post, one of more than 100 editors, writers and reporters acrossthe country &quot;who took the time to answer questions and share their stories,&quot;according to Kelley in the preface to her book, &quot;Nancy Reagan: TheUnauthorized Biography.&quot;  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  NOT EVERYONE'S HAPPY TO BE ON KELLEY'S LIST  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     Jack Nelson, Washington bureau chief for the Los Angeles Times, said ontelevision recently that he had not helped Kelley, despite being thanked inthe book. Since then, Nelson said, Kelley sent him a letter explaining she wasgrateful because he had allowed one of her researchers to use the Times' newslibrary.;    While Kelley may have gleaned some of the juiciest literarytidbits from people who would never or could never admit it, some of the folksshe acknowledged say they did nothing more than make fruitless phone calls.;   Audrey Adler Wolf, a Washington literary agent, says Kelley &quot;asked me to puther in touch with one of my clients.&quot; Wolf said she called the client threetimes, but he refused to talk to Kelley. Yet there's her name in theacknowledgements -- seventh from the end.;    One Washington insider saidKelley asked him to get political consultant Ed Rollins to return her calls,but Rollins refused. The insider was thanked by name anyway in Kelley'sacknowledgments -- and so was Rollins.;    Kelley, who claims she interviewedmore than 1,000 people over four years to complete the book, was in Englandpromoting her work and couldn't be reached for an interview this week.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910425  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  3A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  295  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday April 25, 199100116094,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
