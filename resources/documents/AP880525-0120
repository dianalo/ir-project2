Meeting in a closed-door caucus, party members approved aresolution stating that the current delivery system _ whichincludes a carrier with past ties to the CIA _ violates atwo-month-old cease-fire agreement and the legislation thatprovided $17.7 million in humanitarian aid.   The resolution called on the administration to ``make immediatearrangements for delivery of aid through the Pan-AmericanDevelopment Foundation,'' an OAS arm that has been deemedacceptable to both the rebels and the Sandinista government inpublic statements.   The State Department's Agency for International Development,which is administering the aid program, has so far delivered 600metric tons of food, clothing and other supplies to rebel forcesinside Honduras through other private contractors, said AIDspokesman Roger Noriega.   The loads delivered so far have been inspected byrepresentatives of the Catholic church in Honduras to make surethey contain no lethal supplies, Noriega said. Most of thedeliveries have been made by truck, although there have been abouta dozen airdrops, he said.   AID also plans to begin this week purchasing cordobas, theNicaraguan currency, for distribution to rebel troops in the fieldas early as next week, Noriega added. Troops will receive about $1a day each, he said.   Noriega said AID could not begin to make delivery arrangementswith the foundation, as the Democrats requested, because it had noformal notification that the organization is acceptable to bothsides.   ``There has to be a formal agreement in place,'' he said. ``Wehave said all along that the neutral delivery mechanism has to bepart of an agreement between the resistance and the Sandinistagovernment.''   He added: ``It is wholly unrealistic to expect AID to talk withthe PADF in specific terms until there is a signed agreement orsome kind of reliable public statement.''</TEXT></DOC>
