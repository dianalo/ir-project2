But now that thousands of Soviets are being letout, many are finding the doors to the United States closed.   Some 19,000 Soviets are waiting to be interviewed at the U.S.Embassy in Moscow for permission to enter the United States asrefugees; another 7,000 are waiting in temporary quarters nearRome, according to State Department figures.   The steadily growing backlog appears to result from severalfactors: poor planning by the administration, severe budgetrestraints and a change in the Justice Department's refugee policy.   ``Now that the Soviet Union has chosen to let these people go,we must not fail them,'' said Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif., who hassponsored one of several proposed funding bills to ease theemergency.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The National Rifle Association, traditionalheart, soul and bankroll of the nation's gun lobby, is digging infor a test of its vaunted political power amid rising pressure tocurb sales of assault weapons.   ``When less than half the convicted felons ever spend a day injail, why should we be taking firearms away from law-abidingpeople?'' declares James Jay Baker, federal affairs director forthe 118-year old NRA.   Demands for restrictions on military-style, semiautomaticfirearms are escalating, however, in the aftermath of the Stockton,Calif., schoolyard tragedy Jan. 17 in which a deranged gunman withan assault rifle left five youngsters dead and 30 other personsinjured.   So intense is the clamor that, as often as the NRA has crushedor blunted gun control bills in the past, many doubt that it canprevail this time with its strategy of blaming the murder wavesweeping cocaine-ridden communities not on firearms but ``ourcrumbling criminal justice system.''</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   To Sen. Robert C. Byrd, the United StatesSenate over the last 200 years has been a rock-bound channel, ableto contain the onrushing passions of the moment without losing itsessential and original shape and purpose.   Byrd, in what he calls a ``labor of love,'' has pursued thattheme in a seven-pound history of the institution as it developedover the past two centuries.   The book, called ``The Senate _ 1789-1989'' and availablethrough the Government Printing Office, is a lavishly illustratedand meticulous account based on 42 of the 100 speeches Byrddelivered on the floor of the Senate in an unprecedented seriesthat began in 1980.</TEXT><DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Computer games,three-dimensional maps and nature trails are being developed tohelp visitors understand how last year's forest fires were actuallyuseful.   Space-age techniques went into the production of some of theinterpretive projects, which were considered nine months ago whenfires began consuming what would eventually consume nearly half ofthe 2.2 million-acre park.   ``Around the first of July we began to realize that we were notonly confronted with an incredible history-making event in terms offire suppression, but with a virtually unprecedented educationalopportunity as well,'' said George Robinson, Yellowstone's chiefnaturalist.   Forestry officials say the fires prompt rebirth in thewilderness, clearing away the old, dead and overgrown while makingway for new vegetation and new wildlife habitats.</TEXT></DOC>
