Gates told a Senate Judiciary subcommittee Friday asit opened hearings on assault rifles.   The hearing spotlighted a bill being sponsored by Sen. Howard M.Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, that would ban the sale of AK-47s, Uzis andother military-style, semiautomatic rifles as well as shotgunsequipped with drum magazines that can fire 12 blasts in threeseconds.   Sgt. William Pattison, a Nassau County, N.Y., policeman andexecutive vice president of the National Association of PoliceOrganizations, had a blunt message for the committee.   ``Our streets are becoming a combat zone,'' he said. ``Prompt anddecisive action by Congress is needed.''   On display was an arsenal of grease guns and semiautomaticpistols as well as such standbys as the semiautomatic adaptation ofthe AK47, long the basic weapon of Communist infantrymen fromVietnam to Afghanistan.   Patrick Edward Purdy used an AK47 on Jan. 17 when he opened fireon 400 children on a playground outside the Cleveland ElementarySchool in Stockton, Calif.   Five children died and 29 children were injured as well as oneteacher.   The hearing fell silent as Lori Mackey, a teacher at the Stocktonschool, told how she and her pupils huddled on their classroom floorwhile shots crackled across the schoolyard and the shadow of thegunman crossed back and forth across their window.   ``We hoped that he would not notice that we were there and thathe would maybe think that we were at recess too,'' she said.   Since then, she said, nightmares and fear of strangers haveplagued her pupils. She said she has become distrustful and wincesat unexpected sounds.   Metzenbaum's bill is being opposed by gun groups on grounds thatit would outlaw not only so-called assault rifles but alsotraditional hunting rifles with a semiautomatic capacity.   In fact, there is no functional difference between the two,testified Edward Conroy, acting deputy associate director for lawenforcement of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.   Gates scoffed at the notion that there was no way to outlawassault rifles without also banning the guns of legitimate hunters.   ``It seems to me that we're smart enough to do it,'' he said.   ``I can tell you (the difference) because I've had two policeofficers killed with assault weapons,'' Gates said.   ``Gang members love these weapons because in their drive-byshootings they don't have to be marksmen, they don't have to besportsmen, all they have to do is spray,'' the chief said.   Metzenbaum said the California episode showed that the AK-47 wasnot meant for use ``in a duck blind.''   ``We know of only one instance in which this was used forhunting,'' he said. ``When a psychopath in California went huntingschool children.''   Representatives of some of the nation's gun-owner groups arguedthat firearms themselves are not the problem.   The Stockton incident ``reflects a breakdown in the criminaljustice system,'' said John M. Snyder, public affairs director ofthe Washington-based Citizens Committee to Keep and Bear Arms.   He urged tougher laws to keep guns out of the hands of criminals.   National Rifle Association lobbyist James Jay Baker saidMetzenbaum's bill conflicted with the Second Amendment to theConstitution, guaranteeing citizens the right to keep and bear arms.   ``It is just the kind of ill-considered legislation that theSecond Amendment was designed to prevent,'' he told Metzenbaum.</TEXT></DOC>
