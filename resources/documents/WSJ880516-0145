The finding, made by researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, elucidates the cellular machinery for making proteins, the main constituents of living things. The machinery involved in the discovery affects a wide range of vital processes in cells -- so wide, in fact, that using it in a selective way to make drugs or treat diseases may prove difficult, scientists said.    The finding &quot;contributes a significant component to the body of knowledge&quot; about how cells work, said Paul Schimmel, an MIT researcher who made the discovery with colleague Ya-Ming Hou. &quot;I can't say that I can point to a problem that it can be applied to. But often we can't foresee applications&quot; for fundamental discoveries.    The discovery, reported in last Friday's issue of the journal Nature, concerns the process by which the information contained in DNA is translated into proteins. Scientists have long known that proteins are made via a process in which genetic information, embodied in the molecular sequences of DNA's building blocks, is copied onto molecules called messenger RNA. Still other intermediary molecules, called transfer RNA, translate the information from messenger RNA into proteins, long chains of small molecules called amino acids.    Researchers also have known that different kinds of transfer RNA, each carrying one of 20 different amino acids, assemble the acids in chains whose sequences are specified by messenger RNA. Before the MIT discovery, however, they didn't know how different forms of transfer RNA pick up specific amino acids for assembling into proteins.    The MIT discovery shows that a certain small portion of a particular kind of transfer RNA makes it stick to a particular amino acid, called alanine. Mr. Schimmel said future research is expected to disclose a family of similar small pieces of transfer RNA that serve as codes for identifying and sticking to each kind of amino acid.    By analogy with genetic engineering -- which involves manipulation of pieces of DNA to produce desired proteins -- applications from the MIT finding would probably involve manipulation of transfer RNA. But changes in transfer RNA molecules would transform every protein manufactured in a cell -- with potentially drastic effects like those on an automated assembly line if all the welding machines were replaced with saws. Even small defects in a cell's transfer RNA system can kill it, Mr. Schimmel said.    Thus, while hailing the MIT discovery as an exciting fundamental finding, most scientists have trouble -- at least, at first glance -- thinking of practical uses for it.    The finding concerns &quot;such generalized effects in a cell that it won't be easy to target it for specific things,&quot; said Patricia Olson, research manager at Chiron Corp., an Emeryville, Calif.-based biotechnology concern. Patrick Gage, a vice president and research manager at Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., a U.S. unit of F. Hoffmann-La Roche andamp; Co. of Switzerland, added that researchers already have the tools to make small, selective changes in proteins by synthetically replacing their amino acids. &quot;Unless I'm missing something, I don't see how we can take advantage&quot; of the MIT finding, he added.    The finding, however, might be applied in cancer research, said Alexander Rich, an MIT scientist who earlier helped identify the structure of transfer RNA but wasn't involved in the latest discovery. &quot;In principle,&quot; he said, medicines could be devised that would slightly alter transfer RNA processes, interfering with production of cellular proteins. That, in turn, might kill fast-growing cancer cells but not normal ones.    And Paul Horn, an International Business Machines Corp. research manager, said that the MIT discovery might someday provide insight on correcting errors in transmission of data between computers. He explained that because transfer RNA transmits information, it must contain a mechanism for ensuring that errors in transmission are corrected. &quot;Understanding how nature does that may help you do that in computing,&quot; he added.    ---   Michael Waldholz and Paul B.
