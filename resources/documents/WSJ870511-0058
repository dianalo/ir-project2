The sources said each country will substantially raise the number of its military ships in the gulf to guard merchant ships from Iranian assaults. The Soviets recently had said that they would provide escorts for their ships if it became necessary. And for several months the U.S. has informally provided escorts for merchant ships in the gulf, but the U.S. Navy has been reluctant to provide such service permanently.    In a separate effort, U.S. Energy Secretary John Herrington said the U.S. has agreed to register 21 Kuwaiti ships under its flag in an effort to protect them from attack.    The sources said the U.S. and the Soviets have separately concluded that it is necessary to try to check what one senior Arab cabinet minister called &quot;the mood of rising adventurism&quot; of Iran's navy in the Persian Gulf following Iran's attack last week on a Soviet freighter sailing near the Arab emirate of Dubai. A U.S. Navy spokesman said the Soviets have four military ships operating in or near the gulf, while the U.S. has 14 such ships.    The Soviet and U.S. moves reflect a growing concern over Iran's new show of power in the region. Earlier this year, Iran mounted several surface-to-surface missile attacks on the shores of the gulf and on the Iraqi port of Fao, directly threatening ports in nearby Kuwait. In addition, Arab sources said, Iran has established several footholds in the northern part of Iraq during the past few weeks.    &quot;Iran's willingness to fire on a Soviet ship was very foolish on their part,&quot; said a senior U.S. administration official, who asked not to be identified. &quot;There is a desire to check this&quot; by both superpowers. He added: &quot;There will be more escorts in the gulf and we will obviously defend those ships carrying (the U.S.) flag.&quot;    Mr. Herrington's statement that 21 Kuwaiti ships will register under the U.S. flag indicates the interest the U.S. has in securing the freedom of navigation in the gulf, especially since U.S. dependence on oil from the region is expected to increase during the next few years.    &quot;This is born out of necessity,&quot; said Mr. Herrington, who was in Paris for today's ministerial meeting of the International Energy Agency. &quot;Kuwait asked us and we responded in the same spirit, which is to ensure stability of supply and the relationship with the (Arab oil producers) for the future.&quot;    Asked what the U.S. would do if Iran fires on Kuwaiti ships raising the U.S. flag, Mr. Herrington said: &quot;It's a longstanding position in the U.S. that you don't want to go into what our options are. It is better to let them guess.&quot;    Mr. Herrington said these developments come as the U.S. relationship with the gulf's major oil producers is improving. One reason for that is the perceived danger of an Iranian military victory in its war with Iraq.    The U.S. has backed away from its policy of &quot;OPEC bashing&quot; and is backing Saudi Arabia's quest to achieve oil-price stability, Mr. Herrington said. &quot;I don't look for $9 (a barrel) oil again,&quot; Mr. Herrington said. &quot;We realize we've all been through a wrenching experience internationally and within the U.S. Everybody sees the down side and we all agree it is not beneficial&quot; to go through radical swings in prices, he said.    Mr. Herrington said Saudi Oil Minister Hisham Nazer, who visited the U.S. in April, found Washington receptive to his argument in favor of stable prices. The U.S. said it wouldn't quarrel with Saudi Arabia's goal of setting oil prices at $18 a barrel -- or a little higher -- and would end its aggressive campaign against the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, according to senior U.S. industry and government sources.    Mr. Herrington said that because of Mr. Nazer's visit and recent intensive contacts between the Arab oil producers and the U.S., &quot;relations are excellent and they will get better. There is an overall realization of the need for stability in the gulf.&quot;    Behind this concern is the fact, according to a recent Energy Department study, that the U.S. will double its oil imports to nearly 10 million barrels a day by 1995 and that &quot;the free world will depend on the gulf for 65% of its oil by then.&quot; Mr. Herrington noted.    Last week President Reagan said the U.S., which already holds about 530 million barrels of oil in its Strategic Petroleum Reserve, will boost the filling rate from 35,000 barrels a day to 100,000 barrels a day because of recent developments in the gulf. </TEXT></DOC>
