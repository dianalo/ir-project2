The stationary end plate is connected to the      clamping plate by a toggle mechanism having a double toggle lever. The      double toggle lever is actuatable by at least two drive units arranged      between the end plate and the mold clamping plate, parallel to a main axis      of the machine. </PAL></ABST><BSUM> <PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The present invention relates to a device for closing molds of an injection      molding machine for plastic and, more particularly, to such a mold closing      device having a stationary end plate that is connected to a mold clamping      plate which is moveable on traverses via a toggle lever mechanism having a      double toggle lever. </PAR><PAR>  During injection molding of plastic, mold halves are moved towards and away      from each other during pauses in the cycle between casting and ejection of      the cast article. For this purpose, a moveable mold clamping plate is      displaced on traverses. This moveable clamping plate can be actuated      directly by drive units or by a toggle mechanism. </PAR><PAR>  An exclusively hydraulic embodiment has the disadvantage that, as a whole,      one or more piston-cylinder units designed for relatively high pressures      are necessary. In addition, the hydraulic pressure in this completely      hydraulic machine must be retained when the machine is locked. </PAR><PAR>  From EP-PS 01 64 419, a closing device for closing molds of an injection      molding system is known in which a link mechanism is moveable by a spindle      nut that is driven by a servo motor. Such embodiment has the disadvantage      that the drive motor as well as the spindle nut protrude considerably in      all embodiments described in the patent. The interference with the space      between end plate and moveable clamping plate specifically upon a      non-concentric arrangement is also disadvantageous. </PAR><PAR>  From Federal Republic of Germany Patent 29 09 738 a form-locking device for      injection molding machines for injection-compression molding of plastic      parts is known in which a centrally arranged cylinder of a piston-cylinder      unit has a stop at its end, the stop being adjustable in accordance with a      compression stroke. The injection molding machine of the mentioned patent      takes up a large amount of space due to the cylinder which extends out of      the machine plus the adjusting device. By the central arrangement of the      piston-cylinder unit, furthermore, the space between the end plate and the      moveable mold clamping plate in the center is filled up. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  An object of the present invention is to provide a mold closing unit which,      with simple means, (i) reduces the required set-up space of an injection      molding machine of this type and (ii) permits a substantially unimpeded      installation space in the region of the side of the clamping plate facing      the end plate. </PAR><PAR>  The foregoing object of the invention is achieved by a device for closing      molds of an injection molding machine for plastic. The device includes a      stationary end plate and a mold clamping plate displaceable on traverses.      The stationary end plate is connected to the clamping plate by a toggle      mechanism having a double toggle lever. The double toggle lever is      actuatable by at least two drive units arranged between the end plate and      the mold clamping plate, parallel to a main axis of the machine. </PAR><PAR>  At least two drive units are employed in the device of the invention for      closing molds of an injection molding machine for plastic. By the use of      double toggle levers, drives for a relatively low pressure level with      small outside dimensions are used. By the provision of such drives between      the end plate and the movable mold clamping plate, no drive parts extend      beyond the main parts of the injection molding machine. Valuable shop      space is not wasted; due to their protected arrangement, the drive parts      are no longer as strongly endangered by damage due, for instance, to crane      operations. By the elimination of impact and stumbling edges, safety on      the job is increased. </PAR><PAR>  By the provision of at least two drives, there is the possibility of      keeping the region around the main axis of the machine free of disturbing      machine parts. This free central space can be used for mounting, measuring      and control purposes as well as for monitoring. </PAR><PAR>  The construction of the injection molding machine of the invention is      independent of the type of drive used. As a drive unit, hydraulic      piston-cylinder units can be used, in the form of both differential and      synchronous cylinders, as well as a ball screw. When synchronous cylinders      are used, one can make use of the advantage that only a constant volume of      oil is to be moved, both upon the closing phase and upon the opening      phase. Servo-synchronous cylinders can advantageously be employed.      Furthermore, the double toggle lever is guided by an attachment of the      piston rod of the synchronous cylinder at both ends. </PAR><PAR>  In another embodiment, the cylinder of the piston-cylinder unit is      developed and guided as a travel surface. In a third embodiment, traverses      are used as guide elements. Such types of guidance impart high rigidity to      the compact injection molding machine. </PAR><PAR>  The free space in the center of the injection molding machine is further      increased by a crosshead developed in framework construction. This light      construction of the crosshead, which is torsionally rigid when suitably      designed, makes it possible, together with one of the above-indicated      types of guidance, to effect a precise, disturbance-free introduction of      the forces from the drives into the double toggle levers. </PAR><PAR>  Without constricting the free space and without enlarging the outside      dimensions of the injection molding machine, mechanical stops can be      arranged at the foot of the drives. In this way, the toggle-lever system      can be precisely adjusted. Furthermore, shock absorbers which minimize      impact forces can also be provided on the stops. By these measures the      life of individual parts of the injection molding machine is positively      affected without limiting the ease of operation and maintenance resulting      from the free space created. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  Embodiments of the machine of the invention are shown in the accompanying      drawing, in which: </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a diagrammatic view in perspective, showing a preferred      construction of the invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is a side view of an injection molding machine in which the      invention may be used; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is a horizontal section at the level of the center axis of the      machine of FIG. 2, seen in a top view; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 is an alternative embodiment of a horizontal section at the level of      the center axis of the machine of FIG. 2, seen in top view. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENTLY PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 1 shows a stationary end plate 11 on which traverses 13, toggle levers      21, 22 and drives 31, 32 are fastened.
