Most big companies already basesome part of their top officers' pay on corporateperformance.   But now companies are increasingly trying to push thehabit further down into the organization. Some rewardindividuals who meet specific goals, some pay for theperformance of small groups, and some for that of the wholecompany.</LP><TEXT>   No matter which they choose, paying for performance istough. Performance is hard to define and harder still tomeasure. Hierarchical organizations still resist varying paylevels by very much. Everyone is happy when performance soarsand pay rises, but the reverse can damage morale.   According to a survey by consultants Hewitt Associates,51% of companies are practicing some form of pay forperformance for more than top management, up from 44% in1989. Still, many of these programs are small, and they'reoften experimental, sometimes limited to a single plant orlocation. The average grant: less than 7% of pay, comparedwith one-half to two-thirds of most CEOs' compensation.   &quot;Most organizations would say they don't do it well,&quot; saysRobert Gandossy, a partner at Hewitt. He notes that oneclient recently surveyed its own pay-for-performance effortsand found that more than half of the projects missed theirtargets.   Consider the fate of Du Pont Co.'s trailblazing attempt.The program required employees of its fibers business groupto risk a percentage of pay for a potentially higher returnif the unit's profits grew. For a while the program &quot;changedthe way a lot of people behaved and thought,&quot; says PatriciaBeagle, a fashion marketing representative at Du Pont. &quot;Ifound my secretary routing me through Godforsaken parts ofthe country&quot; to save $300 on travel costs. On anotheroccasion mailroom employees made her justify the costs of hermailings.   But late last year, two years after it began, the programwas abruptly halted. When the group's profits -- andemployees' pay -- seemed sure to drop, employees revolted.&quot;People wanted choice,&quot; says Robert McNutt, a Du Pontcompensation manager who helped design the program. And thechoice they wanted was to opt out: &quot;I could use that money,&quot;says Patricia Gilstrap, a secretary in the group.   Companies and consultants alike say that despite suchnotable failures, more and more companies will starttailoring pay to results as they scramble to reward stars inthe increasingly competitive labor market. By the year 2000,predicts Sibson andamp; Co., a compensation consulting firm,between 10% and 15% of employee pay will be based onperformance, up from less than 5% in 1980.   Paying for performance isn't new. Most companies years agoabandoned the idea of giving any but unionized workers aregular annual raise, opting instead for pay based onindividual merit. Indeed, in a survey of 2,400 employers byconsultants William M. Mercer Inc., 94% said that at leastpart of employees' compensation was based on perfomance.   But because most managers are unwilling to makedistinctions among their employees and few companies forcethem to do so, most pay in most organizations still moves inlockstep. Seniority and higher-ranking jobs -- notperformance -- confer higher pay. Under a traditional paysystem, says Paul Regan, a senior vice president at CorningInc., &quot;If you tell me the date someone joined a company . . .and the starting pay, I'll tell you within $500 what {he orshe} makes.&quot;   Such a pay system &quot;acts like mayonnaise,&quot; he says. &quot;Ittakes rewards and spreads them evenly around the organizationwithout differentiation.&quot; But while executives today believethat tying employees' pay at least in part to the performanceof their company, their division, their group or themselvesas individuals can help spur performance, choosing amongthose options can be difficult.   Some consultants believe the Du Pont plan failed becausepay was tied to the peformance of too big a group. Jude Rich,president of Sibson, says that plans work only if employeesfeel they can influence the results. Some Du Pont employeesappear to agree: &quot;Philosophically I believe that compensationshould be tied to performance, but I questioned . . . havingmy money invested in something over which I had so littlecontrol,&quot; says Ms. Beagle.   Paying for individual performance, on the other hand,strikes some companies as too difficult. Late last year,Santa Fe Pacific Corp. asked employees to peg a portion oftheir pay to results in their divisions. &quot;I can never see ushaving 2,400 individual plans,&quot; says Russell E. Hagberg, vicepresident, human resources, for the railroad, pipeline andmineral holding company. &quot;You get into subjectiveevaluations, and then you get into personality contests, andpeople think it's not fair.&quot;   At Corning, pay-for-performance programs include spotbonuses of between 3% and 6% of pay for individualachievements. &quot;If someone has done a spiffy job, you need torecognize&quot; him or her, says Peter Maier, director of riskmanagement and prevention. Last year, about 40% of the peoplein his area got one.   While Mr. Maier tries to keep such awards confidential, hesays that when word does leak out, it has a &quot;good news-badnews&quot; effect. &quot;The good news is that people can get one. Thebad news is if I've been doing good work and I didn't getone.&quot; When one Merck andamp; Co. division wanted to post the namesof highachievers -- who were paid more than low achievers --the human resources department overruled the idea. &quot;It hasthe potential to cause undue embarrassment,&quot; says Steven M.Darien, vice president, human resources.   Most compensation consultants agree that paying for theperformance of small, easily defined groups is the mosteffective method. But even then, companies run into troublefiguring out just what to pay for.   When a Corning group set up a trial program to rewardworkers for improving their efficiency, a team struggled tofigure out &quot;what's a meaningful thing to measure? What'sreasonable?&quot; says Bonnie Milliman, manager of customerservices and logistics. The measures finally settled onincluded safety, quality, shipping efficiency and forecastaccuracy.   Still, companies often err. Craig Schneier, a Princeton,N.J., consultant, says one client last year decided to payits buyers bonuses if they kept the cost of purchases down.&quot;The problem was,&quot; says Mr. Schneier, &quot;to make that happen,they were relying on second-tier sources and acceptingpoor-quality materials. The company was in the middle of avery big order, and the fasteners were lousy and ended upcosting millions of dollars, while the sourcing departmentwalked away with big bonuses.&quot;   Most plans have to fight off suspicion and hostility.Employees wonder &quot;is this a ploy? Is there another agenda?&quot;says Mr. Regan. The company spent three years and dozens offocus groups assessing employee opinions before goingforward.   But in other places, such employee suspicion seemsjustified. &quot;One of the problems comes down to managementgreed,&quot; says Hewitt's Mr. Gandossy. &quot;The plan is designed notto pay out a lot, and if it does, we tighten it up.&quot;   He cites a company that two years ago cast about for waysto wiggle out of a plan when it generated a payout of nearly35% of salary per employee. &quot;They were looking for ways tomodify the plan, to pay out only a certain amount, or todefer payments,&quot; he says. The company ultimately paid out thefull amount. The plan was &quot;communicated, implemented,designed and approved by senior managers,&quot; he says. If theyhadn't paid out, &quot;employees would have rebelled.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
