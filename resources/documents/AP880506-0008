Jean-Paul Kauffmann, 44, a reporter for the weekly Evenement duJeudi, recently shared a cell with American educator Frank HerbertReed, who was ``mistreated to the point of being left prostrate,''Kauffmann's sister, Marie-Genevieve Dagin, was quoted as saying byAgence France-Presse.   Reed was director of the Lebanese International School when hewas kidnapped on Sept. 9, 1986.   Mrs. Dagin was quoted by AFP as saying Kauffmann told her theAmerican hostages held by the pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem groupIslamic Jihad were ``the object of brutality because they tried toescape.''   The dispatch did not make clear if Kauffmann specified whichhostages were mistreated for attempting to get away.   Kauffmann, who was abducted May 22, 1985, was freed in Beirut onWednesday with French diplomats Marcel Carton and Marcel Fontaine,who were kidnapped that same year. All three arrived back in Parison Thursday.   In his own interview Friday with AFP, Kauffmann said theremaining Western hostages in Lebanon were ``my main concern. I asktheir families to remain patient and stay confident.''   Nine Americans are among 18 foreigners still missing in Lebanon.Terry Anderson, 40, chief Middle East correspondent for TheAssociated Press, is the longest held. He was seized March 16, 1985.   AFP quoted Kauffmann as saying the Moslems holding foreignhostages often degraded their captives and ``took everything awayfrom us, even our first names. ... Some of our jailers were veryhuman, but in a very hard context ... The best alternated with theworst for reasons that escaped us.''   He said the kidnappers gave each of the three French hostages anew name _ Habib for Carton, Najib for Fontaine, Labib forKauffmann, AFP reported.   Kauffmann identified Abu Ali as a particularly cruel guard, theFrench agency said.   ``He left us in filth, because for him we were impure. Hecontinued to humiliate us, not to mention a mock execution in June1987 which was particularly frightening,'' the French reporter wasquoted as saying.   AFP quoted the journalist as saying he was moved 18 times duringhis years of captivity, and once was bound up like a mummy, put ina sort of coffin under the bed of a truck and warned to stay silentor he would be executed.   Kauffmann was also quoted as saying he read the novel ``War andPeace'' 21 times during his captivity.   Conservative Premier Jacques Chirac on Friday condemned thosewho ``try to insinuate'' that France made a deal with Iran for theFrenchmen's freedom.   Chirac, who faces incumbent Socialist Francois Mitterrand in apresidential runoff election Sunday, said, ``I say solemnly, I sayon my honor, that no negotiation, no compromise, no bargaining, nodeal took place with any foreign government, or even less with anyterrorist group.'' .   AFP, citing unidentified sources it said were close to Frenchnegotiators, said France and Iran agreed to resume formaldiplomatic relations under a 40-day schedule beginning the day thehostages were freed.   France confirmed reports that one-third of a $1 billion loanIran made to France in 1974 has been paid. Other reports have saidthe remainder was being paid in return for freeing Kauffmann,Carton and Fontaine.   Mrs. Dagin was quoted as saying in her interview that shelearned from her brother that Fontaine was briefly held with TerryWaite, the special envoy of the archbishop of Canterbury. Waitedisappeared Jan. 20, 1987, while in Lebanon to seek the hostages'release.   Kauffmann, Mrs. Dagin was quoted as saying, ``found no excusefor his kidnappers, for whom he feels only hate.''</TEXT></DOC>
