The officials say there is insufficient money and trainedmanpower to meet this October's asbestos-inspection deadline, setin 1986 by a Congress upset with the slow pace of the battleagainst the deadly substance.   But groups representing teachers, parents and school employeesare opposing a deadline extension, arguing that such a step isunwarranted and would prolong long-term health threats faced bymillions of schoolchildren.   ``Many local public school districts are incapable ofcompliance,'' a hearing by two Senate Environment subcommittees wastold recently by Robert Anderson, representing the National SchoolBoards Association.   ``By extending the deadlines, Congress will be sending a messageto school districts that it is acceptable to continue to ignore ordelay action on this serious health issue,'' says Ann Lynch, firstvice president of the National PTA.   Once a common building material, asbestos is dangerous when itbecomes friable, or crumbly. Friable asbestos releases the fibersthat can cause a variety of respiratory ailments, including lungcancer. The fibers pose more threat to a child's lungs than to anadult's.</TEXT><HEAD>___</HEAD><HEAD>DuPont Ozone Decision Has Others `Scrambling,' Says Competitor</HEAD><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Du Pont Co.'s call for an eventual end toproduction of ozone-destroying chemicals has other producersscrambling to decide what they should do, a competitor says.   Only one of six other companies in the field in the UnitedStates, Pennwalt Corp. is following Du Pont so far in its March 25announcement that it believes that chlorofluorocarbon compounds,CFCs, and related compounds should be phased out soon.   The conclusions of DuPont and Pennwalt were prompted by a March15 report from a scientific panel organized by the NationalAeronautics and Space Administration that CFCs appear to havecaused an average 2.3 percent decline in the earth's protectiveozone layer at northern mid-latitudes between 1969 and 1986.   At the other end of the spectrum is Great Lakes Chemical Corp.,which, says spokesman Gregory J. Griffiths, believes there is noreason to go beyond the international agreement endorsed by 31nations in Montreal last fall.   So far ratified only by the United States and Mexico, the treatycalls for a 50 percent cut in CFC production by 1998 and a freezeon halons in 1992.   CFCs are used in the United States for refrigeration fluids,cleaning solvents in electronics manufacture and foam blowingagents. Overseas CFCs are also used as aerosol propellants.</TEXT></DOC>
