 The samescheming for dominance and status that afflicts all political activitypermeates LANs and enterprisewide networks.andP;  Instead of geographicalboundaries and economic interests, however, the struggle is over ownershipand control of information resources.andM;Although the connections formed by coaxial or telephone cables may seem astractable as the sea lanes, how information is shipped, what tariffs areimposed and who controls the trade route are anything but neutral issues.andO;Such matters can significantly affect a network's acceptance or viability.andM;As chairman of Network Management Inc., Howard Frank's experience withnetworks has been one of &quot;incredible infighting and political battles&quot;between corporations and their various divisions.andP;  &quot;A corporation tries toput network utilities together to minimize costs and maximize resources,whereas divisions try to build their own networks and manage them throughtheir own bottom lines,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Corporations fight that battle year afteryear, with slow progress toward standards or internetworking capabilities.andO;But it's just a continuous battle of divisions vs.andP;  corporate managers.&quot;andM;Even the language of networking reflects the political dimension.andP;  Terminalswere originally &quot;slaves&quot; linked to their mini or mainframe &quot;masters.&quot; DP/MIScontrolled the host and dictated the routes through which terminals couldaccess information.andP;  In most companies each department's budget gets taxedfor the privilege of being controlled by MIS, and the political strugglesamong management, MIS, departments and users are not unlike those thatbrought about the American and French revolutions in the late 18th century.andM;Revolutionary zeal.andP;  Despite MIS, relatively low-cost LANs -- especially theoriginal &quot;plug-and-play&quot; AppleTalk cabling kits -- fostered the creation ofsmall revolutionary departmental work groups.andP;  With minimal compromise, thesecommunes could share peripherals no single user could justify purchasingalone.andM;MIS first recognized the Mac through terminal emulation and then throughmicro-to-mainframe links that enabled Macs to communicate with hosts asintelligent processors.andP;  But like seditionists printing leaflets in theirbasements, Macintosh users started taking the information they'd been givenaccess to legally, dumping it into their database or spreadsheet packages,producing beautifully laser-printed reports and distributing the informationoutside traditional MIS channels.andM;The proliferation of Macs, IBM PCs and compatibles produced the same kinds ofinternecine struggles that already existed between MIS and everyone else.andO;LANs, which enabled networking to migrate to a level where there is little orno technical expertise, also encouraged an atmosphere of administrativeanarchy in which no one shouldered fiscal responsibility.andM;With the information system's balance of power upset, the first problem,according to Charles Lukaszewski of Open Systems Architects Inc. ofMinneapolis, has been getting companies to realize that &quot;these disparategroups need to be tied together and managed.&quot; What began as a fewwell-concealed, off-budget items has generated tremendous hidden costs.andP;  As aresult, said Frank, the challenge to every company is now &quot;how to replacehuge hidden costs with professional management of these networks so that yougain control of them and the corporation comes out ahead.&quot;andM;Resource management.andP;  Because LANs originated with individual departmentsinstead of MIS or telecommunications, the question of who provides themanagement resources is as pressing as who assumes the financial burden.andO;According to Frank, the political question is: &quot;Are end users, who havefinally found a way to do their jobs outside the normal MIS realm, suddenlygoing to accede control of things that are working to the department theytried to get around?&quot;andM;Inherent in the AppleShare file server's definition of read-write access isthe ability of &quot;each individual who creates something to dynamically controlthe timing of its release to different groups,&quot; according to Chris Bryant,Apple manager of developer relations.andP;  This is counter to the role of thetraditional network administrator, who controls the information flow.andM;In Apple's scheme, &quot;as the network becomes more sophisticated, customersshould increase the sophistication of their network administrator,&quot; saidBryant.andM;Apple provides training material and courses to assist in network growth, butit's up to the organization, Bryant said, &quot;to determine how mature theirusers are, the probability level of malicious users and what hierarchicalcontrols are needed.&quot; In companies where there is already a strongcentralized information center, planning must include the servicedepartment's input as well as education and training to increase theknowledge of resource personnel.andM;Cooperative planning.andP;  Representative democracy is not without its problems.andO;Having exactly the same rights and capabilities as all the other users on thenetwork &quot;can be scary for mainframe guys,&quot; according to former &quot;mainframeguy&quot; Bryant.andP;  &quot;There's a power you get if you become a computing peer on thenetwork,&quot; Bryant said.andP;  The key is in how that power is distributed.andM;Whether it is a new installation or an extension of a network, participationby all affected parties in planning the network is an absolute preconditionto establishing common goals or at least a balance of interests.andP;  Anorganization needs to ask itself:andM;andgt;What are everyone's expectations?andM;andgt;Will connecting individuals improve or compound information flow problems?andM;andgt;What are the bottom-line benefits of networking?andM;andgt;Who is going to pay for the installation and the resources required on anongoing basis?andM;andgt;Who is going to control those resources?andM;Conflicts among multiple internal interests are compounded because networkingbeyond small LANs is a multivendor proposition requiring someone to translatebetween the vendors and the customer.andP;  A consultant is often brought in toarbitrate among factions and negotiate a solution.andP;  Both Lukaszewski andFrank find themselves filling the role of the technological diplomat byacting as a liaison among vendors, developers and the various levels withinorganizations.andM;Open architecture.andP;  The foundation of any network organization is acommitment to an architecture.andP;  Some architectures are open or complementaryand easily allow for multivendor integration, and others -- most notoriouslyIBM -- are more closed and antagonistic.andP;  The evolution beyond earlier simplestop-start protocols to the Open Systems Interconnect (OSI) model supportedby Ethernet and AppleTalk has fostered recognition of a broad range ofmultivendor computing power.andM;Lukaszewski is working on a project to link several hospitals in metropolitanMinneapolis so they can exchange patient information.andP;  Although accountinginformation has long been computerized, patient information has not.andP;  Atbest, it is kept on a hospital level, but more often it is confined todepartments within hospitals.andP;  The first problem Lukaszewski encountered wasa wide array of hardware.andP;  Once you get past the hardware incompatibilities,there's still no &quot;systemwide procedure, protocol or database program linkingthe different organizations,&quot; he said.andM;But the architectural integration on the system interface level that Applehas championed is perhaps the most significant commitment an organizationfaces.andP;  The focus of Apple's ongoing networking strategy is to maintain ahigh-level interface that provides users with the same kind of vernacularconsistency that has traditionally been offered by telephone networks.andP;  Usersshould not have to translate different machine languages and protocols, justas they should not have to choose among fiber-optic, satellite or microwavetransmission facilities when they use the telephone.andM;Compliance with the OSI model has made possible Apple's strategic alliancesand architectural integration with Digital Equipment Corp.andP;  Through workingwith network consultants and third-party systems groups, Apple's Bryant found&quot;there's a lot of demand from customers for the same type of integration theysee in DEC's environment for IBM hosts.andP;  But IBM isn't an open-architecturecompany the way DEC is.&quot;andM;Because computer networks can just as easily reinforce as dissolve powerrelations within companies or between vendors, companies are beginning torealize that networking means re-evaluating and then reorganizing the waypeople work.andM;Nancy Canning is a technical consultant and free-lance writer in Mill Valley,Calif.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
