(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Prompted by a shooting spree that lefteight dead and 13 wounded at a printing plant, a state lawmaker saidFriday he would sponsor a bill in the General Assembly to outlawassault weapons.   ``We owe it to the families and the other victims to try at leastto make it harder for a deranged person to obtain the weapon,'' saidfreshman Rep. Mike Ward, a Democrat.   Ward said he would file a bill for the legislative session thatbegins in January, despite a key House leader's assessment that themeasure's chance of passing would be slim.   The National Rifle Association, which helped defeat gun controllegislation in the General Assembly in 1984, was unconcerned aboutthe bill, a spokesman for the firearms lobby said.   The issue was revived after Thursday's rampage at StandardGravure Corp. by a heavily armed employee with a history of mentalillness. Joseph T. Wesbecker killed seven people with a Chinese-madesemiautomatic AK-47 assault rifle, then killed himself with aGerman-made 9mm pistol.   The small arsenal he carted into the plant in a gym bag includedtwo MAC-11 machine pistols, a .38-caliber revolver and hundreds ofrounds of ammunition.   A person bent on such mayhem would not be stopped by an anti-gunbill, said William E. Smith, the League of Kentucky Sportsmen'srepresentative to the NRA.   ``You just can't legislate against a nut,'' said Smith.   Rep. Greg Stumbo, a ``card-carrying NRA member'' who as Housemajority floor leader helps control the flow of legislation, saidWard would have an uphill fight for his bill.   House leaders usually allow any bill to go to the floor for avote if _ and it's a big if _ it makes it out of committee, saidStumbo, a Democrat. ``I don't think the chances of that measurewould be very good,'' Stumbo said.   Louisville and Lexington once had ordinances requiring a waitingperiod for handgun buyers, but that changed in the 1984 GeneralAssembly with a bill backed by the NRA.   The bill, which sailed through both the House and Senate,prohibited local governments from enacting gun-control measures ofany type.   But now, ``with this proliferation of high-powered assaultweapons, attitudes of the general public are changing. We just haveto see that these weapons are different,'' Ward said.   ``I think the NRA will discredit itself by opposing a ban onassault rifles because assault rifles are not in any way a sportingweapon. There would be nothing left of a squirrel to eat after ithad been shot with an AK-47,'' Ward said.   Smith said the NRA was ``extremely sorry about the terrible thingthat happened,'' but that ``nothing has changed'' about theorganization's opposition to gun legislation.   The tragedy was not due simply to Wesbecker's possession ofautomatic or semiautomatic weapons, he said. ``The man could havewalked into that place ... with a pump shotgun and done a lot moredamage than he did with this so-called assault rifle,'' Smith said.   Louisville Police Chief Richard Dotson called for a national banon assault weapons, saying, ``What do you need these for, except forkilling people?''   And Archbishop Thomas Kelly alluded to gun-control laws at a Massfor the shooting victims.   ``We are a democratic society,'' Kelly said. ``We've got to beable to find ways to keep this from happening again.''   But it will not be prevented with legislation like Ward's, Smithsaid.   ``I don't think it will ever happen in our state,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
