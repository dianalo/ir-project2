Forms Two Exploration and Producing Regions</HEAD><DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Texaco U.S.A. announced Tuesday it would form twomajor exploration and producing regional organizations andstreamline its operations in an effort to boost sagging productionprofits.   James L. Dunlap, president of Houston-based Texaco U.S.A., saidthe new regions to be headquartered in Denver and New Orleans arepart of a major restructuring announced by Texaco Inc. last year andreflect a ``refocused business strategy.''   Texaco, based in White Plains, N.Y., recently completed the saleof more than $7 billion in assets following its emergence frombankruptcy protection last year. The restructuring has reduced thesize of the nation's third largest oil concern and focused itsattention on exploration and production rather than refining andmarketing.   The two new regions and 12 divisions will replace the Texacosubsidiary's existing 26 offices that currently employ about 7,300people nationwide, company spokesman Paul Weeditz said.   He said some employee relocations and reductions were expected,but, ``We're uncertain at this point as to the ultimate impact onemployment.''   Specific plans for the restructuring are expected to be completedby the end of the year.   ``The idea is to move the decision point as close to the wellheadas possible, so that each division operates as would a successfulindependent company, making its own operating decisions with minimumreview at other management levels while being accountable for itsown performance,'' Dunlap said.   The New Orleans-based region, or the East Region, will beresponsible for the company's onshore and offshore exploration andproduction in the Gulf Coast and Eastern Seaboard areas.   The Denver-based region, or the West Region, will be responsiblefor those activities in the Mid-Continent, West Coast and otherareas.   Vice President William Wallace will head the New Orleans-basedregion, while Vice President L. Paul Teague will head the westernregion. Both will report to Gerald F. Rome in Houston, the executivevice president of exploration, producing and gas.   The East Region's five units will include two exploration andexploitation divisions based in New Orleans and two producingdivisions, with one in Harvey, La., and the other in Morgan City,La. The fifth division, also based in New Orleans, will beresponsible for producing properties owned by Texaco but operated byothers.   The West Region's seven units will include producing divisions inBakersfield, Calif., Ventura, Calif., Midland, Texas and Denver; twoexploration and exploitation divisions in Denver; a division inDenver that will be responsible for Texaco-owned properties operatedby others; and an exploitation unit in Midland.   Dunlap noted that the Natural Gas Department, Texaco U.S.A.'sother major ``upstream,'' or exploration and production, business,may be in for some restructuring in the future.</TEXT></DOC>
