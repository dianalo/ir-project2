Carlucci announcedtoday that the Pentagon has suspended payment on $1 billion incontracts that may have been tainted by bribes and fraud.   The suspensions will not damage national security, he said.   Carlucci said that he took the action as a result of documentsin the case unsealed by a judge in Federal District Court inDallas. The affidavits disclosed that a defense consultant passedalong inside information on nine Navy contracts worth more than$522 million in a conversation that was monitored by the FBI.   Additionally, Carlucci said the department was beginningsuspension procedures against three individuals and a company namedin the documents, reviewing existing contracts with four implicatedcompanies, and freezing new contracts on nine weapons systems.   ``The affidavit provides the department with evidence concerningindividuals and companies,'' he said.   ``The Navy has initiated suspension procedures with respect toGeorge Stone, Mark Saunders, Joe Bradley'' and the ContinentalElectronics Division of Varian Associates Inc., he said.   Carlucci said the companies and officials involved were beingnotified of the Petagon action.   And he said the department would take further actions asevidence in the case becomes public.   `Wherever we have specific evidence, we will take action. As Ihave indicated previously, we do not need to wait (for)convictions, or even trials, for that matter,'' he said.   ``We are in an ongoing dialogue with the Department ofJustice,'' which is conducting the investigation, he said. ``TheDepartment of Justice quite correctly points out that what they aredealing with is grand jury information, and (it) would beinappropriate for them to supply this information to us at thistime. But as soon as they are able to, they will be supplyinginformation to us, and as soon as we get the information, we willact.''   Until Pentagon officials see what is in other affidavits in thecase, he said, ``until we have all the information from theDeparment of Justice, we can't make ... judgements. All we can dois wait for the wheels of justice to take their course.''   Carlucci said the current actions did not gravely impairnational security, but that additional suspensions might.   ``If you say `impact on national security', clearly anythingthat slows down the process of producing defense equipment orrequires us to reopen contracts has an impact on our ability to getequipment in the field,'' he said.   ``If you are talking about grave or serious impact on readinessor modernization programs, I would not yet put what we have donetoday in that category. But clearly it has an impact,'' he said.   Carlucci said the Pentagon was reviewing existing contracts withfour companies named in the affidavit, Litton Industries Inc.,Norden, Hazeltine, and Emhart. Of the four, only Litton has beennamed by the Pentagon as among the top 100 companies with which itdoes buiness.   The largest single weapons system on which payments are beingfrozen is called the Anti-Submarine Operating Center, a $712million system of shore-based command and control centers tocoorinate efforts to locate, and in time of war destroy, submarines.   The second most costly weapons system mentioned by Carlucci wasthe Digital Communications Terminal, a $150 million program todevelop a hand-held computerized unit to compose messages to betransmitted in short bursts by military field radios to minimizethe possibility that they could be intercepted or decoded by enemyforces.   The next largest was the Advanced Tactical Air Command Central,a $118 million program to replace existing installations that usedadvanced electronics to coordinate air defenses.   The other six weapons systems on which new contract actions werebeing suspended were: the Tactical Environmental Support System, a$58 million Navy program; a $51 million fiber optical project; theDigital Wideband Radio set, being developed at a cost of $49million; a $38 million anti-submarine warfare electronics displayunit; the $30 million Bancroft radio for tanks and the MarineCorps' light armored vehicles; and a $6.3 million project todevelop very low frequency and low frequency communications gear.</TEXT></DOC>
