A reduction of 10 to 20% can be achieved bycareful calculation and comparison of all competitive junction pointdetails. Point disturbances and linear disturbances must be eliminatedif they cause low temperatures of the inner surfaces (leading to fungalgrowth and water condensation), or if they reduce the heat transfer coefficientbeyond the acceptable limit. To give an example, metal ridges in metalpanels for thermal insulation of outer walls may turn out to be heatbridges with devastating effects. (orig./BWI).</TEXT></DOC>
