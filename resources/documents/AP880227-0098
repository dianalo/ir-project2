Alton G. Keel Jr. said the Soviet move, rather than being ameaningful expression of good will, was part of an orchestratedcampaign to convince West Europeans that the Soviet Union ischanging its ways.   ``We, obviously from the U.S. standpoint, welcome the fact thatthey're withdrawing the missiles, but there'll be no similar actionon the part of the U.S.,'' Keel said in an interview at hisofficial residence outside Brussels.   Soviet soldiers on Thursday left two bases in East Germany andone garrison in Czechoslovakia, taking with them the first nuclearmissiles dismantled under a U.S.-Soviet treaty eliminating allland-based nuclear rockets with ranges between 310 miles and 3,100miles.   The missiles moved out of East Germany and Czechoslovakia, knownin the West as SS-12s, have ranges of up to 550 miles.   The treaty signed by President Reagan and Soviet leader MikhailS. Gorbachev last Dec. 8 does not require either side to withdrawor destroy any missiles until it has been ratified by bothgovernments. The U.S. Senate is expected to approve it by latespring.   Keel said Washington could not withdraw any of its more than 400Tomahawk cruise and Pershing 2 ballistic nuclear missiles fromWestern Europe until after the Senate decides whether to ratify thetreaty.   He noted that the Soviets have said they will not actuallydestroy any of the withdrawn SS-12 missiles until after the treatyhas been ratified by the Senate and by the Soviet parliament, theSupreme Soviet.   ``They obviously want to take as much advantage of their havingbeen willing to enter into this agreement as possible, use it toadvantage, try to convince European publics that there's been majornew thinking in the Soviet Union,'' he said.   Keel said the United States already had shown its good will byvoluntarily halting deployment of cruise and Pershing 2 missiles assoon as the treaty was signed.   ``We actually did concede something unilaterally, we concededthat we would no longer deploy systems,'' even though NATO had notyet reached its original target of deploying 572 of themedium-range missiles, he said.   The Soviet move, he said, did little to increase the security ofNATO nations, which continues to be threatened by the existence ofmore than 1,400 short-range Soviet nuclear missiles in Europe and aWarsaw Pact numerical edge over the Western alliance in non-nucleararms.   Keel said it ``would be meaningful'' if Moscow unilaterallywithdrew some of its shortest-range nuclear arms and conventionallyarmed troops, but that NATO would make no reciprocal gesturebecause its forces already are at a bare minimum to deter apossible Soviet attack.</TEXT></DOC>
