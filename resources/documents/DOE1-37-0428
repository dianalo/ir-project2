<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-37-0428 </DOCNO><TEXT>In an IP steam turbine of single stage construction, cooling steam forcooling the rotor surface and the first rows of moving blades is suppliedvia holes in the wall of the inflow part. The cooling steam is takenvia a guide sheet on the wall of the inflow part to the annular spacesbetween the shaft seals of the guide vanes and the rotor surface andvia axial cooling ducts to the blade roots of the moving blades. Radialconnecting ducts are provided at each moving blade of the rows of bladesconnected by the axial cooling ducts, which transfer the cooling steamto the axial ducts, which connect the annular spaces below the shaftseals of the adjacent guide vanes. Such an IP steam turbine built asa chamber can be used as a ship's turbine.</TEXT></DOC>
