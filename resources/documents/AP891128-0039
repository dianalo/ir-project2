(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Virginia's closest and most prolongedelection for governor next goes before a three-judge panel thatwill supervise a recount requested by the Republican who lost toDemocrat L. Douglas Wilder.   J. Marshall Coleman, a former attorney general, said Monday hewants a recount and an investigation of alleged irregularities inthe Nov. 7 balloting.   The State Board of Elections said that Wilder beat Coleman by6,854 votes, or .38 percent, out of nearly 1.8 million votes cast.Unofficial returns had showed a 6,852-vote lead for Wilder, thestate's lieutenant governor who will be the nation's first electedblack governor.   Coleman is entitled to a taxpayer-funded recount if the marginis less than half a percent. Election results have been overturnedin at least one recount of a local race in Virginia, but this willbe the first statewide recount.   Coleman said he would contest the election to the GeneralAssembly unless the recount and other information convinces himthat the proceeding is ``no longer necessary to safeguard theaccuracy and integrity'' of the election.   In a notice to General Assembly leaders, Coleman said voterregistration lists used in the election contained the names ofpeople ineligible to vote.   ``In an election as close as this one, irregularities whichwould not ordinarily have a probable impact on the outcome assume agreater importance,'' Coleman said in an accompanying letter.   A panel of three judges will rule on the recount, which willinvolve a check of each paper ballot and election machine.Seventy-five of the state's 1,967 precincts still use paper ballotsthat are kept under seal in local clerks' offices, said SusanFitz-Hugh, secretary of the State Board of Elections.   The judges _ the chief judge of the Richmond Circuit Court andtwo others appointed by the Virginia Supreme Court _ will hold ahearing to decide how to conduct the recount.   She could not predict how long it would take, but said, ``Weusually have finished all our recounts prior to Christmas.''   If Coleman contests the election, the matter would first comebefore the privileges and elections committees of the House andSenate, said state Sen. Stanley C. Walker, the Democratic presidentpro tempore of the Senate.   Walker, who won a contested election for his Senate seat in1979, said the proceeding would resemble a trial with lawyers forboth candidates presenting witnesses and evidence to thelegislators.</TEXT></DOC>
