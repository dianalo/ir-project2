How much longer will you hide?'' saidanother sign, referring to the protection Great Britain has giventhe author, who lives in London, following death threats fromIslamic fundamentalists.   At a smaller rally in Boston, about 40 people paraded in a circleon the Common carrying signs reading ``Blasphemy Does Not EqualFreedom of Speech, Respect for All Religions.''   Events in two other cities gave both sides the opportunity to beheard.   Writers gathered on the steps of the main Atlanta library todenounce the death threats. U.S. Rep. Ben Jones, D-Ga., invited asmall group of Moslem protesters to the microphone, saying, ``Wehave our disagreements, but we respect your freedom.''   He said later, however, ``The ayatollah and his fanaticalfollowers can go to hell.''   On Los Angeles radio station KPFK-FM, William Schallert and otheractors read excerpts from the novel as part of an hourlong programthat also featured authors discussing free speech issues and expertson Islam explaining why Moslems have condemned the book.   Moslems from across the country joined the mid-afternoon rally inManhattan, and some carried the flags of Iran, Pakistan andBangladesh, all Islamic nations. Demonstrators also carried signssaying, ``Viking Penguin, we gonna fix you up'' and ``Satanic VersesEquals Literary Terrorism.''   Police guarded the publisher's front entrance, watching theprotesters as they listened to the chant ``Allah is great!''blasting through loudspeakers. No arrests were made, police said.   ``We support Rushdie's death according to the laws of Islam,''said Mohammed Muwahid, an engineer who works for the city of NewYork and was born in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.   ``There's a need to take planned action,'' said Shahid Mahmood, aPakistani-born investment broker with Robert W. Baird andamp; Co.   Mahmood, of Pine Brook, N.J., said American Moslems are planninga march on Washington D.C. within the next two weeks if VikingPenguin does not stop publishing and selling Rushdie's book.   At the Islamic Center of North America in Plainfield, Ind.,officials said Rushdie's book is an offense on religion in general,not just Islam.   Moslems say the book depicts the Islamic prophet Mohammed througha blasphemous fictional character and names prostitutes afterMohammed's wives.   ``It slurs women of virtue that have been used by one billionpeople as models of morality, of family organization and kindness,''said Dawood Zwink, vice president of the Islamic Society of NorthAmerica.   Rushdie has labeled the book as fiction and apologized for thedistress its has caused. But Iranian leader Ayatollah RuhollahKhomeini has stood by the $5.2 million bounty offered for Rushdie'sexecution.   President Bush and Western Europe's leaders have condemned thedeath threat, and many writers have rallied to support Rushdie'sfreedom of expression.</TEXT></DOC>
