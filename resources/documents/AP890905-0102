Armed Forces spokesmen reported the deaths of the soldiers afterthe pre-dawn fighting outside Chilanga in Morazan province. In anofficial statement, they said the rebels also suffered ``numerouscasualties'' but gave no number.   The official death toll was the highest since the armed forcesacknowledged 69 soldiers killed in a guerrilla attack March 31,1987, on the 4th Army Brigade headquarters in the northern provinceof Chalatenango.   The rebels, on their clandestine Radio Venceremos, said Tuesdaytheir forces inflicted 25 casualties, including dead and wounded, ongovernment forces outside Chilanga.   However, the military said the government forces suffered sixwounded, for a total of 22 casualties in three hours of fighting.   The nearly decade-old civil war has killed an estimated 70,000people.   The rightist government of President Alfredo Cristiani, who tookoffice June 1, says it wants to talk with the rebels about endingthe war. The guerrillas also say they want peace talks, but themechanism and agenda for such dialogue has yet to be worked out.   Also Tuesday, an anti-tank rocket smashed into the headquartersof a leftist labor federation before dawn. The missile damaged thefacade of the San Salvador headquarters of the group, known asFenastras, but it caused no casualties.   Gerardo Diaz, the group's secretary general, blamed the armedforces for the attack.   ``This is a provocation that is part of a generalized campaignagainst the organized labor movement,'' he said.   The government and armed forces consider Fenastras and severalother left-of-center unions, peasant groups, and human rightsorganizations to be guerrilla fronts.</TEXT></DOC>
