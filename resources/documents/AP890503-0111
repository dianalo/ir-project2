SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   America's people, statistically speaking, area just shade older than they've ever been before, with the medianage in the United States reaching a record 32.3 years, the CensusBureau reported Wednesday.   That means half of all the people living in the country wereolder than 32.3 years, and half younger, as of last July 1. This isup from the median age of 32.1 a year earlier.   By states, in terms of the median age, Nebraska and NorthCarolina are in the middle while the oldest Americans are inFlorida and the youngest in Utah.   The maturing of the massive Baby Boom generation, born in theyears following World War II, is raising the nation's median age,census officials and other analysts have noted.   This group forms the largest segment of the population and as itages the median age is pulled along, Census demographer Ed Byerlysaid in a telephone interview.   After years of climbing gradually as life spans increased, themedian age reached 30 for the first time in the 1950 census, whenit was 30.2 years.   But then the full force of the Baby Boom began to occur and thelarge number of children in the population pulled the median downfor two decades.   In 1980, the median edged back up to 30 again and has continuedclimbing since then, as the Baby Boomers pursued careers andeducation and postponed having families, creating what somestatisticians call a Baby Bust.   In the last few years, total births have begun rising as agingBaby Boomers began having children, but those numbers remain toosmall to have a major impact on the national median, Byerly said.   Retirement-haven Florida remains the state with the oldestpopulation, with a median age of 36.4 years, up from 36.3 years in1987.   Following Florida, the highest median ages were reported for thelarge industrial states in the Northeast, with New Jersey second at34.5 years followed by Connecticut and Pennsylvania at 34.4.   Indeed, the Northeast has the highest median age of the fourregions at 33.9 years. Next is the Midwest at 32.3 _ same as thenational figure _ followed by the South, 32; and the West, 31.6.   The state with the youngest residents remains Utah, where halfof the population is under 25.7 years, and half over. A yearearlier, Utah's median age was 25.5.   Next lowest is Alaska, with a median figure of 28.7 years.   Two states, Nebraska and North Carolina, match the nationalmedian age, while the populations of 20 states and the District ofColumbia are older than the nation as a whole. The remaining 28states have median ages younger than that of the country.
