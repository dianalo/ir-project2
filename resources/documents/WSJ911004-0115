He was the only personwho always got through to Boesky. Mr. Boesky put his fingersto his lips and looked around the table, ordering silence.Then he picked up the phone. There were no pleasantries. Mr.Boesky himself said little, mostly indicating agreement withwhatever Mr. Milken was saying. When he hung up, his eyeswere gleaming with excitement. &quot;We're putting all engines onmax,&quot; Mr. Boesky exclaimed to his assembled traders.   He ordered his staff to buy as much stock of DiamondShamrock as possible, while selling short OccidentalPetroleum, betting that Diamond Shamrock would rise in priceand Occidental would fall. The Boesky staff was baffled.Neither stock had been on their research or trading liststhat morning. What had Mr. Milken told Mr. Boesky?   In fact, the night before, Drexel Burnham Lambert's WestCoast office had been told confidentially that OccidentalPetroleum Corp. and Diamond Shamrock planned to merge in astock swap that would probably cause Diamond Shamrock's stockprice to rise and Occidental's to fall. Since Drexel wasbeing retained by Occidental, Drexel's traders were barred bylaw and firm rules from trading in the stock. But that didn'tstop Mr. Milken, a man so powerful that he seemed omniscient.   Mr. Boesky's staff members weren't the only witnesses tothe phone call. Mr. Milken's top salesman, James Dahl, wassitting next to Mr. Milken at the trading desk when Mr.Milken called Mr. Boesky, and listened as Mr. Milken issuedthe trading orders and he and Mr. Boesky refined theirstrategy to capitalize on the still-secret information.Unknown to Mr. Milken, this was the conversation overheard onMr. Boesky's end by his traders. And, in fact, under a secretarrangement, Mr. Milken and Mr. Boesky owned the positions50-50.   Even now, after pleading guilty to six felonies, Mr.Milken insists that he never engaged in insider trading. Hisspokesmen deny the account reported here, which is based onnumerous interviews, including eyewitnesses, and review ofsworn testimony. As these previously unreported details show,Diamond Shamrock looks like a brazen example of Mr. Milken'sand Mr. Boesky's joint insider trading.   But the scheme proved star-crossed. The following Monday,Diamond Shamrock's board unexpectedly rejected the deal. Toldof the development, Mr. Milken grabbed the phone, called Mr.Boesky and, as Mr. Dahl again listened, practically screamed:&quot;The deal didn't go through. We've got to get out of theposition.&quot;   In New York, Mr. Boesky was apoplectic, franticallyordering his head trader to unload the positions before thenews became public. But it was too late; the ticker sooncarried the news of the scotched deal, and every arbitragerwas trying to dump Diamond Shamrock. Over the next day Mr.Boesky's traders struggled to contain the loss. Mr. Milkenscreamed at Mr. Boesky for taking too long to get out of thepositions. Mr. Boesky screamed at Mr. Milken for getting theminto the mess. When it was all over, Mr. Milken brooded athis desk. When Mr. Dahl asked what the matter was, Mr. Milkenincautiously explained that he had a position &quot;off-line&quot; withMr. Boesky and that the deal's collapse had just cost them$10 million.   Even though the conspirators lost money (insider tradingis a crime whether money is made or lost), the trading setthe stage for Wall Street's most sweeping criminal conspiracysince the passage of the securities laws -- in which crimesof far greater reach than insider trading would becomeroutine.   What follows are major, newly revealed episodes fromhistory's biggest insider trading scandal. Because most ofthe major players, including Mr. Milken and Mr. Boesky, endedup striking deals with the government that allowed them toplead guilty to relatively technical and minor-soundingcrimes, the true scope of their misdeeds has never beenpublicly documented.   Mr. Milken's crimes alone were massive: systematicallyrobbing clients by trading on their confidential informationfor his own gain, manipulating securities prices to forcedeals on which he could make huge fees, gouging unsuspectingclients on junk-bond trades, and in at least two cases,taking for himself, his relatives and a few Drexel colleaguessecurities meant for his customers.   This story also shows, for the first time, how thegovernment brought the criminals to justice. One governmentagent posed as a blackmailer in order to trick a key memberof the insider-trading ring to confess his crimes. It showshow Mr. Milken's lawyers and public relations advisers triedto manipulate potential witnesses and the press, and itreveals that Mr. Milken actually tried to plead guilty a yearbefore he finally did so. But his plea was rejected byprosecutors because it came less than an hour after thedeadline they had set.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 As their power grew and the volume of their dealsskyrocketed, Mr. Milken's band of traders and salesmenheadquartered in Beverly Hills took on a superhuman aura -- atight-knit group working 16-hour days under extreme pressureand loving every minute of it.   In fact, the ruthless quest for profits set by Mr. Milkenin Beverly Hills was debilitating. Head trader Warren Treppbegan smoking four packs of cigarettes a day. Bruce Newbergstarted taking blood pressure medicine. One day Mr. Newbergraved hysterically when his phone line went dead during animportant client call. It turned out Mr. Newberg had chewedthrough the cord. Another employee, Gary Winnick, complainedhe was developing a brain tumor and other serious ailments,though he remained healthy. Cary Maultasch developedpsychological problems, began seeing a psychiatrist, andasked to be transferred to Drexel's New York office.   Mr. Milken set the tone, badgering traders for notsqueezing the most out of a trade, hectoring employees whotried to leave after only 12 hours of work. When Mr. Dahltold Mr. Milken he was leaving early one day after learninghis mother had cancer, Mr. Milken's only response was, &quot;Whenare you going to be back?&quot; Even when Mr. Milken himselfbriefly keeled over at his desk on the trading floor in 1981,his brother and co-worker Lowell came over, viewed theunconscious body, and simply returned to his office. Themessage was clear: Keep working.   As early as 1982, Mr. Milken was making $45 million ayear, but his aides were struck by how obsessed he was withenhancing his wealth and power. Chatting with Mr. Winnick oneday, Mr. Milken looked at the view across Century City andWest Los Angeles to the coast and asked, &quot;What do you thinkit'd cost to buy every building from here to the ocean?&quot;   Once Mr. Milken discovered how his vast network ofjunk-bond buyers could be harnessed to hostile takeovers, hetold his colleague Mr. Trepp in a tone of grim determinationthat &quot;We're going to tee up GM, Ford and IBM, and make themcringe.&quot;                                                                                                                           THE JUNIOR PARTNER                                                                                                          Mr. Boesky was the ideal partner in crime. For despite hisfearsome reputation, he had neither Mr. Milken's marketacumen nor his access to funds. Like so many of the clientsthat accepted Mr. Milken's millions, Mr. Boesky becamedependent. Drexel was supplying most of his financing -- andcharging him a whopping 17% interest.   Mr. Boesky exhibited his own eccentricities, especiallywhen the subject was food. When he met stock trader JohnMulheren for the first time at a dinner party at Manhattan'selegant Cafe des Artistes, Mr. Boesky was asked for hisorder. &quot;I'll have every entree,&quot; Mr. Boesky said. Thewaiter's pen stopped in midair. Mr. Boesky repeated, &quot;I'llhave every entree.&quot; When the food arrived, the waiter had towheel a table next to them. On it were that day's eightfeatured entrees. Mr. Boesky circled the table, looked themover closely, and took one bite of each. He selected one, andsent the rest back.   Mr. Boesky ran his office with an intensity similar to Mr.Milken's. When Mr. Boesky took a rare day off, he harassedhis employees with calls to ensure that everyone else wasstill there working. He had remote control televisioninstalled in the office so he could watch each employee fromhis own control panel. Mr. Boesky's head of research, LanceLessman, once complained to Mr. Boesky's son, Billy, that&quot;Your dad's really been beating up on me.&quot; &quot;Seriouslyunderstand my father,&quot; Billy said in a somber tone. &quot;He isstark raving mad.&quot;   When Mr. Milken enlisted Mr. Boesky in his schemes, Mr.Boesky was predisposed toward crime. He was already tradingillegally on secret information from one of Wall Street'sbrightest young stars, Martin Siegel. The Kidder Peabodyinvestment banker seemed to have it all: a beautiful wife, aspectacular Connecticut oceanfront estate, glowing press. ButMr. Siegel came to feel he couldn't live on his earnings ofmore than half a million dollars a year. The Connecticuthouse had cost $750,000. His wife needed full-time help withtheir baby. Their Manhattan apartment was too small, and whatthey considered an appropriate one would cost another $1million. He was haunted, irrationally, by the bankruptcy ofhis father.   So Mr. Siegel convinced himself that he needed to provideMr. Boesky with inside information. The payoff would be cashdelivered by an Iranian courier who, Mr. Siegel came tolearn, always seemed to skim something off the top.Otherwise, the payoffs went smoothly. On two occasions Mr.Siegel met the courier in the lobby of the Plaza Hotel. Afterthe courier gave the Boesky-dictated password -- &quot;red light&quot;-- and Mr. Siegel responded, &quot;green light,&quot; the briefcasecontaining the cash, neatly tied in Caesars Palace casinoribbons, was handed over.   But in 1985, Mr. Boesky decided he didn't want to riskanother handoff in the Plaza lobby. He told Mr. Siegel to beat a phone booth on 55th and First Ave. precisely at 9 a.m.Mr. Siegel would pick up the receiver and pretend to bemaking a call. While he was on the phone, the courier wouldstand behind him as though he were waiting to make a call. Hewould place a briefcase by Mr. Siegel's left leg, thendisappear.   Mr. Siegel arrived at the pay phone early on the appointeddate. To kill time, he sat down at a table in the window of acoffee shop across the street. As he sipped his coffee, hespotted someone who had to be the courier: a swarthy manwearing a black peacoat.   Then Mr. Siegel saw someone else. About a half-block upthe street, he spotted another dark-skinned man keeping aneye on the man Mr. Siegel suspected was the courier. Mr.Siegel started to panic. What was going on? Suddenly all ofMr. Siegel's fears about Mr. Boesky's reputed ties to theC.I.A. came to the fore. &quot;They're going to kill me,&quot; Mr.Siegel thought. He fled.   Mr. Boesky called him later that day. &quot;How did it go?&quot; heasked.   &quot;Nothing went,&quot; Mr. Siegel answered. &quot;There was more thanone person there.&quot;   &quot;Of course,&quot; said Mr. Boesky. &quot;There always is. I want tomake sure they deliver.&quot; Mr. Siegel was amazed that Mr.Boesky didn't trust his own courier. Mr. Boesky insisted thatMr. Siegel repeat the exercise at the phone booth. This timethe plan went without a hitch, and Mr. Siegel collected thatyear's &quot;bonus&quot; of $350,000.   But the frightening experience caused Mr. Siegel to pullaway from Mr. Boesky, and eventually to stop giving himinside information. His attention was increasingly absorbedby his efforts to use insider trading profits to prop up afaltering Kidder Peabody. To this end, he launched an evenbroader insider trading scheme with Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co.partner and chief arbitrager Robert Freeman.   While Mr. Freeman would later plead guilty to a singlecount of insider trading and his defenders would go on tovigorously assert his innocence and mistreatment byoverzealous prosecutors, Messrs. Freeman and Siegel stoleinformation from their firms and their clients to tradeillegally on numerous deals. These included; ChampionInternational's bid for St. Regis paper; Kohlberg, KravisRoberts andamp; Co.'s purchase of Beatrice Cos.; and T. BoonePickens's raid on Unocal. As Mr. Freeman once cynically jokedto Mr. Siegel: &quot;I've got to hand it to you. You really knowhow to trade information.&quot;                                                                                                                           MAJOR LEAGUE CRIME                                                                                                          For the Milken/Boesky team, insider trading was a mere waystation toward bigger goals and bigger crimes. They werewilling, for example, to lose money on their insider tradingwhen a broader goal was sought. In 1984, when Milken clientStephen Wynn of Golden Nugget Inc. found himself stuck with abig position in MCA, Mr. Milken simply directed Mr. Boesky tobuy MCA shares until he had driven up the price sufficientlythat Mr. Wynn could sell his stake at a profit. There is noevidence that Mr. Wynn knew of this illegal arrangement.   Mr. Boesky lost money selling his own shares, of course.Mr. Milken now owed Mr. Boesky $10 million. Paying him withsomething so simple as a check was out of the question: Itwould create a paper trail, and, more important, it wouldcost Mr. Milken money. Instead, Mr. Milken would get his ownjunk-bond customers to pay.   He directed Mr. Boesky to buy junk bonds from Milkenclients, sell them back to Drexel at inflated prices,generating profits for Mr. Boesky. Then Drexel would convinceother clients to buy the bonds at even higher prices. Some ofthe clients weren't smart enough to realize what washappening; others simply owed Mr. Milken for the many favorshe did for them. In less than six months, Mr. Milken repaidMr. Boesky more than $10 million. And in doing so, hegenerated further trading profits for his own operation.   The double threat of Milken information and Boesky buyingpower may have reached its apogee with the 1985 takeover byDrexel client Maxxam Group of Pacific Lumber. Pacific Lumberwas gearing up to resist, but then Mr. Boesky started buyingthe company's shares on Mr. Milken's orders. Mr. Milken, ofcourse, was privy to Maxxam's confidential plans, includingthe price it would ultimately be willing to pay. As usual,Mr. Milken shared ownership of Mr. Boesky's positions andpromised to cover any possible losses. Mr. Boesky's SECfilings, of course, made no mention of Mr. Milken's secretinterest.   Maxxam raised its offer, and, feeling under pressure fromtwo raiders, Pacific Lumber capitulated. Mr. Milken's schemenetted Drexel more than $20 million in fees and generatedover $1 million in insider trading profits on the stock ownedjointly by Messrs. Milken and Boesky. Pacific Lumber underMaxxam control soon aroused the ire of conservationists byfelling tracts of redwood forest to meet its junk-bondpayments.   But Mr. Milken's most lucrative ploy may have been histaking Beatrice Cos. warrants in connection with theleveraged buy-out of the company by KKR. Mr. Milken hadextracted the warrants (the right to buy Beatrice stock at alow price) from KKR by arguing that he needed to offer themto clients as an inducement to buy the Beatrice junk bonds.Instead, Mr. Milken kept almost all the warrants for Drexel,lodging the bulk of them in his and his family'spartnerships. The warrants eventually proved to be worth anestimated $650 million.   Mr. Milken's Beverly Hills colleagues believed they wereall sharing in the profits generated by the high-yielddepartment, both in their bonuses and through interests ininvestment partnerships set up by Mr. Milken. Mr. Milkenrefused, however, to give details of the partnerships. Oneday, Gary Winnick called Jim Dahl into his office and said,&quot;I'm going to show you something that will make you sick.&quot;Mr. Winnick had gotten a master list of the partnerships. Itshowed that while most Milken deputies had an account, therewere more than 40 accounts for Mr. Milken, his wife, hischildren and other relatives. In total, Mr. Milken hadcreated more than 500 investment partnerships. One of them,named Otter Creek, paid out an astounding total of $473.4million, most of it to Mr. Milken and his family members. Andthat was just one of the partnerships.   But no amount of money, legal or illegal, seemed to beenough for Mr. Milken. At the end of 1986, Drexel allocated$700 million in bonus payments to Mr. Milken's high-yielddepartment. Under his arrangement with Drexel, Mr. Milken wasfree to allocate those payments to himself and hiscolleagues. Most of his employees thought Mr. Milken wasgenerous with them. They had no way of knowing that thatyear, Mr. Milken kept $550 million -- nearly 80% of the total-- for himself.   Even that wasn't enough. The year before, Mr. Milken feltthat Drexel Chief Executive Fred Joseph had cheated him on afinder's fee. Mr. Milken agreed that another department alsodeserved credit, but argued that his personal contact withthe client had locked up the deal. Mr. Joseph disagreed andrefused to give Mr. Milken the money. He thought the matterwas over. But now, a year later, Mr. Milken again complainedabout the fee. He called Mr. Joseph repeatedly, arguingstrenuously for hours about this one fee. In a year when hehad just made $550 million (not counting the Beatricewarrants and other earnings), and when a conservativeestimate of his net worth and that of his family would be $3billion, Mr. Milken never stopped griping that he had beencheated. The amount in dispute: $15,000.                                                                                                                             BEFORE THE FALL                                                                                                          As he careened from triumph to triumph, Mr. Milken seemedto change. He had always eaten lunch on paper plates outamong his colleagues, but by 1986 he was telling caterers toserve him on china and he often ate alone. He obtained anexpensive new toupee, began wearing French-cuffed shirts,bought a half-interest in a Gulfstream jet, hired a bodyguardand began arriving for work in a chauffeured limousine.   Still, by the standards of clients like Mr. Boesky, Mr.Milken was an ascetic. In the summer of 1986 Mr. Boesky washardly ever in his office. He was often in Europe at hisplace on France's Cote d'Azur. Other times he was at his $1.2million Paris apartment, his London apartment, his condo inHawaii, or in his own suite at the Beverly Hills Hotel.   But even Mr. Boesky outdid himself one Saturday inSeptember 1986. The Queen Elizabeth II had just leftManhattan on a celebratory &quot;cruise to nowhere&quot; for the barmitzvah of real estate developer Gerald Guterman's son. TheQE II's entire staff of more than 1,000 had been hired. PeterDuchin and his orchestra were playing. Clowns entertained onboard. Suddenly, guests began craning their necks skyward asa twin-engine helicopter hovered over the ship and landed onits helipad. With the blades still turning overhead, anelegantly clad Mr. Boesky, dressed in black tie, flashed asmile as he disembarked to laughter and applause.   The helicopter was owned by Mr. Boesky's friend Mr.Mulheren, and when the pilot reported to him, Mr. Mulherenwas furious. The next day he got on the phone to Mr. Boesky.   &quot;Don't ever use my helicopter again for a stunt likethis,&quot; Mr. Mulheren said. &quot;Are you out of your mind?Revolutions are made of this. People get put in gas ovens.&quot;   Mr. Boesky just chuckled. &quot;You've got to admit one thing,John. When I go, I go first class.&quot;   The next day, Sept. 17, 1986, Mr. Boesky surrendered tofederal authorities and became an undercover agent for theDepartment of Justice.                                                                                                                         WHEN A STRANGER CALLED                                                                                                          The call came early one October evening in 1986. MartinSiegel had left Kidder Peabody for Drexel, and had justreturned from his new office to his Upper East Sideapartment. &quot;Is this Marty Siegel?&quot; a voice on the phoneasked. After identifying himself only as Bill, the callerasked, &quot;Did you get my letter?&quot;   &quot;No,&quot; Mr. Siegel replied. &quot;I don't know anything about aletter.&quot; He thought he should just hang up, but somethingheld him. &quot;Why don't you tell me?&quot; Mr. Siegel asked.   Then the voice dropped its bombshell. &quot;I mean, yourrelationship with the Russian.&quot;   Mr. Siegel closed his eyes, only to see an image of Mr.Boesky -- the Russian. He struggled to sound unconcerned, buthe had to cut this off. &quot;Don't bother me anymore. If you do,I'll go to the police.&quot;   &quot;I doubt that,&quot; Bill replied sarcastically, and Mr. Siegelhung up.   He reeled away from his desk. &quot;So this is how it allends,&quot; he screamed. When his wife rushed in moments later,she found her husband slumped over the toilet in theadjoining bathroom, vomiting.   The next day, on the advice of his lawyer, LawrencePedowitz, Mr. Siegel drove to his Connecticut home where hefound the letter. It said simply, &quot;I know,&quot; and asked formoney to keep the writer from turning Mr. Siegel over to theInternal Revenue Service. The next week, Mr. Siegel got acurious call from Mr. Boesky anxiously seeking a meeting, andthen an IRS agent stopped by Mr. Siegel's office while he wasout. Mr. Siegel was growing increasingly unnerved.   So at Mr. Siegel's request, Mr. Pedowitz contacted theU.S. Attorney's office. Mr. Pedowitz summoned Mr. Siegel tohis office the next morning. &quot;The U.S. Attorney knows allabout the letter,&quot; he told Mr. Siegel. &quot;They know all aboutyou and Boesky.&quot; Mr. Siegel put his head in his hands andbegan to cry. &quot;I did this,&quot; he said.   He quickly agreed to cooperate with the government, whichwanted him to try to ensnare his former Kidder Peabodyarbitrage colleagues, Richard Wigton and Timothy Tabor.Investigator Thomas Doonan was assigned to work with Mr.Siegel in an undercover capacity. The two always met inperson, but one day Mr. Doonan called him on the phone forthe first time. Mr. Doonan's voice, isolated on the phone,sounded eerily familiar. Suddenly Mr. Siegel felt a chill. Hewas transported back to an October night, to his bedroom,where he had answered the phone.   &quot;Is this Marty Siegel?&quot; the voice had asked, ruining Mr.Siegel's life. &quot;Did you get my letter?&quot;   Mr. Doonan was &quot;Bill.&quot;                                                                                                                              THE COVER-UP                                                                                                          Mr. Milken and his traders were winding down a busy weekin Beverly Hills one Friday afternoon in November 1986 whensalesman Terren Peizer shouted, &quot;Oh, my God.&quot; Theelectrifying news of Ivan Boesky's guilty-plea arrangementhad just crossed the ticker.   All eyes turned to Mr. Milken. He showed no reaction.After three or four phone calls, he jumped up and headed forbrother Lowell's office, where he remained for more than anhour.   That weekend, Jim Dahl was summoned by Mr. Milken into theoffice. Mr. Milken walked silently into the men's room,turned on the tap water full blast and said, &quot;There haven'tbeen any subpoenas issued. Whatever you need to do, do it.&quot;   Cary Maultasch, Mr. Milken's representative in Drexel'sNew York office, was summoned as well, and booked a flightimmediately for Los Angeles. When he arrived, he was taken toMr. Milken. &quot;You don't know anything about the $5.3 millionpayment,&quot; Mr. Milken said flatly. But Mr. Maultasch did know.The payment was the money Mr. Boesky had owed Mr. Milken whenthey finally decided to settle the books on their illegaltrading arrangement. Mr. Maultasch was dismissed, but Mr.Milken scheduled another meeting with him for 4 a.m. the nextday.   When Mr. Maultasch arrived he was escorted into aconference room where Mr. Milken sat alone, a guard standingat the door. Mr. Milken spoke in hushed tones and frequentlywrote his questions on a yellow legal pad rather thanspeaking. He erased the questions once they were answered.The questions all concerned the illegal arrangement with Mr.Boesky, which Mr. Maultasch had helped Mr. Milken track.   When Mr. Milken wanted to discuss a specific stock, heused his pen to point at the stock's name on a list, nevermentioning the name aloud. When Mr. Maultasch left theoffice, he returned his entry pass to a Drexel security guardwho tore it up. &quot;Don't worry,&quot; the guard said. &quot;You weren'there.&quot;   Later, even after Mr. Milken had received his subpoenas,Mr. Milken sat down next to Mr. Peizer, the salesman, as Mr.Peizer was going through his files. &quot;What are you doing?&quot; Mr.Milken asked. &quot;Complying with a subpoena,&quot; Mr. Peizerresponded. Mr. Milken opened his own file drawers. They wereempty. &quot;If you don't have any documents,&quot; Mr. Milken said,&quot;you can't comply.&quot;   Mr. Milken's defense strategy was set at the outset bylead counsel Edward Bennett Williams, the famed Washingtoncriminal lawyer: &quot;We have to remain on the inside {of thetent} pissing out.&quot; Potential witnesses had to stay loyal toMr. Milken. To bring this about, Mr. Milken's lawyers foundother lawyers to represent potential witnesses whosecooperation they thought they could count on. Thus, a keypotential witness like Mr. Dahl ended up retaining Mr.Milken's own firm, Williams andamp; Connolly.   Even though Drexel was paying Mr. Milken's legal fees, theMilken defense team, which also included noted New Yorklawyer Arthur Liman, decided not to cooperate with Drexel andits lawyers even while saying publicly that they were workingtogether. Mr. Williams believed from the start that Drexelwould fold under the pressure of a massive governmentinvestigation. So Drexel's lawyers weren't allowed tointerrogate Mr. Milken, even though Drexel's chief executive,Mr. Joseph, sent them out to California to get to the bottomof the Boesky allegations. Most companies would fire souncooperative an employee, but Drexel did nothing. Thus, whenDrexel kept insisting publicly that it could find no evidenceof wrongdoing, it was hopelessly ill-informed.   Mr. Liman suggested that the Milken camp also retainpublic relations expert Linda Robinson, wife of AmericanExpress Co. Chairman James D. Robinson III, who had achievedprominence herself with numerous high-profile clients likeRJR Nabisco Chairman Ross Johnson. Her colleague, Ken Lerer,and some associates soon sat down with Mr. Milken to ask thefinancier what he considered his principal achievements. ThePR-staffers would then build their campaign around them. Mr.Milken took a legal pad and red flair pen and began to write,citing his achievements: that he won a dance contest inelementary school and was prom king in high school. Hestopped without mentioning Drexel. Some of the participantsrolled their eyes at the realization that portraying Mr.Milken as a national treasure would indeed be a toughassignment.   Mr. Lerer soon began placing pro-Milken tips with favoredjournalists, &quot;breast feeding&quot; them, as he once called it. TheRobinson firm began writing pro-Milken op-ed pieces that werethen signed by Milken clients. The whole effort wasenormously lucrative for the Robinson firm, which demanded a$150,000-a-month retainer and often exceeded it in actualbillings. The possibility that Mr. Milken might be guiltywasn't even allowed to be discussed inside the Robinson firm.One afternoon, employee David Gilman, who worked on theMilken account, was conferring with Mr. Lerer when Mrs.Robinson marched into Lerer's office and sprang what stafferscame to call the &quot;loyalty test.&quot;   &quot;Is Milken innocent or guilty?&quot; she demanded.   &quot;Innocent, of course,&quot; Mr. Gilman replied. Mrs. Robinsondidn't look satisfied, so he repeated, &quot;He is innocent,&quot; withmore conviction.   &quot;Right,&quot; Mrs. Robinson answered, then stalked out of theroom.                                                                                                                           THE TENT BLOWS OPEN                                                                                                          Two big breaks for the prosecutors helped topple thestrenuous defense efforts of Mr. Milken's handlers.Prosecutors working on the Robert Freeman case had gatheredrecords of a New Jersey firm called Princeton-Newport thathad done business with Mr. Freeman and Goldman Sachs. Theyfound some suspicious trading by one employee, whom they thenlearned had been fired. The former employee, Will Hale, wassubpoenaed and questioned. The interrogation was gettingnowhere. Mr. Hale was evasive and reluctant. Then prosecutorsasked what seemed an innocuous question: Why did he leavePrinceton-Newport? Mr. Hale hesitated only slightly beforeanswering, &quot;I didn't leave. I was fired.&quot; Why? he was asked.&quot;I couldn't stand all the crimes they were committing.&quot;   Mr. Hale detailed a series of securities crimes and saidPrinceton-Newport's principal conspirator was none other thanthe Beverly Hills office of Drexel Burnham Lambert.Prosecutors went on to seize audio phone tapes thatimplicated several Drexel employees, including Milken aideCary Maultasch, who, learning he was under suspicion, soondismissed his attorney out of fear that he was &quot;in Milken'spocket.&quot; Mr. Maultasch began negotiations with the U.S.Attorney's office and became a cooperating witness.   Another major break came soon after Milken aide Jim Dahlwas notified he was about to be indicted. All along, Mr. Dahlhad known he had something to hide. At Mr. Milken'sdirection, he had helped client Columbia Savings andamp; Loan evadetaxes through phony trades. Now Mr. Dahl began to questionthe loyalty of his lawyer, Robert Litt, whose firm alsorepresented Mr. Milken. Mr. Dahl requested a new lawyer, butwhen he came to believe that Mr. Litt was stalling, he hiredtwo new lawyers of his own.   When Mr. Dahl's new defense team examined the evidenceagainst him, Mr. Dahl was relieved: The suspicious tradesbeing examined by the government had his initials on theorder tickets, but he hadn't done them. One of the tradingtickets actually had the initials M.M. at the bottom. Herecognized the orders as trades in stocks for Ivan Boesky.Mr. Dahl only handled bonds, and knew that Mr. Milken himselfhandled Mr. Boesky's trades.   Mr. Dahl immediately went to his old lawyer, Mr. Litt,still working for Mr. Milken, and told him &quot;I didn't do thetrades, Mike did.&quot; Would Mr. Milken sign an affidavit thatMr. Dahl didn't do the trades? A week later the answer came:Mr. Milken wouldn't sign or acknowledge anything. Mr. Dahl'sown trading assistant, still on Mr. Milken's payroll, saidshe suffered a memory lapse; she didn't remember anythingabout the trades, so she couldn't back up Mr. Dahl. Soon, Mr.Dahl was convinced that he was becoming a fall guy for Mr.Milken. His lawyers approached the U.S. Attorney's office andasked for immunity. The &quot;tent&quot; so carefully erected had blownopen.   Several other Drexel aides would soon follow Mr. Dahl intothe government camp. Even as his lawyers claimed thedefections didn't matter, the news hit Mr. Milken hard. Aftertestifying before a grand jury, Mr. Dahl was in New York whenhe received a call from Mr. Milken. He was in Washington, andif Mr. Dahl met him there, the two could fly back to LosAngeles together in Mr. Milken's plane. Mr. Dahl, eager for areconciliation with his mentor, accepted. But as the flightstarted, Mr. Milken said virtually nothing to Mr. Dahl. Hethen selected a movie, &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark,&quot; and turnedup the sound so loud that Mr. Dahl's ears hurt.   &quot;Mike, if we're not going to talk, will you at least turnthat thing down?&quot; Mr. Dahl asked. But Mr. Milken didn'trespond. He didn't even look at Mr. Dahl, nor did he speak tohim for the duration of the flight. The message sank in. ToMr. Milken, Mr. Dahl had ceased to exist.                                                                                                                           ADMISSION OF GUILT                                                                                                          By late 1988, having heard the Princeton-Newport tapes andother evidence, Chief Executive Fred Joseph had ceased tobelieve in Mr. Milken's innocence. That meant Drexel wasguilty, too. Mr. Joseph traveled to the office of Mr.Milken's lead attorney, Arthur Liman (Mr. Williams havingdied that summer), to explain his painful decision to havethe firm plead guilty and dismiss Mr. Milken. He was shockedat the reception he received.   Mr. Liman compared Mr. Joseph's decision to the Nazipersecution of Jews. He argued that Mr. Joseph was deprivingMr. Milken of his rights prior to trial. &quot;That's the firststep towards concentration camps,&quot; Mr. Liman said. &quot;No mancan deprive another of his freedoms.&quot; Mr. Joseph was tooshocked to counter Mr. Liman's charges, but he insisted hismind was made up. &quot;Mike did what he did,&quot; Mr. Joseph said.&quot;I'm not here to try Michael Milken.&quot; Almost as anafterthought, he added, &quot;Mike is going to plead guiltyanyway.&quot;   This really aroused Mr. Liman's indignation. &quot;Never,&quot; hesaid firmly, showing Mr. Joseph to the door. &quot;Absolutelynot.&quot;   Mr. Joseph's next stop was Milken partisan Donald Engel,the man behind Drexel's infamous Predator's Balls.Immediately after Mr. Joseph left his office, Mr. Limanplaced a call to Mr. Engel. &quot;Donny, he's selling him out,&quot;Mr. Liman reported. So Mr. Engel was ready for a fight whenMr. Joseph arrived at his apartment.   Mr. Milken is &quot;our brother,&quot; Mr. Engel insisted. &quot;You'vegot to fight. A mafia lawyer wouldn't act like this.&quot;   &quot;We're not a mafia company,&quot; a weary Mr. Joseph replied.                                                                                                                                THE FALL                                                                                                          Despite the Milken team's repeated denials, pleabargaining was soon under way. By March of 1989, prosecutorshad put an offer on the table for Mr. Milken: plead guilty tojust two felonies in return for immunity for his brotherLowell. Their deadline for a response was 3 p.m., March 29.That afternoon, prosecutors gathered in their office to awaitthe call from Mr. Milken's forces. The grand jury was waitingnearby in the courthouse. Expecting their client to pleadguilty, Williams andamp; Connolly's Mr. Litt had planned a trip toDisney World and Mr. Liman was planning to go to France thatvery day. But as the day wore on, Mr. Milken hadn't decided.He wasn't even taking calls from his own lawyers. Finally,Mr. Litt got through to Mr. Milken. &quot;I can't decide,&quot; Mr.Milken said. &quot;I've got these concerns. . . .&quot;   The deadline passed without a response from Mr. Milken.Still, the government waited. A press conference to announcethe indictment was scheduled for 4 p.m., then canceled.Finally, a breathless Mr. Liman reached acting U.S. AttorneyBenito Romano from a pay phone at New York's KennedyInternational Airport and said, &quot;He's ready to reach anagreement.&quot;   &quot;I'm sorry,&quot; Mr. Romano responded after a brief pause.&quot;It's too late.&quot;   Mr. Milken had made his worst trade ever. He was indictedthat day on 98 counts. He later pleaded innocent and assertedpublicly for a year that he would be acquitted. Butprosecutors had the advantage all along of knowing what thepublic didn't -- that Mr. Milken had already admitted guilt.   Mr. Milken's guilty plea, this time to six felonies, camea full year later. On Nov. 21, 1990, federal district courtJudge Kimba Wood sentenced Mr. Milken to 10 years in prison-- two years each on five of the six counts, with thesentences to run consecutively.   Many in the courtroom gasped as the sentence was read, butMr. Milken showed no reaction. When the Milken entourage hadgathered in the corridor outside, the heavy door to thecourtroom was closed. Mr. Milken had still said nothing. Thenhe turned to Mr. Liman. &quot;How much did I get?&quot; he asked, as ifhe hadn't heard Judge Wood. &quot;Two years?&quot;   There was a moment of stunned silence. Apparently Mr.Milken thought he was being sentenced to concurrent ratherthan consecutive sentences. Mr. Liman broke the news. &quot;Tenyears, Michael,&quot; he said gently. &quot;The sentence is 10 years.&quot;   The blood drained from Mr. Milken's face. He took his wifeLori's arm and the two disappeared into a small witness'swaiting room off the corridor, closing the door behind them.   Moments later, first Lori, then Mr. Milken, emittedbloodcurdling screams. Milken lawyer Richard Sandler burstinto the room as Mr. Milken collapsed into a chair,hyperventilating. &quot;Oxygen]&quot; someone yelled, as a federalmarshal raced for help.   ---                    Chronology of Events                                                                                                          May 1986         The Securities and Exchange Commission                    and federal prosecutors accuse Dennis                    Levine of making $12.6 million in                    insider-trading profits.

The one major exception occurs between Mr. Milken'sassertions of fact, and Mr. Boesky's. The reporting foundthat Mr. Boesky's version was consistently more accurate.After making his plea agreement, Mr. Boesky's only obligationwas to tell the truth; indeed, his plea bargain would berevoked if he lied.   In contrast -- and in striking departure from usualJustice Department practice -- Mr. Milken's plea bargainisn't revocable even if he now lies. He didn't testify underoath, even at his presentencing hearing when given theopportunity to do so, and during the investigation herepeatedly invoked the Fifth Amendment.   Nonetheless, the following is an effort to convey Mr.Milken's position, largely set forth in court filingsresponding to government charges, as well as the positions ofothers who dispute aspects of this story.   Diamond Shamrock: Mr. Milken has repeatedly deniedengaging in insider trading. He has insisted that hecommitted no crimes other than the six to which he pleadedguilty. When given the opportunity to respond to allegationsof insider trading in Diamond Shamrock and other stocks, hislawyers said only that if Mr. Milken had been routinelyinsider trading with Mr. Boesky, Mr. Boesky wouldn't haveneeded to trade illegally with Dennis Levine.   Mr. Milken's Fainting Spell: Lowell Milken's attorney sayshis client attended to his brother and called an ambulancefor him.   The Siegel/Freeman scheme: Mr. Freeman has denied engagingin any criminal activity other than the one instance ofinsider trading with Mr. Siegel to which he pleaded guilty.Mr. Freeman has apparently denied other specific allegedinstances in a presentencing memorandum, but at his request,this document has been sealed. The Wall Street Journal hasfiled suit to obtain the report; the litigation is pending.   MCA/Golden Nugget: This was the subject of Count Three ofMr. Milken's plea agreement. But while admitting crime, Mr.Milken has insisted that the subsequent purchasers of MCAstock were victims only of Mr. Boesky's rush to sell, not oftheir mutual scheme.   Pacific Lumber: In response to these allegations, Mr.Milken's lawers said, &quot;It is obviously impossible for us torefute . . . each and every transaction which Boesky nowclaims was tainted with illegality.&quot;   Liman/Joseph discussions: While acknowledging having awide-ranging philosophical discussion, Mr. Liman has deniedcomparing Mr. Joseph to the Nazis.   -- James B.
