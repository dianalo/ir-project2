Small-business groups generally haven't taken publicpositions on Supreme Court choices in the past. But theconservative views of President Bush's nominee to the highcourt have spurred the biggest small-business group, theNational Federation of Independent Business, to weigh anendorsement. It is researching Judge Thomas's record onbusiness issues to decide whether it should actively supporta Supreme Court nomination for the first time in its 48-yearhistory.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Some of the individual-freedom views he holds would callinto question some labor-management decisions past courtshave reached and affect the minimum-wage issue,&quot; says JohnMotley, the group's top lobbyist. &quot;If that's true, itprovides one of the strongest arguments I've seen in a longtime for the small business community to get involved&quot; in ahigh-court nomination.   Even before Judge Thomas's nomination, the group had beenconsidering getting more involved in legal matters as theincreasingly conservative federal courts turn more friendlyto business views. &quot;Small business has been reluctant to usethe courts in the past primarily because all the decisionswere coming down the other way,&quot; Mr. Motley says. No decisionhas been made on whether to back Judge Thomas.   Meanwhile, small-business lobbyists hope that Sen. JohnDanforth's support of Judge Thomas, a former aide to theMissouri Republican, will help the senator forge a compromisewith President Bush on a civil-rights bill, says John Galles,executive vice president of National Small Business United.Small-business groups oppose the legal-damages provisions ofthe bill, which the House has passed.   Mr. Galles says the small-business lobby hopes for acompromise &quot;that uses arbitration instead of litigation tosolve discrimination problems.&quot;   ---   CONGRESS MOVES quickly on microloans to low-incomeentrepreneurs.   Prospects for fast approval are good for a Senate bill topermit the Small Business Administration to lend poor peopleup to $15,000 to start a business. The bill was only recentlyintroduced by Sen. Dale Bumpers (D., Ark.), who heads theSenate Small Business Committee. But the SenateAppropriations Committee already has agreed to reserve about$28 million in this year's funding bill to pay for the loansand the technical aid to go with them. Several House membersare interested in sponsoring companion legislation.   Under the Bumpers bill, the SBA could lend a communityorganization as much as $750,000 at the same interest ratethe Treasury pays to borrow money (currently about 7%), andthe community groups would then make loans to individuals atabout four points above the banks' prime rate. About 35 pilotprograms are expected to be funded around the country under afive-year demonstration program, beginning next year. Stateswith successful similar programs of their own will be amongthe first participants. Under a Minnesota program, LeslieJohnson started the Flower Hut in St. Paul in 1985 with a$500 loan from the Women's Economic Development Corp. and nowhas three stores that gross about $750,000 annually.   One worry: The bill's sponsors say they must make surethat getting a microloan wouldn't cancel out welfare benefitsfor loan recipients.   ---   JUST SAY SBA: Drug-control information and research willbecome a new focus for the Small Business Administration. TheSBA is expected to become a formal ally of the Office ofNational Drug Control Policy, headed by drug czar BobMartinez. The SBA will focus on disseminating information tosmall employers, but won't get involved in running drugprevention or control programs. During congressional hearingslast March, Rep. Ron Wyden (D., Ore.), chairman of a Housesmall-business subcommittee, criticized SBA andadministration officials for failing to include thesmall-business workplace in President Bush's anti-drugefforts.   ---   PENSION TENSION: Two pension-simplification billsintroduced recently in Congress would make the popular 401-Kretirement-savings plan cheaper for small firms to offer. Thebills also include administration proposals that would letmore small employers set up individual retirement accountsfor workers. But Paula Calimafde, president of the SmallBusiness Council of America, which represents about 1,000small companies on tax matters, endorses only the 401-Kproposal, not the special IRAs. Other groups, including theNational Federation of Independent Business, support theproposed bills, but would prefer new incentives toindividuals to save for retirement themselves, rather thanthrough a company plan.   ---   DEADBEATS, BEWARE: SBA staffers are trained to usedebt-collection law.   Small Business Administration litigators are the first tobe instructed by the Justice Department to enforce changesmade last year to the Federal Crime Control Act. Under newrules, the government can pursue defaulters nationwidewithout transferring cases to another judicial district; canfreeze real estate and other assets until a case iscompleted; and can more easily garnishee wages. Before thenew rules were adopted, federal prosecutors had to pursuedefaulters through state laws.   &quot;It's just fundamentally fair: If you borrow from thefederal government, you pay back under federal law,&quot; saysCharles Larson, U.S. attorney for the northern district ofIowa. Mr. Larson led training sessions with SBA staffers inDenver last month to teach them how to pursue those whodefault on the agency's loans. &quot;The SBA is a major client ofours; they have major debts to recover,&quot; he says.   The SBA has $1.1 billion in delinquent guaranteed loans,or 6.3% of all delinquent funds owed Uncle Sam. About $400million of SBA direct loans are delinquent, or 3.4% of allfederal delinquent loans.   ---   SMALL TALK: The SBA and the National Institute ofStandards and Technology plan to set up pilot programs atfive Small Business Development Centers to give small firmsaccess to computerized data on technology-transferopportunities from the government. . . . Will small-businessexporters run into a bureaucratic maze if they contactfederal agencies for help? To test the theory, staffers forthe accounting firm KPMG Peat Marwick sought information onthe Support for Eastern European Democracy Act. After manyfruitless inquiries, an Agency for International Developmentbureaucrat told them the program is mainly for the MiddleEast.</TEXT></DOC>
