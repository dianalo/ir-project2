The Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policyfor the central bank, voted 9-2 at a meeting on May 17 to tightencredit conditions slightly in the weeks following the meeting.   The two dissenters, Lee Hoskins, president of the FederalReserve Bank of Cleveland, and Robert Parry, president of theFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, argued that a moresubstantial tightening move was needed to dampen inflationarypressures.   Fed policy-makers met again on Wednesday and Thursday of thisweek and many analysts believe the central bank discussed boostingits discount rate, the interest it charges to make bank loans.   An increase in the discount rate, which was last raised inSeptember, is the strongest signal the central bank can send of itsintention to push interest rates higher.   The minutes of the May meeting confirmed what many analysts hadalready suspected, that the Fed moved in late May to tighten creditconditions because of concerns that the economy was growing so fastin the first part of the year that it was putting severe pressureson prices and wages.   The last tightening move followed two earlier moves to pushinterest rates higher in late March and in early May. The centralbank's goal was to restrain credit and thereby restrain overalldemand in the economy.   It accomplished this objective by restricting slightly theamount of money that banks have available to make loans, thuspushing up the price of that money _ interest rates.   A variety of interest rates, including the bank prime lendingrate, and mortgage rates, did move higher in the spring, partly asa result of the Fed's tightening moves.   The minutes of the May meeting showed that Fed officialsremained concerned about the rate of economic growth.   ``The members generally agreed that some further tightening ofreserve conditions was needed to counter the risks of risinginflationary pressures in the economy,'' the minutes said. ``Afailure to act in a timely fashion not only would be inconsistentwith the committee's commitment to achieving price stability overtime but would in fact compound the difficulties of accomplishingthat objective.''   The two dissenters argued that the central bank should be doingmore than the small tightening steps it was contemplating.   Hoskins and Parry argued that ``the risks were considerable thatprice and wage inflation would accelerate from rates that werealready too high.'' They said unless the Fed did more it ran therisk that it would have to drive interest rates up even moresharply later in the year to get inflation under control.   The minutes said that Parry argued that the two tightening movesthat had occurred in the weeks prior to the meeting were of``insufficient magnitude to have much effect on the economy.''   Many economists are looking for a boost in the discount ratebefore the end of the month to 6.5 percent from the current 6percent. They believe the Fed will be forced to act to keep thisrate in line with other rates, which have been pushed higher.   They argue that the Fed will hike the discount rate now ratherthan run the risk that an increase later would become an issue inthe presidential campaign.   The FOMC, made up of the Fed governors and presidents of six ofthe Fed's regional banks, also reviewed monetary policy through thefirst half of the year to decide whether any changes were needed inthe monetary growth targets.   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan will reveal the resultsof those deliberations when he testifies before the Senate BankingCommittee on July 13.</TEXT></DOC>
