The FMP differentiatesbetween species with numerical and non-numerical optimum yields (OYs).A species that may be harvested fairly selectively has a numerical OY whichis the maximum amount of that species that may be retained or landed eachyear in the fishery management area or relevant subarea, and includes fishcaught in the territorial sea (0-3 nautical miles). However, there is anexception for small incidental allowances in the foreign and joint venturefisheries which are not included in the OY. Landings in excess of OY areprohibited. Widow rockfish (<T3>Sebastes entomelas</T3>), Pacific ocean perch (<T3>S. alutus</T3>), and sablefish (<T3>Anoplopoma fimbria</T3>) are three of the six species in the FMP whichhave numerical OYs. When landing rates for these species have resultedin projections that quotas would be achieved before the end of the year,trip limits have been imposed or adjusted: (1) To extend the fishery aslong as possible throughout the year, and (2) to allow catches taken unavoidablywhile fishing for other species (incidental catches) to be landed to minimizethe waste of fish which otherwise must be discarded once an OY quota isreached. A trip limit is the total allowable amount of a groundfish speciesor species complex, by weight or by percentage of weight of fish on board,which may be landed from a single fishing trip. Limits on the frequencyof landings of trip limits (trip frequency limits) also are used to slowthe rate of landings. By slowing the fishery and avoiding premature closurewhich must occur when a quota is reached, the discarding of incidentalcatches is minimized and the likelihood of biological stress from fishingabove the OY is lessened.Species which are not harvested selectively, or for which there is verylittle commercial interest or scientific data, are part of the non-numericalOY group and are managed most commonly by gear, area, and landing restrictions(trip limits and trip frequency limits). An estimate of the acceptablebiological catch (ABC), the annual catch that could be taken without jeopardizingthe resource's productivity, has been made for all species in this group,individually or combined with other species for the 1989 fishing seasonin a separate notice. An ABC (as defined at andSection; 663.2) is an estimatethat is seasonally determined, and may differ from maximum sustainableyield (MSY) for biological reasons. ABC estimates also are made for allspecies with numerical OYs. If one or more species in the group is biologicallystressed, or is expected to become stressed if no limits on fishing areset, the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) may determine that the harvestof species that are unavoidably caught together should be reduced, eventhough some of those species are not stressed. Reducing the harvest rateon these aggregated species usually has been accomplished by establishinga ``harvest guideline'' for the group as a whole and setting trip limitsto achieve this harvest level. The harvest guideline may be, but is notnecessarily, designated as a quota.The regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR Part 663 allow the Secretaryto reduce fishing levels if it is determined that continued fishing atcurrent levels would cause biological stress to any species. The PacificFishery Management Council (Council) has endorsed the determination ofits Groundfish Management Team (GMT) that if landings of widow rockfish,yellowtail rockfish (included in the <T3>Sebastes</T3> complex of rockfish), Pacific ocean perch, and sablefishare unrestricted, the likelihood or intensity of biological stress on thosestocks is increased. Pacific ocean perch is considered to be under long-termstress and is managed under a rebuilding schedule. Landings of widow rockfish,Pacific ocean perch, and sablefish have been limited since the FMP wasimplemented in 1982 to minimize stress, or its likelihood, on these stocks;similarly, landings of the <T3>Sebastes</T3> complex have been restricted since 1983.In its deliberations for 1989 management, the Council considered advicefrom the GMT (state and Federal fishery and social scientists), GroundfishAdvisory Subpanel (fishing industry and consumer representatives), theconcerned public, and a Select Group created by the Council for the purposeof recommending methods of limiting landings with minimal disruption tothe fishing industry. The Select Group included representatives from thefishing industry, the Council, the Scientific and Statistical Committee,and the GMT.At its November 16-17, 1988 meeting in Portland, Oregon, the Council reviewedthe latest data and developed management measures intended to limit landingsof groundfish in 1989, thereby minimizing the likelihood or intensity ofbiological stress on groundfish stocks, and reducing the chances of havingto close a fishery before the end of the year. In each case, the Councilrecommended a trip limit. As in 1988 the Council also recommended allocationof the sablefish resource between the trawl and nontrawl (predominantlyfixed gear) user groups. The Council's recommendations for 1989 and actionstaken by the Secretary on those recommendations are presented below.Because the vast majority of groundfish caught off Washington, Oregon,and California is taken from the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) which extendsfrom 3 to 200 nautical miles offshore, management of the groundfish fisheryhas been applied from 0-200 nautical miles. All groundfish taken and retained,possessed, or landed in or offshore (0-200 nautical miles) of Washington,Oregon, and California are subject to these restrictions.<ITAG tagnum="84">Widow Rockfish</ITAG><T3>Council Recommendation:</T3> The Council recommended a coast-wide triplimit of 30,000 pounds of widow rockfish, with only one landing above 3,000pounds per vessel per week, the same limit imposed in January 1988.<T3>Rationale</T3>: The widow rockfish resource is believed to be at orabove population levels which produce the MSY, an average over a reasonablelength of time of the largest catch which can be taken continuously froma stock. If not curtailed, landings could be at least as high as the highestcatch on record, about 27,700 metric tons (mt), above the average MSY of9,500 mt, and clearly increasing the likelihood of biological stress onthe stock.Trip limits have been used to limit landings of widow rockfish since 1982.In 1988 as in 1987, the year started with a 30,000-pound weekly trip limitand landings less than 3,000 pounds were exempt from the one landing perweek provision. At its July 1988 meeting, the Council recommended thata 3,000 pound trip limit (with no frequency restriction) be imposed onthe date necessary to assure that the 12,100 mt OY would not be reachedbefore the end of the year (53 FR 29480, August 5, 1988). The 3,000 poundlimit was intended to discourage target fishing while allowing incidentalcatches to be landed. This incidental limit was implemented on September21, 1988 (53 FR 36793, September 22, 1988). The best available informationat the November Council meeting indicated that the OY for widow rockfishwould not be reached in 1988.The widow rockfish OY in 1989 is 12,400 mt, 2.5 percent higher than the12,100 mt OY in 1988. As in part years, the rate of landings must be restrictedin 1989 to minimize the probability of biological stress on the stock andto extend the fishery longer than otherwise would be possible. If thiswere not done, the OY quota could be reached early in the year, possiblyby mid-summer, resulting in incidental catch and discards which would exceedOY and contribute to the likelihood of biological stress on the resource.<T3>Secretarial Action:</T3> The Secretary concurs with the Council's recommendationand herein announces:(1) No more than 30,000 pounds (round weight) of widow rockfish may betaken and retained, possessed, or landed per vessel per fishing trip ina one-week period. Only one landing of widow rockfish above 3,000 pounds(round weight) may be made per vessel in that one-week period. ``One-weekperiod'' means seven consecutive days beginning 0001 hours Wednesday andending 2400 hours Tuesday, local time.(2) Unless retention or landing of widow rockfish has been prohibited,a vessel which has landed a weekly limit may continue to fish on the nextweek's limit so long as the fish are not landed (offloaded) until the followingweek.(3) Only one landing above 3,000 pounds of widow rockfish may be made duringthe period January 1-3, 1989. (4) The fishery management area for this species is the exclusive economiczone off the coasts of Washington, Oregon, and California between 3 and200 nautical miles offshore, and bounded on the north by the ProvisionalInternational Boundary between the United States and Canada, and boundedon the south by the International Boundary between the United States andMexico. However, all widow rockfish possessed 0-200 nautical miles offshore,or landed in, Washington, Oregon, or California are presumed to have beentaken and retained from 0-200 nautical miles offshore Washington, Oregon,or California unless otherwise demonstrated by the person in possessionof those fish. <ITAG tagnum="84">Sebastes Complex </ITAG><T3>Council Recommendation: </T3>The Council recommended that the harvestguideline for the <T3>Sebastes </T3>complex, the sum of the ABCs of the species in the complexcaught north of Coos Bay, Oregon, be increased from 10,200 mt in 1988 to10,500 mt in 1989, reflecting the 300 mt increase to the ABC for yellowtailrockfish in that area. The Council also recommended that the trip limitfor the <T3>Sebastes </T3>complex as a whole remain at 25,000 pounds per week,the same as at the beginning of 1987 and 1988. However, because of difficultieskeeping landings of yellowtail rockfish within its ABC, the trip limitfor that species would be mantained at 7,500 pounds per week, 25 percentlower than during January-October, 1988. Only one landing above 3,000 poundsof the <T3>Sebastes</T3> complex would be allowed per vessel per week. The Wednesday-Tuesdaydefinition of ``week'' would remain in effect. Trip limit options woldbe continued so that fishermen may choose a biweekly limit (which allowslanding up to 50,000 pounds of the <T3>Sebastes </T3>complex, containing no more than 15,000 pounds of yellowtailrockfish, in one trip in a two-week period), or a twice-weekly limit (whichallows two landings up to 12,500 pounds each of the <T3>Sebastes </T3>complex, containing no more than 3,750 pounds of yellowtailrockfish each, in a one-week period). These options are available onlyif proper notification is given to the appropriate State authority. Asin the past, the number of landings less than 3,000 pounds for the <T3>Sebastes </T3>complex will not be restricted. The 40,000-pound trip limit for landings of the <T3>Sebastes </T3>complex caught south of Coos Bay, Oregon is continued,with no limit on the number of landings allowed per week. <T3>Rationale: </T3>The harvest guideline for the <T3>Sebastes </T3>complex of rockfish caught north of Coos Bay, Oregon(43anddegrees;21andmin172;34&quot; N. latitude) is the sum of the ABCs of the speciesin the complex, and has been relatively stable since 1984. Landings arenot necessarily prohibited when the harvest guideline is reached, althoughthe Council could do so. Yellowtail rockfish, a dominant component in the<T3>Sebastes </T3>complex in the Vancouver and Columbia subareas, was documentedas biologically stressed in March 1983 (48 FR 8283, February 28, 1983).Trip limits have been imposed since then in attempts to reduce the likelihoodof biological stress on this species. Because yellowtail rockfish frequentlyare caught with other species in the multispecies <T3>Sebastes </T3>complex, limits were placed on the complex as a whole.In 1988, weekly trip limits for the <T3>Sebastes </T3>complex caught north of Coos Bay were maintained at 25,000pounds all year, but landing limits for yellowtail rockfish were reducedfrom 10,000 pounds in January (53 FR 248, January 6, 1988) to 7,500 poundsin October (53 FR 39606, October 11, 1988). Biweekly and twice-weekly landingoptions were available. Landings of the <T3>Sebastes </T3>complex in 1988 are expected to exceed the 10,200 mtharvest guideline by about nine percent, an amount which was not consideredsignificant by the Council. However, landings of yellowtail rockfish areprojected to exceed the 3,600 mt ABC for the same area by about 60 percent.The biomass of yellowtail rockfish has been declining for the past twodecades although it appears to have stabilized in recent years. A comprehensiveassessment of this species was used to establish the ABC for 1989 at 4,300mt. The assessment also indicates the stock is near, and possibly above,the biomass level which will produce the MSY. As a result of this assessment,the ABC for yellowtail rockfish was increased by 300 mt in the Columbiaarea. Consequently, the 1989 harvest guideline for the <T3>Sebastes </T3>complex north of Coos Bay also was increased by 300 mt,from 10,200 mt to 10,500 mt, to incorporate the increase in the ABC foryellowtail rockfish. The GMT believes the likelihood of biological stress on the yellowtailrockfish resource would be greatly increased if management measures werenot imposed to slow the fishery in 1989. Record high landings reached 9,742mt in the Vancouver and Columbia areas in 1983, when restrictions wereplaced only on the <T3>Sebastes </T3>complex as a whole. If not restricted, landings of yellowtailrockfish could reach this level in 1989, almost 2.5 times the ABC, whichwould drive the stock below the biomass needed to produce MSY within oneyear and clearly increase the likelihood of biological stress on yellowtailrockfish. Accordingly, trip limits for yellowtail rockfish imposed at thebeginning of 1989 are 25 percent lower than those in effect between Januaryand October 1988, and may be adjusted during the year to keep landingsclose to the 1989 harvest guideline for the <T3>Sebastes </T3>complex and ABC for yellowtail rockfish north of CoosBay. As in past years, landings south of Coos Bay are limited to discouragelarge effort shifts into that area without impeding traditional operations.Accordingly, the 40,000-pound trip limit for the <T3>Sebastes </T3>complex caught south of Coos Bay is maintained as in1987 and 1988. <T3>Secretarial Action: </T3>The Secretary concurs with the Council's recommendationsand herein announces_ (1) Definitions.

In this event, the provisions in paragraph (3) for the <T3>Sebastes</T3> complex caught north of Coos Bay will apply to all ofthe <T3>Sebastes</T3> complex taken in that trip, no matter where the fishare caught.<ITAG tagnum="84">Pacific Ocean Perch</ITAG><T3>Council Recommendation:</T3> The Council recommended continuation ofthe coast-wide management measures in place in 1987 and 1988. If more than1,000 pounds of Pacific ocean perch are on board, the trip limit for thatspecies is 20 percent (by weight) of all legal fish on board or 5,000 pounds,whichever is less. However, landings of Pacific ocean perch of 1,000 poundsor less per trip are unrestricted, regardless of the percentage on board.<T3>Rationale:</T3> Pacific ocean perch is considered to be under long-termstress and has been managed for 9 years under a 20-year rebuilding scheduleintended to increase the stock to levels that will produce the MSY. Triplimits have been imposed since the FMP became effective in 1982. The mostrecent assessment, conducted in 1987, indicated that recruitment is improvingbut at relatively low levels, and data from the commercial fishery didnot indicate any particularly strong year classes entering the fishery.Significant rebuilding of this species probably will not occur until oneor more strong year classes recruit to the stock. Even if no Pacific oceanperch were harvested in 1989, the desired 20-year rebuilding rate probablywould not be met. However, incidental catches of this species in otherfisheries are unavoidable, and the trip limits (and OY estimates) are designedto accommodate only these small incidental catches.Landings of Pacific ocean perch in 1988 are expected to be below the 500mt OY for the Vancouver subarea (47anddegrees;30andmin16; N. latitude to theCanadian border) and below the 800 mt OY for the Columbia subarea (43anddegrees;00andmin172;to 47anddegrees;30andmin172; N. latitude). By maintaining the same OYs andtrip limits in 1989 as in 1988 (53 FR 248, January 6, 1988) and 1987 (52FR 790, January 9, 1987), the maximum opportunity for rebuilding will occur,short of prohibiting fishing for all species in the Vancouver and Columbiasubareas.The trip limit is designed to eliminate target fishing for Pacific oceanperch in these two northern subareas, and is applied coast-wide to discouragethose who would exceed the limit and allege the fish were caught legallyelsewhere. Because Pacific ocean perch are not abundant south of the Columbiasubarea, this trip limit is not expected to restrict fisheries there.<T3>Secretarial Action:</T3> The Secretary concurs with the Council's recommendationand herein announces_(1) For Pacific ocean perch coast-wide (Washington, Oregon, and California),no more than 5,000 pounds or 20 percent (round weights) of all legal fishon board, whichever is less, may be taken and retained, possessed, or landedper vessel per fishing trip. This provision applies only when more than1,000 pounds (round weight) of Pacific ocean perch are onboard.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note.</T4>_Twenty percent of all legal fish on board including Pacificocean perch is equivalent to 25 percent of all legal fish on board otherthan Pacific ocean perch.</ITAG>(2) Legal fish means groundfish taken and retained, possessed, or landedin accordance with the provisions of 50 CFR Part 663, the Magnuson Act,any notice issued under subpart B of Part 663, or any other regulationor permit promulgated under the Magnuson Act.(3) The fishery management area for this species is the exclusive economiczone off the coasts of Washington, Oregon, and California between 3 and200 nautical miles offshore, and bounded on the north by the ProvisionalInternational Boundary between the United States and Canada, and boundedon the south by the International Boundary between the United States andMexico. However, this restriction applies to all Pacific ocean perch takenand retained between 0 and 200 nautical miles offshore of Washington, Oregon,or California. All Pacific ocean perch possessed 0-200 nautical miles offshore,or landed in, Washington, Oregon, or California are presumed to have beentaken and retained from 0-200 nautical miles offshore Washington, Oregon,or California unless otherwise demonstrated by the person in possessionof those fish.<ITAG tagnum="84">Sablefish</ITAG><T3>Council Recommendation:</T3> The Council recommended that the 1989sablefish fishery be managed to achieve a harvest of 10,400 mt, the lowend of an OY range of 10,400-11,000 mt. The Council also recommended that22 mt be subtracted from the 10,400 mt to accommodate the expected harvestof sablefish by the Makah Indian tribe of northern Washington. The remaining10,378 mt are to be allocated 52 percent (5,397 mt) for trawl gear and48 percent (4,981 mt) mt for nontrawl gear (predominantly pot and longlinefixed gears).Trip limits were recommended for both trawl and nontrawl fisheries to avoidreaching their respective allocations before the end of the year. The triplimit for trawl-caught sablefish, to be imposed January 1, 1989, is 1,000pounds or 45 percent (by weight) of the deepwater complex, whichever isgreater. The deepwater complex consists of sablefish, Dover sole (<T3>Microstomus pacificus</T3>), thornyheads (<T3>Sebastolobus</T3> spp.), and arrowtooth flounder (<T3>Atheresthes stomias</T3>). For the nontrawl fleet, a trip limit of100 pounds will be imposed later in the season, if needed, to extend thenontrawl allocation to the end of the year. All weights are round weightsor round weight equivalents. These limits will be applied coast-wide andmay be adjusted inseason.An additional 600 mt of sablefish are available by extending OY to be arange to accommodate uncertainties in landings projections, enable somesmall fisheries that operate later in the year to land small amounts ofsablefish after gear allocations have been reached, and allow for landingsof sablefish caught incidentally while fishing for other species. However,if total landings reach 11,000 mt, the upper end of the OY range, all furtherlandings of sablefish will be prohibited.The Council also recommended continuation of the coast-wide trip limitsfor sablefish smaller than 22 inches. For the trawl fleet operating underthe 1,000 pound landing restriction, all sablefish may be smaller than22 inches, and under the 45 percent deepwater complex limit, no more than5,000 pounds may be sablefish smaller than 22 inches. In the nontrawl fishery,no more than 1,500 pounds or three percent of all sablefish on board, whicheveris greater, may be sablefish smaller than 22 inches.<T3>Rationale:</T3> Two major gear groups harvest sablefish off Washington,Oregon, and California. The nontrawl or fixed gear fleet generally targetson sablefish with little bycatch. The trawl fleet catches sablefish jointlywith other species in its multispecies operations. Sablefish sometimesare the predominant species in a single haul, but the extent of targetingis not known. As catch and effort by both sectors have increased and OYhas declined, the Council has tried several allocation schemes to managethis fishery.Current regulations at 50 CFR 663.27(b)(3) require that the last 10 percentof the sablefish OY be allocated equally between trawl and fixed gears,designate these allocations as quotas beyond which landings are prohibited,and place a percentage trip limit on trawl landings to slow that fisherywhile enabling incidental catches to be landed. This regulation was notsuccessful in 1985 and has not been applied since 1986. In 1986, an emergencyrule was used to allocate a larger proportion of OY, and in 1987 and 1988,pursuant to 663.22(a)(3), the entire OY was allocated between trawl andnontrawl gears.In 1988, the OY for sablefish was a range of 9,200-10,800 mt, lower thanthe 12,000 mt OY in 1987. The Council recommended that the fishery be managedfor 10,000 mt, allocating 52 percent (5,200 mt) to trawl gear and 48 percent(4,800 mt) to nontrawl gear, as agreed to by industry representatives in1987. A trip limit was imposed on the trawl fishery of 6,000 pounds or20 percent of all fish on board, whichever was greater, and only two landingsa week above 1,000 pounds were allowed (53 FR 248, January 6, 1988). An800 mt reserve, to be used in conjunction with even more restrictive triplimits, was available to the trawl fleet if needed to avoid discardingincidental catches in excess of the trawl allocation. On August 3, 1988(53 FR 29480), the trawl trip limit was lowered to 2,000 pounds once aweek and the trawl allocation was increased by 800 mt for a total maximumtrawl allocation of 6,000 mt. The trip frequency limit subsequently wasremoved, resulting in a limit of 2,000 pounds per trip, on October 5, 1988(53 FR 39606, October 11, 1988) because the once per week landing restrictionwas increasing discards while not decreasing the catch of sablefish. Projectedlandings for the trawl fleet in 1988 are about 5,200 mt, the allocationlevel initially desired by the Council.In 1988, the nontrawl fishery reached its allocation and was closed onAugust 26, 1988 (53 FR 32621). Data available in November indicate thatlandings were about 5,000 mt, about 200 mt higher than the nontrawl allocation.Therefore, total trawl and nontrawl landings of sablefish in 1988 are projectedto be about 10,200 mt, well within the OY range of 9,200-10,800 mt.A new stock assessment for 1989 reveals that the sablefish biomass is higherthan that needed to produce MSY. Therefore catches 2,000 mt above the 9,000mt ABC in 1989, as suggested by the OY range of 10,400 mt-11,000 mt, willnot jeopardize the resource but will hasten the rate of achieving the 8,200mt MSY. If catches are between 10,400 and 11,000 mt in 1989, the GMT projectsthat the population level that can produce MSY will be reached in about5-7 years. However, if catches were to exceed 15,400 mt in 1989, the sablefishstock would be driven, in one year, below the biomass that produces MSY.This high rate of landings is not recommended because: (1) It would bevery disruptive to the industry to reduce landings from over 15,000 mtto 8,200 mt in one year; and, (2) the estimated MSY is based on a new stockassessment which should be tested by several years' data. If unrestricted,landings in 1989 could equal or exceed the highest on record, 24,500 mt.The GMT believes that catches of this magnitude would greatly increasethe likelihood of biological stress on the stock.In 1989, the Council intends to manage the sablefish fishery for 10,400mt, the low end of the OY range. On the basis of a request by the MakahIndian tribe to provide for a small tribal sablefish fishery and for thelandings of sablefish taken incidentally in the halibut fishery, the Councilrecommended subtracting 22 mt for the expected harvest by the Makah Indiantribe of northern Washington. Landings of sablefish by the Makah Indiantribe of northern Washington State are not subject to the trip, size, orallocation restrictions announced in this notice. However, if the 11,000mt OY for sablefish is reached, further landings of sablefish by the Makahtribe will be prohibited.The remaining 10,378 mt is to be allocated 52 percent (5,397 mt) for trawlgear and 48 percent (4,981 mt) for nontrawl gear. The trawl and nontrawlallocations are based on proportions negotiated by industry representativesfor 1987 and used in 1987 and 1988. The Council recommended continuationof these allocation percentages to equitably balance the needs of the twogear groups by providing the nontrawl fishermen an opportunity to plantheir harvest for their maximum benefit, and enabling trawl fishermen toconduct their mixed-species fishery with reduced discards of sablefish.The trip limit on trawl landings of sablefish, 1,000 pounds or 45 percentof the deepwater complex, is intended to manage the trawl fleet so thatits allocation will not be exceeded, discards will be minimized, and thefishery will last as long as possible during the year. The 1,000 poundlimit is intended to discourage target fishing, while the 45 percent limitwas selected to allow landings of most unavoidable catches of sablefishin the deepwater fishery consisting of sablefish, Dover sole, arrowtoothflounder, and thornyheads.Because the nontrawl fishery is primarily a target fishery for sablefish,incidental catches of that species are not a problem for most fixed gearfishermen. Also, most sablefish caught with nontrawl gear are frozen, andmaintenance of a year-long supply can be achieved even if the fishery isnot active. However, the commerical vertical hook and line and Californiaset net fisheries rely on small amounts of sablefish and operate laterin the year. If the nontrawl allocation is reached, these fisheries mustdiscard their catch of sablefish as was the case in 1988. In 1989, a 100pound trip limit will be imposed on the date necessary to avoid reachingthe nontrawl allocation in order to sustain these small fisheries as longas possible during the year.The GMT will monitor landings and recommend trip limit changes necessaryto meet the trawl and nontrawl allocations. Additional fishing restrictionsmay be imposed if needed to avoid exceeding these allocations, minimizediscards, and provide for equitable use of the resource.The 600 mt within the OY range (10,400-11,000 mt) are available to accommodateuncertainties in landings projections, enable some small fisheries thatoperate later in the year to land small amounts of sablefish after gearallocations have been reached, and allow for landings of sablefish caughtincidentally while fishing for other species. However, if total landingsreach 11,000 mt, the upper end of the OY range, all further landings ofsablefish will be prohibited.Trip limits on sablefish smaller than 22 inches (total length) have beenimposed since 1983 to reduce the likelihood of biological stress whichis expected if landings of juvenile sablefish are not curtailed. Marketsfor small sablefish have been strong and the overharvest of juvenile fishwhich become the future brood stock could occur if no size limit were imposed.These limits are designed to minimize discards and the likelihood of biologicalstress.The 5,000 pound trip limit for trawl-caught sablefish smaller than 22 inches,in effect since April 27, 1987 (52 FR 15726), is continued in 1989. Thislimit is included in the overall trawl trip limit so that, under the 1,000pound landing restriction, all sablefish may be smaller than 22 inches,and under the 45 percent deepwater complex limit, no more than 5,000 poundsof sablefish may be smaller than 22 inches.Similarly, the nontrawl trip limit of 1,500 pounds or three percent, whicheveris greater, for sablefish smaller than 22 inches, implemented August 3,1988 (53 FR 29480, August 5, 1988), will remain in effect in 1989. Whenthe 100 pound trip limit is imposed on nontrawl landings later in 1989,the size limit will no longer apply.<T3>Secretarial Action: </T3>The Secretary concurs with the Council's recommendationsand, pursuant to 663.22(a)(3), herein adjusts the management measures at663.27(b)(3) as follows:(1) 1989 Management Goal. The sablefish fishery will be managed to achieve10,400 mt, the low end of the OY range of 10,400-11,000 mt in 1989. If11,000 mt (the upper end of the OY range) is reached, further landingsof sablefish will be prohibited until January 1, 1990.(2) Makah Tribal Fishery. Twenty-two metric tons is set aside for the MakahIndian tribe. This amount is not a quota and landings by the Makah tribalfishery will not be prohibited unless 11,000 mt of sablefish have beenlanded.(3) Gear Allocations. After 22 mt for the Makah Indian tribe is subtractedfor 10,400 mt, the remaining 10,378 mt is allocated to two gear groups,52 percent (5,397 mt) to trawl and 48 percent (4,981 mt) to nontrawl landingsin 1989.(4) Trip and Size Limits.(a) <T3>Trawl gear. </T3>(i) For trawl-caught sablefish, no more than 1,000pounds or 45 percent of all legal fish on board in the deepwater complex(including sablefish), whichever is greater, may be taken and retained,possessed, or landed per vessel per fishing trip. These limits may be modifiedin season to achieve the trawl and nontrawl allocations.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note._</T4>Forty-five percent of the deepwater complex (including sablefish)is equivalent to 82 percent of all legal fish on board in the deepwatercomplex other than sablefish.</ITAG>(A) ``Deep water complex'' means sablefish (<T3>Anoplopoma fimbria</T3>), Dover sole (<T3>Microstomus pacificus</T3>), thornyheads (<T3>Sebastolobus </T3>spp.), and arrowtooth flounder (<T3>Atheresthes stomias</T3>).(B) Legal fish means groundfish taken and retained, possessed, or landedin accordance with the provisions of 50 CFR Part 663, the Magnuson Act,any notice issued under subpart B of Part 663, or any other regulationor permit promulgated under the Magnuson Act.(ii) Of those sablefish taken with trawl gear under paragraph (2)(a)(i)above, no more than 5,000 pounds of sablefish smaller than 22 inches (totallength) may be taken and retained, possessed, or landed per vessel perfishing trip.(b) <T3>Nontrawl gear. </T3>No more than 1,500 pounds or three percent, whicheveris greater, of sablefish smaller than 22 inches (total length) caught withnontrawl gear may be taken and retained, possessed, or landed per vesselper fishing trip.(c) Total length is measured from the tip of the snout (mouth closed) tothe tip of the tail (pinched together) without mutilation of the fish orthe use of additional force to extend the length of the fish.(d) For processed (``headed'') sablefish, (i) the minimum size limit is15.5 inches measured from the origin of the first dorsal fin (where thefront dorsal fin meets the dorsal surface of the body closest to the head)to the tip of the upper lobe of the tail; the dorsal fin and tail mustbe left intact; and,(ii) the product recovery ratio (PRR) established by the state where thefish is or will be landed is used to convert the processed weight to roundweight for purposes of applying the trip limit.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note._</T4>The Federal trip limit for processed (``headed'') sablefishis based on the product recovery ratios (PRRs) used by Washington, Oregon,or California, as in the past. It should be noted that the state PRRs maydiffer and fishermen should contact fishery enforcement officials in thestate where the fish will be landed to determine that state's officialPRR.</ITAG>(e) No sablefish may be retained which is in such condition that its lengthhas been extended or cannot be determined by the methods stated above.(5) The fishery management area for this species is the exclusive economiczone off the coasts of Washington, Oregon, and California between 3 and200 nautical miles offshore, and bounded on the north by the ProvisionalInternational Boundary between the United States and Canada, and boundedon the south by the International Boundary between the United States andMexico. However, all sablefish possessed 0-200 nautical miles offshore,or landed in, Washington, Oregon, or California are persumed to have beentaken and retained from 0-200 nautical miles offshore Washington, Oregon,or California unless otherwise demonstrated by the person in possessionof those fish.(6) Pursuant to andSection; 663.22(a)(3), the management measures at andSection;663.27(b)(3) are adjusted until further notice.(7) Nontrawl (fixed) gear includes set nets (gill and trammel nets), trapsor pots, longlines, commercial vertical hook-and-line gear, troll gear.(8) Trawl gear includes bottom trawls, roller or bobbin trawls, pelagictrawls, and shrimp trawls.(9) All weights and percentages of fish on board are based on round weights.If sablefish are processed, refer to paragraph (2)(d) for conversion toround weight.<ITAG tagnum="84">Inseason Adjustments</ITAG>At subsequent meetings, the Council will review the best data availableand recommend modifications to these management measures if appropriate.The Council intends to examine the progress of these fisheries during theyear in order to avoid overfishing and to extend the fisheries as longas possible throughout the year.<ITAG tagnum="84">Other Fisheries</ITAG>Retention of widow rockfish, Pacific ocean perch, the <T3>Sebastes</T3> complex, and sablefish by foreign fishing or foreignprocessing vessels is limited by incidental percentage limits establishedunder 50 CFR 611.70.U.S. vessels operating under an experimental fishing permit issued under50 CFR 663.10 also are subject to these restrictions unless otherwise providedin the permit.Landings of groundfish in the pink shrimp, spot and ridgeback prawn fisheriesare governed by regulations at 50 CFR 663.28. If fishing for groundfishand pink shrimp, spot or ridgeback prawns in the same fishing trip, thegroundfish restrictions in this notice apply.<ITAG tagnum="84">Classification</ITAG>The determination to impose these fishing restrictions is based on themost recent data available. The aggregate data upon which the determinationis based are available for public inspection at the Office of the Director,Northwest Region (see ADDRESSES) during business hours until the end ofthe comment period.An Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) was prepared for the FMP in 1982in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The alternativeand environmental impacts of the 1989 Notice of Fishing Restrictions arenot significantly different than those considered in the EIS for the FMP.Therefore this action is categorically excluded from the NEPA requirementsto prepare an Environmental Assessment in accordance with paragraph 5a(3)of the NOAA Directives Manual 02-10 because the alternatives and theirimpacts have not changed significantly. This action does not contain newcollection of information requirements subject to the Paperwork ReductionAct, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. and does not contain policies with federalismimplications sufficient to warrant preparation of a federalism assessmentunder Executive Order 12612. This action is covered by the Regulatory FlexibilityAnalysis (RFA) prepared for the authorizing regulations at 50 CFR 663.22and 663.23, and therefore fulfills the requirements of Executive Order12291. A copy of the RFA may be obtained at the addresses listed above.Section 663.23 of the groundfish regulations states that the Secretarywill publish a notice of action reducing fishing levels in proposed formunless he determines that prior notice and public review are impracticable,unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest. Section 663.23 also statesthat any notice issued under this section will not be effective until 30days after publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, unless the Secretary finds and publishes withthe notice good cause for an earlier effective date. Prompt action to limitthese fishing rates is necessary to protect the widow rockfish, <T3>Sebastes</T3> complex, Pacific ocean perch, and sablefish stocks andalleviate the necessity for fishery closures before the end of 1989. Ifunrestricted, landings unquestionably will result in several ABCs beingexceeded in 1989, increasing the likelihood of biological stress on thosestocks. Consequently, further delay of these actions is impracticable andcontrary to the public interest, and there is good cause to take theseactions in final form effective January 1, 1989.The public has had opportunity to comment on these management measures.The public participated in the Groundfish Select Group, GMT, GroundfishAdvisory Subpanel, and Council meetings in October and November 1988 thatgenerated the management actions endorsed by the Council and the Secretary.Further public comments will be accepted for 15 days after the date ofpublication of this notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.The restrictions in this notice will remain in effect until rescinded,modified, or suspended.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 50 CFR Parts 663 and 611</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Fisheries, Fishing, Foreign relations.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: December 30, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Joe P.
