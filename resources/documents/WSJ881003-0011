In 1980 and 1984 Republicans outflanked the post-Watergate spending limits on publicly financed presidential campaigns by outspending Democrats substantially at the state-party level with millions of dollars from private donors. In the 1980 contest, originally forecast as a tight race, GOP strategists figured their extra money might buy a one- or two-point edge.    The 1988 campaign also is predicted to be close. But this time Democrats seem to have evened the money score.    For example:   --In California, a state that Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis almost certainly must carry to win the presidency, Democrats recently doubled their budget and now plan to spend $4 million to $5 million for what is advertised as the biggest grass-roots operation in the state party's history. Democrats say they are hiring 500 field workers to recruit neighborhood captains for each of the state's 23,637 precincts. The comparable GOP California budget is just under $5 million.    --In Texas, another must-win state, the Democratic Party has increased its planned spending to nearly $5 million for the inglorious work of knocking on doors and telephoning voters. Republicans admit to budgeting only $3.5 million. &quot;I think you are going to have pretty competitive expenditures,&quot; says Ed Martin, executive director of the Texas Democratic Party.    --In Michigan, yet another battleground state, the Democratic Party is running a $1.5 million effort to find 500,000 ticket-splitting voters who will vote Democratic. Republicans are trying to raise a similar amount to locate 500,000 sympathetic swing voters of their own.    &quot;Things have gone well,&quot; says Robert Farmer, chief fund-raiser for Mr. Dukakis. &quot;We'll be on that level playing field with Republicans.&quot; Mr. Farmer says $2 million was raised last week at an event in Illinois, bringing the total in private donations thus far to nearly $40 million. Four more such major fund-raising events are planned.    The party's small-donor campaign also is flourishing: Mr. Farmer says direct mail already has netted $12 million, well ahead of the $10 million initially projected for the entire year. He now estimates the mail will bring in $15 million.    Even more money is expected from major donors writing checks for $100,000 each. Mr. Farmer expects a total of $20 million from such wealthy givers. Money is so plentiful, in fact, that the Dukakis camp can afford the luxury of refusing contributions from persons it considers a little shady. &quot;I won't mention who these people are, but we've returned several $100,000 checks,&quot; Mr. Farmer says.    Overall, Mr. Farmer says the party will meet his original goal of $50 million in private donations for next month's election. The money is going to finance various party activities -- such as the California and Texas voter drives -- that indirectly aid the Dukakis campaign, and other Democratic candidates as well.    Republicans, caught by surprise, initially had budgeted less. During August's GOP convention, some party officials talked about raising Mr. Farmer's ante by several tens of millions, but now they insist they will be content to stay even. Senior GOP fund-raiser Robert Mosbacher says he's trying to raise whatever Mr. Farmer does, &quot;plus $1.&quot;    The Republicans' &quot;Team 100,&quot; a late-starting effort to solicit $100,000 checks, has so far realized only about $5 million, a fraction of the originally announced goal of $30 million to $50 million. Still, Republicans figure they can put perhaps $25 million into state party activities through what they call &quot;Victory '88.&quot; GOP fund-raiser Fred Bush (no relation to GOP nominee George Bush) says about $17 million of that is already in hand, most of it in donations small enough to be legal for direct use in any federal campaign.    The feeling of financial parity is an unaccustomed one for the national Democratic Party, which only recently has emerged from a generation of chronic debt and hand-to-mouth financing dating back to Hubert Humphrey's 1968 presidential campaign.    As recently as 1984, the Democratic Party managed only $2.7 million in so-called coordinated spending to augment Walter Mondale's bid to unseat Ronald Reagan, for whom Republicans easily spent $6.8 million, close to the full amount then allowed by federal law.    This year both parties will easily reach the maximum amount allowed for coordinated expenditures, now $8.3 million after upward adjustment for inflation. This money, which parties may raise from private donors, goes mostly for television advertising. And by law, both the Bush and Dukakis campaigns are limited to spending only the $46.1 million they each received from the federal treasury.    Beyond those sums, the Democratic and Republican parties are permitted to spend unlimited amounts of private money for such things as state-level voter canvassing, volunteer-intensive activities, and even radio and television advertising that urges citizens to &quot;vote Democratic&quot; or &quot;vote Republican&quot; without naming candidates. In 1984, according to an estimate by Herbert Alexander in his book, &quot;Financing the 1984 Election,&quot; Republicans spent nearly $16 million this way while Democrats spent only $6 million. But this time the state-level spending seems more even.    Democrats are buying this rough equality largely with money from the rich. The Federal Election Commission allows parties wide use of what is called &quot;soft money.&quot; This is corporate or union money that would be illegal in a federal campaign but legal at the state level, or sizable donations from wealthy donors giving at the state level far more than the $25,000 a year they are allowed to give in federal political donations.    The other day, Republicans disclosed their largest known political gift since the 1972 Nixon campaign: $503,263 from a former ambassador to Hungary, Nicolas Salgo of New York. But that still didn't match the $1 million received last year by the Democratic Party from Californian Joan Kroc, widow of the founder of McDonald's Corp. Democrats also seem to hold a lead in the total amount of soft money; a party spokesman says $15 million has come in so far this year, while the GOP claims to have raised just under $10 million.    Big business also is giving more. The Republican National Committee just made public an unaudited list of what it said are all of this year's soft-money donors through Sept. 23, showing donations including $100,000 from R.J. Reynolds Industries, $110,000 from Occidental Petroleum Corp., $100,000 from Atlantic Richfield Co., which also gave $35,000 to the Democratic party, and $120,000 from the Trammell Crow Co. of Dallas. And although the Dukakis camp says it won't touch corporate funds, state parties aren't so fussy. California Democratic chairman Peter Kelly says his grass-roots campaign effort is being financed in large part by &quot;every big California corporation you can think of,&quot; including Bechtel Group Inc., Fluor Corp., Lockheed Corp., Southern California Gas Co., Arco and Chevron Corp.    Disclosure is spotty. Democrats previously made public a list of soft-money donations received during June and July, but won't list earlier gifts and are delaying disclosure of later donations until after the election. Still, it is clear that Democrats are raising plenty. Meanwhile some Republicans are criticizing the quest for $100,000 donors.    Says the GOP's Mr. Mosbacher, &quot;It's something that if the Democrats hadn't started we couldn't have and wouldn't have done. When you give money that big there is always the perception that there is something wrong with it. . . . I'm not sure long term it's such a good idea.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
