MCI Chairman William McGowan said Tuesday that MCI filed suitbecause ATandamp;T is using false and deceptive ads comparing the twolong-distance phone services in a ``desperate'' attempt to stem theloss of customers.   ``They are panicking about it,'' McGowan said.   ATandamp;T's market share has fallen to 75 percent since MCI broke theold Bell System's monopoly on U.S. phone service in the 1970s.MCI's share now is more than 10 percent.   McGowan said MCI research showed ATandamp;T is losing even more than100,000 customers a week, but MCI's marketing department, which hasbeen trumpeting that number in its own ads, ``likes round numbers.''   But, he said, MCI is suffering substantial financial losses evenas it takes away ATandamp;T customers.   The MCI lawsuit in U.S. District Court, the latest in a longstring of dustups between the nation's two leading long-distancecompanies, charges ATandamp;T made false comparisons between its serviceand MCI's Primetime, cut-rate long-distance calling plan.   MCI complains about ATandamp;T ads that say MCI's rates are cheaperonly when brief calls are made over 900 miles away and after 7 p.m.and that MCI customers ``might have had better luck calling Mars''than trying to reach MCI for an explanation of their bills.   ATandamp;T ``maliciously attacked MCI's honesty and the value of MCI'scompeting services by falsely and deceptively representing thatATandamp;T was superior to its competitors in general, and MCI inparticular, in terms of trustworthiness, quality and price,'' thesuit said.   MCI itself is known for aggressive advertising, such as showingpeople fainting when they see their non-MCI long-distance phonebills. But McGowan said MCI now is being outspent 8-to-1 by ATandamp;T inadvertising.   He said he could not estimate the losses MCI had suffered as aresult of ATandamp;T ads, but he said ``it's substantial.''   ATandamp;T spokesman Herb Linnen said, ``We welcome the opportunity todiscuss who is misleading whom and will do so in a countersuit. ...We have been concerned about MCI's sometimes misleading print andbroadcast advertising and have complained about it directly toMCI.''   He said ATandamp;T attorneys sent a letter to ABC, CBS, NBC and CNNthis month complaining that MCI was stretching facts in ads thatclaim ``MCI always saves you money over ATandamp;T, month after month''and that every week 100,000 ATandamp;T customers switch to MCI.   ATandamp;T said the ads are false and asked the networks to stoprunning them.   Linnen said ABC and CBS had replied that they would look intothe matter, but NBC and CNN had not yet responded to the letter.   ``ATandamp;T stands behind its advertising,'' Linnen added.   MCI complains in its suit about ATandamp;T statements that non-ATandamp;Tcompanies provide slow telephone connections, that other companiesdon't operate worldwide like ATandamp;T and that competing 800, facsimileand WATS services are inferior.   The suit asks the court to stop ATandamp;T ``from making false ordeceptive representations that any ATandamp;T service is materiallysuperior to any competing MCI service in terms of quality or lowercost, or that MCI has misrepresented its services or rates toconsumers.''   It also asks a judge to force ATandamp;T to stop advertising for 12months unless ``such information clearly and conspicuouslydiscloses a court-approved corrective notice that mitigates thelingering effects of the misrepresentations described therein.''   MCI also wants the profits ``wrongfully amassed by ATandamp;T on thesale of its products or services during the period in question,''plus interest and legal fees. The suit does not put a price onthose profits.</TEXT></DOC>
