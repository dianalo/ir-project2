The 43-year-old president spoke of his Marxist government'sefforts to achieve a negotiated settlement to the war and U.S. andPakistani policies.   President Bush and Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of Pakistanagreed during their meetings in Washington last week to search for apolitical settlement to the Afghan conflict.   The revolt began after leftist officers seized power in 1978 andtried to impose Marxism in this predominantly Moslem country. Atleast 1.3 million people have been killed in the war and about 5million Afhans _ a third of the population _ have sought refuges inneighboring Pakistan and Iran.   Bush and Ms. Bhutto also agreed, however, that the United Statesshould continue providing weapons to the rebels and seek an end toNajib's rule.   ``It is too early to determine whether they are serious andsincere,'' Najib said of the two leaders.   ``How can one talk about a political settlement and reject oneside in the conflict _ the government of Afghanistan?,'' he asked.``Rendering military assistance to the armed opposition meansnothing but continuing war. Rendering military assistance to thosewho openly refuse a political settlement actually means continuingwar and bloodshed and therefore preventing a political settlement.''   The guerrillas refuse to negotiate with Najib but their campaignto topple his government has stalled. There are doubts within theU.S. administration that the fractious rebel alliance based inPakistan will succeed.   Pakistani officials have said the guerrillas could negotiate withthe Kabul government if Najib and prominent members of the governingPeople's Democratic Party of Afghanistan were removed from power.They also expressed hope the United States can press Moscow to dropits insistence that the party be part of any future government.   Najib, a physician, was tapped by the Soviets in May 1986 toreplace Babrak Karmal and then was elected president in November1987 by the Grand National Assembly, the highest governing body inAfghanistan.   He has said he would step down if that would guarantee peace inhis war-devastated country.   After the last Soviet troops left Afghanistan on Feb. 15, many inthe West predicted the government would collapse within weeks ormonths. The guerrillas switched from hit-and-run tactics andlaunched a frontal assault on the eastern city of Jalalabad in earlyMarch and later offensives on the southern cities of Khost andKandahar.   But the Afghan armed forces held their ground, bolstering thegovernment's confidence.   ``How do we look weak or strong?'' Najib asked, speaking throughan interpreter. ``They haven't had a single military victory. Howshould we feel?''   With his troops able to stand alone, Najib has stepped up callsfor a cease-fire, peace talks and formation of a coalitiongovernment, to be followed by election of a new government.   He has appealed to some guerrilla field commanders and theirfighters to accept a truce. Major commanders rejected his offer butNajib said about 60,000 guerrillas agreed to stop fighting andnegotiations were continuing continued.   The Soviets intervened in Afghanistan in December 1979 and sentmore than 100,000 military personnel into the country to help thegovernment.   Najib directed many of his remarks toward Washington.   ``Children ... are being killed in cold blood. Is that what Mr.Bush would want for the American children? Everyday hundreds ofwomen are grieving over the loss of their loved ones. Is that whatMr. Bush would want for American women?'' he said.   ``Does the United States want fundamentalists, extremists andterrorists or a government based on democratic principles,nonaligned and neutral. Hasn't the United states tasted the bitterpill of extremism?'' he asked, possibly referring to Iran'sfundamentalist Islamic government. ``Does it want another one inAfghanistan?''   Najib said, ``Our position is crystal clear _ the only practicaland realistic solution for the cessation of war between all sides isto sit around a negotiating table and form a colaition government.''</TEXT></DOC>
