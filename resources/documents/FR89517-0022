A large number of commentswere received and a public hearing was held on April 14, 1983. This document proposes a more extensive set of amendments to the regulationsunder section 174 than those proposed in 1983. These regulations are proposedto clarify the definition of ``research and experimental expenditures''under section 174, and to provide guidance on the application of section174 to the costs of developing computer software. <ITAG tagnum="84">Explanation of Provisions </ITAG>Section 1.174-2 of the regulations as proposed in 1983 included extensiveclarifications of the regulations under section 174, including a clarificationof the treatment of computer software. Section 1.174-2(a)(3) of the 1983 proposed regulations provided that thecosts of developing computer software are not ``research or experimentalexpenditures'' within the meaning of section 174 unless the computer softwareis new or significantly improved. The l983 proposed regulations also providedthat such term does not include costs paid or incurred for the developmentof software the operational feasibility of which is not seriously in doubt.A large number of comments were received that were critical of the proposedcomputer software provisions on the basis that the proposed regulationstreated computer software differently from other products. On January 26,1987, the Service announced in Notice 87-12 (1987-4 I.R.B. 14) that finalregulations under section 174 would clarify that software development costsqualify as research expenses under the same standards as apply to the costsof developing other products or processes. The regulations proposed bythis document revise and supersede the 1983 proposed amendments to theregulations.These regulations contain a number of examples clarifying the applicationof section 174 to software development costs. The Service currently isstudying the continuing validity of Rev. Proc. 69-21 (1969-2 C.B. 303)in light of the enactment of section 263A of the Code. Taxpayers are invitedto comment on the proper treatment of computer software that does not qualifyfor section 174 treatment. Any change in the tax treatment of computersoftware will be prospective. Section 1.174-2(a)(1)(iv) of the 1983 proposed regulations provided inpart that the term ``research or experimental expenditures'' does not includethe routine or periodic alteration or improvement of existing products,commercial existing products, commercial production lines, or other ongoingoperations. A number of commentators suggested that the proposed regulationscould be read to require a significant improvement for an activity to qualifyunder section 174. They suggested that such a reading would be overly restrictivebecause research and development activities may in many instances be partof an evolutionary process involving a series of minor improvements that,when taken together over a period of time, lead to a significantly improvedproduct. The regulations proposed by this document do not include the referenceto ``routine'' or ``periodic'' improvements. However, expenditures incurredafter the point that a product or property (or component of the productor property) meets its basic design specifications related to functionand performance level generally will qualify as research or experimentalexpenditures only if the expenditures relate to modifications to the basicdesign specifications for the purpose of curing significant defects indesign, obtaining significant cost reductions or achieving significantlyenhanced function or performance level. The regulations proposed by thisdocument also modify the proposed regulations in certain other aspects.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Impact Analysis </ITAG>These proposed rules are not major rules as defined in Executive Order12291. Therefore, a Regulatory Impact Analysis is not required. <ITAG tagnum="84">Comments and Requests for a Public Hearing </ITAG>Before adopting these proposed regulations, consideration will be givento any written comments that are submitted to the Internal Revenue Service.All comments will be available for public inspection and copying. A publichearing will be held upon written request to the Internal Revenue Serviceby any person who also submits written comments. If a public hearing isheld, notice of the time and place will be published in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4><ITAG tagnum="84">Drafting Information </ITAG>The principal author of these proposed regulations is David R. Haglundof the Office of Assistant Chief Counsel (Passthroughs and Special Industries).However, personnel from other offices of the Internal Revenue Service andthe Treasury Department participated in their development. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 26 CFR 1.61-1 through 1.281-4 </ITAG>Income taxes, Taxable income, Deductions, Exemptions. <ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Amendments to the Regulations </ITAG>The proposed amendments to 26 CFR Chapter I, Part 1 are as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 1_[AMENDED] </ITAG><T4>Paragraph 1. </T4>The authority for Part 1 continues to read in part:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>26 U.S.C. 7805. * * *</ITAG><T4>Par. 2. </T4>Section 1.174-2 is amended as follows:1.

Paragraph (a)(3) is redesignated as paragraph (a)(8) and is amendedby removing ``subparagraph (2)'' and adding in its place ``paragraph (a)(7)''.4. New paragraphs (a) (2), (3), (4), (5) and (6) are added to read as setforth below. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1.174-2</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Definition of research and experimental expenditures. </ITAG>(a) <T3>In general. </T3>(1) The term ``research or experimental expenditures,''as used in section 174, means expenditures incurred in connection withthe taxpayer's trade or business which represent research and developmentcosts in the experimental or laboratory sense. The term includes generallyall such experimental or laboratory costs incident to the development orimprovement of an experimental or pilot model, a plant process, a product,a formula, an invention, or a similar property. It includes research orexperimentation aimed at the discovery of new knowledge and research orexperimentation searching for new applications of either research or experimentationfindings or other knowledge. However, not all of the expenditures incidentto developing or improving a product or property will qualify as researchor experimental expenditures within the meaning of section 174. Expendituresincurred after the point that the product or property (or component ofthe product or property) meets its basic design specifications relatedto function and performance level generally will not qualify as researchor experimental expenditures under section 174 unless the expendituresrelate to modifications to the basic design specifications for the purposeof curing significant defects in design, obtaining significant cost reductionsor achieving significantly enhanced function or performance level. (2) The following examples illustrate the application of the principlescontained in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (1). </T3>Company B, a manufacturing company, decided to developand market a new type of kitchen appliance. Company B incurred $500x ofexpenses relating to developing the basic performance and functional designspecifications and constructing a prototype of the appliance based on thesespecifications. After B developed the product to the point where it metits basic design specifications, B incurred $250x of additional expenditures,including expenditures for minor modifications of the product to facilitatethe manufacturing process, writing and printing an owner's manual, designingthe case to contain the appliance, and performing quality control testingand market research. The $500x of expenses incurred to develop the applianceto meet its basic design specifications qualifies as research and experimentalexpenditures within the meaning of section 174. The $250x expended by Bafter the proposed product achieved its basic design specifications doesnot qualify as research or experimental expenditures within the meaningof section 174. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (2).</T3> Assume the same facts as in example (1) except thatafter the appliance has been fully developed and marketed, B discoversthat the vibration level of the appliance could be reduced substantiallyand its useful life substantially extended by altering the basic designspecifications. The costs incurred by B to alter the basic design specificationsto reduce the vibration level and extend the useful life of the applianceare research or experimental expenditures within the meaning of section174 because they relate to a modification of the basic design specificationsof a component of a product.</ITAG>(3) The term ``research or experimental expenditure'' does not includeany cost incurred in connection with the following activities unless theexpenditures relating to such activities separately qualify under section174_ (i) Efficiency surveys or management studies; (ii) Consumer surveys, market development, or market testing (includingmarket research, advertising, or promotions); (iii) The routine or ordinary testing or inspection of materials or productsfor quality control; (iv) Activities relating to management functions or techniques developedprimarily for internal use of the taxpayer in its trade or business andnot generally intended for sale to customers; (v) Activities not directed at the functional aspects of a product includingexpenses relating to style, taste, cosmetic, or seasonal design factors;(vi) Activities relating to the implementation of commercial production;(vii) The construction of duplicate prototypes used for market testingpurposes or held for sale; (viii) The adaptation of an existing capability to a particular requirementor customer's need; (ix) Routine data collections; (x) The acquisition of another person's patent, model, or production process;or (xi) Literary, historical, or similar projects. However, the term includesthe costs of obtaining a patent, such as attorneys' fees expended in makingand perfecting a patent application. See section 263A and the regulationsthereunder for cost capitalization rules that apply to expenditures paidor incurred for research in connection with literary, historical or similarprojects involving the production of property, including the productionof films, sound recordings, video tapes, books, or similar properties.(4) The following examples illustrate the application of the principlescontained in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (1). </T3>M Corporation, a textile manufacturer, develops anew synthetic fiber for use in a variety of applications. After extensivetesting, the corporation decides that fabric made of the new fiber meetsits basic design specifications and is ready for production. After initialmarketing of the fabric, the corporation discovers that flaws exist ina significant percentage of the marketed fabric. The corporation determinesthat the flaws can be eliminated by adjusting the weaving machines so asto slightly loosen the weave of the fabric. Section 1.174-2(a) (3)(vi)provides that the term ``research and experimental expenditures'' doesnot include activities relating to the implementation of commercial productionunless such expenditures separately qualify under section 174. Since theexpenses of modifying the production line were incurred implementing commercialproduction specifications and did not relate to modifications of the basicdesign specifications of the fabric, such expenses do not constitute section174 expenses. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (2). </T3>O Corporation, a manufacturer of perfume, decidesto create a new perfume to sell to teenage girls. In laboratory tests,O Corporation developed a variety of scents, evaluating the odor of eachscent, as well as its physical properties, such as whether it causes anallergic reaction. After this laboratory testing yielded several satisfactoryalternatives which met O Corporation's basic design specifications, thecorporation conducted consumer surveys to determine the preferences ofpotential customers. Based on information from this consumer survey, OCorporation selected one scent to market as a new perfume. Under andSection;1.174-2(a)(1), the term ``research and experimental expenditures'' means``research and development costs in the experimental and laboratory sense.''Paragraph (a)(3)(v) of this section further provides that the term doesnot include ``activities not directed at the functional aspects of a productincluding expenses relating to style, taste, cosmetic, or seasonal designfactors.'' Although the expenditure relates to a consumer taste, the costsof developing the basic scent of the perfume will separately qualify undersection 174 if they are research and experimental expenditures within themeaning of section 174. The costs of developing alternative perfumes tomarket to teenagers, however, do not constitute research or experimentalexpenditures under section 174 because the alternatives do not alter thebasic design specifications of the perfume. However, the costs relatingto the functional aspects of perfume, such as whether it causes an allergicreaction on certain persons, may qualify as section 174 expenses. Finally,the costs of conducting surveys to determine customer preferences withrespect to the alternative perfumes do not constitute section 174 expensesbecause of the exclusion for consumer surveys or market testing activities.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (3). </T3>The facts are the same as in example (2), exceptthat after the perfume was in production, O Corporation continued to testeach batch of perfume to determine whether that batch is allergenic. Thecost of performing such tests relate to quality control and do not constituteresearch or experimental expenditures under section 174.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (4). </T3>P Corporation, manufacturer of automobiles, decidesto redesign the body of one of its existing models. This process typicallyinvolves a series of steps. Initially, the corporation's designers, workingwith certain basic design specifications, develop several alternative styles.From these alternative designs, the corporation's management will selectone design which will then be tested by the corporation's engineers fora variety of functional specifications, including its aerodynamic efficiencyand safety. Section 1.174-2(a)(3)(v) provides that section 174 does notinclude activities relating to the nonfunctional aspects of a product.Therefore, the costs of developing alternative designs for P corporation'snew model do not constitute research or experimental expenditures undersection 174. However, the costs relating to the aerodynamic testing andsafety may constitute research or experimental expenditures under section174. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (5). </T3>In 1987, S, a company that publishes general referencebooks for use by the general public, decides to publish textbooks for usein high schools throughout the country. To develop each textbook, S incursexpenses to develop the theme and topic of the textbook, obtain manuscriptsfrom authors, edit the author's submission and obtain illustrations forthe textbook. None of these expenses qualifies as research or experimentalexpenditures under section 174 by virtue of the exclusion for ``literary,historical, or similar projects.'' and because they do not separately qualifyas research and experimental expenditures within the meaning of section174. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (6). </T3>G is a designer and manufacturer of specialized computerchips that will perform certain functions on a customer-designed hardwaresystem in accordance with a customer's specifications. Each chip is custom-designed,through a process of experimentation, for a customer's specific order atG's risk. Each chip has a different basic design specification. The costsof designing and developing each chip are research and experimental expenditureswithin the meaning of section 174, even though the chips are intended fora specific customer because each chip has different basic design specifications.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (7). </T3>R, which is in the business of making cranes to beused for building construction, uses the same type of parts for each craneit manufactures. R designs and manufactures each crane in different configurationsdepending on the type of buiIding being constructed, the situation of thebuiIding on the building site, and the distances between the site and thenearest streets. However, the cranes do not have different basic designspecifications. The costs of designing and manufacturing the cranes arenot research or experimental expenditures within the meaning of section174 because they are costs of adapting an existing capability to a particularrequirement or customer's need. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (8). </T3>B, a small manufacturer, develops a new employeetraining program for its business to conform to recent changes in managementscience. The costs of developing the employee training program do not qualifyas research or experimentation because of the exclusion for managementfunctions or techniques. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (9). </T3>C, a biotechnology firm, developed a new drug thatsubstantially lowers blood pressure. Prior to marketing the drug, C incurscosts to test the product and obtain FDA approval of the drug. The costsincurred by C to develop, test, and receive government approval of thedrug are research and experimental expenditures within the meaning of section174. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (10). </T3>D, a manufacturer of tires, develops a new tirethat is more puncture-resistant than any tire it has previously developedand marketed. Prior to production of the new tire, D constructs a numberof duplicate prototypes for use in several different safety tests. Afterthe safety tests are completed, D constructs additional duplicate prototypesto offer to car dealers for testing by their customers. D subsequentIysold some of the tires that were used for safety or market testing. Thecosts of manufacturing the duplicate prototypes that were used for safetytesting and were not held for sale to customers qualify for section 174treatment. The costs relating to constructing the duplicate prototypesfor market testing or sale to customers, however, do not qualify undersection 174 because of the exclusion for duplicate prototypes. In addition,none of the costs of market testing qualifies under section 174 becauseof exclusion for market testing activities. </ITAG>(5) The costs of developing computer software qualify as research or experimentalexpenditures within the meaning of section 174 under the same rules thatapply to other products or properties.(6) The following examples illustrate the application of the principlescontained in paragraph (a)(5) of this section.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (1). </T3>F, a company in the business of developing softwarefor sale to the public, intends to develop a new type of database managementsystem for microcomputers. The new program will be different from any otherproduct existing in the market and will contain new features and capabilitiesthat previousIy were only available on programs designed for mainframecomputers. Due to the differences between types of computers, F cannotuse its existing technology for mainframe computers to produce databasesystems for microcomputers. To begin development of the program, F developsa detailed program design of the new program describing its functions andperformance levels. Upon completion of the program design, F begins codingand testing the program as it is developed. After F had expended $500x,the program meets the basic design specifications. F then incurs $250xto prepare the program for market, including debugging, performing minormodifications to facilitate the manufacturing of the program, producingmultiple copies of the software to send to outside consulting firms forfurther testing, and writing the documentation for users. The $500x expendedto develop the program to meet its basic design specifications qualifiesas a research or experimental expenditure within the meaning of section174. The $250x expended after the program meets its basic design specificationsdoes not qualify as a research or experimental expenditure. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (2). </T3>Assume the same facts as in example (1), except thattwo years after marketing the database management system, a number of B'scustomers reported errors that caused the system to shut down after extensiveuse. B recalled each system from its customers and replaced it with a systemthat the customers could use on a temporary basis. During this period,B's engineers conducted research to discover the source of the error. Aftermonths of research, B's engineers discovered a defect in the design ofthe system and redesigned the system to eliminate the problem. The expensesincurred to discover and correct the error are research and experimentalexpenditures within the meaning of section 174 because they relate to modificationsto the basic design specifications for the purposes of curing significantdefects in the original design of the product. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (3). </T3>D, a company in the business of developing softwarefor sale to the public, currently markets a program that is used to analyzeinformation derived from orbiting satellites. The existing software hasbeen designed to operate on a specific computer system and with a specificoperating system. Recent advances in satellite technology have changedthe amount, type, and format of the data that is transmitted by satellites.These advances in satellite technology require a change in the design ofthe program to achieve an increase in processing rate, improvements indata handling capabilities, and a change in functional specifications toanalyze the new data transmitted by satellites. Since the changes to bemade to the existing software involve modifications to the performancelevels and functions of the software, the costs incurred in connectionwith the development of the modifications to the basic design specificationsof the software qualify as research or experimental expenditures withinthe meaning of section 174. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (4). </T3>E, a company in the business of developing softwarefor sale to the public, currently markets a word processing program. Theprogram entitled ``Writer 1.0'' has been marketed to the public for oneyear. Based on comments received from customers of the program, E decidedto make changes to the program. Generally, these improvements involve addingsome additional commands to the program. On completion of the changes,all new copies of the program delivered to customers contain the changesand are entitled ``Writer 1.1.'' Previous customers of ``Writer 1.0'' areoffered the opportunity to obtain copies of ``Writer 1.1'' for a nominalcharge. Since the changes made to the existing software did not modifythe basic design specifications relating to performance levels and functionsof the software, the costs incurred in connection with the modificationsto the program do not qualify as research or experimental expenditureswithin the meaning of section 174.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (5). </T3>C, a developer of software, develops and sells aninventory control software system. B, a customer of  C, offers to buy C'ssoftware system but requires modification of the system to meet B's warehouseand distribution needs. Subsequently. C modifies: the inventory softwareto expand the number of data fields and to design a custom data input screen.These changes to the software do not alter the basic design specificationsof the software. C's expenditures to modify the software system do notqualify as research or experimental expenditures within the meaning ofsection 174 because they relate to the adaptation of an existing productto a particular customer's need. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (6). </T3>G, a manufacturing company, develops software thatautomatically prepares financial data and analysis for inclusion in theannual report to shareholders. The costs of developing the software systemare not research and experimental expenditures because the software relatesto internal management functions or techniques, and because they do notseparately qualify as research and experimental expenditures within themeaning of section 174. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (7). </T3>K, a manufacturer of machine equipment, intends toautomate its manufacturing process more fully. To this end, it begins developmentof an automated sorting system that will sort and test to determine whethercomponents to be used in assembly of its products meet specifications.As part of the development of the new system, software is developed thatwill operate the sorting system. The software is developed by employeesof K, written using standard computer programming language, and is notavailable for sale in the market. Although the software relates to theimplementation of commercial production, the development of the softwareseparately qualifies under section 174 because it relates to the developmentof a new plant process. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (8). </T3>C, publishing company, publishes a number of referencebooks including an encyclopedia. Due to the growing number of home computers,C decided that additional sales could be generated for the encyclopediaif it were published in electronic format. Therefore, C had the text ofthe encyclopedia coded onto data disks that can be read by personal homecomputers. The editorial content of the encyclopedia on the data disksis the same as the published edition. The costs of transferring the editorialcontent of the encyclopedia to the electronic media do not qualify as researchor experimental expenditures within the meaning of section 174 becausethey were incurred in connection with development of a literary product,and because they do not separately qualify as research and experimentalexpenditures within the meaning of section 174. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Lawrence B.
