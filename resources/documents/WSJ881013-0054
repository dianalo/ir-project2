The real estate service company is a master limited partnership that operates under the name Merrill Lynch Realty. It is 75% owned by Merrill Lynch andamp; Co.    For the third quarter, earnings rose to $17 million, or 57 cents a unit, from $7.6 million, or 25 cents a unit, a year earlier. Revenue rose 19% to $219.7 million from $184 million.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Fine Homes closed at $14.875 a share, up 12.5 cents.    Nine-month net was $41.3 million, or $1.39 a unit, and revenue was $600.4 million. The company said those figures can't be compared with the 1987 nine months, because the company was wholly owned by Merrill Lynch until June 1987. </TEXT></DOC>
