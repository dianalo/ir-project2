Doe. One of the defendants is a former U.S.Army sergeant.   An indictment was returned Monday against the ex-serviceman,James Henry Bush, 40, of Baltimore, and Curtis Elmer Williams, 45,of Jersey City, N.J..   Also charged in the indictment was Mike Jackson, a Liberian wholived in exile in neighboring Ivory Coast until his arrest in July.   The three are charged with illegally entering Liberia in Julywith the intent of staging a coup and killing Doe.   Williams' wife, Gwendolyn, said her husband was in the businessof importing cement to Liberia and planned no wrongdoing when hetraveled to the country.   ``I feel that he's innocent because when he left here, he lefton business,'' Mrs. Williams, 30, told The Associated Press in atelephone interview from her home in Jersey City. ``They happenedto be in the wrong place at the wrong time.''   Williams' name was given as William Elmer Curtis, but Mrs.Williams said that was an error.   Five members of the purported coup plot were killed in a July 13clash with Liberian security men, including Liberian Maj. Gen. J.Nicholas Podier, Doe's former deputy and the plot's reportedmastermind, the indictment says.   The document identifies the others killed as ex-soldier HumphreyMoore and John Seekie, both Liberians. The indictment gave nodetails on Seekie and said the other two dead men have not beenidentified.   The government said the coup plotters entered Liberia from theIvory Coast on July 10 near the village of Gbolay.   They reportedly hid for three days in a forest, but werediscovered by security forces on July 13 and a firefight ensued.   ``The three defendants were overpowered while Podier, Moore andJohn Seekie and two others presently unknown were killed as aresult of the gunfire,'' the indictment said.   Liberia was established in 1847 by former American slaves.   Doe, then an army master sergeant, took power in an April 12,1980 coup, overthrowing the government of William Tolbert andkilling the civilian leader.</TEXT></DOC>
