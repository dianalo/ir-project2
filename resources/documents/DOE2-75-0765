Itis particularly useful if a carrier with microbes growing on it is causedto rotate continuously or intermittently around an axis which is largelyhorizontal but inclined at about 3/sup 0/, leaving a free space in atube reactor filled 10-35%, where a speed or rotation of 1-10 rpm isbest. The emission of gas can be via a set of gas outlet openings atthe raised end of the rotating tube. An outer double jacket, over whichliquid is running, can be provided for a 'floating support'. An alternativeto this is a vertical reactor with carriers on vibrating plates, whichare caused to vibrate intermitently. A nitrate/nitrite reduction stagefor denitrification can precede this.</TEXT></DOC>
