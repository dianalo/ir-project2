The samplingof nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide is performed by PALMES diffusiontubes. The adsorbed gases are analysed ionchromatographically. For particledeposition measurement transparent collection plated are used. The dustsamples are investigated by optical microscopy. Image analysis yieldsparticle size distributions for inorganic and biogenic constituents andcombustion products down to a lower detection limit of 3 microns. A preliminaryevaluation was based on a two month data set collected in Freiburg betweenNovember 13, 1987 and January 15, 1988. The spatial mean of outdoor NO/sub2/-concentration has a value of 50.2 {mu}g/m/sup 3/, the mean indoorvalue from 15 homes showed a concentration of 42.4 {mu}g/m/sup 3/. Outdoorparticle deposition below 10 micron particle diameter varies significantlywith atmospheric diffusion conditions. The spatial distribution of airpollutants reflects not only the emission situation but also microclimatologicalconditions.</TEXT></DOC>
