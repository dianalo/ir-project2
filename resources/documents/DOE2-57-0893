The rope is then transported through an underground channel toa buffer store and finally to a deposit deep under the earth's surface,where it is wound on to a drum for long-term storage. The rope is equippedwith a monitoring system, based on optical fibers and with a guide, bywhich it can be brought up again from the long-term store.</TEXT></DOC>
