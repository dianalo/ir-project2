The largest insider sale was by Harley-Davidson Chairman Vaughn L. Beals Jr., who recently unloaded 100,000 shares, or 22% of his holdings in the company, for $2.9 million.    Richard F. Teerlink, president of the company, who sold 15,000 shares, said the insiders took profits as Harley-Davidson's stock climbed this spring and summer. These insiders have had virtually all their assets tied up in the company since 1981, he said, when Harley-Davidson was purchased in a leveraged buy-out. The Milwaukee-based company went public again in 1986.    &quot;Now, some of us want some of the advantages we've worked for,&quot; he said. &quot;My wife wants a new house.&quot; Mr. Teerlink sold his shares for $30.25 each, or $453,750, on May 19, according to insider filings. He retains 40,100 shares, held directly and indirectly.    Mr. Beals sold his shares in two blocks of 50,000 on July 7 and Aug. 8, for $27.13 and $29.88 a share, respectively, according to SEC filings. But big sales are a pattern for Mr. Beals, who unloaded even more shares as part of company stock offerings in both 1988 and 1987. He could not be reached for comment.    According to James Brostowitz, Harley-Davidson secretary-treasurer, when the company's stock began climbing towards $30 a share in the second quarter, the insiders took the opportunity to take profits. Other than the chairman and president, five other insiders have sold blocks of stock ranging from 500 to 65,000 shares since March 15.    Harley-Davidson stock closed yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading at $29.125, unchanged. ---    HOME-TOWN BOYS: BankWorcester Corp. of Worcester, Mass., is a small regional thrift with a big distinction: Eighteen of the total 26 insiders at the company have purchased BankWorcester stock in the past year.    Although their purchases have mostly been small-scale, that number of buyers ranks BankWorcester as the seventh most-purchased stock by insiders in the last year, according to SEC filings, right after such huge, household-name companies as Delta Air Lines and Deere andamp; Co.    James Stowe, a BankWorcester director who was one of seven insiders who bought in July, said unfavorable headlines about the troubled thrift industry &quot;have pushed the value of the stock down considerably,&quot; making it a bargain. In national over-the-counter trading, it closed yesterday unchanged at $16 a share, below the thrift's book value -- essentially, assets minus liabilities -- of $21.68 a share.    Mr. Stowe said he believes BankWorcester is more insulated from thrift problems than the industry as a whole, because of its location in the growing Worcester area and a conservative loan policy. Mr. Stowe bought 4,900 shares on July 27 for $72,912, bringing his stake to 11,975 shares. Other insiders who bought in July purchased 100 to 2,000 shares, all adding to existing holdings.    James Moynihan, an analyst who follows the Northeast banking stocks for Advest Group Inc., calls BankWorcester &quot;a good company, fairly well-run.&quot; According to Mr. Moynihan, it sells at a favorable price-earnings ratio, pays a $1 dividend and &quot;is attractive on its own pure fundamentals.&quot;    Said Mr. Stowe: &quot;When you're busy running a business, picking a stock can be risky. But if you're near something and can see what's going on, it's the kind of {investment} you can go to sleep with.&quot;    ---   QUICK CHANGE: Three Jiffy Lube International Inc. insiders sold most of their company stock shortly after the announcement that Pennzoil Co. would acquire an 80% stake in this Baltimore-based operator of quick auto-lubrication centers.    Moreover, the insiders sold out near the stock's low for the year, at $2.75 to $3, compared with a high this year of $8.50. The insiders sold 86% to 98% of their stakes in the firm. Their sales were not part of the Pennzoil purchase.    The most active insider seller was Jiffy Lube's chief financial officer and executive vice president, Edward F. Kelly III, who has sold 170,138 shares in the company since July 27, the day after the Pennzoil purchase was announced. His total take: $494,697.    Mr. Kelly said the sales &quot;were not related to my belief in the future&quot; of Jiffy Lube. He said he has been &quot;in need of raising capital&quot; for quite some time and &quot;was forced {under SEC insider trading rules} to hold tight until everything had been announced.&quot;    Unfortunately, said Mr. Kelly, he was forced to sell more shares of Jiffy Lube than he had originally planned to raise the needed capital because the stock price was so depressed. SEC records indicate Mr. Kelly sold his entire stake in the firm, but a spokeswoman for the company said he still holds 3,358 shares and intends to make an amended filing with the SEC to that effect.    Nicholas A. Greville, executive vice president of retail operations, sold 86% of his stake in the firm in two sales on July 28 and 31. He retains 2,614 shares, after selling 16,000 shares for $46,080. He could not be reached for comment.    Arnold Janofsky, vice president and general counsel, sold 10,000 shares on July 28 for $27,500. He has 466 shares of the company remaining. Mr. Janofsky sold his shares, he said, &quot;to meet expenses of a personal nature.&quot;    Jiffy Lube stock fell 12.5 cents yesterday to close at $2.625 in national over-the-counter trading. </TEXT></DOC>
