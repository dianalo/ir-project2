The novel strategy was unveiled Tuesday in the 70-count indictment of Alfred Elliott, an attorney charged with making $687,187 between 1984 and 1986 through insider trading. Mr. Elliott has already paid penalties totaling $500,000 to settle civil charges with the Securities and Exchange Commission. But prosecutors want more.    Mr. Elliott's fines leave him &quot;in the black,&quot; said Lawrence E. Rosenthal, an assistant U.S. Attorney handling the case. His boss, U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas, said the seizing of property would discourage people from calculating that their profit from insider trading might exceed the resulting fine and a jail sentence. &quot;You might still have some incentive (to trade on inside information) despite the fines,&quot; said Mr. Rosenthal.    Confiscation of property is allowed under the Racketeer Influence and Corrupt Organization Act (RICO). One count of the indictment against Mr. Elliott charges racketeering by alleging &quot;a pattern of related acts,&quot; specifically wire fraud. This is the first time such a charge has been lodged in an insider-trading case.    Critics said Chicago prosecutors are misusing the RICO law. &quot;This is government overreaching. I think the racketeering law should be reserved for cases against truly evil people,&quot; said Stanley Arkin, a New York defense attorney specializing in white-collar cases. &quot;Insider trading is bad, but not the worst sin in the world. When you think of racketeering, you think of murder-for-hire and heroin.&quot;    Prosecutors in drug cases have used the RICO law to confiscate dealers' boats, cars and even homes. Federal officials declined to elaborate on their plans to claim Mr. Elliott's property, and they wouldn't specify what he owns. But the officials said that the grand jury that brought the charges against him investigated his assets.    The 44-year-old Mr. Elliott, who now lives in Melbourne Beach, Fla., couldn't be reached for comment. In 1986, after the New York Stock Exchange informed the SEC of suspicious trading by Mr. Elliott, he agreed to pay the $500,000 without admitting or denying guilt. But prosecutors said he should be liable for the $187,187 difference between the penalty and his alleged profit.    It isn't clear why Mr. Elliott's penalties under the SEC's civil charges weren't larger. Civil insider-trading laws allow triple damages, prosecutors said.    Mr. Elliott, an attorney who specialized in takeovers at the Chicago law firm of Schiff Hardin andamp; Waite, was suspended from his job in March 1986. That was when the law firm learned that the SEC was investigating whether Mr. Elliott, who was a legal adviser to KN Energy Inc., was trading on inside information involving a takeover bid for his client by T. Boone Pickens Jr.'s Mesa Limited Partnership.    The indictment charges Mr. Elliott profited from his knowledge of nine pending transactions involving Schiff clients. He's also charged with failing to fully disclose his income on tax returns.    The securities and tax charges allow prison terms of no more than five years on each count, and judges usually specify that the sentences be served concurrently, thus reducing jail time in such cases. But the racketeering law carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. </TEXT></DOC>
