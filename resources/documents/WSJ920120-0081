Clinton Leads Poll   ----   By James M.

Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, who is leading the field inthe latest statewide poll, blasted Sens. Tom Harkin of Iowaand Bob Kerrey of Nebraska for voting themselves $23,000 payraises last year. &quot;These people in Washington,&quot; he said,&quot;just don't get it.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Sen. Harkin fired back that Gov. Clinton's proposal for atax cut for the middle class amounts to no more than about adollar a day, and that higher-income taxpayers would get alarger tax cut than people with lower incomes. He alsoattacked Mr. Clinton for increasing the sales tax inArkansas, &quot;sticking it to the little guy.&quot;   And former Sen. Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts jumped onSen. Kerrey for a television commercial in which he poses infront of a hockey-rink net and says Japan guards its goal,&quot;to keep our products out -- while we leave our net open.&quot;   &quot;You don't win a hockey game unless you score,&quot; said Sen.Tsongas.   The fifth candidate, former California Gov. Jerry Brown,who has been campaigning against corruption in the politicalsystem, switched themes entirely. He called for scrapping theentire tax code -- including the payroll tax, the corporatetax and federal excise taxes -- in favor of a flat tax of 13%to 14% on unadjusted gross income and value added bybusinesses. Only deductions for charitable donations, homemortgages and rent would be retained.   Sen. Harkin blasted the proposal. &quot;A flat tax,&quot; he said,&quot;sounds like something dreamed up by the Flat Earth Society.&quot;   The Democrats, who were pounded by the Republicans fouryears ago for softness on crime, struggled with each other todemonstrate their toughness against domestic violence and inthe war on drugs. Gov. Clinton even muscled his way into thediscussion to assert that he has twice sent convicts to theirdeaths.   &quot;We should not feel guilty,&quot; the governor said, &quot;aboutprotecting the innocent.&quot; Messrs. Kerrey and Tsongas stressedtheir support of the death penalty for drug kingpins, whileSen. Harkin suggested a mobilization of U.S. troops againstthe drug tide. &quot;We're in a drug war, and it's killing ourkids,&quot; said Mr. Harkin. &quot;We have to confront it like a warand put our resources up front on it.&quot;   Messrs. Harkin and Brown said they don't support capitalpunishment, with the former California governor attempting,as he repeatedly has in the past, to turn a specific issuequestion into an attack on &quot;the crime in the executivesuites&quot; and &quot;the crime in Congress.&quot;   The latest Boston Globe-WBJ-TV Poll, published yesterday,shows Gov. Clinton surging to the front of the field with 29%of the New Hampshire Democratic vote, followed by Sen.Tsongas with 17% and Sen. Kerry at 16%. The other twocandidates remain in single digits for the Feb. 18 primary.But according to the poll, the Democratic electorate remainsvolatile, and almost 80% haven't made up their minds on howto vote.   In their debate last night -- one of a series in NewHampshire and other states this year -- Mr. Kerrey's appealtook on a sense of urgency, with the candidate oftendirecting his parries at Mr. Clinton, sometimes even seekingto disparage his proposals as a &quot;laundry list.&quot; The Nebraskanemphasized time and again the details of his health-care planand his proposal to restructure the federal government.   Mr. Harkin, meanwhile, sought to portray himself as thetruest of the warriors for old Democratic values, repeatedlycriticizing President Bush and his &quot;trickle-down&quot; economicpolicies, and charging Gov. Clinton with having &quot;bought intoReaganomics&quot; in Arkansas.   The five Democrats agreed generally on the importance ofboosting educational standards and spending. &quot;Money matters,and money makes a difference,&quot; said Mr. Kerrey. But theydiffered slightly on the prescriptions for helping thenation's schools, with Mr. Tsongas showing a willingness toembrace an education-choice plan that would include privateschools and Mr. Brown emphasizing the importance ofhigh-technology tools such as computers.   Later, Mr. Clinton was forced to address allegations thathe was vulnerable to accusations that he is a womanizer --charges that he described as &quot;rumor-mongering, negative andtotally irrelevant stuff&quot; and dismissed as &quot;a pack of lies.&quot;The governor said the charges were fomented by Republicansand sought to assure Democrats that, as the governor of asmall state where secrets are hard to keep, that it's &quot;highlyunlikely that you have anything to worry about on thatscore.&quot;   ---   John Harwood in Washington contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
