The officer said other Burmese troops perched on two hills inBurma fired heavy shells on the Kaw Moo Ra stronghold, setting muchof it ablaze in the third straight day of heavy fighting.   About 1,200 guerrillas were defending the camp against 3,000soldiers, said the officer, speaking on condition of anonymity.   The camp is just across the Moei River separating Burma's KarenState and the Mae Sot district of Thailand's northern province ofTak.   The officer said 400 soldiers crossed into Mae Sot's BanWangkaew village, which has been evacuated due to the fighting, toset up artillery to shell the camp. Some also seized control of aroad about five miles from Mae Sot, the officer said.   Thai forces fired heavy rounds into the village, and the Burmesesoldiers later moved to another area inside Thailand, said theofficer.   He said Thai forces fired artillery rounds to warn another 100Burmese soldiers who crossed into another area of Mae Sot.   No soldiers were reported hurt in the clashes, but a 64-year-oldman was wounded by shrapnel from shells that strayed into Mae Sotfrom Burma.   ``They (the Burmese soldiers) are attacking across the river andfighting us from the Thai side,'' said a Karen official whodemanded anonymity.   He said the offensive against the rebels was the largest since1977 and that thousands of Karen civilians had fled to Thailand.   Thailand in the past has given sanctuary to the rebels, who havebeen fighting for four decades for greater autonomy.   But the trade-oriented Bangkok government has sent seniorofficials to Burma to discuss the situation and has repatriatedhundreds of Burmese students who had been fighting alongside therebels.   These actions broke the international isolation of the militarygovernment in Rangoon, which last year killed hundreds of peoplewhile putting down widespread, pro-democracy demonstrations led bystudents.   Government forces began shelling the Kaw Moo Ra strongholdThursday, two days after overrunning the major rebel base ofWangkha, two miles to the south.   Wangkha was the fifth Karen stronghold along the Thai frontierto be captured since the government launched an offensive inOctober.   A government spokesman said in Rangoon that at least 43 rebelsand 35 soldiers were killed in the battle for Wangkha.   With an estimated 4,000 combatants, the Karen National Union isthe largest of 10 ethnic insurgent groups joined in the NationalDemocratic Front.   The Karens began their revolt in 1949, the year after Burmaachieved independence from Britain. The rebels said at the timethat the government reneged on its promise of more autonomy forethnic minorities.</TEXT></DOC>
