Strong thunderstorms struck parts of Florida.   Northwestern Wyoming got 8 inches of wet snow, closing theeastern and southern entrances to Yellowstone National Park in themorning. South of the park, 5 inches of snow was reported in Mooseand Jackson, where wet snow accumulating on power lines caused someblackouts, the National Weather Service said.   Up to 14 inches of snow was reported in the mountains andfoothills of south-central Montana.   Snow also was widespread over eastern sections of Idaho andnorthern Utah. Parts of eastern Idaho got 5 inches of snowovernight. Up to 8 inches of snow was reported at Tooele, Utah,with 7 inches at the Snowbird ski resort and 5 inches at Alta.   In eastern Colorado, 50 mph winds spawned the dust storm, whichdropped visibility to zero and caused the pileups on Interstate 70near Seibert about 45 miles west of the Kansas border, said PeterHolmstedt of the Colorado State Patrol. Two motorists were killed,and 17 people injured, authorities said.   The incidents occurred in east- and westbound lanesof I-70between Limon and Seibert. Nearly 45 miles of the highway wasclosed for more than two hours before visibility improved.   High trucks and trailers were banned from Interstate 80 atWendover, Utah, because of strong, gusty wind. Bryce Canyon, Utah,reported gusts near 60 mph.   In New Mexico, winds gusted to 80 mph in Ruidoso and 60 mph inAlbuquerque. Ruidoso's Sierra Blanca Regional Airport was closed.   The northern and central high Plains also had gusty wind, withgusts to more than 50 mph throughout the Dakotas and gusts to 60mph in central Colorado at Gunnison and Trinidad.   A day before, the difference in pressure between that storm anda high-pressure front 700 miles off the West Coast generated 65 mphwind in Southern California, generating waves that destroyed amunicipal pier and stranded 1,400 tourists on Santa Catalina Island.   ``Whenever winds blow, it's due to a pressure difference, fromhigh to low, just like water running downhill,'' said Bob Grebe ofthe weather service.   On Sunday, the body of a man believed to be a boater who jumpedfrom a disabled craft in wind-tossed seas Saturday washed ashorenear the Los Angeles suburb of El Segundo, said Los Angeles CountyLifeguard Sgt. Tom Hargett.   Another man knocked off a boat five miles north of SantaCatalina Island on Saturday was missing Sunday, said Coast GuardPetty Officer Charles Embleton.   When the wind slammed 12-foot surf into the Redondo BeachMunicipal Pier on Saturday, a 155-foot section of the piercollapsed, said city spokesman Jim Graham. A restaurant also wasdamaged.   An estimated 78,000 utility customers in Southern California hadpower outages Saturday and some 1,400 tourists had to spend thenight on Catalina when the wind closed Avalon Harbor to the boatsthat ferry island visitors.   Hotels were full so tourists were sent to a local church. Thepastor farmed people out to parishioners, a high school gym and amovie theater, said Donna Hunsucker, administrative assistant atthe Chamber of Commerce. Boats resumed running Sunday, she said.   Strong thunderstorms rumbled across Southern Florida and theKeys on Sunday, with three-quarter-inch hail and gusts up to 63 mphreported near Marathon and Conch Key.   Elsewhere, central New England had light showers.   Monroe, La., posted a record low Sunday with a cool 43 degrees,four degrees off the former mark set in 1965.   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 27degrees at Yellowstone National Park to 86 at McAllen, Texas. Thelow for the day was 10 degrees at Truckee, Calif.   For Monday, occasionally heavy snow was forecast over centraland eastern Wyoming, south-central Montana and the northernColorado Rockies. Scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecastfrom the northern Plains through Kansas into northwestern Texas.Widespread showers were forecast across the northern Pacific Coastregion, with scattered showers across northern Maine.   Highs only in the 30s were predicted across much of Wyoming; inthe 40s and 50s from the Pacific Northwest to the northern andcentral Rockies, and across central and northern New England; inthe 80s from central and eastern Texas through the lowerMississippi Valley and Gulf Coast region to southern Florida, andin the Arizona deserts; in the mid 90s to 100 across inland areasof southern Texas; and in the 60s or 70s across much of the rest ofthe nation.</TEXT></DOC>
