The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had dropped a total of 32.19 points in the previous two sessions, went up 13.34 to 2110.60.    Broader market averages also posted solid gains. Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.53 to 270.00 and the New York Stock Exchange composite index added 0.76 to 152.56.    The market rallied at the opening in line with gains registered by U.S. stocks in Europe, where Wall Street's declines earlier in the week and a retreat in the dollar had led investors to do some buying.    Once the early round of bargain-hunting was over, stocks drifted in positive territory as the additional buying that was needed for the market to extend its gains proved elusive. Buyers finally emerged late in the session, however, and pushed stocks to session highs.    Market activity continued to poke along at the sluggish pace set earlier this week, as Big Board volume rose only slightly to 152 million shares from 144.1 million Tuesday. There were 849 gaining issues, 617 losers and 507 issues unchanged.    With the Dow Jones industrials hovering near the 2100 level since mid-June, market participants say a growing sense of boredom and frustration is taking hold among investors.    &quot;The market's kind of stuck,&quot; said Jon Groveman, head of equity trading at Ladenburg, Thalmann andamp; Co. &quot;Everyone who has wanted to do something has probably done something in this trading range.&quot;    While Mr. Groveman noted that second-quarter corporate earnings reports have generally been strong, he said, &quot;it's really a battle between interest rates and earnings right now, and it seems to be a draw.&quot;    Rates have been on an upward path this month, with the yield on the Treasury's long bond rising from 8.85% at the end of June to its current level of 9.23%. That trend will have to be reversed, he said, in order for the stock market to stage any meaningful advance.    Alfred E. Goldman, an analyst at A.G. Edwards andamp; Sons, St. Louis, said the market needs some kind of catalyst. &quot;Every market participant is sitting here and waiting for someone else to get something going,&quot; he said.    David Dreman, managing director at Dreman Value Management, said the market continues to be unsettled by various concerns, particularly signs of building pressure for higher inflation and interest rates, and is also overreacting to any second-quarter results that prove disappointing.    &quot;The psychology gives you some terrific opportunities,&quot; Mr. Dreman said. &quot;Any kind of bad news in this kind of nervous environment will drive a stock down more than in a calm market.&quot;    Aside from those issues, he said, stocks are &quot;probably somewhere in the area that they should be&quot; and don't appear to be headed for a fall, given the potential for further strength in corporate earnings.    Polaroid, the target of a $40-a-share takeover bid from Shamrock Holdings, surged 6 to 40 in Big Board composite trading, on volume of more than 6.1 million shares. Shamrock Holdings also filed suit to invalidate Polaroid's leveraged employee stock ownership plan, announced last week as part of a series of steps to boost shareholder value. The plan would acquire 10 million common shares, or about a 14% stake. An investor group headed by Shamrock has bought about five million Polaroid shares.    Honda Motor soared 24 7/8 to 167 5/8, with traders telling the Dow Jones Professional Investor Report that the surge resulted from a rotation toward the export-oriented auto sector in the Tokyo stock market.    Other Japanese stocks also moved higher, reflecting the Tokyo market's rebound from its sharpest drop of the year Tuesday. Matsushita Electric gained 14 1/4 to 202 1/4, Hitachi added 10 to 139 3/4, Kyocera rose 4 7/8 to 83 and Sony went up 2 1/8 to 41 1/4. The stocks trade in the U.S. in the form of American Depositary Receipts.    McGraw-Hill surged 3 3/4 to 64 5/8 amid rumors that MCA may be interested in acquiring the company and that British publisher Robert Maxwell is accumulating shares. Traders said that the stock also attracted some buying on a technical basis. McGraw-Hill and MCA declined comment on the speculation; a Maxwell spokesman wasn't available for comment.    Maytag jumped 2 1/2 to 24 5/8 on volume of 2 million shares. Rumors that the company may propose a leveraged buy-out at $30 a share fueled the trading, the Professional Investor Report said. Analysts said they were skeptical of the rumors, which have surfaced periodically, and the company declined comment.    Calmat fell 3 1/2 to 34. The company's board adopted a restructuring plan giving Onoda Cement of Japan, which plans to acquire up to six million Calmat common shares, the option to take over its California Portland Cement unit in exchange for the stock. The plan also calls for the sale of some real estate development assets and a buy-back of shares.    Unilever N.V., which has been rumored to be considering a $4 billion offer for Beatrice, gained 2 1/8 to 55. Beatrice said its talks with an unidentified buyer had broken down and the company, for the first time since April 1986, isn't for sale.    Marsh andamp; McLennan, whose second-quarter earnings of $1.06 a share were unchanged from a year ago, lost 1 1/4 to 54 3/4. A decline in earnings was offset by a lower number of average shares outstanding.    The American Stock Exchange index added 0.79 to 309.18. Total trading volume was about 8.5 million shares, compared with 10.9 million Tuesday.    Winston Furniture jumped 1 3/4 to 11 1/2, after it said it agreed to merge with River Capital for $27.9 million in cash and notes. The deal would give shareholders $12 a share in cash and $2.25 principal amount of a 10% subordinated note, due in eight years, for each share.    Hard Rock International added 7/8 to 7 7/8. The company said it agreed to be acquired by Pleasurama PLC in a transaction that would give holders of the company's American Depositary Shares about $8.47 a share.    Technitrol Inc. lost 1 to 28 7/8, after reporting flat earnings of 63 cents a share for the second quarter. </TEXT></DOC>
