(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Bacteria discovered growing at thebottom of a lake in what once was the throat of a volcano is thestrongest evidence yet that warm water is flowing into the lake,two researchers say.   That discovery by Jack Dymond and Bob Collier of Oregon StateUniversity puts them in the middle of a controversy involvingproposed geothermal energy development near the 1,932-foot-deepCrater Lake, which is the main part of a national park.   The National Park Service and some environmental groups areconcerned that drilling for underground hot water or steam couldaffect the lake, formed when a volcano exploded and collapsed intoitself.   Dymond and Collier announced Friday, after three weeks ofexploring Crater Lake in a one-man submarine, that they had foundevidence that hydrothermal vents, or hot springs, do exist on thelake floor.   ``The main focus of that venting was around some large bacterialmats, an exotic lifeform that we don't believe exist in other partsof the lake,'' Dymond said at a news conference.   He said the mats were ``clearly associated with warm waters thatare coming up through the rocks.''   Dymond said temperatures recorded at the mats were almost 11degrees warmer than the surrounding water.   California Energy Co. is trying to tap the geothermal potentialof the area, still warm from past volcanic activity, butlegislation that would place Crater Lake National Park on a list ofother national parks with ``significant hydrothermal features'' isnow pending in Congress. Such a designation could halt drillingleases outside the park.   Determining if there is a link between the vent area and thesite of the proposed geothermal energy plant in Winema NationalForest some 4{ miles away would be an ``extremely difficultproblem'' even with the most modern scientific equipment, Dymondsaid.   But he emphasized that the bacterial mats are the best evidenceyet of vents because the mats ``are a lifeform that is not based onphotosynthesis ... but is based on the chemicals and chemicalenergy that's available within the fluids that are coming up fromwithin the rocks.''   Collier described the bacterial mats, first found at a depth ofabout 1,500 feet, as ``big clumps of cotton plastered over the faceof a wall.''   The potential impact of the research on geothermal development``would be pure speculation at this time,'' said Peter Thompson,chief ranger for the National Park Service at Crater Lake.   Joe LaFleur, a geologist with California Energy, said Fridaythat he still doesn't believe there is enough evidence to confirmthe theory that heated ground water is entering the lake, primarilyfilled by rain and snowmelt.   Regardless, LaFleur said the company's proposed geothermal planwould not affect the lake or the park.   The research is part of a 10-year study of Crater Lake by thePark Service, which will end in 1992. This summer's research wasfunded by a $225,000 Park Service grant.</TEXT></DOC>
