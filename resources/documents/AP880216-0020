(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Midnight voters in the New Hampshiremountain hamlet of Dixville Notch gave Republican George Bush andDemocrat Richard Gephardt the winning votes in the nation's 1988leadoff presidential primary.   More often than not, Dixville's votes have been a bellwether forcandidates seeking the presidential nomination.   Bush received 11 votes, Gephardt 4. In the rest of theRepublican field, Bob Dole had 6, Jack Kemp 5, Pete du Pont 2,Alexander Haig 2, Pat Robertson 1.   Among Democrats, Paul Simon received 3. No other Democratsreceived votes.   ``In the primary, Dixville has a pretty good record in choosingthe eventual candidates for each party,'' Town Clerk Tom Tillotsonsaid of past elections. ``It's just when we came to November, we'dfrequently be in the wrong party.''   Since 1960, Dixville Notch voters have sided with the loser inall but three presidential elections. They picked the winners in1972, when they favored Richard Nixon over George McGovern, and in1980 and 1984, when they sided with Ronald Reagan.   Few residents of the resort town in northern New Hampshire werewilling to discuss in advance how they might cast their ballots.   ``Because so many people are asking, the voters tend to not becommittal, even amongst themselves,'' said Tillotson, a supporterof Vice President George Bush.   Tillotson's father, Neil, came up with the idea in 1960 ofmaking Dixville Notch the first town in the first primary state tocast ballots.   Now 89 and the town moderator, the elder Tillotson _ who ownsThe Balsams resort hotel where the votes are cast and a surgicalglove factory that is the town's only industry _ incorporatedDixville Notch that year to push the village into the nationalspotlight.   Every four years, most of the candidates or their surrogatesmake their way five hours north of Boston to Dixville Notch,population 47, to woo the handful of voters living 15 miles southof the Quebec border. They are followed by more reporters,photographers and TV camera crews than there are residents in town.   Residents take seriously their place in political history. Theymake sure to be in their voting booths by 11:45 p.m. so they candrop their ballots into the ballot box at the stroke of midnight.</TEXT></DOC>
