The Saudi monarch attributed the instability of oil prices toattempts by ``some'' to sell at discount prices, and expressed hopethat adherence will be strict to production and price rulings laiddown by the 13-nation OPEC.   He affirmed that the kingdom ``has never at any time violatedany agreement related to oil,'' thus adding yet another officialdenial to ongoing reports that Saudi Arabia was also violating OPECprices and selling at a discount because of the weak market.   Fahd did not name any of the member states of the OPEC cartelthat he accused of cheating on the rulings laid by OPEC for morethan a year and designed to strengthen oil prices around an 18dollars for benchmark crude.   At Saudi Arabia's request, the five-member OPEC pricingcommittee is meeting in Vienna on Saturday to consider ways andmeans of firming up the world market's flagging prices.   Fahd's call for ``solidarity'' among OPEC member states wasapparently aimed at pre-empting outbursts of inter-OPEC criticismto help the Vienna gathering formulate the proper recommendations.   On Thursday, Iranian oil minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh accusedSaudi Arabia of trying to destabilize the oil market by notagreeing to have the Vienna meeting held at an earlier date.   He said that Saudi Arabia blocked a call three months ago byIran to have the pricing committee convene. Committee members areoil ministers of Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Venezuela, Nigeria andAlgeria.   Saudi Oil Minister Hisham Nazer will be in Vienna after callingon two major non-OPEC oil producers _ Mexico and Britain _ seekingtheir cooperation in helping stabilize the market by restrainingtheir output.   Saudi Arabia is the leading member of the cartel and alonepossesses at least one-fifth of the world's proven oil reserves.Fahd stressed this point in his address saying that the kingdom``now is one of the major countries with reserves in the groundthat can suffice it for 200 years according to the estimates ofworld experts.''</TEXT></DOC>
