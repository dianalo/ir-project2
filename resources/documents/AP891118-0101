(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   NASA launched its lastunmanned rocket Saturday to sent a satellite on a mission to studyhow stars and galaxies evolved from the ``big bang'' that createdthe universe 15 billion years ago.   ``It was a joyful ride,'' Dennis McCarthy, deputy projectmanager, said after the $150 million Cosmic Background Explorerspacecraft was placed in a orbit by a 116-foot, two-stage Deltarocket.   Excessive wind between 17,000 and 20,000 feet delayed theblastoff for 10 minutes, but at 6:34 a.m. the $70 million rocketlifted off from Space Launch Complex 2 and thundered into clearskies above this coastal military base.   ``It was magnificent,'' NASA spokesman C.J. Fenrick said. ``Therocket as it was rising appeared like a bright fluorescent light,and about seven seconds later we heard the sound of the rockets andsaw a spiraling contrail of smoke.''   The rocket's nine strap-on boosters fell into the Pacific Oceanwest of the Channel Islands.   About an hour later, the Explorer was safely in a 559-mile-highorbit after it was released by the Delta's second stage. Secondslater, the Explorer deployed its antennas and large solar powerpanels to reach its full 16-by-28-foot size.   The rocket is the last expendable, unmanned rocket that NASAplans to launch. Except for space shuttles, all future NASApayloads will be launched by either Air Force or privately ownedrockets.   After a 30-day shakedown, the 4,850-pound Explorer will startmeasuring microwaves, heat and other ``cosmic backgroundradiation'' left over from the big bang _ the explosion scientistssay created the universe about 15 billion years ago.   ``It is the first space mission ever launched to probe theearliest stages of the universe,'' said deputy project scientistNancy Boggess. ``We'll reach back further than any telescope orspace mission has done before, back to the time before there werestars, before there were galaxies _ a time when the universe wasvery young.''   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration hopes Explorerwill produce the most comprehensive observations ever of the earlyuniverse and the processes that shaped it to form stars andgalaxies.   ``It really is a search for our ultimate roots,'' Boggess said.``Our planet is only 4{ billion years old. The universe is mucholder. It would be nice to know when did stars and galaxies formfrom which our own planet and solar system formed.''   NASA once planned to launch the Explorer from a space shuttle,but diverted it to the Delta after the 1986 Challenger explosion.   NASA stopped buying rockets in the early 1980s and decided tolaunch payloads from shuttles after its booster inventory wasexhausted. After the Challenger explosion, the space agencyadmitted it was wrong to rely on the shuttle. But then-PresidentReagan ordered the agency to stop launching commercial payloads andgive such business to private industry.   Launch commentator George Diller said the rocket that carriedthe Explorer was the 183rd Delta launched by NASA, the 189th Deltaever launched _ including those sent into space by the Air Forceand private companies _ and the 339th expendable rocket of any typelaunched by NASA.   To measure cosmic background radiation during its one- totwo-year mission, the Explorer will use the most sensitivedetectors of their types.   Scientists believe that at the instant of creation, a singlepoint of matter exploded into a hot, dense and extraordinarilyuniform sphere of gas containing electrically charged particles.That sphere eventually developed lumpiness that spawned thegalaxies and stars.   The sphere still is expanding. By measuring radiation from thedistant sphere, the Explorer will actually look back in time.   In addition to the satellite and rocket, Explorer project costsinclude $160 million for personnel at NASA's Goddard Space FlightCenter in Maryland and about $20 million for operations and dataanalysis through the end of the mission, agency officials said.</TEXT></DOC>
