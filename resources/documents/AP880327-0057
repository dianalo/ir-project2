(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Baby M surrogate motherhood case isto draw to a close in a courtroom here Monday, but elsewhereproblems will be just beginning for two people who look and actlike Mary Beth Whitehead and William Stern.   By coincidence, producers are to film a scene for a upcomingtwo-part TV miniseries on the Baby M case in a New Jersey Turnpikerest area at the same time the real-life litigants are to be incourt for a visitation hearing.   The hearing was ordered by the state Supreme Court to determinehow much Mrs. Whitehead may visit Baby M, now legally known asMelissa Stern.   ``To some extent it's a sad coincidence,'' said Ilene Berg,executive producer of the film, which is scheduled to be broadcastin May on ABC. ``It's sad that this is still not resolved, thatit's never going to be perfect.''   The producers were scheduled to film one of the early meetingsof Stern and Mrs. Whitehead, now known as Mrs. Whitehead-Gouldafter her second marriage, at a rest area about 8 miles south ofthe Bergen County courthouse.   The two used to meet there before they would drive together to aclinic in New York City where Mrs. Whitehead-Gould was inseminatedwith Stern's sperm as part of a $10,000 surrogate contract.   The scene is part of a four-hour miniseries that covers theintroduction of the Sterns and Whiteheads, the birth of Baby M, thesurrogate mother's flight to Florida with the child after shedecided she couldn't give up the baby, and the lower court custodytrial which Mrs. Whitehead-Gould lost.   At the end of the film, an update will tell of the state SupremeCourt decision that reversed most of the lower court ruling,granting custody of the baby to Stern but restoring Mrs.Whitehead-Gould's parental rights.   The highway rest area scene is the last to be filmed. The restof the movie was shot in a Van Nuys, Calif., soundstage whereproducers built a replica of the Bergen County courtroom where theBaby M case was played out.   Ms. Berg said the coincidence of the New Jersey filming on thesame day as the visitation hearing was a bit of good fortune forthe miniseries.   ``It shows, if anything, that our movie is still very timely,''she said.   Since neither side in the Baby M dispute agreed to take part inthe movie, producers wrote the script from court documents and newsreports. They said they tried to take no sides in the battle,letting the facts speak for themselves.   ``I expect people will be arguing about this after it (themovie) is over,'' said producer Gordon Freedman.   Actress Jo Beth Williams, seen in ``The Big Chill'' and ``TheDay After,'' plays Mrs. Whitehead-Gould, while actor John Sheaplays Stern and soap opera actress Robin Strasser plays Stern'swife, Elizabeth.   Hill Street Blues' Bruce Weitz plays the surrogate mother'sfirst husband, Richard Whitehead; actress Anne Jackson plays BabyM's legal guardian, Lorraine Abraham; and Dabney Coleman of ``TheSlap Maxwell Story'' plays the Sterns' attorney, Gary Skoloff.   Ms. Williams said she studied for the part by reading courtdocuments and newspaper clippings, and watching television newsreports.   In playing Mrs. Whitehead-Gould, the actress said, she foundthat the surrogate mother was neither a victim nor a heroine.   ``It's difficult to put a single label on her,'' Ms. Williamssaid. ``She's a woman who was put in a very difficult situation.Some of what Mary Beth did was impulsive. But it was out ofdesperation.   ``I feel very strongly for both sides of this story. They bothhave been through tremendous pain.''</TEXT></DOC>
