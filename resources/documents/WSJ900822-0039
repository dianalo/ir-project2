Abrams, chairman and chief executive officer.   The loss will amount to eight cents to 10 cents a share. Ayear ago, the company had net income of $192,320, or sixcents a share. Sales are expected to range from $16.5 millionto $17.5 million, up from $12.9 million.</LP><TEXT>   The Atlanta construction, manufacturing and real estateconcern blamed the loss squarely on lower shipments of storefixtures. Mr. Abrams said that certain shipments the companyhad expected to make in the quarter were delayed and will be&quot;moved back further&quot; in the year.   Mr. Abrams stressed, though, that the construction andreal estate businesses were profitable. &quot;We expect allsegments to be profitable in the second quarter {ending Oct.31},&quot; he said.   Mr. Abrams conceded that the biggest business --construction -- has considerable exposure to increasing oilprices, but said he believes the company is better poised tohandle the effects than it was in the mid-1970s. Contractshave shorter terms now, typically about six months, whichallow Abrams to make more timely energy-cost estimates whenpreparing contracts.</TEXT></DOC>
