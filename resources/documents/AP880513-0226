The chamber voted 83-6 approval of an amendment outlining awide-ranging anti-drug plan for the military.   The proposal provides more surveillance by Air Force and Navyplanes, a bigger anti-drug role for the National Guard and morePentagon helicopters for the Coast Guard and Customs Service.   The most controversial provision would require Navy vessels totrack suspected drug boats in international waters and would allowNavy officers to arrest suspected drug traffickers. The officerswould be temporarily ``deputized'' by Coast Guard officers whowould be aboard for that purpose.   The anti-drug provision was the main unresolved issue as theSenate worked toward approval of a bill authorizing defensespending for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1.   Passage by the Democratic-controlled chamber will send the billto a House-Senate conference committee to reconcile differencesbetween it and the separate Pentagon bill approved Wednesday by theHouse. Both measures authorize $299.5 billion for the Pentagon.   One major difference will be the anti-drug provision. The Housemeasure orders President Reagan to have the military``substantially halt'' the flow of illegal drugs into the UnitedStates.   ``I think we have a chemical war being directed against theUnited States,'' said Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the ArmedServices Committee.   But he warned that the military help won't solve the problem.``Let no one believe that we're going to pass a piece oflegislation and solve the drug problem, but we can improve it. ...I think we all know the drug epidemic in this country is far pastthe stage where interdiction came stop it.''   Other senators warned that drugs have become a national securitymenace, but they also acknowledged that the military plan won'tsolve the problem.   The loudest critic was Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, who accused hiscolleagues of ``posturing on this.''   ``We all get up, posture, make our little statements, and itisn't going to make any difference,'' said Glenn, arguing that theU.S. lacks a coordinated or effective nationwide anti-drug program.   ``It's absolutely ludicrous to think this will solve theproblem,'' he said.   The Pentagon has resisted a larger role in the war againstdrugs, saying the military is not trained or equipped for theassignment.   The Senate anti-drug plan was hammered out in three days ofmeetings by senators who put together parts of two competingproposals. Also involved in the talks were Defense Secretary FrankCarlucci and Attorney General Edwin Meese III.   Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., said, ``We have reached a pointwhere drugs are becoming an enemy equal to any foreign enemy.''   Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., said he formally opposed involvingthe military, but said he changed his mind because ``the drug flowhas reached flood tide.''   Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas said the plan``shows that we're serious about drugs.''   An 1878 law, the Posse Comitatus Act, prohibits the militaryfrom enforcing civilian laws, although it was amended in 1981 topermit the military to provide more help to civilian anti-drugagencies. Military planes and ships now pass along surveillanceinformation on suspected drug traffickers to law enforcementofficials.   But the Posse Comitatus Act is only effective inside theterritorial borders of the United States.   Voting against the amendment were Sens. Bill Bradley, D-N.J.;Alan Cranston, D-Calif.; Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.; Dan Evans,R-Wash.; John Glenn, D-Ohio; and Lowell Weicker, R-Conn.   Not voting were Sens. Joseph Biden, D-Del.; Albert Gore,D-Tenn.; Orrin Hatch, R-Utah; Mark Hatfield, R-Ore.; Chic Hecht,R-Nev.; David Karnes, R-Neb.; Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan.; John Kerry,D-Mass.; Warren Rudman, R-N.H.; Paul Simon, D-Ill.; and AlanSimpson, R-Wyo.   All other senators voted in favor of the amendment.   As it worked through the bill Friday, the Senate:</TEXT><TEXT>   _Killed, 56-37, a proposal by Sen. Edward M.
