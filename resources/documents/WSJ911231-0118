While hostilities are at a low point throughout Asia,tensions persist in some areas, particularly the Koreanpeninsula. U.S. military cuts are therefore a source ofconcern to some nations, especially after the Philippineslast week ordered U.S. forces to vacate the giant Subic BayNaval Station by the end of 1992.</LP><TEXT>   In particular, when President Bush meets Japanese PrimeMinister Kiichi Miyazawa in Tokyo, opinion leaders inSoutheast Asia will be keeping their fingers crossed. A rockyencounter over trade would be terrible news for them: Itmight signal the beginning of the end of the U.S. securityrole in Asia.   &quot;U.S.-Japan relations are the pillar of security in thispart of the world,&quot; says Hadi Soesastro, director ofIndonesia's Center for Strategic and International Studies inJakarta. &quot;When you see the intensity of Japan bashing on thepart of some Americans and the feelings we sense in Japantoward the U.S., it is quite worrying to us.&quot;   A rocky encounter isn't likely, but Asia's angst isunderstandable. If the U.S.-Japan alliance were no longer tohold the U.S. in Asia, many Asian analysts think America'seconomic problems and the resurgence of American isolationismcould mean eventual disengagement from Asia. &quot;It's verylikely that there will be no U.S. forces in Asia in 10years,&quot; says Lin Bih Jaw, director of the Institute ofInternational Relations at National Chengchi University inTaiwan.   U.S. disengagement would create a vacuum that the Japanesemight be forced to fill. For Japan, the sea lanes areeconomic life lines. Somebody has to protect them. SoutheastAsians, with their memories of Japan's ambitions 50 yearsago, would much prefer it be the U.S., whose presence limitsthe need for Japan to extend its military power in theregion.   Many Japanese take umbrage at such thinking. Yet Japaneseofficials sing a similar tune when they talk about Japan'spolitical and diplomatic ambitions in Asia. They want to havea bigger voice in Asian affairs, but they know that afrightened Asia will be loath to listen. The U.S.-Japanrelationship eases Asia's fears.   &quot;Some Japanese say, `If U.S.-Japan relations go sour, wecan always go back to Asia,'&quot; says Yukio Satoh, a seniorForeign Ministry official. &quot;There are no Asian countries thatwould welcome a Japan that left the U.S.-Japan alliance.&quot;   This sounds so self-demeaning that some foreigners doubtthat Japanese officials really believe it. But it'sconsistent with Japanese conduct. Why else does Japancontinue to strive to keep U.S. forces on its soil, eventhough the Soviet threat has evaporated? This year, theJapanese will bear 45% of the cost of keeping the U.S.military in Japan, excluding salaries. By 1995, the Japanesesupport level is expected to rise to 70%.   Or take Japan's coy reaction to Malaysia's proposals tocreate some sort of East Asian Economic Caucus. Japan'sresponse was, in essence: &quot;We can't. Washington would beunhappy.&quot;   Why would a sovereign, independent nation behave this way?Students of post-war history say Japan, in a sense, gave up ameasure of independence in the early 1950s. Its choicesemerging from the U.S. military occupation were unarmedneutrality, as the left advocated; full independence and fullresponsibility for defense, as the right desired; and thepractical middle course Japan chose: Concentrate on economicdevelopment and let the U.S. provide the defense.   Japan is now fully capable of providing its own defense.But an independent defense posture frightens many Japanese,who worry that civilian control of the military will fail, asit did in the 1930s. Even an innocuous gesture, such asJapan's moves to take part in United Nations' peacekeepingoperations, stirs these fears.   With a strong desire to be more active in Asiapolitically, with a public that is skittish about theJapanese military and with an Asia that feels the same way,it isn't surprising that Tokyo finds the U.S.-Japanrelationship in its interests.   Apart from the U.S. military presence, many nations,particularly in Southeast Asia, are encouraging U.S.businesses to step up their activities to offset Japan'seconomic clout. &quot;What's important is to stress to PresidentBush that we want the fullest American involvement in Asia .. . concentrated on the most strategic area -- which iseconomics,&quot; says Noordin Sopiee, director-general ofMalaysia's Institute of Strategic and International Studies,a government-funded think tank.   But Japan remains the focal point of the trip. At the topof Mr. Bush's agenda in Japan is trade in automobiles. Mr.Bush is under tremendous political pressure at home to dosomething about the $40 billion U.S. trade deficit withJapan, of which automobiles and auto parts account forthree-quarters.   About half of the 18 top U.S. executives President Bush isbringing with him to Asia represent automobile-relatedcompanies. But in Japanese eyes, it turns the trip -- whichthe Japanese had hoped would focus on the U.S.-Japan &quot;globalpartnership,&quot; -- into a grubby trade mission.   Yet the Japanese also recognize the problems of the U.S.economy and the difficulties they could pose for Mr. Bush inan election year. Almost any of Mr. Bush's presidentialchallengers, Republican or Democrat, would likely take a muchtougher line against Japan than Mr. Bush, a longtime advocateof free trade. To avoid that, there is a feeling in Tokyothat Japan must come up with trade concessions, particularlyin the auto and autoparts field.   Auto companies are announcing new contracts to buy U.S.auto parts almost daily, and the Japanese news media are fullof trial-balloons, ranging from measures to boost U.S. carsales in Japan to steps that would reduce Japanese carexports to the U.S. It isn't clear what the government willdo, but Prime Minister Miyazawa, addressing Japanese businessleaders last week, said, &quot;We have to do as much as we can&quot; todeal with the auto problem.</TEXT></DOC>
