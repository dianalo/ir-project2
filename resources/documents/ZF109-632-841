ScheierandM;Many corporate systems managers dream of cashing in on their expertise inleading-edge technology by starting their own companies.andM;Two OS/2 experts at System One Corp., a developer of airline reservationsoftware, have done just that, creating a startup that offers makers ofadd-in boards a fast and low-risk way to enter the OS/2 market.andM;In December 1989, Mark Ahlstrom and Bruce Keller formed Keller Group Inc. tosell OS/2 device drivers and application programming interfaces to add-inboard vendors so those vendors could make their products run under OS/2without a big investment in software development.andM;Keller also provides OS/2 technical support for the boards' users.andM;The pair develop OS/2 software that, for example, allows a fax board to dialtelephone numbers &quot;for no cash up front,&quot; said Ahlstrom.andP;  The two hope tomake their money on royalties from sales of the boards.andM;&quot;Since Keller Group absorbs the development costs and requires no advance orguaranteed payments, we are bearing most of the risk of the emerging OS/2marketplace,&quot; said Ahlstrom.andM;Their St. Paul, Minn., firm has already signed contracts with three makers offacsimile or voice-processing boards for PCs, including Brooktrout TechnologyInc., a Needham, Mass., maker of fax and voice cards.andM;Brooktrout National Sales Manager Mike Donoghue said his company lacks thein-house expertise to write OS/2 software.andP;  &quot;We had a customer need (a boardto run in an OS/2 system) and needed it in a short time frame.andP;  They did agreat job,&quot; he said.andM;In many ways, Keller Group is a typical software startup.andP;  Ahlstrom, thepresident, and Keller, the vice president of technology, are the onlyemployees and work out of Keller's home.andM;Revenues so far have been &quot;quite minimal,&quot; said Ahlstrom, since the royaltieshave not yet started to flow.andP;  But the pair have an advantage over otherentrepreneurs because this is their second time down the startup trail.andM;In 1985, the two were among the four founders of Airplan Systems Inc., aChicago-based vendor of a DOS application that allowed corporate travelers totap into airline reservation systems.andM;In 1987, Airplan was sold to System One, the computer automation arm of TexasAir Corp., and Ahlstrom and Keller began developing OS/2 applications forSystem One.andM;But corporate life soured for the pair, and late last year they resigned toform Keller Group.andP;  The money from the sale of Airplan to System One isbankrolling Keller Group, allowing its owners to be able to wait forroyalties to start coming in.andM;For would-be software vendors without a cash cushion, Ahlstrom recommendedmaking a solid, working prototype before going out to raise money.andP;  &quot;If youdon't have enough initiative to whip up a prototype in a reasonably shortamount of time, why should people believe you [can] develop a full-blownproduct?&quot; he said.andM;The technical geniuses building the product should also &quot;make sure they havea good marketing partner who is working on those issues at least as much asthey're working on the technology,&quot; he said.andM;Finally, Ahlstrom suggested hiring a good lawyer who can research such issuesas whether to patent software.andM;&quot;The most common way to get equity out of a company is to sell it,&quot; he said.andM;A patent on the company's software may be one of its most valuable assets, headded.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
