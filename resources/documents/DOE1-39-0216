In this method, since the change of themagnetic field occurs as a transition from a stable persistent-currentstate to another, no power supply is required in the two states to keepthe magnetic fields constant. Also in this method, no unstabel transientphenomenon is generated in principle, and a sharp step-like change ofmagnetic field is produced. A step magnetic-field change of 2.1T wasexperimentally obtained in a time interval of about 600 ms without anyunstability. It is expected that the time constant of the transitioncan be reduced more than two orders of magnitude when the characteristicsof the supercnducting switches are improved. The present method is especiallyuseful in obtaining a larage change of high magnetic field.</TEXT></DOC>
