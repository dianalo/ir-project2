Valukas' four years as U.S. attorney,he has presided over an office that has indicted more than 270public officials, government employees and others on corruptioncharges.   Valukas, 45, is again in the spotlight for his role in the recentmarket-fraud investigation of the leading U.S. commodities exchanges.   Observers say no one in Chicago is better prepared to tackle it.   U.S. law enforcement officials are investigating allegations thatas many as 100 brokers and traders systematically cheated customersout of millions of dollars on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange andthe Chicago Board of Trade. No indictments have been announced andValukas has declined comment.   Valukas has a vast knowledge of commodities trading, but itwasn't built solely as a prosecutor.   He learned much by defending traders.   As a private attorney at the Chicago law firm Jenner andamp; Block,Valukas represented brokers in criminal cases and in disciplinaryproceedings before the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, theagency that oversees futures trading.   Eugene Wedoff, a U.S. bankruptcy judge who worked with Valukas atJenner andamp; Block, recalled at least one instance in which Valukassuccessfully defended a Board of Trade broker accused of breakingcommodities laws.   ``By the time he left Jenner andamp; Block, he probably knew a muchabout commodities law as anyone in the city,'' Wedoff said.   Chicago attorney John Troelstrup agreed Tuesday. ``When he cameto the U.S. attorney's office, Valukas was probably one of the mostknowledgeable and experienced ... in terms of commoditiesexperience,'' said Troelstrup, who is representing at least one ofthose subpoenaed in the commodities probe.   When Valukas, a Chicago native whose father was a judge, wasnamed U.S. attorney for the northern district of Illinois in May1985, he pledged to make prosecuting white-collar corruption apriority.   ``Corruption is an epidemic-proportion problem in Chicago,''Valukas said. ``It would be hard for me to imagine a city in whichthere was more corruption.''   He joined the U.S. attorney's office as an assistant prosecutorin 1970. He joined Jenner andamp; Block in 1977 but returned to publicservice in 1981 when Gov. James R. Thompson appointed him to headthe Metropolitan Fair and Exposition Authority.   Valukas served as an attorney on Thompson's re-election campaignin 1982, and in 1985, the governor lobbied heavily to make him U.S.attorney.   Tactics used in the commodities probe _ ``wired'' FBI agentsposing as traders in the exchanges' trading pits secretly tapingalleged wrongdoing _ are familiar to Valukas.   His office has orchestrated elaborate sting operations withundercover agents paying off crooked police officers, judges andpoliticians, and taping it all on hidden recorders.   When he succeeded U.S. Attorney Dan Webb in 1985, Valukas tookover one of the most publicized investigations, Operation Greylord,a probe of corruption in the Cook County court system.   A key player in the probe was a southern Illinois judge broughtto Chicago. The judge hid a tape recorder in his cowboy boot and amicrophone in his judicial robes to document wrongdoing.   So far, 90 judges, lawyers and other court employees have beenindicted in the Greylord probe and 70 have been convicted. Severalcases are pending.   Operation Incubator, developed by Valukas and his assistants,uncovered influence-peddling at Chicago's City Hall. The key figurewas FBI ``mole'' Michael Raymond, whom the FBI taped making payoffsto politicians in Chicago and New York. Several former officialscharged in the probe are scheduled to go on trial in May.   Valukas is rumored to be planning to leave the U.S. attorney'soffice in the next few months. The Chicago Tribune reported Mondaythat he's eyeing a partner's position at a major Chicago law firm.   But Valukas has not publicly disclosed his plans.</TEXT></DOC>
