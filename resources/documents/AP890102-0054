I think the policy'sworking,'' said Elliott Abrams, assistant secretary of state forinter-American affairs.   ``It's a policy of putting pressure on (Cuban President Fidel)Castro to isolate him, to make his economic situation moredifficult, to try to force him out of Angola, to try to force him tomake human rights concessions. That's what's working,'' Abrams saidon the ABC-TV program ``Good Morning America.''   But Rep. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., interviewed on the sameprogram, said ``to have an American policy that is basically basedon the idea that we wish the revolution didn't happen, we wish thathe'd go away, is really foolish going into a fourth decade.''   Torricelli said he thinks a policy is needed that would requiresome reforms from Castro in exchange for an improved relationshipwith the United States, a policy that ``puts a real price on a newrelationship, a real price on his policies in Nicaragua and Angolaand human rights at home. We may find that that gets some results.''   Castro, celebrating the 30th anniversary of his revolution, saidin a televised speech Sunday night that it is ``socialism or death''for Cuba, as he rejected market-oriented economic reforms. Hisremarks seemed aimed at the Soviet Union and other Communistcountries that have been abandoning strict adherence to Marxistdoctrine.   Torricelli said that ``despite the rhetoric, I think there's somereason to believe there can be change.''   He said ``the difficulty here is that he doesn't understand whatnecessarily is required for better relations. And what(President-elect) Bush should be doing is spelling that out exactly.We want some change of policy in Nicaragua, we want him to continueto adhere to not aiding violent revolution in Latin America, we wantthe Angolan accords fulfilled, we want his promises kept onimmigration, we want human rights changes in Cuba.''   Abrams said that if Castro wants a changed relationship with theUnited States, ``probably his first real step has got to beimplementing'' the Angola agreement ``and taking the troops out.''   But, Abrams said, he thinks Castro is ``a first generationcommunist leader...who is unable to countenance a reduction in hispersonal power, real democracy, real change. It will take the nextgeneration coming, I think, for there to be real change in Cuba.''</TEXT></DOC>
