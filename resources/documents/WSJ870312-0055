A source familiar with the investigation said it centers on government antitrust decisions involving General Electric Co.'s $1.88 billion bid for Plessey Co., Hillsdown Holdings PLC's $760 million bid for Sandamp;W Berisford PLC, and Norton Opax PLC's $256 million purchase of McCorquodale PLC. GEC isn't connected to General Electric Co. of the U.S.    The investigation isn't related to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's insider-trading charges against a Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. official in London. The British government announced the insider-trading investigation last December. At that time, it didn't specify any government employees or companies involved. Speculation is that the probe is focusing on employees of Britain's Department of Trade and Industry, the Office of Fair Trading, and the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.    The mergers commission decides whether takeovers should proceed or be halted on the basis of whether they would cause reduced competition within an industry. The government referred the three takeover bids to the mergers panel.    A decision to refer a bid to the agency usually causes a drop in the target company's share price, and a gain in the share price of the bidding company. According to the source familiar with the inquiry, investigators suspect that government employees leaked the referral decisions in advance, allowing traders to make money or avoid losses. The source said suggestions that the information had been leaked came in British newspaper stories that predicted the referrals, with &quot;minute details&quot; of the decisions. </TEXT></DOC>
