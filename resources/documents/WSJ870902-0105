An Alcan spokesman said the employees are working under the previous contract, while negotiations on a new pact proceed between Alcan's Canadian smelting unit and union representatives. The talks began in June. &quot;We're optimistic we will get a settlement without a strike,&quot; the spokesman said.    The talks are being watched by industry officials and analysts because of the possible effect of a strike on world aluminum markets. The four smelters provide 60% of Alcan's Canadian smelting capacity and 5% of total free-world capacity.    Levis Desgagne, president of the Federations des Syndicats du Secteur Aluminium, which represents workers at three of the four smelters and at related rail, port and alumina installations, said talks are proceeding slower than expected.    &quot;At the rate we're going, it could still take some time&quot; to reach a settlement, he said. A decision hadn't been made on whether to take a strike vote, and the union continues to negotiate with the aim of reaching a new pact with Alcan, he said. The union can't legally strike unless it gives 48 hours' notice of a strike vote.    In 1984, the union came to an agreement with Alcan, without a strike, eight months after the the old pact expired.    The union's main demands in the current talks are for a ban on subcontracting and overtime, to create more union jobs.    Workers at the fourth smelter are represented by an affiliate of the Confederation of National Trade Unions. Their contract usually follows the agreement worked out with the other union.    John Tumazos, an analyst with Oppenheimer andamp; Co., said the fact that workers are remaining on the job indicates that the situation at Alcan isn't as serious as some thought and may lead to a softening in the price for aluminum. </TEXT></DOC>
