The two companies declined to comment yesterday on any aspect of their talks, but analysts speculated New York-based Warner might seek to acquire Culver City, Calif.-based Lorimar with stock or a combination of cash and stock. Analysts disagree widely on the value of Lorimar stock; estimates range from $13 a share to $20 a share. But based on yesterday's closing price of $15 for Lorimar's stock, analysts say the acquisition would cost Warner at least $600 million. Warner would also probably have to assume $550 million of Lorimar debt.    In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Lorimar's stock closed up $2.50 on volume of 3.5 million shares; its stock was the most active on that exchange. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Warner's stock closed at $32.75, up 37.5 cents.    It isn't clear, however, that Lorimar desires a merger. The company recently adopted anti-takeover measures. In a statement yesterday, Lorimar said it has been approached in the past by various companies, and that its board and management haven't determined &quot;whether any business combination would be in the interests of its shareholders.&quot;    Analysts say Warner is unlikely to take any hostile action, and it isn't clear the company will find Lorimar so attractive after it examines its books later this week. For Warner, already one of the most successful and powerful players in the entertainment business, the main attraction of Lorimar appears to be its strength in making television progams produced directly for sale to television stations. Despite its strength in motion pictures, Warner lacks a strong television syndication business.    For Lorimar, meanwhile, Warner might prove to be the most friendly of several potential acquirers said to be circling the problem-plagued company. Lorimar had a loss of $82.6 million on revenue of $616.8 million last year and currently is embroiled in a scandal over its Karl-Lorimar home video unit. But merging Lorimar into Warner or any other company would end Lorimar Chairman Merv Adelson's dream of building his company into an entertainment powerhouse.    After the 1985 merger of Lorimar Inc. with Telepictures Corp., Mr. Adelson, with the help of investment banker Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., began an ambitious diversification strategy that quickly backfired and alienated many on Wall Street. Among other things, Mr. Adelson announced and then dropped plans to spend over $1 billion on television station acquisitions. He also entered the advertising agency business through acquisitions, and he began an expensive campaign to enter the movie business.    &quot;Merv started out thinking he was going to conquer Hollywood and be the kingpin,&quot; said Harold Vogel, an analyst at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. &quot;But the whole plan has started to self-destruct and unravel with one crisis after another.&quot;    Mr. Adelson even once hinted he might take a run at Warner. Before the merger with Telepictures, Lorimar indicated it owned about 2.5% of Warner and said it might buy as much as 15% in the open market. It never took further action, however.    Last year, in a reversal of its diversification strategy, Lorimar announced a restructuring plan, shedding such assets as its ad agencies to focus on television and motion picture production. But Lorimar has largely failed as a moviemaker, and analysts expect Warner would shut down its movie operations or fold them into its own Warner Bros. studio.    Likewise, Warner would be expected to absorb Lorimar's home video unit, which lost $53 million in the fourth quarter. Lorimar said former video division president Stuart Karl misled management by failing to disclose a policy of letting video dealers return unsold cassettes. Lorimar says sales were grossly overestimated as a result. Mr. Karl didn't return calls seeking comment.    Richard Simon, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., said, &quot;Warner will have to sit back and see if they can turn the massive Lorimar losses around.&quot; He estimated Lorimar would have to be able to earn at least $100 million &quot;at the operating level&quot; to justify a merger valued at $1 billion or more.    Alan Kassan, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Bros. Inc. said Lorimar's most attractive assets are such television programs as &quot;ALF&quot; and &quot;Perfect Strangers,&quot; which will likely fetch high prices from sales to television stations after their network runs. Lorimar is also one of the most successful producers of prime time programming, including &quot;Dallas,&quot; &quot;Knots Landing,&quot; and &quot;Falcon Crest,&quot; as well as such syndicated shows as &quot;The People's Court,&quot; &quot;Love Connection&quot; and &quot;Thundercats.&quot;    While some speculated Lorimar would hold out for a hefty premium over its stock price, John Tinker, an analyst at Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., said Lorimar is under growing financial pressure because of its high debt and losses. &quot;They are running out of money. They may have to do a deal,&quot; Mr. Tinker said.    Last month, Mr. Adelson said Lorimar has plenty of money despite its losses. He said at the time the company plans to take out a roughly $80 million mortgage on its MGM studio lot, which together with various asset sales would be expected to bring in $275 million to $300 million shortly.    ---                 Warner vs. Lorimar           Monthly Close in Dollars a Share                   How They Compare                (In millions of dollars)                                   Warner       Lorimar* 1987 Revenue                      $3,403        $857 1987 Net income (loss)               328        (145) Market value                       4,144         691   *Fiscal year ends in March; data are for 12 months ended Dec. 31</TEXT></DOC>
