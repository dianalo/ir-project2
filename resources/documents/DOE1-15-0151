<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-15-0151 </DOCNO><TEXT>The inelastic scattering of two structured systems: for example, an excitedatom and a molecule: is considered in the case of nonreactive collisions.Explicit formulas are presented for cross sections corresponding to transitionsbetween arbitrary eigenstates of the two isolated systems. These formulasare then used to derive cross sections for polarization transfer andmultipole relaxation in one system when the other system is unpolarized.Both space-fixed and body-fixed formulations are given. Explicit matrixelements are worked out for interactions such as occur between modelalkali-metal atoms and rigid-rotor diatomic molecules. An effective interactionmethod is also discussed and related to an adiabatic-state approach.</TEXT></DOC>
