Both sides said the secretary of state and the Soviet foreign minister were making progress toward completion of a superpower treaty calling for the elimination of intermediate-range nuclear missiles. A U.S. official said that Shultz and Shevardnazde had &quot;basically resolved&quot; a dispute over West German arms, and that only &quot;technical&quot; differences remained over verification procedures and missile-dismantling schedules. Shultz is to meet today with Gorbachev.    Reagan, at a news conference, said a date hadn't been set for a third summit with Gorbachev, but he expressed hope that such a meeting would occur.    ---   REAGAN WARNED Iran again about &quot;provocative acts&quot; in the Persian Gulf.    The president, in a nationally broadcast news conference, said the U.S. wasn't operating in the gulf &quot;to start a war,&quot; but would &quot;respond&quot; to Iran's attacks on shipping. Reagan's comments came after an Iranian missile, believed to have been a Chinese-made Silkworm, struck a Kuwaiti oil terminal. At least five people were wounded and the facility set ablaze in the missile strike. None of the U.S.-flagged tankers protected by Navy ships was in the area.

Wyoming Sen. Simpson, the GOP whip, said the Reagan nominee has &quot;no desire to prolong&quot; the squabbling over his confirmation. A majority of senators have announced opposition to Bork.    ---   Exiled Soviet poet Joseph Brodsky won the 1987 Nobel Prize in literature.

OSHA said design deficiencies and employer &quot;complacency&quot; were responsible for the L'Ambiance Plaza accident.    ---   The EPA proposed new standards to improve the safety of drinking water that comes from rivers, lakes and other surfacewater sources. The $2 billion plan would affect less than 5% of the nation's drinking-water systems, but is said to be among the most expensive cleanup programs to result from a 1986 law.    ---   Surgeon General Koop said an &quot;explosion&quot; of AIDS cases among heterosexuals isn't likely although the disease's greatest rate of increase is among that group. About 26% of AIDS victims are heterosexuals, but only 4% contracted the disease through heterosexual sex, according to U.S. data.    ---   Nancy Reagan returned to the White House, five days after undergoing a modified radical mastectomy.
