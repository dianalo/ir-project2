The actors, their language and even hair color are picked to fit the market. But the more such details change, the more the basic message about the product -- American Express cards -- is designed to remain the same.    It's a pan-European ad campaign, trying to appeal to consumers whose similarities may be many, but whose differences still count. American Express Co., like many big advertisers, thinks plotting a common strategy for selling to Europe's 320 million consumers makes increasing sense. &quot;We offer a niche product aimed at an upper-echelon group, and across Europe there are more similarities than dissimilarities&quot; in that group, says John Stuart, who heads the company's European charge-card marketing effort.    Spurred by talk of a unified market by 1992, more advertisers are trying to &quot;harmonize&quot; their marketing. &quot;The evolution is going to be quite speedy to the Europeanization of advertising and marketing,&quot; says Peter Scott, chief executive of WCRS Group PLC, a London-based advertising concern.    But agencies and clients are finding the process isn't simple -- only a few products or brands can be sold the same way everywhere. A few years ago, American Express transferred to some countries its long-running U.S. &quot;Do You Know Me?&quot; celebrity campaign, which played up the status of carrying an American Express card. Results were mixed, partly because many Europeans didn't know American Express and partly because they weren't in the habit of using credit cards.    Currently, three million American Express cards are issued in Europe vs. 19 million in the U.S. &quot;In Europe we decided we needed to work a little harder at communicating&quot; the advantages of the card, Mr. Stuart says.    The company's new European campaign reflects an unusual attempt to accommodate European differences. The company pooled ideas and budgets from each of its national units, but then let each country help shape the message.    That took an elaborate juggling act by the company and its ad agency, Ogilvy Group Inc. The new campaign's theme, stressing that carrying American Express brings &quot;privileges,&quot; parallels the U.S. campaign. On both sides of the ocean, the company is trying to fend off bank-issued credit cards.    For the European TV ad, Ogilvy's London agency wrote a script to illustrate what American Express considers the &quot;privileges.&quot; An executive loses his card and gets an immediate replacement with one phone call to a sympathetic operator. A bedraggled family shows up late at a hotel to find a room still waiting because of American Express's guarantee. A young man suddenly summoned abroad can take off in a hurry because American Express doesn't preset a spending limit.    But in each country a custom-tailored version makes the point with a different mix of characters and situations. Ogilvy's director shot some scenes as many as four times, replacing blonds cast for northern Europe with darker types for the Mediterranean. The French ad shows the restaurant scene, the English ad the bicycle shop. American Express's Italian unit insisted on a pet-shop scene with daddy using the card to buy his little girl a dog.    This sort of blending, Ogilvy reckons, is a first. The cost savings were significant, and the approach allows a small market like Austria to present as slick-looking an ad as the largest. Mr. Stuart declines to disclose the cost of the campaign, but says the production budget was less than half the cost of making separate ads for each country.    For magazines, Ogilvy's Frankfurt office produced a series of glossy spreads featuring attractive Europeans at play. Each ad comes with one or two approved texts, for translation by local agencies into the right language.    Striking a common theme, tricky as it is, is easier for American Express than for rivals Visa and MasterCard. Across Europe, the two bank credit cards are issued under varying names. Barclays PLC, the leading U.K. Visa issuer, promotes Barclaycard, while the French know Visa as Carte Bleue. &quot;We're differentiating ourselves in a way our competitors have trouble matching,&quot; Mr. Stuart says. </TEXT></DOC>
