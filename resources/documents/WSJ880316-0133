Dennis Ross, deputy assistant Treasury secretary for tax policy, made the suggestion at a House Ways and Means subcommittee hearing called to consider proposals designed to make insurance policies less attractive as investment vehicles. Single-premium life insurance policies in particular have become popular since the 1986 tax overhaul, which wiped out most other shelters.    At a separate hearing, Gov. James Blanchard announced that Michigan has received a favorable tax ruling from the Internal Revenue Service for its prepaid college-tuition plan, under which parents could prepay to the state an amount to guarantee tuition at a public college or university for their children. Also, the Treasury elaborated on its proposal for tax-deferred education savings bonds.    The Treasury didn't offer any specific proposals involving insurance. Mr. Ross, however, noted that the lack of rules designed to discourage the withdrawal of cash from investment-oriented life insurance policies contrasts with the treatment of withdrawals from Individual Retirement Accounts and deferred annuity contracts. He said, &quot;At least with respect to investment-oriented life insurance contracts, we see no valid policy reasons for the absence of similar restrictions on life insurance contracts.&quot;    The panel heard from a variety of groups and is considering a number of proposals, some of which would affect more than just limited-premium policies. A measure proposed by Rep. Fortney Stark (D., Calif.) and Rep. Willis Gradison (R., Ohio), for example, would tighten rules regarding loans and distributions from all life insurance policies.    Mr. Ross also suggested that Congress consider whether businesses have abused tax rules allowing them to deduct the interest on loans from life insurance policies. Mr. Ross expressed sympathy for a third approach, designed to curb tax abuses by tightening the definition of insurance policies, but said it might be difficult to devise an equitable tax change.    Gov. Blanchard said Michigan will begin selling contracts under its tuition guarantee program this spring. He said the program had been held up more than a year pending the IRS ruling, which said that parents won't have to pay tax on the interest earned on the investment made by the state.    A number of other states have been waiting for the IRS ruling in the Michigan case before proceeding with similar programs. In Michigan, parents, grandparents and others will be able to make a one-time, lump-sum payment or periodic fixed payments to prepay tuition for a child. The state will pool the funds, invest them and pay tuition costs for each child at a state college or university.    Gov. Blanchard discussed the ruling at a Senate Finance Committee hearing, where Don Chapoton, assistant Treasury secretary for tax policy, elaborated on the Reagan administration's proposal for college savings bonds. Under the program, which was proposed in the Reagan administration's budget request last month, families would get a tax exemption on interest earned on savings bonds as long as the bond proceeds were used to pay for a post-secondary education.    He said the exemption would phase out at income between $60,000 and $80,000. The phase-out would apply to parents' income if the parents have claimed the student as a dependent in any of the three previous years. Otherwise, the phase-out would be determined by the student's income.    He said that sales of the bonds are estimated at $4 billion to $5 billion a year and that the net cost of the program to the Treasury would be $10 million in 1989, rising to $200 million in the fifth year of the program. There would also be administrative costs, depending on how the program is carried out. </TEXT></DOC>
