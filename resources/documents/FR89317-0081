Background </ITAG>In August 1988, the Department completed recovery of $1,469,500 plus accruedinterest from the California SEA for claims arising from an audit of theSan Francisco Unified School District covering the period September 1,1973 through August 31,1975. The claims involved the SEA's administrationof Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (TitleI ), program that addressed the special educational needs of educationallydeprived children in areas with high concentrations of children from low-incomefamilies. Specifically, the LEA did not satisfy the Title I comparabilityrequirements in 45 CFR 116.26 (1973) that an LEA could receive Title Ifunds only if it used its State and local funds in each Title I area toprovide services that, taken as a whole, were at least comparable to servicesprovided in non-Title I schools. The LEA also used school year 1973-74teacher assignment schedules rather than the actual October 1, 1974 workassignment schedules in preparing its 1974-75 comparability report. Thisresulted in an inaccurate report to the SEA in violation of 45 CFR 116.26(b)(7)(1973), which specified that the data required must be of a date as specifiedby the Commissioner. The date specified by the Commissioner for 1974-75was October 1, 1974. <ITAG tagnum="84">B. Authority for Awarding a Grantback </ITAG>Section 456(a) of GEPA, 20 U.S.C. 1234e(a), provides that whenever theSecretary has recovered funds following a final audit determination withrespect to an applicable program, the Secretary may consider those fundsto be additional funds available for the program and may arrange to repayto the SEA or LEA affected by that determination an amount not to exceed75 percent of the recovered funds. The Secretary may enter into this ``grantback''arrangement if the Secretary determines that the_ (1) Practices and procedures of the SEA or LEA that resulted in the auditdetermination have been corrected, and the SEA or LEA is, in all otherrespects, in compliance with the requirements of the applicable program;(2) SEA has submitted to the Secretary a plan for the use of the fundsto be awarded under the grantbank arrangement that meets the requirementsof the program, and, to the extent possible, benefits the population thatwas affected by the failure to comply or by the misexpenditures that resultedin the audit exception; and (3) Use of funds to be awarded under the grantback arrangement in accordancewith the SEA's plan would serve to achieve the purposes of the programunder which the funds were originally granted. <ITAG tagnum="84">C. Plan for Use of Funds Awarded Under a Grantback Arrangement</ITAG>Pursuant to section 456(a)(2) of GEPA, the SEA has applied for a grantbackof $1,102,125 and has submitted a plan on behalf of the LEA for use ofthe grantback funds to meet the special educational needs of educationallydeprived children in programs administered under Chapter 1 of Title I ofthe Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended (Chapter1). According to the plan, the LEA would use the grantback funds to providea tutorial program to supplement the Chapter 1 program funded from theregular Chapter 1 entitlement for school years 1988-89 and 1989-90. Theregular Chapter 1 program provides for in-class and resource teacher supportin reading, writing, language, and mathematics. The tutorial program wouldprovide additional reinforcement in these programs. Approximately 500 eligibleChapter 1 children in grades 1-12 would benefit each year. The grantbackfunds would be used for salaries for a program facilitator, teachers, paraprofessionals,student aides, and parent advocates and for minimal supplies. On a voluntarybasis Chapter 1 participants would receive individualized and computer-assistedinstruction at 20 Chapter 1 sites for eight hours a week before and afterschool or on Saturdays. Biliterate/bilingual parent advocates would contactparents of middle and high school Chapter 1 students in writing and byphone to make them aware of the tutorial program and to encourage themto have their children participate. The parent advocates would also monitorattendance for these students throughout the year. Eligible children attendingnonpublic schools would be provided an equitable opportunity to participatein the tutorial program.<ITAG tagnum="84">D.
