Gold closed near its high for the week, prompting predictions byanalysts that it will test the psychologically important$400-an-ounce level next week.   On other commodity markets, copper sank to four-month lows;energy futures rose; livestock and meat futures were mixed; andgrains and soybeans were mixed.   Gold futures settled $3.10 to $3.90 higher on New York'sCommodity Exchange with the contract for delivery in December at$395.80 a troy ounce; silver futures finished 8.7 cents to 9.6cents higher on the Commodity Exchange with December at $5.685 atroy ounce.   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum futures settled$5.20 to $6 higher with January at $526.60 a troy ounce; palladiumended $3.25 to $4 higher with December at $145.60 a troy ounce.   The latest gains fit with a bullish trend in precious metalsprices that began last month and which analysts have attributedlargely to buying by investors fleeing the turbulent stock market.   The rally, which began on the London market before the New Yorkmarkets opened, defied expectations for a drop in prices followingThursday's weak finish.   ``What impressed me is that the market wasn't taken lowerabroad,'' said analyst Craig Sloane of Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp;Co. ``I felt everything followed from that.''   The palladium market led a late surge in the metals marketsfollowing news that a gas pipeline feeding a major Soviet nickelrefinery had exploded.   The Soviet Union is the world's largest producer of palladium, awhite metal similar to platinum that is a by-product of nickelrefining.   Copper futures fell sharply on the Commodities Exchange,continuing a downward trend linked to an improving supply outlook.Traders expect the London Metal Exchange's weekly stocks report onMonday to show an increase in the exchange's warehouse stocks ofcopper.   Copper futures finished 2.5 cents to 4.6 cents lower withDecember at $1.089 a pound, the lowest daily settlement price sinceJuly 21.   Energy futures rose on the New York Merc, led by strong gains inthe gasoline and heating oil markets.   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 5 cents to 7 centshigher with December at $19.91 a barrel; heating oil was .46 centto .60 cent higher with December at 59.27 cents a gallon; unleadedgasoline was .05 cent to .67 cent higher with December at 51.95cents a gallon.   Cattle futures were narrowly mixed on the Chicago MercantileExchange ahead of a monthly Agriculture Department report thatshowed 3 percent fewer cattle on feedlots Nov. 1 than on the samedate a year ago.   That number was near market expectations but the report alsoshowed an unexpectedly large number of feedlot placements lastmonth, which was expected to prompt fairly heavy selling of livecattle futures when trading resumes Monday.   Live cattle settled .07 cent lower to .20 cent higher withDecember at 74.87 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent lowerto .10 cent higher with November at 83.15 cents a pound; hogfutures were .30 cent to .95 cent higher with December at 49.97cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .20 cent to .65 cent higherwith February at 64.17 cents a pound.   Grain and soybean futures prices finished mixed on the ChicagoBoard of Trade after a dull trading session.
