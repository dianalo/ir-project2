Her desk is littered with pictures and figurines, all of a pipe-smoking man in a deerstalker hat. His image is plastered all over the walls, too, which seems a little odd. This, after all, is the London headquarters of the Abbey National Building Society, a big British savings and loan. What are we to deduce?    Actually, it's pretty elementary. The big, modern Abbey National building occupies a hefty chunk of Baker Street, including number 221B. That, as any detective buff knows, once consisted of &quot;a couple of comfortable bedrooms and a large airy sitting-room, cheerfully furnished and illuminated by two broad windows.&quot; It was the residence of Sherlock Holmes. And based on the volume of mail he gets, a lot of people think he's still billeted here.    More than 2,000 letters pour in each year, says Ms. Brown, 32, who for the past four years has acted as Holmes's secretary, a task she tackles one afternoon a week, taking a break from her job as the company's publications editor. They come from all over the world, with all sorts of requests. Some want autographs and pictures (&quot;I promise to send photographs of my brothers and sisters in return,&quot; writes a Gold Coast fan). Many extend invitations for parties, classroom visits, even weddings. Some request the services of a good detective, usually to track down a missing bicycle or cat.    Then there are the topical letters, the American who wants Holmes to investigate the arms deal with Iran (&quot;only you can get to the bottom of this&quot;) and those who cluck disapprovingly over the detective's cocaine habit (&quot;I must bring to your attention the harm you are doing to our children&quot;). Holmes gets a lot of nut mail, too. But Ms. Brown answers everything, politely explaining that Holmes can't respond himself as he has retired to the country, where he keeps bees.    The volume of mail has jumped during the last week or so because, as any Holmes connoisseur knows, this is a banner year. Exactly a century ago Sherlock Holmes made his print debut in &quot;A Study in Scarlet,&quot; a spirited adventure yarn by Arthur Conan Doyle, a young doctor who turned to fiction when his patients failed to show up. The saga went to three publishers before it was purchased for 25 pounds and appeared in Beeton's Christmas Annual of 1887. A huge success, it soon was published on its own, with a collection of rather eccentric illustrations by the writer's father (he gave Holmes a beard).    The author went on to pen a total of 60 Sherlock sagas -- and win a knighthood for them. Yet he was never overly fond of his know-it-all sleuth. He even killed him off in a tussle with Professor Moriarty, that arch-villain, at Switzerland's Reichenbach Falls. The public, of course, felt otherwise. It demanded Sherlock's return, and Sir Arthur, mindful of his bank account, brought him back to life. His tales, published in countless languages, have never gone out of print. And even in an era of pop stars, extra-terrestrials and the goriest detective exploits imaginable, the cozy, Victorian sagas of Sherlock Holmes are as seductive as ever. &quot;They're the best, aren't they,&quot; declares Capt. William Michell, secretary of the Sherlock Holmes Society of London.    Purists claim that the centenary was actually in 1954, the anniversary of the detective's birth. (The date is believed to be Jan. 6, deduced from the fact that Holmes, who often cited Shakespeare, quotes from &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; twice.) But that hasn't halted a rash of celebrations in dozens of countries, from Switzerland, site of Reichenbach Falls and the Sherlock Holmes Museum at the Chateau de Lucens, to Japan. &quot;We have booms,&quot; observes a fan. &quot;First it was Princess Diana, now it is Sherlock Holmes.&quot;    American Holmesians can look forward to a Southern California convention in March; a workshop at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Va., in July; and a week-long symposium at Stanford University in Palo Alto, Calif., in August. For the less academically inclined, there's a gourmet dinner in May at the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, N.Y.; all edibles will relate to &quot;A Study in Scarlet.&quot; And the Baker Street Irregulars, those New York stalwarts who have kept the faith since 1934, supped at a special banquet on the 9th.    Here in London, festivities are also under way in typical English fashion -- understated and clubby. The big deal was the big dinner on the 6th for 180 members of the Sherlock Holmes Society of London, held in the members' dining room of the House of Commons. It was a glamorous black-tie affair, says Stanley MacKenzie, a charter member of the 36-year-old organization and owner of one of the finest Holmesiana collections around. And the menu, garnished with quotes from &quot;A Study in Scarlet,&quot; was a great success. The entree consisted of spring chicken with button onions, bacon, mushrooms and wine sauce (&quot;A clean breast of the facts&quot;), and for dessert, chocolate profiteroles (&quot;I have no time for trifles&quot;).    Members of the London group will also travel to Reichenbach Falls in May, where they'll don Victorian garb and reenact the historic confrontation between Holmes and Moriarty.    But non-members can always view the collection by appointment at St. Marleybone Public Library, or down a drink at the Sherlock Holmes Pub. Or they can make a fond pilgrimage to the Charing Cross Hotel, where, as readers of &quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot; know, it all began.    ---   Ms. Trucco is a London-based free-lance writer. </TEXT></DOC>
