He got it _ more than 30,000 words ofdetails and rhetoric about ``leadership to direct the forces ofchange ... guided by American values.''   After a full week of deliberations, the platform committee onFriday fitted the last planks in place in the conservative documentthat lays out the Bush agenda for the future.   ``We're a conservative political party,'' said Republican Partychief Frank J. Fahrenkopf. ``We're proud of that. We're not afraidof the `c' word.''   If the conservatives were happy with the final form readied forthe convention next week, the party's moderates said they were notrunning away.   ``We feel this is a progressive platform,'' said Gov. JohnMcKernan of Maine.   ``There are some things in this platform I do not like,'' saidRep. Jan Meyers of Kansas, but ``conservatives and moderates in theRepublican Party can run on it and not from it.''   And there were no reports of anyone so unhappy with the platformas to be drafting a minority report to spark a floor fight nextweek.   But Democrats, who produced a 5,000-word thematic document attheir convention in Atlanta last month, were quick to ridicule theGOP platform.   ``The GOP has cooked up a platform that is a version of 1980 and1984 warmed-over broken promises,'' said Democratic Party chiefPaul Kirk. ``Once again, the Republicans are talking about thefuture through a rear-view mirror.''   ``They're doing everything they can to avoid talking about theircandidate and leadership,'' said Leslie Dach, communicationsdirector for Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis,adding the document was ``a right-wing platform proudly mired inthe past.''   The long and often tedious platform work ended on a high note ascommittee chairman Kay Orr, the Nebraska governor, unveiled herpreamble that opens the document.   ``An election is about the future, about change,'' she read.``The election will bring change. The question is: Will it bechange and progress with the Republicans or change and chaos withthe Democrats?''   ``Americans want leadership to direct the forces of change ...guided by American values,'' she went on.   Then she choked up briefly as she read the final sentences:   ``At the very heart of this platform is our belief that thestrength of America is its people. ... They are still eager tograsp the future, to seize the chaos of experience and throughfaith and love and work, to transfer it into the valuable, theuseful and the beautiful.   ``This is what the American people do, quietly, patiently,without headlines, as a nation of communities every day. ... It isto them we dedicate this platform.''   The 106-member committee ended work Friday and a final draft ofthe document will be released late today. The final committee votecomes Monday afternoon in preparation for the convention floordiscussion Tuesday.   Friday's work was concentrated on foreign policy and defense,areas where Bush believes he has an advantage over Dukakis.   There were some squabbles, but most disputes were settledquietly such as the question of how quickly to deploy the StrategicDefense Initiative.   Language calling for ``rapid and certain deployment'' of theStar Wars missile defense system prevailed, authored byconservatives led by Angela ``Bay'' Buchanan of California. TheBush campaign simply said the language was fine, though it wasslightly firmer than the call for deployment as soon as feasiblethat the campaign had favored.   ``We were thrilled with the original language and we're happywith where we are,'' said New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu, a Bushrepresentative on the committee. ``You're arguing over nuances.''   The Bush campaign also added at the last minute a summarychapter on defense and foreign policy, saying it grew out of ameeting three weeks ago with Bush.   ``It's a Bush national security strategy document,'' saidCharlie Black, the campaign's chief staffer on platform matters.   The original draft of the new chapter included no mention ofSDI, but it was added in a hurriedly called subcommittee meetingFriday afternoon.   Black and former Sen. John Tower of Texas both denied anysignificance to the omission.   Despite the platform's conservative tone, it was not strongenough on foreign policy for some of the committee members.   ``The Russian bear hasn't changed _ they've just dressed him upin a three-piece suit and Gucci loafers,'' said Jim Summers ofWashington.   The committee agreed to a strong statement denouncing SouthAfrica's racial policies: ``Republicans deplore the apartheidsystem of South Africa and consider it morally repugnant.''   Then a struggle erupted between the Bush campaign and moremilitant committee members over how to describe the source of thetroubles in that region of the world. The platform already blamed``Marxist imperialism which actively supports the march of tyrannyin Africa.''   Bush forces, firmly in control, wanted no variations incarefully crafted language and turned back all major changes.</TEXT></DOC>
