Ding Shisun was the second university president replaced sincethe protests, and more replacements were anticipated as the rulingCommunist Party moves to prevent renewed campus unrest.   The official Xinhua News Agency portrayed the move asnon-political and said the 62-year-old Ding had asked as early asFebruary to leave for ``health and other reasons.'' It said he hadbeen given a four-year term when appointed in 1984.   However, school officials within the past month said repeatedlythat Ding had no plans to leave. When contacted by telephone asrecently as Monday, they said Ding remained president and made nomention of a planned change.   Ding was replaced by 56-year-old Wu Shuqing. Wu had been vicepresident of People's University, whose students also took part inthe protests. Xinhua said He Dongchang, vice minister of theEducation Commission, appointed Wu at a ceremony Wednesday.   He urged the school to keep a socialist outlook and trainstudents to be both ``red and expert'' in their fields.   Students from Beijing University, considered China's mostprestigious school, took the lead in the spring protests as theyhave in past political movements.   After the April 15 death of ousted party leader Hu Yaobang,hundreds of posters were put up on the Beijing University campusmourning him and subtly criticizing the government.   Ding maintained a low profile during the protests, speaking outonly to urge a speedy solution to the problem. But he also didnothing to stop his students, while other schools pressured studentsto stop protesting and some even locked campus gates before marches.   The government has ordered concentrated political study forteachers and students at all universities. Special measures havebeen taken to keep Beijing University under control.   Its freshman class has been cut from the planned 2,100 studentsto 600, and the students have been ordered to take a year ofmilitary training before beginning degree work. Six social sciencedepartments, including history, philosophy and sociology, are notbeing allowed to admit any new students, sources have said.   Other colleges are starting classes this month to make up fortime lost in the spring, but Beijing University has been ordered todelay reopening until Oct. 14. The measure was apparently to ensureits students do nothing to disrupt the Oct. 1 celebration of the40th anniversary of Communist rule.   The nation's total college freshman class has been cut by 30,000students, to 610,000.   In late June, authorities in Shenzhen, a special export zone nearHong Kong, fired the president of Shenzhen University for supportingthe democracy movement. The central province of Anhui fired thedeputy director of its education commission, also for allegedlyencouraging the protests.   Other academics have been criticized harshly and some have beenjailed.   Also Wednesday, a leading member of the Chinese-Americancommunity, Anna Chennault, met with Chinese Vice President Wang Zhenbut refused to disclose what they discussed.   She said upon returning to the United States she would report toPresident Bush.   Mrs. Chennault is the widow of Gen. Claire Lee Chennault, whofounded the World War II ``Flying Tiger'' force that backed theNationalist Chinese in their fight against Japan.</TEXT></DOC>
