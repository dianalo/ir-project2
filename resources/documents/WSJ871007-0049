Terms weren't disclosed.    Thurston, a less-than-truckload general freight carrier based in Charlotte, N.C., had 1986 revenue of $143.7 million.    IU, which has interests in distribution, environmental and transportation services, said the loss on the sale &quot;will have a significant negative impact&quot; on third-quarter results. But it said that because Thurston's losses will be reported as discontinued operations for 1987, it expects an increase in its profit from continuing operations. IU wouldn't estimate results for the quarter, but for the year-earlier period, it posted net income of $9.2 million, or 33 cents a share, on revenue of $375.1 million.    Brown Transport said Thurston's operations will be merged into its own. </TEXT></DOC>
