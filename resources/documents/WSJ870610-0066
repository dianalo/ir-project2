Terms weren't disclosed.    Mead, a paper-products and information-retrieval concern, expects the sale to result in a nonrecurring third-quarter after-tax gain of 24 cents a share.    In the year-earlier period, Mead reported net income of $23.1 million, or 74 cents a share, on sales of $837.4 million.    Weyerhaeuser, a Tacoma, Wash., forest-products concern, had sales of about $5.5 billion last year.    In February, Mead said it intended to sell the six plants -- situated in Albert Lea, Minn.; Amarillo, Texas; St. Joseph, Mo.; Waterloo, Iowa; Butner, N.C., and Memphis, Tenn. -- in connection with a restructuring plan.    Mead expects to close the sale, contingent on clearance by federal regulators, in three to six weeks. </TEXT></DOC>
