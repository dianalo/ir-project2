(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Empty Bullfrog County, created fromscrubland in a bid to assure the state of federal dollars shouldthe government build a nuclear dump in Nevada, violates the stateconstitution, a judge has ruled.   Judge David Zenoff said Thursday the county stretched its legallimits ``every which way,'' and left too many constitutional issues``hanging in the air.''   Nye County, from which unpopulated Bullfrog County was carved,had challenged the 1987 Legislature's creation of the state's 18thcounty.   Zenoff, a former state Supreme Court justice brought in to hearthe case, issued the ruling after less than 30 minutes of oralarguments in district court.   Zenoff said the governor's authority to appoint threecommissioners for the county ran ``contrary to the democraticprocess,'' and contributed to its failure to provide representativegovernment.   ``I cannot in good conscience uphold this law,'' he said.   ``Obviously, we're very pleased,'' said Nye County DistrictAttorney Phil Dunleavy. ``It confirms what we've been saying allalong. As far as I'm concerned, Bullfrog County is dead and itshould be.''   Attorney Frank Daykin, representing the Legislature and BullfrogCounty, said it would be up to the Legislative Commission to decidewhether to appeal Zenoff's ruling to the state Supreme Court.   The commission's next meeting is scheduled for Wednesday.   ``We usually don't accept defeat in the Legislature,'' saidcommission Chairman Lawrence Jacobsen.   Legislators created the county out of a 144-square-mile chunk ofNye County as a way of giving the state control over federal fundsavailable for the proposed. Yucca Mountain in southern Nevada isone of three sites under consideration.   Had Bullfrog County been selected, the U.S. government wouldhave had to compensate the state-run county an estimated $8 millionto $25 million a year, officials said.   ``Personally, I hope the Legislature doesn't appeal it becauseit's brought enough embarrassment to Nevada and should be allowedto lay in peace,'' Dunleavy said. ``The Legislature needs torethink its approach to the problem.''   Nye County stands to lose revenue should the new county remainon the books.   Gov. Richard Bryan, who signed the law creating the county intoeffect, issued only a brief statement upon learning of Zenoff'sdecision.   ``This apparently resolves the Bullfrog County issue unless theLegislature chooses to appeal,'' he said.   Karen Zupon, the governor's press secretary, said Bryan ``hasalways said he'll abide by the court's decision. He's not a partyto the suit and he hasn't said anything about whether he thinks itshould be appealed.''   Nye County challenged the county's creation on 37 differentlegal grounds in a 92-page brief. Its major complaint was BullfrogCounty's failure to provide representative government.   Zenoff agreed, saying it was not ``answerable to the people.''Among other things, he said the law made no provisions for ajudicial district or legislative representation for the county.</TEXT></DOC>
