The joint venture, calledComstar, got the right to provide international and localtelephone service all over the Soviet Union. Both sides hopedto ease the nation's severe communications problems.   But after two years of operation, Comstar has barely madea dent.</LP><TEXT>   The joint venture is profitable, largely because of alucrative international pay telephone business. But overall,Comstar has been severely limited; it sells only to therelatively small population that can pay in hard currency.And the company sometimes gets so tangled by Soviet red tapethat it is unable to serve customers.   Alexander Krupnoff, director of the telphone ministry'smain communication department, dismisses Comstar asinsignificant. &quot;It is a small venture that renders paidservices to our guests,&quot; he says. In general, he adds, &quot;Wedon't think the partnership with the West is a success.&quot;   Comstar says it doesn't plan to leave, despite thepolitical and economic instability. &quot;We're here for the longhaul,&quot; says Peter Brown, the British deputy chairman ofComstar.   Ventures with foreign companies represent the only realchance for the Soviet Union to succeed in the near future.And despite the disappointment with Western partnerships andthe xenophobia that is making a comeback in Mr. Gorbachev'snew, conservative government, the economic pressures thatforced him to look to the West for help six years ago arestill valid.   Soviet officials are adamant about the need for continuedcooperation. &quot;Comstar will never tell the West to go home,&quot;says the joint venture's Soviet general director, IgorLobovsky. &quot;It would be a fatal step for the future of thiscountry.&quot;   Says Igor Shurchkov, technical director of the Ministry ofCommunication, &quot;If there is no help from the West, it willtake us a much longer time to improve.&quot;   If anything ever needed fixing in the Soviet Union, it'sthe telephone system. There are only 40 million lines for 100million families. The exchanges, some of them 60 years old,dial wrong numbers, cross lines and drown out conversationswith static. Callers from abroad get constant busy signals,because a hard-currency shortage limits the number ofoverseas circuits. Residential telephone books don't exist.   The absence of multiple-line telephones, common in theWest, leaves a clutter of telephones on the desks ofimportant people. Even switchboards are rare.   For those without phones, the shortage of telephonecircuits means years of waiting to be hooked up. And evenwith the lack of lines, telephone-set production can't keepup with demand. Satellite systems and fiber optic cables,which would greatly expand the number of phone links, can'tbe produced until military telecommunications-gear factoriesconvert over to make them, and Moscow doesn't have the hardcash to import them.   The cost will be huge. The telephone ministry estimatesthat just to make the cable for the needed 60 million newlines will cost 70 billion rubles ($42 billion at thecommercial exchange rate). Despite 20 joint-venturepartnerships set up in the past three years between differentcommunications ministries and Western companies, the Westerninvestment has been too small to lead to the kinds ofproduction projects the Soviets would like.   Comstar won't discuss the size of its investment or itsplans. But it clearly won't be supplying the whole nationwith telephone cable, because it doesn't want to earnunconvertible rubles. About 60% of its business comes fromthe 28,000 Soviet enterprises that earn hard currency bytrading with the West; the rest from about 700 foreignembassies and businesses.   Even Soviet enterprises that can pay hard currency don'tnecessarily want to part with it. Accustomed to bad telephoneservice, businesses often aren't willing to pay Comstar'shigh prices for better service. A new tax law that requiresall Soviet enterprises trading with the West to turn over 40%of their hard-currency earnings to central coffers makestheir available cash even more precious.   The tough nature of the job has already cost Comstar twomarketing executives who returned to England. Comstar'smanager, Mr. Lobovsky, says the executives made too manyplans on paper. &quot;You have to work with your legs here, notyour brain,&quot; he says.   GEC says it would spend more and do more but is blockedevery step of the way by the Soviet bureaucracy. &quot;We getfilibustered at every turn. There's always a reason not to doit,&quot; says one executive, who doesn't want to be named. (GECPlessey itself is a joint venture between Plessey Co. andGeneral Electric Co. of Britain, no relation to the U.S.General Electric Co.)   In one case, the Soviet office that supervises the foreignbusiness and diplomatic community for several months wouldn'tpermit Comstar to enter the foreigners' compounds to installthe lines. Hewlett Packard Co., after waiting three years forthe telephone ministry to install additional computer linesat its Moscow office, finally turned to Comstar.   But when Comstar workers arrived to install them,representatives from the diplomatic administration insistedwithout explanation that the drilling be stopped. After threemonths of letters and telephone calls, the officials agreedto permit the installation only if Hewlett-Packard paid$1,000 to the agency to repair the holes that Comstar haddrilled.   To be sure, doing business with the West isn't easy forComstar's Soviet partner either. Mr. Lobovsky says Westernsuppliers often fail to deliver equipment on time, or havetried to palm off cheap telephone sets or outdated faxmachines. For months, Comstar has been able to offer onlylarge telephone sets that handle 10 lines and 32 extensions.The smaller variety used by medium-size offices hasn't beenobtainable.   &quot;We idealized the West all our life concerning businessand believed you were perfect,&quot; says Mr. Lobovsky. &quot;It wasvery unexpected to discover such things.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
