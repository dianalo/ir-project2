 Both areas have become hot as user corporationsseek to make internal work teams as well as external interactions withcustomers and suppliers more efficient and effective.andM;Both EDI and document management have been marketed in eitherapplication-specific forms or as specialized--high cost--systems.andP;  DigitalEquipment's strategy is to make EDI and document management servicesavailable as part of the VAX/VMS and RISC/Ultrix platform software, andavailable to applications across those two platforms.andP;  Implementation of thestrategy will come first on VAX/VMS, as is customary in Digital's NetworkApplications Support (NAS).andM;Although Digital announced the new EDI and document management services onthe same day, the two are managed by different groups within the company.andO;They are different in structure and even in their states of readiness formarket.andP;  The new EDI Services component of NAS is a completely definedproduct line, due in September.andP;  The Document Management Program, incontrast, leaves more details open for later clarification.andP;  In fact, most ofthe program is nothing new at all.andP;  In this article, we consider the DocumentManagement Program first.andM;DOCUMENT MANAGEMENT PROGRAM.andP;  Digital's strategic goal is to make documentmanagement a set of generic services available and affordable to a widevariety of applictions.andP;  The Document Management Program is a set ofapplications that use two key NAS services--Compound Document Architecture(CDA) and Application Control Services (ACS).andP;  Documents under management maybe compound, or mixed media, documents.andM;It is interesting to note that most of the products included in the documentmanagement announcements are not native Digital products.andM;The news contained in the Document Management Program concerned several newpartners and innovations in existing partnerships.andP;  Digital announcedrelationships with GEScan International, developer of a system that filtersincoming data feeds like newswires, and Excalibur Incorporated, developer ofthe PixTex and Savvy image-indexing and -retrieval system.andM;For the most part, though, the announcement was a positioning statement.andO;Digital laid out the services it intends to support within an overallprogram.andP;  The components are: the Workflow Manager, content-based retrievers,knowledge linkers, and structured document libraries.andM;Workflow Manager.andP;  The Workflow Manager is Odesta's Document ManagementSystem (ODMS), which Digital had previously endorsed as part of itselectronic publishing strategy.andP;  Odesta has plans to port ODMS to the rangeof client workstations supported by Digital within NAS, and it supportsDigital's Rdb as a back-end database.andM;Digital positions ODMS as its workflow management system, providing theability to describe the roles of workgroup members, the components ofworkgroups, and the schedule of due dates.andP;  Digital's announcement focused onthe following six capabilities:andM;* Routing of documents from one person to another personandM;* Capturing comments by reviewersandM;* Electronic signoff/approval by each reviewerandM;* Notification of team members of any changes in the document(s)andM;* Configuration of document structureandM;* Process/workflow descriptionandM;These are six of the things that ODMS does, but not all of what it does.andO;ODMS could, in fact, function not only as a &quot;workflow manager&quot; but also as astructured document library.andP;  Digital has niched ODMS in an artificial way asit promotes its Electronic Document Control System II, the next component inthe Document Management Program.andM;Structured Document Libraries.andP;  The structured document library component ofthe Document Management Program is Digital's Electronic Document ControlSystem (EDCS) II.andP;  EDCS II is a storage manager that can preservehierarchical structures that unite documents into a unified context.andP;  In asense, EDCS II supports hyperlinks between documents, but maps of links mustbe hierarchically structured.andP;  This capability is useful when dependenciesbetween the elements of documents are strong; e.g., the order in which thechapters of a book appear is important.andM;Digital's engineering and technical systems group developed EDCS II to manageengineering documents.andP;  By placing it in the Document Management Program,Digital is seeking wider application of the technology.andP;  The product canstore large pieces of information and multiple types of information, whichmakes it attractive in multimedia applications.andM;EDCS II is available on VMS servers, and an Ultrix version is planned.andM;There's a lot of overlap between ODMS and EDCS II.andP;  Digital positions themaccording to their &quot;design centers.&quot;andP;  ODMS is designed primarily to designworkflows involving documents, not as a storage library; EDCS II plays thatrole.andP;  This distinction, in fact, is artificial.andP;  ODMS can play both roles.andO;And we won't be surprised when it takes on a much wider role in Digitalshops--and in Digital's strategy.andM;Contend-Based Retrievers.andP;  Content-based retrieval software allows users tofind documents according to the words and concepts they contain.andP;  Thissoftware routes documents to users, recognizing priorities in the process.andM;This component of Digital's Document Management Program is strong because itcovers three dimensions of the content-based retrieval problem: textdatabases, information-filtering, and image.andP;  Digital is working with threevendors with distinct strengths.andM;BasisPlus.andP;  BasisPlus from Information Dimensions Incorporated is a dedicateddatabase for storing and retrieving large documents.andP;  It is already widelyused by Digital customers with applications requiring large text databases.andM;BasisPlus automatically indexes and archives information, and it is availableon both VMS and Ultrix servers.andP;  MS Windows, DECwindows, and terminal clientsare supported.andP;  Inclusion in the Document Management Program signals thatadditional clients will be forthcoming.andM;GEScan.andP;  GEScan from GEScan International is a real-time filtering system.andO;It searches live information streams for content that matches user profiles,and then delivers the filtered information to desktops.andP;  GEScan isappropriate for applications involving live information feeds from electronicnews or financial information services.andM;GEScan runs on VMS servers.andP;  Ultrix servers and support for a variety ofclients will be forthcoming later.andM;PixTex and Savvy/TRS.andP;  PixTex and Savvy/TRS, from Excalibur Incorporated,index and search the content contained in &quot;image-intensive&quot; documents.andP;  Theyare appropriate for applications involving documents stored as images.andM;Both PixTex and Savvy/TRS run on VMS servers; expect to see Ultrix versionsand support for a variety of clients in the near future.andM;Knowledge Linkers.andP;  Knowledge linkers is Digital's term for hyperlinkingapplications.andP;  Through CDA, Digital already allows users to link disparateelements and represent them in a single document-oriented image.andP;  Knowledgelinkers apply the same concept to multiple documents and elements across thenetwork.andP;  They allow users to link elements such as a personal calendar,meeting notes, various mail messages, and source documents, and store thelinks for distribution, storage, or retrieval.andP;  The user doesn't actuallyview a compound document, but can see a map of the links between elements.andM;Digital has demonstrated this technology, and is promising a product within12 months.andP;  That product will be a service available across a network, notjust an application.andM;HOW INTEGRATED IS THIS STUFF?andP;  The elements in the Document ManagementProgram all use NAS services to one extent or another.andP;  Here's how:andM;* Support for DECwindows allows the user to get access to each documentmanagement element using a separate window on a display.andM;* Support for SQL Services gives each element access to Rdb.andP;  That, in turn,allows data to be handed off between elements within Rdb.andP;  For example, ODMSand EDCS II could exchange data through the medium of Rdb.andM;* Support for MAILbus allows all of the Document Management Programcomponents to use MAILbus as a transport.andM;Over time, we expect Digital to increase the degree of integration betweenthe elements in its Document Management Program.andP;  Even though Digitalprovides avenues for interaction between the elements in its program, theelements themselves are separate applications and services unifiedessentially only by the user interface.andP;  A deeper level of program-to-programintegration is desired.andM;VERITY: FUTURE NAS SERVICE.andP;  Gradually, we expect Digital to raise some (ifnot all) of the current services in the Document Management Program to thestatus of NAS services.andP;  NAS is the ultimate in functional integration forDigital.andP;  The first candidate for this treatment is content-based retrieval.andO;Digital will work with Verity Incorporated of Mountain View, California, tobuild this, and has licensed the content-retrieval technology at the heart ofVerity's Topic product.andP;  Verity's technology will become the basis for thenew NAS service.andM;DEC/EDI.andP;  DEC/EDI is an integrated application service--within the NASframework--making EDI available to NAS-compliant applications as a generalservice.andP;  With EDI, a document--purchase orders, invoices, ship notices,etc.--is converted into a structured format and treated as a singletransaction.andM;In DEC/EDI, Digital accommodates the layers of standards operating in the EDIworld.andP;  The first layer is support for the major transports used in movingelectronic traffic between corporations.andP;  DEC/EDI supports transfer of EDImessages over DECnet/OSI networks or MAILbus E-mail.andP;  In addition, Digital'sIBM SNA Gateway allows information to be moved from mainframes into theDEC/EDI framework.andM;The second layer is basic message-formatting for transport over X.400electronic mail networks.andP;  DEC/EDI builds in support for the two major EDImessage-format implementations within the X.400 electronic mail standard.andO;X.400 itself does not yet define a standard format for EDI traffic, althoughthe P-EDI standard is in the works.andP;  Until P-EDI arrives, the NationalInstitute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has defined a single way to useX.400's P-0 format specification to support EDI, and TEDIS, a European group,has defined a single spec based on X.400's P2 format.andP;  In DEC/EDI, Digitalsupports both the NIST and TEDIS implementer's agreements.andM;The third layer is the variety of EDI formats employed by differentcompanies, industries, and standards organizations for EDI documents.andO;Digital provides a Translation Service to mitigate the differences betweenformats now and over time.andM;DEC/EDI Structure.andP;  DEC/EDI software comprises three servers, which operateunder the NAS and DECmcc network management umbrella.andP;  The servers can be ona single VAX or be distributed across multiple VAXs.andM;Communications Server.andP;  The Communications Server is a gateway between thelocal network and external EDI networks.andP;  Through four separate optionalservices, the Communications Server supports several outside transports,including the X.400 services of ATandamp;T Mail and MCI Mail, the BSC services ofBT Tymnet, and GEIS.andP;  Interoperability tests with other services are underway, and we can expect more to be added in the near future.andM;DEC/EDI supports direct X.400 links between suppliers and customers.andP;  Theadvantage of a direct X.400 link is that EDI traffic can run alongside X.400mail traffic, which can simplify administration and management.andP;  Lastly, theOFTP option supports direct transport of EDI traffic on X.25 nets.andM;The Communications Server also includes a scheduling function.andP;  VAX MessageRouter (V.3.1 or later), VAX Message Router X.400 Gateway (2.0 or later), andVAX PSI Access and/or VAX PSI (4.2 or later) are required.andM;Translation Server.andP;  The Translation Server translates EDI data from acompany's internal format to an external EDI standard.andP;  The server notifiesthe system manager that data sent or received is in compliance with thestandard agreed to by trading partners.andP;  Users can also use the TranslationServer to develop specific message formats unique to specific tradingpartners.andM;The standards Digital supports in the first release of DEC/EDI are:andM;* EDIFACT, the dominant EDI standard in EuropeandM;* ANSI X12, the dominant core standard in the United States.andM;* TDCC, a transportation industry standardandM;* Odette and AIAG, the major automotive industry standardsandM;* CIDX and CEFIC, the major chemical industry standardsandM;* EIDX, the electrical industry standardandM;* WINS/UICS, the grocery/warehousing industry standardsandM;* EDIFICE, the electronics industry standardandM;Application Server.andP;  The Application Server provides tools and callableroutines for building the data-transfer and -routing capabilities to linkapplications and the Translation Server.andM;CONCLUSIONS.andP;  We're impressed with Digital's EDI offering.andP;  By making EDI aNAS service, Digital has positioned the technology to be much more attractiveto its customers than it is today.andP;  In announcing DEC/EDI, Digital revealedthat a variety of software vendors had agreed to use the product set to addEDI function to their packages.andP;  This is going to be attractive to usersbecause it allows them to migrate to EDI.andM;We're also impressed with the vision of Digital's Document ManagementProgram.andP;  The program demonstrates that Digital understands what's needed indocument management and groupware.andP;  It falls short in implementation,however.andP;  We expect to see more--another of Digital's vauntedarchitectures--on this subject in the near future as the company sorts outits internal development projects from its partnership products.andM;Digital's positioning of EDI and the full-text search capabilities ofDocument Management should help educate the market on the horizontalcommercial value of these technologies.andP;  Both EDI and Document Management areusually viewed as point or niche technologies.andP;  We disagree.andP;  The electronicexchange of information between organizations should not be limited tofinancial transactions typically slotted to EDI.andP;  Similarly, the managementof files and documents within a workgroup is not unique to technicalpublishing environments, the usual market for this type of system.andP;  We hopeDigital's renewed attention to these very useful technologies brings them outof their niches into the mainstream of enterprise computing.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
