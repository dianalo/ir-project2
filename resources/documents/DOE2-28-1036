Aspin. Conventionalarms control will be even more difficult than nuclear arms control. Someof the toughest problems in a conventional agreement would be: (1) Verification.How do we keep track of tens of thousands of tanks owned by the tensof countries that would be involved? (2) Levels of limits. How do weget from {similar_to} 50,000 Warsaw Pact and 20,000 NATO tanks down toan equal number low enough to help stability? The Soviets will have toagree to asymmetrical cuts. (3) Country limits. Within overall limits,how do we divide the remaining tanks among the signatory countries? (4)Geography. Over what geographic areas do the limits apply, and what dowe do with tanks outside those areas? 5. What to limit. Can we get awaywith just tanks, or will we have to limit the force structure that supportstanks too? These problems have no easy solutions. There is a high probabilitythat they will not be solved, at least for quite some time. So whilewe should pursue conventional arms control, we cannot count on it togive us stability. With our unilateral efforts alone, we will be ableto create a more stable military situation. And if these arms controlproblems prove soluble, then our unilateral force improvements, alongwith arms control, will indeed give us a solid platform for securityin Europe.</TEXT></DOC>
