It was the first reported rocket attack on theAfghan capital in nearly three weeks.   Western diplomats in embassies near the road leading to theairport said they heard eight rockets land. It was the firstreported rocket attack since Dec. 27 by Moslem guerrillas who haveadvanced in the hills ringing Kabul as Soviet troops pull out aheadof a Feb. 15 deadline.   The Interior Ministry of the Soviet-backed Afghan administrationsaid the rockets landed in the city's Qalyszman district, an area ofmainly mud houses.   Casualties included women and children, the ministry said withoutelaboration.   The guerrillas apparently suspended rocket attacks on Kabulduring the Soviet withdrawal, but have stepped up attacks on supplyconvoys into the capital.   On Sunday, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze ended athree-day visit to Afghanistan with a pledge to supply arms toPresident Najib after the withdrawal of the remaining 50,000 Soviettroops in Afghanistan.   Shevardnadze implied the withdrawal would go ahead as scheduled,saying the Soviet Union believes Najib's army can cope on its own.   In Islamabad, the Pakistan- and U.S.-backed guerrillas told aguerrilla news agency they have overrun two key government militaryposts in Afghanistan's border areas but allowed 200 food trucksthrough to the embattled capital.   Combined resistance sources said the military posts were capturedin the past week and put the guerrillas within three miles of thegovernment-held eastern city of Jalalabad, 42 miles from thePakistan border.   There was no independent confirmation of the guerrilla newsagency's report.   Insurgents captured six tanks and 3,000 weapons, the agencyclaimed. Other guerrilla sources claimed 600 Afghan army andmilitiamen surrendered.   Guerrillas also claimed they have stepped up attacks nearsoutheastern Kandahar city, the western city of Herat and innorthern provinces bordering the Soviet Union.   The guerrilla news agency said guerrillas allowed about 200 foodtrucks through to Kabul last week to relieve shortages ofcommodities and fuel. In Kabul, however, reports say guerrillasstill are attacking food convoys on a strategic highway. Fewsupplies are getting through.   Lines for fuel and foodstuffs start in the early morning inKabul, where prices are rising rapidly and power blackouts lastseveral hours each day.   The Soviets intervened in Afghanistan nearly in December 1979 toaid the Soviet-allied government. They later had more than 100,000troops in Afghanistan. About half the Soviet troops already haveleft under a U.N.-brokered Geneva accords.   Moscow has been insisting members of Kabul's current Marxistregime have a role in a postwar government, but the guerrillas saythey will not share power with former foes.   The insurgents say they are confident of a military victory andon Jan. 6 broke off direct talks with the Soviet Union onAfghanistan's political future.</TEXT></DOC>
