The new-generation motors, which are to go into use in the mid-1990s, face technical and economic obstacles, industry and government officials say. There are also questions about whether the rockets, if ever built, will represent that much more of an improvement over those Thiokol currently is building to correct flaws that led to the 1986 shuttle accident. The Thiokol motors will be used on shuttle missions interchangeably with the advanced versions after 1994.    The National Aeronautics and Space Administration already is facing a cut of as much as $1 billion to its proposed fiscal 1989 budget, and will have to decide if it wants to fund the advanced rocket motor program at the expense of other significant NASA programs, such as the U.S. space station. Officials familiar with Morton Thiokol said the Chicago-based aerospace, salt and chemical company decided against bidding for the advanced motor contract partly out of belief that funding for the program might never come through.    &quot;NASA's whole budget is in trouble . . . If the redesigned solid rocket motor proves safe, is upgrading (the motors) something that ought to be deferred?&quot; said a congressional staff member familiar with the agency's budget problems.    NASA could save between $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion by scrapping plans to build the advanced rocket and substituting Morton Thiokol rockets on the flights planned now for the advanced versions. NASA has said that amount is what it will take to build and equip a production facility, as well as design, develop and certify the new motors for flight. Each motor used thereafter will cost NASA an additional $15 million.    NASA says the advanced motors, as envisioned, will improve safety margins by reducing several potential causes for failure and will increase the payload capacity of each shuttle by about 12,000 pounds, to 65,000 pounds, making each launch more cost efficient.    But says one industry official partial to the Thiokol design: &quot;The gains you get from the advanced rocket motor are not 100% gains.&quot;    There is also some concern about whether contractors will be able to meet all of the specifications NASA has proposed for the advanced motor. For example, the various segments of the motor case currently are linked by joints that bolt them together. NASA has said it wants the motor case for the advanced rocket to be made of an alloy that will permit its various segments to be welded together.    That eliminates the alloy that Thiokol currently uses for the cases because it can't be welded. The company that eventually wins the contract to build the advanced motors will have to come up with a new mixture of metals that can meet NASA's specifications.    Despite doubts raised by others, officials at NASA say they will forge ahead with plans for the advanced version. &quot;I personally believe there is strong support in Congress for the advanced solid rocket motor and Morton Thiokol's decision won't change that,&quot; said J.R. Thompson, director of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center.    Five companies have said they plan to compete for the contract. They include: the team of Hercules Inc. and Atlantic Research Corp.; United Space Boosters Inc., a unit of United Technologies Corp.; and Aerojet-General Corp., a unit of GenCorp Inc., which is teamed with Lockheed Missiles andamp; Space Co., a unit of Lockheed Corp. </TEXT></DOC>
