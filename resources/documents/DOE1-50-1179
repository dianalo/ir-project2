The initialphase of this study was devoted to finding a suitable procedure for determiningthe total phosphorus content of organic soils. A number of differenttechniques were compared using marsh peat and EPA sludge. The secondphase of the study was devoted to determining the phosphorus uptake capabilitiesof various organic soils under batch laboratory conditions. An attemptwas made to identify soil components responsible for phosphorus uptakeby statistically correlating uptake with measurable properties that includedpH, ash content, native phosphorus, total iron and aluminum as well asextractable iron and aluminum. The third phase of the study was devotedto organic soil phosphorus uptake and retention under leaching conditions.This was accomplished by performing batch laboratory and column testsusing artifical wastewater spiked with inorganic phosphates.</TEXT></DOC>
