Although shares of companies that aim to make drugs through genetic engineering are up about 30% on average so far this year, the group is a mixed bag. Many of the stocks remain volatile and unpredictable, repeatedly confounding analysts and investors.    Many of the most visible biotechnology stocks, including Amgen, Cetus, Biogen, Chiron, Genetics Institute, Centocor and Xoma, are trading on the Nasdaq over-the-counter market. Another well-known biotechnology issue, Genentech, trades on the New York Stock Exchange.    One biotechnology portfolio manager advises investors buying the issues to prepare for some nasty short-term gyrations. &quot;I don't even like to talk about (the prospects for biotech stocks) over the next year or two,&quot; says Ken Oberman, portfolio manager of Oppenheimer Management's $3 million Global Bio-Tech Fund. &quot;The stocks will go up and down and some companies will do well while others won't. But the industry's future success is assured.&quot; Though the group overall has outperformed the market, Mr. Oberman says his fund has done &quot;terribly&quot; so far this year.    Some of the issues are mired in patent disputes and some are trying to live down past debacles, while others are working to overcome regulatory-approval setbacks. Such problems turn off many investors.    Analysts give high marks to some stocks in the group. They like Cetus and the outlook for regulatory approvals in the U.S. and abroad of its first proprietary pharmaceutical product, the Proleukin interleukin-2 anti-cancer drug. Chiron, which has developed a test to screen blood for hepatitis-C, is also popular. Another favorite, Xoma, is awaiting federal approval along with marketing partner Pfizer, to sell an antibody to treat septic shock.    Much of the stocks' gains occurred in the first quarter, analysts say. Since then, most of these issues haven't kept pace with the broader market. Andrew Offit, manager of Fidelity Select Biotechnology Portfolio, says one reason for the slower pace recently may be that the annual campaign to stir up interest in the group is still a few weeks away. Biotechnology companies usually meet with institutional investors and analysts at meetings sponsored by securities firms several times during the fall and winter, which usually results in a strong first-quarter performance, he says.    &quot;I don't want to imply that these are hype stocks,&quot; but they do seem to trade better around the time of industry conferences, Mr. Offit says.    Investor skepticism has been a factor, too. Amgen, for instance, is up 17% this year. But it has been jostled by investors trying to predict when the Thousand Oaks, Calif.-based concern would obtain regulatory approval of its highly touted anti-anemia compound, EPO. Analysts' first-year sales targets for the drug are in the $100 million range, but some think they could eventually top $1 billion annually.    The stock began the year at 33 3/4 and advanced to 44 1/4 by March. It fell back to around 40 during the next two months as the company encountered delays. When the company finally received the exclusive right to sell EPO in the U.S. for the next seven years, the stock caught fire and traded as high as 48.    But Amgen didn't sizzle for long. The stock soon retreated, as investors' attention turned to the company's long-awaited court battle with Genetics Institute over patent rights to EPO. Both companies are claiming that the other's patent for the compound is invalid. Friday, Amgen closed at 39 5/8, up 5/8. Genetics Institute, which is up a breathtaking 63% for the year, also added 5/8 to 27 1/4.    Jim McCamant, editor of the Medical Technology Stock Letter, believes that uncertainty about the outcome of the patent trial and its effects on both companies' fortunes is hurting the whole biotechnology group.    Currently, Amgen, Genetics Institute and Genentech are embroiled in patent litigation. Declares Mr. Offit of Fidelity: &quot;These patent issues are one of the frustrations of following the industry. No one knows what will happen.&quot;    Some of the skittishness stems from the headaches that one-time highflyer Genentech has had with its own blockbuster drug, TPA. Genentech, which sold as high as 47 in January 1988, is still depressed because the heart attack drug hasn't lived up to Wall Street's lofty expectations. The product is expected to have sales of $150 million to $200 million annually, about half the level analysts once expected. Genentech finished at 19 1/4, up 1/4 on Friday. It has improved 20% this year.    ---   Friday's Market Activity    The Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 2.01, or 0.4%, to 471.34. For the year, the composite is up roughly 24%. It rose 10% last week. By comparison, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.3% for the week and has added about 28% since Dec. 30, 1988.    Volume on the first trading day in September totaled only 113.5 million shares. But that's an improvement over last September's pace of 111.8 million shares a day. The daily average share turnover last month was 131 million.    Cellular communications stocks, which have been weak lately, rebounded. The surge by LIN, McCaw Cellular Communications and other cellular issues pushed the Nasdaq Utility Index up 9.63 to 745.92, a new high for the index. LIN jumped 2 1/2 to 108 1/2. McCaw surged 2 1/4 to 40. Cellular Communications rose 1 to 39 7/8, Contel Cellular rose 1 to 25 1/4, and U S West NewVector gained 1 to 44.    First Executive, the most active stock, jumped 1 to 13 1/2 on 2.8 million shares. Lyphomed advanced 1 3/8 to 31 3/8. The company agreed to be bought by Fujisawa Pharmaceutical of Japan for $31.87 a share.    Masstor Systems added 9/16 to 3 9/16 on 1.3 million shares. The company completed the private placement of 1.8 million preferred shares, raising a total of $4.2 million.    Beeba's Creations jumped 1 1/4 to 15 1/2 following speculation in a Business Week article that the distributor of women's sportswear may soon become a takeover target.    Nasdaq's biggest stocks have posted handsome gains this year. The Nasdaq 100 Index of non-financial stocks, which rose 3.02 to 447.03 on Friday and 1.2% last week, has advanced 26% this year. The Nasdaq Financial Index improved 1.36 to 468.28 on Friday and 1.1% for the week. It has risen 28% this year. </TEXT></DOC>
