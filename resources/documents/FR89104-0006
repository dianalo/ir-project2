The new AD requires repetitive inspections of main rotor bladeretention strap (strap pack) laminates for cracks and failures; the recordingof the locations of the observed cracks, fractures, or corrosion on straplaminates; and the removal of a hub assembly from service in accordancewith more stringent rejection criteria. The AD is prompted by reports offatigue cracks in a main rotor blade retention straps of the newer strappack design installed on MDHC Model 369 helicopters, which could resultin complete failure of a strap pack, separation of a main rotor blade fromthe main rotor hub, and consequent loss of control of the helicopter.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>February 2, 1989.The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulationsis approved by the Director of the <T4>Federal Register </T4>as of February 2, 1989.Compliance: As indicated in the body of this AD.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>The applicable service information notices may be obtainedfrom MDHC Technical Publications, Building 543/D214, McDonnell DouglasHelicopter Company, 5000 E.

The AD contains the more stringenthub rejection criteria defined in a recent MDHC Service Information Notice(SIN), and the applicability must be extended to other MDHC Model 369 helicopters,since the same -501 part number main rotor blade retention strap is usedon the Model 369E, F, and FF helicopters. The repetitive inspections ofmain rotor retention strap P/N 369D21210-501 are to be at intervals notto exceed 25 hours' time in service when two laminates have failed, ratherthan 100 hours' time in service as stated in AD 77-15-09R1.MDHC has issued revised SIN's DN-154 (Model 369D), EN-44 (Model 369E),and FN-33 (Models 369F and 369FF) which detail the inspection requirementsin Part I of the SIN. Part I also includes updated hub rejection criteriabased on location/number of laminate cracks/failures, and a new laminategap failure criterion. During an accident investigation on an MDHC Model369D helicopter, a previous entry in the log book indicated three cracksin the main rotor blade retention strap pack laminates. The postaccidentinvestigation revealed numerous laminate failures, but it was not possibleto determine whether the previously logged cracks were confined to thefailed strap pack or located among the four other blades. Therefore, theFAA is superseding AD 77-15-09, as amended by AD 77-15-09R, AD 77-19-04,as amended by AD 77-19-04R1, and Ad 81-10-08 with a new AD with requirementsto record locations of observed laminate cracks or fractures or corrosion;to record the number of failed laminates per single strap pack; to extendthe applicability to the Model 369E, F, and FF helicopters; to requirerepetitive inspections, at intervals not to exceed 25 hours' time in service,for all affected strap packs when certain laminate failure criteria aremet; and to remove rejected hubs from service on MDHC Model 369D, E, F,and FF helicopters.Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation,it is found that notice and public procedure hereon are impracticable andgood cause exists for making this amendment effective in less than 30 days.The regulations adopted herein would not have substantial direct effectson the states, on the relationship between the national government andthe states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficientfederalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.The FAA has determined preliminarily that this regulation is an emergencyregulation and that is not considered to be major under Executive Order12291. It is impracticable for the agency to follow the procedures of ExecutiveOrder 12291 with respect to this rule since the rule must be issued immediatelyto correct an unsafe condition in aircraft. It has been further determinedthat this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT RegulatoryPolicies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). If this actionis subsequently determined to involve a significant/major regulation, afinal regulatory evaluation or analysis, as appropriate, will be preparedand placed in the regulatory docket (otherwise, an evaluation or analysisis not required).
