An infinity of physicallyinequivalent choices for dynamics can be made to evaluate average propertiesof an equilibrated canonical ensemble. The availability of differentchoices may, we suggest, open the principal possibility of searchingfor a dynamics which will adequately mimic not only the equilibrium butalso the time-dependent properties of a particular physical system.</TEXT></DOC>
