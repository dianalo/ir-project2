Typically, the display effect in      such devices is achieved by changing the electrical potential of a display      electrode relative to a counter electrode in the device to cause a film or      a fluid filled cell on the display electrode to electrochemically change      color. Such electrochemical display devices are superior to either the      type of emitting diode or plasma display panels that preceded them in      development, because they require substantially less power to achieve the      display function. While liquid crystal display devices have been developed      with lower power requirements than those of light emitting diodes and      plasma display panels, they have other inherent disadvantages. For      example, the visual effect achievable from liquid crystals is severely      limited by the viewing angle, i.e. if viewed from an angle several degrees      away from an axes orthogonal to the plane of the display surface the      visibility of this display is significantly decreased. Also, liquid      crystal displays have essentially no residual memory function within the      liquid materials. </PAR><PAR>  In the earliest electrochemical display devices, a color change was      typically affected between a single dark color and a white or yellowish      color, but no other variations in color were achievable. The      electrochemical color change cells of the present invention have a wide      color variation. </PAR><PAR>  Electrochemical display devices are expected to have a bright future since      the color of indication is brilliant, necessary voltage and current are      small and there is no restriction on the observation angle. </PAR><PAR>  Applicants have discovered unique types of electrochemical compounds.      Applicants have synthesized an intramolecular charge transfer salt (which      is described herein below) having multiple oxidation states which also      shows a wide variation in color change and wide variation in the      ultraviolet absorption. Applicants have also discovered for the first time      intermolecular charge transfer salts (which is described herein below)      including as an acceptor, a constituent, having a carbonyl group      conjugated to an aromatic moiety. </PAR><PAR>  An intramolecular charge transfer salt is a covalent compound containing a      moiety having a negative charge and an unpaired electron (radical-anion)      and moiety having a positive charge and an unpaired electron      (radical-cation) on the same molecule. An intramolecular charge transfer      salt is schematically represented in FIG. 15. Covalent compound 220 has a      moiety 222 which has a negative charge and an unpaired electron 224.      Moiety 222 is the radical-anion. Covalent compound 220 has a moiety 226      which has a positive charge and an unpaired electron 228. Moiety 226 is      the radical-cation. The article in J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1983, 105, 4468-4469      to J. Becker et al. and the article in Chemistry Of Materials, 1989, 1,      412-420 to J. Becker et al. describe expected benefits of intramoleculer      charge transfer salts and reports some experimental data on a model      system. However, the articles of Becker et al. do not teach or suggest the      synthesis of an intramolecular charge transfer salt. </PAR><PAR>  In recent years there has been an extensive amount of work on      intermolecular charge transfer salts. This work is reviewed in the      following articles; NATURE Vol. 109 May, 1984, p. 119, entitled &quot;Organic      Metals&quot; to Bryce et al.; Accounts of Chemical Research, Vol. 12, No. 3,      March, 1979, J. B. Torrance; The Organic Solid State, Jul. 21, 1986, C andamp;      EN p. 28, D. O. Cowan et al. The most highly studied intermolecular charge      transfer salts are salts of TCNQ (tetracyano-p-quinodimethane), in      particular the intermolecular charge transfer salt of TCNQ with TTF      (tetrathiafulvalene). The TTF-TCNQ salt shows metallic-like conductivity.      The prior art, however, does not teach nor suggest an intermolecular      charge transfer salt including a compound having a carbonyl group      conjugated to an aromatic moiety as an electron acceptor constituent. As      used herein, an electrical conductor includes a material which is a      semiconductor and a metallic conductor. </PAR><PAR>  An intermolecular charge transfer salt is schematically represented in FIG.      16. Ionic compound 230 has anionic constituent 232 which has a negative      charge and an unpaired electron 234. Constituent 232 is the radical-anion.      Ionic compound 230 has cationic constituent 236 which has a positive      charge and an unpaired electron 238. Constituent 236 is the      radical-cation. Gap 240 schematically represents the absence of a covalent      link or bond between the radical-anion constituent 230 and the      radical-cation constituent in the ionic compound 230 and indicates the      ionic interaction between the radical-cation and radical-anion. </PAR><PAR>  It is an object of this invention to provide an electrochemical color      change cell containing an intramolecular charge transfer salt as a color      changing agent. </PAR><PAR>  It is another object of the present invention to provide an electrochemical      color change cell having as color change agent an intermolcular charge      transfer salt containing a constituent having a carbonyl group conjugated      to an aromatic moiety. </PAR><PAR>  It is another object of the present invention to provide an intermolecular      charge transfer salt compound. </PAR><PAR>  It is another object of the present invention to provide intramolecular      charge transfer compound containing a constituent having a carbonyl group      conjugated to an aromatic moiety. </PAR><PAR>  These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention      will be readily apparent to those of skill in the art from the following      more detailed description of the preferred embodiments and the figures      appended thereto. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  A broad aspect of the present invention is an electrochemical color change      cell having an intramolecular charge transfer salt as the color change      agent. </PAR><PAR>  Another broad aspect of the present invention is an intramolecular charge      transfer salt which is a covalent compound capable of having at least one      radical-cation moiety covalently bonded to at least one radical-anion      moiety. </PAR><PAR>  In a more particular aspect of the present invention, the intramolecular      charge transfer salt contains a violene or cyanine moiety and a moiety      containing a carbonyl group conjugated to an aromatic moiety. </PAR><PAR>  Another broad aspect of the present invention is an electrochemical color      change cell having an intermolecular charge transfer salt containing a      constituent having a carbonyl group conjugated to an aromatic moiety as an      anionic constituent as color change agent. </PAR><PAR>  Another broad aspect of the present invention is an intermolecular charge      transfer salt containing a constituent having a carbonyl group conjugated      to an aromatic moiety as an anionic constituent.

In the preferred      embodiment the gap between electrodes 6 and 8 was filled with an      electrochromic solution 4. However, electrochromic displays can be formed      with polymeric materials and solid materials as described in U.S. Pat. No.      4,571,029 to Skotheim et al. the teaching of which is incorporated herein      by reference and in U.S. Pat. No. 4,573,768 to Hirai, the teaching of      which is incorporate herein by reference. The electrodes 6 and 8 are      connected to a variable DC power source 10 to control the potential      between electrodes 6 and 8 and thereby the color of the electrochromic      cell of FIG. 1. Optionally the electrochromic cell can have a separator 12      between the indication electrode 6 and the counter electrode 8. The      separator can be separators commonly used in the art in electrolytic      cells, for example, a fritted glass plate (preferably having from 4-8      micron porosity), a salt bridge and a semipermeable membrane, for example,      a film of Nafion.RTM. DuPont. U.S. Pat. No. 4,183,631 to Kondo et al.      teaches an electrochromic display device using a separator. The teaching      of Kondo et al. is incorporated herein by reference. U.S. Pat. No.      4,141,876 to Arenallo et al. is an example of an electrochromic display      cell not using a separator. The electrochemical cell which is      schematically shown in FIG. 1 can be used in the electrochromic devices of      U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,864,589; 4,146,876; 4,008,950; 4,141,236 and 4,501,472      described herein below the teaching of each of which is incorporated      herein by reference. </PAR><PAR>  Electrochemical displays are known in which a plurality of separate      segments or display elements are individually energized to provide a      desired display characteristic. Such an arrangement is disclosed in U.S.      Pat. No. 4,008,950 to Chapman et al. The Chapman display contains      individually sealed cavities which contain an electrochemical fluid. Each      display element is individually controlled by a pair of electrodes in      contact with the fluid within each cavity. </PAR><PAR>  U.S. Pat. No. 3,864,589 to Schoot et al. describes an electrochemical      display device in which an elongated horizontally extending      electrochemical fluid cavity is provided for each of a plurality of      electrodes. A plurality of vertically oriented, horizontally spaced      individual display element cavities extend in communication with each      elongated fluid cavity and electrodes are provided to form a matrix      display in which individual electrochemical filled cavities extend between      a matrix of row and column electrodes but with each of the individual      cavities extending into communication with the elongated horizontally      extending fluid cavity so that all individual cavities can be filled by      filling a small number of elongated row cavities. This arrangement      provides coincident matrix selection of the individual display elements to      reduce the complexity of the electrical drive circuit by eliminating the      need for a separate individually controlled electrical connection for each      display element. </PAR><PAR>  U.S. Pat. No. 4,146,876 to Arellano et al. describes a matrix addressed      electrochromic display which includes a first and second spaced part of      opposed plate of panels, a dielectric space of peripherally sealing the      panels to provide an interior cavity therebetween to define a display      region, an electrochromic fluid filling interior cavity, a plurality of      parallel rows and columns of electrodes disposed in the mating surfaces of      the first and second panels respectively and a low output impedance      electrical refresh circuit coupled to electrically energize the electrodes      in a repetitive matrix selection pattern to provide a selected dot matrix      display. </PAR><PAR>  Electrochromic displays have many other uses for example, in U.S. Pat. No.      4,141,236 to Ellington describes a shock absorber coupled to an integrated      circuit to measure the force/velocity characteristic of the shock absorber      when the characteristic falls outside a predetermined value, the circuit      delivers an electrical output to an electrochromic color change cell to      indicate failure of the shock absorber. U.S. Pat. No. 4,501,472 to      Nicholson et al. describes a tunable electrochromic filter using an      electrochromic cell. The electrochromic cells described in the present      invention have a wide variation in color change and are therefore useful      as an electrochemically tunable optical filter. Moreover, the      electrochemical materials of the present invention have a wide variation      of ultraviolet absorption and are therefore useful as a ultraviolet      filter. </PAR><PAR>  The preferred electrochemical solutions according to the present invention      include an intermolecular charge transfer salt in a solvent. Examples of      types of solvents are nitriles, nitro compounds, amides, cyclic amides,      amines, esters, cyclic esters, carbonates, oxides and sulfo compounds.      This list is exemplary only and not limiting. The following is a      exemplarly list of solvents acetonitrile, N,N-dimethylformamide,      N-methylformamide, N,N-diethylformamide, N-ethylformamide,      N,N-dimethylacetamide, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, hexamethylphosphoramide,      propylene carbonate, ethylene carbonate, .gamma.-butyrolactone,      dimethylsulfoxide, acetone, sulfolane, water and alcohols. </PAR><PAR>  In addition, the electrochemical solutions will include in the solution a      supporting electrolyte and preferably a supporting electrolyte salt that      contains as cation a member from one of the following groups:      tetraalkylammoniu, tetraalkylphosphonium, alkali metal,      aryl-alkylammonium, aryl-alkylphosphonium, or chelated metal. The      preferred tetraalkylammonium group is tetrabutylammonium, but other      tetraalkyls with alkyl group being methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl,      pentyl, hexyl, or mixed alkyl thereof can be employed if desired. An      example of a typical aryl group is phenyl and an aryl-alkylammonium is      benzyltributylammonium. An example of a chelated metal cation is potassium      18-crown-6. The supporting electrolyte salt preferably contains as anion      one of the following: tetrafluoroborate, hexafluorophosphate, aryl      sulfonate, perchlorate, or halide such as bromide or iodide. </PAR><PAR>  Because organic charge transfer salts contain redox couples they are      candidates for color active agents in electrochromic devices. Organic      charge transfer salts have been of interest in recent years, since the      discovery of the metallic conductivity of the TTF-TCNQ ionic      intermolecular charge transfer salt, as reported in J. Am. Chem. Soc.      1973, 95, 948-949 by Ferraris et al. and in Solid State Commun. 1973, 12,      1125-1132 by Coleman et al. </PAR><PAR>  The TCNQ radical anion forms organic semiconductors with a large number of      cations. For example, K.sub.andplus; and N-methylquinolinium (NNQn.sup.andplus;) salts      with TCNQ have room temperature conductivities      .perspectiveto.5.times.10.sup.-4 and .perspectiveto.10.sup.-6 ohm.sup.-1      centimeters.sup.-1 respectively. The cations in these intermolecular or      ionic charge transfer salts are electron donors. </PAR><PAR>  TCNQ has been found to form a few compounds with conductivities as high as      10.sup.andplus;2 ohms.sup.-1 cm.sup.-1. Many of these salts have a 1:2 ratio of      cation to TCNQ, such as Et.sub.3 NH-(TCNQ).sub.2, but a few form 1:1 salt.      A primary example is N-methylphenazinium, NMP-TCNQ. </PAR><PAR>  Substantial increase in the conductivity of intermolecular TCNQ salts was      discovered in the prior art. It was found that the high conductivity is      associated with crystal structures in which the intermolecular TCNQ salts      are packed face to face, like a deck of playing cards, with segregated      stacks of cations and TCNQ anions. FIG. 12 schematically shows such a      stack where D represents the donor or cation and A represent the acceptor      or anion. In an intermolecular charge transfer salt the dashed lines in      FIG. 12 represent an ionic interaction between discrete cations and      anions. In an intramolecular charge transfer salt the dashed line      represents covalent bonding between the donor and acceptor parts of a      covalently linked molecule. </PAR><PAR>  The .pi.-overlap and charge-transfer interaction between adjacent molecules      in the stacking direction z are strong, causing therein unpaired electrons      to be partially delocalized along one of these one dimensional molecular      stacks and enabling them to conduct in that direction. The .pi.-bonds are      represented in FIG. 12 by the dotted lines between the stacked D's and the      stacked A's. Between adjacent donor and acceptor molecules there is a      transfer of charge. The donor molecule transferring either an entire      electron or a fractional part of an electron to the acceptor. In FIG. 12      the degree of electron transfer is designated by the symbol .rho., which      has a value between 0 and 1. For a value of .rho. equal to 0 there is no      transfer of an electron from the donor to the acceptor. For a value of      .rho. equalling to one there is complete transfer of an electron to the      acceptor. For a value of .rho. between 0 and 1 there is partial transfer      of the electron from the donor to the acceptor. </PAR><PAR>  The overlapping .pi. bonds between adjacent donors and between adjacent      acceptors form energy bands in similar fashion to an energy band in solid      state materials. When .rho. is either 0 or 1 for a crystallized material      represented by FIG. 12 the material has energy bands either completely      filled or completely empty of electrons and is therefore, either an      insulator or semiconductor depending upon the energy separation between      the highest completely filled energy band and the lowest completely empty      energy band. When .rho. has a value between 0 and 1 which corresponds to      partial electron transfer the highest energy band which contains electrons      is generally partially filled and therefore corresponds to a metallic like      conductor. </PAR><PAR>  In an article in J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1983, 105, 4468-4469 to Becker et al.,      the potential benefits of an intramolecular charge transfer salt over an      intramolecular transfer salt have been described. However, Becker does not      describe the actual synthesis of an intramolecular charge transfer salt. </PAR><PAR>  The benefits of an intramolecular charge transfer salt as pointed out by      Becker et al. is to design efficient organic conductors which are composed      of donor (D) and acceptor (A) moieties by achieving the following      necessary conditions; (a) enforce a segregated mode of stacking (. . . DD      . . . .parallel. . . . AA . . . ) in the solid state; (b) control the D:A      stoichiometry; (c) encode ab initio the desired degre of electron transfer      (.rho.) into the molecular unit; (d) stabilize the delocalized state, . .      . D.sup..rho.andplus; D.sup..rho.andplus; . . . .parallel.A.sup..rho.- A.sup..rho.- . .      . , below the localized ones, e.g., . . . D.sup.andplus; D . . .      .parallel.A.sup.- A . . . ); (e) permit and control the degree of      interchain coupling. Becker points out that the systematic control of      these conditions will allow the preparation of organic conductors with      predesigned properties. In the conditions (a) and (d) the segregated mode      stacking is shown as . . . DD . . . this represents the vertical stack of      D's in FIG. 12. Also, the . . . AA . . . represents the vertical row of      A's in FIG. 12. The double vertical lines separating the D's and the A's      corresponds to the bonding between the D's and the A's, shown in FIG. 12      as a dotted line. </PAR><PAR>  Becker et al. refers to an archetypal molecular unit Dm-An which contains      both donor and acceptor moieties in a prefixed stociometric ratio (n:m),      which is potentially endowed with the necessary properties that can be      calculated to meet the requirements of conditions b to d above. </PAR><PAR>  Becker reports a model archetypal molecular unit,      2,5-dibenzyl-7,7,88-tetra-cyano-p-quinodimethane (DBTCNQ). Becker points      out that this molecule contains a weak donor (e.g. phenyl), and that this      material was expected not to be a ground state conductor. Becker further      points out that this compound shows promise for the strategy underlined in      criteria (a)-(e). Therefore it is clear from the teaching that Becker has      not fabricated an intramolecular charge transfer salt. </PAR><PAR>  The model compound of Becker consists of two benzene rings linked to a TCNQ      acceptor. The reason why this compound is not an intramolecular charge      transfer salt is that the reduction potential of the benzene      radical-cation is too positive relative to the reduction potential of the      TCNQ moiety. This means that it is not energetically favorable to transfer      an electron from the benzene ring to the TCNQ moiety. The potentials in      question are: </PAR><EQU>  TCNQ(0)andplus;e.sup.- .fwdarw.TCNQ(-)andplus;0.127V vs SCE </EQU><PA1>  Reference: &quot;Electrochemical Methods&quot; by A. J. Bard L. R. Faulkner.

The redox potential of a toluene      is used instead of the potential for a benzene ring since toluene is a      better match for the substituted in benzene in the Becker molecule. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 13 and FIG. 14 are schematic representations of the relationship of      the redox potentials of the donor and acceptor moieties of an      intermolecular charge transfer salt and an intramolecular charge transfer      salt. FIG. 13 shows two peaks on a plot which represent two distinct redox      couples. The vertical axis is an arbitrary scale of density of electronic      states. The horizontal axis is an arbitrary scale of electric potential      (the scale of energy E is also indicated). Since E is equal to      -.vertline.e.vertline. P, the energy scale is inversed to that of the      potential scale. A redox couple is an energy location on a molecule which      is capable of reversibly receiving or giving up an electron. For an      intramolecular charge transfer salt the redox couples 200 and 202 would be      different moieties on the same molecule. For an intermolecular charge      transfer salt the redox peaks 200 and 202 would represent redox couples on      different molecules. The redox couple on each molecule has a molecular      orbital with an energy level into which the electron is deposited. The      spreading in the energies of the redox couples 200 and 202 arises because      in a collection of molecules each electron is added to a molecular orbital      of a distinct molecule. Energies of the remaining unoccupied molecular      orbitals of other molecules are affected by the filled molecular orbitals      and increase in energy. This causes the spread in energy of the redox      couples. If redox couple 200 represents a collection of molecules      containing an electron in the redox couple these molecules are potential      donors. Assuming that the redox couples 202 are unoccupied by electrons      since they are at a potential more positive than the redox couple 200 or      in other terms at a lower energy than the redox couple 200 the electrons      in the redox couple 200 can transfer to the redox couple 202. This      corresponds to complete electron charge transfer referred to herein and      above. If redox couple 202 is completely occupied with electrons and redox      couple 200 is completely empty of electrons, since redox couple 202 is at      a potential more positive of redox 200 or in other words since redox      couple 202 is at a lower energy level than redox couple 200 electrons in      redox couple 202 will not transfer to redox couple 202. This corresponds      to the condition of no electron transfer referred to herein and above. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 14 represents the condition where the redox couples 200 and 202      overlap which is indicated by the shaded region 203 in FIG. 14. If redox      couple 200 is completely filled with electron and redox couple 202 is      completely empty, redox couple 200 represents a potential electron donor.      Since redox couple 202 is at a potential more positive than redox couple      200 the electrons in redox couple 200 can transfer to redox couple 202.      However, because of the overlap region 204 electrons can remain in redox      couple 200. This corresponds to the condition of partial electron transfer      since the electron can occupy both redox couples 200 and 202. For the      condition where redox couple 202 is filled with electrons and redox couple      200 is completely empty of electrons, redox couple 202 is a potential      electron donor. However, since redox couple 202 is at a potential more      positive of redox couple 200 most of the electrons remain in redox couple      202. However, because of the overlap region 203 the electrons can occupy      redox couple 200. This also corresponds to the condition of partial      electron transfer. The degree of partial electron transfer depends upon      the amount of overlap of the couples 200 and 202. </PAR><PAR>  The applicants are the first to synthesize an intramolecular charge      transfer salt for which it is contemplated that partial electron transfer      between an electron donor moiety and an electron acceptor moiety on the      same covalent molecule can be achieved in the solid and polymeric to form      ionic, semiconducting and metallic state. For the sake of clarity,      synthesis of, and use of the intramolecular charge transfer salt will be      described in terms of a preferred embodiment containing a viologen donor      and an aromatic bis-imide acceptor, which has five distinct oxidation      states and four redox couples which has a corresponding wide variation in      color change which makes it useful for electrochromic display devices. The      synthesis can generally be described as reacting a monoalkylated viologen      with an unsymmetrical bis-imide containing a leaving group suitable for      undergoing a displacement reaction. The bis-imide is preferably in excess,      most preferably 0.5M excess. It is contemplated that this method can be      generalized to violenes and cyanines and to compound having an carbonyl      group conjugated to an aromatic moiety. It will be readily apparent to the      artisan that this method generalizable to violenes and cyanines reacted      with compounds having a carbonyl group conjugated to an aromatic moiety.      Generally, organic molecules having multiple redox couples show multiple      color variation on electrochemically populating and depopulating redox      couples. The viologen bis-imide intramolecular compound described herein      is unusual in that it has five oxidation states permitting a very wide      variation in color change. Applicants have also discovered that an      electrolyte solution containing a compound having a viologen moiety and      containing a compound having a bis-imide moiety when there is no covalent      link between these two molecules also shows five oxidation states which      also shows a very large variation in color change. The violene, family of      compounds is described in Pure Appl. Chem. 1967, 15, 109-122 to Hunig and      in Top. Curr. Chem. 1980, 92, 1-44 to Hunig et al. The teachings of both      of the Hunig articles are incorporated herein by reference. Violenes are      preferred. The most preferred donor embodiment is a viologen which is a      member of the violene family of compounds. The most preferred viologen is      ethyl viologen which has the following structural formula where I.sup.- is      an iodide ion      ##STR1## </PAR><PAR>  The bis-imide material of this preferred embodiment is      N,N'-dibutylpyromellitimide which has the following structural formula      where Buandequals;n-butyl or CH.sub.3 CH.sub.2 CH.sub.2 CH.sub.2 in Compound 15:      ##STR2## </PAR><PAR>  The violene family of compounds exist in three distinct oxidation states      and therefore has two redox couples.

As can be seen from the Table there      is an overlap in the reduction potentials of compounds 14 and 15. Such an      overlap in reduction potential can lead to partial electron transfer as      described herein above which can lead to electrical conductivity in the      solid state. </PAR><TBL>                TABLE                                                            ______________________________________                                         Reduction Potential for 14 and 15                                              Compound         .sup.1 E.sub.1/2                                                                       .sup.2 E.sub.1/2                                      ______________________________________                                         14               -0.370  -0.752                                                15               -0.685  -1.392                                                ______________________________________                                          Reduction potentials measured by cyclic voltammetry vs. SCE at 0.5 mM in       DMF/0.1 M Bu.sub.4 NBF.sub.4.                                             </TBL><PAR>  The following sequence of equations represents the reversible addition of      four electrons to the linked compound 16.

Then, because the reduction potential for      adding a first electron to the imide is 67 mV more positive than that for      adding another to the viologen, the second electron would reduce the imide      unit leading to a radical-cation/radical-anion. This has been explored      using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and by bulk electrolysis monitored      spectroscopically. Both the compound 16, in which two moieties are      covalently linked and an equimolar mixture of 14 and 15 have been studied.      The CV of the linked compound 16 is shown in FIG. 2. The CV for the      mixture of compound 14 and 15 is shown in FIG. 5. The CV's for both the      linked compound and the mixture can be readily understood as a      superposition of the CV of the imide on that of the viologen. In the      cyclic voltammograms of FIG. 2 and FIG. 5 the voltage of a working      electrode is scanned from 0 volts (vs. SCE) to a negative potential which      is insufficient to electrolyze the electrolyte. The voltage is then ramped      back to 0. The lower part of the curves corresponds to the reduction of      the redox couple or adding electrons thereto; the upper part of the curve      corresponds to the oxidation of redox couples or extracting the electrons      therefrom. Referring to FIG. 2, peak 204 corresponds to the transition      from equation 17 to equation 18, peak 206 corresponds to a super position      of the transition from equation 18 to equation 19 and from equation 19 to      equation 20, peak 208 corresponds to the transition of equation 20 to      equation 21, peak 210 corresponds to the transition from equation 21 to      equation 20, peak 212 corresponds to the super position of the transition      from equation 20 to equation 19 and the transition of equation 19 to      equation 18, and peak 214 corresponds to the transition from equation 18      to equation 17. A similar analysis corresponds to FIG. 5. Note that the      middle peak 206 and 212 in FIG. 2 and 216 and 218 in FIG. 5 are roughly      twice the height of the other two peaks because it is the result of the      two redox couples--the first imide reduction and the second viologen      reduction--which are not well resolved in the CV. </PAR><PAR>  Bulk electrolysis of compound 16 in dimethylformamide (DMF) was done in a      glove box, and samples were removed periodically for UV-VIS spectroscopy.      Electrolysis at -0.6 V (vs. standard calomel electrode, SCE) generated the      characteristic spectrum of the viologen radical-cations. The solution was      then reduced further until a rest potential of E.sub.soln andequals;-0.70 V was      obtained, which resulted in a species showing absorptions for both the      viologen radical-cation and the pyromellitimide radical-anion which is      shown in FIG. 3. Further electrolysis to E.sub.soln andequals;-0.75, -0.79 -1.40 V      leads first to the disappearance of the radical-cation absorption and then      to the appearance of absorptions of the neutral quinoid form of the      viologen, then to the disappearance of the pyromellitimide radical-anion      absorption in appearance of the dianion absorption. Thus, the      electrochemistry of the compound of equation 16 traverses five states:      colorless dicatation, blue radical-cation, blue-green      radical-cation/radical-anion, green radical-anion and rose dianion. </PAR><PAR>  The radical-cation/radical-anion is an unusual structure for an organic      molecule in its ground state, i.e. a state not populated by a photo      excited state. From both the CV and UV-VIS results, it is clear that there      is little interaction between the unpaired electrons as might have been      predicted from the length and relative rigidity of the aralkyl linkage. </PAR><PAR>  Bulk electrolysis of the viologen 14 was performed until it was completely      converted to the neutral form. Under ambient conditions the stable form of      the viologen 14 is the dicationic form where the two positive changes are      balanced by two anions which in compound 14 is two iodide ions or      2I.crclbar.. At this point, addition of an equal or more amount of the      un-reduced imide 15 rapidly resulted on a UV-VIS spectrum (as shown in      FIG. 11) very similar to that of the doubly reduced form of the compound      16. This is represented by the following equation: </PAR><EQU>  14.sup.0 andplus;15.sup.0 .fwdarw.14.sup.andplus;. andplus;15.sup.-. </EQU><PAR>  By confirming that the radical-cation/radical-anion pair can be generated      from the pair of compounds in a neutral state, which are clearly      electronic ground states, this last experiment validates the description      of the doubly reduced linked compound in a ground state      radical-cation/radical-anion. In the sequence of equations 17-21, the      bis-imide moiety acts as an acceptor and the viologen moiety acts as a      donor. For the purpose of the present application an intermolecular charge      transfer salt refers to all the oxidation states as represented by      equations 17-21. For the purpose of the present application, an      intermolecular charge transfer salt corresponds to a corresponding full      sequence of oxidation states for non-linked compounds which corresponds to      those of equation 17-21. </PAR><PAR>  The present invention is not limited to five oxidation states but can      include many more than five oxidation states. The redox potentials as      shown in FIGS. 2 and 5 can be adjusted by different structural variations      of the donor and acceptor moieties, for example, by forming substituted      forms of the donor and acceptor moeity. Adjusting the redox potentials of      compounds by forming structural variations are described in Proceedings Of      The Symposium On Polymeric Materials For Electronic Packaging and High      Technology Applications, Vol. 88-17, The Electrochemical Society Inc.;      Pennington, N.J. pp 88-102, (1988) Viehbeck et al., the teaching of which      is incorporated herein by reference, and in Metallized Polymers, ACS      Symposium Series, American Chemical Society, Washington, D.C., in press      exp. June 1990 to Viehbeck et al., the teaching of which is incorporated      herein by reference. It is contemplated that such adjustments of the redox      potentials can be done to achieve electrically conducting organic polymers      in the solid state. </PAR><PAR>  The synthesis of a viologen bis-imide, in particular compound 16, will now      be described. Electrochemical reduction of viologen bis-imide (16) led to      five distinct redox states that were characterized by cyclic voltammetry      and ultraviolet/visible spectroscopy. The ability of a bis-imide to accept      one and two electrons to give radical-anion and a dianion, respectively,      has been established by Viehbeck et al. as incorporated by reference      above. There exists a whole family of compounds whose redox activity is      exactly complementary to that of bis-imides. These compounds termed      violenes as described above (for example, the dialkylbipyridinium salts)      can exist in one of three states: dication, radical cation, and the      uncharged state. A compound containing a bis-imide covalently attached to      a dialkylbipyridinium salt could therefore exhibit five oxidation states.      Of particular interest is the state where one end of the molecule exists      as a radical-cation and the other a radical-anion--a highly unusual      chemical structure. </PAR><PAR>  Pyromellitimides, in general, are very insoluble in most organic solvents.      Thus pyromellitimide 2 was completely insoluble in all organic solvents      tried.      ##STR5## </PAR><PAR>  Solubility of the viologen bis-imide 16 was a key to being able to      characterize the molecule electrochemically. To achieve this, we resorted      to an unsymmetrical pyromellitimide 3, which has an alkyl imide ring on      one side and an aryl imide on the other. A longer chain alkyl, namely a      butyl group, was used to help solubilize the planar structure. The aralkyl      spacer between the viologen and bissimide provided a semi-rigid spacer to      minimize electronic interaction between the two portions of the molecule. </PAR><PAR>  We chose to create the dissymmetry in 3 by a Diels-Alder reaction of      N-butyl maleimide and 3,4-dicarbomethoxyfuran, aromatizing the Diels-Alder      adduct with dilute acid; and, operating on the ester functionality to      incorporate a differently substituted imide. However, aromatizing compound      4 posed tremendous difficulty (Scheme 1). The four electron withdrawing      groups in molecule 4 did not support carbocation formation conditions.      Hence in spite of its strained structure, 4, was completely resistant even      to strong acids. The exo nature of the Diels-Alder adduct also made it      impossible to ring open the oxygen bridge using lithium diisopropylamide.      ##STR6## </PAR><PAR>  McMurry's deoxygenation methodology, (as described in Heterocycles 1983,      20, 1985; Wong, H. N. C., the teaching of which is incorporated herein by      reference) using low valent titanium species to deoxygenate 4, produced      low yields of the aromatized product. However, the reaction works very      well on 1,4 cyclohexadiene systems. We therefore chose molecule 5 as our      key intermediate towards the synthesis of the viologen bisimide. The      difference in reactivity between benzyl esters and methyl esters was used      to create the dissymetry needed in the imide portion of the molecule.      Dibenzyl acetylenedicarboxylate was prepared using the procedure described      in J. C. S. Perkin Trans I 1973, 23, 2024 to G. Low et al. the teaching of      which is incorporated herein by reference. The formation of dibenzyl ether      in the esterification reaction was minimized by carrying out the      distillation of benzyl alcohol rapidly. The dibenzyl has a low flash      point. It is therefore recommened to cool the flask to room temperature      before introduction of air into the system. The Diels-Alder reaction of      dibenzyl acetylenedicarboxylate and 3,4-dicarbomethoxyfuran proceeded in a      respectable yield of 50% (5 ). Deoxygenation of 6 using the McMurry's      reagent (TiCl.sub.4 /LAH/NEt.sub.3) in dimethoxyethane (DME) led to a 60%      yield of the pyromellitic tetraester 7. Using THF as the solvent led to      considerable poly-THF formation under the reaction conditions. Thus      changing the solvent from THF to DME raised the yield in the deoxygenation      reported in the article of Wong referred to herein above, on the      corresponding tetramethyl ester from 49% to 85%. </PAR><PAR>  Hydrogenolysis of the tetraester 6 proceeded in near quantitative yield to      3,4-dicarbomethoxyphthalic acid 7. Acetic anhydride reflux of the phthalic      acid 7 led to the formation of 3,4-dicarbomethoxyphthalic anhydride, 8, in      a 75% yield. Imidization of the anhydride 8 had to be done with distilled      butylamine and purified 8 used in an exact 1:1 ratio. Excess butylamine      reacted with the esters under the imidization conditions to give the      bis-butyl imide. The methyl esters were then cleaved using LiI in pyridine      to the diacid 10 in a near quantitative yield. Using pyridine as the      solvent which reacted with the methyl iodide formed in the reaction,      forced the reaction in the forward direction leading to the high yield.      The diacid was then dehydrated with acetic anhydride to give the anhydride      11. The second imidization with 4-aminophenethyl alcohol proceeded      smoothly to yield 3 (67%). The alcohol 3 was then converted to the      mesylate 12 in spite of its sparing solubility in methylene chloride and      most other solvents, using a dilute solution of the alcohol in methylene      chloride and standard conditions for the reaction. </PAR><PAR>  Monoethylbipyridinium iodide was made by refluxing bipyridyl hydrate with      ethyl iodide in acetonitrile as described in Tetrahedron, 1981, 37, 4185      to I. Tabushi et al. the teaching of which is incorporated herein by      reference. The final step in the synthesis, the displacement reaction of      the mesylate in 12 by the nitrogen in the monoethylbipyridyl iodide,      required a 0.5 mole excess of the mesylate in order for the reaction to go      to completion. The yield on the last step was 65%.      ##STR7## </PAR><PAR>  Many variations are possible at the second imidization step. One important      variation in particular is the identity and length of the spacer group      between the bis-imide and violene moieties. Of particular interest are      oxyethylene spacers of the indication that polyimides containing      oxyethylene chains were unusually crystalline as described in Polymer      Preprints, 1985, 26 (2), 287 to Harris, F.

Lithium aluminum      hydride (LAH, 120 mg, 3 mmol) was added very cautiously so as to avoid      abrasion which can cause the LAH to ignite. The yellow solid dispersed,      the color changed to green and finally to black. The cooling bath was      removed. Triethylamine (1 mL, 7.2 mmol) was added and the contents of the      flask were refluxed at 85.degree. C. for 15 min. The flask was then cooled      to room temperature.

Mohammad, J. Org. Chem. 1987, 52,      2779-2782.), diethyl viologen diiodide was reduced by stirring in      acctonitrile over magnesium turnings for 12-24 hours. This reaction and      all subsequent steps were carried out in a nitrogen glove box. The      red-orange solution was decanted from the excess magnesium and evaporated.      The solid residue was dissolved in pure n-heptane (distilled under      nitrogen from sodium). The heptane solution was passed through an      ultrafine fritted glass filter to remove magnesium iodide, then      evaporated. The darkly colored residue was then dissolved in pure      dimethoxyethane (DME, distilled from sodium under nitrogen). The      concentration of reduced viologen in the solution was measured by      coulometry of a 1-ml aliquot in 50 ml of 0.1M tetrabutylammonium      fluoroborate in dimethylformamide. This concentration was then used to      calculate an equimolar amount of N,N-dibutylpyromellitimide which was      weighed and dissolved in the DME solution of reduced viologen. Dilution of      the homogeneous solution with 3-4 times its volume of n-heptane and      chilling at -20.degree. C. resulted in precipitation of a fine, purple      powder. Four point probe measurements of pressed pellets of this powder      showed conductivities of 10.sup.3 -10.sup.4 S/cm. under argon.      Conductivity degraded in air. </PAR><PAR>  Small crystals of this material were obtained by exposing the DME solution      of the 1:1 viologen/pyromellitimide mixture to n-heptane vapors in a      closed container. Slow inter-diffusion of the solvents resulted in crystal      growth at the bottom of the container which originally contained the DME      solution. According to the teachings of the present invention      electrochemically color changing films can be formed. For example, a      violene or cyanine, e.g. a viologen, can be polymerized and disposed onto      an electrode. A counterion and a monomeric compound having an imide group      conjugated to an aromatic moiety, e.g. a bis-imide, can be deposited onto      the film into which it is absorbed to form a color changing film.      Alternatively, the compound containing a carbonyl group conjugated to an      aromatic moiety, e.g. a bis-imide, can be polymerized and disposed onto an      electrode and a violene or cyanine can be disposed onto the polymer into      which it is absorbed to form an electrochemical color changing film. By      the methods of the present invention it is contemplated that these films      can be made electrically conductive. U.S. Pat. No. 4,571,029 to Skotheim      et al., the teaching of which is incorporated herein by reference, teaches      an electrochemical color change cell having a conducting polymer on an      electrode. The conducting polymer contains color changing pigments which      change color when the voltage is changed between the display electrode and      the counter electrode.
