(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jim Bakker proposed a $165 million planWednesday to buy back PTL, and said he is confident he will regaincontrol of the ministry he lost last year in a sex-and-moneyscandal.   Bakker and his attorney, Jim Toms, met with PTL bankruptcytrustee M.C. ``Red'' Benton to present a rough draft of the plan.   ``We've discussed the terms; we've agreed on everything,''Benton said. ``The lawyers are now documenting it and as soon asthe papers are ready tomorrow afternoon, and everybody's agreed, weprobably will both sign it and then we'll have us a deal.''   Canadian real estate magnate Peter Thomas, chairman of SamothCapital Corp., earlier offered $113 million to buy the ministry'sassets.   Thomas said Wednesday he was unwilling to increase his offer butwas skeptical of Bakker's proposal.   ``Although Samoth enjoys first right of refusal, it does notintend at this point to enter into a bidding war,'' Thomas saidfrom his office in Vancouver.   Thomas said if Bakker's bid fails to materialize, he may renewhis proposal. Bakker ``has been all talk so far'' and unwilling toreveal his financial backers, he said. ``It makes one wonder wherehe's getting the cash from.''   Bakker said he had the financial backing for a purchase thatwould total at least $165 million, including $70 million in cashput up at closing. Part of the terms of securing a loan to back hisoffer was that he not reveal the identity of the lender, he said.   PTL filed for reorganization in U.S. Bankruptcy Court inColumbia in June 1987. Donations had plummeted after Bakker leftthe ministry in March amid allegations of misuse of money andrevelations of a sexual encounter several years earlier with churchsecretary Jessica Hahn.   When he announced the outcome of the meeting with Benton, Bakkerwas greeted at the offices of the Jim and Tammy Ministries, his neworganization, by applause and cheers of ``Praise God!'' and ``Thankyou, Jesus!''   ``As it stands now, we will be able to have Heritage USA. It'sbeen a long wait,'' Bakker told volunteers, friends and familymembers, many of whom wept with joy.   ``We're through the basic negotiations. We just had a fewchanges to make in our plan,'' Bakker said. ``We'll be workingtonight, burning the midnight oil, and finish the details fortomorrow.''   Benton had said that he wanted all bids for the ministry'sassets in before Thursday. Benton will then recommend a buyer toBankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds, who has the final decision, bySept. 10.   ``When you boil it all down, it's a matter of who would providethe most dollars for the creditors,'' the trustee said. ``Myresponsibility in this case was to preserve the assets and sellthem at the highest possible dollar value so that the creditorscould be repaid, if possible, in full.''   In addition to the $70 million cash, Bakker said, about $80million would be held to restore the benefits of the ``lifetimepartners'' _ large contributors to PTL who had been promisedlong-term perquisites in exchange for their support; and up to $15million would be used to settle claims against Bakker.   The ministry's assets include the Heritage USA theme park nearhere. With extra funds for improvements and repairs at the park,the final purchase plan could total $200 million, Toms said.</TEXT></DOC>
