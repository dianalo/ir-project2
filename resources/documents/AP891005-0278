MARTINEZ</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The dollar took a surprising leap in hectictrading Thursday, defying efforts by European central banks todrive the currency lower by raising interest rates.   The West German central bank led the rate hike, boosting its keylending rates by 1 percentage point, bringing the discount rate to6 percent and the Lombard rate to 8 percent. It was quickly matchedby Britain, Austria and the Netherlands. France and Switzerlandannounced smaller increases.   But the dollar, after falling briefly, staged a surprisingreversal against all major currencies except the British pound,surpassing levels before the interest-rate announcement.   ``The feeling was that the dollar would take a brief hit, thenbuying would come in,'' said William Sterling, manager ofinternational economics for Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. ``But so manypeople were waiting to buy on the dip that the dip never got below1.86 (marks). That's a testimony to the strong demand for dollarsby international investors and corporations.''   In Europe, the dollar closed at 1.8845 West German marks, upfrom 1.8770. In New York, the dollar traded at 1.8848 West Germanmarks, higher than 1.8815 on Wednesday.   The dollar closed at 141.05 Japanese yen in Tokyo, up from140.60 yen. In London, the currency traded at 142.30 yen comparedwith 141.05 on Wednesday. In New York, the dollar rose to 142.55,up from 141.475.   But in London, one British pound cost $1.6100, more for buyersthan Wednesday's late $1.6055 after the Bank of England raisedinterest rates by 1 percentage point to 15 percent. In New Yorktrading the pound changed hands at $1.6115, more expensive than$1.6020 late Wednesday.   Analysts said the interest-rate hikes were intended as thesecond phase of a two-part effort by industrialized countries topush the dollar lower and stem inflationary pressures, making theircurrencies more attractive to investors.   The first step began last week with central banks sellingdollars in a coordinated effort following a meeting of the Group ofSeven industrialized nations. But the currency repeatedly defiedcentral bank intervention.   Earlier in the week analysts concluded that currency markets hadprepared for a half-point rise and that a steeper hike would zapthe dollar's strength.   All seven nations, including the United States, Britain, Japan,France, West Germany, Italy and Canada, have ample reason to wantthe dollar lower.   ``The worry is that the strong dollar will hurt U.S. economicgrowth in 1990 and hurt the industrial and export sectors,'' saidAllen Sinai, an economist with Boston Co. and Economic AdvisersInc. ``In Japan and West German even bigger doses of interest rateswill be required because of the inflationary effects of weakercurrencies.''   The dollar's strength despite the interest-rate hike calls intoquestion the Group of Seven's ability to mount a coordinatedeffort, economists said.   ``The perception is that each major group is conducting interestrate policy with an eye on its own domestic conditions and that thecredibility of G-7 coordination is still lacking,'' said Sterling.   Analysts said that while intervention is expected to continue,to weaken the dollar will require: adverse news about the tradedeficit, more interest rate hikes or fiscal restraint overseas, orlower short-term interest rates.   New data on employment is due out on Friday, but barring anystrong suggestions that the U.S. economy is slowing, the FederalReserve is not likely to lower interest rates.   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with lateWednesday's rates, included: 1.6360 Swiss francs, up from 1.6290;1.17625 Canadian dollars, up from 1.17475; 6.3865 French francs, upfrom 6.3825; and 1,380.00 Italian lire, up from 1,376.75.
