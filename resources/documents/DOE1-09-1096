The criterion appliedby the court is the question of whether the foreigner is affected withinthe meaning of section 42, sub-sec. 2 VerwGO. The Federal AdministrativeCourt only examines the possible infringement of a third party protectinglaw. If this is the case, the person affected by such infringement hasthe right of action, also if this person is a foreigner. The Court'sjudgement does not refer to any Basic Law rights, which the author commentsto be right. The decision of the Court, he says, represents an interpretationof procedural law that reveals the will to enhance the impact of internationallaws on national law systems, and thus is an appreciable step towardsa 'Europe without borderlines'.
