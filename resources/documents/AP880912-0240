The count dipped by four in last week's tally to total 933. Ayear ago this week, the count was 1,108, the company said Monday.   Baker Hughes' rig count, the widely watched industry index ofdrilling activity, reflects the number of rigs actively exploringfor oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs producing oil.   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company thatmerged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kepttrack of the number of working rigs since 1940.   The rig count reached a peak of 4,500 active rigs in December1981, which was the height of the oil boom. But oil prices plungedto less than $10 per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 and therig count went with it, dropping to 663 _ the lowest since Hughesbegan compiling figures.   Among major oil producing states, Ohio's rig count increased byfive and Texas' count climbed by four. The counts in Colorado andLouisiana each increased by two, while Oklahoma, Pennsylvania andWyoming each increased by one.   New Mexico, Michigan and Kansas each lost one rig.
