So the development of energy inthe USA exerts considerable influence on the supply and demand situationin the international oil markets, and thereby on the development of prices.Contrary to development trends in the remaining industrialized countries,the USA expects to increase its petroleum imports from 1985 to 1995 byapproximately 80%. On the basis of this, a demand for OPEC petroleumon the part of the industrialized countries is calculated which shouldbe, from 1995 on, very near the limit of the OPEC's technical productioncapacity. Such a development might trigger damaging impulses for theoverall economic development of the industrialized countries.</TEXT></DOC>
