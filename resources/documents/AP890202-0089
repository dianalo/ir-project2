The huge C-5 plane was bound for the southern city of PuntaArenas, where its cargo and the 15-member team will be transferredto a U.S. research vessel, the Polar Duke, the U.S. Embassy inSantiago said.   In the Antarctic, U.S. scientists were trying to catch floatingoil barrels and propane containers near the spill, which was fourmiles in diameter and moving to the southwest, the National ScienceFoundation said.   The agency said in Washington the Argentine supply vessel thatreleased the oil after it ran aground and sank was carrying 250,000gallons of diesel fuel. It said an ``incurable disaster'' wouldresult if all the fuel leaks into the region's unspoiled waters.   In Buenos Aires, an Argentine navy spokesman said the spill wouldnot pose a serious ecological threat.   A spokesman for the Chilean navy agreed. ``The information thatwe have is that there is no big spill,'' said Lt. Juan Pablo Barrosin a telephone interview today.   The Bahia Paraiso (Paradise Bay) ran aground on Saturday in theBismarck Strait, 600 miles south of the southern tip of SouthAmerica and 1{ miles from the U.S. Palmer Research Station on theAntarctic Peninsula. The ship was carrying supplies for Antarcticoutposts and sightseers.   All 250 passengers and crew were rescued, but the ship floatedfree in heavy seas and sank Tuesday, dropping barrels of oil andseveral hundred propane gas containers into the water, said JackTalmadge, a spokesman for the National Science Foundation.   Another foundation spokesman in Washington, Jack Renerie, saidmost of the oil was in steel drums so the ecological threat may notbe great. However, ``There's a bunch of free (drifting) oil downthere,'' he said. ``The slick has arrived at Palmer Station,'' ascientific outpost run by the foundation.   Renerie said personnel at the station had collected some steelbarrels of fuel oil and tanks of compressed gas near the ship.   ``The latest we have now is that there's probably 150 to 200barrels (still) in the water,'' Renerie said in a telephoneinterview today from Santiago. ``And there's still oil coming out ofthe ship.''   He said the ship is about ``80 to 90 percent underwater'' butappears to have settled firmly on a shoal.   ``The water surrounding the ship is covered with a couple ofcentimeters (about an inch) of oil. There is a sheen of oil in amuch wider area around the ship, including evidence of oil on thecoastline of the several islands there,'' Talmadge said.   ``Wildlife has already begun to be affected,'' including krill,the small crustaceans that form the basis of the Antarctic foodchain, Talmadge said.   ``Birds which have eaten the krill are showing behaviordifferences,'' he said. ``One dead penguin had been found as of afew hours ago.''   The Air Force transport left Norfolk, Va., on Wednesday and wasto arrive in Chile today. Talmadge said its crew and 52 tons ofcargo would reach the accident site by Monday.   The cargo includes a 35-foot ``skimming boat'' for scooping upspilled oil and pumping it into floating tanks; a small tugboat;inflatable booms to contain the spill, and a special truck forloading and unloading the equipment, said Renerie. He said it wasaccompanied by a crew from two private U.S. clean-up companies,Marine Pollution Control and Global Associates.   The National Science Foundation is organizing the clean-upmission with assistance from the Air Force, Navy and the NationalOceanographic and Atmospheric Administration.</TEXT></DOC>
