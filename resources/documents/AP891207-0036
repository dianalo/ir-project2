While rebels made threatening statements toward theapproximately 100,000 U.S. citizens in the Philippines in responseto Washington's decision, they took no action against Americanstrapped in rebel-held hotels.   Indeed, public indignation largely has focused on Mrs. Aquino'sreliance on U.S. military help in crushing the coup, the mostserious since she took office in February 1986.   ``When push came to shove, this government ... yelled for theYanks. I for one am ashamed,'' wrote respected politicalcommentator Max V. Soliven in the Philippine Daily Star.   ``When a government cannot overcome a rebellion without`outside' help, I hope that this does not make it a colony, asatrap, or a banana republic all over again,'' said Soliven,recalling the half-century when the Philippines was a U.S. colony.   ``How the nation's so-called leaders could possibly justify ...our complete dependence and subservience to a former colonialmaster truly blows the mind,'' chimed in columnist Noel C. Cabrerain The Manila Times.   U.S. F-4 Phantom jets flew air cover Friday for loyalist forces.The jets did not fire on the rebels but prevented them fromcontinuing air strikes targeting the presidential palace andmilitary camps.   Mrs. Aquino had requested military assistance in a telephonecall to President Bush during the first hours of the coup, when thesurvival of her government appeared in doubt.   The air support has been widely viewed as the turning point.   The jets took off from Clark Air Base, about 50 miles north ofManila. It is one of six U.S. military bases in the Philippineswith leases expiring in 1991.   The future of the strategic bases is one of the hotest politicaltopics in the Philippines, and the debate has intensified with theU.S. intervention in the attempted coup.   Base supporters have argued that the installations give theeconomy a needed shot in the arm and provide strategic protectionfrom foreign aggression.   Opponents have claimed the bases, although technically underPhilippine control, are U.S.-run and therefore an affront onnational sovereignty.   Mrs. Aquino's use of Phantoms from Clark, however, has added anew element to the debate _ the bases as ultimate guarantor ofdemocracy in the Philippines.   A resolution drafted Wednesday by the opposition NacionalistaParty of Vice President Salvador Laurel says the bases ``are notdesigned to promote mutual security but to perpetrate U.S. hegemonyin the Philippines.''   It calls for non-renewal of the bases treaties and abrogation ofthe bilateral mutual security treaty.   But House Speaker Ramon Mitra said the U.S. assistance ``wasjust to show the enemy of the people that there is another forcewhich will support President Aquino at a time when our democracy isendangered. It is a nice feeling to have, when you need assistanceit is there. What would have happened if it did not come?''   Although Mrs. Aquino has not expressed a clear position on thebases, she has been willing to negotiate new leases, which would besubject to Senate approval.   Talks that were expected to begin this month may now be delayeduntil 1990 because of the coup attempt.   A senior official at the U.S. Embassy, speaking on condition henot be further identified, said there was ``nothing magic'' about aDecember start to negotiations and said a timetable would depend onthe Philippine side.   He said he did not believe U.S. involvement would make the talksmore difficult, claiming that a ``large number of people ... werevery happy the support came when it (did).''   There has been no sign of widespread anti-American sentiment inthe wake of the coup attempt. This archipelago nation benefits frommuch American aid and investment and has absorbed much of popularU.S. culture.   In fact, when Filipinos were asked to temporarily houseforeigners escaping the heavy fighting in the Makati financialdistrict over the weekend, several people specifically asked forAmericans to be their guests.   Even rebels refused to move against U.S. citizens they held inMakati hotels, saying ``these American tourists are not our enemy.''   But a statement issued in the name of a rebel leader advised theU.S. government to evacuate its nationals and urged Americans topressure Washington ``to refrain from pursuing any policy or actionwhich may trigger a new Philippine-American war.''</TEXT></DOC>
