As recently as 1985, the agency was scheduling 24 flights in1989 alone.   Over the years, the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration had given a proud name to its philosophy for suchambitious planning: ``Success oriented.'' A skeptic would ask, howcan you expect to launch 24 missions in one year, and a NASAofficial would respond, ``It's a success-oriented schedule, butthat's our goal.''   Now, for the first post-Challenger launch, success-oriented hasgiven way to ``safety first.''   Success-oriented is a system in which NASA sets a work schedulethat allows no coasting and presumes no delays. It's a sort ofAnti-Murphy's Law: If anything can go right, it will go right, andat just the right time. In life-or-death circumstances, it is acalculated method for achieving intensity, and maximum results,from the limited tax resources available for spaceflight.   Aim for 48, come as close as you can. (NASA flew 21 flights inthose first five years.)   Before long, the real Murphy's Law often took over. The 24thmission, with celebrity astronaut Rep. Bill Nelson on board, wasrescheduled a record seven times before the congressman and crewfinally was launched into space on Jan. 12, 1986. Landing wasdelayed three times and then rerouted from Florida to California.   The next flight went to Challenger, and its tragic end on Jan.28, 1986, forced NASA to rethink and abandon the success-orientedwork routine.   Instead, the agency moved slowly, cautiously and as quietly aspossible in preparing Discovery for its mission to end NASA's32-month absence from spaceflight.   NASA waited until this past Saturday to set its final launchdate: Thursday, Sept. 29, 9:59 a.m. EDT. At one point, the agencywas so intent on NOT setting a launch date that it cited ahurricane off Texas _ not Florida _ to delay its announcementanother 48 hours.   Success-oriented? Not this time.   Yet, over the years, the NASA doctrine had its good days.   Success oriented put Neil Armstrong on the moon.   It is difficult today to recall how outlandish it seemed in 1961when President Kennedy called on NASA to harness the ``dedication,organization and discipline'' to put man on the moon by 1970.America's space program was in its bumbling infancy. The Sovietshad humiliated the United States with Sputnik and then with YuriGagarin. Alan Shepard had made a suborbital flight, but no Americanhad even orbited the Earth, let alone achieved any of the otherrequirements (rendezvous, space walks, powerful new rocket engines,lunar landing vehicles) that would allow NASA to realize Kennedy'sgoal, ``before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon andreturning him safely to the Earth.''   NASA completed its Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs with asuccess-oriented work regime that provided the United States someof its proudest moments. The approach worked so well that evenafter the Apollo 1 launch pad fire, while mourning threeastronauts, NASA quickly fixed the problem and the program movedforward. A 32-month delay? It was beyond comprehension.   By 1986, though, success-oriented may have been more of aproblem than a solution. The agency had always operatedconservatively, tolerating launch delays whatever the gentleridicule from the public or the media. But there came a tendencyamong some NASA managers to maybe wink at some problems, among theman inadequate booster rocket design. After seven scrubs for theBill Nelson launch, and two delays getting Challenger off theground, NASA rocketry managers didn't want to hear about O-rings onthe morning of Jan. 28, 1986. They wanted to launch, cold weatheror not.   ``I'm appalled at your recommendation,'' a NASA rocket manager,George Hardy, said in disgust to engineers who tried to block thelaunch.   It won't happen that way next week. Safety first will rule theday.   ``It wouldn't surprise me at all if it took us two or threetimes to get airborne,'' says Richard Truly, the ex-astronaut whonow runs the NASA shuttle program. ``We're going to wait until wehave it right, and then we're going to do it.''</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Jonathan Wolman, AP's assistant bureau chief inWashington, has covered the shuttle program since 1981.</TEXT></DOC>
