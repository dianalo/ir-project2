Bush supports the tortured logic of the National RifleAssociation that assault rifles, like the AK47 used in the recentkillings of five schoolchildren in Stockton, Calif., can be used forhunting or target practice.   That could probably also be said about flame throwers and grenadelaunchers, but that's no reason to make those ... things readilyavailable to any nut who can afford the price.   Bush ... wants the states to punish criminals more severely.   Presidential leadership is needed to make it harder to buy gunsthat are used primarily to shoot people and to better screen thosewho buy these guns.   There's no way to get to a kinder, gentler nation with an AK47 onthe shoulder of every homicidal maniac in creation.   The president must realize that, and it's time he said it.</TEXT><TEXT>   Feb. 21   Forum, Fargo, N.D., on a new tax on gasoline:   The drive to reduce the nation's staggering budget deficit hassome members of Congress and the Bush administration seriouslyconsidering imposition of a 50-cent-per-gallon excise tax ongasoline.   That's the wrong approach for at least three reasons.   First, such a tax would unfairly place a larger part of theburden of deficit reduction on rural states. While drivers in thewide-open West pile up more miles on the road than do travelers inurban states where mass transit is available, the additional revenuefrom the gasoline tax would go for deficit reduction rather thanhighway and bridge maintenance. ...   Second, there is convincing evidence additional motor fuels taxesinhibit economic growth. The Department of Energy estimated in 1987that a 25-cent-per-gallon tax would cut the gross national productabout .5 percent.   And finally, higher gasoline taxes would be regressive _especially unfair to lower income people who spend a larger fractionof their incomes on motor fuels than do more affluent drivers.</TEXT><TEXT>   Feb. 20   Hobbs (N.M.) Daily News-Sun on parental choice and public schools:   Already, 13 states give parents the option of selecting superiorschools where their children can receive a good education. PresidentBush, moreover, endorses this free-market strategy of getting themost from U.S. public schools.   The biggest obstacle to this reform is the 1.7-million memberNational Education Association, the nation's largest teachers' union.   NEA lobbyists contend that open enrollment would further dividestudents along economic lines, thereby consigning low incomechildren to educational ghettos.   Such an argument is nonsense, as free choice would liberatedisadvantaged youngsters from inferior ghetto schools.   What the NEA really fears is that its members would have to bemore accountable to the public.   Parental choice may not be a cure-all for the malady afflictingmany of the nation's public schools. But it is the most effectivemeans of motivating those schools to offer much more to theirstudents.</TEXT><TEXT>   Feb. 17   The Huntsville (Ala.) Times on ``The Satanic Verses'':   Iran's extreme reaction to the (Salman) Rushdie novel (``TheSatanic Verses'') should not surprise anyone.   The Islamic fundamentalists who have ruled the country for adecade have imposed the same intolerance at home, killing, torturingand imprisoning even the mildest of dissenters.   Remember, it was Iran's stated intent to export the Islamicrevolution that directly led to the long, bitter war with Iraq. Irancouldn't defeat Iraq, so now it looks elsewhere.   It seems so basic, but it bears repeating: Iran cannot dictate tothe world what books it may read or what ideas it may discuss. Everyculture would like to see all of humanity molded in its likeness,but freedom of expression must remain a common bond in thebrotherhood of man.   Perhaps Iran will someday return to its senses.</TEXT><TEXT>   Feb. 21   St. Louis Post-Dispatch on a U.S.-Japan fighter plane:   Last fall, the U.S.-Japan fighter plane deal appeared set. Butthe Bush administration has delayed a final decision for a month,with different departments arguing whether the plan should go aheadat all.   These second thoughts are warranted. ...   The latest deal involves General Dynamics and Mitsubishi in theFSX ground attack fighter based on the F-16. The Pentagon and theState Department, more interested in short-term political goals,gave the Japanese very liberal terms _ too liberal argue the critics.   Of the $1.2 billion in development costs, the United States willget only 35 to 40 percent of the subcontracts, while Japan will getthe rest as well as all production.   But what is even more troubling is that Tokyo will also getaccess to composite material and building technology that couldallow it to expand its aviation industry, allowing it to competewith the U.S.   The critics are right; the deal should be renegotiated. Thepresent arrangement harms American interests both in the short andthe long term.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
