The largest purchase was made by Chairman Ronald Jackson,who bought 5,500 shares for $126,965 in two separatepurchases in July. Altogether, the eight insiders spent$414,656 on 17,600 Fisher-Price shares, the filings show.</LP><TEXT>   Shares of the East Aurora, N.Y., manufacturer ofpre-school toys began trading on the New York Stock Exchangeon a &quot;when issued&quot; basis on July 1. Holders of Quaker Oatsshares were offered one share for every five Quaker Oatsshares held.   Fisher-Price stock has traded in a narrow $22 to $26.75range. The insiders paid an average price of $23.56 a sharefor their holdings. Yesterday, Fisher-Price closed on the BigBoard at $24, up 37.5 cents.   The company declined to comment on the purchases inadvance of its fiscal first-quarter earnings announcement.   Analysts and money managers regard the stock as somethingof a turnaround situation. Fisher-Price reported a loss forthe fiscal year ended June 30, 1990, chiefly due to itslargely unsuccessful diversification into the &quot;promotional&quot;or character-driven toy business, which resulted in itslosing market share to Hasbro Inc.'s Playskool division,among other competitors, analysts said.   Nonetheless, Wall Street is somewhat bullish on the stockfor three reasons: the company's brand name and reputationfor safety, demographics that favor growth of the toybusiness and the possibility that Fisher-Price could become atakeover target.   &quot;The problems at Fisher-Price,&quot; said Advest Group Inc.analyst Andrew Beja, &quot;are readily correctable, and managementis well on its way to correcting them.&quot;   The University of California endowment fund, which, as alarge Quaker Oats shareholder, got $7 million of Fisher-Pricestock in the spinoff, hasn't made a long-term decision onwhether to keep the shares, said Patricia Small, assistanttreasurer. On the down side, she said, toy stocks arevolatile, since much of the sales come in the fourth quarter,and Fisher-Price management has to &quot;turn the company aroundfrom the very dismal 1990 experience.&quot;   But &quot;we're very pleased that Quaker Oats made it arelatively clean spinoff,&quot; by taking some charges, sellingoff excess inventory and cutting overhead costs, she said,and the endowment fund will hold the stock for now.   ---   INSIDER BUYING ON AN UPSWING:                                                                                                          A look at recent insider buying and selling patterns,broken down by industry, indicates some insiders feel thereare reasons to be bullish about the stock market.   Of the 69 industry groups tracked by Invest/Net, a FortLauderdale, Fla., firm that analyzes SEC insider filings, 23industries showed more insider buying than selling in July.In other words, in those industries, when the number ofshares sold was subtracted from the number of sharespurchased on the open market, the net result was positive --although in some cases the margin was narrow. In June, 19industries showed more buying than selling, and in Mayinsiders were more bullish than bearish in 17 industries.   But while the trend is up, it's still a far cry from lastDecember, when 65 industries showed more insider buying thanselling. The insiders' end-of-the-year bullishness wasfollowed by the big stock market rally in January andFebruary that accounted for much of this year's gain.   As for specific industries, SEC filings show continuedstrong selling at health-care companies, a pick-up in sellingat technology companies and a trickle of selling at airlines.   The industry sector leading in insider selling is thesemiconductor industry. Utility companies lead in insiderbuying.</TEXT></DOC>
