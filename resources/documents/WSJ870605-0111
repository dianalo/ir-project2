Democratic leaders in the House and Senate were trying to sell a plan that would tie a $19.5 billion tax increase to a rise in military spending. But the Democratic majority on the House committee rejected the plan as spending too much on defense.    The leadership was trying to reconcile the differing budgets passed by the House and the Senate. The House-passed budget had a lower defense figure than the Senate's. The proposed compromise was much closer to the Senate's figure.    House Budget Committee Chairman William Gray (D., Pa.) characterized yesterday's setback as &quot;fairly serious.&quot; He explained: &quot;Some of the conferees don't like the defense number. I don't know what the Senate can do.&quot;    The proposed compromise, in its final form, would have set military budget authority at $300 billion for fiscal 1988, which begins Oct. 1, and outlays at $298.6 billion. The Senate's plan called for military budget authority of $301.5 billion and outlays of $290.6 billion. The House budget had $288.7 billion in authority and $281.7 billion in outlays.    Under the proposal, if the president failed to sign tax-increase legislation, military outlays would be $6.9 billion lower than the figure in the compromise document.    But the House Democrats balked at the higher defense figure, and Rep. Gray said he would allow the disagreement to simmer over the weekend before trying again to reach an accord with the Senate.    For their part, Senate Democrats professed shock at the rejection. &quot;We thought we had it,&quot; said a spokesman for Senate Budget Committee Chairman Lawton Chiles (D., Fla.). &quot;There are no plans to meet next week.&quot;    So certain was the Senate of agreement that tables were arranged yesterday in the Senate Budget Committee's hearing room for a meeting of House and Senate members to formally adopt the compromise and send it on for further action.    The compromise budget would have reduced the projected fiscal 1988 budget deficit by $36.8 billion. House Democratic leaders thought they could sell the package to liberal lawmakers because the plan also cut about $1.5 billion less from non-military spending than the House-passed budget.    Under the compromise, the budget deficit would be about $135 billion, much larger than the $108 billion target established in the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law. The compromise calls for less military spending and higher taxes than President Reagan's own plan, which also misses the Gramm-Rudman target. </TEXT></DOC>
