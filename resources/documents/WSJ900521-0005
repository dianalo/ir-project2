Some say it'sapathy, but we say it was a marketing error. The CensusBureau warned in grave tones that if people failed to returntheir forms, they could lose congressional representation.What a brier patch. The prospect of fewer congressional seatsmight seem like an even better alternative than the proposed12-year-term limitation for Congressmen.</LP><TEXT/></DOC>
