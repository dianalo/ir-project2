In a report in The Lancet, a British medical journal, James R. Carlson and co-workers at the university, with researchers from the National Institutes of Health and Centocor Inc., of Malvern, Pa., described the new test as more rapid and economical than the currently used antibody tests, which determine whether a person has been infected by the virus.    The scientists assert that their test can show within 30 minutes whether the antibody is present, compared with currently used tests, which usually take two to four hours. The group said it believes its test can be produced for &quot;well under&quot; the current $1 to $6 cost. Mr. Carlson, a professor of pathology and medicine at the University of California here, said the new test can be performed in remote areas without laboratory facilities, making it suitable for use in Africa, where the virus is believed to have sickened and killed large and uncounted numbers of victims. He asserted the test is 99% accurate in diagnosing AIDS viral infection.    The group said field testing began last summer in Africa and that tests are continuing.    Separately, Niels C. Pedersen of the university's School of Veterinary Medicine said in a report in the journal Science that he and co-workers isolated a virus in cats, which he named FTLV (or feline T-lymphotropic Lentivirus), that is distinct from both the human AIDS virus and from other cat ailments like feline Leukemia virus (or FELV). The researchers said they noted that cats infected with FTLV exhibited symptoms strikingly like those of humans with acquired immune deficiency syndrome, including diarrhea, wasting, and neurological disorders.    This contrasts with the simian AIDS virus which can cause infection, but not disease as does human AIDS. Thus, the researchers believe the new cat virus might serve as a model for tests of AIDS therapies or vaccines. Tests on chimpanzees are now a standard for vaccine development, but the animals are rare and expensive, commanding a $50,000 fee for one animal. In addition, chimpanzee tests are an inexact yardstick because the animals never develop AIDS.    AIDS ravages the immune system, leaving its victims vulnerable to death by a variety of rare infections and cancers. It is spread by sexual contact, contaminated blood and shared needles. More than 30,000 cases of the disease have been diagnosed in the U.S. since 1981, and half of those people have died so far. </TEXT></DOC>
