Vernon Sandamp;L was a small-town thrift doing that small-townbusiness 10 miles below the Oklahoma border. There was hardly asafer, more plain-vanilla business.   In the late 1970s, high interest rates sapped the profitabilityout of Sandamp;Ls, though. Congress deregulated the industry, looseningthe restraints on what rates Sandamp;Ls could pay depositors and openingup new money-making services.   Dixon bought Vernon in 1982, moved its headquarters to Dallasand offered high rates that attracted depositors from across thecountry. The deposits were guaranteed by the FSLIC up to $100,000,and millions of dollars flew in. Vernon grew a staggering 1600percent in less than four years _ even though Sandamp;Ls are prohibitedfrom growing more than 25 percent per year.   With all those deposits, Vernon went on a lending binge. Newrules allowed Sandamp;Ls into commercial developments. The changes alsoallowed loans on projects with little capital behind them and nodown payments. Qualifying for loans was a snap if you knew theright people and were willing to pay Vernon's heftier fees.   ``The officers of Vernon conducted the real estate lendingfunction of Vernon in a way calculated to create as much loan-feeincome as possible, without particular regard to use of soundlending practices,'' former Vernon chief lending officer Jim Wrightsaid in an affidavit.   New rules also allowed Vernon and other Sandamp;Ls to become a partnerin deals by making direct investments _ a risky venture.   ``Direct investment is heads, they win; tails, the FSLICloses,'' said FHLBB member Roger Martin.   The FSLIC, of course, usually lost.   At the high-flying Sandamp;Ls, there were tales of developers liningup in bank lobbies to ``do deals.'' Ed McBirney, then chairman ofSunbelt Savings, which was known as ``Gunbelt Savings,'' conductedbusiness at a local restaurant.   Western Savings Association grew 5700 percent under itschairman, Jarrett Woods, who, federal regulators say, took $3million in salary and bonuses while his Sandamp;L plunged into the red.   As the frenzied lending continued and depositors' interestearnings had to be paid, bank executives raised the interest ratesoffered even higher so more money would come in, and dove into evenriskier ventures hoping for a big payoff.   The cycle has been likened to a pyramid scheme, backed by theinsurance of the government.   ``Many of these high fliers used their Sandamp;Ls as private piggybanks,'' the General Accounting Office reported.   Officials also charge that Sandamp;L executives fudged their requiredfilings with regulators to make thrifts look healthier. At the endof 1986, Vernon reported a positive net worth of $17 million, butregulators say it actually was negative $350 million. Ninety-sixpercent of its loans were overdue.   The FHLBB estimates the cost of cleaning up Texas is $15billion. The national total grows about $1 billion a month,according to government projections. Paying off depositors willcost twice what the Reagan administration has spent on ``StarWars,'' officials say, at least $40 billion and perhaps $100billion.   An FBI task force, which now occupies an entire floor of afederal building here, has subpoenaed records from 290 individuals.So far, 17 Sandamp;L officials have been charged; Collins expects moreindictments this fall.   ``When you commit armed robbery at a bank, alarms go off, thepolice come and sometimes there's a chase,'' Collins said.   ``When you commit bank fraud, nothing happens. There's not muchof immediate consequence.''</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Scott McCartney is the AP Southwest regionalreporter, based in Dallas.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Sunday Aug. 21</NOTE></DOC>
