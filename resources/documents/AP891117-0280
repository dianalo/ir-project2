There was no indication from the source, who spoke only oncondition of anonymity, whether the committee had decided on anindividual to investigate Sens. Alan Cranston, D-Calif.; DennisDeConcini, D-Ariz; John Glenn, D-Ohio; John McCain, R-Ariz. andDonald Riegle, D-Mich.   The New York Times said in Friday editions the committee hadchosen prominent Washington lawyer Robert S. Bennett for the job,and also for another investigating Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., inan unrelated case. Bennett was hired earlier this year for yet athird committee investigation.   Bennett was away from home for the evening.   The five senators in the Sandamp;L case intervened with bankingregulators examining Lincoln Savings and Loan of Irvine, Calif.,whose chairman, Charles H. Keating, gave the senators direct andindirect campaign contributions in the mid-1980s.   A standing Senate order says that Ethics Committeeinvestigations ``shall be conducted by outside counsel ... unlessthe select committee determines not to use outside counsel.''   The congressional watchdog Common Cause had urged the outsidecounsel so that the results of the inquiry would be credible andaccepted by the public.   Earlier this year, the House ethics committee hired an outsidecounsel to press its case against then-speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas.That lawyer, Richard Phelan of Chicago, became the focal point ofWright's counter-attack to try to save his job. Wright resigned inJune.   Over the summer, the Senate panel appointed Bennett to look intoaccusations that Sen. David Durenberger, R-Minn., laundered$100,000 in campaign contributions through a book contract,according to a Durenberger announcement in August.   First word of the decision to seek a counsel Thursday came fromCBS News.   Meanwhile, Cranston told the Ethics Committee Thursday heviolated no laws, ethical standards or Senate rules in meeting withfederal regulators on behalf of Lincoln.   ``The committee should determine that no further action ... iswarranted,'' the Senate Democratic whip said in a formal response,prepared by his attorney, to a month-old inquiry by the ethicscommittee.   In an accompanying letter to its chairman and vice chairman,Cranston said his inquiries to the Federal Home Loan Bank Boardabout Lincoln were ``nothing more and nothing less'' than what hehas done for other constituents ``with credible complaints abouttheir treatment by a federal agency.''   Cranston is the third of five senators to respond to the ethicspanel's inquiry. The five received a total of $1.3 million incontributions to their campaigns and other political causes fromKeating.   Cranston's spokesman, Murray Flander, said he had no furthercomment on the committee's Thursday decision. ``We have nofirst-hand knowledge of it,'' Flander said.   Telephones for spokesmen for Riegle were not answered.   McCain said in a statement, ``I think the appointment is apositive step, and I am confident that an investigation willvidictae my repeated statements that I never absued my office nortook actions that were improper.''   DeConcini issued a statement saying, ``I welcome anything thatwill establish the facts and I will cooperate fully.''   Glenn's aide Dale Butland said in Columbus, Ohio, ``The senatorhas not been notified of this.''   Cranston was among four senators who met with then Bank BoardChairman Edwin Gray on April 2, 1987, and five senators who met aweek later with regional officials from the board's San Franciscooffice about Lincoln.   Cranston also phoned Gray's successor, M. Danny Wall, lastspring endorsing Keating's failed attempt to sell Lincoln beforeregulators obtained a court order to seize it.   The ethics panel was asked last month by Common Cause toinitiate the inquiry after mid-level Sandamp;L regulators told the HouseBanking Committee their efforts to shut Lincoln down in early 1987were thwarted by Keating's political influence.   Regulators seized control of Lincoln only last April. Theyestimate taxpayers will have to cover between $2 billion and $2.5billion in federally insured deposits the thrift lost in thebiggest Sandamp;L failure in history and have filed a $1.1 billion fraudand racketeering suit against Keating and his associates.   In addition, hundreds of the 22,000 bondholders who boughthigh-risk debentures in Lincoln's holding Co., American ContinentalCorp. of Phoenix, through Lincoln branches have sued Keating afterlosing an estimated $200 million.   Cranston received $35,000 in direct campaign gifts from Keatingand his associates. Keating also contributed another $850,000 toCalifornia voter registration campaigns headed by Cranston's son.And Cranston was instrumental in raising nearly $89,000 throughKeating for the California Democratic Party.   ``I am not responsible for loss of taxpayer funds through adelay in shutting down Lincoln or the losses of innocent Californiabond investors,'' Cranston said in his letter to Sens. HowellHeflin, D-Ala., and Warren B. Rudman, R-N.H., the chairman and vicechairman of the ethics panel.   ``I never attempted to derail any investigation of wrongdoing atLincoln, nor did I ever suggest to Chairman Gray, Chairman Wall orany other official that an investigation be delayed,'' Cranstonsaid.   DeConcini and Riegle have sent similar responses to the ethicspanel. Glenn and McCain have not yet filed formal responses buthave denied any wrongdoing.   Cranston said he attended the April 2 meeting with Gray becauseKeating had told him Lincoln was being treated unfairly by the bankboard in a yearlong examination.   Bolstering Keating's complaint, Cranston said, were statementsby Lincoln's auditor and Alan Greenspan, now chairman of theFederal Reserve Board but then a private consultant retained byKeating, that the thrift and its investments were sound.</TEXT></DOC>
