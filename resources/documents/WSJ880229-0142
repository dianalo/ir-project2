One possible result of their work, the companies said, would be the operation of automobiles through a so-called local area network. Such networks are used to link computers in offices.    The companies plan to demonstrate an auto controlled by such a fiber-optic network at the Hanover, West Germany, trade fair April 20. Codenoll markets fiber-optic networks, while Hoechst, a chemicals and pharmaceuticals giant, developed the optical fibers.    The companies said connections such as those for headlamps and electric trunk locks can be made with a few meters of plastic optical fiber, rather than the thousands of feet of copper wire currently required. Optical fiber has less volume and weight and greater reliability, they said. </TEXT></DOC>
