The last time Poland's leader, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, tried to inject an entrepreneurial spirit into Poland's lagging economy, he had just placed the country under martial law. This time, nearly six years later, he has decided to hold a national referendum before going ahead.    Prime Minister Zbigniew Messner announced in parliament Saturday that Polish voters would be asked on Nov. 29 to determine the &quot;degree and rate&quot; of the reform. Such a referendum, first alluded to by Gen. Jaruzelski in an interview with The Wall Street Journal in July, appears to be without precedent in a Communist country. Poland hasn't held a national referendum of any kind since 1946.    The precise wording of the referendum hasn't been determined. Some Poles speculated over the weekend that it may be a proposition so general -- about the desirability of a healthy economy, for example -- that few would reject it. The proposition isn't likely to raise directly the issue of sharp price increases that will be essential to any reform drive.    One Pole, speaking of &quot;bread and circuses,&quot; suggested that the referendum would provide more &quot;entertainment&quot; to a public facing the prospect of a decline in the supply of &quot;bread.&quot;    Outlining the reform measures, Mr. Messner took pains to allay the kind of political upheaval Polish governments have endured after price increases in the past. But he made it clear that Poland, already beset by chronic shortages, faces further belt-tightening.    As has been the case in many other East bloc countries, the contemplated changes broadly follow those put forward by the Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev. They include a deep cut in the number of central-government ministries and the dismissal of as many as 3,500 civil servants and about 90 top officials. The aim will be to give enterprise managers greater control, allowing supply and demand to supplant part of the planned economy.    The plans also call for the issuance of bonds by companies and the emergence of a capital market. The banking system is already set to be decentralized early next year. The measures also will make it simpler for individuals to set up private businesses and to trade with foreign countries.    The package, intended to be put into place between 1988 and 1990, is likely to please overseas creditors, who are owed more than $35 billion by Poland. Foreshadowing the reforms, the World Bank said in a report on the country in July that many of the bank's &quot;criticisms of the economic system will shortly become outdated.&quot;    Yet the Poles have expressed many of the same principles before without implementing them. The bank points out in its report that the investment structure already laid out in the state's 1986-1990 plan perpetuates market imbalances.    One-fifth of industry, for example, has been excluded from past reforms by being classified as &quot;enterprises of national interest.&quot; These include energy-producers whose activities strongly affect every facet of the economy. Under the new reforms, the coal and power industries will remain under centralized direction. </TEXT></DOC>
