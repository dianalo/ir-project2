Wassersug </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> PHA </IN><TEXT>   In the past, most of us correctly assumed that health came to us naturally. When an occasional medicine show came to town, we could, at our own discretion, either listen to the sales pitch of the snakeoil vendor or walk away from him. Today this is impossible.    The airwaves, the printed page and public lectures bombard us constantly with apprehensions and fears about our well-being. Almost everywhere you turn, you find the once-conservative medical profession creating demands and huckstering claims that were, only so recently, not only unethical but unthinkable.    Hospitals, for example, in their frantic search for more &quot;customers,&quot; are operating &quot;wellness clinics,&quot; &quot;stress-management courses&quot; and &quot;hypertension screenings,&quot; in addition to the more ordinary clinics for diabetes, glaucoma, TMJ, premenstrual stress, cholesterol, Pap smears, migraines, or almost any other medical disorder or test that has captured -- or may capture -- the attention of the public.    This is not without cost, both psychological and monetary. Almost everything that is done to promote the public awareness of an ailment induces a concomitant rise in anxiety -- from AIDS to dental plaque. And there is no question that the present &quot;advertising&quot; campaign that cautions the public to fight placque sells more toothpastes and mouthwashes and may even promote more visits to periodontists.    Consider our current fear of high cholesterol. Not only has the health industry exaggerated its theoretical dangers, but alerting the public about the risks of cholesterol seems to have become a matter of public health policy. Even though the precise role of cholesterol in causing atherosclerosis is still being debated in scientific circles, the health industry continues to fuel the anxieties of the public. It is just possible these fears may force some number of &quot;high risk&quot; individuals to mend their ways. But there is no question that these fears do sell more fiber foods, more unsaturated spreads, some fish-oil capsules, a multitude of costly medicines and the need for more and more laboratory tests. When septuagenarians and octogenarians scan the labels on food products to see how much cholesterol they contain, it's easy to see how far this nonsense has gone.    This is not to imply that every cholesterol test is a waste of money, or that Pap smears are a needless extravagance, or that mammograms are not important. There are many tests and procedures that are advisable and worthwhile. What disturbs me is the hysterical component to all this testing and treating. For example, not even the most ardent proponents of the cholesterol theory have referred to cholesterol as a &quot;disease.&quot; Cholesterol has been identified only as a &quot;risk factor,&quot; yet a book with the title &quot;The 8-Week Cure for Cholesterol&quot; enjoys extraordinarily wide sales. Even young children are inculcated with cholesterol phobias and other worrisome dietary concerns. Fear and anxiety, it seems, have replaced calm, rational judgment.    In my 40-odd years of medical practice I learned that many (or perhaps even most) people can go through life and achieve a vibrant, old age with only a rare visit to a doctor and without ever getting a &quot;checkup.&quot; Often, then, the first encounter with the doctor may have been when the patient was 75 or 80. This is not to say that checkups have no merit; some conditions -- cancer for example -- may show no symptoms when they are at their most treatable stage. But I learned that for many individuals health was an attribute of some endowed or inherited characteristics. I discovered that, for some, better-than-average longevity could be achieved even when they smoked, had hypertension or a cluster of other &quot;risk factors.&quot; Some people, it seems, can drive safely even if their cars have lousy brakes.    Today, almost all of us are brainwashed to believe that disability and even death lurk behind every step we take, every morsel of food, and that salvation comes only by the strictest attention to every publicized health advisory. (In a recent study of 2,000 elderly people in Dunedin, Fla., researchers found some who were taking 15 or more vitamin products a day!)    While there is some virtue to all the &quot;health&quot; lectures and &quot;free&quot; tests, I can't shake the uneasy feeling that the bloodpressure clinic at the supermarket or shopping center may be more for pecuniary than salutary gain. Does every person need to have his blood pressure or cholesterol checked, including infants and young children? Should adolescents be advised to adhere to a low-fat, low-salt diet and never enjoy a hot dog or ice-cream cone? Must the pursuit of fitness and health be allowed to become a national obsession, an irrational response to manipulation by the health industry?    I think not. We must learn to question the health news that we read in the press or observe on our TV screens. We must stop these efforts to make us sick. We must learn again how to enjoy life.    ---   Dr. Wassersug, a retired internist, writes frequently on health subjects. </TEXT></DOC>
