These management activities may include timber harvest, road constructionand reconstruction, insect and disease management, and road management.Management activities under consideration would occur in an area encompassingapproximately 8,300 acres of multi-ownership lands in the Sleeping Childdrainage. Of this total, approximately 7,400 acres are National ForestSystem lands. Proposed activities are confined to an area south and eastof Sleeping Child Hot Springs and west of the Sleeping Child Burn in allor parts of Sections 12-14, 23, and 24, T.4N., R.20W.; Sections 7, 8, 17-21,28-30, 32-35, T.4N., R.19W.; and Sections 1-5, 10-12, T.3N., R.19W.Included in the assessment area is the entire Sleeping Child Creek drainageabove Sleeping Child Hot Springs. Starting at the resort, the area boundaryruns east to Bald Top Mountain, Two Bear Meadows and Coyote Meadows; southeastto Mosquito Meadows; southwest to Crystal Point; northwest to White StallionCamp and Blacktail Point; and northeast to Sleeping Child Hot Springs.The legal description for the area is Sections 12, 13, 24, T.4N., R.20W.;Sections 7, 8, 9, 13-30, 32-36, T.4N., R.19W.; Sections 1-5, 12, T.3N.,R.19W.; Sections 18-21, 27-35, T.4N., R.18W.; and Sections 2-11, 16, 17,18, T.3N., R.18W., P.M.M. The land is in National Forest ownership exceptSections 1, 3, and 11, T.3N., R.19W., which belongs to Plum Creek TimberCompany.Scoping has already been utilized for the development of an environmentalassessment. Public notice was initiated by mailing an announcement to alist of potentially affected individuals and organizations on March 30,1984. Numerous newspaper articles have been printed concerning the analysisprocess. An environmental assessment was approved on October 31, 1985.Because additional issues were recognized during the public participationprocess, an addendum to the environmental assessment was compiled. Thisdocument was completed under the guidance of the Forest Plan and approvedin May, 1988. Approximately 30 copies of both documents were given to personsor groups indicating interest in the analysis. In June, 1988, a field tripwas conducted with concerned publics in order to solicit comments and information.Several written responses to the assessments have been received.The issues identified to date in the environmental analysis process forthe assessment include:1. Will the cost of timber management and road construction exceed benefits?2. What effect will stream sedimentation have on fish spawning habitat?3. Will water quality be degraded? Will low-flow quantities be changed?4. How will road construction and timber harvest affect big game habitatand security?5. What impacts will this proposal have on job and income stability inthe local forest products industry?6. Can timber be harvested without irreversible damage to soil, slope,or watershed conditions?7. What will be the effects from planned timber cutting on private landsin the area?8. What will be the effects on non-game wildlife species?The alternatives disclosed in the Addendum to the Environmental Assessmentwill also be considered in the environmental impact statement. These alternativesincluded a ``no action'' alternative and four action alternatives whichrange from harvesting about 6 million board feet of timber using existingroads to about 15 million board feet harvested with 14 miles of new roads.Additional alternatives will be considered when scoping for the environmentalimpact statement is completed.A Decision Notice and Findings documenting the need for an environmentalimpact statement was signed on August 25, 1988. The rationale was: (1)Scoping indicated that the effects on the quality of the human environment,including elk habitat, water quality and fisheries, caused by road constructionand timber harvest, was likely to be highly controversial; (2) the actionmight be related to other existing and proposed actions that together couldhave cumulatively significant impacts, particularly on elk security andhabitat effectiveness; (3) the potential exists to concentrate roadingand harvest activities on moist sites with many riparian areas; and (4)a portion of the assessment area is in the Sleeping Child roadless areanumber X1-074.Public participation will be important during the analysis for the environmentalimpact statement. The first point of public participation is during thescoping process (40 CFR 1501.7). The Forest Service is seeking informationand comments from Federal, State, local agencies, and other individualsor organizations who may be interested in or affected by the proposed action.This input will be used in preparation of the draft environmental impactstatement. The scoping and analysis process includes:1. Identification of potential issues.2. Identification of issues to be analyzed in depth.3. Elimination of insignificant issues or those which have been coveredby a relevant previous environmental analysis.4. Identification of alternatives in addition to those identified in theenvironmental assessment.5. Identification of potential environmental effects of the alternatives(i.e., direct, indirect, cumulative effects, and connected actions).6. Determination of potential cooperating agencies and task assignments.Additional comments or questions are being solicited at this time. Commentsreceived by November 14, 1988 will be considered in the preparation ofthe draft environmental impact statement.The draft environmental impact statement (DEIS) is expected to be filedwith the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and available for publicreview in January, 1989. At that time, the EPA will publish a notice ofavailability of the DEIS in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4>The comment period on the draft environmental impact statement will be45 days from the date the EPA's notice of availability appears in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4> It is very important those interested in themanagement of the White Stallion area participate at that time. To be mosthelpful, comments on the DEIS should be as specific as possible and mayaddress the adequacy or the merits of the alternatives discussed (40 CFR1503.3). In addition, Federal court decisions have established that reviewersof the draft EIS's must structure their participation in the environmentalreview of the proposal so it is meaningful and alerts an agency to thereviewers' position and contentions (<T3>Vermont Yankee Nulcear Power Corp. v. NRDC,</T3> 435 U.S. 519, 553(1978)), and environmental objections that could have been raised at thedraft stage may be waived if not raised until after completion of the finalenvironmental impact statement (<T3>Wisconsin Heritages, Inc. v. Harris,</T3> 490 F. Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D.Wis. 1980)). The reason for this is to ensure that substantive commentsand objections are made available to the Forest Service at a time whenit can meaningfully consider them, and respond to them in the final EIS.After the comment period ends on the DEIS, the comments will be analyzedand considered by the Forest Service in preparing the final environmentalimpact statement (FEIS). The FEIS is scheduled to be completed by April,1989. In the FEIS, the Forest Service is required to respond to the commentsreceived (40 CFR 1503.4). The responsible official will consider the commentsand responses; environmental consequences discussed in the FEIS; and applicablelaws, regulations, and policies in making a decision regarding this proposal.The responsible official will document the decision and reasons for thedecision in the Record of Decision. The decision will be subject to reviewunder applicable Forest Service regulations.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: October 7, 1988. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">David M.
