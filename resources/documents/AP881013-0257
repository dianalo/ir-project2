Q: Mr. Vice President, you have flatly ruled out any change insocial security benefits, even for the wealthy. Now, can you standhere tonight and look a whole generation of 18 to 34 year olds inthe eye, the very people who are going to have to be financing thatretirement, and tell them that they should be financing theretirement of people like yourself, like Governor Dukakis, or forthat matter, people such as ourselves here on this panel.   Bush: More so you than me. But --   Q: -- We could argue about that.   Bush: -- No, but, you've got to go back to what Social Securitywas when it was created. It wasn't created as a welfare program, itwasn't created -- it was created as a whole retirement or healthsupplement to retirement program. It wasn't created as a welfareprogram. So here's what's happened. We came into office and theSocial Security Trust Fund was in great jeopardy. And the Presidenttook the leadership, working with the Democrats and the Republicansin Congress. Some tough calls were made and the Social SecurityTrust Fund was put back into sound, solvent condition.   So I don't want to fool around with it. And there's several --there's a good political reason, because it's just about this timeof year that the Democrats start saying: ``The Republicans aregoing to take away your Social Security.'' It always works thatway. I've seen it in precinct politics in Texas, and I've seen itat the national level.   We have made the Social Security Trust Fund sound, and it isgoing to be operating at surpluses. And I don't want the liberalDemocratic Congress to spend out of that Social Security Trust Fundor go and take the money out for some other purpose. I don't wantthat. And I will not go in there and suggest changes in SocialSecurity. I learned that the hard way.   And the Governor and I both supported slipping the COLAs for oneyear; he supported it at the National Governor's Conference, and Isupported it in breaking a tie in a major compromise package. Andwe got assailed by the Democrats in the election over that. And Iam going to keep that Social Security Trust Fund sound and keep ourcommitment to the elderly. And maybe down the line, maybe when youget two decades or one into the next century, you're going to haveto take another look at it, but not now. We do not have to do it.Keep the trust with the older men and women of this country.   Moderator: Governor, you have one minute, sir.   Dukakis: Andrea, I don't know which George Bush I'm listeningto. George Bush, a few years ago, said that Social Security wasbasically a welfare system. And in 1985 he flew back from the WestCoast to cut that COLA. I voted against that at the NationalGovernor's Association. We won a majority; we didn't win thetwo-thirds that was necessary in order to pass that resolution,George, but everybody knew what we were doing, and I've opposedthat.   The reason that we raised concerns not just in election years,but every year, is because Republicans, once they're elected, go inthere and start cutting. You did it in 1985. The administrationtried to do it repeatedly, repeatedly in '81, '82, and I'm sureyou'll try to do it again because there's no way that you canfinance what you want to spend, there's no way you can pay for thatfive-year, $40 billion tax cut for the rich and still buy all thoseweapon systems you want to buy, unless you raid the Social SecurityTrust Fund.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
