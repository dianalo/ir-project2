Macmillan already is the subject of a $1.9 billion bid fromRobert M. Bass Group Inc., a Texas-based investment group.   In a letter to Macmillan, Maxwell said he would drop his$80-a-share tender offer if Macmillan would sell him theinformation company, which Macmillan proposed to separate from itspublishing business in a corporate restructuring.   Maxwell said his Maxwell Communications Corp. PLC would bewilling to pay ``not less than $1.1 billion'' in cash for theinformation business, noting that Macmillan's investment bankershad valued it at ``a range of $800 million to slightly in excess of$1 billion.''   In the letter, Maxwell also told Macmillan Chairman Edward P.Evans he was ``willing to explore other forms of transactions withyou'' that would allow current shareholders to continue to hold asignificant stake in the company.   Maxwell also reitereated he wanted to retain Macmillanmanagement.   Macmillan declined to comment on Maxwell's proposals.   On Wall Street, the price of Macmillan stock rose $1.50 a shareto $83.25, indicating investors expected the bidding to escalate.   ``Some people suggested Maxwell isn't serious, but by launchinga tender offer at $80 a share on Monday, we see he is serious,''said Bert Boksen, who follows the publishing business for thebrokerage Raymond James andamp; Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla.   But Boksen said by making the alternate suggestion that he besold the information assets, Maxwell ``identified the piece he ismost interested in.''   ``I think Macmillan is backed up against the wall and will tryto find a white knight,'' he said. He said Macmillan could be worth$90 a share.   The overture from Maxwell came only three days before ascheduled court hearing in Delaware on whether Macmillan should beallowed to proceed with its proposed restructuring.   The restructuring, announced in late May, would split thecompany into separate publishing and information services concernsand pay shareholders a special dividend of $52.35 a share in cash.   That plan was advanced after the Bass Group proposed to pay $64a share for the Macmillan stock it did not already own. The BassGroup subsequently sweetened its offer twice, and launched its owntender offer for Macmillan at $75 a share.   The Bass Group won an order from Delaware Chancery Courtblocking Macmillan from proceeding with its restructuring.Macmillan appealed the decision to Delaware Supreme Court, whichscheduled a hearing for Monday.   Maxwell disclosed his interest in Macmillan in mid-July, sayinghe would be interested in paying $80 a share for its 25.9 millionshares in a friendly transaction.   A Maxwell spokesman said Friday that the tender offer at thatprice would commence on Monday. It is contingent on dropping therestructuring plan, among other things, but Maxwell said it is notconditioned upon obtaining necessary financing.   Late last month, the Macmillan board rejected the $75 a shareoffer from Bass as inadequate, but took no position on the Maxwellproposal.   Macmillan spokesman David Jackson refused Friday to comment onwhether the board has since met to discuss the Maxwell proposal, oranything else.   Maxwell has vowed to make Maxwell Communications one of theworld's biggest media and communications businesses. Through thatcompany and Pergamon Press, Maxwell controls the Mirror Group ofnewspapers in Great Britain, is one of America's largest printersof magazines and catlogues and has extensive holdings in publishingacademic and scientific journals.</TEXT></DOC>
