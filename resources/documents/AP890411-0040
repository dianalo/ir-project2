(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The man described by prosecutors as one ofthe nation's most powerful crime bosses pleaded guilty for thefirst time and cried before a federal judge as he admitted toextortion and racketeering.   Anthony ``Fat Tony'' Salerno, the 78-year-old reputed formerboss of the Genovese crime family, told the judge Monday he wasguilty of trying to wrest control of a Morris County sand-pitbusiness and trying to extort $500,000 from its owner, AndrewGiordano.   Salerno already is serving a 100-year sentence for his 1986conviction as a mob boss in the New York trial of the Mafia'sruling ``Commission.''   Salerno could be sentenced to an additional five years in prisonand fined up to $10,000 in the New Jersey case.   U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito Jr. said the New Jersey chargeswere warranted despite Salerno's long prison sentence.   ``The purpose of this indictment was not to increase hissentence, but to demonstrate to the citizens of New Jersey thedangers posed by La Cosa Nostra, and the degree to which thehighest levels of the Mafia have infiltrated and affected theirlives,'' Alito said.   Salerno's attorney, John Jacobs, said the guilty pleas did notmean Salerno participated in the offenses.   ``It was an accommodation to avoid trial,'' said Jacobs, whopointed out that a medical condition caused by a 1981 strokeaffects Salerno's emotional state and caused him to cry at Monday'shearing.   Special U.S. Attorney Jeffrey A. Bronster said the reputed crimeboss's plea shows he was involved in the allegations.   ``He has pleaded guilty to the charges, I'd say that's admittinghis guilt,'' Bronster said.   The gravelly voiced Salerno walked into the courtroom with theaid of a cane.   He repeatedly answered ``Yes'' when Judge John W. Bissell askedhim if he understood the charges and wished to plead guilty. Hecupped his hands over his face and cried several times.</TEXT></DOC>
