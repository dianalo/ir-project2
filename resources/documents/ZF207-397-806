 Security, where it existed, was a locked file cabinet or areadily distracted guard.andM;As a threat to data security, such detective-novel antics are not the onlycauses worry in this network era.andP;  For many large banks, insurance companiesand multinationals, data protection is becoming as much a function of theencryptographer's key as the security guard.andM;Just ask Hal Tipton.andP;  As manager of information security at rockwellInternational Corp. of Seal Beach, Calif., Tipton recently toured theaerospace concern's offices around the country to raise securityconciousness.andP;  &quot;We've had quite a few hacking incidents and viruses,&quot; hesays.andP;  &quot;They've all been benign so far, but the message is clear.andP;  Benigntoday, malignant tomorrow.&quot;andM;That same message has spread to others thanks to well-publicized viruses atthe U.S.andP;  Department of Defense's ARPANET and security breaches at majorcorporations.andP;  As distributed processing and applications such as electronicmail grow, companies are probing their vulnerability to electronic breaches.andO;How to limit such breaches is a question that increasingly concerns Tiptonand others like him.andM;One solution getting a second look is data encryption.andP;  Widely criticized inthe past as cumbersome and expensive, the security device has lately seensome advancements that are making some users reconsider it.andP;  Perhaps thebiggest publicity boost was the decision by worm weary Internet to offerencryption services for the first time in the nationwide research network'shistory.andM;But even those old time users of encryption are noticing a difference.andP;  &quot;Asfar as the general use of encryption, my observation is that it's up,&quot; saysBern Flaherty, manager of corporate security for Citicorp, in New York City.andO;In certain instances, such as when communicating with the Federal ReserveBank, Citicorp has no choice but to encrypt.andM;Precautions also are taken with executives' foreign travel itineraries andwith electronic discussions of pending deals.andP;  In more routinecommunications, such as Citicorp's 25,000-user electronic mail system,encryption remains an option.andM;While encouraging employees to lock offices, Flaherty and others in hisprofession must also cope with information age burglars.andP;  For instance, thereis plenty of software available that monitors keystrokes and routines thatcan trap user passwords and system access codes.andP;  Yet, all too frequently,information flows without safeguards.andM;&quot;Guys will lock up their file cabinets and doors, but they'll let informationflow [unguarded] over microwave or telephone lines,&quot; says Lewis Morris,president of security products vendor Cylink Corp. of Sunnyvale, Calid.andP;  &quot;Wedon't get people buying encryption because they're thinking ahead.andP;  It'sbecause they've been stolen from.andP;  And it [encryption] is a growingbusiness.&quot;andM;Encryption, in its many types and uses, is becoming recognized as one of thebest ways to address such vulnerability.andP;  Internet, for example, this fallwill begin using software-based encryption, which is slower but considerablycheaper than the hardware encryption schemes commonly used for electronicfunds transfer.andP;  Internet users will be charged a $25 fee for a public keythat decodes their messages.andM;When encrypting, an algorithm converts the message or document into anunreadable jumble of characters and symbols.andP;  The key--essentially a stringof digital information--allows users to encode or decode a message.andP;  To date,key management has been the most complex and costly part of encryption.andP;  Butnewer electronic methods are simplifying the process.andM;Not always a BargainandM;Most encryption users will not get the same bargain as those on Internet.andP;  AtRockwell, Tipton estimates that encryption costs his company $1,500 pernetwork node.andP;  Nonetheless, the company recommends that encryption be usedfor some sensitive information.andM;Very often, the first issue in a security review involves defining sensitivedata.andP;  Encryption addresses two basic but very different security needs.andP;  Thefirst and most obvious is keeping information secret.andP;  Companies may belegally responsible for even unauthorized disclosure of information, such asemployee medical records.andP;  Keeping data safe from competitors or foreigngovernments is a similar application.andP;  for example, John Brown, staffspecialist for computer security at Chevron Corp., reports that the oilcompany selectively uses encryption.andP;  One major use involves communication ofdrilling site information.andM;A second and in some cases more practical, application ensures that data havenot been altered.andP;  Financial institutions are less concerned with informationbeing discovered than they are with numbers being changed.andP;  What they seekare authentication schemes.andP;  Users of electronic data interchange also havesimilar priorities.andM;Private users aren't totally free from external review.andP;  The federalgovernment has long controlled the use and selection of encryption equipment.andM;The U.S.andP;  Department of State places this equipment in the same category asmunitions.andP;  Export licenses are required to ship outside U.S.andP;  borders.andO;Certain Communist nations are off-limits for any licenses.andP;  Conversely, someforeign nations place restrictions on what type of encryption equipmentU.S.-based companies can import.andP;  Licenses are generally easy to get forfinancial institutions with established encryption needs.andM;The U.S.andP;  government--the most practiced user of encryption--is frequently atthe helm of the technology.andP;  The heart of encryption is the cryptoalgorithm.andO;The most widely available algorithm is called data encryption standard (DES),which was developed in the early 1970s and gained widespread use (seesidebar).andM;A New ProgramandM;In 1988, the National Security Agency (NSA) stopped using DES for classifiedsecurity needs and began recommending that commercial companies also moveaway from DES to new encryption algorithms that the NSA controls.andP;  Since thealgorithms are secret, their export is severely limited.andP;  NSA calls itseffort the Commercial COMSEC Endorsement Program (CCEP).andM;DES is publicly known and is the basis of many products, even within thegovernment.andP;  The resons behind NSA's decision to move away from DES remainsthe subject of speculation.andP;  One rumor has it that DES has been broken andhence is no longer safe.andP;  Then there is the belief that because DES is intoits second decade, it's just good sense to move on to something new.andO;Finally, there are the popular conspiracy theories.andP;  The problem with DES,these theories go, isn't that it's weak, but too strong.andP;  They suggest theU.S.andP;  government wants commercial companies to use algorithms it knows how tobreak.andP;  The NSA would not grant an interview for this article.andM;So what does this mean for commercial users?andP;  So far not much, consideringthat the National Institute of Standards and Technology (formerly theNational Bureau of Standards) has continued to reaffirm DES for nonclassifieduse until at least January 1992.andP;  NSA early on positioned its new algorithmsas commercial alternatives to DES.andP;  But, in reality, use outside thegovernment has been limited.andP;  &quot;Originally, the NSA said there'd be a broadermarket,&quot; says Cylink's Morris.andP;  &quot;Now it's restricted.&quot;andM;Despite the availability of these new algorithms and rival security schemes,users show little or no disaffection for DES.andP;  &quot;We did not seriously consideranything else,&quot; says Stephen Kent, chairman of the Internet Activities BoardPrivacy Task Force.andM;&quot;People on my task force are not cryptographers.andP;  We know to take algorithmsas building blocks and form them into useful systems, but we do not know howto evaluate how good any algorithm is.&quot; Likewise, says a security officialwith the NIST, &quot;I see more and more users going to DES.&quot;andM;Users Keep the Standard AliveandM;There are several reasons behind the continued support.andP;  Nothing hasforcefully supplanted DES; there are plenty of products incorporating it; andcompanies feel that--even if data were disclosed--the use of U.S.andO;government-certified encryption standards offers certain legal protections.andM;This support holds despite the NSA actions and the constant rumors that theremay be a &quot;trap door&quot; in DES that compromises it.andP;  While some users privatelyfeel that the NSA or foreign governments may know how to break DES, they'renot too concerned.andP;  Even if the algoritm is compromised, it might take aCray-sized computer a month to break a message.andP;  Most commercial dataexchanges are time sensitive and quickly lose their value.andM;But if security isn't an issue, cost and complexity certainly are.andO;Traditionally, encryption incurred high overhead.andP;  For example, escortedcouriers would deliver keys on computer tape to the encryption equipmentusers.andP;  Senders and receivers generally share a key, allowing even one userto compromise a network.andP;  Also, the couriers had to be trusted and keysstored in secure boxes.andP;  For all the cost, there sometimes was little extrasafety.andP;  Recent spy incidents at the U.S.andP;  embassies in Moscow and Leningradshow that keys can be compromised and often for very little money.andP;  Oneexecutive places the rate for stolen commercial keys as low as $150.andM;But improvements in key management are beginning to make encryption cheaperand easier to handle.andP;  Notable among them is public key technology, whichuses electronic distribution methods.andP;  Each user has two keys, one privateand one public.andP;  Although the public key bears a specific mathematicalrelationship to the private key, it requires no security precautions.andO;Indeed, the public key usually is published in a common electronic directory,such as those found on electronic mail system.andP;  The user then decodes themessage with his private key.andM;Although the NSA is not believed to use public key technology, manycommercial users do.andP;  Two of the better known systems are RSA from RSA DataSecurity Inc. of Redwood City, Calif., and SEEK from Cylink.andM;Networked Software ProtectionandM;One RSA product is the RSA Digital Signature, an authentication tool thatverifies the originator and the integrity of the transmitted data.andP;  In thiscase, the messages may not be hidden, but the recipient will know if they'vebeen tampered with.andM;An outgrowth of this type of security product is used to protect networkedsoftware.andP;  One user applying the technology in this manner is the U.S.andO;Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics, which has 1,200 networkedPCs.andM;&quot;W aren't involved too much in the sending around of secret messages,&quot; saysRichard Heddinger, a computer scientist at the Labor Bureau's Division ofCommunications and Computer Technology.andP;  Rather, they want to ensure thatnone of their software has been hit by viruses.andP;  &quot;We have networked software,and to give us the feeling of confidence that nothing has disturbed it, weput on the Digital Signature,&quot; he adds.andM;Most users cannot cost justify, nor do they need, the millions of dollarsworth of encryption equipment that a Citicorp has, for example.andP;  However,many companies will start to increase the use of the technology in differentforms.andP;  For example, Lotus Development Corp. recently embedded RSA technologyin its Notes workgroup software.andM;&quot;Connectivity is the buzzword of the day,&quot; says Rockwell's Tipton.andP;  Securityno longer means locking up the mainframe; terminal users no longer arerestricted to userging a single data base field at a time.andP;  Today, users canchange whole files at a time and from a distance.andP;  &quot;We have 16,000microcomputers around the country,&quot; he adds.andP;  &quot;These are 16,000 computingcenters.andP;  I'm telling them that they must take some of the responsibility.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
