Contracts for June delivery of West Texas Intermediate, thebenchmark U.S. crude, settled at $18.60 per barrel, up 20 centsfrom Monday's close on the New York Mercantile Exchange.   Among May contracts for refined products, wholesale unleadedgasoline closed at 52.42 cents per gallon, up 0.37 cent, whilewholesale heating oil settled 0.83 cent higher, at 52.04 cents pergallon.   The move up stemmed mainly from technical factors, according toChris McCormack, an analyst at the Drexel Burham Lambert Inc.securities firm.   He said trading was apathetic until the crude contract driftedhigher than the market expected, at which point buyers stepped in.   Traders also nervously were watching meetings in Vienna,Austria, between officials of the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries and rival producers over ways of tighteningworld supplies to boost prices.   Buying increased somewhat after word hit the market that sevenindependent oil-producing nations had decided to offer OPEC a 5percent cut in their oil exports as a gesture of support, McCormacksaid.   A 5 percent cut for all independent producers would amount to areduction in exports of roughly 200,000 barrels a day.   Production cuts, if implemented, would be expected to push upoil prices, at least temporarily, by bringing supplies closer inline with demand.   The two sides consisted of OPEC's price monitoring committee,comprised of the oil ministers of Saudi Arabia, Indonesia,Venezuela, Nigeria and Algeria, and representatives from non-cartelproducers Mexico, Colombia, Egypt, Angola, Oman, Malaysia, Bruneiand China.   The price committee was to present the proposal to the full,13-member OPEC at a meeting Thursday in Vienna.</TEXT></DOC>
