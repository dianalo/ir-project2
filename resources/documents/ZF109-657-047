Templeton, M.D., chairmanof diagnostic radiology at the University of Kansas Medical Center in KansasCity, Kan.andM;&quot;With US Sprint's fiber network and dial-up capability, medical imaging canbe transmitted virtually anywhere in the United States, allowing leadingradiologists in one locale to offer diagnostic services across city and stateboundaries.&quot;andM;The medical imaging application was developed by US Sprint's medical industrymarketing group in conjunction with several outside vendors, includingSiemans, MedLink, Medical Imaging Systems, Northern Telecom, Image TransferTechnology, and VideoTelecom.andM;US Sprint has signed SunHealth, a major healthcare alliance of non-profithospitals with headquarters in North Carolina, as its first major HANDScustomer.andP;  SunHealth provides more than 63,000 in-patient beds throughout thesoutheastern United States.andM;Key Executive: Richard Smith, president of National Markets for US Sprint.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
