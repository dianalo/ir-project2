Schmitt   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>02/01/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE B1</SO><IN>LAW AND LEGAL AFFAIRS (LAW)</IN><LP>   When Oracle Systems Corp. stock plunged 30% last Marchafter a surprisingly bad earnings report, lawyersrepresenting aggrieved shareholders swarmed into court,filing 14 lawsuits against the company within a week. Thenthe fight began -- over which of the throng would get thebiggest share of any resulting fee.   San Francisco federal Judge Vaughn Walker had a novelfree-market solution to the fracas: He auctioned off thelucrative post of lead counsel to the law firm offering tolitigate at the lowest cost to shareholders. The winner was aNew York firm that said it could do the job for one-thirdless than its nearest competitor.</LP><TEXT>   Needless to say, the losers are appalled and appealing,and it remains to be seen how many of his colleagues willadopt Judge Walker's methods. But the case underscores howplaintiffs' lawyers are increasingly on the defensive abouttheir fees. Besides auctioning litigation rights like assetsfrom failed savings and loans, judges are slashing fee awardsand cracking down on a kind of featherbedding that lawyershave long practiced in this field.   The increased scrutiny reflects several factors, lawyerson both sides say. In the latest fiscal year, courts wereflooded with more securities-law class-action suits than inany of the previous 20 years, apparently reflecting Sandamp;L andbank problems. The attention also reflects a growing tendencyof judges to consider the economic costs and benefits oftheir decisions.   &quot;There is tremendous fear on behalf of judges that theywill be seen as giving unjustified windfalls to plaintiffattorneys,&quot; says John Coffee, a Columbia University lawprofessor.   Moreover, the changes come at a time when some judges andacademicians appear to be increasingly questioning the meritsof such litigation. In a recent study of shareholder suitssince the late 1960s, Roberta Romano, a Yale Law Schoolprofessor, found that plaintiff attorneys ended up with cashmuch more frequently than the people they represented, andthat in several instances, attorneys got paid (usually by thedefendant as part of a settlement) and the shareholders gotnothing.   A Stanford law professor, Janet Cooper Alexander, studiedshareholder suits arising from a 1983 initial public offeringboom in Silicon Valley, and found that most cases weresettled for about the same percentage of market-value loss,regardless of a company's wrongdoing. The evidence suggeststhat cases are being resolved for the wrong reason, she says.&quot;The settlement process is fundamentally sick,&quot; says Ms.Alexander, who is publishing an article on the subject inthis month's issue of the Stanford Law Review.   Certainly, shareholder suits remain a safeguard againstcorporate wrongdoing. &quot;We have had remarkable success ingetting substantial recoveries for our clients,&quot; says MelWeiss, a New York shareholder attorney. &quot;It has been abargain for the kind of work we do.&quot;   Mr. Weiss's firm, Milberg, Weiss, Bershad, Specthrie andamp;Lerach, led the legal team that won a $757 million settlementin 1989 arising from the collapse of the Washington PublicPower Supply System only to see a federal judge last Novembergrant just $36 million of the attorneys' $108 millionrequested fee.   Such decisions are having a sobering effect on theplaintiff bar, Mr. Weiss says. &quot;A lot of people do not wantto take the risks in these mega-cases any more.&quot;   The reduced WPPSS award included an average hourly billingrate of some $237. By comparision, according to a recentstudy published by Class Action Reports Inc., a Washington,D.C., legal periodical, rates approved in class-action casessince 1973 have averaged $360 an hour.   The bar brawl in the Oracle case arose after a majority ofthe firms voted to appoint Milberg Weiss and Philadelphia'sBerger andamp; Montague as lead counsel. San Francisco lawyer DavidGold opposed the selection and alleged in open court thatMilberg Weiss and Berger used &quot;Mayor Daley electoralprocesses&quot; to get elected. (Mr. Coffee, the Columbia lawprofessor, has described the process of choosing lead counselas a &quot;brokered political convention without a credentialscommittee.&quot;) Milberg Weiss and Berger, meanwhile, describedMr. Gold as an unelectable malcontent and &quot;obnoxiouslyold-fashioned.&quot;   Partly because of this contentiousness, none of them gotthe job. Judge Walker selected New York's Lowey, Dannenberg,Bemporad, Brachtl andamp; Selinger, which offered to cap litigationexpenses at $325,000, or 35% less than the $500,000 projectedby the Berger firm, its closest rival. Mr. Gold, who says itwould cost at least $560,000 to do the job right, hasappealed, saying Judge Walker has &quot;seriously impaired theclass's ability to maximize its recovery.&quot;   To be sure, the Oracle approach raises questions. It posesa potential disincentive where an attorney has hit hisexpense limit and could further pursue a case only at his ownpersonal expense. It might give the defense incentive tostretch out a case, if it knows the plaintiffs' lawyers has alimited budget. (Mel Goldman, the San Francisco defenselawyer who represents Oracle, says he would never do that.)   Stressing price alone could also loosen the grip that &quot;thesame old gang&quot; of plaintiff attorneys, as Judge Walker callsthem, has over these cases. But critics say it opens the doorfor an unqualified attorney to seize the litigation and makea mess of it. &quot;You may get what you pay for,&quot; says RichardGreenfield, a Philadelphia plaintiffs' attorney. &quot;Many firmsin the plaintiffs' bar are not capable of delivering maximumor optimal results.&quot;   Nonetheless, Mr. Coffee says, &quot;lots of people are talkingabout (Judge Walker's ruling). I think people will probablybegin to follow Oracle to some degree.&quot;   In other cases, courts are retreating from nearly twodecades of awarding plaintiff attorneys a multiple of theiractual hours as a bonus for winning risky cases, partlybecause plaintiff attorneys have become adept at predictinghow cases will turn out. In the WPPSS case, for instance, thejudge granted a 28% increase over actual hours, though Mr.Weiss and other attorneys sought a 350% increase.   Last September, Chicago federal judge John Grady gaveplaintiffs' attorneys only about half of the $9 million theywanted for winning a $45 million settlement in a case arisingfrom the 1984 federal bailout of Continental IllinoisNational Bank.   The lawyers billed at an hourly rate of up to $315 andsought a $2 million bonus for their good work, but the judgecapped the rate at $175 and eliminated the bonus, citing&quot;incessant conferring&quot; and regular deployment of a &quot;smallarmy&quot; of lawyers to argue simple motions. He also said muchwork in the case could have been handled by less-high-poweredlawyers.   Among those he scorned were no less than Mr. Greenfieldand his law partner, who presented a bill of $9,440 for atrip to Chicago to confer on what the judge called a&quot;routine&quot; pretrial order. &quot;Every moment in transit wasapparently spent working on the case,&quot; the judge said, notingthat Mr. Greenfield and his partner billed their travel timeat their full hourly rate. The judge chopped the request by75%. Mr. Greenfield says the decision was &quot;contrary toprevailing law.&quot; He has appealed, as has Mr. Weiss in theWPPSS case.   Some judges don't like counting hours and are setting feesas a percentage of whatever recovery the attorneys manage forshareholders. This removes an incentive for plaintiffattorneys to run up their billable hours and prolong cases,an approach that has played into the hands of deep-pocketinsurance-company defendants &quot;who want to hold on to theirmoney as long as possible,&quot; says Patrick Mahoney, a SanFrancisco lawyer who defends shareholder suits.   Stanford's Ms. Alexander says the percentage-fee approachhas problems, too, and adds that all the recent tinkeringwith fees ignores the central issue of meritwhether theoutcome of a case bears a relationship to the harm done. Sheargues that defendants should become less gun-shy abouttrying cases. In the California federal courts where theOracle suit and many other cases against Silicon Valleycompanies have been brought in recent years, no securitiesclass action has ever gone through a complete trial.   Richard Dannenberg, who will now lead the Oracle chargeunless Judge Walker is reversed, has no qualms. &quot;I amsatisified with the terms of my employment,&quot; he says. &quot;Ourcountry is based on free and open competition. So, why shouldlawyers be any different?&quot;   ---           Shaking Up the Fee Structure                                                                                                          A sampling of recent securities-law cases in which judgeshave slashed fee awards for plaintiffs' lawyers                                                                                                        SETTLEMENT       FEES SOUGHT             FEES GRANTED (millions of (millions   (As % of    (millions  (As % of dollars)     of dollars) settlement) of dollars) settlement)                                                                                                        Washington Public Power Supply System   $757.0       $108.0       14%         $36.0       5%                                                                                                        Triangle Industries Inc.    $70.0        $15.0       21%         $12.0      17%                                                                                                        Continental Illinois    $45.0         $9.0       20%          $4.6      10%                                                                                                        First Fidelity Bancorp.    $30.9         $8.0       26%          $6.0      19%                                                                                                        Lyphomed Inc.    $10.5         $3.0       29%          $1.0      10%                                                                                                          NOTE: All fee awards were determined in 1990; some arebeing appealed   Sources: Class Reports Inc. and lawyers</TEXT></DOC>
