As details of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board's blueprint forreviving the nation's second-largest thrift trickle out, analysts,legislators and competitors are sounding calls for caution.   Some fret over the planned transfer of American to theaggressive Bass investment group and suggestions that the revivedcompany could be allowed to venture beyond the standard Sandamp;Lbusiness of home loans and savings accounts.   Others recall what they see as regulatory inaction during thecompany's four-year slide toward receivership, a slide most blameon aggressive management, too-rapid growth and risky real estateloans.   American Savings andamp; Loan Association, with headquarters inStockton and 186 branches throughout California, was seized by thebank board Tuesday as a prelude to turning it over to the Robert M.Bass Group of Fort Worth, Texas. Bass will pump $550 million cashinto the insolvent thrift, and the bank board has committed $2billion in cash and promissory notes over the next decade.   American continues to operate; its parent company, FinancialCorp. of America in Irvine, Calif., announced plans to file afederal bankruptcy petition.   American's problems pre-date the 1983 joining of State Savings andamp;Loan and American Savings andamp; Loan, the merger gave the company itspresent form.   State, under Chairman Robert Knapp, was known for making loanson commercial real estate ventures and developments spurned byother Sandamp;Ls. American was a virtual opposite, with a large branchnetwork and a portfolio of conservative home loans and savingsaccounts on which it paid relatively low interest.   Regulators already keeping an eye on State believed that themerger, which created what was then the nation's biggest Sandamp;L, wouldstabilize Knapp's company.   But American grew rapidly under Knapp, in part by making loanswith fixed interest rates, a strategy that has come back to hauntAmerican in periods of rising rates.   In the summer of 1984, bank board analysts were warning thatloans made by American and the old State Savings on real estate hadbeen made without adequate analysis of the true value of theproperties.   Institutional investors were quietly withdrawing deposits amid aflurry of news reports about loan problems at American.   A real depositor run began in 1984, after the Securities andExchange Commission forced American to restate its second-quarterresults to account for losses on mortgage-backed securities,turning a $31 million profit into a $107 million loss.   Losses from the run eventually were tallied at $6 billion. InAugust 1984, Knapp was forced out by the bank board and replaced byWilliam Popejoy.   Popejoy, who had once been president of the old AmericanSavings, proceeded to cut costs, laying off 1,500 workers andselling 475 company cars and five jets.   Management added to the company's reserve against bad loans, tothe point where the reserve stood at more than $1.2 billion as ofJune 30.   But after a period of shrinking American, Popejoy concluded theonly way to save the company was to expand, adding branches andbuying securities backed by mortgages with fixed interest rates.   That's counter to an industry trend in recent years to issuemortgages with adjustable rates to protect the lender againstrising interest rates.   Competitors have pressed the bank board to rein in American,concerned that a big rescue would drive up their required paymentsto the industry's government-run insurance fund, the FederalSavings and Loan Insurance Corp.   Stockholders have accused Popejoy of failing to disclose theextent of the company's problems with bad loans and foreclosed realestate.   Critics also have focused on a provision of the bailout thatwould allow American to engage in merchant banking, somethingbeyond traditional Sandamp;L business.   At a U.S. House Banking Committee hearing Thursday, bank boardChairman Danny Wall, seeking to allay fears American could ventureonto risky ground, disclosed restrictions on the proposed merchantbanking operation.   The merchant bank would be limited to $1.5 billion in assets andwould be barred from direct real estate investment or development.   It would be barred from investing in gambling activities,foreign firms, precious metals, commodities, futures and options.And the bank board would have the right to step in to stopactivities it deems too risky.</TEXT></DOC>
