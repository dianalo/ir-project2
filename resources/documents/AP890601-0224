Gen. Michel Aoun's Christian administration called for``consolidating'' a cease-fire proclaimed by the Arab leaders lastFriday after a four-day summit in Morocco.   Premier Salim Hoss, who heads the rival Moslem cabinet, approvedthe summit's decisions hours after they were made. On Thursday, hisgovernment recommended ``speeding up'' implementation of theresolutions.   The competing governments have existed since a political crisisdeveloped in September.   Several formations of Israeli jets roared over Beirut aftersunset Thursday, drawing anti-aircraft fire from both Christian andMoslem forces. Police said it may have been the first time Aoun'sgunners fired at Israeli warplanes, which have patrolled Lebanonfor years.   Press reports said the siege of the Christian enclave east ofBeirut might be lifted next week because of the Arab League'sefforts.   Moslem forces sealed off the 310-square-mile area soon afterartillery duels began March 8 between Aoun's Christian army unitsand an alliance of Syrian troops and Druse militiamen.   Although the Arab League declared a truce in April, Syriangunners have continued shelling the Christian coastline northeastof Beirut to keep Aoun's forces from bringing in supplies.   A statement issued after the Christian government's three-hourmeeting demanded the siege be lifted and said Aoun's 20,000soldiers were willing to end their blockade of illegal ports run byMoslem militias. The blockade was imposed March 6 and the artillerywar began two days later.   Aoun's cabinet said it ``welcomes the wresting of the Lebaneseproblem from Syria's monopolizing fist.''   At the summit, King Hassan II of Morocco, King Fahd of SaudiArabia and the president of Algeria, Chadli Bendjedid, weredesignated to find a settlement in Lebanon within six months.   The Christian statement said the three leaders ``enjoy theconfidence and respect of the Lebanese people.''   It said Christians would not discuss changes in the politicalsystem, which the Moslem majority demands, until the Syrianswithdrew from Lebanon.   Christians were the majority when Lebanon became independent ofFrance in 1943 and have dominated the government, military andjudiciary. Under an unwritten agreement, the president isChristian, the premier Sunni Moslem and the parliament speakerShiite Moslem.   Syria has 40,000 soldiers in Lebanon under an Arab Leaguepeacekeeping mandate issued in 1976 and has become the main powerbroker during the long civil war.   Not long after the artillery battles began, Aoun declared a``war of liberation'' against the Syrians. The statement Thursdaysaid: ``The Lebanese people ... can freely express their opinionsin reforming their domestic affairs ... only after the removal ofthe occupation.''   Also included in the statement was an accusation that Syria wasbehind a plot to kill Aoun.   It called the plot ``a clear symbol of Syrian terrorism ... toeliminate the head of the legal authority.''   The Christian government said it would seek the extradition fromCyprus of six Lebanese arrested in Larnaca, Cyprus, last Fridaywith a large cache of weapons, including anti-aircraft missiles.The Moslem cabinet also has requested extradition.   One of the six told a court hearing they had planned to shootdown a helicopter carrying Aoun to Cyprus. Aoun was expected topass through Larnaca on his way to the Arab summit, but did notattend the meeting.</TEXT></DOC>
