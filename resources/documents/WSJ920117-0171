For the past decade, General Ecology, Lionville, Pa., hassupplied water purifiers to soldiers and explorers in placessuch as Angola and Mount Everest. But the company's FirstNeed device is too bulky to fit easily into a businessperson's luggage.   By the end of next month, General Ecology says, it willbegin marketing its Trav-L-Pure system, which is the size ofa very fat paperback book and weighs 22 ounces. The companysays its new purifier removes bacteria, cysts, particulates,trace solvents, pesticides, herbicides and foul tastes andodors. Trav-L-Pure can clean about a pint of water a minute.   As for hepatitis-A and other viruses, General Ecologypresident Richard Williams says it's &quot;impractical, if notimpossible&quot; to evaluate any purifier's effectiveness ateliminating these. Even so, each Trav-L-Pure includes iodinetablets, which the instructions say &quot;remove&quot; viruses.   Mr. Williams criticizes the purifiers mentioned in thisspace June 25. Recovery Engineering's Pur Traveler, he says,pumps water through an iodine-impregnated matrix too fast tokill many harmful organisms.   Thomas Klein, sales vice president at RecoveryEngineering, Minneapolis, says Pur Traveler is designed toensure that every virus collides at least 30 times withiodine molecules, which he says is enough to kill any virus.                                                                                                          Making It Easier   To Soak the Elderly                                                                                                          TUB MAKERS have yet to produce a bathtub for older peoplethat's good looking and safe, gets the job done and doesn'tcost a fortune. So said this column on Dec. 2.   A Sewell, N.J., company begs to differ. Electric Mobilityplans to start selling its Dignity Bath in the next month ortwo. The bath has a built-in seat that rises and fallsthrough water pressure, moving a bather into or out of thetub water in seconds.   Thomas Ehrmann, a sales director at Electric Mobility,says his company has Americanized the British-designed tubby, for example, reducing its length to five feet from 5 1/2.The price won't be right for everyone: Dignity Bath willstart at $4,495.   If that's too steep, bathers can buy a water-powered liftalone for about $650. The Bath Lift, distributed byWhittaker, Yonkers, N.Y., clings to the bottom of an ordinarytub with suction cups.                                                                                                          Conversion Lets Car Seat   Double as a Stroller                                                                                                          SOME PEOPLE like to make it themselves.   John Novelli, Philadelphia, has put together a homemadeversion of the Sit'n'Stroll car seat/stroller featured hereSept. 24. Sit'n'Stroll converts from a backward-facing carseat into a forward-facing stroller. Made by SafelineChildren's Products, Denver, it costs $139.   Mr. Novelli took an off-the-shelf car seat and used abungee cord to attach it to a luggage cart. He uses hisdevice to transport year-old daughter Elisa.   Mr. Novelli says his device would work with any child'scar seat. Adding a heavy-duty luggage cart costs about $60.The car seat can face forward or backward. Once kids aregrown, parents still have a luggage cart.                                                                                                          Support Is at Hand   For Staying on Feet                                                                                                          HOW to help older people keep walking?   The July 16 Form+Function told of a New York surgeon,Julius Jacobson, who had invented a chair-walker for adults,with a pneumatic seat to help users stand up and to catchthem if they fall. Designed by Tanaka Kapec, South Norwalk,Conn., this product has yet to move beyond prototypes.   Meanwhile, gerontologist Mary Harroun, Northbrook, Ill.,claims sales of 800 of her Merry Walkers. This chair-walkeris made of white plastic and canvas in eight colors. It'smade and sold by Innovative Products Unlimited of Niles,Mich., and Appleton, Wis.   Other chair-walkers are on the market. First ChoiceInternational, Emporia, Kan., says it has sold 700 of itsmetal Chariot Ambulators. The nursing-home model has athree-foot circular base that a user must step over. The homeversion, just out, is narrower and shaped like a horseshoe.</TEXT></DOC>
