<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-55-0736 </DOCNO><TEXT>A study of Singapore's economy with special reference to the energy sector,revealed the following: Singapore has no domestic energy resources, nocoal-handling infrastructure or gas-import system. It relies wholly onimported petroleum for its energy supply. Singapore is currently negotiatinggas-supply arrangements with Malaysia and Indonesia, primarily for usein the electric-power sector. As a percentage of demand, Singapore isone of the world's largest consumers of fuel oil. Proposed gas importscould have a substantial impact on the present pattern of energy demand.Energy consumption amounts to 40 percent of its energy imports; the bulkof energy imports are re-exported, either after further processing orafter temporary storage. Since refiners must face the external marketas their primary outlet for products, government policy has only a minimaleffect on the economics of refining. Singapore's domestic oil marketis one of the world's most reponsive in terms of following world marketconditions; the degree of government interference in the refining sectoris comparable to that seen in the United States. Although Singapore refiningactually contracted following the 1979 price increases, Singapore's rolein the world oil market has steadily expanded. The collapse of Singaporerefining has been incorrectly predicted many times since 1973. The sophisticationof Singapore's refining industry has traditionally been operational ratherthan technological. However, Shell, Esso, and Mobil plan major upgradingand cracking additions for completion in the early 1990s. This will increaseSingapore's technical flexibility to levels that compare favorably withJapan and most other Asian countries and will help to ensure that Singaporewill remain the center of the Asian-Pacific oil market into the foreseeablefuture. 31 refs., 1 fig., 13 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
