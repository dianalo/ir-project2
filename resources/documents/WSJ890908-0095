Chard Hirsch, who owned a dress shop on the town square, looked up one day to see police and television crews gathered in front of the bank. &quot;I thought the bank had been robbed,&quot; she says. Actually, it had failed, along with two other banks and more than one-third of the businesses downtown. Then, the fire marshal condemned the town's only hotel.    The town's deterioration &quot;was like a total eclipse,&quot; says Tom Schmitt, former publisher of the Broken Bow newspaper, who left and now owns a paper in Ravenswood, W.Va.    By the end of the year, the few remaining businesspeople gathered for drinks. &quot;It was black comedy, but we had a survival party,&quot; Mrs. Hirsch says.    But unlike thousands of American hamlets that never recovered from the farm crisis, Broken Bow came storming back -- thanks largely to small businesses.    Today, a picture of vitality unfolds around the spacious frontier-era town square. The shops are occupied, the void filled by several recent startups. New ventures, ranging from a maker of grounds-maintenance equipment to a housewares producer to a telemarketer, have created more than 100 jobs in the past three years and generated millions of dollars in revenue from out of state.    In many rural areas that are managing to sustain themselves, &quot;the entrepreneurial environment is the key,&quot; says Mark G. Popovitch, senior staff associate at the Council of State Policy and Planning Agencies. &quot;In many cases, small business is where the lion's share of job generation and wealth generation is occurring.&quot;    All over rural America, small business -- from light manufacturers and food processors to retailers and tourism and telecommunications companies -- is playing a growing economic role. The shrinking of bedrock rural industries such as lumber, agriculture and manufacturing has galvanized many people to find alternatives.    A recent Small Business Administration analysis showed that businesses with fewer than 20 employees are by far the most important source of job growth in rural America, generating 63% of new employment between 1980 and 1986, compared with 37% in urban areas.    Wanting to preserve a way of life for their families in towns where they have deep roots, rural entrepreneurs often benefit from an extra measure of zeal: You can't just walk across the street for another job if the business fails.    The result in some rural areas is a slow grass-roots revitalization, with each dollar invested by entrepreneurs generating more wealth from sales outside the region.    Many federal and state officials are concluding that farm subsidies and incentives to manufacturers to open rural plants aren't the only way to treat the rural economy's ills. A new crop of economic-development programs with an entrepreneurial bias has sprung up as a result. The goal of the programs is to help diversify the rural economy, sustain people's income and slow a century-long slide in the rural population.    Rural start-ups have remained statistically almost invisible. Many don't incorporate or seek conventional credit or insurance services as early as urban businesses, so they don't show up in standard small-business data bases.    In telephone surveys of hundreds of small businesses in Iowa, North Dakota, and other rural states, the Council of State Policy and Planning Agencies found that rural counties are keeping pace with other areas in forming new enterprises. The bleak economic climate didn't seem to slow the rate of new business starts.    Broken Bow, population 3,800, is a striking example. Rather than curbing new enterprise, the six-year farm recession that ended in 1987 seemed to stimulate the town. Bob Goodner, a longtime resident, was devastated by the failure of the farm-equipment dealership where he worked and held a partnership interest. For a while, &quot;I wasn't in any mental state to do anything,&quot; he says.    But he and his wife, Joyce, had lived 32 years and raised six children in Broken Bow. &quot;I guess we have pretty deep roots here,&quot; says Mr. Goodner, an intense, soft-spoken man in jeans and dusty, paint-spattered shoes. To pass time, he began experimenting with wood in his garage, carving tiny outhouses to amuse his family and friends.    He discovered he had a talent for designing wood products, and he began to craft housewares, including shelves, wall hooks and other items. He and his wife traveled to crafts shows, then learned through friends of a home-sales distribution company in Denver. Now, Goodners' Fine Wood sells products in 30 states.    The Goodners employ farm women and others seeking to supplement their income to do piecework. They also own a retail store on the town square, Selectibles, which displays the work of 68 regional artisans.    The payoff for Broken Bow is significant out-of-state revenue: Mr. Goodner estimates that 85% of the two companies' projected $200,000 in sales this year will come from outside Nebraska.    &quot;There's so much talent out here,&quot; Mr. Goodner says, showing a visitor the store's two long aisles of sewn toys, crafts and ceramics. That reservoir of talent, coupled with low costs, readily available labor and the Goodners' willingness to work extremely hard, have given the couple a competitive edge.    Other Broken Bow residents demonstrated similar initiative. Worried by the town's economic collapse, a few dozen residents organized a non-profit development corporation called Nest Builders and raised $40,000 by selling stock in $200 chunks. The money was used mainly for loans or loan guarantees for small businesses.    Ray Brown, a leading entrepreneur, bought the town's condemned frontier-era hotel with three partners and converted it into apartments. &quot;I didn't want another great big empty building boarded up on the square,&quot; says Mr. Brown, who in 1946 founded Brown andamp; Denisia Inc., a nationwide nursing-home developer based in Broken Bow.    On his own, he also converted a nearby furniture store into a small mall, offering cheap retail space to local businesses. With Mrs. Hirsch, the shop owner, as its manager, the mall functions as a small-business incubator, a low-cost, nurturing startup environment. The eight businesses there, including several retailers, a restaurant and a travel agency, employ 21 people. Several others, including an eye-care provider and an insurance agency, have graduated to larger spaces around the town square.    In all, the 100 jobs created by Broken Bow's flock of new businesses in the past four years is twice the employment increase at the town's biggest single employer, Becton, Dickinson andamp; Co., a maker of health-care products.    &quot;We try our darnedest to create jobs,&quot; says Mrs. Hirsch. &quot;And preferably jobs not linked to the farm economy.&quot;    &quot;The farm economy is always six months from disaster,&quot; says Paul Stec, a restaurant owner and one of Nest Builders's founders. &quot;We're all aware of that.&quot;    Reading through the Yellow Pages sparked ideas about what businesses were needed, such as a children's clothes store. A suggestion from a real estate agent led to the formation of another new business, R-Vee Telemarketing, which employs 27 workers and had $390,000 in revenue last year.    Nest Builders has promoted or financed flops, too: a jackhammer for home and garden use, for instance, and a pressure gauge for farmers' fertilizer tanks. (The group now owns a garageful of gauges.)    A lasting benefit is greater economic diversification. The farm crisis spurred entrepreneur Jackson Ideen, a native Nebraskan, to switch from making farm equipment to manufacturing grounds-maintenance tools. He now employs seven people at Wikco Industries Inc. near Broken Bow. Through catalogs and fliers, he markets equipment, including log-splitting and tire-changing devices he invented.    Mrs. Hirsch also worked with several small businesses to help them expand their markets beyond Broken Bow. &quot;I don't think {people in} rural America have a good grasp on their abilities,&quot; she says. &quot;There has to be someone who stands there and yells and screams and stamps his feet and says, 'Let's do it] Let's do it]'&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
