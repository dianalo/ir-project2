<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-31-0303 </DOCNO><TEXT>A novel reactor that can process high solids concentrations is describedfor the anaerobic fermentation of lignocellulosic material, specifically,processed municipal solid waste. The reactor has a total volume of approximately20 liters and is hydraulically driven. The solids in the reactor aremixed by a blade with a horizontal axis. Several different mixing bladedesigns were tested on uninoculated solids for mixing quality and horsepowerrequirement, and the blade design requiring the least power input wasselected for further study. The reactor has been inoculated with solids,and initial production of methane is reported. 8 references, 16 figures.</TEXT></DOC>
