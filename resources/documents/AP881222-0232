(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   In the two decades since an Army ammunitiondepot closed and stripped this town of more than 500 jobs, Edgemonthas tried to find another healthy payroll, even courting a string ofpotentially hazardous industries.   A uranium mining and milling operation succeeded for a while,then closed. Town leaders also wooed companies that proposed alow-level nuclear waste dump, a sewage ash processing plant, amunitions testing site and, most recently, a landfill for municipalwaste from Northeastern cities.   For various reasons, including opposition from environmentalgroups, all the proposals failed. A farmer raised pigs on the basefor a time but recently pulled out because of falling pork prices.   ``We need more jobs, and we're still looking,'' Mayor Pete Ziemetsaid. ``The only thing we have going for us, which I guess is bothbad and good, is the notoriety Edgemont has had.''   Other civic leaders fear they may never find the industry neededto fill the empty houses and stores in this town sitting on thesouthern edge of the Black Hills, where pine-covered mountains giveway to rough grasslands covered with sagebrush and yucca plants.   ``Everything just seemed to go haywire. ... Just little bylittle, everything went wrong,'' said former Mayor Matt Brown.``I've been here all my life, and so help me God, I can't put myfinger on anything that will salvage the town. Maybe we can belucky.''   A Defense Department survey of 100 communities that lost militarybases from 1961 to 1977 reported that some towns prospered byconverting the bases to other uses. But Edgemont is one of theplaces that has never recovered after the military left town.   The Black Hills Army Depot, which stored ammunition in concretebunkers at a place called Igloo eight miles south of Edgemont, wasopened in the 1940s and closed in 1967. Brown said Edgemont not onlylost 500-odd civilian jobs but also many long-time Edgemontresidents who were transferred to civilian jobs at other militarybases.   Four local businessmen bought the 15,000-acre base to prepare itfor other uses, but it still lies empty. Rows of concrete igloos sitlike loaves of bread on the prairie. Near the base entrance, housesand administrative buildings are falling apart.   Edgemont's population grew to 1,772 by 1960, but fell to lessthan 1,200 within a few years of the base's closing.   The town's economy and population recovered in the 1970s, withthe uranium mill and a Burlington Northern Railroad crew-shiftstation both busy. Ziemet estimates Edgemont now has only 1,130people, a drop of about 20 percent since 1980.   The mayor said 70 houses out of several hundred in town areempty, and 27 should be razed because they're falling apart. Peopletrying to sell homes will be lucky to get 50 cents on the dollar, hesaid.   The railroad is still a bright spot in the local economy.Burlington Northern switches crews at Edgemont and provides a goodnational connection, Ziemet said.   The uranium operation closed due to lack of demand, and the 110people now cleaning up uranium tailings will be out of work when thecleanup is completed next year, he said.   City and state officials have provided financing to help re-opena factory that makes wooden bowls and other items from walnut, andthe plant should employ up to 30 people.   But the town has yet to find an industrial use for the abandonedammunition depot.   Cattle are grazed on the base, but an operation that raised hogsin the concrete igloos has been stopped at least temporarily. A planto use the igloos for grain storage also washed out, Ziemet said.   In 1983, Chem-Nuclear Systems Inc. proposed burying up toone-third of the nation's low-level nuclear waste at the base. Theplan was scrapped after geological tests showed the site wasunsuitable, and state voters rejected a proposed multi-state compactthat would have allowed the dump.   Consolidated Management Corp. of Reno, Nev., last year hauledalmost 300,000 tons of incinerated sewage from St. Paul, Minn., tothe old base, where the company planned to build a plant to extractgold and other precious metals from the ash. The company missedseveral deadlines to start the plant, however, and the state now issearching for a way to dispose of the ash.   Honeywell Inc. wanted to set up a munitions testing operation ina canyon near Edgemont but abandoned the plan after a coalition ofIndians and others opposed it.   Edgemont now is working with South Dakota Disposal Systems Inc.,headquartered in Colorado, on a plan to bury 1 million tons ofmunicipal garbage a year. Edgemont could get more than $1 million ayear from the plan, which also would create up to 50 jobs, companyofficials have said.   The succession of proposals dealing with hazardous materials hasangered some local residents and environmental groups across SouthDakota.   Ruth Kern, who lives on a ranch south of town and opposes all thewaste disposal ideas, said Edgemont is gaining a reputation as aplace willing to become the nation's dumping ground.   Kern said residents are partly responsible for the base closing20 years ago because they complained all the time and didn't wantthe ``riffraff'' from the base in town. She criticized Edgemontofficials for seeking hazardous dumps that she said wouldn't provideenough jobs to save the town in any event.   ``I don't want to see it go under, but neither can I support itwhen they want to do something to pollute my environment,'' Kernsaid. ``I'm tired of having everybody in the United States look atus as someplace they can bring in stuff to dump.''   Kern's stance has drawn criticism from townspeople who want jobs,whatever the industry. Brown is upset that environmental groups havebeen able to block virtually all the town's industrial proposals.   ``For some reason, we can't seem to whip it,'' he said. ``I'dlike to win one for a change.''   Ziemet, who's been mayor for the past decade, said he wouldn'tsupport any industry that would contaminate ground, air or water,but he believes state and federal officials can make sure theproposed garbage dump is operated safely.   Some of the national publicity has upset Ziemet and others.   A recent Wall Street Journal story said the state and town actedtoo hastily when they allowed the Minnesota sewage ash to be hauledto the abandoned base. Ziemet said no one could know the companywould run out of money before it built the processing plant, whichhe said would have been an environmentalist's dream had it succeededin tranforming sewage into worthwhile products.   He compared the town's situation to someone without a job. No onewould criticize the person for taking a job on a garbage truck, hesaid.   ``All we want is a job,'' he repeated. ``I believe something isgoing to come.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Mon PMs, Dec. 26</NOTE></DOC>
