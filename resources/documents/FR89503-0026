Huther at 703-557-1572.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>In response to Pub. L. 96-517, the1980 legislation which amended patent and trademark laws, the PTO preparedand submitted a plan for the automation of its operations to Congress onDecember 13, 1982. The plan centered on two basic concepts: the creationof electronic data bases that: (1) Would eventually replace the PTO's all-paperpatent and trademark files, and thereby improve their integrity and quality;and (2) would support searches, examinations, Office actions and otherOffice functions through electronic workstations which would provide textand image retrieval capabilities and perform other automation functions.Over 700,000 active Federal trademark registrations have been convertedto an electronic data base of textual and digital image data. An IBM-basedcomputer system has been installed to enable examiners to search the database for textual data and codes describing designs, and to retrieve anddisplay all information as a substitute for paper file searches. Trademarkexaminers have been using T-Search exclusively since January 1988, andthe capability is ready to be deployed for public use in the TrademarkSearch Library.An Automated Patent System (APS) was installed for test and evaluationpurposes, using one patent examining group as an operational testbed. Majoroperational components of APS_large scale computers with conventional magneticstorage devices, a high-speed local area data communications network, andelectronic workstations equipped with two high resolution graphic displaysand laser printers_were interconnected on July 1, 1986 to enable systemtest and evaluation to begin in the testbed group. Optical disk storageunits were subsequently installed to house the test data base of digitalimages of U.S. and foreign patents. In December 1987, the testbed patentexaminers began using the APS image search and retrieval capability (APS-Image)in a live production environment. Based on recommendations of an IndustryReview Panel appointed by the Deputy Secretary of Commerce to review theOffice's patent automation program, changes were made and the testbed examinersare using a stable, reliable system suited to their need. The digital imageretrieval capability of APS has been stabilized in the testbed, which nowis being used as an operational testbed for deployment to other patentexamining groups. A decision on the next incremental deployment of thedigital image retrieval and other electronic searching capabilities isplanned to be made in mid-1989. Additional system capabilities for officeautomation and other administrative support will be added to those alreadyinstalled in the testbed over the next several months to supplement thesearch and retrieval capabilities. Examiners will be provided access tocommercial data bases, such as industry-specific data bases, from the electronicworkstations.PTO continues to digitize the entire backfile of almost five million U.S.patents. The source for the digital image scanning operation is the archivalset of patent documents which is believed to contain the best availablecopy of each patent. First, images of all U.S. patents in the testbed group'ssearch files were converted to digital form and placed on optical disksfor use in electronic classification and combined text classification searches.Subsequently, the remaining patents were captured. These patents will bewritten to optical disk and loaded on APS before APS-Image can be deployedto the remaining patent examining groups and the public. Through exchangeagreements with the European and Japanese Patent Offices, European patentsissued since 1920 and all Japanese patents have been or will be convertedto a common facsimile standard and key patents will be entered for on-lineretrieval.On-line access to the full-text of all U.S. patents granted after 1974and the English language abstracts of Japanese and Chinese patents_a database of more than two million records representing about 52 gigabytes ofdata_was deployed to the patent examining staff beginning in June 1986.Access to this full-text data base (APS-Text) permits examiners to searchthe text of more than one million U.S. patents containing more than fivebillion words. Today, all examiners have been trained in the use of thefull-text searching tool, and it has become a routine part of the patentexamination process. Searches are conducted from single screen text terminalslocated throughout the Office, supported by a NAS-9080 dual processor.The APS-Text capability is ready for deployment to the public in the PatentPublic Search Room.The PTO intends to enter the text of U.S. patents issued after 1970.To fulfill its mission to disseminate information and to guide the managementof its electronic information resources, on June 8, 1984, the PTO issuedguidelines and policies for dissemination and distribution of electronicpatent data. These were published at 49 FR 2485 (June 14, 1984). Subsequently,the Office of Management and Budget issued revised policies and expandedguidelines for electronic data dissemination in OMB Circular A-130 datedDecember 1985 and entitled ``Management of Federal Information Resources.''On August 20, 1987, PTO published at 52 FR 31442 a notice (1) To informthe public of the PTO's intention to amend its pricing policy for database products, and to expand the scope of its dissemination policies andguidelines to encompass patent and trademark electronic data; (2) to explainthe current situation with regard to public access to automated patentand trademark search rooms and libraries; and (3) to solicit public commentson the intended proposals.On December 10, 1987, PTO published at 52 FR 46815 a notice amending thepricing policy for data base products and expanding the scope of the policiesand guidelines to encompass patent and trademark data. That notice alsoextended the period to December 31, 1987, for receiving public commentson alternatives for funding public access to patent or trademark searchrooms or libraries.On June 23, 1988, PTO published at 53 FR 23677 a notice informing the publicof its intention to publish a comprehensive edition of the policies andguidelines to replace the versions published in the June 14, 1984 and December10, 1987 notices.In that notice, the PTO also published a summary of the comments receivedon the three alternatives for financing public access to the automatedsearch systems in PTO's public search rooms and libraries. Subsequently,Pub. L. 100-703 was enacted on November 19, 1988. That law allows the Commissionerof Patents and Trademarks to establish reasonable fees for access by thepublic to the automated search systems.<ITAG tagnum="84">Response to Comments</ITAG><T3>Comment: </T3>If user fees are established for public access to theautomated patent and trademark systems, will those fees also be chargedby the Patent Depository Libraries (PDLs)?<T3>Response: </T3>Arrangements will be worked out between the PTO andindividual libraries for providing access to the automated search system.Arrangements will depend on each library's authority to collect user feesfor the service on their own or the PTO's behalf. Fees for access in PDLswould be adjusted to account for any different equipment costs, maintenanceand added telecommunications costs.<T3>Comment: </T3>How would PDLs administer the free access provision ofPub. L. 100-703?<T3>Response: </T3>Based on PTO's policy for administering this provision,arrangements would be worked out with individual libraries.<T3>Comment: </T3>One respondent asked if PTO conducted a study to determinethe potential demand in PDLs for trademark information and patent information.<T3>Response: </T3>Several surveys on the demand for patent and trademarkinformation have been conducted which provide unofficial indications tothe PTO for the need for patent and trademark information. Reports to thePTO indicate that the demand for trademark information is increasing.<T3>Comment: </T3>One respondent wanted clarification of what will ultimatelybe available to the PDLs_paper, microfilm, electronic data.<T3>Response: </T3>The form of the patent and trademark information ineach PDL ultimately will depend on decisions made between the PTO and individualPDLs and the technology and economics of remote access for providing accessto the automated search systems.<T3>Comment: </T3>If PTO contracts for the provision of public access,who owns the PTO data base?<T3>Response: </T3>The PTO will continue to own the PTO data base.<T3>Comment: </T3>One respondent claimed that section B is inconsistentwith OMB Circular A-130 and the order of sub-paragraphs B(1) and B(2) shouldbe reversed.<T3>Response: </T3>Section B relates only the PTO search facilities andPDLs. This policy is consistent with OMB Circular A-130 by providing aninformation ``safety net'' to the public through the dissemination of informationin the search facilities and libraries. PTO states in paragraph F that,outside the search facilities and libraries, it will encourage the privatesector to offer commercial patent and trademark search and retrieval services,and it will not compete with the private sector.Sub-paragraphs B(1) and B(2) state that PTO will choose the most efficientmeans for providing search and retrieval services in its search facilitiesand PDLs, directly and/or through a contractor.<T3>Comment: </T3>One respondent suggested that there might be misunderstandingbetween sections C and E.<T3>Response: </T3>Section C specifically refers to commercial data baseswhereas section E refers to PTO-owned data bases.<T3>Comment: </T3>In section D, what does the term ``existing collectionsin the PDLs'' mean?<T3>Response: </T3>In the June 23, 1988 edition of the <T4>Federal Register, </T4>the reference to ``existing collections'' meantthe collections held by each individual library. Collections vary fromlibrary to library, and acquisition of collections is up to each individualPDL. Section D has been revised because section 104(c) of Pub. L. 100-703allows the Commissioner to establish reasonable fees for on-line accessto the automated search systems.<T3>Comment: </T3>Section E provides for the possibility that a commercialsearch and retrieval service could be substituted for the PTO automatedsystems in the PDLs. Would the PDLs be required to absorb to cost?<T3>Response: </T3>Arrangements would be worked out between the PTO andeach individual library and would depend on the library's ability to providecommercial services on its premises.<T3>Comment: </T3>One respondent asked for a brief explanation of OMB CircularA-76, entitled ``Performance of Commercial Activities.<T3>Response: </T3>The A-76 process enhances quality and efficiency byusing competition to select the most cost-effective operation to performa service. It requires that studies be conducted to see whether work shouldbe performed by the Government or by industry. This program was formalizedin 1955 and, in 1966, the Bureau of the Budget issued the policy as CircularNo. A-76.<T3>Comment: </T3>One respondent suggested that the word ``indirectly''in section F should be removed since there already are many private trademarksearch enterprises. Another respondent suggested that the word ``encouraged''in that same section should be changed to ``allowed.'' A third respondentsaid that PTO should ``directly encourage'' the private sector by makingits data available in electronic form.<T3>Response: </T3>Section F as written expresses how the PTO will indireclyachieve its dissemination goals. No change has been made to the wording.<T3>Comment: </T3>One respondent suggested that PTO should not even consider``exclusive'' arrangements with regard to the sale of bulk data as suggestedby section H.<T3>Response: </T3>Paragraph H has been changed by deleting the word ``normally.''<T3>Comment: </T3>One respondent suggested that marginal cost recoverydescribed in section I should be limited to commercial entities seekingbulk data.<T3>Response: </T3>All costs of goods and services are fully user-fee fundedunder the terms of OMB Circular A-25, ``User Fees.''<T3>Comment: </T3>Several respondents asked for clarification of the statementthat the trademark automated system could be ready for public deploymentby September 30, 1988.<T3>Response: </T3>Under a proposed rule package entitled Patent and TrademarkAutomated Search System Fees, the PTO is proposing to provide access toT-Search.<T3>Comment: </T3>One respondent asked for clarification and more specificityto the response concerning the PTO's authority to automate PDLs.<T3>Response: </T3>Section 13 of title 35, United States Code, authorizesthe Commissioner to conduct a patent depository library program for disseminatingpatent information to the public. The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980,as amended, 44 USC, chapter 35, requires each Federal agency to ``implementapplicable government-wide * * * information policies * * * with respectto * * * dissemination of information * * and other information resourcemanagement functions * * * .'' OMB Circular A-130 establishes a Governemnt-widepolicy of disseminating Government information products and services inthe manner most cost effective for the Government. Accordingly, the PaperworkReduction Act would authorize disseminating patent information to the PDLsin some electronic form, in lieu of paper or microform, if it is the mostcost-effective mode. The authority for providing access to patent and trademarkinformation in the PDLs like that for the Patent Search Room and TrademarkSearch Library is the authority inherent in various provisions of the patentlaw other than section 13 such as section 10 of title 35. The PDLs serveas extensions of the PTO for disseminating patent and trademark informationin other geographic locations.<T3>Comment:</T3> One respondent asked that PTO adhere to Rep. Kastenmeier'sinstructions reported in 134 Cong. Rec. H9676 (daily ed. Oct. 5, 1988)(statement of Rep. Kastenmeier), to follow the letter and spirit of thecopyright law regarding nonpatent literature.<T3>Response: </T3>The PTO will adhere to the letter and the spirit ofthe copyright law as it applies to the inclusion of nonpatent literaturein the Automated Patent System.<ITAG tagnum="84">Other Considerations</ITAG>The PTO has determined that this notice is not a major rule within themeaning of section 1(b) of Executive Order 12291. Therefore, a RegulatoryAnalysis has not nor will be prepared. Because a notice of proposed rulemakingand an opportunity for public comment are not required to be given forthis amended policy statement by the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C.553(b) (A)), no initial or final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has tobe or will be prepared. The PTO also has determined that this notice hasno Federalism implications affecting the relationship between the NationalGovernment and the States as outlined in Executive Order 12612. This noticedoes not contain a collection of information requirement for purposes ofthe Paperwork Reduction Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">Electronic Data Dissemination Policies and Guidelines</ITAG>Dissemination in Government Public Search Facilities and Depository LibrariesIt is the goal of the PTO to achieve effective, widespread disseminationof information concerning patents and Federally registered trademarks toall segments of the U.S. public.A. The dissemination goal will be accomplished directly by the PTO by providingelectronic search and retrieval services to the public in search faciliteslocated in the PTO, in other facilities which may be established by theGovernment and in Patent Depository Libraries (PDLs). PDLs are Federal,State and local government, university or non-profit organization librariesdesignated by the PTO to offer public access to patent collections.B. To the extent funding is authorized and appropriated, search and retrievalservices will be provided in the PTO's search facilities and PDLs either:(1) by the PTO, using its own data bases, computers, communications equipment,and software, and/or(2) by PTO contractors.C. Access to commercial data bases that are available to the PTO's examiners,for example industry-specific data bases, will be furnished either throughan APS workstation or a terminal furnished by data base vendors in thePTO public search facilities at commercial rates, provided the user hasestablished a commercial account with the data base vendor.The PTO will not act as an agent for any data base vendor in providingtraining for, assisting in, or collecting fees for the use of such commercialdata bases.D. Services furnished in the PTO public search facilities and in PDLs willbe at no cost to the public for access to paper and microform records.The costs of accessing PTO owned electonic data bases and systems willbe recouped from user fees set to recover the marginal costs of such services.E. The type of service for public search and retrieval, either PTO or commercialservices, will be chosen based on the method and criteria established bythe 1983 revision to OMB Circular A-76, entitled ``Performance of CommercialActitivies.''Distribution of PTO Data for Commercial DisseminationF. In addition to B. and C. above, the PTO will pursue its disseminationgoal indirectly by encouraging the private sector to offer commercial patentand trademark search and retrieval services and will seek to avoid competitionwith private sector firms in providing such services to the public outsidethe PTO search facilities and PDLs. G. Fees charged for bulk data developed by the PTO will be based on themarginal cost of providing such distribution services.H. Arrangements will be non-exclusive. Bulk resale of PTO data will bepermitted subject to the terms of each bulk data sales agreement.I. Fees charged to the public for U.S. patent and trademark data productswill be based on the marginal cost of providing such products.J. The PTO will receive non-U.S. electronic patent data through exchangeagreements with other patent offices and international intergovernmentalorganizations. In general, the PTO will not distribute such data, exceptin conjunction with services that may be provided by the PTO or its contractorsin the PTO public search facilities and PDLs. Rather, it will seek to havecontractual arrangements established direcly between the organization andthe commercial data base vendor and will not act as a service agent orrepresentative unless there is a special need that cannot be met otherwise.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: March 7, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Donald J.
