Although U.S. institutions are providing the bulk of the money, Japanese institutions now are considered &quot;essential players&quot; in most U.S. takeover financings, one analyst says. Japanese banks, anxious to find high-yielding investments, are increasing their financing of the transactions, which are often highly leveraged.    &quot;The Japanese are strapped for good outlets for their money,&quot; says an official at Drexel Burnham Lambert (Asia) Ltd. &quot;When a couple of the big Japanese banks go in, everybody else comes in like sheep.&quot;    Just last week, a group of 14 Japanese banks agreed to put up $2 billion as partial financing of Philip Morris Cos.' $12.9 billion acquisition of food giant Kraft Inc. Japanese institutions, either directly or through subsidiaries in the U.S. and Europe, are expected to put up at least one-fifth of the money Philip Morris borrows for the takeover. By contrast, when Philip Morris paid $5.6 billion for General Foods Corp. three years ago, Japanese money accounted for about one-tenth.    At least three of Japan's large commercial banks were approached to participate as lead managers in a syndicated loan that buy-out specialists Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. may assemble for its $20.6 billion tender offer for RJR Nabisco Inc. Kiyonobu Shimazu, senior managing director of Shearson Lehman Hutton Asia Inc., whose U.S. head office is representing RJR Nabisco's management in a proposed $17.6 billion leveraged buy-out, says many interested Japanese investors have approached his firm.    Japanese banks are a good source of funds for takeovers. &quot;American investment and commercial banks -- they're calling us all the time,&quot; says Taira Hosaka, joint general manager of the New York branch of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd., the world's largest bank. &quot;We look at all LBOs.&quot;    So far this year, Dai-Ichi Kangyo helped finance six deals at an average underwriting of about $80 million each. That is up from total underwritings of about $200 million in 1987 and just $50 million in 1986. In April, Dai-Ichi made its big move into U.S. takeover financing by committing $500 million to back R.H. Macy andamp; Co. in its unsuccessful bid for Federated Department Stores Inc. Eventually, the bank loaned Macy's $100 million to acquire several Federated units. Generally, the bank keeps on its books at most a quarter of a loan and syndicates the rest.    &quot;Banks here are very eager to get into the nitty-gritty of U.S. corporate financing&quot; and may be funding takeovers to gain wider entre to the U.S. market, says Kenny Kano, a managing director of Manufacturers Hanover (Securities Co.) Ltd. His firm recently created a $1 billion leveraged buy-out fund and raised about half the money it will use from Japanese institutions, Mr. Kano says. U.S. investment banks have set up a number of similar funds in the past few years, and many rely heavily on Japanese money.    Substantial flows of money into Japan increased liquidity and resulted in stiffer lending competition among Japanese banks, cutting profit margins. A five-to-seven-year LBO loan is typically priced at 2 1/2 percentage points over a bank's own cost of funds, the London Interbank Offered Rate, or Libor. That compares with at best three-eighths of a point over Libor for a regular credit to a large company, bankers say.    While takeover and buy-out financing offers higher yields than traditional lending, it also carries higher risk. Repayment of such loans often is dependent on rosy economic forecasts and expectations of strong, steady cash flow. New international banking standards will force banks to keep a certain amount of capital or reserves for every dollar they lend, making lending more costly and narrowing margins further.    But some analysts are concerned that Japanese institutions are pouring more money into high-risk debt without considering the potential consequences of such deals going sour. &quot;I really wonder about Japanese quality control on this one,&quot; says Stuart Matthews, a bank analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities (Japan) Ltd.    Last week, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan warned banks to review fully the potential downside of loans to fund leveraged buy-outs. Although Japanese Finance Ministry officials are closely monitoring the level of takeover and buy-out financing emanating from Japan, they haven't sought to discourage banks from getting involved in such financing. They note that there isn't any barrier to prevent such lending, particularly by U.S. subsidiaries of Japanese financial institutions.    Banks are aware of the risks. Mr. Hosaka of Dai-Ichi Kangyo concedes he is worried about the large amount of debt some companies take on to support an LBO or acquisition. But he says that Dai-Ichi Kangyo hasn't ever lost money on a takeover-evidence, he says, of its relatively cautious approach. Dai-Ichi Kangyo generally avoids hostile deals and lending to both sides in a takeover battle, and it prefers to support only companies it knows well. Philip Morris is a longtime customer.    &quot;We're very much careful to pick out the right deals,&quot; says Hiroshi Nozaki, a specialist in leveraged buy-out funding at Long Term Credit Bank of Japan, one of the biggest lenders. But he worries that smaller Japanese banks may not be so cautious. &quot;They don't have the experience,&quot; he says. </TEXT></DOC>
