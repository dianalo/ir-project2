(Technobabble)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Richards, Kathleen.andM;</AUTHOR><DESCRIPT/><TEXT>Printer Fonts A laser printer offers a limited selection of internal fonts,which are built into its ROM.andP;  PostScript printers offer a great variety, butyou may still want to increase their font inventory.andP;  In any case, you'llneed to come to terms with the options.andM;Fonts are sets of characters with the same typeface, type size, and weight:Helvetica 12-point bold is one font, Helvetica 14-point bold is another.andP;  Thesmallest set you can buy, the ASCII character set, contains the 96 symbols,numbers, and letters on your computer keyboard.andP;  Extended character sets ofup to 256 characters include foreign-language and mathematical symbols.andM;Bit-mapped fonts hold the characteristics for each size of each letter in anindividual bitmap, or blueprint, which indicates to the printer where toplace every dot of ink.andP;  Because printers store bit-mapped fonts in memory,they are ready to use quickly and require a minimum of software instructions.andM;Font cartridges offer the simplest way to add fonts to a laser printer.andP;  Notonly are font cartridges easy to install--just plug them in--but they printfaster than soft fonts, which must be down-loaded from your PC.andO;Hewlett-packard's ProCollection font cartridge offers 65 fonts on onecartridge for $300.andP;  Beware of &quot;ultracartridges&quot; that cram more than 100fonts onto a single cartridge.andP;  Some older laser printers, such as the HPLaserJet II, are limited to a total of 168 fonts and can't take advantage ofall the fonts that are included on some ultracartridges.andM;Soft or downloadable fonts are purchased on floppy disks and installed on ahard drive.andP;  They offer greater variety than font cartridges, and if you needa font that isn't available on a cartridge, they may be your only option.andO;But soft fonts have drawbacks: they consume valuable space on a hard drive (asingle font family, which includes a variety of sizes and weights, can takeup more than 5MB of storage); they can be complicated to install; and theymust be downloaded from a PC to a printer before printing, which can be alengthy process.andP;  Soft fonts are purchased either prepackaged or as outlinefonts.andM;Prepackaged soft fonts come ready to use--you simply copy the bitmaps from afloppy onto your hard disk.andP;  Generally, these fonts offer better printquality than outline fonts do, and because you buy only the size you want,they're also cheaper.andP;  You can buy a single prepackaged font for as little as$15.andM;Outline or scalable fonts are composed of instruction sets that tell autility, known as a font generator, how to create a specific bitmap.andP;  Becauseone outline font can generate a variety of point sizes, type weights, or evenitalics, it is an economical option for someone who needs a large selectionof fonts.andP;  Unfortunately, installing outline fonts can consume inordinateamounts of time--adding ten fonts can take more than an hour.andP;  The betteroutline fonts, sold only in sets of four, cost $195.andM;PostScript fonts are outlines that are converted to bitmaps by a PostScriptprinter's interpreter.andP;  Because a PostScript printer creates fonts only whenneeded for printing, you waste less hard disk space storing ready-madebitmaps.andP;  Unfortunately, printing usually takes longer with PostScript fonts.andM;If your printing needs are fairly standard (budget reports, memos, in-housepresentations, sales reports), the resident fonts that came with your printerwill probably suffice.andP;  To increase your stock, opt for an easy-to-use fontcartridge.andP;  If you need greater variety, choose from the more than 250typefaces offered as prepackaged soft fonts.andM;If you can't find the font you need in a prepackaged version or you need touse several different point size of the same typeface, then resort to anoutline font and a font generator.andM;Desktop publishers and those who need unusual typographical effects in a pagepresentation should consider buying a PostScript printer, an expansion board,or a software-based PostScript interpreter, which will provide the mostflexibility.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
