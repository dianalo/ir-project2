(Product introduction).andO;Ticker:    SNPX.andO;Product:   LattisNet Advanced Network Management (Network managementsoftware) (Product introduction)LattisNet Basic Network Management (Network management software)(Product introduction)LattisNet Network Management for Unix (Network managementsoftware) (Product introduction)LattisNet NetMap 2.0 (Network management software) (Productintroduction).andO;Topic:     Product IntroductionNetwork Management SoftwareEthernetToken Ring Networks.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>SynOptics Communications, Inc., introduced a range of new SNMP-based networkmanagement applications for its LattisNet intelligent hubs that integrateEthernet and token-ring management.andP;  The new systems are:andM;*  LattisNet Advanced Network ManagementandM;*  LattisNet Basic Network ManagementandM;*  LattisNet Network Management for UNIX LattisNet NETMAP 2.0 Managementintelligence is added through network management modules deployed in each hubto monitor and analyze the characteristics of the data crossing the backplaneof the hub itself, as well as through many other types of modules such as thenew LattisNet Network Control Engine (NCE).andP;  The management data is processedlocally in the hub to build the information presented through the graphicuser interface at the management station.andM;SynOptics' new network management station options present network data in aconsistent way.andP;  Various network views are available through all of theseproducts, providing both static mapping capabilities which are drawn by theuser, and dynamic network representations that are provided automatically bythe network management system.andM;By way of example, LattisNet Advanced Network Management manages networkswhich may include multiple segments using differing protocols, restriction ofsections of the network for security purposes, and/or mission-criticalbusiness applications such as transaction processing.andM;Through the various network views available with LattisNet Advanced NetworkManagement, topological relationships of network elements are established,and network-wide to station-level utilization and diagnostic data ispresented.andM;Such tools as an authorized node list--which provides automatic networkcontrol--and an Ethernet address &quot;find&quot; command provide this data--all inreal time.andM;Running on a DOS platform using Windows 3.0 as its graphic user interface,LattisNet Advanced Network Management will be available during the secondquarter of 1991 at a list price of approximately $5,500.andM;LattisNet Basic Network Management is an SNMP product for small- tomedium-sized Ethernet and/or token-rirg networks.andP;  Running on a DOS platformusing Windows 3.0 as its graphic user interface, LattisNet Basic NetworkManagement is available immediately at a list price of $2,295.andM;LattisNet Network Management for UNIX can be implemented by itself on a rangeof Sun platforms, or in conjunction with the LattisNet Model 3040 NetworkControl Engine (NCE).andP;  Available in the second quarter of 1991, LattisNetNetwork Management for UNIX will be list-priced at approximately $7,000,including the cost of SunNet Manager.andM;In recognition that IBM's NetView is integral to many users' enterprisenetwork management plans, SynOptics has added token- ring management to itsN-ETMAP capability with its new version 2.0 of LattisNet N-ETMAP.andP;  WithLattisNet NF-TMAP 2.0 residing on an OS/2 station along with IBM's NetView/PCsoftware, users can manage LattisNet token-ring and Ethernet networks fromone or more NetView consoles located anywhere in the world.andM;LattisNet NETMAP 2.0 augments LattisNet Network Management applications byproviding integration of the local management information to the enterpriseIBM NetView manager.andP;  NETMAP enables IBM's NetView network management systemboth to monitor and control LattisNet token-ring and Ethernet networks downto the port level.andP;  All of the information available at any LattisNet NetworkManagement station is also available at the NetView console.andP;  LattisNetNETMAP 2.0 will be available in the second quarter of 1991 for a list priceof $2,495.andM;Information: Rene Shimada Siegel or Kristina Thorngate, SynOpticsCommunications, Inc., 4401 Great America Pkwy., P.O.
