The federal appeals court in Boston had ruled thatbuilders and developers can't sue government officials undera federal civil rights statute in disputes over permitapplications. &quot;Even where state officials have allegedlyviolated state law or administrative procedures,&quot; the appealscourt said, &quot;such violations do not ordinarily rise to thelevel of a constitutional deprivation.&quot; Other federal appealscourts have permitted such lawsuits; the high court willresolve the conflict.</LP><TEXT>   The case involves a development company's claim in alawsuit that the government of Puerto Rico violated theconstitutional guarantee of &quot;due process&quot; when officialsfailed to act on proposals for a residential and touristproject. A trial judge dismissed the suit, and the appealscourt in Boston affirmed that decision. (PFZ Properties Inc.vs. Rodriguez)   In other action yesterday, the Supreme Court declined tohear an appeal by a cable television operator that accused acity in Arkansas of violating federal antitrust law and theconstitutional guarantee of free speech. The high court letstand a lower-court ruling dismissing a suit brought by aunit of Cablevision Systems Corp. against the city ofParagould, Ark.   Cablevision had accused the city of taking unfairadvantage of municipal resources, such as public employeesand equipment, to win control of the local cable televisionmarket. Cablevision also alleged that Paragould infringed onits First Amendment right to free speech by, among otherthings, demanding a share of Cablevision's advertising fees.The company had urged the Supreme Court to revive its suit,contending that in nearly 100 communities across the country,local governments are considering building municipal cablesystems to compete against privately owned concerns.   The high court has said that state and municipalactivities generally enjoy broad immunity from federalantitrust laws. In upholding the dismissal of Cablevision'ssuit, a federal appeals court in St. Louis cited that ruleand stressed that Paragould had acted reasonably under anArkansas law allowing cities to operate cable companies. Asto the company's First Amendment claim, the appeals courtsaid Cablevision &quot;effectively bargained away some of its freespeech rights&quot; by signing a franchise agreement under whichthe city must approve of advertising and may take a portionof Cablevision's ad revenue.
