Both countries, preoccupied with domestic issues, are eager tosubmerge past hostilities but recognize the limitations of whatthey can offer each other, economically or politically.   Li's visit will be the first by a Chinese leader to the SovietUnion in 26 years. He is returning the visit of President MikhailS. Gorbachev, who came to Beijing in May 1989 for the firstChinese-Soviet summit in three decades.   He is expected to sign a trade agreement, which presumably willhave limited significance as the two countries move away fromplanned barter toward paying for goods in hard currency.   Soviet sources said the two sides also would adopt principlesfor reducing military confrontation along their 4,300-mile border,but there would be no specifics on troop withdrawals.   Trade has increased steadily since tensions began to ease in themid-1980s, and reached the equivalent of $2.8 billion last year.   That still is less than China's trade with Taiwan or SouthKorea, both anti-Communist states. Chinese trade policy is based onexporting to the West, to obtain hard currency for technology andmachinery only the West can supply.   Politically, it's a different world from 1960, when the twoCommunist giants split over ideology.   In a recent interview with Soviet reporters, Li said ``there isno perfect model for developing socialism.'' He pledged thatrelations would continue even if the Soviets ``think socialism isno longer the ideal system,'' but said he saw no signs of theSoviet Union veering from the socialist road.   Traditional suspicions have deepened in the past year, however,as the Soviet Union pursues reform while China's aging Marxists,after crushing the democracy movement, dig in for a longideological siege.   ``They don't openly criticize us,'' a Soviet official said,``but God knows what they do in private.''   It is said that senior leader Deng Xiaoping called Gorbachev a``revisionist'' in an internal report and that Chinese leaders areappalled by the Soviet Communist Party's renunciation of monopolyrule.   Analysts say longstanding differences rule out any kind ofalliance against the United States. One Western diplomat was askedabout the strategic significance of Li's trip to Moscow andresponded: ``Who the hell cares?''   Li's trip should be much smoother than the one in 1964, whenPremier Chou En-lai met with Leonid I. Brezhnev and Alexei Kosyginin Moscow.   Chou sat silently when others applauded Brezhnev's reference todetente with the West, and snubbed his hosts by laying a wreath onthe tomb of Stalin, who was still a hero in China.   Differences over Cambodia, the dismantling of communism inEastern Europe and increased Soviet contacts with Taiwan probablywill be kept private during this visit.   The Chinese premier, who studied engineering in the Soviet Unionin the 1950s and speaks some Russian, can point to real progress inrelations during the past year.   High-level party and military contacts have resumed and China'sCommunist Party newspaper soon will reopen its Moscow office, whichwas closed 30 years ago. The two countries now have 1,200 exchangestudents, compared to 10 in 1983.   Xinhua, the official Chinese news agency, said the visit willhave ``profound significance'' for peace in Asia and the world. Italso will give the two old adversaries some peace of mind so theycan tend to problems at home.</TEXT></DOC>
