Manuel A. Noriega, with theacquiescence of the Senate and House intelligence committees, anewspaper reported Thursday.   The CIA has been authorized to spend $3 million initially tosponsor a coup by recruiting Panamanian military officers or otherdissidents, the Los Angeles Times reported.   The covert operation has no restrictions beyond an orderprohibiting Noriega's assassination, and the use of U.S. troopsalong with other ``high risk'' options are under consideration, thenewspaper said.   The Times quoted an unidentified source as calling the operation``an unimpeded effort to try to topple Noriega.''   ``We're going into it with the understanding that there may beloss of life, though the effort will be not to kill anyone,'' thesource told the Times.   A White House press spokesman was not immediately available forcomment on the report.   The United States has been trying to force Noriega from powersince he was indicted on drug-trafficking charges in February 1988by federal grand juries in Miami and Tampa, Fla.   After a coup by members of the Panama Defense Forces on Oct. 3failed, congressional critics assailed the Bush Administration forits restrained response to that attempt.   Bush administration officials outlined the current operationthree weeks ago before the Senate and House intelligencecommittees, the Times said. The officials made it clear that theadministration is no longer willing to negotiate an alternativethat would allow Noriega to avoid criminal prosecution in theUnited States.</TEXT></DOC>
