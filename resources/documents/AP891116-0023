JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The ``no trespassing'' sign is out in Montana_ for the Yellowstone bison, that is.   And violators will be shot.   The National Park Service promised Wednesday to try to keep thenorthern herd of about 400 bison at Yellowstone National Park fromroaming onto Montana rangeland this winter, as state officials saidthat once again they stand ready to shoot bison that wander northof the park.   Last winter nearly 600 bison from the Yellowstone herd were shotand killed by ranchers and hunters under the eyes of Montana gamewardens, prompting an outcry from some environmentalists and animalrights organizations.   Montana officials said the ``controlled harvesting'' ofwandering bison is needed to protect ranchers, although the stateand park authorities have reached agreement on an interim bisonmanagement plan within the park.   ``Montana does not want to be viewed as being unrealistic oruncooperative,'' said K.L. Cool, the state's director of fish andwildlife, during a visit to Washington where he sought to explainthe state's policy.   ``If the bison leave the park they are fair game. ... We'refaced with a threat to our own livestock industry,'' he said. ``Theanimal is not welcomed in Montana.''   Bob Barbee, superintendent of Yellowstone National Park, whoalong with Cool met with reporters to discuss plans to deal withthe bison problem this winter, acknowledged that the northern herdhas grown too large. It is down to 400 bison from more than 900last year, but is still at least 100 animals more than what parkofficials and authorities in Montana say is manageable.   Barbee said he and state officials have agreed on developing abison management plan that would limit the northern herd to between200 and 300 animals. At those numbers it is hoped the herd could becontained to the park, he said.   But the park superintendent acknowledged that ways to reduce theherd have yet to be worked out, short of letting them roam ontoprivate rangeland and be killed. He said he has no way of assuringthat the bison now in the park will remain within its boundaries byJanuary and February.   ``Trying to herd a buffalo doesn't work. Buffalo are herdedwhere they want to go,'' said Barbee, adding that park workers hopeto influence the big animals by ``gentle hazing,'' perhaps byhelicopter.   Ranchers have complained vigorously that the buffalo that roamfrom the park damage property and threaten to infect cows withbrucellosis, a bacterial disease that causes cows to abort theircalves. Montana has struggled for years and spent an estimated $30million to rid its cattle of the disease, according to stateofficials.   Although no cases have surfaced where Montana cows have beeninfected from bison, Cool attributed that largely to efforts tokeep the bison and cows separated. Blood tests have shown that morethan half of the bison killed in the state last year had thedisease, he said.   Yellowstone has about 2,500 bison in three major herds on morethan 2.4 million acres. But ranchers are concerned only about thenorthern herd that grazes near the Montana border.   Montana officials, National Park Service officials and manyconservationists agree that the long-term answer to the bisonproblem is to control the number of buffalo in the park, so thatthey are less inclined to roam for food and better habitat.   Douglas Inkley, a wildlife resource specialist for the NationalWildlife Federation, suggests one answer might be to reintroduce anatural predator, the Rocky Mountain wolf, into the park.   Barbee was careful to stay away from that idea. Proposals toreintroduce the wolf to Yellowstone have been even morecontroversial among area ranchers than has the roaming bison.</TEXT></DOC>
