The proposed rules would require 900 &quot;pay-per-call&quot;services to give callers a short message disclosing the priceof the call and explaining the product or service offered anda brief period to hang up before billing begins. The recordedmessage, known in the industry as a &quot;kill message,&quot; drewcriticism from 900-service providers who worry thatregulators' efforts to stop consumer fraud will put thebrakes on the industry's growth.</LP><TEXT>   Under the plan, consumers would also have the option ofblocking their telephone's ability to call interstate 900numbers, and phone companies would be barred fromdisconnecting customers' basic telephone service fornonpayment of 900-number bills. Long-distance carriers wouldbe required to disclose the name, address andcustomer-service number of any 900-service provider to anycustomer who asks for the information.   The 900 industry, one of the fastest-growing segments ofthe long-distance business, is expected to top $1 billion inrevenue this year. By the end of 1992, it is projected toreach $1.6 billion. Much of the growth has come fromlegitimate operators who offer a wide range of servicesincluding sports scores, entertainment programs, stockquotes, weather data, travel information and customerassistance via telephone numbers reached by dialing numberswith a 900 prefix in place of an area code. An increasingportion, however, is coming from unscrupulous operators.   The FCC said that in recent months, it has received morethan 2,000 customer complaints about 900 services. And thisweek, a task force of state attorneys general concluded thatmisleading credit-card solicitations, phony job offers and&quot;free&quot; vacations with hidden costs offered through 900numbers are rampant and that most 900-number advertisingfails to disclose or grossly understates the price of thecall. The attorneys general suggested many of the sameremedies proposed by the FCC. The Federal Trade Commissionhas also been actively pursuing cases of potential 900-numberfraud.   While law enforcement agencies and others have supportedtough guidelines for 900 services, the Information IndustryAssociation, the largest organization representing 900services, objected strongly, particularly to a mandatory&quot;kill message.&quot;   The message will add to the cost of 900 calls and maydiscourage repeat customers who would have to listen to thesame message each time they call, said Steven Metalitz, vicepresident and counsel for the trade association. But hesuggested the kill message could be appropriate if serviceproviders use it voluntarily or if it is required to settle adispute with the Federal Trade Commission. &quot;There is a placefor a message,&quot; he said, &quot;but the trick is drawing the linecorrectly.&quot;   As part of the 900 proposal, the commission is alsoseeking public comment on related problems includingautomatic dialers that tie up consumers' telephone lines,tone-generating devices and automated collect calls.   In other action, the commission is seeking public commenton proposed rules that would curb alleged telemarketingabuses by long-distance telephone companies. The centerpieceof the proposal is an agreement reached late last yearbetween American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. and MCICommunications Corp. The FCC would like to see the agreementapply to all long-distance carriers.   To ensure that customers aren't switched to a new carrierwithout their authorization, the proposal would requirelong-distance companies to take at least one of threeactions: obtain a letter or post card from consumersauthorizing the switch; set up a toll-free number thatcustomers would call to verify their request for a newcarrier; or hire an independent auditing firm to verify newcustomers obtained through telemarketing.   The commission was swamped last year with consumercomplaints about long-distance companies switching customers,but the number of complaints has been decreasing in recentmonths. Richard Firestone, chief of the FCC's common-carrierbureau, said the problem appeared directly related to thenumber of telemarketing calls placed by the long-distancecompanies. MCI, which had received more complaints than othercarriers, revamped its telemarketing practices late lastyear.   The commission's comment period will run for 30 days, withan additional 30 days for reply comments.</TEXT></DOC>
