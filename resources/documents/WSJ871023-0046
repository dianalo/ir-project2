Karene WitcherStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 10/23/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> FREST </IN><DATELINE> SUVA, Fiji  </DATELINE><TEXT>   When Sitiveni Rabuka was commanding Fijian troops with United Nations peacekeeping forces in the Sinai during 1984 and 1985, he disobeyed an order against allowing an officer to fly home for the funeral of the officer's father. The action by then-Lt. Col. Rabuka should have been a warning to the superior who had denied the bereaved officer's request, Brig. Ratu Epeli Nailatikau.    In May, while Brig. Nailatikau was visiting Australia, Lt. Col. Rabuka (pronounced Ram-BOO-ka) seized control of Fiji in what was believed to be the South Pacific's first military coup. When subsequent political negotiations failed to satisfy him, he staged another coup late last month, named himself head of state, revoked the constitution and severed links to the Commonwealth by declaring Fiji a republic.    For the 39-year-old born-again Methodist lay preacher, his mission was no less than a holy mandate to save his fellow indigenous Fijians from extinction. &quot;I wouldn't go into it if God wasn't on my side,&quot; he told a reporter shortly after the first coup. God, he added, was the major influence in his life. Says a relative: &quot;If he was in Arabia, he'd be answering to Allah. Because he's in Fiji, it's Christ.&quot; Most native Fijians are Christians.    The coup has implications that reach beyond this archipelago of about 332 islands. For the West, it means more complicated relations with the poor island-nations surrounding Fiji. It also opens a vacuum in the region that could be filled with Soviet or Libyan influence.    For Fiji, a poor, racially divided former British colony that is being swept by a wave of Christian fundamentalism, the overthrow of democracy could spell serious trouble. Col. Rabuka has said he is willing to sacrifice the country's economy for loftier ideals of ensuring the political dominance of ethnic Fijians, who are slightly outnumbered by Indians in the population of 715,000. &quot;Economically it is heading for potential disaster,&quot; says Deryck Scarr, a historian at Australian National University.    Sitiveni (Steve) Ligamamada Rabuka, whose middle name means &quot;the gentlehanded,&quot; was born in the district of Cakaudrove in the village of Drekeniwai. He comes from a clan of bati, or warriors, who traditionally guarded a kingdom but also felt duty-bound to oust their chief if they disagreed with him.    Col. Rabuka's beliefs are the fruition of European Methodist missionaries who set foot on the shores of Fiji around 1835 to convert tribes whose life style included devouring one another.    &quot;I've got a grand vision of what Fiji will be,&quot; he says. It is a vision of &quot;the Fijian people working ever harder in their own communities and on their own little farms to be able to support themselves and also support our local industries.&quot;    Indeed, Col. Rabuka appears to want to roll back the clock to an idealized 19th-century Fiji. He declared on the radio: &quot;Our nation must regain paradise lost. And this nation will regain paradise lost.&quot;    Acquaintances say the colonel often dresses in Fiji's traditional sulu, or skirt, has a ready smile and speaks eloquently. Dawn frequently finds him on the golf course, where he has a handicap of 17.    But he is a man who won't countenance opposition. He has closed the country's newspapers, taken over the radio station and arrested trade unionists. He has established an all-night curfew and banned sporting activities, picnics, public transportation and trading on Sundays. Foreign journalists must carry press passes stamped &quot;Event: Coup 2.&quot;    The son of a primary-school teacher, Col. Rabuka says he had wanted to join the army since he was nine. &quot;It's the only thing I loved,&quot; he says. After a conventional education in Suva, he attended military schools in New Zealand and the Defense Staff College in India.    He says he first thought about a coup in 1977 but it was in India in 1979 that the idea took shape. He wrote a thesis on the role of military forces in the socioeconomic development of nations.    In April, after an election that brought a coalition government -- dominated by Indians -- to power, ending 17 years of post-independence rule by the Alliance Party, Col. Rabuka felt it was time for action. Already, he says, &quot;the economy is under {Indian} monopoly, and if they were to run our government, then we don't have anything.&quot;    Dissent had already begun growing among native Fijians. From it sprang the Taukei, or sacred owners of the soil, a national extremist group that has, on occasion, threatened to roast alive its opponents in a lovo, or barbecue pit.    Col. Rabuka appears to be firmly in the Taukei camp. The majority of the cabinet posts he announced went to people who &quot;in one way or another are associated with the Taukei,&quot; says Inoke Kubuabola, a founder of the Taukei movement and Fiji's new information minister.    Mr. Kubuabola, a devout Baptist who is considered a Taukei moderate, sums up the group's grievances: &quot;We believe this land was given to us by God. The Indians came in 1879, brought in by the British to work the sugar. They multiplied. During the wars, they didn't want to go and fight. Our Fijian men went and they stayed back to multiply and make money.&quot;    Indians retort that their forefathers weren't invaders and were given full Fiji citizenship. Abroad, Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi has lashed out at Col. Rabuka's coup, calling it a &quot;repudiation of every democratic value.&quot;    Col. Rabuka says he would like to call elections within a year. Earlier this week, two ethnic Indians joined the army-backed ruling council, pledging to restore harmony between Fiji's two main racial groups. Yet, already there is talk in Fiji's western area, the stronghold of the deposed coalition government, of secession.    The ethnic conflict is a &quot;British mess,&quot; Mr. Kubuabola says, and one that Col. Rabuka and the Taukei must sort out. Why Col. Rabuka? &quot;He is a God-appointed person,&quot; Mr. Kubuabola says. </TEXT></DOC>
