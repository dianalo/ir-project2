Theannouncement that StarKist, Bumblebee and Chicken-of-the-Seawill voluntarily stop buying tuna caught with methods thatharm dolphins is something to cheer about, not disdain.   Most U.S. tuna fishermen should benefit, not suffer as youimply, from these changes. One reason will be an increaseddemand for tuna from grounds where dolphins are not involved.Tuna swim with dolphins primarily in the Eastern TropicalPacific (ETP). Many U.S. fishermen, especially from smallfisheries on both coasts, already use technologies andmethods unrelated to dolphins. Of the 74 American tunapurse-seine vessels in the Pacific Ocean in 1988, only 28fished in the ETP and regularly exploited dolphins.</LP><TEXT>   Contrary to your assertion of the U.S. fleet's &quot;remarkableachievements&quot; in saving dolphins, the dolphin kill per U.S.vessel actually increased threefold in the decade from1977-88.   Under the dolphin-safe cannery policies, the U.S. tunafleet will not go out of business. Fishermen can adjust asthey proved in 1986 when the fleet exceeded its dolphinkillquota of 20,500 animals and was forced to abandon temporarilythe exploitation of dolphins for tuna. The U.S. is thelargest consumer of canned tuna -- nearly 55% of the worldmarket in 1988. Much of this is supplied by foreign fleetsdependent on the U.S. market. As soon as every U.S. processorsells only dolphin-safe tuna, foreign fishermen will make ita priority to use dolphin-safe technologies and methods.
