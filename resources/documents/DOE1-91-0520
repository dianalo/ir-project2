Fromthese merits, mechanical sensitivities of many high-sensitive materialswere evaluated and at the same time, properties of this tester were investigated.Sensitive explosives, benzoyl peroxide and some oxidant-red phosphorusmixtures were used as high and super-high sensitive materials and a balldrop tester in accordance with JIS was used as the tester. The resultsshow that mechanical sensitivities of high sensitive materials such asthe primary explosive and oxidant-phosphorus mixtures could be evaluatedby this tester; that the use of logarithmic scale was desirable to determinethe drop height; that both the direct and indirect methods need to beused depending on test materials; and that heavier weight and lower height,and thinner and flatter placing of a sample on the support resulted inbetter accuracy.
