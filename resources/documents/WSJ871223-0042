Sesit and Tom HermanStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/23/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> JAPAN FORGNBANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK)SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR)FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD (FED)CONGRESS (CNG) </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The addition of another Japanese securities firm to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's list of primary dealers in U.S. government securities spurred critics to point out that U.S. firms don't enjoy reciprocal privileges.    The added firm is Nikko Securities Co. International Inc., the U.S. unit of Nikko Securities Co. Also added to the dealers list were CRT Government Securities Ltd., a unit of Chicago Research andamp; Trading Group Ltd., and Lloyds Government Securities Corp., a subsidiary of Britain's Lloyds Bank PLC.    Yesterday's action, which was expected, came amid trade friction between the U.S. and Japan. Both houses of Congress have passed separate bills that would bar Japanese firms from being primary dealers until Tokyo grants full reciprocity to foreign firms in its own markets.    Japanese institutions and others have long sought the prestige associated with being primary dealers -- an elite group of institutions that deal directly with the New York Fed when it buys and sells U.S. government securities as part of its open-market operations. Membership in the group is highly prized, because some large institutional investors will do business only with firms that are primary dealers.    Yesterday's actions temporarily bring to 43 the number of primary dealers, 10 of which are foreign-owned -- four Japanese, three British, and one each from Australia, Hong Kong and Canada. The New York Fed said that E.F. Hutton andamp; Co. would cease to be a primary dealer, effective Jan. 6, because of the firm's merger with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., which also owns a primary dealer.    Rep. Charles E. Schumer (D., N.Y.), who has led the push in Congress to force Japan to open its markets more, said he would continue his push for legislation, which is part of the omnibus trade bill, that could deny Japanese institutions primary dealer status.    &quot;I see more urgency in opening Japanese markets up quickly than the Fed does; because five years from now, the shape of the new international financial structure will be more or less set,&quot; said Rep. Schumer. &quot;And if Japanese markets aren't opened during the next five years, American firms may be relegated to second-tier status.&quot;    In addition, Robert E. Linton, chairman of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., argued that &quot;there should be total reciprocity in Tokyo, and we're not there yet. So I think it is premature to allow further Japanese entry&quot; into the U.S. financial markets.    The New York Fed also said it was aware that two existing primary dealers could shortly be acquired by Japanese banks, subject to regulatory approval. In fact, yesterday primary dealer Brophy, Gestal, Knight andamp; Co. said Sanwa Bank Ltd. had agreed in principal to acquire a &quot;substantial majority&quot; stake in the firm early next year. Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. is also negotiating to acquire Greenwich Capital Markets Inc.    In a letter to Rep. Schumer, E. Gerald Corrigan, president of the New York Fed, pointed to recent steps Tokyo has taken to open its markets to foreign competitors. Mr. Corrigan also said that the growing contingent of foreign-owned primary dealers reflected the &quot;growing importance of international investor capital flows in the U.S. government securities market&quot; as well as the increased importance of the market internationally.    Mr. Corrigan also noted that the large foreign presence in the U.S. government securities market increases competition and market depth. But he conceded he had reservations about &quot;the desirability of developing undue reliance upon, or concentrations of, foreign participation.&quot;    Mr. Corrigan added that in the future the bank would continue to &quot;weigh geographic concentrations&quot; when awarding primary dealerships. He said the bank would favor firms that built a U.S. government-securities trading operation from scratch over those that acquired existing ones. </TEXT></DOC>
