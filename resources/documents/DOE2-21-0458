After demonstratingthe sensitivity of packing performance to the quality of liquid distribution,a program of controlled maldistribution studies was undertaken in a 1.2m commercial scale column. Specific results are available which providequalitative guidelines for the designers and fabricators of distributionsas well as column operators. Progress has been made in modeling the resultsso that they can be extended to other column sizes and packings. 15 references,20 figures.</TEXT></DOC>
