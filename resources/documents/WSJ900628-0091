Former House Speaker Thomas O'Neill returned, alongsidehis Boston College friend, James Dineen, a Raytheonconsultant and former lobbyist. In joking tribute, a jumbogolf club -- bought by the company's marketing division --was presented to the retired Speaker. &quot;Adds an extra 25 yardsto my drives,&quot; says Mr. O'Neill.</LP><TEXT>   The May dinner at a posh Washington hotel followed monthsof maneuvering in which the Massachusetts delegation added afew yards to Raytheon's drives as well. Facing cuts inPentagon spending, the Lexington-based company tapped all thepower of the state's liberal lawmakers, protecting itsvaluable defense contracts while buying time to pursueoverseas sales of its Hawk and Patriot surface-to-airmissiles.   The company preserved more than $40 million to continueproduction of the Hawk -- even as a senior Pentagon officialacknowledged the Army already has more than it needs. Another$248 million, cut by the Senate, was restored after twoliberal Massachusetts bulls -- House Rules Committee ChairmanJoseph Moakley, a Democrat, and Rep. Silvio Conte, theranking Republican on the House Appropriations Committee --intervened to protect a plan for co-producing the Patriotwith Italy.   &quot;Ought to be called the Conte Stallion,&quot; says the feistyRepublican.   From New England to Naples, the Italian Patriot is a studyin the pork-and-pasta politics of weapon choices in apost-Cold War world. The program also paints a portrait ofliberals going to bat for the local defense contractor --even as they call for Pentagon cuts.   The Raytheon missiles are defensive, but the aggressivetactics underscore the stakes in this year's budget wars.With fewer dollars, the bottom line is to outlast thecompetition and hope for a larger share of what remains. Oras a Raytheon executive bluntly described it: &quot;Fewer eatersof a smaller pie.&quot;   The company boasts a new, more diverse base nationally,but arms sales are ever-more important to its Massachusettsdivision. Only 16% of the workers there are nonmilitary,compared with 29% in 1979. &quot;They told me 3,200 people weregoing to hit the streets if we didn't get the Hawk money,&quot;Rep. Moakley recalls. &quot;I told them, `You fellas better learnhow to make mobile homes.'&quot;   Foreign sales offer some reprieve, but in a tight worldmarket, the Patriot project banks on close ties between theU.S. and Italy. &quot;At no time in modern history has our strongtrans-Atlantic partnership been more crucial,&quot; said PresidentBush in toasting Italian Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti inMarch. Watching at the black-tie dinner was Raytheon'spresident, Dennis Picard.   When conceived under the Reagan administration, theU.S.-Italian agreement was a model of burden-sharing andtechnology transfer between friends. But as the Soviet threathas diminished, the high costs have drawn criticism at homeand abroad. &quot;It is of very limited value,&quot; says Rep. JohnMurtha, chairman of the House Appropriations defensesubcommittee. &quot;It is a program whose time has come -- andgone.&quot;   Under the program, the U.S. must put up $500 million topay Raytheon for the most sophisticated radar and controlequipment, while an Italian consortium would be licensed toco-produce Patriot launchers and 1,280 missiles. Rome wouldgain a modern air defense and enhanced status in NATO. But itmust invest over $6 billion as part of the deal to procurenot only Patriot but also shorter-range, Italian-made airdefense systems to protect U.S. bases in Italy.   Like Washington these days, Rome may resort to its ownversion of off-budget financing. &quot;The means by which themoney will be found is not yet clear,&quot; says GiuseppeBedeschis, manager for the three Italian arms companies inConsorzio Italmissile. Special legislation is required buthas yet to be presented to parliament, even as the Pentagonhas approved a $414 million contract for Raytheon to beginwork on the U.S. share of the program.   Part of the Pentagon's eagerness may be its own desire tobuild a new Air Force base in southern Italy. Thousands ofPatriots are already deployed in Europe against a crumblingWarsaw Pact. Even though the existing Patriots are mobile,and could be shifted to confront threats from elsewhere,officials defend the new production as needed and hint darklyof the threat to Italy and NATO from Moammar Gadhafi acrossthe Mediterranean.   Raytheon Chairman Thomas Phillips speaks too of a &quot;threatfrom Libya.&quot; But in Italy this analysis weakens. &quot;Our mainthreat is not Gadhafi,&quot; says Mr. Bedeschis. Libya, in fact,was a large investor from 1976 to 1986 in Fiat S.p.A., whoseSNIA-BPD subsidiary is a partner in the Patriot program.SNIA's own history is controversial because of its allegedinvolvement in rocket projects financed by Iraq, and thoughthe company denies any wrongdoing, critics argue it hascontributed to the development of the very type of tacticalmissiles the Patriot is meant to protect against.   Building the American missile is foremost a lesson insystems engineering, says Mr. Bedeschis, but Italian defensecontractors hope for an edge too in breaking into the U.S.and foreign markets. &quot;Our armed forces are not a big enoughclient for our weapons industry,&quot; explains Italian Sen. LuigiPoli, a former Army chief-of-staff.   Selenia Industrie Elettroniche Associate S.p.A., anotherpartner in the consortium, needs work for its plant inNaples, and will gain as well from the sale of its Spadaair-defense system to the government. Contacts with U.S.lawmakers are limited, but Rep. Charles Wilson (D., Texas), amember of the House Appropriations defense subcommittee, hasbeen entertained in Rome and Washington by executives ofContraves Italiana S.p.A., whose Skyguard system would bepaired with Spada as part of the project.   For its part, Raytheon's stake could reach more than $1.2billion, counting fees from the Italian share, but the timingis crucial. The company is pursuing sales in the Mideast andSouth Korea; the Italian program is crucial to keeping downcosts because it permits the company to keep its productionlines open.   Raytheon is a skilled and proven contractor but itssuccess has fostered a certain arrogance, as when executivesspeak of the Massachusetts missile plant as a &quot;nationaltreasure.&quot; Dark clouds illustrate a glossy Patriot brochurereleased last year with the prediction that &quot;Warsaw Pact airforces will continue their qualitative growth well into thenext century.&quot; Today, without seeming to lose a step, comes amulticolored map listing the spread of tactical missiles in&quot;Third World Nations.&quot;   &quot;They are very hard-nosed,&quot; says Rep. Nicholas Mavroules(D., Mass.) of Raytheon. His seat on the House Armed ServicesCommittee has made him a valued company ally -- and arecipient of Raytheon speaking fees. &quot;We're buying them timefor a transition period.&quot;   But three weeks after the May dinner -- and days after theaward of the Italian Patriot contract -- the mood and messagewere confident at the company's annual meeting. &quot;Raytheon isnot rushing to diversify,&quot; read the headline in the nextmorning's Boston Globe.</TEXT></DOC>
