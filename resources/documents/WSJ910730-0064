Boeing's commercial-aircraft operations are soaring,thanks to marketing savvy and a boom in jet buying. Boeingnot only leads the nation in industrial exports, with acommercial backlog close to $100 billion, but consistentlyranks among the most admired corporations.</LP><TEXT>   Then there's Boeing the defense-contracting bungler. ThePentagon has canceled two major Boeing projects in the pastyear because of cost overruns and missed schedules. Boeingeven delivered Air Force One, the president's plane, late andover budget. Moreover, the military side has been humiliatedby fraud charges.   The bottom line: While Boeing's commercial-jetlinerdivision has earned more than $3 billion over the past twoyears, its defense and space operations have sustained nearly$900 million of losses. Even some Air Force brass havemarveled at the contrast and said they &quot;don't think Boeingwants to stay in&quot; the military business, says John Sheridan,head of the defense engineering group.   But Boeing isn't saying farewell to arms. Behind the75-year-old company's staid facade, executives haveengineered a restructuring designed to make the defense sideas sturdy as the commercial. &quot;I am not here to preside overthe demise of the defense and space business,&quot; declared B.Dan Pinick, chief of Boeing's military operations, in arecent letter to employees.   He has spent most of two years reorganizing his division,paring several layers of management, research labs and 10,000job slots, half of which were picked up by the commercialside. (Defense now employs 45,500 people, 29% of the workforce.) The military units no longer operate as fiefdoms withtheir own accounting, engineering and personnel departments.Employees say penny-pinching is pervasive, down to keepingthe same plastic liners in wastebaskets week after week.   But why is Boeing so committed to this course -- abalancing act attempted by only one other U.S. company,McDonnell Douglas Corp.? One reason is historical. Boeingtraces its roots back to producing wood-and-fabric planesthat the Navy bought as trainers shortly after the U.S.entered World War I. In addition, Chairman Frank Shrontzsays, a defense-commercial mix &quot;provides long-term stability&quot;and a testing ground for new technologies lacking immediatecommercial application. Financially, he notes, &quot;there havebeen times when the defense side carried the commercialbusiness.&quot;   And though it won't happen anytime soon, the defensebusiness could conceivably dominate again. Within the pastfew months, Boeing has captured pieces of two of the biggestprojects left in this era of shrinking arms budgets: the AirForce's next-generation fighter and the Army's LH advancedlight helicopter. The Pentagon also recently disclosed thatthe company is the second-source supplier for the Stealthmissile, a $15 billion program carried on in secret since1986. Just a couple of weeks ago, Boeing teamed with GrummanCorp. and Lockheed Corp. to compete for the Navy's new A-Xattack plane.   Yesterday, Boeing posted a 17% jump in second-quarterprofits, led by a strong performance from its commercialdivision. Despite some analysts' fears of softness in thebacklog, high levels of research spending on the new 777airliner and heightened competition with European rivalAirbus Industrie, net income climbed to $454 million, or$1.32 a share, from $387 million, or $1.12 a share, the yearbefore. Sales increased 12% to $7.81 billion.   But Boeing also cited &quot;lower defense and space businessoperating losses&quot; as a reason for the improved overallresults. And Mr. Shrontz said that although the companycontinues to project an operating loss for its defense andspace business in 1991, it is expected to be &quot;significantlyless&quot; than the 1990 loss.   &quot;A turnaround is definitely in place,&quot; says Michael Rosen,of Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. &quot;It's just a matter oftiming and magnitude.&quot;   The recent contract wins derive from a move by Boeing inthe 1980s to become the largest defense contractor. But thiseffort, which included a nearly successful bid for HughesAircraft Co., set off an avalanche of problems. Officialsadmit they have a way to go before the military sectorregains its health. &quot;A miracle is not going to happen,&quot; Mr.Pinick says. &quot;We can't stand around waiting for lightning tostrike. All we'll do is get wet.&quot;   In many respects, the entire defense industry is drenchedto the bone. Following the arms buildup in the Reaganadministration's early years, the Pentagon cut progresspayments to its suppliers, required more up-front corporateinvestment and locked companies into fixed-price contracts.Industry debt has grown more than 80% in five years, whileindustry earnings have slumped 45%. Boeing's case shows thedifficulties any company, even such an established andsophisticated one, can have in dealing with Uncle Sam.   &quot;I spent 10 years in commercial, and it's surprising to mehow much paper work is here,&quot; says Sarah Sidell, who now doescopper plating on Boeing's military airplanes. The Pentagon'sin-plant oversight has mushroomed -- a far cry from the trustexhibited by commercial customers.   Boeing says it takes two finance experts and threecontracting officers on a defense project for every oneassigned to a commercial program. A contracting official inthe commercial division handles $46.7 million of work,compared with only $9 million for a counterpart in defense,so complex is the Pentagon procurement system. Thegovernment's demands are &quot;crazy,&quot; says Charles Bofferding,who heads the union representing Boeing engineers.   However, many of Boeing's problems are of its own making.The company, which traditionally launches commercial-aircraftprojects only after getting a firm handle on the time andmoney involved, low-balled many Pentagon bids in the 1980sand thrust itself into areas where it had little expertise.And in what many saw as a reckless pursuit of governmentcontracts, Boeing went even further -- ending up pleadingguilty in late 1989 to trafficking in classified Pentagonplanning documents and being penalized $5 million. Lured bythe Reagan defense buildup, &quot;we pushed too hard,&quot; Mr. Pinickconcedes.   Last December, the Army canceled a contract with Boeingand Hughes Aircraft (which General Motors Corp. ultimatelybought) for a fiber-optic guided missile. It termed theteam's original $131 million bid &quot;unrealistically low.&quot; Thecompanies acknowledged they had &quot;clearly underestimated themagnitude of the job to be done.&quot;   Boeing also misjudged what it would take to build thelatest version of Air Force One. Almost 30% of thepresidential plane's wiring had to be pulled out after it wasmisinstalled, causing an 18-month delivery delay. Specialequipment complicated the job, and the project is estimatedto have exceeded budget by $385 million, all of which Boeinghas had to eat.   In the mid-1980s, Boeing took on a program to replace thealuminum wings on A-6 Navy bombers with lightweight,high-tech composites. But it had little experience with theexotic plastics, and it also apparently tried to cut cornersto meet the Navy's rigorous production schedule. The admiralrunning the program wound up chiding Boeing for &quot;poorworkmanship&quot; and called for more government auditors &quot;toeliminate questionable technical practices.&quot; The companyreplaced 10 officials and is believed to have lost severalhundred million dollars on the A-6 snafu.   Military work hasn't always been such a disaster forBoeing. During World War II, it built four-engine B-17 FlyingFortress bombers, which leveled German cities, and B-29s suchas the Enola Gay, which atom-bombed Hiroshima. Over the nextthree decades came the B-52 bomber, the Minuteman missile,the Chinook helicopter, the Awacs surveillance plane.   In the 1970s, however, Boeing missed out on some bigweapons contracts, most notably the B-1 bomber, which went toRockwell International Corp. In 1978, 1979 and 1980, Boeing'sfamily of commercial airliners brought in four of every fivedollars of corporate profit.   But by 1982, with commercial business suddenly weak andthe new 757 and 767 airliners selling poorly, 95% ofcorporate operating earnings was coming from defense, notablyfrom subcontracts on Northrop Corp.'s B-2 Stealth bomberproject. Then, in 1985, Boeing took a shot at becoming thenation's largest defense contractor, when it tried to buyHughes Aircraft from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.   After suffering a bitter loss to GM, Boeing bought themuch-smaller Argosystems Inc., a defense-electronics companyin Sunnyvale, Calif., in 1987. It paid a stiff price of $275million -- roughly three times annual sales.   In hindsight, Boeing's expansion of the defense side wasill-timed. The military budget began to flatten in themid-1980s, even before the U.S.-Soviet thaw and East Blocrevolution. Boeing, meanwhile, has turned its attention tothe biggest commercial-jet buying spree in history -- andslipped off the list of the nation's top 10 arms makers. Thecompany that once dreamed of leading the defense industry hasinstead learned, Mr. Pinick says, that &quot;the trick of successin military work is avoiding the catastrophe.&quot;   A month after the Army took away the fiber-optic-missileaward, the Air Force terminated for default part of Boeing's$1.05 billion contract to develop an upgraded &quot;Peace Shield&quot;air-defense system for Saudi Arabia. The Air Force citedBoeing's failure to deliver supplies and services within thecontract's time limits and is now seeking to recover $605million of progress payments. It had warned Boeingrepeatedly; in December 1989, two officers wrote Mr. Shrontzthat &quot;the potential exists for serious embarrassment to theUnited States and an erosion of confidence in Boeing as anindustry leader with both DOD and the internationalcommunity.&quot;   Boeing's record has been equally dismal in developing theSRAM II short-range nuclear attack missile, a $3 billionprogram now two years behind schedule. One rocket motorburned up in a test firing last summer, and Boeing hasslipped in developing computer hardware and software for themissile. &quot;It just began to snowball,&quot; says Col. Stan Boyd,the SRAM II program director for the Air Force.   Determined to improve its reputation at the Pentagon,Boeing is doing penance. It is losing &quot;several hundredmillion dollars&quot; as it fixes the SRAM II, Col. Boyd says, and&quot;nobody would lose that kind of money on a program&quot; unlessthey wanted to demonstrate &quot;their long-term commitment to thedefense business.&quot; In late May, SRAM II had a successfulrocket-motor test.   Unquestionably, Boeing's prospects in defense have nowbrightened. The recent Advanced Tactical Fighter award, onwhich Boeing is a subcontractor to Lockheed, and the LHhelicopter award to Boeing and United Technologies Corp.'sSikorsky subsidiary are potentially worth tens of billions ofdollars into the next century. They give Boeing's militarybusiness &quot;excellent long-term potential,&quot; Mr. Shrontzasserts.   Boeing's older programs also seem to be maturing well. Forexample, B-2 technicians at first underwent an expensivetrial-and-error process learning how to handle composites,which help give the bomber its radar-evading capabilities.&quot;We used to have big problems with holes,&quot; says JohnSatterlee, a factory superintendent at Boeing's vast B-2facility here. The composite wings, which are molded inpapier-mache fashion and then pressure-cooked in a giantautoclave, &quot;would splinter just like rotten wood&quot; whendrilled. Now, workers using better drills and drill blockshave reduced the error rate to less than 1%.   &quot;We all started out with our share of problems,&quot; saysOliver Boileau, the president of Northrop's B-2 division.&quot;But Boeing has recovered very well.&quot;   Gradually, Mr. Pinick's focus on the bottom line seems tobe working. He has set a goal for defense-division revenuesto exceed costs by an average of 6% between 1990 and 1996.Given last year's $418 million loss and a projected 1991deficit, the division will need profit margins of 8% or moreby 1992 to achieve his aims.   Boeing managers say lessons aren't easily borrowed fromthe commercial side, where margins top 10%. Nonetheless, oneway to improve performance &quot;is to stop using the excuse thatwe can't do things because we don't have governmentpermission,&quot; says Gary Jusela, who is helping lead aquality-improvement program.   Mr. Pinick is also trying to broaden Boeing's portfolio ofdefense work. Last week, Boeing teamed with RockwellInternational Corp. and GenCorp.'s Aerojet unit to develop areusable launch vehicle for the Strategic Defense Initiative.Boeing also is looking to build non-nuclear missiles such asthose deployed in the Gulf War, and has successfullycompleted a flight test of a Navy air-to-ground weapon it'sbuilding with Lockheed.   Defense contracting remains dicey, however. Competitiongrows tougher all the time, as evidenced by the recentannouncement by Lockheed and Grumman that they are developinga surveillance plane with the same range as that of BoeingAwacs. Congressional funding for many big programs,especially the B-2, is shaky. And the Pentagon wants to killBoeing's vertical-takeoff V-22 aircraft. Progress on somedefense contracts comes so slowly that Mr. Pinick measures itin &quot;inchstones&quot; instead of milestones.   Still, the defense chief believes the worst may finally beover. &quot;I have to be an optimist,&quot; he says, &quot;or I wouldn't bein this racket.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
