On the opening day of his confirmation hearing, Tower also saidthat he would aim for budget savings and realized the Bushadministration must ``try to achieve as much or more defense withless money.''   Tower, a Texas Republican, was chairman of the Armed ServicesCommittee from 1981-84 and led the fight in Congress to approvePresident Reagan's trillion-dollar military buildup. However, herebuffed suggestions that he might be unable to cut the Pentagonbudget.   ``I am not such a mindless hawk that I will come before you andask for increases I know you will not grant,'' Tower told thecommittee.   On the Soviet Union, Tower said he welcomed changes brought byPresident Mikhail S. Gorbachev, but he also said they did not``alter the fact that in terms of political philosophy and offensivecapability, the Soviet Union remains our greatest adversary.''   At the Pentagon, ``there is a need for reform,'' declared Tower,vowing to implement changes legislated by Congress.   He told lawmakers he had severed his ties with defensecontractors for whom he worked as a consultant over the past twoyears, and said he would appoint ``tough, aggressive'' deputies andadopt a policy of ``zero tolerance'' toward misbehavior in thePentagon.   Tower said he would review all U.S. weapons systems with theknowledge ``that difficult choices be made.''   ``Nothing is sacred,'' he said. ``There is no room in the futureof the defense budget for costly mistakes.''   ``We can't afford any more pet rocks, whether they are my petrocks, the services' pet rocks, or Congress' pet rocks,'' said Tower.   Tower declined to answer some of the toughest questions from hisformer colleagues on whether he favored purchasing major weaponssystems as the mobile Midgetman missile, the rail-based MX missile,or the B-2 stealth bomber. He said those decisions awaited review bythe new administration.   Tower's former colleagues treated him with respect, although manysaid in their introductory remarks they would quiz him fairly butfully on a range of other topics, including health, personal andprofessional matters.   Panel chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga., said the committee would bereviewing a lengthy Federal Bureau of Investigation report that hesaid was completed on Jan. 6. The time required to complete thatreview reportedly delayed Bush's nomination of Tower.   At the close of the session Wednesday, Nunn said the hearingswould resume Thursday with questions on possible conflict ofinterest involving contractors with whom Tower had acted as aconsultant. But there seeemed little doubt that Tower would beconfirmed.   On Wednesday, Nunn questioned Tower on how he planned to trimPentagon spending and what changes he would support in U.S. defenseand diplomatic policies.   ``U.S. national security strategy is currently overreaching andambiguous,'' said Nunn.   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, the Texan who was the Democratic vicepresidential nominee last fall, introduced him and said he hoped``the committee, after giving him his baptism of fire, will approvehis nomination.''   ``John Tower is too much of a conservative to give a blank checkfrom the U.S. Treasury to the Pentagon,'' said Bentsen.   Two Republican senators, Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas andPhil Gramm of Texas, also testified on Tower's behalf.   A committee liberal, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said thatwhen Tower was chairman, ``I didn't always agree with Senator Tower,but I respected him and look forward to working with him assecretary of defense.''   Tower's confirmation hearing took place in the Senate CaucusRoom, the big hall used during the Watergate and Iran-Contrahearings. Aides said that some sensitive issues might be raised insessions closed to the public.   Last month, Tower, who is 63, was hospitalized for surgery toremove a cancerous rectal polyp and later a benign polyp and a12-inch piece of his colon.   Questions linger from his personal life, as well. He was divorcedin 1987 from his second wife, Lilla, who charged that he hadcommitted ``marital misconduct.''   As the hearing got under way, Tower introduced his threedaughters, Penny, Marian and Jeanne, and his first wife, Lou, withwhom he remains on friendly terms. He declined Nunn's invitation tointroduce other friends, including Dorothy Heyser, his companion forthe past year, who sat behind Tower family members.   Tower spent 24 years in the Senate, retiring in January 1985.Shortly thereafter, he was appointed chief negotiator to armscontrol talks with the Soviets in Geneva. He quit that after 14months, and served as chairman of the presidential panel thatinvestigated the Iran-Contra affair.   One committee member, Sen. Albert Gore, D-Tenn., commended Toweron ``the hard-headed approach'' he said Tower took as a negotiator.   For the past two years, Tower has worked as a defense consultantin Washington, advising industry giants such as RockwellInternational, Martin Marietta and LTV. In 1988, Tower earned morethan $665,277 in consulting and director fees, and more than $74,000for speaking engagements, according to his financial disclosurereport. Additionally, he received $48,743 in federal pensions, therecords show.</TEXT></DOC>
