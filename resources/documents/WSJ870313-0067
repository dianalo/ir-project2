The piano bars, sleeping cars and fine dining on the company's Orient Express and other trains were legendary, and Wagons-Lits's opulent hotels stretched from Lisbon to Beijing.    Today, little remains of the Wagons-Lits legend but the evocative art-nouveau travel posters, some lovingly restored art-deco dining rooms and a sprinkling of turn-of-the-century red-velvet furniture in the company's offices here. And yesterday's splendor is unlikely to return, as the haughty grande dame of European travel moves downmarket to assure her future.    Under a new chief executive officer, 60-year-old Antoine Veil, the Franco-Belgian company -- whose full name is Cie. Internationale des Wagons-Lits andamp; du Tourisme -- has embarked on a course of consolidation, image-building and targeted growth, especially in hotels and leisure industries. Along the way, Mr. Veil has replaced most of the company's division heads, presided over a capital increase and begun a $316 million investment program.    &quot;Wagons-Lits was a sleeping old lady,&quot; says one consultant familiar with the company. &quot;But now she is waking. There is new blood coming in.&quot;    But attaining the goal of becoming a strong international conglomerate of hotels, travel agencies, catering and leisure services aimed at the middle class is far from assured. Critics say Wagons-Lits recognized industry trends too late, lacks experience in some chosen fields and suffers from its old-fashioned image.    The company itself admits to missteps, such as a fast-food joint venture that flopped, and to a certain complacency in the past. Its new management team still is struggling to wean the group away from its reliance on railway activities and on the French market.    The awakening actually began in the early 1970s, when it became obvious the railways weren't the market of the future. But in the past 18 months, Mr. Veil, who spent the 1970s as head of the independent French airline Union de Transports Aeriens, has stepped up the pace. &quot;We're going to reconcile the old image with new management,&quot; says Mr. Veil.    Wagons-Lits has strengths, including a valuable name (which sounds like vahgawn lee), more than a century of experience in the travel business and rich, institutional shareholders. The Wagons-Lits empire also is huge -- with more than 40,000 employees -- and far-flung. It has travel agencies from Paris to Asuncion, Paraguay. It provides catering in Dutch prisons and Mexican offices, operates sleeping carriages in Egypt, owns a tour operator in Italy, runs duty-free shops in Belgium and ski-lifts in France and manages or owns 183 hotels in 32 countries.    But the empire is financially fragile: In recent years, after-tax profit rarely has exceeded 1% of revenues. Vincent Mercier, a 38-year-old former Arthur D. Little consultant hired last year to map out strategy, says the group must branch out into new areas. &quot;(It) must be much more international, much more active in the English-speaking world,&quot; he says.    For now, though, he adds, Wagons-Lits should concentrate on building up its hotel and tourism divisions.    The hotel chain, estimated to be the world's 20th-largest, was recently divided into five brand &quot;images&quot; from top-of-the-line Pullman to one-star Primo. This regrouping is expected to be completed this month and Wagons-Lits is spending the equivalent of about $74 million to refurbish the properties.    Some critics suggest the change was too little, too late. &quot;They are trying to make new with old, which could be a problem,&quot; says Gerard Guibilato, a Frenchman teaching at the Cornell School of Hotel Administration in Ithaca, N.Y.    Adds a competitor from the French hotel industry: &quot;No one has seen a new Pullman hotel.&quot;    Indeed, the Pullman chain has geographical gaps in its network, with no hotels in England, only one in Spain, one in the U.S. and just a handful in West Germany. &quot;Moving from railroads to hotels, we lacked a main strategy,&quot; says Comte Jean-Pierre de Launoit, the chairman. &quot;Now we're looking to fill in the network. We bought hotels in Zurich and Frankfurt. We're looking in London, in the big cities of Spain, Switzerland and Italy. But we can't find anything.&quot;    Further, the company has no track record as a hotel chain selling management services and a global network. &quot;If I were putting up a hotel tomorrow in the heart of Africa . . . I would never think of (affiliating with) Wagons-Lits,&quot; says Alan Dean, a travel-trade publisher in Antwerp, Belgium.    The second corporate priority is to expand and strengthen Wagons-Lits's scarcely profitable tourism division, executives say. Here again, it appears the group is playing catch-up. According to the division director, Herve Gourio, &quot;our company wasn't ready and didn't jump into&quot; the tour-operator business when it began to catch on in the 1960s.    But the most pressing concern is resolution of Wagons-Lits's ambiguous relationship with Thomas Cook Group Ltd. The British travel-agency concern was a Wagons-Lits subsidiary from 1928 until World War II. Although the British government nationalized Thomas Cook after the war and later sold the company to a consortium led by Midland Bank, the two travel firms continued to cooperate.    Today they have a loose agreement to serve each other's customers and stay out of each other's territory. Together, they control 1,800 offices world-wide, with Wagons-Lits claiming the Latin world and Thomas Cook the Anglo-Saxon.    But that agreement is beginning to chafe, at least at Thomas Cook, says Trevor Davies, managing director of that company's international division. &quot;We see Europe as a major opportunity for our expansion, and our agreement causes us difficulty,&quot; he says.    Still, Wagons-Lits executives both here and in Brussels, Belgium, are optimistic. &quot;Ten years from now, the company should be more {market} segment-oriented, more professional, more international and more profitable,&quot; says Mr. Mercier, the development director.    At the same time, modernity doesn't mean Wagons-Lits will lose all its old-world charm. Asked about the company's enduring reputation as la vieille dame (the old lady), Mr. Veil, the chief executive, replies, &quot;The old-fashioned can be a plus in the new breed. And for a company that pretends to represent the European flavor, there is large room for development.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
