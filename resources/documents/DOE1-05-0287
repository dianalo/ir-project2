An increased effect of the magnetic field with respectto the reduction of the mortality rate was, however, to be observed.Thereby the influence of similar constant and pulsating fields was discussedfrom various perspectives. The question of the biological effect mechanismof the magnetic field (main issue of the influence of the magnetic fieldduring or after the irradiation) can only be answered by further comprehensiveinvestigations.</TEXT></DOC>
