Love forAmerica is palpable on Ukrainian streets, yet rarely has alove been so unrequited.   George Bush's Kiev speech of a few months ago, in which heeffectively urged Ukraine to rejoin the nonexistent union,was only a recent example of American disdain. &quot;He spoke tous like we were primitive tribesmen,&quot; recalls Ivan Drach,leader of the democratic Rukh movement. &quot;Bush despises notonly Ukraine. He is arrogant to all other nations. Hisarrogance is your problem, not mine.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   &quot;This really was a very stupid speech,&quot; says DmytroPavlychko, chairman of the Ukrainian Parliament's foreignaffairs committee. &quot;But I was happy he gave such a speech,because I knew all of America would laugh at him. He would beforced to make up for his mistake.&quot;   So far the repentence is mostly cosmetic. Mr. Bush wasexceptionally charming when Ukrainian leader Leonid Kravchuk,Mr. Pavlychko and others visited the White House Sept. 21,but at the same time the administration was giving $211million in export credits to the Soviet center.   In late October, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State ThomasNiles went to Capitol Hill and emphasized that the trendtoward independence was reversible. The same day, U.S.Ambassador Robert Strauss echoed the theme by saying that&quot;like teen-agers,&quot; the republics would retreat back &quot;home&quot;when they found out how tough the real world is.   On Oct. 30, Undersecretary of State Robert Zoellickacknowledged that &quot;power has shifted almost completely to therepublics,&quot; but this was only a day after George Bush went toMadrid and said that the coup hadn't altered relations withthe central Gorbachev government. On bad days, theadministration has an anti-Ukrainian policy; on good days, itis wait-and-see -- that is, no policy at all.   In Ukraine itself, independence is a foregone conclusion.On Dec. 1, more than 70% of Ukrainians will support anindependence referendum -- including a clear majority of therepublic's Russian citizens -- if all the polls are to bebelieved. Ironically, with the Soviet central government ashambles, there is nothing left to declare independence from.&quot;I don't think about Russia anymore. Russia is like China tome, a foreign country. I think in terms of Ukraine,&quot; saysUkrainian activist Volodimir Musinko.   Starting with Lithuania, the Bush administration hasalways erred on the side of shabbiness, siding with thecenter against republican democrats. In Ukraine, the U.S.says it supports democratic principles, but it remains coollyaloof while the Ukrainians struggle to create them.   It is a struggle, because Ukraine has had few contactswith the West. The Bush policy grows out of a tradition ofWestern journalists who thought that covering the SovietUnion meant covering the Kremlin; of Sovietologists whofocused on the nomenklatura; of government officials whodeveloped contacts with central Soviet officials who are nowirrelevant to real reform; and of foundations that even nowcenter their work on Moscow and St. Petersburg (a notableexception are George Soros's foundations).   About 40,000 foreigners are living in Moscow, but only 500in the Ukraine -- of whom only 75 are Americans. There aremore than 3,000 joint ventures in the Soviet Union, of whichonly 120 are based among Ukraine's 52 million citizens. Thereare a plethora of Jewish organizations in Moscow, but upuntil recently only one served Kiev's 120,000 Jews.   As a result of lack of contact with the West, the level ofunderstanding of Western-style institutions is abysmal.Serhij Holowaty, a parliamentarian writing the Ukrainianconstitution, says: &quot;The professional skills of ourparliamentarians are very low. It is very difficult to conveythe elementary notions of democracy. That's why I am verypessimistic about the future of the constitution. The lack ofcontacts with the West hurts our work. Western experts wentto Moscow to educate the center. Those efforts were all invain.&quot;   Earlier this month, Ukraine signed a contract to print anindependent currency, but local understanding of centralbanking is primitive. Volodimyr Musinko is working from sixin the morning until midnight to rush into print atranslation of an American finance textbook, inventingUkrainian words for concepts such as earnings per share:&quot;None of the parliamentarians know anything aboutprivatization, or about finance. Very few of our economicsprofessors know anything about this.&quot;   The U.S. has had two diplomats working in Kiev from anapartment building on the far side of town. They are reveredin Ukraine for their energy and understanding of thesituation. But, according to Ukrainians, their dispatcheswere filtered through Moscow and the State Departmentbureaucracy. &quot;The American bureaucracy, like mine, seesUkraine as an annoyance,&quot; says one Western diplomat here.There is also the tendency to see things through Russianeyes.   Vladimir Averchev is a Russian democrat who has been partof Yeltsin delegations to Ukraine: &quot;Ukrainians have noexperience in building responsible government. They may havea strong inclination to follow a medieval structure, with astrong state. Russia cannot allow this. We have sent hints tothe West to this effect, and they have been understood.&quot;   Mr. Averchev's evaluation of the Ukrainian situation isabsurd. Ukraine has its problems. The Ukrainians are going totry to build a paternalist welfare state that they cannotafford; no one has enough economic understanding to evenevaluate the costs of the industrial subsidies they envision.But medieval authoritarianism is the opposite of theirproblem.   There is a haphazard Velvet Revolution atmosphere ingovernment circles here. Mr. Pavlychko, the foreign affairschairman, was translating Shakespearean sonnets as I enteredfor an interview. The leaders of Rukh sat in the back of aKravchuk press conference earlier this month, giving arunning commentary as Mr. Kravchuk held forth (on his passionfor the theater, among other things). &quot;Taras Shevchenko isour Jesus Christ,&quot; said Rukh's Mr. Drach of the Ukrainianpoet.   Mr. Kravchuk himself is a politician's politician. Theformer ideology spokesman of the Communist Party now hasusurped 90% of the Rukh platform. He almost certainly willwin the presidential election, though perhaps only after arunoff. The Rukh candidate, Vyacheslav Chornovil, who servedin prison for nationalist activities, would move moredramatically. But a surprising number of democratic activistsadmit that Mr. Kravchuk's methodsslyly, two steps forward,one step backare best. Many voters also feel Mr. Kravchukwould be more attentive to preserving trade relations withRussia.   Mr. Chornovil would bring in a staff of poets andintellectuals. Mr. Kravchuk, a staff of ex-communistconformists. Neither would be well prepared for the tougheconomic reforms that lie ahead. But even the formercommunists show no sign of authoritarianism or crudenationalism.   &quot;I hesitate to even call them nationalists, because thathas negative connotations,&quot; says Rabbi Yaakov Bleich, anAmerican who has spent the past two years leading Kiev'sbustling synagogue. &quot;Ukrainian nationalists are notanti-Semitic, or anti-Russian, or anti-anybody else.Whichever side wins the election, we will have good relationswith them.&quot;   Shortly after the Dec. 1 vote, Hungary, Poland,Czechoslovakia and perhaps Canada (which has a largeUkrainian population) will recognize independent Ukraine. Butthe U.S. will wait to see if the government passes JamesBaker's democracy test (which would be interesting if appliedto Syria). The U.S. will also wait to see if Russiarecognizes Ukraine, though the U.S. doesn't even recognizeRussia.   In one sense, President Bush's Kiev speech was useful.&quot;The Ukrainians learned that the West was not going to helpthem,&quot; says Bohdan Krawchenko, member of the advisory councilto the Ukrainian Parliament. But out on the city's centralsquare last week, an old Russified Ukrainian woman came up toan American reporter. With tears of rage streaming down herface, she described the indignities inflicted by Soviet rule.But she brightened and said she was so happy to meet herfirst American. No matter what we Americans do, theUkrainians will love us.   ---   Mr. Brooks is deputy editorial page editor of The WallStreet Journal Europe.</TEXT></DOC>
