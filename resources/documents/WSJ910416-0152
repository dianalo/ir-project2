From Nanuet, N.Y., to Coldwater, Kan., to Saratoga,Calif., small banks are losing some of their biggest depositsbecause of the proposals being considered in Washington tolimit the scope of deposit insurance. Though the fate ofthese proposals is far from clear, even the chance of changeis prompting many businesses and individuals to reduce theamount of deposits they are holding beyond the current$100,000-per-account ceiling.</LP><TEXT>   Some small banks say the departure of their largestdeposits is crimping their ability to make loans -- and, as aresult, hindering the economic recovery. Richard Mount, thepresident of Saratoga National Bank, Saratoga, Calif., sayslarge withdrawals are making it increasingly difficult foreven well-capitalized small banks to participate in loans.Rep. Willis Gradison (R., Ohio) worries about a &quot;silent run&quot;on deposits.   The school district in Liberty, Ill., recently reduced its$1 million balance in the tiny Farmers Bank of Liberty byabout $300,000. Hobson Bale, the school superintendent, sayshe had no fears about the bank, but &quot;we started getting alittle bit concerned&quot; about leaving so much uninsured moneyin any one bank. Although the state school board associationhas started a liquid-assets fund for its members, Mr. Baledecided to spread his risk among several area banks.   But the withdrawal hurt Farmers Bank, which counts fewaccounts of more than $100,000 among its $11.5 million indeposits. &quot;We've had to curtail our mortgage lending,&quot; saysMark Field, the bank's president.   The Bush administration believes that the expansion ofdeposit insurance has insulated depositors and bank managersfrom market discipline. Currently, it's possible for onedepositor to have six insured accounts in the same bank. TheTreasury has proposed to limit coverage to two insuredaccounts per depositor in each bank. Eventually, it wouldlike to limit systemwide coverage for any one person to$200,000, half of which would cover a retirement account.   According to Federal Reserve Board data, only 3.5% of thenation's households have deposits of more than $100,000 atany one insured depository institution. But these householdsaccount for 24% of all deposits, and many of these depositorsare from politically powerful groups -- elderly people whohave sold houses, small businesses and farmers. Already, theAmerican Association of Retired Persons has joined thepolitically potent Independent Bankers Association, whichrepresents thousands of small banks, in campaigning againstlimits on deposit insurance.   Fed Governor John LaWare says a majority of the boardsupports the Treasury's proposal and &quot;believes it isn't anissue that should affect the average consumer.&quot; Almost 60% ofthe households with aggregate deposits of more than $100,000at one institution still would be covered under theTreasury's proposal, he says; extending insurance beyond thatwould mostly just safeguard the wealthy, who have &quot;littleneed for the protection of a safety net.&quot;   In general, small banks are better capitalized and moreprofitable, as a percentage of assets, than larger banks.Many small banks are aggressively touting their financialstrength to counter deposit erosion. In Kansas, ColdwaterNational Bank is running newspaper ads featuring itsfive-star rating from a bank reporting service.   Banking regulators acknowledge that the banking proposalsare causing jitters. &quot;Clearly, funds are moving out of thebanking system,&quot; says L. William Seidman, chairman of theFederal Desposit Insurance Corp. &quot;They're moving into moneyfunds; they're moving into Treasuries, and they are movinginto mattresses. There is a loss of confidence out there thatis very worrisome. It can have an effect on bank lendingability.&quot;   To be sure, this frayed confidence -- fueled by regularreports of newly failed banks and the shrinking towardinsolvency of the FDIC's bank-deposit insurance fund -- isaffecting big banks as well as small ones. But the smallbanks say they are uniquely vulnerable. For one thing, theymay find it more difficult to replace large deposits. Foranother, they fear that Congress will trim insurance coveragewithout changing the current practice of protectingdepositors in large banks from loss. This so-calledtoo-big-to-fail policy effectively insures all deposits atthese institutions, even those outside the umbrella offederal coverage.   &quot;A cutback in insurance no matter how you do it, coupledwith the too-big-to-fail doctrine, is a formula for peopleleaving the reduced-insurance banks and going to the banksdeclared `never to fail,'&quot; warns Richard Loundy, chairman ofDevon Bank, a Chicago institution with deposits of $182million. With deposits migrating to big banks from smallones, he argues, &quot;the whole country will look like Swisscheese.&quot;   More than 9,000 of the country's 12,300 banks areclassified as small, with deposits of less than $100 million.&quot;What people don't realize is that without us the economyisn't going to move,&quot; says Tom Hales, chairman of Union StateBank, Nanuet, N.Y. &quot;The small-business man has got to dealwith banks like us. The big guys aren't going to lend him$50,000.&quot;   Mr. Hales says he recently lost one of his largestdeposits when a local insurance agency reduced to $200,000from $1 million the balance in an account used to holdpremiums before they are remitted to insurance companies. Thefirm acted after the Professional Insurance Agents of NewYork informed members that an agent had suffered large lossesof fiduciary accounts above the $100,000 insurance ceilingwhen Freedom National Bank in Harlem failed last year.   Iowa Republican Rep. Jim Leach, a member of the BankingCommittee, says Congress has two options for limiting thepotential taxpayer liability for deposit insurance. &quot;One isto decrease coverage and the second is to increasestandards,&quot; he says. &quot;My own personal view is to increasestandards. If you have strong capital and responsiblepremiums for deposit insurance, there is no great danger tothe taxpayer.&quot;   Federal Reserve Board Governor Wayne Angell argues thatsuch an approach makes more sense than just limiting coveragein a way that would force depositors to evaluate the safetyof banks they use. &quot;I wouldn't want the TransportationDepartment to put up signs at every bridge saying, `Cross atyour own risk,'&quot; he says. &quot;Similarly, I am uncomfortable withthe idea of asking bank depositors to bank at their ownrisk.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
