The results may form the basis for futurefield testing and any necessary modifications of the recommended drifter(s).Drifters may then be procured to be used in deployments in Outer ContinentalShelf lease areas where complex, near-shore circulation features exist,or where there exists significant probability of oil contacting importantcoastal resources. Automated searches were applied to several computerdata bases. Requests for information were also sent to over 70 membersof the international oil spill research community. The resulting informationwas synthesized with a focus on advances of surface drift of oil slicks.A detailed list of specifications for an ideal oil spill tracking drifterwas provided. Candidate drifters were identified and subjected to a setof selection criteria to arrive at a final recommendation. 65 refs.,2 figs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
