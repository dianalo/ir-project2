After the U.S. government learned of the meeting, Secretary ofState George Shultz told Syria that the expert, Paul Jureidini, inno way represented the government, the program reported. Shultz alsotold Jureidini to end any such contacts.   A spokesman for Vice President Bush, Mark Goodin, denied thatJureidini's meeting was in any way sanctioned by the campaign. Aslate as July, Jureidini served as an unpaid consultant on the MiddleEast to the campaign, ``Nightline'' said.   Jureidini, who has been a frequent Pentagon consultant and hastop-level U.S. security clearance, said on the program that he toldhis Syrian hosts during the meeting in Damascus that he was actingon his own. Joining Jureidini at the meeting was his partner, RonaldMcLaurin.   ``Nightline,'' quoting Syrian sources, reported that during theAug. 16 meeting, Jureidini and his hosts discussed options forsecuring the release of the nine American hostages and what theimpact of any such release would be on the U.S. presidentialelection.   ``Nightline'' also reported that the release last month ofhostage Mithileshwar Singh, an Indian professor who is a legalresident of the United States, followed third-party contacts betweenthe United States and Iran.   The program said the intermediary was West German ForeignMinister Hans-Dietrich Genscher. Through this channel, Shultz toldIran that the U.S. hostages must be freed if there is to be realprogress in improving U.S.-Iranian relations.   Following this contact, substantial pressure was exerted on theHezbollah, the radical group in Lebanon believed to be holding thehostages, ``Nightline'' reported. That pressure led to Singh'srelease, it said.   Following his release, the U.S. government sent word to Iran viathe Japanese government that all the U.S. hostages must be released,and that there would be no deal and no negotiations, ``Nightline''reported.   Iranian officials said that response was an insult; that Iran wasnot trying to make a deal, only start a process that would lead tothe release of the other hostages, the program reported.   From the Iranian perpective, the Singh release was a gesture thatcould have led to more releases, ``Nightline'' said. But the U.S.response, in the Iranian view, resulted in the door slamming shut,it reported.   U.S. officials told the program that the response was consistentwith U.S. policy on the hostages.   ``Nightline'' reported that the West German contact was just oneof many such contacts regarding the hostages between Iranianofficials and people who claimed to represent either the U.S.government or the presidential campaigns of Bush or Michael Dukakis.   Spokesmen for both campaigns denied they had authorized any suchcontacts.   The number of such contacts was so great that in October, theIranian government complained in an official message to the U.S.government, ``Nightline'' reported. Iran refused to provide thenames of those it claims made such contacts, the show reported.   In early October, Shultz announced that such contacts wereunauthorized and that those making them should ``butt out'' and letthe State Department handle the hostage situation.</TEXT></DOC>
