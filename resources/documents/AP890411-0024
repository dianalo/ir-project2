U.S. District Judge Dickran Tevrizian scheduled a pretrialhearing Sept. 11 and trial Oct. 17 unless Dangerfield and Park InnsInc. of Dallas can settle their differences. Dangerfield alleges animpersonator illegally mimicked his voice on a radio commercial.   ``The case poses the question of whether someone can do a satireof a famous person and get the benefit of something someone hasspent their whole life developing,'' said John Lavely, theentertainer's lawyer.   Dangerfield, he said, has spent a lifetime developing a uniquevoice, style and remarks such as, ``I can't get no respect.''
