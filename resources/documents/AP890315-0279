DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Commuters have once again been spared thenightmare of a railroad workers' walkout as a federal judge decidedto continue his ban against honoring the picket lines of EasternAirlines strikers.   But union leaders said they plan to appeal the court order,possibly as soon as today.   ``I have little doubt that it will be appealed,'' said SheldonEngelhard, attorney for the Machinists union, which struck Easternon March 4.   U.S. District Judge Robert P. Patterson Jr. said there is ``aclear risk of immediate and irreparable injury'' to four arearailroads and the riding public if railroad unions are allowed tostrike in sympathy with Eastern workers.   Patterson's 34-page opinion signed late Monday and releasedTuesday morning will give the railroads the injunction they soughtagainst sympathy strikes.   The judge noted that both sides agree all four rail lines _ theLong Island Rail Road, Metro-North Commuter Railroad, New JerseyTransit Rail Operations and Amtrak _ will have to shut down if theirunionized workers honor Eastern strikers' picket lines.   In addition to the economic losses such sympathy strikes wouldcause the railroads, ``the public, over 400,000 persons, will sufferimmediate and irreparable injury, both in substantial inconvenienceand in loss of pay by those unable to get to work,'' Patterson found.   He conceded that an injunction would deny the unions anopportunity to express union solidarity but he said the harm theywould suffer ``is far less'' than that faced by the railroads andpublic in the event of a walkout.   Patterson said his preliminary injunction, to be issued laterthis week, will prevent the rail workers unions from engaging in``sympathy strikes, slowdowns or other concerted labor activity inconnection with any picketing of plaintiffs by striking EasternMachinists.''   In the meantime, a temporary restraining order against sympathystrikes remains in place.   ``Judge Patterson's decision protects hundreds of thousands ofrail commuters from becoming hostages in a labor dispute that istotally unrelated to the MTA. It would have been absurd for thecustomers of Metro-North and the LIRR to pay the price for a strikeat Eastern Airlines,'' said Metropolitan Transportation AuthorityChairman Robert Kiley.   But William Wintisinger, president of the IAM, said in astatement issued by the union that Patterson's ruling ``clearlyoversteps his authority.''   The statement continued: ``When the judge stated that hisdecision was based on a `clear risk of immediate irreparable injuryto three area railroads and the public' he made a decision that onlythe president of the United States is authorized to make.''   The statement explained that under the Railway Labor Act, thepresident may appoint an emergency board and temporarily end thedispute for 60 days.   Patterson issued a temporary restraining order March 5, barringworkers at the LIRR, Metro-North and NJ Transit from honoringEastern strikers' picket lines. Amtrak workers were added to theorder a day later.   Patterson, who has only been on the federal bench for about threemonths, conducted two days of hearings at federal court in Manhattanon the issue.   The unions claimed that federal labor law barred a federal judgefrom intervening in such a dispute.   Patterson said he would require the rail unions to instruct theirmembers ``to report for work'' because some unions have alwayshonored picket lines without specific instructions from theirleaders.   But James Phelan, general chairman of the United TransportationUnion's Metro-North local, said: ``My union's constitution talksabout picket sites as being dangerous places and the UTU intends todefend its members' rights to avoid confrontations and othervolatile situations such as picket lines.   ``We, the UTU, did not encourage or endorse sympathetic action,so that was not an issue for us,'' Phelan said.   If the machinists put up a picket line at Metro-North, Phelansaid he would encourage his members ``to run the other way.''</TEXT></DOC>
