The amount wasn't disclosed.    The electronics maker and retailer previously estimated the sale price at between $100 million and $200 million for Datatronic's Victor microcomputer and Micronic hand-held computer subsidiaries. In addition, Tandy will acquire rights to the Victor and Micronic names for computers. During 1988, the Datatronic subsidiaries had combined sales in excess of $200 million.    The transaction will give Tandy a well-known European computer brand that includes 2,700 dealers and distributors marketing to medium-sized business and educational institutions.    Closing of the transaction is subject to certain conditions and regulatory approvals, the company said. </TEXT></DOC>
