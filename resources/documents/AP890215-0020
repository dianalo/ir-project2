Some say they think the deep probing that goes on inside andoutside Senate confirmation hearings in Washington may be harmful inthe long run.   Such proceedings are virtually unknown in Western Europe, whereCabinet ministers by and large are chosen from the ranks of loyalparty troopers who over the years have worked their way to the top.   Any serious scrutiny nearly always comes after the fact.   The difference is one of system of government. But it is alsocultural. In most European countries, a politician's private life issacrosanct. Except for the most extreme cases, personal foibles areconsidered irrelevant to professional abilities.   Tower's nomination is on hold while the FBI investigatesallegations about his drinking, womanizing and financial ties withmilitary contractors.   ``The confirmation process in the United States is not very wellunderstood in Europe,'' said Dominique Moisi of the FrenchInsititute for International Relations. ``In France, when thepresident of the republic asks his premier to choose a defenseminister, the Parliament has no say in the matter.''   The president of France selects his premier from the majorityparty in the National Assembly. The premier proposes a Cabinet tothe president, who has final say and makes the officialappointments. Ministers are nearly all known political faces, withthe occasional specialist thrown in.   The French government as a whole can be voted out of office byParliament, but there is no individual confirmation process.   That is generally the case throughout Western Europe.   ``What's worrying about the entire American system is that theway the press, now with the cooperation of Congress, is going withthese inquiries, it is going to be very hard to find people of realability to go into public life,'' said Anthony Barnes, a lecturer ingovernment at the London School of Economics.   In Britain, the prime minister chooses the Cabinet, whose membersmust also be legislators, and in practice all are members of thegoverning party. There are no hearings, though MI5, the Britishsecret service, is widely believed to run checks on most members ofParliament.   ``The aggression on the private lives of individuals is pushedtoo far in the United States,'' said Moisi. ``The sexuality of ourpoliticians, except in the most extreme cases, is never discussed inpublic. The number of politicians with mistresses is numerous, butnever discussed. There is a sort of self-censorship.''   Indeed, the peccadillos of some extremely high-ranking Frenchpolitical figures are widely known but rarely mentioned publicly.   At the time of the great brouhaha over Gary Hart's relationshipwith Donna Rice, the big joke in Paris was that the French were notat all shocked by the fact that Hart, a Democratic presidentialhopeful, spent the night with a woman. What disturbed them was hesaid afterward that nothing happened.   ``Typically American,'' Rome's La Repubblica newspaper said ofthe Tower hearings, ``so full of ... puritanical echoes but inreality dense with precise political intentions. Tower is thesacrificial victim.''   Wrote the Washington correspondent of the Paris' Le Monde: ``Evenif Mr. Tower finally is confirmed, he will arrive at the Pentagon ina pitiful state.''   Italy's Cabinet ministers ostensibly are named by the premier,who is named by the president, but in reality, the parties negotiateCabinet spots during coalition-building.   West Germany's ministers are selected by the chancellor andapproved by the president and the president of the Parliament, butthere are no hearings and no vote by Parliament.   A West German government spokesman, Ulrich Strempel, said whilebackground and security checks are routinely made the selectionprocess ``is nothing like the unique system practiced in the UnitedStates. But that doesn't mean some embarrassing details can't cometo light later that could spell a swift end to a ministerialcareer.''   Britain's Barnes said: ``To assess presidential choice forintegrity seems quite reasonable. But the pursuit of every kind oftittle tattle about a man's sex life or the fact that he's been seenwith a drink in his hand seems to be carrying the process too far.   ``No system is immune to corruption, but I'm not sure that acorrupt appointee is more or less likely to be exposed in the UnitedStates than here.''</TEXT></DOC>
