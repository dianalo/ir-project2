That's why thenewcomers here have everybody talking.   Last week, the U.S. Census Bureau unveiled its 1990population count for Caswell. It's 2,743 -- a 368% leap fromthe last count of 586 in 1980.</LP><TEXT>   The trouble is, nobody in Caswell has seen the outsiders.   &quot;I've lived here all my life. I know pretty much everybodyin town. . . . It's gotta be a computer mistake,&quot; saysFrederick St. Pierre, chairman of the Board of Selectmen.Adds his cousin, Town Clerk Doris St. Pierre, &quot;We have alittle over 400 people who live here now,&quot; about a 32% dropfrom the last census.   Folks are leaving this one-horse town for lack of jobs --other than potato farming or work at a nearby Air Force base.In a town with no high school, police station or bowlingalley, what in the world, townsfolk query, would 2,000 newresidents do for a living? &quot;I honestly don't know where we'dput them all,&quot; says Ms. St. Pierre.   But while Caswell residents are laughing it up, the CensusBureau isn't budging. &quot;Until we investigate it, we don't knowthere is an error,&quot; says Edwin Wagner Jr., a Census Bureauofficer, who refuses to call the figure an overcount.&quot;Obviously, we have what appears to be a discrepancy.&quot;   Discrepancies like these have led to lawsuits in placesmuch bigger, where the complaints have been about anundercount, not an overcount. Two years ago, even before the1990 census began, five major cities -- including New York,Los Angeles and Chicago -- filed suit against the Departmentof Commerce, which oversees the Census Bureau, seeking achange in procedures that led to alleged undercounting in the1980 census.   Many of these cities, including New York, have alsoclaimed an undercount in the 1990 census. New York says itspopulation is 7.8 million, but the census count was 7.3million last year.   &quot;What (Caswell) has pointed out is an extraordinarilyserious problem&quot; of both undercounting and overcounting, saysPeter L. Zimroth, an attorney representing New York in thelawsuit.   The Census Bureau takes the low ground in all this. WhileMr. Wagner acknowledges that mistakes have been made in pastcensuses, he says more often it's a case of folks&quot;misinterpreting&quot; what jurisdiction census figures reallyrepresent.</TEXT></DOC>
