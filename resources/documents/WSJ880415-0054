The 63-27 vote to slash foreign aid to the Mexican government -- despite strong objections from the White House and Justice Department -- is an important symbolic defeat for the Reagan administration's international drug-control efforts.    The administration has expended considerable political capital over the years to block such congressional action on grounds that it would alienate the most important ally the U.S. has in Latin America. But escalating election-year concern in the U.S. over the drug issue combined with recent allegations of corruption against Latin American officials prompted yesterday's overwhelming vote.    The measure faces an uphill battle because of strong opposition against it in the House and continuing administration claims that sanctions would be counterproductive. </TEXT></DOC>
