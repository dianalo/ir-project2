In Austria, the Interior Ministry said 12,158 East Germans hadpassed through that country en route to West Germany in the two daysthat refugees have been taking advantage of Hungary's newly openedborder.   In Budapest, a government official said today that Hungary has nointention of reversing its dramatic new pathway to the West and thatit reflects the increasingly liberal Communist nation's new role inthe world.   ``The Hungarian government's policy of opening the country'sborders will continue,'' said Ferenc Somogyi, the No. 2 official inthe Foreign Ministry.   He said that as long as a third country is willing to acceptrefugees from other East bloc countries, Hungary will allow them toleave.   But he said that the current, orchestrated migration was a``unique step'' that applied only to East German citizens. ``TheEast Germans were not treated as refugees and they did not requestasylum as refugees,'' Somogyi said.   East Germans are automatically considered citizens of WestGermany and therefore technically do not qualify as refugees.   Somogyi said the country's open-border policy was consistent withHungary's status as a signatory of the U.N. Convention on Refugees,the only East bloc country to have signed it.   He indicated that such agreements with the West take precedenceover Warsaw Pact commitments Hungary, by allowing citizens of aWarsaw Pact ally to flee across its borders, violated a 1969 pactwith the rest of the Soviet bloc.   ``There are agreements with other Warsaw Treaty countries similarto the one Hungary just suspended with East Germany, and theseagreements are no longer in line with Hungary's newly assumedinternational responsibilities, such as our having signed the GenevaConvention,'' Somogyi said.   ``We are working to bring these various agreements into harmonywith (our) new foreign policy,'' he added.   In East Berlin, the Communist Party youth daily Junge Welt saidthat East German citizens no longer can avoid the discussion aboutwhy a ``minority'' has fled the country of 16.6 million people.   ``How do we make this country indisputably the focal point fordedication and happiness for every individual? How do we make it ahomeland for even more people in which one accepts burdens and fromwhich one is not lured away just by shop windows full of bananas orglossy travel guides?'' Junge Welt asked.   The newspaper often contains important articles and commentariesreflecting official views.   The new arrivals have said they were dissatisfied with theeconomic situation in their country, and the political oppression athome. Many of the arrivals are young, skilled craftsmen. They alsosaid East Germany has failed to adopt political and economic reformsbeing tried in other Communist nations.   The main East German party daily, Neues Deutschland, todaycontinued its criticism of West Germany, which it contends has``lured the refugees West.''   It also criticized Hungary for allowing their ``unsanctioneddeparture.''   The refugees have traveled by car, train and bus through Austriato their new homeland since midnight Sunday, when Hungary opened itsborder completely.   West German border officials said the number of refugees couldtop 15,000.   The exodus comes at a time of dramatic change in the East bloc.Poland has installed the bloc's first government led bynon-Communists, and Hungary's leaders are promising free elections.   West Germany and Hungary have worked together to coordinate freepassage for the East Germans and that has added to the strain inrelations between those countries and East Berlin.   It is the first time an East bloc nation has assisted in anexodus to the West of citizens from a Warsaw Pact ally.   On Tuesday, Yegor Ligachev, a hard-line member of the SovietPolitburo, arrived in East Berlin and accused West Germany of``slander, enticement and luring away'' East Germans.   East German leader Erich Honecker's prolonged recovery from gallbladder surgery has complicated the situation. Communist Partyofficials acknowledge that decision-making in East Berlin isvirtually paralyzed.   East Germany's state-run news agency, ADN, said Tuesday thegovernment issued a formal protest to Hungary for its decision to``unilaterally suspend'' parts of bilateral agreements on bordercontrols, ADN said.   An estimated 50,000 East Germans were reported in Hungary Tuesdayon tourist visas, which have traditionally been relatively easy toobtain.   However, sources say East Germany police offices are now turningdown many more applications for tourist visas to Hungary than theyare approving. The sources say the offices are filled daily withapplicants.   Some unofficial estimates say 1 million of East Germany's 16.6million people desire to emigrate to the West. About 100,000 areexpected to emigrate to the West this year, the largest number since207,000 fled in 1961, the year the Berlin Wall was built.   At a crowded tent city in Tiefenbach, West Germany, bulletinboards with scores of job notices have been set up. East Germans Uweand Norma Koenig scanned a bulletin board on Tuesday and said theywill take their time deciding.   ``The East German government told us for years what we could andcould not do,'' said Mrs. Koenig. ``Now we're going to do what'sbest for us.''   Romania and Czechoslovakia, which like East Germany have resistedreforms being carried out in Hungary and Poland, criticized WestGermany but were restrained in their criticism of Budapest.   In Czechoslvakia, more than half of the 400 East Germans who hadcamped outside the West German Embassy in Prague gave up Tuesday ontheir efforts to gain passage to the West, and left the compoundafter being promised they would not face punishment if they returnedhome.</TEXT></DOC>
