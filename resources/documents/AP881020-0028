The problem among commercial banks is serious but not as severe,the report said. It linked a third of all bank failures tomisconduct.   William B. O'Connell, president of the U.S. League of SavingsInstitutions, acknowledged that fraud ``played a significant role''in some past Sandamp;L failures.   But he maintained that the report, which covered the 3{ yearsbetween 1984 and June 1987, ``does not portray the savingsinstitution business of today.''   ``Extensive background checks are now made to keep the crooksand high fliers out of our business. Those who did slip in earlierin this decade are now gone,'' he said.   The House study comes during the worst year for failures of bothbanks and Sandamp;Ls since the Depression and amid congressional debateover whether taxpayers will be required to bail out the fundinsuring Sandamp;L deposits.   Federal regulators estimate it will cost $45 billion to $50billion to restore the savings industry to health. Private analystsput the price tag as high as $100 billion.   According to Rep. Doug Barnard Jr., D-Ga., chairman of theGovernment Operations subcommittee on monetary affairs, recentefforts by the Justice Department to combat bank fraud have been``severely hindered'' since April when department officialstransferred $1.1 million in travel money to one of former AttorneyGeneral Edwin Meese III's favored projects, an anti-obscenity taskforce.   The report said Justice Department attorneys working on bankfraud cases have been forced to stop traveling to some cities. Theresult has been a significant delay in investigations, it said.   Nearly half of bank and savings and loan failures areconcentrated in Texas and other Southwestern states sufferingeconomically from the collapse of oil prices in 1986.   But industry critics say many of the institutions have beenvictims of highflying owners and officers who misused their insiderstatus, running up huge losses through recklessness and sometimesoutright fraud.   The Barnard panel said regulators found misconduct in 168 of 210Sandamp;L insolvencies during the 3{ years ending in June 1987. They alsofound it in another 313 ailing Sandamp;Ls and 295 healthy institutions.All told, that represented about 25 percent of the entire industry,the report said.   At commercial banks, 98 of 354 failures in 1985, 1986 and thefirst half of 1987 were associated with fraud and insider abuse.   O'Connell, however, said the report's numbers ``appear to beoverblown.'' He said they categorize ``minor and perhapsunintentional infractions of complex regulations'' as misconduct.   At the end of June, 7,350 bank and Sandamp;L cases were beinginvestigated by the FBI and federal grand juries. Forty-six percentinvolved losses of $100,000 and more, and a third involvedinstitutions in Texas, California and Florida. Those three stateshave been criticized for lax banking regulations.   Barnard's subcommittee offered a laundry list ofrecommendations, including:   _The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which regulates about halfof the nation's commercial banks, should increase its examinationforce from 2,035 to 2,300 inspectors. It should boost the pay ofsenior and mid-level examiners to stem a 10 percent turnover rate.   The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which regulatesnationally chartered banks and lost a third of its seniorexecutives in 1986 and 1987 to higher paying jobs, also needs toincrease salaries.   _The FBI should end its practice of assigning junior agents tobank fraud cases and of transferring them to other jobs when theygain experience.   _The Justice Department should ensure that enough money is setaside for travel by fraud unit attorneys. It should seek more moneyfrom Congress and hire more lawyers for U.S. attorney offices.</TEXT></DOC>
