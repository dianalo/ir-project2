It said it expects the new mine will account for 14% of its total gold output in 1990.    The gold-mining company said it will spend about 15.5 million Canadian dollars (US$12.9 million) during the next 11 months, including the construction of a mill to produce a gold concentrate. The concentrate will be taken to the company's Vezina mill in Rouyn-Noranda for final gold recovery.    The production decision is conditional on the confirmation of a governmental grant for mining infrastructures and the approval of environmental authorities. A company official declined to disclose the size of the grant.    At full production, expected by next September, the company estimated the mine will process 390,000 tons of ore, or 35,000 ounces of gold, annually. Proven and probable reserves total 1.28 million tons. Operating costs are estimated at C$260 an ounce. </TEXT></DOC>
