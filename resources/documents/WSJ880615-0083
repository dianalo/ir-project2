LOUIS  </DATELINE><TEXT>   A poll of 1,001 investors suggests that George Bush might affect the nation's investment climate more than Michael Dukakis but that lower capital-gains taxes would make a bigger difference than the election of either.    Edward D. Jones andamp; Co., a nationwide brokerage firm based here, commissioned the poll, one in a series of semiannual polls it sponsors on investor attitudes.    About 45% of the respondents said the nation's investment climate would be most likely to improve under Mr. Bush, vs. 29% for Mr. Dukakis. But only 9% said that the investment climate would most likely worsen under Mr. Dukakis, while 16% thought it would most likely worsen under Mr. Bush.    Jesse Jackson would be a pox on stocks, according to these respondents: 55% said the investment climate would most likely worsen if he were elected, while only 2% said it would most likely improve.    Politics aside, what this sampling of investors hungers for, apparently, is a lower tax on capital gains. About 55% said a lowering of the capital-gains tax would &quot;encourage&quot; them to &quot;invest or invest more in the stock market in the next 12 months.&quot; Only 18% said the election of Mr. Bush would encourage them to do that; only 14% said the same for Mr. Dukakis. </TEXT></DOC>
