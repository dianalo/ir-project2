An escaped detaineeeremained in the U.S. Consulate.   Almost as soon as the six activists arrived at the BritishEmbassy in Pretoria on Wednesday, British officials made clear theydisapproved of the protest and asked that the group leave.   The activists left today after having requested Britain topressure the South African government to lift all restrictions onthem and other former detainees. Foreign Minister R.F. Botha saidthe five men and one woman would not be arrested.   The embassy said the six would be able to make an effectiveprotest to the government only if they ended their sit-in, and ``wetherefore welcome their decision to leave.''   Anti-apartheid groups had complained about the embassy's refusalto allow the six to use telephones and toilets in the building.   The National Union of Mineworkers, a militantly anti-apartheidblack union, described Britain's stance toward the activists as``shocking and inhuman.''   ``Denying them facilities necessary for human habitationconfirms out long-held views that apartheid repression is fullysupported by the British government for the realization of superprofits accruing from their sanction-busting companies in SouthAfrica,'' the union said in a statement.   Simon Ntombela, 27, was in the U.S. Consulate in a downtownJohannesburg office building, after escaping in his pajamasWednesday from a hospital in Durban, 360 miles away. Ntombelareportedly took a commercial flight to Johannesburg.   The Human Rights Commission, a private group, said Ntombela wasseeking the end of his detention, without restrictions, andunconditional freedom for all other detainees. The commission saidNtombela ended a hunger strike Wednesday.   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok was scheduled to meetAnglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu and other anti-apartheid clergymentoday to discuss the fate of scores of activists still detainedunder an emergency declared nearly three years ago to controluprisings in black communities.   Botha said Wednesday that the six would not be arrested if theyleft the embassy, although some had violated their restrictions.One of the six, labor official Donsie Khumalo, is barred frompolitical activities, confined to his home at night and must reportto a police station twice daily.   Botha said Ntombela's case was being studied and a decisionwould be made about his possible release.   Ntombela was the eighth detainee to escape from a hospital sinceSeptember. Three who took refuge in the U.S. Consulate inJohannesburg and four who reached the West German Embassy inPretoria were later allowed by the government to go free.   An estimated 600 activists have gone on hunger strikes this yearto protest their detention without trial.   The government announced Wednesday that it would now placehunger strikers in prison or in hospitals in Bloemfontein, arelatively remote provincial center, to prevent escapes andpublicity about them.   Authorities have freed most detainees since the fasts began buthas placed severe restrictions on their activities. Human rightssources say several hundred remain in detention, including morethan 30 on hunger strikes.   An estimated 30,000 people have been detained for varyingperiods under the emergency declared in June 1986.   Under apartheid, the country's 28 million blacks have no vote innational affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy andmaintain separate districts, schools and health services.</TEXT></DOC>
