It's a crime.&quot;;    &quot;Our position,&quot; her boss,District Attorney Art Danner said, &quot;it that he has to do some time in jail.There's this sense by a certain number of kids that this is OK. We want tosend a strong message that vandalism is not going to be tolerated.&quot;;    Levineturned himself in to Len Lofano, a sheriff's investigator who had learned hisidentity. Lofano was originally involved in the case because he specializes ingang-related matters.;    However, Lofano noted on Thursday, Levine is not agang member and his hundreds of &quot;8edge&quot; mottoes spray-painted around the areahave nothing to do with gangs.;    In fact, said Lofano, much graffiti istotally unrelated to gangs and much is spray-painted by &quot;Anglos, blacks,Hispanics&quot; and members of other racial and ethnic groups &quot;without any relationto race or creed.&quot;;    &quot;Many,&quot; he said, &quot;are from families with money. They'rejust bored; they're doing it for the hell of it.&quot;;    Lofano said there arethree basic types of graffiti &quot;artists,&quot; most of whom are between the age of12 and their early 20s.;    Some are gang members, he said, who use graffitito mark their turf.;    Others are &quot;piecers&quot; who paint &quot;pieces,&quot; such ascolorful murals. These, said Lofano, believe in &quot;art for art's sake&quot; combinedwith a &quot;catch-me-if-you-can&quot; attitude. Sometimes, he said, piecers are hiredby shopkeepers and building owners to put murals on their walls.;    Many, hesaid -- including Noah Levine -- are &quot;taggers&quot; who spray-paint their logos ona &quot;hit-and-run basis&quot; trying to avoid the police.;    &quot;8edge,&quot; said Lofano,comes from the word &quot;straightedge.&quot; Straightedge, he said, describes a&quot;puritanical&quot; way of life espoused by some young people, a vegetarianlifestyle with no premarital sex, no drugs or alcohol, no smoking and nocaffeine.;    &quot;But they apparently can do vandalism,&quot; he said, &quot;What aparadox!&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  LEE QUARNSTROM, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Santa Cruz/Monterey  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910816  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  August  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  527  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday August 16, 199100229127,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
