Nujoma's speech was his first in Namibia since he went intoexile in 1959.   The crowd also comprised one of the largest political meetingsin this territory where, under a U.N. independence plan, SouthAfrica gradually is relinquishing control after 74 years.   The crowd, predominantly black with a handful of whites, packeda sports stadium to hear Nujoma, president of the South-West AfricaPeople's Organization, who returned from exile on Sept. 14.   Namibians, he said, have ``a historic opportunity for our peopleto choose a government of the people, by the people, for thepeople'' at independence elections in November.   Nujoma called for reconciliation in this former Germany colony,where his organization has fought a largely unsuccesful bush warsince 1966 to end South African rule.   He promised that if his left-leaning movement gains control of apost-independence government it will not exclude those withdiffering views.   ``SWAPO has no intention of imposing a one-party politicalsystem on the Namibian people against their will,'' he said,repeating a previously stated reversal of party policy. ``SWAPOdoes not intend to rule Namibia alone, but will seek theparticipation of others in formulating and implementing policy.''   The speech took more than two hours to complete because it wastranslated from English into Afrikaans and three local languages.   ``Viva PLAN,'' shouted Nujoma, saluting the People's LiberationArmy of Namibia _ the guerrilla wing of his organization.   South Africa agreed last year to implement a U.N. independenceplan as part of a regional accord that granted Pretoria'slongstanding demand for withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban troops fromAngola, Namibia's northern neighbor.   Nujoma's party is favored to win most votes in U.N.-supervisedelections Nov. 7-11 that will choose participants in an assemblyassigned to draft a constitution. But it is uncertain whether itwill win the two-third majority needed to control the assemblysince at least 10 parties are contesting.   About 700,000 of the territory's 1.3 million people haveregistered to vote. Namibia's population includes 80,000 whites.   Nujoma alleged the election campaign has been marred byintimidation against his supporters, and cited the Sept. 12unsolved assassination of Anton Lubowksi, the only ranking whiteofficial in the movement.   He reiterated his party's proposals to encourage foreigninvestment and create a mixed economy.   Regional stability in Southern Africa can come only when SouthAfrica dismantles apartheid, Nujoma said, but he commended recentpledges by new South African President F.W. de Klerk to seek racialreconciliation.   Nujoma, 63, last addressed meetings in Namibia in 1959, when heled a campaign protesting the forced removal of a black communityon the outskirts of Windhoek, the capital.   His organization's image recently has been damaged by continuingreports of atrocities by its guerrilla fighters against members ofthe movement suspected of spying for South Africa. Many freeddetainees say they were tortured into making false confessions, andthey say hundreds of other detainees either remain in custody orhave been killed.   Nujoma made no mention of the allegations in his speech.</TEXT></DOC>
