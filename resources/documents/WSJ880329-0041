Some of the payouts were in cash, others in awards of stock. The banks offered a variety of explanations for the incentive pay, in a year when most of the biggest banks had losses because of increased reserves on their loans to Latin American nations.    Latin American loans are &quot;strategically irrelevant,&quot; said Barry F. Sullivan, chairman and chief executive officer of First Chicago Corp. There is little at this point he can do to collect those loans, he noted, and his company made substantial progress in other areas in 1987, even as First Chicago had its worst ever net loss of $570.7 million. Mr. Sullivan was paid about $900,000 in cash and stock bonuses, on top of his $604,215 salary.    Other banks echoed Mr. Sullivan's sentiment that the Latin American loan problems, though huge, are outside the control of management and thus shouldn't wipe out executive bonuses. &quot;You have to understand,&quot; a First Interstate Bancorp., Los Angeles, spokesman said, &quot;there are losses and then there are losses.&quot; The bonus of Joseph Pinola, chairman and chief executive, the spokesman said, was based on both a four-year performance plan and a one-year plan, and also takes into account pay at the top 20 banks in the U.S.    Gerry Findley, a Brea, Calif., consultant to smaller community banks, asserted that only the huge money center institutions could get away with paying bonuses for an unprofitable year. &quot;Usually we give them their exit papers&quot; for such a year, Mr. Findley said. &quot;Very seldom does someone get a bonus for not performing.&quot;    Security Pacific Corp., Los Angeles, also said it paid bonuses because, aside from the Latin American debt problem, the company performed well in 1987. Willard C. Butcher, chairman of Chase Manhattan Corp., received cash compensation totaling $1.04 million. A Chase spokesman said the figure included a bonus, but declined to say how much. Last year Chase had a net loss of $894 million.    Some banks said the bonuses were smaller than the previous year and others said the payouts were computed against what other large banks pay.    Among the biggest banks, however, it's seldom that top executives aren't paid a bonus of some sort. For instance, although Citicorp's top management went without cash bonuses for 1987, John S. Reed, chairman and chief executive, was nevertheless awarded 25,000 shares of stock valued at $481,250 based on yesterday's closing price of $19.25 a share. His 1987 salary was $840,300. A Citicorp executive said the bank skipped paying a cash bonus because, &quot;It wouldn't look right in a year we lost money&quot; -- $1.14 billion.    Stock awards of the sort Messrs. Sullivan and Reed received, which come on top of stock options bankers typically get, are increasingly added to top banks' incentive pay packages. The shares, which can't be sold immediately, serve as so-called &quot;golden handcuffs,&quot; compensation consultants say, as executives stick around to collect them.    David Kraus, an executive compensation consultant at Arthur Andersen andamp; Co. in Chicago, said banker pay has been pushed up in recent years as commercial banks compete with Wall Street for talent. As lower echelon traders and investment bankers at commercial banks are paid more, &quot;that almost puts a floor under what they can pay the chief executive officer,&quot; Mr. Kraus said.    Some banks, in proxy materials where executive pay must be disclosed, group salary and cash bonuses into a single figure so the size of bonuses isn't known. Wells Fargo andamp; Co.'s chairman and chief executive, Carl E. Reichardt was paid $1,140,335 in cash last year, down from about $1.2 million in 1986. &quot;A large percentage&quot; of both figures was bonus, a Wells Fargo spokesman said, but he wouldn't be more specific. Wells's board bases his bonus on the bank's performance, as measured against the top 15 banks. Last year, Wells's net income dipped 81% to $50.8 million.    Both men who served as Continental Illinois Corp.'s chief executive during 1987 were paid cash bonuses. The company reported a $609.5 million loss that included large additions to reserves for Latin American loans, and a big loss from Continental's options clearing unit, First Options of Chicago Inc. That unit was purchased before Thomas C. Theobald left Citicorp to join Continental, but the new chief executive said recently that his bid to buy First Options for Citicorp in 1986 was second only to Continental's. Continental wouldn't comment on executive pay.    ---        Big Banks Pay Bonuses Despite Poor Year                          1987 Loss/                          Profit                          Decline             Incentive  Bank/CEO                (In millions)       Pay  Citicorp                -$1,138.0           $481,250*  John Reed -  Manufacturers  Hanover Corp.           -$1,140.0             70,000  John F.
