Before long, they fear, problems like inflation in Great Britainor rising interest rates in Japan could start to cause real troublefor the business and financial climate in this country.   Analysts say those misgivings have played a big part in the U.S.stock market's shaky start on the 1990s.   Many yearend forecasts called for lower interest rates for U.S.consumers and business managers at least through the first severalmonths of 1990. That optimism seemed to be validated early thispast week as banks announced a long-awaited cut in the primelending rate from 10.5 percent to 10 percent.   Interest rates in the U.S. bond and short-term money marketsheld steady even on Friday, when the government reported a largerthan expected 0.7 percent increase in the producer price index offinished goods for December.   But stock traders didn't take the news so calmly, confronted asthey were with word of falling markets in Tokyo and London.   While the Federal Reserve has been gradually relaxing its creditpolicy, encouraging rates to fall in this country, central banks inseveral foreign lands have tightened credit in an effort torestrain inflation.   As a result, German and Japanese interest rates in particularhave been climbing, narrowing a once-wide gap between yieldsavailable in securities of those countries and what globalinvestors could get in the U.S. Treasury market.   These days, yields of a little more than 8 percent on Americangovernment bonds must compete with 7.5 percent or so in WestGermany; 6.5 percent in Japan, and around 10.5 percet in Britain.   Sooner or later, analysts say, this trend could force theTreasury to pay higher interest rates to attract buyers of itssecurities in the world marketplace. In other words, Americaninterest rates would rise because of a form of internationalcompetition.   ``I believe that any further moves by the other central banks toraise rates would be a very important factor in determining theinvestment outlook for 1990,'' said strategist Greg Smith in hiscurrent market commentary for Prudential-Bache Securities.   Taken to its extreme, international interest-rate competitioncould foster a global credit-tightening that might increase thechances of recession in most or all industrial countries.   Such visions, analysts say, are a long way yet from becomingreality. But the prospect alone was enough to stifle the stockmarket's early-1990 rally before it got very far.   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 84.04 to 2,689.21in the past week, wiping out the previous week's 20.05-point gain.   The New York Stock Exchange composite index dropped 6.32 to188.32; the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter marketlost 18.50 to 439.72, and the American Stock Exchange market valueindex was down 10.22 at 372.23.   Big Board volume averaged 161.92 million shares a day, down from172.48 million the week before.   Of course, a lot of optimism persists that the opening up ofeastern Europe and a new Common Market business alliance in 1992will help propel worldwide growth past any obstacles that mightarise.   Tom Marsico, portfolio manager of the Denver-based Janus Twentymutual fund, says about 25 percent of his stock holdings areconcentrated in Europe and shares of U.S. companies with a stake inthe opportunities there.   Though the economic promise of an increasingly democratic Europehas been widely touted, Marsico takes the view that its fullpotential hasn't yet been realized.   ``We think events there are going to go at a much faster ratethan most people realize,'' he declares.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Weekend Editions Jan. 13-14</NOTE></DOC>
