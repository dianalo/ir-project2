Also Tuesday, the government and rebels blamed each other forthe breakdown of talks aimed at forging a lasting peace in the7-year-old civil war.   Borge told a news conference that the march planned for Sunday _the first since a July 10 rally in which 40 opposition figures werearrested _ was intended ``to create disturbances.''   He acknowledged that the denial of the opposition DemocraticCoordinate's petition Tuesday leaves the leftist Sandinistagovernment open to criticism, but added:   ``It would be worse and would be a larger political cost and agreater pretext for our enemy and more of an argument for aid tothe Contras if there were provocations here that led to bloodshedin the streets of Managua.''   The Sandinistas claimed the U.S. Embassy backed the June 10protest, which ended in a clash between protesters and police.Nicaragua charged the embassy was seeking a plan to undermine thegovernment. The following day, the U.S. ambassador, Richard Melton,was expelled from the country.   In Washington on Tuesday, House Speaker Jim Wright said the CIAhad acknowledged in congressional testimony that it used undercoveragents in Nicaragua to stir up public protest, hoping thegovernment would overreact.   Wright, D-Texas, said he did not know if the July 10demonstration in Nandaime, south of Managua, was the result of U.S.provocations.   The Democratic Coordinate protested the government's decision toban Sunday's march.   ``Political groups should have access to the means ofcommunication, take part in the right of association and theability to hold public demonstrations,'' the newspaper La Prensaquoted Duilio Baltodano, an opposition leader, as saying.   Government and rebel negotiators held talks Monday in GuatemalaCity in an attempt to reopen peace negotiations to end the war,which the government says has claimed more than 28,000 lives.   ``The interest of Managua is to agree on a definitivecease-fire, which the Contras have rejected,'' Victor Tinoco,deputy foreign minister and Sandinista negotiator, was quoted astelling the pro-goverment newspaper El Nuevo Diario.   The rebels have said they would enter formal negotiations onlyafter Nicaragua frees the 40 opposition leaders.   The government and rebels signed a pact on March 23 providingfor a temporary truce and talks in Managua. But the Contras saythey will participate only if they are held anywhere but theNicaraguan capital, where they say their movement is restricted.   The Sandinistas insist Managua be the site of negotiations.   ``This is a clear demonstration of the lack of Sandinista desireto establish or take measures and set up reforms that permit ademocratic opening,'' said Roberto Ferrey, one of seven Contraleaders. He spoke Tuesday on the rebels' clandestine RadioLiberation.   Negotiations to set a timetable for the rebels to lay down theirarms and for the Sandinistas to institute democratic reforms endedin stalemate June 9.   The U.S. Congress cut off military aid to the rebels Feb. 29.The Contras claim they need such aid to act as a bargaining chip innegotiations.</TEXT></DOC>
