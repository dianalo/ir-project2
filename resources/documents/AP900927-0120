One of eight barrels of North Slope oil goes to the state, whichalso derives revenues from severance taxes on oil production. Thestate derives 85 percent of its revenue from oil and gasproduction. A $1 a barrel increase in oil prices adds $150 millionin yearly revenues to the state treasury.   Oil prices shot up from $13 a barrel in July to current spotmarket prices of $37 a barrel, fueled by fear of war with Iraq.   State budget director Alison Elgee said a proposed $50 millionsupplemental spending package of more than $50 million is beingprepared for the next governor who will be elected in November. Anynew spending plan would have to be approved by the Legislature,which convenes in mid-January.   Elgee said about half the proposed supplemental expenditureswould go toward restoration of programs and services cut byDemocratic Gov. Steve Cowper's vetoes in July. The rest would coversuch things as state employee wage increases and expenses for oilspill litigation, she said.   Current state spending is pegged at $2.6 billion for the currentfiscal year. Cowper cut $325 million in July, citing sagging oilprices and overspending by the legislature.   Cowper, who is not seeking re-election, said he wants the stateto save most of the windfall generated by the Middle East crisis.   ``I think most people believe there will be a substantialsurplus,'' Cowper said. ``My view is that most of the money shouldbe saved. We're not going to recommend enormous sums be put backinto the budget.''</TEXT></DOC>
