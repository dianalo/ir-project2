The dispute, which is causing strains within the NATO alliance,was aired for nearly four hours Monday by high-level West Germanand American delegations.   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher and DefenseMinister Gerhard Stoltenberg then headed back to Bonn to bring thebad news to Chancellor Helmut Kohl.   Kohl's political future could be clouded by failure to persuadethe Americans to open negotiations with Moscow on the U.S.-builtLance missiles.   The West German electorate is turning more toward disarmament,and the left-leaning Social Democrats and Greens are gaining groundin the polls against Kohl's own Christian Democrats. Localelections are being held in June.   Before leaving for Bonn, however, Genscher and Stoltenberg toldGerman reporters the talks were ``encouraging.'' They did notelaborate.   Kohl's formal presentation will be made in his governmentaldeclaration to the West German parliament on Thursday.   Among the Americans at the meeting Secretary of State James A.Baker III, Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney and Brent Scowcroft,the president's assistant for national security affairs.   Cheney made it clear before the meeting that the United Stateswould oppose reducing short-range nuclear missile strength whilethe Soviets hold an advantage in non-nuclear forces in Europe.   Baker said through a spokeswoman he understood ``the FederalRepublic's problem regarding the timing of any such decision'' tomodernize. Kohl also was seeking a delay in plans to extend therange of the Lance missiles.   The meeting was hastily arranged Friday, when Kohl called Bush.   Unless the issue is resolved, it could disrupt the summitmeeting Bush will attend at the end of May with the leaders of the15 other North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries in Brussels.   Kohl's domestic concerns conflict with the determined drive bythe United States, Britain and France to keep the Lances on WestGerman soil.   Genscher and Stoltenberg gave no indication as they left theState Department whether they had made any headway.   Baker issued a brief statement that described the meeting as``useful and friendly.'' He said the discussions would be continued``in an effort to reach an agreement within the alliance.''   ``Secretary Baker has said many times that it would bepreferable if we could move to modernize our short-range nuclearweapons, although we understand the Federal Republic's problemregarding the timing of any such decision,'' State Departmentspokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said as the parties met. ``And he hassaid that we think it would be a mistake to engage in arms controlnegotiations on SNF (Short-range Nuclear Forces).''   Cheney, speaking at the National Defense University before themeeting, said negotiating at this point with the Soviets over themissiles would be a mistake because of their overwhelmingsuperiority in non-nuclear forces.   ``For the foreseeable future, certainly as long as there isoverwhelming Soviet conventional superiority,'' the defensesecretary said, ``there's absolutely no rationale at all for us totalk about eliminating or significantly reducing those short-rangeforces.''   Cheney said the United States would proceed with ``early work''to improve the Lance missile system. ``It does not require a firmcommitment, now, or a specific decision, now, by a specificgovernment,'' he said.   Opponents of the missiles are concerned that having an arsenalof Lances is an incentive to use them, and that any nuclearconflict between East and West would spread to a world-threateningwar.   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher will fly to Bonn onSunday to try to persuade Kohl to suspend his campaign forU.S.-Soviet negotiations on the issue.   Kohl has support among several of the smaller NATO countries,including Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands and Denmark.</TEXT></DOC>
