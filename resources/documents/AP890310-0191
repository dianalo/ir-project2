In the strongest statement yet from a Bush administrationofficial about the weapons, Sessions echoed concerns expressed bystate and local law enforcement following the Jan. 17 fatalshootings of five California children with a Soviet-style AK-47rifle.   ``The presence of these weapons does have a very destructiveimpact on American society and the people,'' Sessions told reporters.   ``Tragedy after tragedy flows from it,'' Sessions said. ``Peopleand law enforcement officers are victims of these crimes.''   ``I am sorry we are outgunned and outmanned in that respect,''the director said.   But Sessions would not say whether he agreed with other lawenforcement officials who are calling for a ban on the weapons.   ``It's not my responsiblity to make that kind of decision,''Sessions said. ``That's a political debate I will not participatein.''   President Bush has resisted calls for outlawing the weapons, manyof which can be altered to become automatic rifles, such as theweapon a man used to spray more than 100 rounds of ammunitionoutside an elementary school in Stockton, Calif.   The president, however, said earlier this week that he wanted tofind a method of preventing the criminal use of the weapons whiledoing ``what's right by the legitimate sportsman.''   Bush, a member of the National Rifle Association, said he hadasked William Bennett, picked by the president to direct thenation's war on drugs, to study the proliferation of assault weapons.   Sessions, meanwhile, defended the FBI's background investigationof John Tower during the former Texas senator's unsuccessful bid towin Senate confirmation as defense secretary.   The lengthy investigation of Tower prompted criticism by somesenators that the FBI was conveying unsupported rumors andallegations about the former Republican senator.   Tower's drinking habits, relationships with women and financialties were criticized during the debate leading up to Thursday's53-47 Senate vote to reject the nominee.   But Sessions, who removed himself from the Tower investigationbecause of past political ties, said ``the bureau carried out itsfunction in this case as I'm sure it did in hundreds of othercases.''   ``We have had absolutely no criticism at all concerning theconduct of the investigation from the White House,'' Sessions said,adding that he saw ``no need to change at all'' the FBI's proceduresfor conducting such background checks.   Floyd Clarke, the bureau's director of investigations, said theFBI carefully tries to verify any derogatory allegations made abouta nominee.   Later in the day, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh also defendedthe FBI, saying ``the criticism results from a misunderstanding ofwhat the role of the Federal Bureau of Investigation is in carryingout background checks.''   ``It is not the job of the Federal Bureau of Investigation tomake judgmenets about the individuals'' nominated for governmentposts, Thornburgh said. ``It is their job to gather information.''   ``No one to my knowledge has any quarrel with the accuracy of thejob that's been done by the FBI,'' Thornburgh said.   Responding to reports of friction with the attorney general,Sessions said he enjoyed a ``direct, cordial'' relationship with theThornburgh.   But Sessions said he had stopped holding informal breakfastmeetings with members of Congress. The attorney general, who hastold officials the Justice Department will ``speak with one voice,''reportedly was irritated that Sessions had not cleared the meetingswith his office.   ``I regard the attorney general of the United States as theperson for whom I work at the Department of Justice,'' Sessionssaid. ``I agreed fully with his one-voice concept, I think it's veryimportant we speak in that fashion.''   He called reports that Thornburgh was trying to get him to take afederal appellate judgeship were ``as much a surprise to me asanyone.''   Sessions said he intended to continue as FBI director.</TEXT></DOC>
