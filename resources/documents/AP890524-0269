(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   In the latest crackdown on penny stockfraud, four former employees of a defunct brokerage have pleadedguilty in connection with a scheme prosecutors say bilked customersnationwide of $67 million.   ``These are not mere technical violations of securities laws,''U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito Jr. said Tuesday. ``They were blatantfrauds that cost investors millions of dollars.''   The Paramus-based company, F.D. Roberts Securities Inc.,systematically manipulated stock prices that bilked thousands ofcustomers across the country, Alito said.   Before declaring bankruptcy last February, the company also hadoffices in Boca Raton and Tampa, Fla., and in California.   Robert Humphrey, F.D. Roberts' former national sales manager,admitted in U.S. District Court here to conspiring with other topmanagement at the firm to use dozens of fraudulent techniques tosell the stocks.   Humphrey faces up to 20 years in prison and a fine of $1million. He specifically pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracyto commit securities fraud, and three counts of securities fraud.   Also pleading guilty to related charges were Kenneth Eisen, theformer manager of the firm, and Pamella Rutherford, a broker, bothof Boca Raton; and Glenn Siesser, a broker, of Highland Beach, Fla.   Eisen and Rutherford pleaded guilty to one count each ofsecurities fraud. Seisser pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud.   All face maximum sentnces of five years in prison and fines of$250,000.   U.S. District Judge Nicholas H. Politan will sentence them Aug.22.   Alito said the first step in the scheme was for F.D. Roberts tolocate or create companies, which usually existed only on paper andhad few or no assets.   The companies would then make an initial public offering of thestock. F.D. Roberts would then purchase the stock in nomineeaccounts that its officals referred to as ``dirt-bag'' accounts,Alito said.   F.D. Roberts' stockbrokers would then conceal their ownership inthe accounts while they touted and sold the securities at inflatedprices, Alito said and Humphrey admitted in court.   The sales manager hired a young, inexperienced sales staff withlittle or no training in securities. The employees usedhigh-pressure, badgering telephone sales techniques to sell thestock.   Alito said up to 250 of the brokers worked at any given time,some of them making up to $250,000 a year.   Alito said he would seek restitution for the investors, but headded officials are not sure where all the money generated by theF.D. Roberts is.</TEXT></DOC>
