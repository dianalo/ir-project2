The case against Pfizer would be based largely on anagency task force investigation report completed in Decemberand made public last Thursday following a congressionalhearing on FDA activities. An agency spokesman refused todiscuss the Pfizer case. A spokesman for Rep. John Dingell(D., Mich.) said the FDA twice had failed to persuade theJustice Department to bring criminal charges against Pfizer,but the FDA still was contemplating civil action.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We can't comment on the report,&quot; said Don McLearn, an FDAspokesman. &quot;We consider it confidential because theinvestigation remains open.&quot;   The report charged that Shiley knew about problems withthe heart valve and failed to report them to the FDA beforeand after the agency's 1979 approval of the device for use.Some 85,000 so-called 60-degree Shiley valves were soldworld-wide from 1978 to 1986, when the company pulled thedevices off the market. As of early 1990, 394 of the valveswere known to have failed because of a specific designfailure, causing more than 250 deaths and an avalanche oflawsuits against the Pfizer and the Shiley unit.   On Friday, Pfizer said it &quot;vigorously&quot; disputed the taskforce's findings, which it hadn't seen prior to the releaseof the report. The New York-based pharmaceutical and healthproducts maker said the report omitted &quot;important informationessential for a full undestanding of the issues&quot; andcontained &quot;no new substantive information.&quot;   The problems with the Shiley valve involve fractures inthe struts welded on the inside of the valve that controlsmovement of blood through the heart. The task forceinvestigation, which included documents and findingsunearthed in 1990 by Mr. Dingell's House subcommittee onoversight and investigation, concluded that Shiley obtainedmarketing approval for the valve by &quot;failing to revealmaterial information it had regarding the defect.&quot;   The report also said that Shiley provided incompleteinformation to support its claim that the valve was superiorto other valves, a major reason the FDA was persuaded toapprove the device. The FDA then referred its findings to theJustice Department.   Last spring, the Justice Department informed thesubcommittee's staff that it had decided against bringing acriminal action against Pfizer, according to DennisFitzgibbons, a spokesman for Mr. Dingell.   About six weeks ago, the FDA told the subcommittee staffthat more information regarding the heart valve case had beensent to Justice in hopes of reviving interest in a criminalprosecution, Mr. Fitzgibbons said. Three weeks ago, the stafflearned that two federal prosecutors had declined to take onthe case, mainly because the statute of limitations hadexpired on several pivotal events in the approval andmarketing of the Shiley valve.   The Justice Department declined to comment on the case.   Mr. Fitzgibbons said that Margaret Porter, the FDA'sgeneral counsel, telephoned the subcommittee's staff lastWednesday to say that the agency still was considering civilaction. &quot;We're delighted&quot; by the FDA's actions regarding theShiley case, Mr. Dingell said. &quot;We wish they had done so sometime back.&quot;   The FDA report's release late on Thursday, and confusionabout its meaning, set off a wave of uncertainty among Pfizerinvestors. On Thursday, Pfizer's shares tumbled $2.50 to$64.375 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. In latetrading Friday, after the company disputed the report'sfindings, Pfizer's shares were quoted at $63.75, down anadditional 62.5 cents on unusually heavy volume of 3.3million shares.   Pfizer's shares have almost doubled since last year whenthe Shiley issue was a dark cloud over the company'sfortunes. But in recent months investors have been buoyed byexpectations for several of the company's new drugs, whichuntil last week overshadowed concern about the valve case.</TEXT></DOC>
