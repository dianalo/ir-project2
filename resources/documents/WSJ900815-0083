First Brands, which said that it is continuing to solicitbids for a sale of the company, reported earnings of $4.4million, or 20 cents per share, for the quarter ended June30, up from $863,000, or four cents per share, in theyear-earlier period.</LP><TEXT>   The company's total fourth-quarter sales, however, weredown to $248 million, from $273.3 million a year earlier.   First Brands, which was created by a 1986 leveraged buyoutof several businesses from the Union Carbide Corp., said thatstrong sales of its Glad plastic bags and wraps and its STPautomotive additives more than offset lagging sales of itsPrestone antifreeze.   The company's chief financial officer, Donald DeSantis,explained that antifreeze prices had fallen since an earliershortage of a petrochemical ingredient had eased.   The company's Glad and STP brand products, however, havebeen increasing in unit volume, sales and profitability, hesaid.   In late June, the controlling shareholders of First Brandsannounced that they were seeking a buyer for all or part ofthe company.   &quot;The process of soliciting bids to purchase the company iscontinuing, and several parties have expressed an interest,&quot;said Alfred E. Dudley, the company's chairman, chiefexecutive officer, and president, in a prepared statement.   For the fiscal year, earnings were $49.6 million, or $2.40per share, down from $61.0 million, or $3.03 per share, infiscal 1989. Total sales were $1.01 billion in 1990, downfrom $1.21 billion in 1989.   The 1989 results, however, were inflated by a $15.5million gain from the sale of the company'shousehold-products business in Europe. In addition, 1990earnings were hurt by a $786,000 charge related to therepurchase of senior subordinated debt.</TEXT></DOC>
