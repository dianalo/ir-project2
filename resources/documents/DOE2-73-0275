Nuclear matter measurement techniques are developed for 20 literspackages and for 100 and 200-liter drums. The methods are adapted toheavy and light matrices and to irradiating matter. A synthesis of resultsfrom different measuring stations is presented, for instance a detectionthreshold is few milligrams of plutonium in a 200-liter drum.</TEXT></DOC>
