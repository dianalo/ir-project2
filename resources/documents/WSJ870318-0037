Sources familiar with the proposal said Cruse W. Moss, chairman and chief executive officer of closely held General Automotive, an Ann Arbor, Mich.-based bus maker, has approached Raymond A. Hay, LTV's chairman, president and chief executive, and other top LTV executives with a purchase offer. But the sources said Mr. Hay so far has rebuffed Mr. Moss, who was president of AM General until 1980. LTV purchased the unit from American Motors Corp. in 1983 for $170 million.    An LTV spokesman said Messrs. Moss and Hay &quot;have talked previously&quot; but he repeatedly denied that the two have ever discussed any proposals concerning AM General. &quot;There's absolutely no truth to it,&quot; he said. &quot;LTV has no intention to sell AM General and we have not been approached by a buyer.&quot;    Mr. Moss was out of town yesterday and couldn't be reached for comment. He didn't return earlier phone calls seeking comment on the reports.    But sources close to AM General and Mr. Moss said he is suggesting a $60 million price tag for the division, which had 1986 sales of $700 million, or 9.6% of LTV's total sales of $7.3 billion. The division has failed to receive several big competitive contracts over the past two years, and it posted a 1986 operating loss, which LTV didn't specify. Last year, LTV took $175 million in charges related to the division.    The big steel, aerospace and energy concern filed last July for protection from creditors' lawsuits under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. LTV has had $4.69 billion in losses over the past five years, mostly from its beleaguered steel unit, the nation's second largest. LTV plans to reorganize around its aerospace and defense unit, its only profitable line, which accounted for almost two-thirds of LTV's 1986 operating profit of $171.9 million.    The sources said Mr. Moss probably will persist in seeking AM General but may lie low for a while. &quot;He really wants to be in that business,&quot; one source said. At White Motor Corp., where Mr. Moss worked after leaving AM General, he tried unsuccessfully to get the Army contract for its M-939 five-ton military trucks.    Last year, Mr. Moss tried again, and basically succeeded in wresting from AM General the $1 billion contract, which represented about half of the division's business. A joint venture he formed with York, Pa.-based Harsco Corp.'s BMY division, which makes and overhauls armored vehicles, received the contract. But BMY President Ralph Cordes said his company bought out General Automotive's interest before the contract was awarded.    Industry executives said they believe Mr. Moss, known for his shrewd bidding abilities, would be a stiff competitor for AM General's only remaining major contract, the Army's Hummer land vehicle, which is expected to be reopened for bidding this year.    While the sale of LTV's entire aerospace and defense unit as part of any reorganization would be hard-fought by many parties to the bankruptcy-law proceedings, a fair offer for AM General alone probably wouldn't bring many objections. Some creditors concede privately they would press for the sale if LTV were to turn down a fair price. LTV says it wants to keep the unit because it believes foreign sales of the five-ton trucks are rebounding. Last week, AM General received a contract from Pakistan for $18.5 million of the vehicles. </TEXT></DOC>
