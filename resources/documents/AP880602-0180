The voice vote action sends the bill to the floor of theDemocratic-controlled House, where it is expected to be considerednext week.   The bill appropriates $299.5 billion for the Pentagon for thefiscal year starting Oct. 1, which would be a reduction from thecurrent defense budget of $301 billion.   The bill appropriates $3.5 billion for the Strategic DefenseInitiative, as Star Wars is formally known. Reagan had sought $4.9billion for the program, which has a $3.9 billion budget for thecurrent year.   The bill appropriates money already authorized by the House lastmonth in a separate Pentagon measure.   The appropriations bill did not contain a series of arms controlrestrictions added last month by Democrats to the authorizationbill.   Those restrictions eliminate all but the smallest nuclear tests,require adherence to the unratified 1979 SALT II nuclear armstreaty and ban spending money for any Star Wars tests that violatethe existing interpretation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missiletreaty.   The restrictions were dropped from the legislation approvedThursday hiefly because of a jurisdictional fight within the Housebetween the Appropriations Committee and the Armed ServicesCommittee, which oversees the authorization bill.   Under House rules, the appropriation bills are only supposed toinvolve amounts of money, and not include policy issues such asarms control. The Armed Services Committee had objected to addingthe arms control restrictions to the appropriations bill.   Rep. Norman Dicks, D-Wash., a member of the AppropriationsCommittee and a supporter of the restrictions, said, ``I think youmight see the arms control amendments added on the floor.''   ``My instinct is that it helps to have them on both bills,appropriations and the authorization bill,'' said Dicks. ``I wouldsupport adding them on the floor.''   Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., said, ``We didn't add the arms controlprovision basically because of a jurisdictional question.''</TEXT></DOC>
