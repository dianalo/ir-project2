(a subsidiary of Fieldman, Rolapp, and Associates), is anindependent financial advisory firm that provides support services togovernment agencies in California.andP;  Through their experiences in helpingagencies deal with assessment district administration, they realized thatthis job was a prime candidate for automation.andP;  So they called us in to helpthem.andM;The system we developed, Assessment District Administration Management orADAM, automates this process by calculating assessment amounts, then trackingmonies due and paid over the bond's life.andP;  ADAM protects both the taxpayerand the agency by ensuring that the amounts charged and collected arecorrect.andP;  By handling time-consuming calculations and recordkeeping, ADAMfrees up the agency to concentrate on time-consuming administrativefunctions.andM;Our goal was to take the manual method of administration, simplify it as muchas possible, then automate it.andP;  Our main objectives were:andM;* To make the program reflect changes in the law easily.andP;  As with many legalissues, we discovered, there's rarely a stable consensus about what a lawreally means.andP;  Consequently, the code needed to be easy to modify.andM;* To interpret and simplify the complicated financial calculations involvedin the administration process.andM;* To provide accurate and reliable information for public agencies andtaxpayers.andM;* To make the program easy for all levels of users.andM;As our first step, we needed to meld all of these objectives into acomprehensive working plan: the bid specification.andP;  This document would serveas the working blueprint for our creation.andM;As with any new endeavor, we had to start from the beginning.andP;  That meanteducation: gaining a basic understanding of assessment districts, the law,and inherent problems with administration.andP;  We gained the most valuableinformation in frequent meetings and interviews with current assessmentdistrict administrators.andM;Once we had a vague idea of our mission, we moved to the next step: creatingthe user interface.andP;  We had two requirements: the program had to be simpleenough for a person with little or no computer experience; likewise, itshouldn't require extensive assessment district knowledge.andM;We used Wallsoft's UI Programmer to help us create, model, and refinescreens.andP;  We found the draw and paint tools indispensable during the programdesign stage.andP;  To make sure we knew where we were going, we spentconsiderable time and effort in this phase of the project.andM;We chose Clipper because it gave us considerable flexibility in thedevelopment of ADAM.andP;  While most of the dBASE dialects have increased inpower and features, Clipper's beats them because it offers an EXE compiler.andM;Deep in the development phaseandM;During development, we tried to keep in mind our real customer: the user.andP;  Ofcourse, this sounds obvious, but think back.andP;  Remember a time when you mayhave gotten swept away in the creation of the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; of applications?andO;Often, we return to reality with a program that is technically impressive,but difficult to learn and use.andP;  Keeping in close contact with your clientsand users can give you valuable &quot;milestone checks&quot; that make sure the projectremains on track.andM;A closer lookandM;Of all of our development goals, a simple and attractive user interface wasour top priority.andP;  However, even a breathtaking screen that was functionallyinadequate would be a dreadful disappointment.andP;  ADAM screens had to performwell too.andP;  We wanted to allow the user to move to any field on the screen atany time, to achieve a true full-screen editing effect.andP;  No problem, right?andO;Wrong!andP;  Most data entry requires moderate to intensive data validation andsome degree of error trapping.andM;We arrived at the following solution.andP;  As with many of the dBASE languages,simple data validation can be accomplished using the VALID command.andP;  Inaddition, Clipper allows program control to be passed from the current VALIDto a User Defined Function (UDF) for more complex processing.andP;  By connectinga series of GETs representing the data entry screen to a single READstatement, all of the subsequent processing can be performed inside the UDF.andO;If acceptable data has been entered, a logical .T.andP;  is returned from the UDF.andO;Processing continues normally and the cursor is positioned based on the lastsuccessful keystroke.andP;  If validation fails, a logical .F.andP;  is returned.andP;  Theuser is not allowed to exit the current GET.andM;Ultimately, this process allows the user to edit without the frustration ofmoving in only one direction through the screen.andP;  It gives the program a&quot;pencil and eraser&quot; feeling, where the user can move directly to a field andcorrect a mistake.andP;  This means they're less likely to resist the new system,because making and fixing errors is no big deal.andM;Listing 1 gives an example of a User Defined Function called from a VALID.andM;Next on our wish list for ADAM was a standard exit routine.andP;  We wanted theuser to be able to use the Esc key to exit anywhere, anytime in the program.andO;Exiting from menus was simple for us to achieve.andP;  Our challenge, however, wasto provide this feature globally throughout the application.andM;To create this feature, we used the Clipper BEGIN and END SEQUENCE.andP;  Thiscommand set defines a program sequence of statements.andP;  If a BREAK statementis issued, program control branches to the statement immediately followingthe END SEQUENCE.andM;When Esc key is pressed, program execution is passed to the ESCPROCprocedure.andP;  There, a DO CASE structure isolates the current instance, assignsan escape prompt, and performs appropriate close-down tasks.andM;The code in Listing 2 offers a sample ESCAPE PROCEDURE.andP;  This can be hookedto any programmable key with the SET KEY command.andM;Now that it's overandM;Currently, several California agencies are using ADAM, including: the City ofOrange, the City of Palm Springs, the City of Lake Elsinore, the City ofRancho Cucamonga, the City of Modesto, the Eastern Municipal Water District,and the Indian Wells Valley Water District.andP;  We think we've succeeded withour goals.andP;  If it doesn't sound too presumptuous, we'd like to offer you someadvice for the next application you work on (this is the same advice we'll begiving ourselves as well).andM;First, double planning time and decrease coding time-- Why?andP;  Often, it wasn'tuntil after a feature was coded out that we realized a problem existed.andP;  Keepin mind that old cliche, &quot;Look before you leap.&quot;andM;The chart in Fig.andP;  1 illustrates the differences between our estimated andactual hours spent on the project.andP;  It also shows what we've learned aboutplanning and resources for future projects.andM;Second, handle documentation last.andP;  Eager to complete the applicationquickly, we began documentation at a point when we &quot;thought&quot; we were close tofinishing.andP;  Most sections had to be completely rewritten during thedevelopment.andP;  Next time, we'll give only the finished product to the writer.andM;Third, get involved with the client.andP;  Keep the client involved with youduring all phases of the project.andP;  One way to encourage interest is to havethem commit funds to the design and bid specification phase.andP;  Or, if you workin a large company, you may want to require those involved to formally okaythe bid specification.andP;  Most likely, the product will reap the rewards of theclient's increased attention, and they'll get the desired result quicker.andM;Fourth, keep in mind that looks are everything.andP;  People seem to want to use aprogram that catches their eye.andM;Fifth, as one of the great business gurus said, &quot;The purpose of business isto create a customer.&quot;andP;  To us, that means you have to create value for yourclient.andP;  After many late evenings with your application, you get to know itvery, very intimately.andP;  Who makes a better representative than the person whotruly believes in the product?andP;  (If you've marketed your own applications,you know this already.)andP;  You can be a valuable asset to your client if youmake yourself available for questions and comments.andM;Peter Placey is President of Computer Resource Group, a software consultingfirm based in Santa Ana, Calif.andP;  Jeanne Klimowski handles user training anddocumentation for the group.andP;  They can be reached at (714) 532-3566.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
