General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. both boosted output this week -- the first full week of the 1988 model year.    A parts shortage forced Chrysler Corp. to close its Belvidere, Ill., assembly plant last Monday, idling 3,300 hourly employees. An official of United Auto Workers union Local 1268 in Belvidere said the unscheduled closing resulted when one of Chrysler's Canadian parts facilities &quot;couldn't keep up&quot; with Belvidere's demand for door panels.    A company spokesman declined to discuss details of the situation. Belvidere produces full-size Chrysler New Yorkers and Dodge Dynasty models. Work is scheduled to resume Monday, the spokesman said.    Chrysler expects to produce 23,200 cars this week, down almost 10% from a week ago.    General Motors resumed production at its Tarrytown, N.Y., plant last Monday after a three-week closing to cut inventories. The plant will assemble 7% fewer cars per hour than it did before the closing.    Ford planned to boost production this week to 37,300 cars, a rise of 8% from last week and up 22% from a year ago. Ford stepped up production this week of its compact Tempo and mid-size Mercury Sable and Ford Thunderbird models.    For the year to date, production by the seven U.S. auto makers was expected to reach about 5.5 million cars, down 10% from about 6.1 million assembled the previous year.    ---            This   Last   Yr.
