(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>New Products To Boost USed DEC MarketandM;DEC's continuing parade of new hardware has momentarily strengthened theused-equipment industry, giving second-hand buyers more financing option andmore models to choose from.andP;  But it has been stoking competing and frictionbetween used-equipment dealers and DEC.andM;&quot;The more hardware DEC delivers, the more hardware for the used-equipmentdealers to dispose of,&quot; said James Claypoole, president of Boston-basedused-equipment dealer Bay State Computer Group.andP;  &quot;[It's] better for the enduser,&quot; he said.andM;Despite warnings by some used-equipment dealers that heavy DEC discounting ofnew hardware will destroy the blue book value of installed VAX systems andthus weaken the entire market (see &quot;Dealers Lambaste DEC's Discounts As Outof Control,&quot; Digital Review, Feb. 20, page 1), most dealers say that, fornow, DEC's new products give buyers a wide range of affordable choices.andP;  &quot;Themore new machines DEC accrues, the more previous-generation machines willhave to find a home,&quot; Bay State's Claypoole said.andM;'Kamikaze Discounting'andM;C.D.andP;  Smith, president of the Digital Dealers Association (DDA), a worldwideorganization of companies that buy and sell DEC used equipment, last monthpublicly criticized DEC's &quot;kamikaze discounting&quot; of new hardware.andP;  Smith andDDA members charged that, in the long run, DEC will drive smaller vendors outof business by offering artificially low prices on new equipment, therebymaking used equipment less attractive.andM;But, in a private interview, Smith, who is also president of used-equipmentdealership C.D.andP;  Smith and Associates of Houston, acknowledged that DEC'srollouts of the VAX 6300 and various storage and desktop devices were alsogood for used-equipment dealers.andM;&quot;Every time DEC sells a new product, it becomes a used product the next day,&quot;he said.andP;  &quot;DEC's customer base is our customer base.&quot;andM;Behind all the political wrangling and rhetoric exchanged betweeen many DDAmembers and DEC lies a market that promises to brim with good buys on usedhardware.andM;How long it will remain that way is not clear, according to industrywatchers, but most agree these are salad days for used-equipment vendors.andM;According to used-equipment vendors, the hottest sellers are MicroVAX IIs,MicroVAX 3000s, the VAX 8000 line and HSC50 disk and tape devices.andM;Buyers can pick up a MicroVAX II for as little as $6,500, and other VAXes areavailable for big discounts below DEC list prices.andP;  Such discounts makesecond-hand hardware attractive to many universities, banks and Fortune 100companies.andM;Generally, dealers said that DEC's recent introductions of the VAX 6300series, various DECstations and VAXstations, the Micro-VAX 3300 and 3400, theHSC40 VAXcluster controller, SA650 and SA550 storage arrays and otherproducts have helped, not hurt, business.andM;Used-equipment prices are heavily influenced by supply and demand--which,according to vendors, means that prices on many models should drop over thenext year.andM;When DEC makes a new product announcement, the suply of the &quot;old product&quot;increases and prices fall, explained Dick Marks, president of MeadowlarkEnterprises of Danvers, Mass.andM;For example, DEC's 8600 was discontinued in January, Marks noted.andP;  Heestimated that the system, which cost approximately $200,000, probablydropped 25 percent in price after the announcement.andM;&quot;It will drop further, another 25 percent in three or four months,&quot; hepredicted.andM;&quot;As the [used equipment] market gets bigger and more mature, it gets morecompetitive,&quot; said John Frater, sales manager for Computer Clearing House,based in Rochester, N.Y.andM;There are no reliable, independent figures for annual sales of used DECequipment.andP;  But DDA president Smith estimates that annual sales are between$250 million and $350 million and rising.andP;  The DDA has some 111 members.andM;Dealers say that more vendors mean more competition and lower prices.andM;Bay State's Claypoole noted that, 18 months ago, a used RA81 disk drive cost$11,000.andP;  Today, the RA82s are available, making that same RA81 worth $7,000in the used-equipment marketplace, Claypoole said.andM;Because competition is so intense, many used-equipment vendors are hesitantto quote prices for publication.andP;  Most used-equipment companies are privatelyheld, so they do not have the publicize sales figures.andM;&quot;The industry is constantly changing,&quot; a situation that affects the secondarymarket almost immediately, said Kate McCanna, manager of public relations andadvertising for Data 3 of Minneapolis.andM;A VAX-11/785 system may cost $100,000 one week, and two weeks later, it maybe priced at half that, she said.andM;Leasing Gains PopularityandM;Heavy competition in the DEC used-equipment market also has led to new,innovative leasing or lease-to-buy programs.andM;One dealer, SUSco of Salem, Mass., last July began offering short- andmedium-term rentals from one month to 18 months with options to buy,according to Nick Meek, vice president of SUSco, a subsidiary of Second UserSystems, a British VAX reseller.andM;SUSco rents a VAX 3600 DV360 T1-AA, priced at $91,000, for $7,995 a month.andM;SUSco sells the 824BC-AE for $72,000 and leases it for $4,795 a month.andP;  TheDECmate II, LQPO2 andamp; LQPX2-SF andamp; PCXXF-BA costs $895 and rents for $65 a month.andM;VAX 8650s, laser printers and MicroVAXes are popular rentals, he said.andM;According to Reg Rogers, account manager to El Camino Resources, aused-equipment dealer based in Northridge, Calif., most companies terminatetheir leases early if they need more CPU power, then buy the equipment andupgrade it.andM;As a result of tighter competition, several DEC-maket used-equipment dealersare also beginning to offer fully configured, integrated systems.andM;One such example is Bay State Computer Group.andP;  Besides buying and selling DECused equipment, Bay State is also an OEM for Control Data Corp. (CDC) andEmulex.andP;  According to Claypoole, Bay State will configure those products withDEC systems if a customer desires.andM;A buyer might want a DEC CPU configured with a CDC printer, so the companywould &quot;integrate a solution that costs a lot less&quot; than a DEC-only offering,Claypoole explained.andM;The company also has a local Area Network division, which offers connectivityamong small networks using VAX 8350s, 8550s and other DEC systems.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
