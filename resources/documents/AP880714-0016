Republican Leader Robert H. Michel, R-Ill., said through an aideafter the House approved the measure 376-45 on Wednesday that ``thepresident will definitely sign it'' provided the Senate does notdrastically alter the bill.   ``He really has to sign it, otherwise he will cause politicalproblems for the (Republican) party,'' Rep. Robert Matsui,D-Calif., said after the bill won its strongest House support intwo years of seesaw combat over the issue.   Only four Democrats and 41 Republicans held out against the bill.   Reagan vetoed an earlier version May 24, and within hours theHouse voted 308-113 to pass it over the president's objections. Ithad cleared 312-107 in April in its best showing until Wednesday.   Senate efforts to pass the measure over Reagan's oppositionfailed June 8 to get the two-thirds needed for a veto override.   Since then, however, lawmakers have dropped a provision thatwould require companies to give employees 60-day notice ofimpending plant closings and large-scale layoffs. Reagan singledout the provision in his veto message, saying it would rob managersof the flexibility to maintain their firms in peak economic health.Sponsors called notification humane and decent.   In another move to meet Reagan's objections, the House deletedcurbs on export of Alaska oil that were contained in the bill.   Before taking up the trade bill, the House approved theplant-closings notification plan 286-136 as a separate piece oflegislation and will now send that Senate-passed measure to thepresident's desk.   In another preliminary move, the House rejected 237-183 a Micheleffort to drop features providing duty-free imports of ethanolproduced at Caribbean refineries from European and Brazilianalcohol-based products, including wine.   The bill would overhaul the system under which the United Statesimposes import restrictions to protect U.S. industries andretaliate against international trade violations.   There would be sanctions against Toshiba Corp. of Japan andKongsberg Vaapenfabrikk of Norway for selling submarine-silencingtechnology to the Soviet Union.   Depending on the outcome of the Uruguay Round of internationaltrade negotiations and other factors, the measure could generatemore than $2 billion in agricultural subsidies.   The 1980 windfall profits tax on oil company earnings would berepealed. The measure would authorize $980 million in the fiscalyear starting Oct. 1 and more funds later for retraining of workersleft jobless by plant closings, layoffs and other disruptionswhether or not they were trade-related.   A vast array of other features can be found in the 1,000-pagedocument that has been wending its way through Capitol Hill in oneform or another since the trade debate started hearing up in 1984.   The reason at that time was record trade deficits and relatedjob losses in industries hard hit by competition from imports.Since then, the situation has changed. Unemployment is at a 14-yearlow of 5.3 percent, and the monthly trade deficit has been sinking.</TEXT></DOC>
