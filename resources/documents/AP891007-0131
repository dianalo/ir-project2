It said the attacks occurred Friday in provinces north and eastof Managua. The statement did not mention rebel casualties.   Rebels, known as Contras, killed six government soldiers in anearly morning attack Wednesday on a rural military outpost.   Five Central American presidents signed an agreement in Augustdesigned to end the war and repatriate the Contras, most of whomare in bases in Honduras near the Nicaraguan border. In return theSandinista government promised to hold fair elections.   Some Contras have returned to Nicaragua, saying they plan toparticipate in the elections set for February, but others rejectedthe peace plan and said they will continue fighting.   Observers from the Organization of American States have limitedtheir movements because of the clashes. There are 52 OAS observersin Nicaragua to oversee compliance with the peace accords.   The Contras have been fighting the left-wing Sandinistas since1981. They claim the Sandinistas' shift to the far left betrayedthe revolution that ousted conservative President Anastasio Somozain 1979, ending 42 years of rule by the Somoza family.</TEXT></DOC>
