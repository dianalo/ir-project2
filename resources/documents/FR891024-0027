In order to delineateurbanized areas consistently and equitably nationwide, the Census Bureauestablished specific criteria when it first created these areas for the1950 census. The Census Bureau, in consultation with data users, periodicallyreviews and revises these criteria, including a review before each decennialcensus. The following criteria will apply to the 50 states, the Districtof Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The Census Bureau mayapply these criteria to other areas as well. Because the Census Bureau identifies and tabulates data for urbanized areassolely for the purpose of statistical presentation and comparison, it doesnot take into account or attempt to anticipate any nonstatistical usesthat may be made of these areas or their associated data, nor does it attemptto meet the requirements of any such nonstatistical program uses. Nonetheless,the Census Bureau recognizes that some Federal and state agencies are requiredby statute to use the Census Bureau-defined urbanized areas for allocatingprogram funds, setting program standards, and implementing other aspectsof their programs. The agencies that make such nonstatistical uses of theareas and data should be aware that the changes to the urbanized area criteriaalso may affect the implementation of their programs.If a Federal or state agency voluntarily uses the urbanized areas or theirassociated data in a nonstatistical program, it is the agency's responsibilityto ensure that the results are appropriate for such use. In consideringthe appropriateness of such nonstatistical program uses, the Census Bureauurges each agency to consider permitting appropriate modifications of theurbanized area results specifically for purposes of its program. When aprogram permits such modifications, the Census Bureau urges each agencyto use descriptive terminology that clearly avoids confusion with the CensusBureau's official urbanized areas.The Census Bureau proposes to use the following criteria and the resultsof the 1990 Census of Population and Housing \1\<NOTE/> to determine what territory qualifies for designation asan urbanized area, and what the boundaries, central place(s), and titleof each resulting urbanized area will be.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ All references to population counts and densities relateto residential data reported in the 1990 Census of Population and Housing.An urbanized area delineated as a result of a special census conductedby the Census Bureau after the 1990 census (an intercensal urbanized area),at the request and expense of local officials, will be qualified usingthese criteria and the residential population counts and densities reportedin that special census.<ITAG tagnum="84">A. Definition</ITAG>An urbanized area comprises a central place \2\<NOTE/> and the adjacent densely settled surrounding territory thattogether have a minimum population of 50,000 people.\3\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ The term ``place'' in the urbanized area criteria includesboth incorporated places, such as cities and villages, and census designatedplaces (CDPs). A CDP is an unincorporated population cluster for whichthe Census Bureau delineates boundaries in cooperation with state and localagencies to permit tabulation of data in Census Bureau products. In PuertoRico, the Census Bureau, in cooperation with the Office of the Governor,delineates and recognizes zonas urbanas and comunidades as CDP equivalentsfor use when defining cental places and applying the urbanized area criteria.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ When considering the qualification of a potential urbanizedarea, the urbanized area criteria exclude the people living in the ruralportion(s) of extended cities, as defined by applying the Census Bureau'sextended city criteria. If excluding the population of the rural portionof an extended city results in a total potential urbanized area populationof less than 50,000, the potential urbanized area does not qualify eventhough the total population of the entire city equals or exceeds 50,000.In addition, for an urbanized area to qualify, at least 25,000 of the peoplein the potential urbanized area must reside in an area that is not partof a military installation.The densely settled surrounding territory adjacent to the central placeconsists of the following: 1. Territory made up of one of more contiguous census blocks having a populationdensity of at least 1,000 people per square mile,\4\<NOTE/> provided that it is: <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ A census block is an area identified by a unique numberon Census Bureau maps used for a decennial or special census. Such areasnormally are bounded by physical features shown on those maps, such asstreets, streams, and railroads. The boundaries of a census block alsomay consist of nonvisible feature(s) such as the boundary of an incorporatedplace, minor civil division, county, or other 1990 census tabulation areaboundary. Population density is calculated by dividing the total populationof the census block(s) by the land area of that block(s). The Census Bureau'scalculation of population density generally excludes the area of certainlarge nonresidential urban land use areas such as railroad yards, industrialareas, airports, cemeteries, and golf courses shown on the Census Bureau'smaps.a. Contiguous with and directly connected by road to other qualifying territory,or b. Noncontiguous with other qualifying territory; and: (1) Within 1\1/2\ road miles of the main body of the urbanized area, andconnected to it by one or more nonqualifying census blocks that (a) areadjacent to the connecting road and (b) together with the outlying qualifyingterritory have a total population density of at least 500 people per squaremile,\5\<NOTE/> or<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ The Census Bureau will not include additional noncontiguousarea in the urbanized area if the connection required to include it containsterritory already qualified under this criterion.(2) Separated by water or other undevelopable territory \6\<NOTE/> from the main body of the urbanized area, but within 5 roadmiles of the main body of the urbanized area as long as no more than 1\1/2\miles of otherwise nonqualifying developable territory intervenes.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ For purposes of these criteria, undevelopable territoryincludes only mud flats, marshlands, steep slopes, and other terrain onwhich development is virtually impossible because of physical limitations.To be classified as undevelopable, the territory must not contain any existinghousing or commercial structures. Military installations, parks, and forestpreserves shown on the Census Bureau's maps at the time of the decennialor special census also may be classified as undevelopable territory. Theland-use zoning of an area is not considered when applying this criterion.2. A place containing any territory qualifying on the basis of criterionA.1 will be included in the urbanized area in its entirety (or partially,if the place is and extended city \7\)<NOTE/> if that qualifiying territory includes at least 50 percentof the population of the place. If the place does not contain any territoryqualifying on the basis of the above criterion, or if that qualifying territoryincludes less than 50 percent of the place's population, the place is excludedin its entirety.\8\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ Only the urban portion of an incorporated place qualifiesto be included in the urbanized area if the place qualifies as an extendedcity. An incorporated place is defined as an extended city if it containsone or more sparsely settled areas, each at least 5 square miles in landarea and having a population density of fewer than 100 people per squaremile. The sparsely settled area(s) must total at least 25 percent of theland area of the incorporated place or encompass more than 25 square miles.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ A place included in an urbanized area designated as aresult of an earlier decennial or special census is retained in the urbanizedarea in its entirety even if it does not meet this criterion, unless itnewly qualifies as an extended city.3. Other territory with a population density of fewer than 1,000 peopleper square mile, provided that it:a. Eliminates an enclave of no more than 5 square miles in the otherwisequalifying urbanized areas when the surrounding territory qualifies onthe basis of population density, or b. Closes an indentation in the boundary of the otherwise qualifying urbanizedareas when the contiguous territory qualifies on the basis of populationdensity, provided that the indentation is no more than 1 mile across theopen end, has a depth at least two times greater than the distance acrossthe open end, and encompasses no more than 5 square miles.<ITAG tagnum="84">B. Urbanized Area Central Places</ITAG>One or more urbanized area central places function as the dominant centersof each urbanized area. The identification of urbanized area central placespermits the comparison of these dominant centers with the remaining territoryin the urbanized area.Urbanized areas are closely related to metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs)\9\<NOTE/> in that most urbanized area(s) form the continuously built-upcore of MSAs. However, some MSAs included two or more noncontiguous urganizedareas, and some urbanized areas exist outside of MSAs. The Census Bureauidentifies one or more central places for each urbanized area. If the urbanizedarea encompasses all the central cities of a single MSA, then the centralplace(s) of the urbanized area generally will be the same as the centralcity(ies) of the corresponding MSA.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ The term MSA, as used in these criteria, refers to a freestandingMSA or one of the primary metropolitan statistical areas (PMSAs) withina consolidated metropolitan statistical area (CMSA) as designated by theFederal Office of Management and Budget (OMB). In the titling criteria,the term also refers to a CMSA when the CMSA mostly encompasses an urbanizedarea. The MSA central cities and titles used to determine urbanized areacentral places and titles are those in effect on January 1, 1990 and, forthose areas qalifying as new MSAs based on the results of the 1990 census,the central cities and titles included in the 1990 census data products.Changes to the list of central cities and titles of existing MSAs basedon the results of the 1990 census are not included, because such changesoccur after the release of the 1990 census data. The Census Bureau willnot change the list of existing central places and titles of urbanizedareas as a result of any subsequent MSA central city or title changes untilafter the next national census. The Census Bureau will determine the centralplaces(s) and title of each qualifying intercensal urbanized area at thetime of qualification based on the 1990 criteria. Urbanized area title,except for those titled under criterion C.4, include only place and statenames.Urbanized area central places include:1. Those MSA central cities entirely (or partially, if the place is anextended city \10\<NOTE/> within the urbanized area. There is no limit on the numberof qualifying central places, and not all MSA central cities necessarilyare included in the urbanized area title.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ Only the urban portion of an extended city is classifiedas central.2. If the urbanized area does not contain an MSA central city, or is outsideof an MSA, then the central place(s) is any place(s) that qualifies asspecified in criterion C.2 and C.3 of the urbanized area titling criteria.One or two additional places may qualify as central under criterion C.2of the urbanized area titling criteria. Only one place may qualify as centralwithin an urbanized area under criterion C.3 of the urbanized area titlingcriteria.<ITAG tagnum="84">C. Urbanized Area Titles and Codes</ITAG>The title of an urbanized area identifies those places that are most importantwithin the urbanized area; it links the urbanized area to the encompassingMSA, where appropriate. If a single MSA mostly encompasses the urbanizedarea, then the title and code of the urbanized area generally are the sameas the title and code of the MSA. If the urbanized area is not mostly encompassedin a single MSA, if it does not include any places that are central citiesin the encompassing MSA, or if it is not part of an MSA, then the CensusBureau uses the population size of the included places, with a preferencefor incorporated places, to determine the urbanized area title. The nameof the state (or states) in which the urbanized area is located also isused in each urbanized area title.The following criteria determine urbanized area titles and codes:1. The title consist of the same places named in the encompassing MSA whenthe urbanized area exists mostly within a single MSA as of the 1990 census,provided that the places in the MSA title are located entirely (or partially,if the places are extended cities) within the boundaries of the urbanizedarea. Any MSA title city(ies) not located in the urbanized area is omittedfrom the urbanized area title.2. If the urbanized area does not contain any place that meets criterionC.1, then the urbanized area title includes the name of the most populousincorporated place in the urbanized area containing 2,500 or more peopleand the names of up to two additional incorporated places in the urbanizedarea, provided that each additional place has a population of 15,000 ormore, and has at least one-third the population of the most populous incorporatedplace in the urbanized area.This criterion also is used to determine the title of an urbanized areathat is not mostly encompassed within a single MSA or where a single MSAencompasses more than one separate urbanized area, each centered on a separateMSA title city; that is, (a) those urbanized areas mostly within two ormore PMSAs, but not within all constituent PMSAs of the CMSA, or (b) thoseurbanized areas that include one or more MSA title cities and for whichother separate urbanized areas exist around one or more other MSA titlecities. In these instances, the names used in the title of the urbanizedarea are restricted to MSA central cities that meet the population sizecriteria.3. If the urbanized area does not contain any incorporated place with apopulation of 2,500 or more, the urbanized area title includes only thename of the largest nonmilitary place.\11\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ A nonmilitary place is one in which more than 50 percentof the population lives outside the boundaries of a military installation.4. A regional title may be used to identify an urbanized area with a populationof one million or more, if the Census Bureau believes a regional titleprovides an unambiguous description of the area. Regional titles includeonly the name of the largest city in the urbanized area, followed by theregional title.5. The order of place names within an urbanized area title is the sameas the order of the central city names in the MSA title for urbanized areasthat have places that qualify under titling criterion C.1, excluding placesnot contained in the urbanized area. For urbanized areas that are entitledunder criterion C.2, the place names within the urbanized area title arelisted in descending order of population.6. In addition to the name of each qualifying place (including the placename in the regional title), the urbanized area title includes the nameof each state into which the urbanized area extends. The order of statenames is:a. The same as the order of their related place names mentioned in theurbanized area title, followed by,b. The names of other states into which the urbanized area extends in descendingorder of the state's population in the urbanized area.7. The numeric code used to identify each urbanized area will be the sameas the code for the mostly encompassing MSA (including CMSA and PMSA).If MSA title cities represent multiple urbanized areas, or the urbanizedarea title city does not correspond to the first name of an MSA title,the Census Bureau will assign a code based on the alphabtical sequenceof the urbanized area title in relationship to all other urbanized areaand MSA titles.<ITAG tagnum="84">D. Retention of Boundaries, Contiguity, and Merger of Urbanized Areas</ITAG>As with the identification of central places and titles, the Census Bureauuses the geographic structure of MSAs (including CMSAs and PMSAs) to determinewhen to define separate contiguous urbanized areas \12\<NOTE/> or to merge contiguous urbanized areas. After delineatingthe boundaries of each urbanized area, the Census Bureau examines the relationshipbetween the urbanized area and any contiguous urbanized area(s) using thecriteria below to determine if each contiguous urbanized area should berecognized separately and, if so, where the boundary should be betweenthese urbanized areas.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ The Census Bureau considers two urbanized areas to becontiguous if they share a common boundary line (not simply a point), andthe areas on both sides of this shared boundary qualify for inclusion intheir respective urbanized areas based on the minimum population densitycriterion of 1,000 people per square mile. Urbanized areas that are separatedby no more than 5 miles of undevelopable land or water, but are connectedby road, are considered contiguous if both include areas meeting the populationdensity criterion at the points where they adjoin the undevelopable landor water and the qualifying road connection exists.1. An urbanized area generally retains all territory previously includedwithin its boundaries. When a previously existing urbanized area becomescontiguous with another urbanized area, the Census Bureau generally willnot move previously qualifying territory from that urbanized area intothe contiguous urbanized area.\13\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\13\ The Census Bureau unavoidably may have to delete previouslyqualifying territory from an urbanized area or shift previously qualifyingterritory from one urbanized area to another when there has been a changein a place boundary (due to a detachment from or disincorporation of anincorporated place or a retraction from or deletion of a CDP), a changein a county or minor civil division boundary, or the deletion of a featurepreviously used as a census block boundary.2. When previously noncontiguous urbanized areas become contiguous, theCensus Bureau will choose a prominent physical feature or political boundaryto use as the boundary separating the two urbanized areas. The featureor political boundary selected will be at or near the location of the lowestoverall population density between the two areas.3. No new urbanized area will be created from the territory of an existingurbanized area, even if one or more MSAs or PMSAs subsequently are establishedthat subdivide the original territory of the urbanized area.4. If the boundary used to separate two contiguous urbanized areas followsa political boundary that also is an MSA boundary, the urbanized area boundarywill continue to follow that political boundary even if the MSA boundarysubsequently changes.5. When urbanized areas are contiguous, the Census Bureau will use thefollowing criteria to determine if a merger occurs:a. The Census Bureau merges urbanized areas when:(1) Two or more newly qualifying urbanized areas are contiguous and aremostly in the same MSA or PMSA.(2) A newly qualifying urbanized area is contiguous to an existing urbanizedarea and both are mostly in the same MSA or PMSA.(3) Previously existing urbanized areas mostly in the same MSA or PMSAbecome contiguous.(4) Existing contiguous urbanized areas, previously entirely or mostlyin different MSAs, become entirely or mostly part of the same MSA or PMSAbecause of an MSA merger.b. The Census Bureau does not merge urbanized areas when:(1) Existing urbanized areas are contiguous or become contiguous and areentirely or mostly in different MSAs or PMSAs.(2) Existing urbanized areas are contiguous or become contiguous and aremostly in the same CMSA but mostly in different PMSAs.(3) Existing urbanized areas are contiguous or become contiguous and thelargest central place of one of the urbanized areas is mostly outside theencompassing MSA.<ITAG tagnum="85">Differences Between the Proposed 1990 Urbanized Area Criteria andthe 1980 Urbanized Area Critreria</ITAG>The following is a summary of the differences between the 1980 urbanizedarea criteria and the urbanized area criteria proposed for the 1990 census.1. The Census Bureau will recognize an urbanized area if it contains aplace, either incorporated or census designated. Previously, the CensusBureau required a potential urbanized area to contain an incorporated place(except in Hawaii and Puerto Rico, where incorporated places do not occurin the sense of functioning local governmental units). In line with thisproposed change, the Census Bureau will replace the term ``central city''with ``central place.''2. The Census Bureau will add an entire place to an urbanized area onlyif the qualifying portion is adjacent to or within 1\1/2\ road miles ofthe rest of the urbanized area and the qualifying portion contains at least50 percent of the population of the place. Previously, a place had to containonly a closely settled area that included at least 50 percent of the populationof the place, or a cluster of at least 100 housing units, if the placedid not have a population of at least 2,500 or a population density ofat least 1,000 people per square mile.3. The combined population density of any noncontiguous qualifying areaand the intervening nonqualifying census block(s) added to the urbanizedarea must be at least 500 people per square mile. There must be at leastone census block that is contiguous to the road connecting the qualifyingcore area with the noncontiguous qualifying area. Previously, there wasno stated minimum population density requirement for adding any noncontiguousqualfying area and the intervening nonqualifying blocks to the urbanizedarea, but the Census Bureau used this proposed criterion as a guidelinein the past.4. The Census Bureau will close urbanized area boundary indentations onlywhen the depth of the area is at least two times greater than a line closingthe opening. This criterion applies only when the indented area withinthe urbanized area is surrounded by area meeting the population densityrequirements of 1,000 people per square mile. Previously, the Census Bureaugenerally closed any indentation less than 1 mile across the open end andencompassing no more than 5 square miles.5. The Census Bureau no longer will add to an urbanized area the territorythat contains a large concentration of nonresidential urban land use (suchas an industrial park, office complex, or major airport) and is adjacentto the urbanized area, even if at least one-quarter of the boundary ofthe land use area is contiguous with the urbanized area. The Census Bureaudoes not have sufficient information to implement this criterion consistentlyon a nationwide basis. Existing urbanized areas will retain territory thatqualified under the earlier criterion.6. In most instances, the Census Bureau will use the title of the (mostly)encompassing MSA title as the urbanized area title. If a single MSA doesnot include most of the urbanized area of if the urbanized area does notcontain any places in the title of the MSA, the Census Bureau generallywill use as an urbanized area title the names of up to three of the mostpopulous incorporated places over 2,500 population within the urbanizedarea. If no such incorporated places exist in the urbanized area, the CensusBureau will use the name of the CDP with the largest populations for theurbanized area title. The overall effect of these criteria will be to havethe titles of urbanized title. The overall effect of these criteria willbe to have the titles of urbanized areas and MSAs as similar as possible.The Census Bureau used 1970, and in come cases, 1960, urbanized area titlesas the titles of 1980 urbanized areas.7. For each urbanized area, where applicable, the Census Bureau will designateas an urbanized area central place, each place that also is a central cityin the encompassing MSA. If there is no such place in the urbanized area,the Census Bureau will designate as an urbanized area central place, eachplace in the title of the urbanized area. The general effect of these criteriawill be to have the central places of urbanized area and the central citiesof MSAs as similar as possible in the 1990 census tabulations. Previously,except in the two urbanized areas assigned regional titles, the centralcities of urbganized areas included only those places appearing in theurbanized area titles.8. All crriteria related to delineating a boundary between contiguous urbanizedareas and to merging contiguous urbanized areas are new. While the CensusBureau generally used the proposed criteria as ``guidelines'' in the past,it did not previously publish these as criteria. These criteria will resultin the merger of the following 1980 urbanized areas for the 1990 census:<ITAG tagnum="25">New Heaven, CT and Meriden, CT</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Nortfolk-Portsmount, VA and Newport News-Hampton, VA</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Richmond, VA and Petersburg-Colonial Heights, VA</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Tampa, FL and St. Petersburg, FL</ITAG>In addition, the criteria could result in the merger of other 1980 urbanizedareas for the 1990 census, if their urbanized areas become contiguous andare in the same MSA or PMSA. In 1980, the following urbanized areas werewithin 2 miles of each other and mostly in the same MSA or PMSA:<ITAG tagnum="25">Aurora, IL and Elgin, IL</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Baltimore, MD and Annapolis, MD</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Beaumont, TX and Port Arthur, TX</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Greensboro, NC and High Point, NC</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Johnson City, TN and Kingsport, TN_VA</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Kingsport, TN_VA and Bristol, TN_Bristol, VA</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Macon, GA and Warner Robins, GA</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Oxnard_Ventura_Thousand Oaks, CA and Simi Valley, CA</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">St. Louis, MO_IL and Alton, IL</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">San Juan, PR and Vega Baja_ManatiandCx.174;1 PR</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES:</T2> Comments submitted on or before December 26, 1989 willreceive consideration in developing the final urbanized area criteria forthe 1990 census.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES:</T2> Persons wishing to comment or obtain additional informationshould write to: Mr. Robert W.
