Miller, director of the Office of Management and Budget, and Prof. Mark Crain (&quot;Item-Reduction Veto's Wallop,&quot; editorial page, June 8) that based on the states' experience, giving the president a simple line-item veto of the budget might not have any significant effect on the growth of federal spending is a major contribution to the debate. It makes clear that the major thrust of the simple line-item veto proposal is to grant the president greater control over the structure of the budget than the Constitution provides rather than furnishing him with a deficit-limiting measure.    To correct this Messrs. Miller and Crain suggest three additions to the conventional (binary) line-item veto: 1) A so-called &quot;item-reduction veto&quot; allowing the president to reduce the spending level of a particular budget item; 2) requiring a super-majority to pass tax increases, and 3) a requirement that all funds be appropriated by Congress annually. This, in effect, would eliminate entitlement programs. Congress would then decide each year how much funds would be allocated for such programs as Social Security, federal pensions, veteran benefits, Medicare, etc. The sum total of these changes would give the president almost complete control over the federal budget and certainly simplify the task of OMB, which explains Congress's opposition to such schemes.    What Messrs. Miller and Crain are proposing is a constitutional reform that would greatly increase the power of the president over the budget at the expense of Congress, contrary to what the Founding Fathers envisioned. It would be a great mistake if, in our fervor to eliminate the budget deficit, we made some fundamental changes in our form of government without a proper consideration of all the far-reaching consequences.
