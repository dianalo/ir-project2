<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-35-0795 </DOCNO><TEXT>Some areas of radiation genetics still contain gaps of knowledge, as thesestudies lost priority when the emphasis in experimental mutagenesis shiftedtoward the effect of chemical mutagens. This shifted emphasis, however,was accompanied by the development of a better understanding of geneticinjury at the molecular level. At the opposite end of the spectrum, moreattention was paid to estimates of the direct health costs of the geneticburden in humans and the capacity to make prenatal diagnoses, and toconsider reasonable clinical and biochemical intervention. Although,as yet, there are no completely reliable direct methods to estimate theradiation-induced mutation rate in humans, we have come to rely upondata from experimental animals to predict event frequency and extrapolatefrom these data to predict human health consequences. What will the futureoffer? Certainly, we should develop a better understanding of moleculargenetic damage and, possibly, a better extrapolation model for predictingmutation rate, but many aspects of expected health consequences may remainelusive. We still may have to rely upon (1) an inadequate human populationgenetic baseline, (2) sometimes arguable perceptions of man-mouse extrapolationmodels, (3) changing perceptions of gene-environment interactions, and(4) changing levels of short-term selection pressure against detrimentalmutations.</TEXT></DOC>
