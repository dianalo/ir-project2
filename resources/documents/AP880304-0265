IBM's unusual statement was in reaction to an article Friday inthe Wall Street Journal that quoted William C. Lowe, the vicepresident in charge of personal computers, on IBM's plans for itsPersonal System-2 line.   Siemens executives ``were very disturbed by what appeared in theJournal,'' but the statement Friday will probably help matters,said Martin Weitzner, a spokesman for Siemens' U.S. operations.   According to the Journal, Lowe said that if a pact was reached,Siemens would either license or buy from IBM the crucial parts ofIBM's PS-2 line and incorporate them into its own computers. Lowesaid it was even possible that some companies might buy PS-2computers whole and sell them under their own labels.   The Journal said IBM was in similar talks with Ing. C. Olivettiandamp; Co. of Italy, but IBM said that Lowe had only mentioned Olivettias an example of a company that could be considered.   Such deals would be a major departure for IBM, whichtraditionally keeps a tight grip on its own technology. But theymight benefit the company by helping establish the PersonalSystem-2 as an industry standard.</TEXT></DOC>
