They reflect changes made by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA'86) and conform the regulations to sections 1114(a) and 1115 of the TaxReform Act of 1986 (100 Stat. 2448 and 2453). These regulations will providethe public with guidance necessary to comply with the law and would affectsponsors of, and participants in, pension, profit-sharing and stock bonusplans, and certain other employee benefit plans.

Marks of the EmployeePlans and Exempt Organizations Division, Office of the Chief Counsel, InternalRevenue Service, 1111 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20224 (Attention:CC:LR:T) (202-566-3938) (not a toll-free number).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>supplementary information:</T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>This document amends the Income Tax Regulations (26 CFR Part 1) by addingnew andSection;andSection; 1.414(q)-1T and 1.414(s)-1T to provide guidancewith respect to the definitions of highly compensated employee and compensationwithin the meaning of Internal Revenue Code section 414 (q) and (s).<ITAG tagnum="84">Amendments to Qualified Plans</ITAG>Generally, subsections (q) and (s) of section 414 are definitional provisionsthat do not, of themselves, require plan amendments or impose operationalrequirements. However, in order to meet the requirements for qualification,plans are required to contain provisions designed to meet certain statutoryrequirements that rely on these definitions. Therefore, amendments willgenerally be necessary to conform plans to these definitions.The definitions contained in subsections (q) and (s) of section 414 aregenerally effective for years beginning on or after January 1, 1987. Nevertheless,subject to certain conditions, a plan will not be disqualified solely becauseit is not amended to the extent necessary to conform to these definitionsprior to the close of the amendment period contained in section 1140 ofTRA '86. This delayed date for conforming amendments is conditioned ona requirement that such plan amendments are adopted retroactively to thelater of the first day of the first plan year beginning after December31, 1986, or the relevant effective date for the plan provisions to whichthese definitions are applicable. In addition, plans must satisfy the statutoryrequirements of applicable sections that incorporate these definitionsin operation, beginning with the effective date for such requirements,notwithstanding the absence of plan provisions. For example, a plan towhich the nondiscrimination tests of section 401(k)(3) or 401(m)(2) applymust satisfy these tests on the basis of comparisons between the groupof highly compensated employees as defined in section 414(q) and the groupof all other employees beginning with plan years beginning after December31, 1986, except to the extent that the optional transition rule of andSection;1.414(q)-1T Question and Answer (A) 15 is applicable. In contrast, theprovisions of the coverage requirements of section 410(b), as amended bysection 1112(a) of the TRA '86, which provisions contain tests based inpart on groups of employees who are highly compensated employees withinthe meaning of section 414(q), are generally effective for plan years beginningafter December 31, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="84">Amendment Date for Elective Provisions</ITAG>These temporary regulations with respect to sections 414(q) and (s) providefor certain elections that require corresponding plan provisions. Any amendmentsnecessary to adopt such plan provisions may be made by the section 1140delayed effective date in the same manner as amendments required with respectto TRA '86.<ITAG tagnum="84">Optional Transition Rule for 1987 and 1988</ITAG>A-15 of andSection; 1.414(q)-1T provides that certain employers with planssubject to the nondiscrimination requirements of section 401(k)(3) or plansthat are subject to section 401(m)(2) may elect an optional transitionrule in determining the group of ``highly compensated employees'' for purposesof applying these requirements to plan years beginning in 1987 or 1988.This elective rule is applicable solely to the transition period endingbefore the first plan year beginning on or after January 1, 1989. Thus,this elective rule may be used for the 1987 and 1988 determination yearcalculations and the corresponding 1986 and 1987 look-back year calculationsfor the 1987 and 1988 determination years. It may not, however, be usedfor the 1989 determination year calculation or the 1988 look-back yearcalculation with respect to the 1989 determination year. This rule is designedto reduce the potential administrative difficulties employers might experiencein attempting to reconstruct data and initiate new compensation reportingsystems for the transition period.<ITAG tagnum="84">Definition of Highly Compensated Employees</ITAG>These temporary regulations under section 414(q) provide rules for determiningwhich employees are ``highly compensated employees''. This term is usedin various Code sections relating to qualified retirement plans, qualifiedcash or deferred arrangements, and certain other employee benefit plansfor the purpose of determining whether these plans discriminate in favorof such employees. The term is also used in Code provisions that imposespecific tax consequences on highly compensated employees. <T3>See, e.g.,</T3> sections 402(b)(2) and 89(a)(1). This definition isgenerally applicable only to sections that incorporate the new definitionof highly compensated employees by reference.This regulation provides for two categories of highly compensated employees:highly compensated active employees and highly compensated former employees.The determination of whether such employees are active or former employeesis made on the basis of whether or not the individual performed servicesfor the employer during the determination year. Generally, the group ofhighly compensated active employees consists of individuals who, at anytime during the determination year, or the preceding year, were either:5-percent owners of the employer; compensated by the employer in an amountabove $75,000; compensated by the employer in an amount above $50,000 andwithin the top 20 percent of employees ranked by compensation paid by theemployer; or officers of the employer whose compensation is above a certainlevel. The definition of highly compensated employees set forth in A-2(b)of these regulations anticipates that a technical correction indexing thethreshold $75,000 and $50,000 dollar amounts at the same time and in thesame manner as the section 415(b)(1)(A) dollar limitation for defined benefitplans will be enacted, with retroactive effect. Applying this rule, theindexed thereshold dollar amounts for 1988 are $78,353 and $52,235 respectively.An elective special rule is provided for purposes of administrative simplicityin determining whether employees who left employment prior to the effectivedate of section 414(q) are highly compensated former employees. The regulationsstate that highly compensated active and former employees are to be identifiedon an employer-wide basis, taking into account the aggregation rules ofsection 414(b), (c), (m), and (o) and the rules with respect to leasedand other deemed employees contained in section 414 (n) and (o). The regulationsfurther provide that the threshold dollar amounts used in determining whois highly compensated employee are indexed to reflect changes in the costof living at the same time and in the same manner as the section 415(b)(1)(A)limitation with respect to defined benefit plans.Special rules are provided in the regulations for making determinationswith respect to; (1) Which employees are officers and includible as highlycompensated employees; (2) the manner in which the determination of highlycompensated employees is made for the current year; (3) former employees;and (4) family aggregation.The regulations do not include rules applicable to the identification ofthe highly compensated employees when there are changes in the compositionof the employer due to mergers, acquisitions, divisive reorganizations,and similar business transactions. The Internal Revenue Service requestscomments and suggestions with respect to the application of section 414(q)and these regulations to such situations. The Service plans to issue proposedrules on such situations later this year.The regulations provide, where appropriate, that the definitions providedherein apply only to the definition of highly compensated employees insection 414(q) and these regulations. In addition, the specific rules withrespect to family aggregation and the inclusion or exclusion of certaincategories of employees (e.g. former employees and employees covered undera collective bargaining agreement) apply only to the extent not otherwiseprovided in regulations prescribed under sections that incorporate thedefinition of highly compensated employees.<ITAG tagnum="84">Relationship to Title I of ERISA  </ITAG>The primary purpose of section 414(q) of the Internal Revenue Code is toprovide objective rules for identifying those employees of an employerwho are to be treated as highly compensated employees in determining whetheran employer-maintained retirement or other employee benefit plan impermissiblydiscriminates in favor of highly compensated employees. Nondiscriminationis a condition to many of the tax advantages provided with respect to suchplans.  Some have inquired about whether section 414(q) is applicable with respectto the determination under sections 201(2), 301(a)(3), and 401(a)(1) ofERISA when an employee benefit plan is ``maintained by an employer primarilyfor the purposes of providing deferred compensation for a select groupof management or highly compensated employees.'' The Department of Laborhas jurisdiction over the interpretation of these provisions. However,the Department of the Treasury would like to clarify its understandingthat section 414(q) is not determinative with respect to provisions ofTitle I of ERISA, other than those provisions that explicitly incorporatesuch section by reference (e.g., section 408(b)(1)(B) of ERISA). The Departmentsof Treasury and Labor concur in the view that a broad extension of section414(q) to determinations under sections 201(2), 301(a)(3), and 401(a)(1)of ERISA would be inconsistent with the tax and retirement policy objectivesof encouraging employers to maintain tax-qualified plans that provide meaningfulbenefits to rank-and-file employees.<ITAG tagnum="84">Definition of Compensation  </ITAG>Generally, the term ``compensation'' as defined in section 414(s) meanscompensation, other than qualified or previously qualified deferred compensation,received for services performed for the employer that is currently includiblein gross income for income tax purposes. This definition is generally applicablefor Part I of Subchapter D of the Code, sections 401 through 419A, forpurposes of applying the nondiscrimination rules (including the actualdeferral percentage limits for cash or deferred arrangements and for employeeand employer matching contributions). This section 414(s) definition ofcompensation is not applicable to sections that provide for another definitionof compensation. For example, provisions to which this definition is notapplicable include section 414(q) and section 415 for purposes of applyingthe section 415 limits on contributions and benefits except to the extentapplicable to the section 415(c)(6) special rule with respect to employeestock ownership plans. A definition of compensation with respect to self-employedindividuals is provided in A-2. These regulations also provide exceptionsand alternatives to the section 414(s) definition of compensation in A-3and A-4 of these regulations. Included among these alternatives is a provisionpermitting use of the section 415(c) definition of compensation. In thiscontext, the Service contemplates revising the regulations with respectto section 415(c) and invites comment with respect to the section 415(c)definition of compensation as amended by TRA '86. The regulations alsoprovide a delegation of authority to the Commissioner to provide for additionalalternative definitions of compensation for purposes of section 414(s).It is anticipated that this delegation to the Commissioner will be exercisedin the form of revenue rulings, Internal Revenue Bulletin notices or otherInternal Revenue Service publications of general applicability.<ITAG tagnum="84">Effective Date of These Regulations  </ITAG>These regulations are generally effective for plan years beginning on orafter January 1, 1987, except as otherwise specified in TRA '86.<ITAG tagnum="84">Special Analyses  </ITAG>The Commissioner of Internal Revenue has determined that this temporaryrule is not a major rule as defined in Executive Order 12291 and that aregulatory impact analysis is not required. A general notice of proposedrulemaking is not required by 5 U.S.C. 553 for temporary regulations. Accordingly,the temporary regulations do not constitute regulations subject to theRegulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6).<ITAG tagnum="84">Drafting Information</ITAG>The principal author of these temporary regulations is Nancy J.

See the respective sections for theapplicable effective dates.(d) <T3>ERISA. </T3>This definition is not determinative with respect to anyprovisions of Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of1974 (ERISA), unless it is explicitly incorporated by reference (e.g.,section 408(b)(1)(B)).Q-2: Who is a highly compensated employee?A-2: The group of employees (including former employees) who are highlycompensated employees consists of both highly compensated active employees(see A-3 of this andSection; 1.414(q)-1T) and highly compensated former employees(see A-4 of this andSection; 1.414(q)-1T). In many circumstances, highlycompensated active employees and highly compensated former employees areconsidered separately in applying the provisions for which the definitionof highly compensated employees in section 414(q) is applicable. Specificrules with respect to the treatment of highly compensated active employeesand highly compensated former employees will be provided in the regulationswith respect to the sections to which the definition of highly compensatedemployees is applicable.Q-3: Who is a highly compensated active employee?A-3: (a) <T3>General rule. </T3>For purposes of the year for which the determinationis being made (the determination year), a highly compensated active employeeis any employee who, with respect to the employer, performs services duringthe determination year and is described in any one or more of the followinggroups applicable with respect to the look-back year calculation and/ordetermination year calculation for such determination year. See A-14 forrules relating to the periods for which the look-back year calculationand determination year calculation are to be made.(1) <T3>Look-back year calculation.</T3>(i) <T3>5-percent owner. </T3>The employee is a 5-percent owner at any timeduring the look-back year (i.e., generally, the 12-month period immediatelypreceding the determination year; see A-14. (See A-8 of this andSection;1.414(q)-1T.)(ii) <T3>Compensation above $75,000. </T3>The employee receives compensationin excess of $75,000 during the look-back year.(iii) <T3>Compensation above $50,000 and top-paid group. </T3>The employee receivescompensation in excess of $50,000 during the look-back year and is a memberof the top-paid group for the look-back year. (See A-9 of this andSection;1.414(q)-1T.)(iv) <T3>Officer. </T3>The employee is an ``includible officer'' during thelook-back year. (See A-10 of this andSection; 1.414(q)-1T.)(2) <T3>Determination year calculation.</T3>(i) <T3>5-percent owner. </T3>The employee is a 5-percent owner at any timeduring the determination year. (See A-8 of this andSection; 1.414(q)-1T.)(ii) <T3>Top-100 employees. </T3>The employee is both (A) described in paragraph(a)(1)(i), (ii) and/or (iv) of this A-3, when such paragraphs are modifiedto substitute the determination year for the look-back year, and (B) oneof the 100 employees who receive the most compensation from the employerduring the determination year.(b) <T3>Rounding and tie-breaking rules. </T3>In making the look-back yearand determination year calculations for a determination year, it may benecessary for an employer to adopt a rule for rounding calculations (e.g.,in determining the number of employees in the top-paid group). In addition,it may be necessary to adopt a rule breaking ties among two or more employees(e.g., in identifying those particular employees who are in the top-paidgroup or who are among the 100 most highly compensated employees). In suchcases, the employer may adopt any rounding or tie-breaking rules it desires,so long as such rules are reasonable, nondiscriminatory, and uniformlyand consistently applied.(c) <T3>Adjustments to dollar thresholds</T3>_(1) <T3>Indexing of dollar thresholds.</T3> The dollar amounts in paragraph(a)(1) (i) and (ii) of this A-3 are indexed at the same time and in thesame manner as the section 415(b)(1)(A) dollar limitation for defined benefitplans.(2) <T3>Applicable dollar threshold.</T3> The applicable dollar amount fora particular determination year or look-back year is the dollar amountfor the calendar year in which such determination year or look-back yearbegins. Thus, the dollar amount for purposes of determining the highlycompensated active employees for a particular look-back year is based onthe calendar year in which such look-back year begins, not the calendaryear in which such look-back year ends or in which the determination yearwith respect to such look-back year begins.(d) <T3>Employees described in more than one group.</T3> An individual whois a highly compensated active employee for a determination year, by reasonof being described in one group in paragraph (a) of this A-3, under eitherthe look-back year calculation or the determination year calculation, isnot disregarded in determining whether another individual is a highly compensatedactive employee by reason of being described in another group under paragraph(a). For example, an individual who is a highly compensated active employeefor a determination year, by reason of being a 5-percent owner during suchyear, who receives compensation in excess of $50,000 during both the look-backyear and the determination year, is taken into account in determining thegroup of employees who are highly compensated active employees for suchdetermination year by reason of receiving more than $50,000, and beingin the top-paid group under either or both the look-back year calculationor determination year calculation for such determination year.(e) <T3>Examples.</T3> The following examples, in which the determination yearand look-back year are the calendar year, are illustrative of the rulesin paragraph (a) of this A-3. For purposes of these examples, the thresholddollar amounts in paragraph (a)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this A-3 are not increasedpursuant to paragraph (c) of this A-3.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (1).</T3> Employee A, who is not at any time a 5-percent owner,an officer, or a member of the top-100 within the meaning of paragraph(a)(1) (i), or (iv), or (a)(2) (i) or (ii), but who was a member of thetop-paid group for each year, is included in or excluded from the highlycompensated groups as specified below for the following years:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,tp0,i1,xs84,12,xs84,r200</C> <H1>Year</H1><H1>Compensation</H1><H1>Status</H1><H1>Comments</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">1986 <D>$45,000 </D><D>N/A </D><D>Although prior to 414(q) effective date, 1986 constitutes the look-backyear for purposes of determining the highly compensated group for the 1987determination year.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1987 <D>80,000 </D><D>Excl </D><D>Excluded because A was not an employee described in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) or (iii) of this A-3 for the look-back year (1986).</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1988 <D>80,000 </D><D>Incl </D><D>Included because A was an employee described in paragraph (a)(1) (ii)or (iii) of this A-3 for the look-back year (1987).</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1989 <D>45,000 </D><D>Incl </D><D>Included because A was an employee described in paragraph (a)(1) (ii)or (iii) of this A-3 for the look-back year (1988).</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1990 <D>45,000 </D><D>Excl </D><D>Excluded because A was not an employee described in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) or (iii) of this A-3 for the look-back year (1989).</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (2).</T3> Assuming the same facts as those given in <T3>Example (1),</T3> except that A is a member of the top-100 employeeswithin the meaning of paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this A-3 for the 1987 yearand 1990 year, the results are as follows:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C/> <H1>Year </H1><H1>Compensation </H1><H1>Status </H1><H1>Comments</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">1986 <D>$45,000 </D><D>N/A </D><D>Although prior to 414(q) effective date, 1986 constitutes the look-backyear for purposes of determining the highly compensated group for the 1987determination year.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1987 <D>80,000 </D><D>Incl </D><D>Included because A was an employee described in paragraph (a)(1)(ii)or (iii) of this A-3 for the determination year (1987) and was describedin paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this A-3 in that year.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1988 <D>80,000 </D><D>Incl </D><D>Included because A was an employee described in paragraph (a)(1)(ii)or (iii) of this A-3 for the look-back year (1987).</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1989 <D>45,000 </D><D>Incl </D><D>Included because A was an employee described in paragraph (a)(1)(ii)or (iii) of this A-3 for the look-back year (1988).</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1990 <D>45,000 </D><D>Excl </D><D>Excluded even though in top-100 employees during 1990 determinationyear because A was not an employee described in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) or(iii) of this A-3 for the look-back year (1989) or for the determinationyear (1990).</D></ITAG></ITAG>A-4: Who is a highly compensated former employee?Q-4: (a) <T3>General rule. </T3>Except to the extent provided in paragraph (d) ofthis A-4, a highly compensated former employee for a determination yearis any former employee who, with respect to the employer, had a separationyear (as defined in A-5 of this andSection; 1.414(q)-1T) prior to the determinationyear and was a highly compensated active employee as defined in A-3 ofthis andSection; 1.414(q)-1T for either such employee's separation year orany determination year ending on or after the employee's 55th birthday.Thus, for example, an employee who is a highly compensated active employeefor such employee's separation year, by reason of receiving over $75,000during the look-back year, is a highly compensated former employee fordetermination years after such employee's separation year.(b) <T3>Special rule for employees who perform no services for the employerin the determination year.</T3> For purposes of this rule, employees whoperform no services for an employer during a determination year are treatedas former employees. Thus, for example, an employee who performed no servicesfor the employer during a determination year, by reason of a leave of absenceduring such year, is treated as a former employee for such year.(c) <T3>Dollar amounts for pre-1987 determination years. </T3>For determinationyears beginning before January 1, 1987, the dollar amounts in paragraph(a)(1)(B) and (C) of A-2 of this andSection; 1.414(q)-1T are $75,000 and$50,000 respectively.(d) <T3>Special rule for employees who separated from service before January1, 1987</T3>_(1) <T3>Election of special rule. </T3>Employers may elect to apply paragraph(d)(2) of this A-4 in lieu of paragraph (a) of this A-4 in determiningwhether former employees who separated from service prior to January 1,1987, are highly compensated former employees. If this election is madewith respect to any qualified plan, it must be provided for in the plan.If the employer makes this election with respect to any employee benefitplan, such election must be used uniformly for all purposes for which thesection 414(q) definition is applicable. The election, once made, cannotbe changed without the consent of the Commissioner.(2) <T3>Special definition of highly compensated former employee. </T3>A highlycompensated former employee includes any former employee who separatedfrom service with the employer prior to January 1, 1987, and was describedin any one or more of the following groups during either the employee'sseparation year (or the year preceding such separation year) or any yearending on or after such individual's 55th birthday (or the last year endingbefore such employee's 55th birthday):(i) <T3>5-percent owner. </T3>The employee was a 5-percent owner of the employerat any time during the year.(ii) <T3>Compensation amount. </T3>The employee received compensation is excessof $50,000 during the year.The determinations provided for in this paragraph (b)(2) may be made onthe basis of the calendar year, the plan year, or any other twelve monthperiod selected by the employer and applied on a reasonable and consistentbasis.(e) <T3>Rules with respect to former employees</T3>_(1) <T3>In general. </T3>For specific provisions with respect to the treatmentof former employees and of highly compensated former employees, refer tothe rules with respect to which the section 414(q) definition of highlycompensated employee is applicable.(2) <T3>Former employees excluded in determining top-paid group, top-100 employeesand includible officers. </T3>Former employees are not included in thetop-paid group, the group of the top-100 employees, or the group of includibleofficers for purposes of applying section 414(q) to active employees. Inaddition, former employees are not counted as employees for purposes ofdetermining the number of employees in the top-paid group.Q-5: What is a separation year for purposes of section 414(q)?A-5: (a) <T3>Separation year_</T3>(1) <T3>In general</T3>. The separation year generally is the determinationyear during which the employee separates from service with the employer.For purposes of this rule, an employee who performs no services for theemployer during a determination year will be treated as having separatedfrom service with the employer in the year in which such employee lastperformed services for the employer. Thus, for example, an employee whoperforms no services for the employer by reason of being on a leave ofabsence throughout the determination year is considered to have separatedfrom service with the employer in the year in which such employee lastperformed services prior to beginning the leave of absence. (2) <T3>Deemed separation. </T3>An employee who performs services for the employerduring a determination year may be deemed to have separated from servicewith the employer during such year pursuant to the rules in paragraph (a)(3)of this A-5. Such deemed separation year is relevant for purposes of determiningwhether such employee is a highly compensated former employee after suchemployee actually separates from service, not for purposes of identifyingsuch employee as either an active or former employee. Because employeesto whom the provisions of paragraph (a)(2) of this A-5 apply are stillperforming services for the employer during the determination year, theyare treated as active employees. Thus, for example, an employee who hasa deemed separation year in 1989, a year during which he was a highly compensatedemployee, who continues to work for the employer until he retires fromemployment in 1995, is an active employee of the employer until 1995 andis either highly compensated or not highly compensated for any determinationyear during such period based on the rules with respect to highly compensatedactive employees. For determination years after the year of such employee'sretirement, such employee is a highly compensated former employee becausesuch employee was a highly compensated active employee for the deemed separationyear. (3) <T3>Deemed separation year. </T3>An employee will be deemed to have a separationyear if, in a determination year prior to attainment of age 55, the employeereceives compensation in an amount less than 50% of the employee's averageannual compensation for the three consecutive calendar years precedingsuch determination year during which the employee received the greatestamount of compensation from the employer (or the total period of the employee'sservice with the employer, if less). (4) <T3>Leave of absence. </T3>The deemed separation rules contained in paragraph(a)(2) and (3) of this A-5 apply without regard to whether the reductionin compensation occurs on account of a leave of absence. (b) <T3>Deemed resumption of employment.</T3> An employee who is treated ashaving a deemed separation year by reason of the provisions of paragraph(a) of this A-5 will not be treated as a highly compensated former employee(by reason of such deemed separation year) after such employee actuallyseparates from service with the employer if, after such deemed separationyear, and before the year of actual separation, such employee's servicesfor and compensation from the employer for a determination year increasesignificantly so that such employee is treated as having a deemed resumptionof employment. The determination of whether an employee who has incurreda deemed separation year has an increase in services and compensation sufficientto result in a deemed resumption of employment will be made on the basisof all the surrounding facts and circumstances pertaining to each individualcase. At a minimum, there must be an increase in compensation from theemployer to the extent that such compensation would not result in a deemedseparation year under the tests in paragraph (a)(2) of this A-5 using thesame three-year period taken into account in such paragraph. (c) <T3>Examples.</T3> Paragraphs (a) and (b) of this A-5 are illustrated bythe following examples based on calendar years. For purposes of these examplesthe threshold dollar amounts in A-5(a) of this andSection; 1.414(q)-1T havenot been increased pursuant to A-5(b) of this andSection; 1.414(q)-1T.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (1).</T3> Assume that in 1990 A is a highly compensated employeeof X by reason of having earned more than $75,000 during the 1989 look-backyear. In 1987, 1988 and 1989, A's years of greatest compensation receivedfrom X, A received $76,000, $80,000 and $79,000 respectively. In Februaryof 1990, A received $30,000 in compensation. Because A's compensation duringthe 1990 determination year is less than 50% of A's average annual compensationfrom X during A's high three prior determination years, A is deemed tohave a separation year during the 1990 determination year pursuant to theprovisions of paragraph (a) of this A-5. Since A is a highly compensatedemployee for X in 1990, A's deemed separation year, A will be treated asa highly compensated former employee after A actually separates from servicewith the employer unless A experiences a deemed resumption of employmentwithin the meaning of paragraph (b) of this A-5. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (2). </T3> Assume that in 1990 A is a highly compensated employeeby reason of having been an officer (with annual compensation in excessof the section 415(c)(1)(A) dollar limitation) during the 1989 look-backyear. A's compensation from X during 1990 is $37,000. A's average compensationfrom X for the three-year period ending with or within January, 1990, was$60,000. A's compensation during the 1990 determination year is not lessthan 50% of the compensation earned during the test period. Therefore,A is not deemed to have a separation year under paragraph (a)(2)(i) ofthis A-5. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (3). </T3>Assume that in 1990 C is 35 and a highly compensatedemployee of Z for the reasons given in <T3>Example (1) </T3>with the same compensation set forth in that example.During 1990, C leaves C's 40 hour a week position as director of the actuarialdivision of Z and starts working as an actuary for the same division, producingactuarial reports approximately 15 to 20 hours a week, approximately halfof these hours at home. C contemplates returning to full-time employmentwith Z when C's child enters school. During the 1990 determination year,C's compensation is less than 50% of C's compensation during her high threepreceding determination years. Therefore, C has a deemed separation yearduring the 1990 determination year. In 1991 C commences working 32 hoursa week for X at X's place of business and receives compensation in an amountequal to 80 percent of her average annual compensation during her highthree prior determination years. The C's increased compensation, consideredin conjunction with the reasons for the reduction in service, the natureand extent of the services performed before and after the reduction inservices, and the lack of proximity of C's age to age 55 at the time ofthe reduction are sufficient to establish that C has a deemed resumptionof employment within the meaning of paragraph (b) of this A-5. Therefore,when C separates from service with the employer, C will not be treatedas a highly compensated former employee by reason of C's deemed separationyear in 1990.</ITAG>Q-6: Who is the employer?A-6: (a) <T3>Aggregation of certain entities. </T3>The employer is the entity employingthe employees and includes all other entities aggregated with such employingentity under the aggregation requirements of section 414(b), (c), (m) and(o). Thus, the following entities must be taken into account as a singleemployer for purposes of determining the employees who are ``highly compensatedemployees'' within the meaning of section 414(q):(1) All corporations that are members of a controlled group of corporations(as defined in section 414(b)) that includes the employing entity.(2) All trades or businesses (whether or not incorporated) that are undercommon control (as defined in section 414(c)) which group includes theemploying entity.(3) All organizations (whether or not incorporated) that are members ofan affiliated service group (as defined in section 414(m)) that includesthe employing entity.(4) Any other entities required to be aggregated with the employing entitypursuant to section 414(o) and the regulations thereunder.(b) <T3>Priority of aggregation provisions. </T3>The aggregation requirementsof paragraph (a) of this A-6 and of A-7(b) of this section with respectto leased employees are applied before the application of any of the otherprovisions of section 414(q) and this section.(c) <T3>Line of business rules. </T3>The section 414(r) rules with respectto separate lines of business are not applicable in determining the groupof highly compensated employees.Q-7: Who is an employee for purposes of section 414(q)?A-7: (a) <T3>General rule. </T3>Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this A-7,the term ``employee'' for purposes of section 414(q) refers to individualswho perform services for the employer and are either common-law employeesof the employer or self-employed individuals who are treated as employeespursuant to section 401(c)(1). This rule with respect to the inclusionof certain self-employed individuals in the group of highly compensatedemployees is applicable whether or not such individuals are eligible toparticipate in the plan or benefit arrangement being tested.(b) <T3>Leased employees</T3>_(1) <T3>In general. </T3>The term ``employee'' includes a leased employee whois treated as an employee of the recipient pursuant to the provisions ofsection 414(n)(2) or 414(o)(2). Employees that an employer treats as leasedemployees under section 414(n), pursuant to the requirements of section414(o), are considered to be leased employees for purposes of this rule.(2) <T3>Safe-harbor exception. </T3>For purposes of qualified retirement plans,if an employee who would be a leased employee within the meaning of section414(n)(2) is covered in a safe-harbor plan described in section 414(n)(5)(a qualified money purchase pension plan maintained by the leasing organization),and not otherwise covered under a qualified retirement plan of the employer,then such employee is excluded from the term ``employee'' unless the employerelects to include such employee pursuant to the provisions of paragraph(4) of this paragraph (b).(3) <T3>Other employee benefit plans. </T3>The exception in paragraph (b)(2)of this A-7 is not applicable to the determination of the highly compensatedemployee group for purposes of the sections enumerated in section 414(n)(3)(C).Thus, for example, a leased employee covered by a safe-harbor plan is consideredto be an employee in applying the nondiscrimination provisions of section89 to statutory benefit plans. Consequently, an employer with leased employeescovered in a safe-harbor plan may have 2 groups of highly compensated employees,one with respect to its retirement plans and another with respect to itsstatutory benefit plans.(4) <T3>Election with respect to leased employee exclusion. </T3>An employermay elect to include the employees excepted under the provisions of paragraph(b)(2) of this A-7 in determining the highly compensated group with respectto an employer's retirement plans. Thus, for example, by electing to foregothe exception in paragraph (b)(2) of this A-7, an employer may achievemore uniform highly compensated employee groups for purposes of its retirementplans and welfare benefit plans. The election to include such employeesmust be made on a reasonable and consistent basis and must be providedfor in the plan.Q-8: Who is a 5-percent owner of the employer? A-8: An employee is a 5-percent owner of the employer for a particularyear if, at any time during such year, such employee is a 5-percent owneras defined in section 416(i)(B)(i) and andSection; 1.416-1 A T-17andamp;18.Thus, if the employer is a corporation, a 5-percent owner is any employeewho owns (or is considered as owning within the meaning of section 318)more than 5 percent of the value of the outstanding stock of the corporationor stock possessing more than 5 percent of the total combined voting powerof all stock of the corporation. If the employer is not a corporation,a 5-percent owner is any employee who owns more than 5 percent of the capitalor profits interest in the employer. The rules of subsections (b), (c),and (m) of section 414 do not apply for purposes of determining who isa 5-percent owner. Thus, for example, an individual who is a 5-percentowner of a subsidiary corporation that is part of a controlled group ofcorporations within the meaning of section 414(b) is treated as a 5-percentowner for purposes of these rules.Q-9: How is the ``top-paid group'' determined? A-9: (a) <T3>General rule. </T3>An employee is in the top-paid group of employeesfor a particular year if such employee is in the group consisting of thetop 20 percent of the employer's employees when ranked on the basis ofcompensation received from the employer during such year. The identificationof the particular employees who are in the top-paid group for a year involvesa two-step procedure: (1) The determination of the number of employees that corresponds to 20percent of the employer's employees, and (2) The identification of the particular employees who are among the numberof employees who receive the most compensation during this year.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Employees who perform no services for the employer during a year arenot included in making either of these determinations for such year. (b) <T3>Number of employees in the top-paid group_</T3>(1) <T3>Exclusions. </T3>The number of employees who are in the top-paid groupfor a year is equal to 20 percent of the total number of active employeesof the employer for such year. However, solely for purposes of determiningthe total number of active employees in for a year, the employees excludedin paragraphs (i), (ii), and (iii) of this paragraph (b)(1) are disregarded.(i) <T3>Age and service exclusion. </T3>The following employees are excludedon the basis of age or service absent an election by the employer pursuantto the rules in paragraph (b)(2) of this A-9: (A) Employees who have not completed 6 months of service by the end ofsuch year. For purposes of this paragraph (A), an employee's service inthe immediately preceding year is added to service in the current yearin determining whether the exclusion is applicable with respect to a particularemployee in the current year. For example, given a plan with a calendardetermination year, if employee A commences work August 1, 1989, and terminatesemployment May 31, 1990, A may be excluded under this paragraph (b)(1)(i)(A)in 1989 because A completed only 5 months of service by December 31, 1989.However, A cannot be excluded pursuant to this rule in 1990 because A hascompleted 10 months of service, for purposes of this rule, by the end of1990.(B) Employees who normally work less than 17\1/2\ hours per week as definedin paragraph (d) of this A-9 for such year. (C) Employees who normally work during less than 6 months during any yearas defined in paragraph (e) of this A-9 for such year. (D) Employees who have not had their 21st birthdays by the end of suchyear. (ii) <T3>Nonresident alien exclusion. </T3>Employees who are nonresident aliensand who receive no earned income (within the meaning of section 911(d)(2))from the employer that constitutes income from sources within the UnitedStates (within the meaning of section 861(a)(3)) are excluded.(iii) <T3>Collective bargaining exclusion_</T3>(A) <T3>In general. </T3>Except as provided in paragraph (B) of this paragraph(b)(1)(iii), employees who are included in a unit of employees coveredby an agreement that the Secretary of Labor finds to be a collective bargainingagreement between employee representatives and the employer, which agreementsatisfies section 7701(a)(46) and andSection; 301.7701-17T (Temporary), areincluded in determining the number of employees in the top-paid group.(B) <T3>Percentage exclusion provision. </T3>If 90 percent or more of the employeesof the employer are covered under collective bargaining agreements thatthe Secretary of Labor finds to be collective bargaining agreements betweenemployee representatives and the employer, which agreements satisfy section7701(a)(46) and andSection; 301.7701-17T (Temporary), and the plan beingtested covers only employees who are not covered under such agreements,then the employees who are covered under such collective bargaining agreementsare not counted in determining the number of noncollective bargaining employeeswho will be included in the top-paid group for purposes of testing suchplan. In addition, such employees are not included in the top-paid groupfor such purposes. Thus, if the conditions of this paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(B)are satisfied, a separate calculation is required to determine the numberand identity of noncollective bargaining employees who will be highly compensatedemployees by reason of receiving over $50,000 and being in the top-paidgroup of employees for purposes of testing those plans that cover onlynoncollective bargaining employees.(2) <T3>Alternative exclusion provisions_</T3>(i) <T3>Age and service exclusion election. </T3>An employer may elect, ona consistent and uniform basis, to modify the permissible exclusions setforth in paragraph (b)(1)(i) (A), (B), (C), and (D) of this A-9 by substitutingany shorter period of service or lower age than that specified in suchparagraph. These exclusions may be modified to substitute a zero serviceor age requirement.(ii) <T3>Election not to apply percentage exclusion provision. </T3>An employermay elect not to exclude employees under the rules in paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(B)of this A-9.(iii) <T3>Method of election. </T3>The elections in this paragraph (b)(2) mustbe provided for in all plans of the employer and must be uniform and consistentwith respect to all situations in which the section 414(g) definition isapplicable to the employer. Thus, with respect to all plan years beginningin the same calendar year, the employer must apply the test uniformly forpurposes of determining its top-paid group with respect to all its qualifiedplans and employee benefit plans and for purposes of the line of businessrules set forth in section 414(r). If either election is changed duringthe determination year, no recalculation of the look-back year based onthe new election is required, provided the change in election does notresult in discrimination in operation.(c) <T3>Identification of top-paid group members. </T3>With the exception ofthe paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this A-9 exclusion for certain employees coveredby collective bargaining agreements, the exclusions in paragraph (b)(1)of this A-9 are not applicable for purposes of identifying the particularemployees in the top-paid group. Thus, for example, even if an employeewho normally works for less than 17\1/2\ hours is excluded in determiningthe number of employees in the top-paid group such employee may be a memberof the top-paid group. Similarly, if during a determination year, employeeA receives over $75,000 and is one of the top-100 employees ranked by compensation,then employee A is a highly compensated active employee for such determinationyear. This is true even though employee A has worked less than six monthsand thus may be excluded in determining the number of persons in the top-paidgroup for the determination year.(d) <T3>Example. </T3>Paragraphs (b) and (c) of this A-9 are illustrated bythe following example:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example. </T3>Employer X has 200 active employees during the 1989 determinationyear, 100 of whom normally work less than 17\1/2\ hours per week duringsuch year and 80 of whom normally work less than 15 hours per week duringsuch year. X elects to exclude all employees who normally work less than15 hours per week in determining the number of employees in the top-paidgroup. Thus, X excludes 80 employees in determining the number of employeesin the top-paid group. X's top-paid group for the 1989 determination yearconsists of 20% of 120 or 24 employees. All 200 of X's employees must thenbe ranked in order by compensation received during the year, and the 24employees X paid the greatest amount of compensation during the year aretop-paid employees with respect to X for the 1989 determination year.</ITAG>(e) <T3>17\1/2\ hour rule</T3>_(1) <T3>In general. </T3>The determination of whether an employee normallyworks less than 17\1/2\ hours per week is made independently for each yearbased on the rules in paragraph (e)(2) and (3) of this A-9. In making thisdetermination, weeks during which the employee did not work for the employerare not considered. Thus, for example, if an employee normally works twentyhours a week for twenty-five weeks during the fall and winter school quarters,10 hours a week for the 12 week spring quarter, and does not work for theemployer during the three-month summer quarter, such employee is treatedas normally working more than 17\1/2\ hours per week under the rule ofthis paragraph (e).(2) <T3>Deemed above 17\1/2\. </T3>An employee who works 17\1/2\ hours a weekor more, for more than fifty percent of the total weeks worked by suchemployee during the year, is deemed to normally work more than 17\1/2\hours a week for purposes of this rule.(3) <T3>Deemed below 17\1/2\. </T3>An employee who works less than 17\1/2\hours a week for fifty percent or more of the total weeks worked by suchemployee during the year is deemed to normally work less than 17\1/2\ hoursa week for purposes of this rule.(4) <T3>Application. </T3>The determination provided for in paragraph (e)(1),(2), and (3) of this A-9 may be made separately with respect to each employee,or on the basis of groups of employees who fall within particular job categoriesas established by the employer on a reasonable basis. For example, underthe rule of this paragraph (e)(4) an employer may exclude all office cleaningpersonnel if, for the year in question, the employees performing this functionnormally work less than 17\1/2\ hours a week. This is true even thoughone or more employees within this group normally work in excess of 17\1/2\hours. The election to make this determination on the basis of individualsor groups is operational and does not require a plan provision.(5) <T3>Application based on groups. </T3>(i) Groups of employees who performthe same job are not required to be considered as one category for purposesof the rule in paragraph (e)(4) of this A-9. Thus, for example, an employersupermarket may determine its highly compensated employees by excludingpart-time grocery checkers if such personnel normally work less than 17\1/2\hours a week while continuing to include full-time personnel performingthis function. In general, 80 percent of the positions within a particularjob category must be filled by employees who normally work less than 17\1/2\hours a week before any employees may be excluded under this rule on thebasis of their membership in that job category.(ii) Alternatively, an employer may exclude employees who are members ofa particular job category if the median number of hours of service creditedto employees in that category during a determination or look-back yearis 500 or less.(f) <T3>6-month rule</T3>_(1) <T3>In general. </T3>The determination of whether employees normally workduring not more than 6 months in any year is made on the basis of the factsand circumstances of the particular employer as evidenced by the employer'scustomary experience in the years preceding the determination year. Anemployee who works on one day during a month is deemed to have worked duringthat month.(2) <T3>Application of prior year experience. </T3>In making the determinationunder this paragraph (f), the experience for years immediately precedingthe determination year will generally be weighed more heavily than thatof earlier years. However, this emphasis on more recent years is not appropriateif the data for a particular year reflects unusual circumstances. For example,if fishermen working for employer X worked 9 months in 1987 and 1988, 8months in 1989, and then, because of abnormal ice conditions, worked only5 months in 1990, such fishermen could not be excluded under this rulein 1990. Furthermore, the data with respect to 1990 would not be weighedmore heavily in making a determination with respect to subsequent years.(3) <T3>Individual or group basis. </T3>This determination may be made separatelywith respect to each employee or on the basis of groups of employees whofall within particular job categories in the manner set forth in paragraph(e)(4) of this A-8.Q-10. For purposes of determining the group of highly compensated employees,which employees are officers and which officers must be included in thehighly compensated group?A-10: (a) <T3>In general.</T3> Subject to the limitations set forth in paragraph(b) of this A-10 and the top-100 employee rule set forth in A-2, an employeeis an includible officer for purposes of this section and is a member ofthe group of highly compensated employees if such employee is an officerof the employer (within the meaning of section 416(i) and andSection; 1.416-1A-T 13 andamp; A-T 15) at any time during the determination year or look-backyear and receives compensation during such year that is greater than 150percent of the dollar limitation in effect under section 415(c)(1)(A) forthe calendar year in which the determination or look-back year begins.In addition, an officer who does not meet the 415(c)(1)(A) dollar limitationrequirement may be an includible officer based on the minimum inclusionrules set forth in paragraph (c) of this A-10. (b) <T3>Maximum limitation_</T3>(1) <T3>In general. </T3>Nor more than 50 employees (or, if lesser, the greaterof 3 employees or 10 percent of the employees without regard to any exclusions)shall be treated as officers for purposes of this provision in determiningthe group of highly compensated employees for any determination year orlook-back year. (2) <T3>Total number of employees. </T3>The total number of employees for purposesof the limitation in this paragraph (b) is the number of employees theemployer has during the particular determination year or look-back year.For purposes of this A-10, employees include only those individuals whoperform services for the employer during the determination or look-backyear. The exclusions applicable for purposes of determining the numberof employees in the top-paid group are not applicable for purposes of thelimitations in this paragraph (b).(3) <T3>Inclusion ranking. </T3>If the number of the employer's officers whosatisfy paragraph (a) of this A-10 during either the determination yearor the look-back year exceeds the limitation under this paragraph (b),then the officers who will be considered as includible officers for purposesof this rule are those who receive the greatest compensation from the employerduring such determination or look-back year. The definition of compensationin A-13 is to be used for this purpose. (c) <T3>Minimum inclusion rule. </T3>This paragraph (c) is applicable whenno officer of the employer satisfies the compensation requirements of paragraph(a) of this A-10 during either a determination year or look-back year.In such case, the highest paid officer of the employer for such year istreated as a highly compensated employee by reason of being an officer,without regard to the amount of compensation paid to such officer in relationto the section 415(c)(1)(A) dollar amount for the year. This is true whetheror not such employee is also a highly compensated employee on any otherbasis. Thus, for example, if no officer of employer X meets the compensationrequirements of paragraph (a) of this A-10 during the 1989 look-back year,and employee A is both the highest paid officer during such year and a5-percent owner, employee A is treated as an includible officer satisfyingthe minimum inclusion rules of this paragraph. (d) <T3>Separate application. </T3>The maximum and minimum officer inclusionrules of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this A-10 apply separately with respectto the determination year calculation and the look-back year calculation.Thus, for example, if no officer of employer X receives compensation abovethe threshold amount in paragraph (a) of this A-10 during either the determinationyear or look-back year, application of the minimum inclusion rule wouldresult in the officer of employer X who received the greatest compensationduring the look-back year being treated as a highly compensated employeeand, in addition, the officer of employer X who receives the most compensationduring the determination year would be included in the highly compensatedgroup if such officer is also in the top-100 employees of employer X forsuch year. Thus, two officers may be treated as highly compensated activeemployees for a determination year by reason of the provisions of the minimuminclusion rule. Q-11: To what extent must family members who are employed by the same employerbe aggregated for purposes of section 414(q)?A-11: (a) <T3>Family aggregation</T3>_(1)<T3> In general.</T3> Aggregation is required with respect to an employeewho is, during a particular determination year or look-back year, a familymember (as defined in A-12) of either (i) a 5-percent owner who is an activeor former employee or (ii) a highly compensated employee who is one ofthe ten most highly compensated employees ranked on the basis of compensationpaid by the employer during such year.(2) <T3>Aggregation of contributions or benefits.</T3> As prescribed in regulationsunder the provisions to which section 414(q) is applicable, a family memberand a 5-percent owner or top-10 highly compensated employee aggregatedunder this rule are generally treated as a single employee receiving anamount of compensation and a plan contribution or benefit that is basedon the compensation, contributions, and benefits of such family memberand 5-percent owner or top-10 highly compensated employee. (b) <T3>Exclusion status irrelevant.</T3> Family members are subject to thisaggregation rule whether or not they fall within the categories of employeesthat may be excluded for purposes of determining the number of employeesin the top-paid group and whether or not they are highly compensated employeeswhen considered separately.(c) <T3>Order of determination</T3>_(1) <T3>Determination of highly compensated employees.</T3> The determinationof which employees are highly compensated employees and which highly compensatedemployees are among the ten most highly compensated employees in makingthe look-back year calculation or the determination year calculation fora determination year will be made prior to the application of the rulesin paragraph (a) of this A-11.(2) <T3>Determination of top-paid group and top-100 employees.</T3> The determinationof the number and identity of employees in the top-paid group under thelook-back year calculation or the determination year calculation for adetermination year and the identity of individuals in the top-100 employeesunder the determination year calculation for a determination year is madeprior to application of the rules in paragraph (a) of this A-11. (d) <T3>Determination period.</T3> The rules under paragraph (a) of this A-11apply separately to the determination year and the look-back year. Thus,assuming there are no 5-percent owners, if employees A, B, C, D, E, F,G, H, I and J are the top 10 highly compensated employees in the 1988 look-backyear, and employees F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N and O are the top 10 highlycompensated employees in the 1989 determination year, then family aggregationwould be required with respect to all fifteen of such employees (i.e. employeesA, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, and O).Q-12: Which individuals are family members for purposes of the aggregationrules in section 414(a)(6)(A) and A-11?A-12: (a) <T3>Definition of family member.</T3> Individuals who are family membersfor purposes of these provisions include, with respect to any employeeor former employee, such employee's or former employee's spouse and linealascendants or descendants and the spouses of such lineal ascendants anddescendants. In determining whether an individual is a family member withrespect to an employee or former employee, legal adoptions shall be takeninto account. (b) <T3>Test period.</T3> If an individual is a family member with respectto an employee or former employee on any day during the year, such individualis treated as a family member for the entire year. Thus, for example, ifan individual is a family member with respect to an employee on the firstday of a year, such individual continues to be a family member with respectto such employee throughout the year even though their relationship changesas a result of death or divorce. Q-13: How is ``compensation'' determined for purposes of determining thegroup of ``highly compensated employees.''A-13: (a) <T3>In general.</T3> For purposes of section 414(q), the term ``compensation''means compensation within the meaning of section 415(c)(3) without regardto sections 125, 402(a)(8), and 402(h)(1)(B) and, in the case of employercontributions made pursuant to a salary reduction agreement, without regardto section 403(b). Thus, compensation includes elective or salary reductioncontributions to a cafeteria plan, cash or deferred arrangement or tax-shelteredannuity. (b) <T3>Determination period.</T3> For purposes of determining the group ofhighly compensated employees, compensation must be calculated on the basisof the applicable period for the determination year and look-back yearrespectively.(c) <T3>Compensation taken into account.</T3> Only compensation received byan employee during the determination year or during the look-back yearis considered in determining whether such employee is a highly compensatedactive employee under either the look-back year calculation or determinationyear calculation for such determination year. Thus, compensation is notannualized for purposes of determining an employee' compensation in thedetermination year or the look-back year in applying the rules of paragraph(a) of this A-13.Q-14: What periods must be used for determining who is a highly compensatedemployee for a determination year?A-14: (a) <T3>Determination year and look-back year</T3>_(1) <T3>In general. </T3>For purposes of determining the group of highly compensatedemployees for a determination year, the determination year calculationis made on the basis of the applicable year of the plan or other entityfor which a determination is being made and the look-back year calculationis made on the basis of the twelve month period immediately preceding suchyear. Thus, in testing plans X and Y of an employer, if plan X has a calendaryear plan year and plan Y has a July 1 to June 30 plan year, the determinationyear calculation and look-back year calculation for plan X must be madeon the basis of the calendar year. Similarly, the determination year calculationand look-back year calculation for plan Y must be made on the basis ofthe July 1 to June 30 year.(2) <T3>Applicable year. </T3>For purposes of this A-14, the applicable yearis the plan year of the qualified plan or other employee benefit arrangementto which the definition of highly compensated employees is applicable asdefined in the written plan document or otherwise identified in regulationspursuant to sections to which the definition of highly compensated employeesis applicable. To the extent that the definition of highly compensatedemployees is applicable to entities of other arrangements that do not havean otherwise identified plan year, then either the calendar year of theemployer's fiscal year may be treated as the plan year.(3) <T3>Look-back year. </T3>The look-back year is never less than a twelvemonth period.(b) <T3>Calendar year calculation election_</T3>(1) <T3>In general. </T3>An employer may elect to make the look-back year calculationfor a determination year on the basis of the calendar year ending withor within the applicable determination year (or, in the case of a determinationyear that is shorter than twelve months, the calendar year ending withor within the twelve-month period ending with the end of the applicabledetermination year). In such case, the employer must make the determinationyear calculation for the determination year on the basis of the period(if any) by which the applicable determination year extends beyond suchcalendar year (i.e., the lag period). If the applicable year for whichthe determination is being made is the calendar year, the employer stillmay elect to make the calendar year calculation election under this A-14(b).In such case, the look-back year calculation is made on the basis of thecalendar year determination year and, because there is no lag period, aseparate determination year calculation under A-3(a)(2) of this andSection;1.414(q)-1 is not required.(2) <T3>Lag period calculation. </T3>In making the determination year calculationunder A-3(a)(2) of this andSection; 1.414(q)-1 on the basis of the lag period,the dollar amounts applicable under A-3(a)(1) (B) and (C) of this andSection;1.414(q)-1 are to be adjusted by multiplying such dollar amounts by a fraction,the numerator of which is the number of calendar months that are includedin the lag period and the denominator of which is twelve.(3) <T3>Determination of active employees. </T3>An employee will be consideredan active employee for purposes of a determination year for which the calendaryear calculation election is in effect so long as such employee performsservices for the employer during the applicable year for which the determinationis being made. This is the case even if such employee does not performservices for the employer during the lag-period for such determinationyear.(4) <T3>Election requirement. </T3>If the employer elects to make the calendaryear calculation election with respect to one plan, entity, or arrangement,such election must apply with respect to all plans, entities, and arrangementsof the employer. In addition, such election must be provided for in theplan.(c) <T3>Change in applicable years. </T3>Where there is a change in the applicableyear for which a determination is being made with respect to a plan entity,or other arrangement that is not subject to the calendar year calculationelection, the look-back year calculation for the short applicable yearis to be made on the basis of the twelve month period preceding the shortapplicable year (i.e., generally, the old applicable year) and the determinationyear calculation for the short applicable year is to be made on the basisof the short applicable year. In addition, the dollar amounts under A-3(a)(1)(B) and (C) are to be adjusted for such determination year calculationas if the short applicable year were a lag period under paragraph (b)(2)of this A-14.(d) <T3>Example. </T3>The following examples illustrates the rules of thisA-14:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 1.</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Employer X has a single plan (Plan A) with an April 1 to March 31plan year. Employer X makes no election to use the calendar year for thedetermination period. Therefore, in determining the group of highly compensatedemployees for the April 1, 1989 to March 31, 1990 plan year, the determinationyear is the plan year ending March 31, 1990 and the look-back year is theplan year ending March 31, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 2.</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Assume the same facts given above. With respect to the plan year beginningin 1990, employer X elects to use the calendar year for the determinationperiod. Therefore, in determining the group of highly compensated employeesfor the April 1, 1990 to March 31, 1991 plan year, the lag-period determinationyear is the period from January 1, 1991, through March 31, 1991, and theapplicable look-back year is the 1990 calendar year.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 3.</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Employer Y has a single plan (Plan B) with a calendar plan year. Withrespect to the plan year beginning in 1990, employer Y elects to make thelook-back year calculation for the 1990 determination year on the basisof the calendar year ending with or within the 1990 determination year.Because employer Y's determination year is the 1990 calendar year thereis no lag period and employer Y determines the group of highly compensatedemployees for purposes of the 1990 calendar plan year on the basis of suchplan year alone.</ITAG>Q-15: Is there any transition rule in determining the group of highly compensatedemployees for 1987 and 1988?A-15: (a) <T3>In general. </T3>Solely for purposes of section 401(k)(3) and (m)(2)and solely for twelve-month plan years beginning in 1987 and 1988, an eligibleemployer may elect to define the group of highly compensated employeesas the group consisting of 5-percent owners of the employer at any timeduring the plan year and employees who receive compensation in excess of$50,000 during the plan year. This rule would apply in lieu of the look-backyear calculation and determination year calculation otherwise applicableunder A-3(a) of this andSection; 1.44(q)-1. In addition, an eligible employermay elect to make the determinations permitted under this transition ruleon the basis of the calendar year ending in the plan year and the periodby which such plan year extends beyond such calendar year, in accordancewith the rules of A-14(b), in lieu of making the determinations under thistransition rule on the basis of the plan year for which the determinationsare being made. (b) <T3>Eligible employers. </T3>An employer is an eligible employer underthis A-15 if such employer satisfies both of the following requirements:(1) The employer does not maintain any top-heavy plan within the meaningof section 416 at any time during 1987 and 1988; and(2) Under each plan of the employer to which section 401(k)(3) or 401(m)(2)is applicable, the group of eligible employees that comprises the highest25% of eligible employees ranked on the basis of compensation includesat least one employee whose compensation is $50,000 or below. This requirementmust be met separately with respect to each such plan of the employer.(c) <T3>Uniformity requirement.</T3> An eligible employer may not make theelection under paragraph (a) of this A-15 unless the election applies toall of the plans maintained by the employer to which section 401(k)(3)or 401(m)(2) applies.(d) <T3>Election requirements.</T3> This election is operational and does notrequire a plan provision.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1.414(s)-1T</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Compensation.</ITAG>The following questions and answers relate to the definition of compensationprovided in section 414(s).

Thus, the regulations applicableto a particular rule that utilizes the section 414(s) definition of compensationwill specify the applicable period under section 414(s) for purposes ofsuch rule.(c) <T3>Applicability.</T3> The definition in paragraph (a) of this A-1 isgenerally applicable for purposes of applying the nondiscrimination rulesof sections 401 through 419A (including the actual deferral percentagetest for a cash or deferred arrangement and the actual contribution percentagetest for employee and employer matching contributions contained in section401(k)(3) and 401(m)(3) respectively). However, the definition of compensationin paragraph (a) of this A-1 does not apply to sections that specificallydefine compensation in a different manner. Examples of provisions for whichthe section 414(s) definition of compensation is not applicable include,but are not limited to, the definition of highly compensated employeescontained in section 414(q), the limitations on benefits and contributionsset forth in section 415, and the deduction provisions of section 404(a)and (b).Q-2: How is compensation determined for self-employed individuals withinthe meaning of section 401(c)(1)?A-2: The basis definition of compensation, for purposes of self-employedindividuals, is earned income (as defined in section 401(c)(1)) for theapplicable period (as defined in A-1(c) of this andSection; 1.414(s)-1) derivedfrom such individual's trade or business.Q-3: May an employer elect to treat certain deferrals as compensation?A-3: Yes. An employer may elect to include in the basic definition of compensationall elective contributions made by the employer on behalf of its employeesthat are not includible in the gross income of an employee under sections125, 402(a)(8), 402(h), or 403(b). This election must be made on a consistentand uniform basis with respect to all employees and all plans of the employerfor any particular year, must be made on a reasonable and consistent basisfrom year to year, and must be provided for in the plan. The employer maychange this election provided such change does not result in discriminationin favor of highly compensated employees.Q-4: What, if any, alternative definitions of compensation may be usedby an employer?A-4: (a) <T3>Alternative basic definitions. </T3>For applicable periods beginningin 1987 and 1988, an employer may elect to use the following alternativedefinitions of compensation in lieu of the basic definition set forth A-1of this section. Any such election must be provided for in the plan andmade on a reasonable and consistent basis from year to year. An employermay change an election made under this A-4(a) provided such change doesnot result in discrimination in favor of highly compensated employees.(1) <T3>W-2 compensation. </T3>Compensation received during the applicableperiod (as defined in A-1(c) of this andSection; 1.414(s)-1) by the employeefrom the employer that is required to be reported as wages on the employee'sForm W-2 for income tax purposes. This election may include or excludeall amounts that are not currently includible in the employee's gross incomeby reason of the application of sections 125, 402(a)(8), 402(h)(1)(B) or402(b), provided such total inclusion or exclusion is made on a consistentand uniform basis with respect to all plans of the employer for any particularyear, made on a reasonable and consistent basis from year to year, andprovided for in the plan.

Any such alternativedefinition is permissible under section 414(s) only if it is describedin A-4(b)(2) and satisfies the nondiscrimination rule set forth in A-4(b)(3).(2) <T3>Available alternative definitions of compensation_</T3>(i) <T3>Regular or base salary or wages. </T3>Regular or base salary or wages(excluding overtime and bonuses) received during the applicable period(defined in A-1(c) of this andSection; 1.414(s)-1) by the employee from theemployer.(ii) <T3>Regular or base salary or wages plus overtime and/or bonuses.</T3>Regular or base salary or wages, plus either or both overtime and/or bonuses,received during the applicable period (defined in A-1(c) of this andSection;1.414(s)-1) by the employee from the employer.(iii) <T3>Commissioner may make additional definitions available. </T3>The Commissionermay, consistent with the provisions of this section, make additional definitionsof compensation available under this A-4(b). Any such additional definitionis permissible under section 414(s) only if such definition satisfies thenondiscrimination rule set forth in A-4(b)(3).(3) <T3>Nondiscrimination rule. </T3>An alternative definition of compensationdescribed in A-4(b)(2) satisfies this rule only if the compensation percentagefor the employer's highly compensated employees is not greater than thecompensation percentage for the employer's other employees. The compensationpercentage for a group of employees is calculated by averaging the separatelycalculated compensation ratios for each employee in the group. An employee'scompensation ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of the employee'scompensation that is included in the alternative definition by the amountof such employee's compensation that is included in the basic definitionof compensation (set forth in A-1 of this andSection; 1.414(s)-1 or (a) ofthis A-4) for the applicable period (defined in A-1(c) of this section).There is a need for immediate guidance with respect to the provisions containedin this Treasury decision.
