In the case of weak magneticdisturbance, first of all, N magnetic diurnal variation curves with magneticdisturbance are smoothed to get the quiet-day magnetic diurnal variationcurves. Then magnetic disturbance curves can be obtained by taking thedifferences between the magnetic diurnal variation curves with magneticdisturbance and their corresponding quiet-day magnetic diurnal variationcurves. Finally, the averaged power spectrum of quiet-day magnetic diurnalvariation curves and the average spectrum of magnetic disturbance curvesare respectively obtained, which are thus used to design Wiener filteringoperator. When magnetic disturbance and magnetic storm are quite strong,spline function method may be used to remove magnetic disturbance andmagnetic storm. In this method, characteristic points are taken as controlsample points; or according to observational curve, zero and extremevalue points can be empirically used as sample points. The theoreticalmodels show that these methods are superior to the currently used localtime method, hour average method and Beijing time method. These methodsbring quite good results in real data processing.</TEXT></DOC>
