OS/2 breaks out the driver components into separate loadable drivers that can be either enabled or disabled by editing the CONFIG.SYS or STARTUP.CMD fileswith  any ASCII word processor.andP;  The only other problem our users have facedis that although the Novell and  3Com file servers share the same Ethernetcabling, they cannot talk to each  other.andP;  A PC workstation can see one netor the other (which one is determined  by the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BATfiles) but not both.andP;  We need the 3Com system  for electronic mail to ourCalifornia office, but we use the Novell system for  all editing andtypesetting in our   Media office.andP;  Fortunately, our Macintoshes can see bothnets at the same time.andP;  We regularly  use the Macs to move files from onesystem to the other.andP;  @@@075311429 0SRDHHo012PIFTandM;Timeworks is known as a leader in the &quot;low-end&quot;  desktop publishing softwareandM;market.andP;  Its inexpensive Publish-It programs, which run on the Apple 11,MSDOSandM;and Atari computer lines, have been bought by relatively inexperienced usersandM;who wanted a quick and easy way to put out club newsletters, churchbulletins,andM;internal memos, and other publications that didn't need the mostsophisticatedandM;tools.andM;Having succeeded in that market, Timeworks decided to raise its sights andandM;to produce a program that would please the power users.andP;  This transition is aandM;demanding one, and the path upward was littered with the remains of programsandM;that couldn't thrive in the more rarefied atmosphere.andP;  But when we first sawandM;Publish-It for the Macintosh at this spring's Comdex show, we were impressedandM;by Timeworks' ambition and seriousness of purpose.andP;  We were anxious to seethisandM;program in its finished form.andM;Publish-It for the Mac, version 1.1 was released last month (1.0 was aandM;beta version).andP;  This review aims to show how well it has succeeded in itsloftyandM;mission.andM;Challenging the champ.andP;  The desktop publishing revolution, as we know it, wasandM;launched in 1985 with the near simultaneous introductions of the AppleandM;LaserWriter and Aldus's PageMaker.andP;  Virtually overnight, computer dealersfoundandM;their customers buying Macs and LaserWriters purely to run PageMaker-just asandM;the number-crunchers had queued up to buy PCs to run Lotus 1-2-3 severalyearsandM;earlier.andM;So why do PageMaker and Ventura Publisher-both early starters-continue toandM;reign as undisputed kings of desktop publishing on their respective platformsandM;(Macs and PCs), accounting for nearly 80% of the market share between them?andM;They have both brushed aside challenges from below (MacPublisher and PFSFirstandM;Publisher, and their ilk) and from above (Interleaf Publisher, among others).andM;And even those survivors inhabiting the second tier-Qark's Xpress andandM;Letraset's ReadySetGo 4.5, fine products with features equal to, and in manyandM;cases surpassing, those of PageMaker-have found it necessary to target nicheandM;markets (quality composition and color, in Quark's case, and the graphicandM;artist/designer community, in Letraset's) to survive.andM;Prescription for success.andP;  What would it take to knock PageMaker off itsthroneandM;in the Mac market? We have long argued that garnering a high score on theandM;features checklist isn't sufficient in its own right to displace a marketandM;leader with such commanding market share.andP;  PageMaker has survived competitiveandM;challenges because of:andM;* The Big Mo': When a product is as dominant as PageMaker, it becomes thesafe choice for the faint of heart.andP;  If  everyone else is buying it, it mustbe good.andP;  And even if I can't figure it out  myself, there are books, usergroups and consultants galore that can help me do  so.andM;* It's good enough: Whenever one of its competitors has come out with a set of  killer&quot; features, PageMaker has quickly followed with a new release that brought it within spitting distance of parity.andP;  Features won't win anyconverts  unless they are overwhelmingly better than what the market leaderoffers.andP;  IBM  has counted on this phenomenon for years-and consistently wonsales because of  it.andM;*  Inertia: A lot of people out there cut their teeth on PageMaker.andP;  They have many man-years of work tied up in PageMaker templates, files, and just plain savvy.andP;  As Stewart Alsop (a devoted PageMaker user in his own right)once  observed, he won't even consider adopting a new desktop publishingpackage  unless at minimum it has the ability to read in all of his PageMakerfiles and  templates.andM;Now yet another brash challenger has come along to dispute PageMaker's hegemony: Publish-It for the Mac.andP;  Does it measure up? And more to the point,does it have a prayer of a chance of giving PageMaker a run for its money?andO;The market as a trinity.andP;  Timeworks views the high-end Mac composition marketas  divided into three areas.andP;  InandM;professional publishing,&quot; used for ads, brochures, package layouts and other jobs requiring sophisticated design, Quark Xpress holds sway.andP;  In &quot;productionpublishing,&quot; used to prepare long, intricate documents, Interleaf Publisheris  on top.andP;  And in &quot;personal publishing,&quot; the creation (usually by a singleworker) of newsletters and other short documents, PageMaker rules.andP;  Showingan admirable lack of fear, Timeworks has chosen theandM;last of these categories as the playing field for its new program.andM;Taking a share of the leader's market is tough.andP;  To gain a foothold,andM;Timeworks must give future publishers compelling reasons to pick Publish-ItandM;instead of PageMaker.andP;  And for Publish-It to truly thrive, some currentandM;PageMaker users must be convinced that the switch-which entails spending moreandM;money, retraining operators, and losing existing documents and templates-isandM;worthwhile.andM;In short, for Publish-It to gain a large market share it must offer moreandM;functionality than PageMaker, be easier to learn and use, be at least asandM;reliable, and cost less-a tall order for any would-be contender.andM;It has satisfied the last of these conditions, coming in at a list priceandM;of $395 compared to PageMaker's $595.andP;  The other three conditions, though,areandM;the key ones.andP;  Let's see how Timeworks approached them.andM;Quantity vs.andP;  quality.andP;  When we saw a demo of Publish-It for the Mac(henceforthandM;PIM) at Comdex this spring, we were impressed by its large collection ofandM;features.andP;  In addition to the page layout and typographic tools that onewouldandM;expect, it offers sophisticated word processing and a surprisingly completeandM;array of graphics tools, both raster and vector.andP;  A palette of 36 tools attheandM;left edge of the screen illustrates the richness of its features.andM;As vendors and customers have learned over the years, though, theandM;quantity of features in a program means little compared to their quality.andP;  WeandM;will rate PIM's features for both quantity and quality.andM;What is it? Like PageMaker, PIM is most adept at producing short,andM;layout-driven documents.andP;  It is very strong in creating graphics, and it hasandM;nice word processing features.andP;  However, it lacks longer-document featuressuchandM;as footnotes, tables of contents and indices.andP;  No one will want to use PIMforandM;thick technical manuals.andM;To its credit, PIM takes advantage of the Macintosh's windowingandM;abilities.andP;  It allows the user to have multiple documents open, with as manyasandM;four displayed and editable at one time.andP;  Elements can be moved or copiedfromandM;one document to another.andP;  These abilities broaden PIM's possibleapplications.andM;Timeworks' audience is not concerned with issues such as colorandM;separations and interfacing to high-end color prepress systems.andP;  PIM isandM;designed for the user with relatively simple typographic needs who wantsandM;powerful word processing and graphics features but doesn't want to create aandM;text file in one program and graphics in others, then have to merge them intoandM;yet another.andP;  User interface  Menus and dialog boxes.andP;  Anyone familiar withthe Macintosh  should be at home with PIM's cascading pulldown  menus.andP;  Thereare far more of them than in PageMaker, but  they operate the same way:highlighting a menu selection  marked with an arrowhead brings up an adjacentmenu  containing choices from within the marked categoryandM;The dialog boxes are also typical of the Mac; unlike  PageMaker, PIM neverpresents a second dialog box as a submenu of a first one.andP;  Quick keys.andP;  Youcan specify many options and call up many dialog boxes by  pressing thecommand key along with another key The letter-based quick keys are  asmnemonic as they could be, given the constraints of our alphabet, but the numeric ones take some getting used to-&quot;command-6,&quot; for instance, does not intuitively suggest  view pages at half actual size.&quot;andP;  Palettes.andP;  Fourseparate palettes, containing a total of 36 icons, float at the  left edge ofthe screen; they can be moved to the right edge.andP;  They are:  * Main toolpalette-tools for defining and resizing elements,andM;creating text and graphics frames, entering text, creatingandM;paragraph styles, linking text frames, cropping rasterandM;graphics, turning objects into bitmaps and converting textandM;frames or vector graphics into part of a raster graphicandM;frame.andP;  *  Current settings palette-popup menus for selecting a penandM;width, a shading pattern for raster graphics, a fill patternandM;for vector graphics, arrowheads for line endings, the colorandM;of a layer, and the way two frames should overlap.andP;  *  Draw toolpalette-tools for creating ovals and circles,  rectanglesandM;and squares, lines, ares, diamond shapes,andM;horizontal and vertical lines, Bezier curves, polygons,andM;freehand shapes, objects comprising radial spokes emanatingandM;from a common point, grids of rectangles, andandM;rectangles with rounded corners.andM;* Paint tool palette-tools for moving a raster graphic withinandM;its frame and defining a portion of the graphic, along withandM;the typical paint can, spray can, pencil, eraser, andandM;paintbrushandM;(of user-specifiable width).andM;The left-edge display also includes a status display,andM;which at various times shows information ranging from the x/y coordinates ofandM;the current cursor position to the name of the paragraph tag in use to theandM;time of day and the amount of free memory left in the Mac.andP;  Below that areaisandM;an icon showing the current page number, along with arrows that move youandM;forward or backward a page at a time; this isn't as convenient as PageMaker'sandM;multipage icon, but PIM does let you go right to a page by using commandandM;keys.andM;Measurements.andP;  You can specify whether the rulers and object specificationsandM;should be defined in inches, centimeters, picas or screen pixels.andO;(HorizontalandM;and vertical measurement systems cannot be specified separately.) Even afterandM;specifying the measuring system, though, you must still follow each numberandM;that you enter into a dialog box with a letter to indicate the measuringandM;system you are using; if you are using picas and merely enter a number for,andM;say, a defined object's height, the program assumes that you mean inches.andM;You can enter a measurement in picas and points, but the program thenandM;displays that measurement in picas and tenths of a pica.andP;  Our text columns,andM;which were defined as 50 picas and 5 points, were changed in the objectandM;specifications menu to 50.4 picas.andP;  Also, any measurements entered inandM;different units from the ones currently in effect are converted to theandM;prevailing system.andM;Timeworks assures us that the program follows the specified measurement,andM;not the one to which the original is converted.andP;  Still, we would rather seeandM;the measurement we specified; showing the real dimensions is more importantandM;than using a consistent display.andP;  Besides, nobody we know measures in tenthsandM;of a pica.andM;Thumbnails and other views.andP;  There are ten predefined view sizes, rangingfromandM;12% to 800% of actual size.andP;  Command keys instantly change the display tohalfandM;or twice its current scale.andM;One of the most useful scales is the editable thumbnail view, whichandM;displays all the pages of a document on the screen at once.andP;  You specify howandM;many thumbnails should be in each row; this number defines their size.andP;  InandM;this mode, which gives you a good overview of the document, all PIM functionsandM;work; you can change text, draw graphics, and so forth.andM;When multiple documents are open, you can have two displayed side-by-sideandM;or top-and-bottom, or you can choose smaller displays of up to four.andP;  In anyandM;of these cases, all displayed documents are editable.andM;Help.andP;  An intricate help system is always available.andP;  It is notcontext-sensitive; the same menu is produced wheneverandM;Layout Like many other publishing programs, Publish-It for the Mac is basedonandM;the concept of frames.andP;  Before entering text or using the raster graphictools,andM;you must create the proper type of frame.andM;Setup.andP;  In the document setup process, you define the document's length (100andM;pages is the limit), whether or not to use master pages (see below), whetherandM;to start with a title page that is not affected by master pages, and how manyandM;pages wide the thumbnail view should be.andM;To set up each page, you use the &quot;place columns&quot; dialog box.andP;  Here, youandM;specify how many text columns are on each page and set their placementandM;attributes.andM;Frames.andP;  There are two types of frames: those for text and those for rasterandM;graphics.andP;  You cannot put text into a raster graphic frame or vice versa.andM;However, vector graphics can go anywhere, whether either or neither kind ofandM;frame is present.andM;The &quot;specifications&quot; dialog box lets you define a frame's dimensionsandM;precisely (within the program's measurement limits).andP;  However, you cannotcreate a frame (or a vector  graphic element such as a rule) merely byspecifying these dimensions.andP;  You must  first create it using a tool, thenmodify its dimensions.andP;  If you know what  specifications you want, thisprocess adds an unnecessary step.andM;When a new frame overlays any part of an existing one, you can choose the way in which these frames will interact.andP;  The top one can be madetransparent,  permitting the contents of the bottom one to show through, oropaque, removing  the bottom one from sight; six other options are alsoavailable, providing a  good range of special effects.andP;  Alignment.andP;  You cancreate alignment grids, specifying margins, the number of  columns and rows,and the spacing between them.andP;  Selected objects can be aligned  to thesegrids (which can be displayed or invisible).andP;  Objects can also be  aligned toeach other vertically, horizontally, by centers or by any  combination ofthese measurements.andP;  Object manipulation.andP;  Objects can be grouped into asingle object (a feature  that PageMaker lacks) and ungrouped They can besent to the front or back so  that they will appear on top of or behindeverything else on a page.andP;  They ca be  locked to prevent accidentalalteration or deletion-a nice touch.andM;Any frame-text or graphic-can be rotated in one-degree increments.andP;  If the angle of rotation is not a multiple of 90 degrees, then the rotated frame is represented on the screen only by a rotated rectangle; its elements are not shown.andP;  All elements print at the proper rotation, though.andP;  Master andscratch pages.andP;  PIM offers an overall master page, for items that  willappear on every page of the document, and left and right master pages.andP;  In setting up the document, you can also have it begin with a distinet titlepage,  as we have done in this article.andM;Elements created on a master page are not editable on the actual pages.andP;  Thisprotection from inadvertent changes is salutary, but it sometimes makes  lifedifficult.andP;  Because we wanted to put a full-page sidebar on a right-hand page, we could not place our vertical rules on the right-hand master page; wehad to create them on the first available right-hand page in the actual document, then use the &quot;replicate&quot; command to add them to succeedingright-hand  pages.andM;We did create our headers and footers on the appropriate master pages.andP;  We took advantage of PIM's automatic page numbering, which can be specified as Arabic or Roman numerals or as letters.andP;  Other available special textincludes  automatic date and time stamps that are updated whenever that textframe is  displayed or printed.andM;Like PageMaker, PIM lets you create elements outside a document so that you can later place them in a document.andP;  It does so by providing an optional &quot;scratch page.&quot;andP;  Sample layouts.andP;  In a move clearly aimed at QuarkStyle (seeVol.andP;  3, No.andP;  3, p. 35), Timeworks has included more than 70andM;predesigned page layouts in PIM.andP;  They cover common business and personalandM;applications, from memos and reports to purchase orders to newsletters andandM;invitations.andM;Not being design professionals, we are poorly qualified to judge theandM;relative merit of these designs.andP;  Although Timeworks did not hire a tonygroupandM;of high-profile designers for its sample layouts (as Quark did forandM;QuarkStyle), the PIM layouts passed our admittedly uninformed inspection.andM;Word processingandM;Publish-It for the Mac goes beyond the basic word processing features foundinandM;most desktop composition software.andP;  It offers a large spelling checker andandM;thesaurus as well as good text manipulation capabilities.andM;Text can only be entered into an existing text frame.andP;  Any necessary framesandM;are constructed when the document is laid out; they can be moved, resized andandM;so forth as needed later.andM;Timeworks included some niceties that aren't in all word processors (butandM;should be).andP;  For instance, when a word is selected with a double click, anandM;adjoining space is also selected, so that a deletion or cut-and-pasteandM;operation does not leave incorrect amounts of space between words.andP;  AnotherandM;welcome feature: automatic conversion of foot and inch marks into trueandM;apostrophes and quotation marks.andM;Nobody is about to switch from a dedicated word processor to PIM merely toandM;create text.andP;  But as integrated features for use in composition and layout,andM;PIM's word processing capabilities are relatively strong.andM;Import/export.andP;  When it imports a file from MacWrite, Microsoft Word orandM;WordPerfect, PIM retains formatting information.andP;  It can also import WriteNowandM;files and any ASCII file.andP;  We brought in files created in MacWrite and WriteandM;Now and found that PIM preserved text attributes, indents, bulleted lists,andandM;other elements.andM;The program cannot yet export text created within it; Timeworks plans toandM;institute ASCII export in release 1.2.andM;Find and replace.andP;  In addition to text strings, the program can search on,andandM;replace with, an impressive number of attributes: font, size, type style,andM;shading or pattern of the text, stretch or compression factor, and leading.andM;You can also choose whether or not to match the case of the text string   being replaced.andP;  So, for example, if you wanted to change all 10-on-12-pointandM;Helvetica underlined text that was stretched 10% to 11-on-13 Galliard boldandM;italic text stretched 5%, you could do so.andP;  This routine is almost tooandM;intricate; as with all programs, the user should not try to figure out waystoandM;use unusual functions just because they are there.andM;PIM's find-and-replace routine is not as powerful as updating a style tagandM;(see &quot;Composition&quot;), but it can serve much the same purpose.andM;The routine contains a common falling: It doesn't always bring the columnandM;containing the  found&quot; text into full view as long as the found text stringisandM;visible in the current view.andM;Spelling checking and synonyms.andP;  The 160,000-word Proximity spelling checkerandM;can be used interactively  beeping when a typed word does not match its list)andM;or as a batch operation.andP;  When the program flags an error, you can view afistandM;of (usually about ten) words of which the flagged one might be a misspelling.andM;You can also add words to the dictionary.andM;Timeworks supplies its own 240,000-word thesaurus; a list of synonyms forandM;a selected word appears on command.andM;Tabs.andP;  The category of tabs could fall under either word processing orandM;composition.andP;  PIM offers a good selection of tab features.andP;  You can set tabsatandM;uniform intervals across a text frame, or you can create custom tabs, whichandM;can be ordinary, decimal (for aligning the decimal points in columns ofandM;numbers), or for left-justified, right-justified or centered text.andP;  One tipandM;that is missing from the manual: you must be careful when using aandM;right-justified or centered tab format to press OPTION-space between wordsandM;rather than just space; otherwise, the justifying tab has the desired effectandM;only on the first word that is typed after the tab key is used to reach it.andM;You can set up a leader character for custom tab fields-either theandM;period, the dash or an underscore.andM;Composition The biggest danger of trying to do everything-in this case, wordandM;processing, layout, composition and graphics-is that it's hard to doandM;everything well.andP;  In the case of Publish-It for the Mac, Timeworks has doneandM;well in most areas, but there are glaring deficiencies in its compositionandM;features.andM;On the plus side, it lets you specify type in increments far finer thanandM;PageMaker's, and it offers tracking (albeit somewhat clumsily).andP;  On the minusandM;side, though, it lacks adequate hyphenation, widow and orphan control,optimumandM;wordspacing, and a reasonable way to make case fractions.andM;Even though Timeworks is not targeting designers, typesetters or adandM;compositors as its main market, it must improve its composition to make anyandM;headway in the business world.andP;  These weaknesses might not matter in theandM;low-end arena in which the company's other programs compete, but at thehigherandM;end they can be deadly.andP;  Typography.andP;  Text sizes can be specified inandM;1/250-point increments; PageMaker burdened its user with integral point sizesandM;unti last month, when Aldus released version 3.02 with half-point sizes.andM;Text can be stretched and compressed in one-percent ratios.andP;  Like thecontents of any frame, it can be rotated inandM;one-degree increments, reversed, or flipped (horizontally orandM;vertically), but those operations apply only to aU the contentsandM;of a frame; you cannot simply flip or rotate a word.andM;Kerning can be performed automatically, based on theandM;kerning data resident in the font.andP;  You can also kern manually in those sameandM;1/250-point increments.andP;  Within the kern submenu, you can specify that allandM;characters in a selected area be kerned closer by an absolute amount; this isandM;a start toward tracking, but we would like to see several specific tracks,andM;definable in relative units (fractions of an em).andM;A font substitution dialog box makes global font changes easy; this isandM;handy when you plan to share a file with someone whose Mac may not have allandM;the fonts yours does.andM;Fractions.andP;  In the first release of any program, some areas are bound to beandM;overlooked.andP;  That is a fact of life.andP;  One of those areas in PIM is theandM;construction of fractions.andM;Automatic fractions are a necessity for nearly any kind of document.andP;  TheandM;only true revulsion we experienced when scanning PIM's manuals came duringtheandM;description of how users should create fractions.andP;  The operation goes asandM;follows: type the numerator, a slash, and the denominator; define theandM;numerator, shift its baseline up three points, and make it &quot;the next smallerandM;point size&quot;; then perform the same operation (except move the baseline downandM;three points) on the denominator.andM;Not only is this operation time-consuming, it is inexact, producing uglyandM;fractions, and it plays havoc with the leading of surrounding lines.andM;Timeworks: please build an automatic fraction routine into the next release.andM;Dropped capitals.andP;  Also nice, though somewhat less urgent, would be an easywayandM;to create dropped initial caps.andP;  As it stands, the best way to do this is toandM;create a separate text frame just to hold the cap, then make the existingtextandM;run around that frame.andP;  Because the frame extends farther than the character,andM;this method produces poor results if you want the other text to run aroundtheandM;frame (rather than around the shape of the character); for instance, if theandM;dropped capital is three lines high, the frame is likely to protrude into theandM;fourth line, making that text also flow around it.andM;Hyphenation.andP;  The program's automatic hyphenation, from a Proximity algorithmandM;supplemented by a relatively small exception dictionary, is satisfactory atandM;its basest level.andP;  But the user has so little control over its parametersthatandM;it cannot be recommended for documents where aesthetics are important.andP;  YouandM;cannot modify the hyphenation dictionary (though    you can insertdiscretionary hyphens on a word-by-word basis); nor can youandM;specify the minimum length of a word to be hyphenated, the minimum number ofandM;letters to appear before or after a hyphen, or the allowable number ofandM;consecutive lines ending in hyphens.andM;Turning automatic hyphenation on loads the hyphenation dictionary and programkernel, reducing the amountandM;of free memory by about 40K.andP;  When we had turned hyphenationandM;on for a document, quitting the program and thenandM;calling the document back up (reentering the program) returnedandM;us to the default state of &quot;hyphenation off.&quot;andM;There are two especially serious deficiencies in the hyphenatandM;ionandM;routine.andP;  When you are typing, the program waits until there are fiveandM;syllables on a line before it tries to move part of a word there to theandM;previous line.andP;  This approach can leave loose lines whenever a paragraph endsandM;with a short final line.andM;In the paragraph before this one, for instance, the &quot;fi&quot; in &quot;andM;final&quot; cameandM;up when we added two words to the last line, but it came backandM;down when weandM;deleted those words.andP;  We know that some publishers prefer not to have thelastandM;full line of a paragraph hyphenated, but changing that requirement once threeandM;or four words appear on the last line seems haphazard.andM;Even worse, the program will never hyphenate consecutive lineandM;s.andP;  Yes-noandM;matter how loose a line is, if the preceding one ends in a hyphenandM;(as in thisandM;paragraph), it can contain only whole words.andM;If there are default values for the shortest hyphenatable worandM;d or forandM;the minimum number of letters before or after a hyphen, they mustandM;be small.andM;Many desktop publishers would be unhappy if they saw four-letter words, suchandM;as area, hyphenated in their documents.andM;Even though it has the cutest wait-I'm-hyphenating icon we'veandM;seen,andM;PIM's hyphenation must be improved, preferably by giving the userandM;controlandM;over its parameters.andP;  Otherwise, the program cannot be used for seriousandM;composition.andM;Justification.andP;  Text can be flush left, flush right, or centered; it ca alsobeandM;flush&quot; (justified), with o without letterspacing enabled.andM;You can choose to have the last line of each paragraph justified, also withorandM;withoutandM;letterspacing.andM;You can specify the minimumandM;and maximum word spaces, both in multiples of theandM;spacing value built into the font; the minimum can range from .75 to 1 timesandM;that number, and the maximum can be anywhere from 1 to 4 times it.andP;  YouandM;cannot, however, specify the optimum word space.andP;  A good justificationroutineandM;would start at the user-defined optimum spacing, then alternately contractandM;toward the minimum and expand toward the maximum in its search for aandM;justified line.andM;Timeworks' justification routine starts by building a line with each wordandM;space the size of an em space, fitting as many full words there as possible.andM;If it can bring up the next word without making the word spaces smaller thanthe user-  defined minimum, it will do so.andP;  Otherwise, it attempts tohyphenate that word  (subject to the unfortunate constraints of thehyphenation parameters) and to  bring up as many syllables as will fit.andM;The amount of permissible letterspacing is user-definable in relative units-multiples of the font's spacing value.andM;A &quot;raggedness&quot; setting lets you create ragged right margins by specifying that interletter and interword space be reduced by a given percentage fromwhat  they would be in justified text.andP;  This feature produces text that fallsanywhere  on the continuum between fully ragged and fully justified,depending on the  user's preference.andM;Vertical justification comes in four flavors.andP;  Text can be centered vertically in the text frame; the last line can sit on the bottom of the textframe; the first line can sit just below the top of the text frame; or, in &quot;full,&quot; the program adds equal amounts of space between each line so that thefirst line is at the top of the frame and the last line is at the bottom.andP;  In&quot;full&quot; vertical justification, the program does not differentiate between interline and interparagraph spacing; a separate menu controls the latter.andM;Four special forms of justification are also offered: left slant and right slant, which slant both margins at an angle determined by the width of thetext  frame, and pyramid and vee, which slant the left and right margins inopposite  directions.andP;  These effects apply only to the full contents of atext frame; it  would be nice to have them for smaller blocks.andP;  Runarounds.andO;PIM's runarounds are of mixed quality.andP;  Text can be run  automatically aroundor inside either a frame or the contents of that frame  (text or a graphic).andO;You define the runaround margin and tell the program whether or not to  runtext only around the outside  of objects, only in front of text,  or onlyaround opaque objects.andP;  Runarounds tend to produce short lines, whichhighlight hyphenation and  justification  deficiencies.andP;  Notice the manyloose lines around the graphic at left.andP;  Giving  the   user control overhyphenation would make runaround text far more attractive.andP;  Anothertypographic problem in PIM's runaround's is that paragraph indents  (such asthe one at the start of this sentence are lost if the horizontal shift caused  by the runaround is at least as large as the indent.andM;Style sheets.andP;  PIM offers style sheet options that are roughlyandM;comparable to PageMaker's but far short of ReadySetGo's.andM;Called a &quot;paragraph tag,&quot; a style sheet applies only to anandM;entire paragraph.andP;  It records font, size, style, stretch or com-andM;pression ratio, text fill pattern, leading, indents, justification,    tabs,baseline adjustments, leading, raggedness, and word-space parameters.andM;The user defines and names each tag.andM;Because the paragraph tags cannot handle elements smaller than aandM;paragraph, our lead-ins, as in the paragraph above, had to be createdandM;manually.andM;PIM also lets you construct and store templates f in creating similarandM;documents.andP;  Like elements created on master pages, those created in templatesandM;are not editable in an actual document.andM;Text flow.andP;  When creating a document, you can use master pages to createandM;matching text frames on each page, or you can define (and link) text framesandM;separately for each page using the &quot;place columns&quot; command, which specifiestheandM;number of columns and their placement.andP;  By clicking on them in order with aandM;tool, you can link any text frames so that a story will automatically flowandM;from one to the next.andP;  The process is fairly primitive; Timeworks isdevelopingandM;more advanced autoflow features for release 1.2.andM;You can add a note when a story is continued from or to another page, andandM;the program will automatically update the page number in that note (usingandM;Roman or Arabic numerals or A, B, C, etc.) as changes warrant.andM;Although PIM has excellent facilities for locking frames, so that theyandM;can't be resized, moved, deleted, etc., it does not let you lock the textandM;within a text frame.andP;  This is not as vital as some other missing features,butandM;it would certainly be handy to have it.andM;Widows and orphans.andP;  We know that Timeworks didn't design this program foruseandM;in preparing long documents, so our disappointment at finding no widow orandM;orphan controls is tempered.andP;  Even in a relatively short document, though,andM;last-minute changes are likely to introduce widows and orphans, and it shouldandM;not be left to the operator to find and fix them.andM;GraphicsandM;Publish-It for the Mac excels in creating graphics.andP;  Its complementandM;of raster and vector graphic tools would be the envyandM;of some dedicated graphics programs.andM;Importing.andP;  PIM can import paint-type and draw-type graphics, EncapsulatedandM;PostScript graphics and scanned graphics (for which Timeworks recommends TIFFandM;format).andP;  It can import only black-and-white TIFF files, not grayscale orcolorandM;ones.andM;All imported graphics can be cropped and resized.andP;  PICT (draw-type) and EPSandM;graphics cannot be edited in their natural state; if changes are to be made,andM;these images must be converted into bitmaps.andM;Creating.andP;  We listed under &quot;User interface&quot; the icons in the draw and paintandM;palettes.andP;  In addition to a wide array of standard shapes and effects, PIMhasandM;two unusual tools: one that changes text and vector graphics into bitmaps andandM;one thatandM;causes text frames or graphic objects to become part of a bitmap frame.&quot;andM;These tools make it easy to create special effects with text and with vectorandM;graphics.andP;  Once a nonraster element has been changed to a bitmap, of course,itandM;cannot be returned to its original state, and rasterized text cannot beeditedandM;as text.andM;You can specify the resolution of any raster graphic frame.andP;  If your MacandM;has sufficient memory, you can work on a graphic at the same resolution atandM;which it will print on a typesetter.andM;There are nearly 40 fill patterns to choose from, and shading can beandM;specified in 1170 increments.andM;Besides being rotated in single degrees, graphics can be flippedandM;horizontally or vertically or split into two half-size graphics.andM;Graphic frames (like text frames, though unlike the text inside them) canandM;be locked in any combination of six ways.andP;  You can stop them from beingandM;deleted, moved, copied or resized, or from having the fill pattern or certainandM;other attributes changed.andM;The package includes about a dozen files of clip art, ranging from aandM;collection of dingbats to representations of a 3.5&quot; floppy disk and aandM;Macintosh Plus.andM;In short, Publish-It for the Mac provides graphics tools that will fillandM;virtually any need of the average desktop publisher.andP;  We congratulateTimeworks on its graphics.andP;  Color PIN4 cannot handle process color.andP;  It doesprovide spot color on up to  eight separate layers (CMYK, RGB and invisible).andO;You can specify each frame as  being any of these colors, which are displayedproperly on a color monitor.andP;  Any  combination of color layers can be viewedat a time, and the layers can be  output separately.andP;  Colored elements can beoutput on a black-and-white or color  output device.andP;  The user manual givesinstructions for creating registration  marks.andP;  Documentation  Publish-It forthe Mac comes with three manuals: User, Reference, and  Quick-startMini-manual.&quot; They are well designed and easy to read, if  occasionally a bitsuperficial.andP;  (To thoroughly document every aspect of a  program this rich infeatures would require many hundreds of pages.) The  plentiful helps screensreinforce the manuals' teachings.andM;The User manual is the basic one: it groups all the feature into  categories(initial design, adding text, etc.).andP;  The Reference manual contains explanations of all of the program's tools and of every option within every menu or dialog box.andP;  With the Quick-start manual, inexperienced operatorsshould  pick up the basic concepts in a jiffy.andP;  Bugs and strange features What would a first release be without its share of flaws? No amount ofin-house  bulletproofing can fully prepare a program for the range of uses towhich it  will be put.andP;  During our testing, we scared up a few bugs and someother quirks  that we hope to see remedied.andM;For a first release, though, PIM is not bad in this area.andP;  Few of the oddities we encountered caused us real problems; most were simply minor inconveniences.andM;The computer crashed several successive times when we were trying to  performoperations that involved defining all of the text in the document.andM;Occasionally, a page consisting of &quot;flush&quot; (justified) text printed with just a few lines flushed left instead.andP;  Immediately reprinting the page oftencorrected some of those lines.andM;In some view modes, master page items did not always show up on succeeding pages.andP;  In one (repeatable) instance, scrolling around the page made thoseitems  disappear.andM;Making straight lines was a problem.andP;  We found that   unless we took greatpains in using the perpendicular line tool, rules created  with it were bothdisplayed and printed as crooked.andP;  (Incidentally, this tool  also creates45-degree lines, an undocumented feature.) Once, the entire lower  half of avertical rule simply wasn't displayed.andM;When we were looking at a multicolumn page, text from a column to theandM;left of the one on which we were working overran the vertical ruler, makingitandM;difficult to see hash marks and numbers there.andM;A few times when we tried to edit existing text, the cursor showed upandM;somewhere other than where its effects were felt.andP;  On these occasions, aandM;character entered at the keyboard was added to another word on the same lineandM;as the cursor rather than to the word where the cursor was.andM;When we told the program to insert hyphens into a paragraph containing aandM;word in compressed type, the hyphenation routine restored that word toregularandM;type while trying to hyphenate it.andP;  This is also true of some other characterandM;modes.andM;An infrequent screen redraw bug sometimes left characters that had beenandM;selected in reverse mode until a different part of the document wasdisplayed.andM;The Mac IIx sometimes crashed shortly after this bug occurred.andM;Importing one particular MacWrite file consistently crashed the systemandM;(even though it ended with a carriage return, as PIM's README filesuggested),andM;but we had no problem with others.andM;Like those of nearly every program we test, PIM's bugs crashed ourandM;computer more and more frequently as our publication deadline approached.andM;Murphy's Law?andP;  FuturesandM;Like any first release, Publish-It for the Mac 1.1 represented someandM;compromises, some dogmatic choices and a lot of best guesses.andP;  Initial userandM;feedback will tell the developers what the most vital enhancements will be.andM;Timeworks plans to ship version 1.2 in October.andP;  It will be largely aandM;maintenance upgrade, fixing bugs and addressing the commonest and loudestandM;complaints.andM;Considering the long lead time necessary for a software release,andM;Timeworks will likely have little time to focus on more than achieving thoseandM;two immediate goals.andP;  It is, however, planning two specific featureandM;enhancements: the ability to export, in ASCII format, text created withinPIM;andM;and autoflow capabilities that will make it easier to flow text between pagesandM;and to create text frames on succeeding pages automatically.andM;The first significant upgrade, version 2.0, is scheduled for the firstandM;half of 1990.andP;  We are told that it will offer greater user control (in areasandM;such as hyphenation, we hope) and that it will contain more sophisticatedandM;composition features, such as widow and orphan control.andM;Also in the first half of next year, Timeworks plans to release aandM;similarly powerful version of Publish-It for IBM and compatible PCs.andP;  BecauseandM;of that platform's relative weakness in graphics, the new Publish-It willlackandM;many of PIM's draw and paint features, but it will be comparable in otherandM;areas.andM;ConclusionandM;Will Publish-It for the Macintosh, version 1.1, knock PageMaker off itsperch?andM;No.andP;  Although it is cheaper, fairly simple to use, and very strong ingraphicsandM;and word processing, its deficiencies in composition and typography excludeitandM;from jobs where the appearance of the text matters.andM;Still, this program is impressive, especially for a first release.andM;(Although Timeworks' other desktop publishing programs are also calledandM;Publish-It, the company has embarked on creating a whole different level ofandM;functionahty with its Mac version, so we view it as a separate program.) WeandM;are eager to see which user-suggested enhancements appear in version 1.2, andandM;to see how much more user control has been programmed into version 2.0.andM;Eliminating a few of the most severe flaws-the lack of user control overandM;hyphenation, of automatic fractions, ofwidow and orphan control, etc.-wouldandM;improve the program tremendously.andM;Priorities.andP;  Each software developer must decide which facets of a programareandM;most important to its target audience.andP;  Finite resources and developmentandM;cycles mean that effort spent in one area is taken away from another.andM;In the case of PIM, Timeworks concentrated on its graphics, to theandM;detriment of composition and typography.andP;  We know that it is not aiming forandM;the Quark Xpress audience-users who care deeply about type aesthetics.andO;WithinandM;its target audience, advanced graphics features might be more valuable thanandM;adequate composition.andM;PIM's advanced graphic features make it suitable for users who areandM;producing graphically-oriented documents and who don't want to bothercreatingandM;graphics in a separate program and then importing them.andP;  As such, the timeandM;spent developing graphics has given Timeworks a competitive advantage in thatandM;niche.andM;A word of advice to Timeworks, though: The economics concept of decliningandM;marginal productivity also applies to software.andP;  Spending a number ofandM;programmer-hours on firming up its basic typographic features would make PIMandM;suitable for more new applications-and hence add more to its salesandM;potential-than would devoting that same time to improving the already-strongandM;graphics features.andM;Survival chances.andP;  If PIM matures as planned, we feel that it will beandM;attractive to a large market.andP;  Our readers, who are    more typographicallysophisticated than most desktop publishers, will find PI MandM;lacking.andP;  Users for whom graphics capabilities and a lower price matter moreandM;than good-looking type might, however, choose Publish-It for the Mac overandM;PageMaker, especially after the former has been on the market long enough toandM;gain a higher profile and to instill confidence.andM;Converting current PageMaker users is a far different kettle of fish.andM;Their investment, not only in software but in training and in existingdocuments and templates, is largeandM;enough to require an overwhelmingly strong reason to switch.andP;  AnyandM;program thaandM;tandM;wants to grab PageMaker customers must, as a bare minimum, read PageMakerandM;files and templates.andP;  Unless a PageMaker user falls in love with PIM'sandM;integrated graphics, we can't see sufficient reason for a crossover.andM;There is, however, a constant stream-nay, flood-of new would-be desktopandM;publishers making software choices.andP;  PIM offers enough to bring some of theminto its fold.andM;Sure, other promising challengers have come and gone.andP;  But judging from the current program's sophistication, from its niche in powerful integrated graphics, and especially from Timeworks' strong lower-end base and apparent commitment to improving its higher-end software, we think that Publish-It forthe Mac is unlikely to fade away soon.andP;   Producing this article withPublish-itandM;The process.andP;  After Timeworks gave us a copy of Publish-It for the MacintoshinandM;early July, we installed it on our Mac SE's hard disk and began to examineit.andM;As is our custom, we tested the program in several ways, including using ittoandM;produce its own review.andP;  Here is how we did so.andM;We began by creating a ten-page document with a separate title page and leftandM;and right master pages.andP;  On each of the master pages, we placed theappropriateandM;header and footer information, including automatic page numbering.andP;  On theleftandM;master pages, we placed our text frames (columns) and vertical rules; wecouldandM;not do so on the right master page because we planned to put sidebars on twoandM;right-hand pages.andP;  We created these frames and rules on the first availableandM;right-hand page and used the &quot;replicate&quot;  command to reproduce them as neededandM;on other right-hand pages.andP;  We then used the thumbnail view to link all textandM;frames.andM;Moving to the right-hand pages without rules and text frames, we built textandM;frames for our sidebars (the company overview and the one you are reading).andM;Having constructed the pages, we began to enter text.andP;  We started at theandM;&quot;size-to-fit&quot; view, then hit the &quot;double size&quot; command key sequence twice; onandM;our SE's built-in monitor, the resulting display showed slightly more thanoneandM;column of text, so it was easy to read the characters.andP;  As we went along, weandM;set up paragraph tags: subheads, paragraphs beginning with lead-ins, bodyandM;text, etc.andM;Adding graphics was the next step.andP;  We imported the U.S.andP;  map, an imageprovidedandM;with the program, and set up an automatic text runaround.andP;  Then we used KeithandM;Esau's Camera desk accessory to capture program menus and dialog boxes asandM;paint graphics.andP;  We imported these images and used PIM's graphic tools tocropandM;and resize them.andM;We ran out page proofs on an Apple LaserWriter IINTX.andP;  When itandM;was time to print actual pages, we sent them to our L200P Post-andM;Script imagesetter (on loan from Linotype).andM;Our experiences.andP;  Apart from a system crash once a day or so, which mighthaveandM;been caused by hardware or software, we had few rude surprises.andP;  The biggestandM;bother was the bug that frequently placed the visible cursor somewhereandM;besides where the program thought the cursor was.andP;  We would start deleting aandM;word, only to find that a nearby one was being eaten instead.andM;Occasionally the program warned us that our (1-MB) SE was running low onandM;memory and advised us to save our work.andP;  By clicking on the status windowandM;after saving, we released temporarily unneeded RAM hogs such as the spellingandM;checker and continued on our merry way.andP;  As we added text and (especially)andM;raster graphics, our document took up more memory (about 160K in its finalandM;version); in the latter stages, we had to move it to an 8-MB Mac IIx.andM;The program was often sluggish on the SE (although not on a Mac 11), and weandM;had to figure out tricks to speed it back up.andP;  Performing batch rather thanandM;interactive hyphenation made the program more responsive during text entry.andM;So did temporarily disabling any text runarounds that would be affected byandM;our text changes.andP;  Even so, extensive text entry should be quicker in a wordandM;processor.andP;  There is no alternative yet to working in PIM word processor onceandM;text has been placed in a document, but if version 1.2 can save PIM text inandM;ASCII format, exporting i dedicated word processor may be best for extensiveandM;changes.andM;Macintosh mavens might be tempted to jump in without bothering to readandM;manuals, but we're glad we didn't.andP;  From the  Quick-start Mini-manual&quot;andM;tutorial, which takes experienced computer users and publishers far less thanandM;the advertised 90 minutes, we gained a basic working familiarity with PIM'sfeatures.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
