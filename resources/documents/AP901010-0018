It's the first burial ground ever found for the Egyptian workingman of 45 centuries ago.   Five other cemeteries with 4,000 tombs flank the pyramids, onthe horizon above. But all 4,000 were reserved for royalty, theirfamilies and officials, said Zahi Hawass, director-general ofantiquities for the pyramids area and the new dig's excavationchief.   ``What we haven't found until now is the working class,'' saidHawass. ``We were shocked when we looked at inscriptions of who wasburied in the new tombs. Overseers holding their sticks. Andbehind, skeletons of workers.''   He said it appears the workers were members of the foremen'screws.   The first eight tombs, three miles south of the Sphinx, lie atthe base of sand hills stretching endlessly into the desert. Hawasssaid the cemetery undoubtedly extends deep into the dunes.   Tombs date from the fourth dynasty - 4,600 years ago when theGiza pyramids were built - until the sixth, 300 years later. It's amysterious period when legend says workers grew tired of almightypharaohs and of building pyramids for them.   Because no middle-class burials had been discovered on sacredGiza plateau, some Egyptologists have theorized that the afterlifewas perceived as off-limits to the working man. But the newcemetery proves that pharaonic blue-collar workers prepared foreternity as their betters did, being buried with amulets, limestonetablets, offering tables, pottery vessels and more.   The largest tomb, built for a fifth-dynasty overseer namedPtah-Shepses, is 20 feet by 6{ feet with an arched ceiling.   To the rear of the tomb, in a honeycomb of compartments,excavators found six skeletons buried in the fetal position. Hawasssaid they were members of one work crew.   Ancient Egyptians didn't practice human sacrifice, so theworkers were not killed and buried at the same time as theirbosses. And Hawass said there's no indication so far how a foremanchose the workers to be buried near him.   ``Perhaps they were his favorites. Or perhaps we'll find otherswhen we keep digging,'' Hawass said. ``We have no idea how manypeople an overseer would have had on his staff.''   Foremen handled day-to-day administration of the pharaohs'estates, with responsibilities comparable to farm managers orassembly-line supervisors in today's world. ``They dressed better,ate better and wanted better tombs than the men who worked forthem,'' Hawass said.   ``They looked at the pyramids and the fancy tombs of theofficials. They knew they couldn't afford such luxury. Still theywanted a nice place to spend eternity.''   More information about the ancient blue-collar workers will comefrom medical tests Egyptian doctors are performing on theskeletons. Data is expected to indicate the workers' generalappearance, their height and weight, what they ate, what diseasesbothered them, even what killed them.   In 1987, Hawass and Egyptologist Mark Lehner of Yale Universitybegan a search for homes of workers who built the three Gizapyramids. At a site some distance from the monuments, theyuncovered ruins of a business center and other artifacts.   They stopped excavating in early 1988. The recently discoveredtombs lay undetected only a few feet away.   But early last summer, a tourist hired a saddle horse for a ridearound the pyramids. During the tour her horse fell through thesand, ending on top of what proved to be the roof of the firsttomb.   Nobody got the tourist's name, and chances are she still doesn'tknow her outing made history.   For years, riders heading for the most spectacular view of thepyramids have passed in front of the Sphinx and through an ancientstone gate into the desert.   No records existed to explain the gate.   But ``once we found the cemetery we understood,'' Hawass said.``The gate divided the world of the pharaohs from the world of theaverage man.''   He explained that the foremen and their crews lived and wereburied in their own world behind the gate. By day they passedthrough the gate into their pharaoh's sacred world, then returnedat sunset to work on their own tombs.</TEXT></DOC>
