Clambering across a plywood crag may lack the visceral thrillsof scaling a 300-foot cliff in upstate New York or a soaring spirein the Rockies. But the fake wall that opened Oct. 12 offersclimbers a chance to practice most of the basic rock moves.   And more important, it's close to home.   ``It's great,'' said Pierre Vaz, one of about 60 climbers whoturned out for opening festivities. ``This is a perfect time for itto open, because it's starting to get nippy outside.''   The wall, in a little-used city recreation center on West 59thSreet not far from the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts,occupies one end of an old paddleball court.   Sheets of three-quarter inch plywood are bolted to the20-foot-high wall in replicas of the shapes climbers seek innature: an overhanging cliff face; a narrow chimney; knife-edgedarete, or buttress; a two-foot roof jutting out horizontally.   Bolted to the wall are knobby holds cast of sand and plasticresin in a variety of shapes, from easily grasped ``buckets'' topockets just big enough to grasp with one finger, to narrow,sloping edges that offer minimum purchase for fingertips or toes.   Protected by safety ropes, climbers puzzle out routes to thetop, or move delicately from one side of the wall to the other inthat vertical ballet mountaineers call traversing.   Installing the wall was more a political feat than a technicalone.   About 18 months ago, climbers who keep their skills sharp byworking out on boulders in Central Park found the rangers seemed tobe making a special effort to chase them away. Normally adisorganized lot, they formed a loose alliance called the CityClimbers Club of New York to lobby parks officials to call off thetroops.   Organizer Ralph Erenzo says he was pleasantly surprised to findcity officials receptive to the new club's overtures.   They quickly agreed to call off the rangers if the climberswould agree to avoid a few well-traveled spots.   Then, when the climbers mentioned they were worried abouttwisting their ankles on rocks sticking out of the ground at thebase of their favorite 20-foot cliff, ``Rat Rock,'' the city sentin a backhoe to clear the ground and laid in a layer ofshock-absorbing wood chips.   ``The club gave us credibility,'' said Erenzo, 38, who has abusiness designing and building exhibits for trade shows. ``Itshowed them we weren't a bunch of yahoos.''   It turned out Erenzo's contact in the parks hierarchy was eagerto encourage off-beat sports. William Castro, the Parks andamp;Recreation Department's assistant commissioner for recreation,already had helped organize Frisbee championships, skateboardcontests and BMX bicycle exhibitions.   And Castro had dabbled with climbing in an Outward Bound-styleconfidence-building program the city offers for teen-agers.   ``There's a thrill from it that I don't think you get in manyorganized sports _ you're challenging yourself and seeing whatyou're made of,'' Castro said. ``It's a real test of theindividual.''   When Erenzo started talking about artificial walls, the city'sbiggest worry was the risk of someone falling and filing a lawsuit.   In several months of lobbying, Erenzo showed Castro thatartificial climbing walls are becoming increasingly common andsophisticated in Europe, and are slowly coming to this country. Thebest known is at Snowbird, Utah, where a huge fiberglass scarp wasthe site of the International Sport Climbing Championships inAugust.   Erenzo, who has been climbing for a decade and helped judge theSnowbird contest, worked to convince city officials his sport issafe if pursued responsibly. The climbers demonstrated how theyhang a rope from the top of a practice cliff, so a partner cancatch a climber who slips from the rock within a foot or two.   After a slide show by leading French wall designer Jean MarcBlanche, Castro decided to give the idea a try, and offered theskylit paddleball court in the underused recreation center.   Everyone involved realizes the wall isn't accident-proof, butthey've developed a system to lessen the legal risk. Climbers mustsign a form releasing the city from liability and pay a nominalsign-up fee; they must supply their own ropes and gear; they mustfollow safety rules that will be enforced by a parks employee.   City carpenters built the wall at an estimated cost of $4,000.The climbers club raised $500 and the American Alpine club chippedin $500 for the resin-cast holds, which are produced commerciallyby several small companies.   Even as the first climbers tested the feel of the new wall, clubmembers and officials were talking about expanding the effort. Ifthe wall proves popular, Castro said others may go up in one or twoother spots around the city.   And the permits climbers sign to use the wall will also entitlethem to hassle-free climbing at selected rock outcroppings in cityparks _ as long as they display the permit on their ``posterioraspect.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Weekend Editions, Oct. 21-22</NOTE></DOC>
