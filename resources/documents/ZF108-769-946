(products).andO;Product:   QuarkXPress 3.0 (Desktop publishing software) (evaluation).andO;Topic:     EvaluationDesktop PublishingSoftware Packages.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>WE SOMETIMES classify publishing applications according to where they fallalong a style spectrum, with layout-driven pieces (display ads, brochures,magazines) at one end and highly structured technical documents (likemil-spec manuals) at the other.andP;  Programs such as Interleaf and VenturaPublisher clearly fan at one end of that line; they have features that areoriented toward automating the production of long, standardized and complexpublications.andP;  Page-Maker occupies the middle of the line, with some featuresthat appeal to designers  especially those who grew up with razors and wax)and others that help produce the routine and repetitive work.andP;  RagTime (which has been much more successful in Europe than in North America) isattempting to carve out a niche of its own as a multipurpose tool.andM;Quark Xpress(1) clearly falls all the way at the layout-driven end.andP;  Itsfeatures are tuned toward the creative designer who wants to experiment witha variety of forms before picking two or three to present to a client, thegraphic artist who wants color and rotated type, the magazine publisher whosefront page is never the same two weeks in a row.andP;  With the arrival of version3, Xpress has strengthened its appeal for users at this end of the spectrum.andM;Comparisons.andP;  In our June 1990 issue (Vol.andP;  4, No.andP;  10), we ran a chart offeature-by-feature comparisons among Xpress 3.0, PageMaker 4.0, DesignStudio1.0 and Ventura Publisher Gold Series.andP;  (A future issue will compare Ventura,Interleaf and FrameMaker.) Although we had only a pre-release copy of Xpressto work with in preparing that article, the feature descriptions there areaccurate and we will not repeat that material here, except where it helps toexplain the program's operation or point up a competitive advantage one wayor the other.andM;However, we erred in preparing the handamp;j samples (the Kennedy speech) due toour misunderstanding of how Xpress was applying the wordspacing parameters.andO;The samples weren't bad, but were set tighter than we expected.andP;  As you cansee from these pages, Xpress can do better if properly instructed.andP;  Gammatest.andP;  Nearly all software developers conduct in-house bug hunts (alphatests) and give pre-release copies to selected users for field trials (betatesting) before they turn the product loose to sink or swim in the market.andO;Quark did all that for Xpress 3.0.andP;  We had a revised beta-test version(code-named Eve) in time for our June comparison chart article.andP;  But Quarkthen went to the extra effort of sending copies of a dress-rehearsal(gamma-test) version to several hundred typesetting service bureaus.andP;  Asexpected, this &quot;service bureau release&quot; turned up some hitherto-unsuspectedbugs, which were fixed before the product was shipped to paying customers.andM;Those bugs would otherwise have lain in wait, annoying the users, raisingQuark's technical support costs and diminishing its reputation for productquality.andP;  So even though it delayed product revenues by four or five weeks,it was an astute decision.andP;  There was also a side benefit: it gave asubstantial public-relations boost in a market segment that Quark regards asessential.andM;Organization.andP;  In writing this article, we focused on the changes fromearlier versions of Xpress.andP;  A full description of the program would havetaken many more pages; we didn't feel like writing that much copy and wedoubt that you would want to read it.andP;  A capsule description of the programappears in the sidebar on page 18.andM;We produced the camera-ready pages for this article using the program we werereviewing.andP;  A description of our method and our experiences appears on page26.andP;  We ran out the final pages on a Birmy PowerPrint 11/17, a 960x480-dpiplain-paper printer that will be the subject of a future article.andM;User interfaceandM;Quark fans will notice a big change here.andP;  The user interface has beencompletely reworked, making it easier for the occasional user withoutsacrificing the functionality that a full-timer needs.andP;  Most obviously, thereare now three little  floating windows' in front of the document window.andO;Less obviously, but more significantly, objects in Xpress no longer have achild-parent relationship to their containers.andP;  And there is now a pasteboardaround the page; you can stash objects there temporarily while you fiddlewith the page design.andM;Windoids.andP;  In earlier versions of Xpress, the tool palette was drawn alongthe left side of each document's window.andP;  You could also get some layoutinformation from a measurements bar across the bottom of the window.andP;  InXpress 3, the tool palette has been relocated to a windoid, a floating windowthat is always in front of the active document.andP;  (Aldus invented the floatingtool palette in the original version of PageMaker, and many programs haveadopted it since then.) By default, the windoid opens at the left, but youcan move the windoid anywhere on the screen that suits your fancy; on a Mac11, you can move it onto a second screen.andP;  You can hide the windoid (click inits close box or give a menu command) to free up the maximum display acreagefor your document.andM;There are new tools in the tool palette: a freehand rotation tool that letsyou rotate a text or graphic container with the mouse and an irregularpolygon tool for creating picture containers of any shape.andP;  A magnifyingglass tool zooms the screen view up or down by a settable scaling factor.andM;Another windoid holds the measurements palette.andP;  Unlike earlier versions,which just displayed a selected object's position  along with font name andsize of text), the new palette is also a control dialog.andP;  You can edit thevalues that are displayed, and when you press the enter key, the programaccepts your keystrokes as a command.andP;  Thus you can move objects to new x/ycoordinates by merely typing over any of the current measurements.andP;  To changesize or font, you can type in the new number or font name (or just enoughletters to identify the name uniquely; the program will fill in the rest), oryou can pick the new value from a popup menu.andM;All of the old ways of specifying type-the menus, style sheets and keyboardcommands-are still present.andP;  Similarly, the old ways of positioningobjects--dragging with the mouse or opening a property-sheet dialog-stillwork.andP;  The new measurements windoid simply adds another way of making themost common adjustments quickly and easily.andM;Arithmetic.andP;  We would also like to call your attention to a nice touch.andP;  Inaddition to typing new values for object position and size, you can modifyany property sheet or measurement window number as a displacement from itscurrent value.andP;  For example, if the height of some object is 13 picas, youcan insert &quot;+5cm&quot; to make it five centimeters bigger.andP;  When you hit the enterkey, the computer will perform the arithmetic-a radical concept indeed !andO;Nudging.andP;  Another way of moving objects is with the arrow keys: each keypressmoves the selected item in one-point increments.andP;  If you hold down the optionkey, an arrow key moves the selection in tenth-point increments.andP;  If youreally need more precision, the property sheet and the measurements mindowlet you type values to three decimal places.andM;There are arrow-buttons in the measurements windoid to bump type size orkerning/tracking values.andP;  These obey a similar rule: holding the option keywhile clicking an arrow-button causes the button action to move in smallerincrements.andM;Page arrangement.andP;  A third floating window gives an display of the currentarrangement of pages.andP;  The icons look a bit like PageMaker's page icons, butthey do a whole lot more.andP;  You can move the icons around to rearrange thepages, insert and delete pages, and apply master pages to document pages.andO;(We'll cover master pages farther along.) You can change a recto (right-hand)page into a verso  (left-hand) page by dragging its icon across the centerbar of the window.andP;  Single-sided pages don't have right- or left-handedness,and Quark provides a single-sided page icon to distinguish the casesvisually.andP;  This is handy, because Quark lets you mix single-sided andfacing-page layouts in the same document.andM;You might use this feature for a foldout, for example.andP;  Quark allows text orpicture containers to extend across multiple pages (see Children, below) onspreads up to 48&quot; wide.andP;  (This limit sounds arbitrary, but Quark says it isbased on QuickDraw's limitations.) In other words, you can now bid on thePlayboy account.andM;Thumbnails.andP;  You can work with your document at various magnifications.andO;There are the usual sizes on the menu: fit in window, actual size, and 50%,75% and 200%.andP;  In addition, you can type any number from 25% to 400% into ascale-value box at the bottom left corner of the document window; when youpress the enter key, the screen is zoomed to that magnification.andM;The magnifying glass tool is new, too.andP;  Clicking it zooms you up in 25%increments (press option to zoom down).andP;  The newly magnified view is centeredwhere you clicked.andP;  If you don't like 25% jumps, you can set the size of itsjumps in the preferences menu.andP;  But the magnifying tool has an even moreinteresting behavior: you can drag out a marquee rectangle of any size, andXpress will zoom to whatever scale makes that rectangle fill the screen.andM;All of these views are editable pages; the program will greek the text if itgets too small to show on the screen, but the software lets you manipulateeverything that is on the page.andM;There is also a non-editable thumbnails view.andP;  In this view, you can reorderpages by dragging the pages, just as you do in the page arrangement window bydragging icons.andP;  The thumbnails are small (about 10% scale), but they arelarger than icons and can give you some sense of what is on each page.andP;  Ifyou open two Xpress documents, you can drag whole pages and multipageselections from one to the other when both are set to the thumbnail view.andO;You cannot, however, move a page into a library.andM;The library.andP;  A fourth kind of windoid is used for libraries.andP;  A library is afancy scrapbook that can hold up to 2,000 Xpress objects: snippets of text,graphics, rules, containers and so on.andP;  An  object' can also be a collectionof things that were selected simultaneously and pasted into the library.andO;Each object is represented by a thumbnail sketch in the library window, andyou can scroll through the window looking for the item you want.andP;  When youfind it, just drag its icon out onto your page to paste down a copy of theitem.andM;Each object in the library can be given a name, if you wish.andP;  This is helpfulif you have even a moderate number of objects, because they are drawn to arather small scale and many kinds of things  end up  looking pretty similar.andO;The names are listed in a popup menu at the top of the library window;selecting a name from the menu scrolls the window instantly to show thecorresponding object.andM;On disk, a library is a file, so you can have as many libraries as youplease.andP;  You can have more than one library open on the screen, but the totalnumber of open document windows and library windows cannot exceed seven.andP;  (Ifyou are running Multifinder, you may bump up against your operating system'slimit on open files before you run out of Xpress windows.andP;  There are utilityprograms that can help with this problem.) You can cut and paste objectsbetween libraries using standard Mac conventions, or you can just drag thingsfrom one window to another, much as you would copy files from one disk toanother in the Finder.andM;Grown-up children.andP;  In earlier versions of Xpress, objects had a hierarchicalor parent-child relationship: if you created an object inside a container, itwas forever after linked to that container.andP;  You could not move it outsideits container or move it to another container.andP;  The advantage was that whenyou moved a container, all its children moved with it.andP;  But the disadvantagewas that it prevented you from changing your mind about the page layout-andchanging your mind is what design is all about.andM;Xpress 3.0 has abandoned the parent-child model.andP;  All objects are now peers.andO;However, you don't have to sacrifice the advantages the old model offered.andM;You can now select several objects (using the Mac's ordinary shift-click ormarquee selection conventions) and operate on them together.andP;  The collectioncan be moved, copied, colorized and pasted into libraries as a unit.andP;  Ofcourse, as soon as you select something else, the collection is disbanded.andO;If you want it to stay together for a while, you can &quot;group&quot; the objects by amenu command.andP;  The individual members of the collection then become acompound object that behaves like a single, indivisible item until youungroup it.andM;By setting the Auto Constrain option in the Preferences dialog, you canemulate the behavior of earlier versions of Xpress.andP;  All objects will then becreated as children of the container they begin in and will be forbidden toleave home.andP;  They can be moved freely within the container, but areconstrained to stay within the boundaries of the container; when thecontainer is moved, all the children move with it in lockstep.andM;Since containers are always children of the page they are on, this means thatyou can't move things from page to page unless you first unconstrain them bya menu command.andM;Have your cake and eat it too.andP;  If you select a group of objects that arewholly within a container, you can constrain just those objects.andP;  Thereafter,the objects behave like children of that container.andP;  You can unconstrain themlater.andM;Preferences.andP;  Xpress lets you set default properties for most of its objects:guide lines, units of measurement, tools, text and graphic containers, stylesheets and so on.andP;  Any preferences you set while a document is open on thescreen are stored in the document.andP;  If no document is open, the settings arestored within Xpress itself (more precisely, in the Xpress Data file) andbecome the defaults for all newly created documents.andP;  Documentation.andP;  Likethe on-screen user interface, the documentation for Xpress has beencompletely overhauled.andP;  There are now three manuals: a tutorial guide, areference manual and a volume titled Using QuarkXPress.andP;  All are indexed.andO;The reference manual and Using are cross-referenced to each other, both inthe text and in the index.andM;We found that the explanations of functions and commands were clear andgenerally well illustrated.andP;  We had no trouble finding information, andpicked up a few useful hints along the way.andP;  Xpress has always had lots ofneat features; the new documentation makes them quite accessible.andM;Xpress 3.0's online help function is similar to version 2's.andP;  Accessedthrough the customary  About QuarkXPress...&quot; function under the Apple menu,it consists of a condensed description of all the menus and keyboard codes.andO;We used it extensively, because we began this review before the manuals wereprinted.andP;  We've seen snazzier help systems-this one could be improved byadding a keyword-search function-but it is effective.andM;Text editingandM;Quark has beefed up the text-editing features of Xpress 3.0 with twoenhancements.andM;* Document-wide spelling checker and search/replace.andP;  Earlier versions ofXpress had a spelling checker, but you had to check each story (chain oflinked text containers) separately.andP;  Now you can teff Xpress to check everystory in the document.andM;Similarly, the basic text find/change function now can scan all stories atonce.andM;Default dictionary.andP;  As noted above, preferences that you set when there isno document on the screen are saved in Xpress and become the default for new,blank documents.andM;By the same token, if you open a custom spelling dictionary with no documentopen, it will automatically be attached to all new documents.andM;Cursor controls.andP;  Unlike many Mac programs, Quark offers a decent assortmentof keyboard-oriented cursor controls.andP;  The left and right arrow keys can gocharacter-by-character or word-by-word (with the command key) and can jump toeither end of the current line  command plus option keys).andP;  The up and downarrows go by line, by paragraph or to either end of the current story.andP;  Onthe Apple extended keyboard, the page-up, page-down, home and end keys dological things.andP;  If you don't have the extended keyboard, you can emulatethese keys by WordStar-like control keys.andM;Word processor interface.andP;  Xpress 3.0 is shipped with two-way filters forMicrosoft Word 4.0, Microsoft Write, Microsoft Works, WordPerfect, WriteNow2.0, MacWrite 5.0 and MacWrite II, and various forms of tagged text.andP;  Othersmay be provided by third parties in the future.andP;  We think there is a marketfor filters for Pc word processing programs, since many publishers arerunning on 3Com and Novell nets that support both Macs and PCs.andM;CompositionandM;We discussed the relative composition quality offered by Xpress, PageMaker,DesignStudio and Ventura Publisher two months ago (see VoL 4, No.andP;  10).andP;  Asyou may recall, we were not delighted with Xpress's 'standard' wordspacingand letterspacing parameters; in our opinion, the factory defaults permit toomuch letterspacing.andP;  However, you don't have to accept the standardparameters.andM;First, you can edit the factory default so that the 'standard' justificationparameters are to your liking.andP;  Second, you can create any number ofadditional handamp;j parameter sets, give them names and apply them to selectedparagraphs by menu command or through style sheets.andP;  We have often pointedout that the ideal word spacing depends on the column width, font, point sizeand leading, among other things.andP;  Xpress lets you create an handamp;j parameter setfor each of your commonly encountered combinations.andP;  As with other systemsettings, the collection of handamp;j sets will be stored either with a particulardocument or within the Xpress Data file, depending on whether a document isopen when you change the parameter settings.andM;By changing the parameters in various ways, we were able to achieve areasonably close match to the spacing that our normal production systemgives.andP;  However, we had to do this by a cut and try process; the values wehave used successfully with other programs all seemed to space the text tootightly.andP;  We're not sure why this is so, but we doubt that it will be aserious problem for any user.andM;Quality handamp;j.andP;  Quark has written a competent justification algorithm thatbegins with a user-set optimum spaceband and (unlike earlier versions) doesnot letterspace until it has used up all other options.andP;  The algorithmproceeds like this:andM;For each line, Xpress begins by filling the column using the optimum wordspace.andP;  Then it looks forward to the next word break point (which wouldrequire tighter word spacing) and back to the previous break point (looserspacing) and for each case, computes the spacing that would result.andP;  Itchooses the spacing that comes closer to the optimum.andM;If the line cannot be justified with this spacing  perhaps because the userhas set a higher minimum or lower maximum), Xpress tries again withletterspacing enabled.andP;  That is, it tries tightening the line using thespecified minimum value for letterspacing (which might be negative,indicating lettersqueezing) and loosening the line using the maximum valuefor letterspacing.. If one of these works, it will set the fine at thewordspacing limit, then apply letterspacing to make up the remaining space.andO;That is, it uses the minimum amount of letterspacing that will do the job.andM;Note that Xpress treats hyphenation points as equal in merit to word spaces.andO;The program lets you limit the number of hyphenations in a row, but thatsimply has the effect of forbidding hyphenation for the next fine.andM;Normally, the last line of a paragraph is set short.andP;  However, if the lastline of the paragraph falls within a user-specified flush zone, Xpress willspace the line out to the right margin.andP;  Used with discretion, this featurecan avoid lines that look like they were carelessly almost-justified.andM;Rotated text.andP;  Xpress 3.0 can rotate text to any angle, in increments of athousandth of a degree.andP;  The on-screen text rendering is sometimes a bit hardto read (depending on the angle and the size of the type), but it remainsfully editable.andP;  The cursor slants at 45[deg] or flops on its side, and youedit the rotated text in place.andP;  You will probably also flop your headsideways to see what you are doing.andP;  Other programs straighten up the textfor editing, then rotate it back.andP;  Quark has elected to maintain a pureWYSIWYG approach to editing.andM;Old algorithms.andM;The improved justification algorithm could cause problems for users who mustreissue old documents.andP;  For this reason, Xpress 3.0 still has all the oldalgorithms; they come into play only when you open a old document.andM;Ragged setting.andP;  Xpress justifies all ragged paragraphs using the optimumword spacing.andP;  As with justified copy, the program considers hyphenationpoints and word spaces equally (unless hyphenation is prevented for onereason or another).andP;  However, you can set up a hyphenation zone to provideadditional control over the frequency of hyphenation.andP;  On any given line, ifthe next-to-last word ends outside of the zone and the last word has a legalhyphenation point inside the zone, the word can be hyphenated.andP;  Otherwise theline will be set short.andP;  By judicious choice of the zone's size, you canimprove the overall randomness of line endings.andM;Drop caps.andP;  It used to be a multistep process to create a dropped initialletter: figure the size, position the initial in its own text container soyou could move it around, then put a blank container behind it to control thedistance the rest of the text could approach.andP;  Or you could use an externalapplication like Broderbund's TypeStyler to turn your initial into a graphic,as long as you were pretty sure you wouldn't need to edit that text.andM;It's a lot easier in Xpress 3.0: just specify the number of lines to drop andthe number of characters to affect.andP;  Quark does the rest, and the textremains fully editable and moves as part of the paragraph.andM;Small caps.andP;  The very best typography calls for SMALL CAPS to be set with aseparate font of characters designed to be small capitals.andP;  Alas, there arefew PostScript font families that include a small-caps member, let aloneitalic and bold small caps.andP;  (Adobe seems to be alone in offering a few suchextended families.) It is usually necessary to synthesize a small capital byshrinking a regular capital letter.andP;  Unfortunately, this shrinks all finethicknesses as well as the type height and width, making the character lookanemic.andP;  We can partly compensate for this by making the character wider inproportion to its height--an effect PostScript printers achieve with ease,but few programs support.andM;Xpress 3.0 supports independent scaling of the height and width of smallcaps.andP;  This is controlled by a single &quot;preferences&quot; setting that applies tothe entire document.andP;  We experimented and decided that, for our Galliard bodytext, we prefer a small cap height of about 70% of the full cap height, butwe like the width to be about 75%.andM;Ideally, we'd like to set height and width percentages separately for eachstyle sheet.andP;  Xpress doesn't offer that (nor does any other Mac program).andO;What you do get with Xpress is the ability to set the height (in points) andwidth (as a percentage of height) independently for any text in the document.andM;You can also set global values for subscript and superscript sizing (again,separate controls for horizontal and vertical scaling) and verticalpositioning.andP;  Xpress is not a math-typesetting program, but this flexibilityis very useful for simple in-line equations and chemical formulas.andP;  It isnot, however, much help for making fractions.andP;  That is still a manual,multistep process.andP;  Indent here.andP;  One of the functions that code-drivencomposition programs always have is an &quot;indent to here' command.andP;  Its purposeis to let the size of a hanging indent depend on the width of a specific bitof text.andP;  Until now, no desktop programs has offered this feature.andM;Xpress 3.0 does.andP;  You type a command-backslash, which embeds a zero-widthcharacter in the text (so you can remove it by editing) to mark the positionat which subsequent lines will be indented.andP;  The indent expires at the end ofthe current paragraph.andP;  The only drawbacks we can see are that there is nogood way to cancel such an indent before the end of the paragraph or continueit past the current paragraph, and there is no way to type or edit the codein your word processor.andP;  Horrors! Codes! Admittedly, making you type amystery character to achieve a typographic effect seems opposed to the entireWYSWYG philosophy.andP;  We submit that Microsoft Word started it all by inventinga line-break character: a code that ends the current fine (force-justifyingit) but does not cause a paragraph indent on the next line.andP;  We also submitthat special codes are a natural way, even in a WYSIWYG system, to placetext-dependent information into a file.andP;  Full-time operators will have notrouble learning Quark's codes; they are reasonably logical.andP;  Occasionalusers, however, will wish for a menu and will have to settle for a crib sheettaped to the monitor; the online help takes longer than we like for this sortof thing.andM;Quark has a fair number of codes and special characters.andP;  Variouscombinations of the return and enter keys with the shift and command keyswill force a line break, paragraph break, column break, or a jump to the nextlinked container.andP;  There are also:andM;* Dashes.andP;  Everybody gives you the normal (hard) hyphen, the discretionaryhyphen that only appears if the word is breaking at the end of a line, andthe Mac's standard en-dash (-) and em-dash (-).andP;  Quark adds the ability todesignate whether or not the standard hyphen and the two dashes are allowedto break a line.andP;  You enter a non-breaking dash by holding down the commandkey along with the usual keyboard code for that character.andM;*  Spaces.andP;  Similarly, most programs have fixed-width spaces.andP;  (An em-spaceis the width of a capital M, the en-space is the width of a lowercase n, afigure space is the width of a numeral, and a thin space is the width of aperiod.) Quark offers the en-space, a half-en-space and a thin space.andP;  Allthe space codes are treated as line-breaking characters.andP;  You can make themnon-breaking by typing them with the command key down.andM;Note that there is no em-space; Quark used up all the logical keycombinations on the other spaces.andP;  But since an em is twice the width of anen in most fonts, its lack is not devastating.andP;  Furthermore, thehalf-en-space mentioned above is really a  programmable fixed space'; Quarkplans to offer an Xtension that will let you set its value to an em oranything else.andP;  Apparently this feature has been much requested in Europe.andM;Font changes.andP;  Often, you need just one character from a pi font (Symbol,Zapf Dingbats) over and over again.andP;  We use the multiplication-X  x) sign alot to specify printer resolutions and screen dimensions, for example.andP;  Quarkgives you a shortcut: press command-shift-Q and the next character you typewill come from the Symbol font; command-shift-Z gets you one Zapf Dingbat.andM;Loose lines.andP;  The basic Xpress package does not have a means of showing youwhere there are loose lines (those on which the interword space has exceededthe maximum that was set in the handamp;j dialog), but one of the Xtensions in theoptional Quark Xtras package will do exactly that.andM;Tabular matter.andP;  We were disappointed that Xpress has no provision forcomplex tables.andP;  The built-in tab structure is unchanged from earlierreleases.andP;  It offers basic word-processing functionality: each paragraph canhave its own tab rack with up to 20 tab stops.andP;  Each tab stop can align textto the left, right, or center or on a decimal point.andP;  You can associate asingle fill character with each tab stop.andP;  (You can have a dot leader, butnot a dot-dash leader since that would require two fill characters.) The tabrack also sets left and right margins and a first-line indent for theparagraph.andM;We understand that a French firm is developing an Xtension that will providetable editing.andP;  Until it hits the market, anyone contemplating much work withtables would be well advised to use a supplemental program like MacCreations'Tycho.andP;  For that matter, PageMaker's outboard table editing utility willwork.andP;  Both create a PICT graphic that can be imported, but there are limitson how much colorizing and text enhancement you can do.andP;  (Similarly, youcould use Icom's Formulator to create equations as graphics.) In thisrespect, long-document programs like Ventura Publisher, Interleaf Publisherand FrameMaker are better choices than Xpress, PageMaker or DesignStudio.andM;Tracking.andP;  Xpress comes with an Xtension for creating and editing internalkerning and tracking tables.andP;  True tracking, to a professional typographer,is an automatic relation of intercharacter spacing to font and point size.andO;It compensates for an optical illusion that makes large type appear moreloosely spaced than it is.andP;  Xpress has this feature, accessible under theUtilities menu.andP;  For each font installed in your system, you can graphicallyset the tracking relation over the range from two points to 250 points.andP;  Youcan tighten or loosen spacing in increments of 1/200 of an em.andM;For each font, there is only one tracking graph.andP;  For many purposes, thatwill be sufficient.andP;  (It's a big improvement over no tracking function.)andO;However, both PageMaker and DesignStudio offer multiple tracks.andP;  We are mostimpressed by DesignStudio's approach, which gives the user full graphicalcontrol over three tracks, which can then be selected and applied through thestyle sheets.andM;Note that the word 'tracking&quot; seems to mean two different things in Xpress.andO;In addition to the automatic size-dependent relation we just described, youcan select a range of text and tighten or loosen the intercharacter spacingby a specific amount for all characters in the range, using the Track commandfrom the Style menu.andP;  This is a powerful feature, handy for headlines anddisplay ads and sometimes for helping copy fit a given space, but it is nottrue tracking.andP;  We would call this function  local white-space reduction.&quot;andO;Graphics Xpress has no tools for creating graphics (aside from rules andpicture frames), so it must import them from other applications.andP;  Nor does ithave any tools for editing graphics, although it can crop, scale and rotatethem and can adjust the contrast of contones.andM;Incidentally, Xpress can rotate the contents of a picture containerindependently of the rotation of the container.andP;  You might want a 45[deg]diamond-shaped graphic container with rounded corners; at the same time, theimage you plan to put into the container may turn out to have been scannedsideways and will need a 90[deg] rotation.andP;  Xpress can also apply a skew(shear distortion) to a picture.andM;The program can import standard Macintosh graphic file formats:MacPaint-style bitmaps, PICT vector graphics, monochrome and colorEncapsulated PostScript (EPS) files, and TIFF and RIFF images.andP;  The bitmapsand PICT graphics are copied into the document, but EPS, RIFF and TIFF filesare often quite large, so Quark imports only a screen representation of theimage.andP;  It merely remembers the file name of the original image, which itwill copy to the output data stream when it needs to print the page.andM;This approach has two consequences:andM;If you edit the graphic, Xpress will send the new version to the printer,even though it will continue to show the old screen representation.andP;  Forminor changes like color correction this should pose no problem, but moresubstantial editing may mean the screen view is seriously out of date.andO;Fortunately, Quark puts up a warning if it is about to do this, and it givesyou the opportunity to re-import the picture, thus updating the screen.andM;If you rename the graphic file after you import it, Xpress will not be ableto find it.andP;  The same thing will happen if you move the file into a differentfolder.andM;Auto import.andP;  One defense against out-of-date pictures is an auto-importfeature.andP;  If this is turned on (through the Preferences dialog), Xpressexamines the pictures whenever you open a document.andP;  If any changes aredetected (based on the file's date stamp), Xpress will re-import the picture.andO;A further option is for Xpress to warn you whenever it re-imports a picture;you may want to reexamine your cropping decision or readjust the contrastcurves.andM;Picture usage.andP;  A further defense is a listing of all the pictures usedanywhere in the document.andP;  The listing shows the file's full path name, thetype of file and whether it is up to date.andP;  If a file is not where it used tobe, Xpress lets you hunt for it.andP;  Oddly enough, although the Get Picturecommand that originally imports the image has a preview feature, there is nopreview when you go to hunt for it later.andP;  A preview would behandy--specially if someone had renamed the file and you had to guess whatthe new name was.andM;Irregular container.andP;  Xpress offers a variety of picture container shapes:rectangles, octagons, ovals, round-corner rectangles and concave-round-cornerrectangles.andP;  The latest addition to the lineup is the irregular polygon.andP;  Youcreate this container by drawing it freehand with the mouse, moving fromvertex to vertex and double-clicking to close the figure.andP;  You can make upstarbursts and other display-ad cliches easily enough, although it is toughto make a perfect, regular pentagon or hexagon.andP;  Fortunately, you don't haveto get it right on the first pass; a Reshape command lets you reposition,remove or insert vertices at will.andM;Note that the irregular polygon gives you additional  flexibility inconstructing  text runarounds.andP;  Express has long had the ability to let text&quot;creep into' the white space in a graphic container, automatically standingoff from the image by a settable distance.andP;  But if you want to control therunaround shape manually, PageMaker-style, you can now do it by reshaping apolygon to suit your desire.andM;Publication designandM;We have already described the page arrangement functions that Xpress 3.0offers.andP;  The abilities to reorder pages, to move objects from page to pageand to move pages between documents are all welcome improvements to a programwhose strength has long been in the area of publication design.andP;  The libraryfeature is also important in this respect.andP;  Pasteboard.andP;  Xpress now offers apasteboard, an area surrounding the printable page where you can placeobjects that you aren't sure what to do with just yet.andP;  Aldus invented theconcept; in Xpress 3.0, Quark has decided that it can't beat that idea, so ithas adopted it.andP;  Coupled with the new freedom to move objects off the page onwhich they were originally created, this provides a natural way to letartwork bleed off the page.andM;Master pages.andP;  The concept of a master page, containing the constant designfeatures of the publication, is quite powerful; it is the visual equivalentof a style sheet for text.andP;  In previous incarnations, Xpress didn't quite getit right: there were left and right model pages whose elements were copiedonto each document page as it was created.andP;  Unfortunately, changes made tothe model pages after the document pages had been created had no effect onthose pages.andP;  You had to perfect the model before beginning the document-butsince an Xpress document must always have at least one page, that meant thatat least one page was sure to need manual updating after you had completedthe master page design.andM;In version 3, Quark got it right.andP;  You can create up to 127 master pages,including both single-sided and facing-page spreads.andP;  You can put anythingyou like on a master page-text, images, rules-just as you can on a documentpage.andP;  When you apply the master to a document page (by dragging the master'sicon onto the page icon in the document layout windoid), the contents of themaster are copied to that page.andP;  The objects that are copied retain a link tothe master, so that any changes made on the master page automatically updatethe related document pages.andM;You can, if you choose, modify some of the objects that are copied; you mightdo this to make an exception to the basic page design.andP;  The objects that aremodified lose their link to the master, so they will not be updated when youedit the master.andM;You can also apply a different master page at some later time.andP;  Quark letsyou choose (via the Preferences dialog) whether applying a new master willcause the objects from the old master to be crased.andP;  That is, you can designa set of complete, mutually exclusive master pages, or you can design mastercomponents to be combined in various ways.andP;  Align objects.andP;  As noted earlier,you can select several objects and operate on them together.andP;  One of theoperations is to space the objects evenly according to some criterion.andO;Xpress lets you put a specific amount of space between the objects orapportion the total existing space equally.andP;  It also lets you select whetherto align the objects on their centers or edges.andM;PaginationandM;Quark Xpress has never pretended to be a tool for long documents, althoughits spec sheet says that it can cope with documents up to 2,000 pages long.andO;A true long document program has facilities for building tables of contents,indexes and cross-references; it has page and section numbering acrossmultiple files; it offers column balancing and straddle heads and so forth.andO;Xpress has none of these features.andP;  Nonetheless, over time it has picked up afew of what are considered 'long document' features: the ones that offer realconvenience even in short pieces.andP;  Version 2 had style sheets and two-wayfilters for tagged text files.andP;  Version 3 adds stir more.andM;Baseline grid.andP;  Xpress provides an invisible grid to which the baselines oftext can be locked.andP;  Its starting position relative to the top of paper andits line-to-line spacing are settable  presumably to match the leading ofyour body text style) and apply to the entire document.andP;  You can thenspecify, on a paragraph-by-paragraph basis, whether a given piece of textwill lock onto the grid.andM;In this article, we elected to set up a grid with 11-point spacing.andP;  Some ofthe styles we put into our style sheet-for body copy, leadin heads, bulletedlists, etc.-were locked to this grid.andP;  Others--captions, pull quotes, sectionheads-were not locked because their spacing docs not work out to a multipleof 11 points.andM;In each text container, you can require that the first baseline be offsetfrom the top of the container by a settable amount.andP;  You can further specifythat the first baseline be offset by at least enough to clear the top of theletters (choice of font ascent, cap height or cap height plus accent).andP;  Whatthis does is force the text to skip some number of grid lines, depending onthe font and size of text on the first line, whether the first line hasaccented capital letters and the position of the top of the containerrelative to the grid.andM;Widow/orphan control.andP;  Two properties of each paragraph (and thus of anystyle sheets you create) are used to control page and column breaks.andO;Headlines will typically have the &quot;keep with next paragraph&quot; flag asserted.andO;Most other text styles will have the  keep lines together' property turnedon; you can simply forbid breaking any paragraph, or you can specify aminimum number of lines before and after the break to prevent widows andorphans.andM;Paragraph rules.andP;  Another property lets you put rules above or below aparagraph.andP;  You can specify the length of the rule, making it relative to thecolumn width or to the width of the text itself.andP;  You can position the ruleup or down from the text as a percentage of the interparagraph spacing.andP;  Youcan also set the width of the rule, the drawing style--single or multipleline, dotted or dashed line, scotch rule-and the color.andM;These rules will then  float&quot; with the text.andP;  We might use this feature inour Latest Word section to construct the rules over each story headline.andP;  Itwould be a bit clunky, since our rules are of unequal length (forming a&quot;hanging blob&quot;), but we experimented and found that we could combine twoparagraph styles to achieve the effect.andP;  Incidentally, note that unlikeVentura Publisher, Xpress cannot put rules along the sides of the text norapply a box around the paragraph.andM;Anchored graphics.andP;  Another long-document feature is the anchoredillustration.andP;  Xpress  joining the ranks of all good word processors) letsyou treat a graphic element as a kind of text object, so that the graphicwill float&quot; with the text during the editing process.andP;  This is especiallyuseful for a decorative raised initial (you know, the kind with vines andcherubim twirling around the letter) and text that has been styled withTypeStyler, Adobe TypeAlign, LetraStudio and similar tools.andM;Alas, you cannot embed a rule as an anchored graphic, nor can you anchor agroup of pictures.andM;We should point out that, useful as an anchored graphic may be, it is not thesame as a  floating illustration&quot; capability.andP;  The latter feature assuresthat a picture will always be placed on the same page as its anchor (or atleast as close as possible) and lets you position the picture in i preferredlocation, such as the top right comer.andP;  A good tech-doc publishing systemwill also deal with multiple pictures contending for the same preferred spaceon a page and other conflicts.andM;VJ.andP;  Sometimes your text does not fill the assigned space, yet you wish toalter neither the space nor the amount of text.andP;  Earlier versions of Xpresssimply left the excess space at the bottom of the text container.andP;  Version3.0 gives you three more options: excess at the top (bottom-align the text),excess split between top and bottom (center align), and excess inserteduniformly between all lines (vertically justifying the text).andP;  The lasttechnique, vertical justification, is often used by newspapers to makemulticolumn stories come out even.andM;Xpress has a rudimentary vertical justification function.andP;  It is invoked on acontainer-wide basis and (with one exception, below) operates only on therightmost column of a multicolumn container.andP;  It first places excess spaceuniformly between all paragraphs, up to a specified limit.andP;  Any remainingspace is distributed uniformly among all fines in the column.andM;The exception to this rule occurs when widow/orphan control is turned on.andP;  Inthat case, Xpress will vertically justify each column by the minimum amountto obey the keep-lines-together rules.andP;  When it gets to the last column,however, it pulls out all the stops.andM;The Xpress VJ approach works tolerably well for many documents, but it canproduce some really ugly results at times.andP;  We would prefer to see the amountof VJ spacing set as part of the paragraph format so that it could in turn beset by the style sheets.andP;  We also think there should be a priority order forapplying the spacing.andP;  A designer could then specify that the justificationprocedure would put the excess space first around any illustrations ortables, then around section heads and paragraphs with drop caps, then aroundlesser headlines and so on down a hierarchy.andP;  In addition, it should bepossible to apply the same VJ spacing to all columns in a container ratherthan just the last column.andM;ColorandM;One of the biggest reasons Xpress has found favor among artists and designersis its support of color.andP;  In version 3.0, this support has been enhanced toprovide trapping and a limited amount of color correction.andM;Spot color.andP;  Xpress has long provided built-in spot color functionality,allowing you to color any text and to apply color background tints tocontainers.andP;  The program comes with eight predefined colors (which can beedited) and you can define a new color at any time.andP;  You can specify colorsvia the RGB, HSB or CYMK models.andP;  In addition, you can specify any Pantonecolor chip for your new color.andP;  The screen representation may not match theswatch book exactly (due to monitor mis-calibration or to the inherentdifference between a luminous screen and a reflective sheet) but it will beclose enough that you can get a feel for how different Pantone color numbersare related to each other.andP;  Finally, you can import color definitions fromother Xpress documents.andM;One of the colors is called the &quot;registration color.' Regardless of whatcolor you set it to, it will print on every separation plate.andP;  It is used ifyou wish to place your own custom registration marks on a document.andM;Process color.andP;  Xpress does not perform process color separation of scannedimages.andP;  (However, someone might produce an Xtension that docs.) It docs,however, provide a certain amount of support for process color work.andM;First, you can do global color corrections to a color TIFF image, setting thecontrast curve for each of the image's color components.andP;  As with spot color,you can work with CMYK, RGB or HSB color models.andP;  This means that you canimport two images side by side-shot under different lighting conditions,scanned on different scanners-and minimize the differences in picturequality.andP;  You can also perform extreme changes to the picture: posterize orinvert some of the color planes, etc.andM;This is particularly useful for the designer who plans to output the colorseps on a high-end prepress system like Scitex VIP.andP;  Quark supports the DCS(Desktop Color Separation) scheme for linking images on an Xpress page withtheir high-res counterparts in a prepress system.andP;  The linkage informationincludes a description of modifications done to the image, so if you haveobtained some unusual effect on your Mac, the prepress system should be ableto replicate it automatically.andM;Second, you can import an image that was separated in another program andsaved as an EPS file.andP;  Xpress will not let you adjust its color, however.andM;Trapping.andP;  When you print one solid color over another, Xpress knocks out thebackground color under the foreground object.andP;  The advantage is theforeground color prints with higher purity and brightness.andP;  The disadvantageis that if there is any error in press registration of the different colors,a bit of white paper may show through.andP;  To prevent this, Xpress will spreadthe foreground color (making it slightly larger) or choke the backgroundcolor (removing all but a thin amount near the object's border) on the theorythat a bit of overprinting is much less obnoxious than a white sliver showingthrough.andM;Xpress has an automatic trapping algorithm that bases its decisions on therelative percentage of black (using the CYMK model) in the foreground andbackground colors.andP;  For special cases, you can set the amount of trappingmanually: for each foreground color in your document, you can set the chokeor spread to be applied on each background color.andM;XtensionsandM;Good as it is, Xpress cannot be all things to all publishers.andP;  There willalways be applications that are too specialized and niches that are too smallfor Quark to address.andP;  With this in mind, Quark has provided third-partyprogrammers with a mechanism for adding their own functions to Xpress's basicfeature set.andP;  These add-in modules are called Xtensions.andP;  Quark says thatmore than 100 developers are actively marketing or very close to completingXtensions.andP;  Some of them have already been mentioned; others have yet to beannounced.andM;From a programmer's point of view, an Xtension is essentially a devicedriver-a piece of code that is called on to execute specific functions whenthe user asks for them.andP;  The Xtension can in turn call on several hundredinternal Xpress routines and data structures, so the third-party developerdoesn't have to reinvent the equivalent of a Quark Xpress program on his own.andM;Xtensions have largely been responsible for Quark's overwhelming success inthe newspaper and magazine industry.andP;  Software Consulting Services, forexample, wrote an Xtension to link the output of its display ad positioningprogram, Layout 8000, thus turning Xpress into an ad pagination program.andP;  Inanother example, North Atlantic Publishing Systems has developed CopyFlow,which lets you name text containers on the page and associate them withspecific files, import the files in a batch, send selected files out toeditors for revision, and purge the text so you can reuse the document forthe next edition.andP;  (For more examples, see The Seybold Report on PublishingSystems, Vol.andP;  19, No.andP;  21.)andM;Quark ships some Xtensions of its own with the basic Xpress package: the wordprocessor file import/export filters and the kerning/tracking editor.andP;  Itoffers a supplemental package, called Quark Xtras, to provide severaladditional functions, including a loose-line detector, a printer calibrationtest suite, support for Apple and Howtek scanners and for theAdobe-recommended screen angle/screen frequency combinations.andP;  We understandthat customers mill also receive a package of freeware Xtensions when theysend in their registration cards.andM;ConclusionsandM;Nearly all of the features we have examined have been oriented toward thedesigner of a new publication.andP;  For magazines, newspapers and otherlayout-driven publications, as well as for free-form design of one-offbrochures and advertisements, Xpress has few peers.andM;Xpress has relatively little to offer a document production shop that mustput out hundreds of structured, standardized pages each week.andP;  For thoseusers, we recommend Interleaf Publisher (which runs on Macs and PCs as wellas Unix workstations) or Ventura Publisher  which now runs only on PCs but isdue to arrive in the Mac world this fall).andP;  FrameMaker (on Macs and Unixworkstations) is another candidate.andP;  We shall have more to say about thesethree programs later this year.andM;As we have noted in this article, Xpress 3.0 meets (and in some areas sets)the current desktop standards for composition quality, graphics handling,document design and color.andP;  It falls short of real-world needs in just onearea: multiuser functionality.andM;Networks.andP;  The biggest difference between desktop publishing programs anddedicated, high-end systems is in the area of network support and multiuserfunctionality.andP;  Xpress 3.0 has just one feature-picture usage-that is gearedtoward group activity.andP;  Aside from that, it has no support for networks.andM;We don't mean to imply that Xpress cannot handle large publications.andP;  In TheSeybold Report on Publishing Systems (VoL 19, No.andP;  20), we described how LeDroit, a Montreal daily of 64 pages, gets the paper out with Xpress, someXtensions, some custom software and lots of careful attention to procedures.andM;We expect that future versions of all the major desktop products will beoriented toward system-wide coordination.andP;  It is evident that Xpress 3.0contains at least some network-aware code now: whenever a copy of Xpress islaunched, it broadcasts its serial number over any network the workstation isattached to.andP;  At the moment, this merely inhibits software piracy, since if acopy of Xpress hears its own serial number coming from elsewhere on the net,it gives an error message and stops running.andP;  But it points to amessage-passing mechanism that could form the basis for a very interestingpublishing system.andP;  Quark, by the way, declined to comment on what any futureproduct might look like.andM;Preferred.andP;  In the mean time, Xpress win continue to provide the preferreddesktop publishing program for artists and graphic designer, as well as apagination engine for magazines and-newspapers (thanks to Xtensions fromthird parties).andP;  It Vill still have a hard time matching PageMaker's salesfigures, but it will be able to penetrate niches that PageMaker cannot, andwill continue to hold a core of loyal users.andM;An Overview of Quark Xpress 3.0andM;Xpress is a pure layout-driven publishing program.andP;  It shines in designexperimentation and the creation of display ads, flyers, book jackets and soon.andP;  It has become the desktop program of choice for magazine production.andP;  Ithas few features for repetitive production of long, structured documents.andO;Hardware.andP;  Macintosh with at least 2 MB Of RAM and hard disk.andP;  RequiresSystem 6-level operating system; System 6.0.5 recommended.andP;  Color monitorpreferred, since color handling is a major Xpress attraction.andM;Output.andP;  PostScript is presumed, but matrix printers supported for drafts.andO;Specific support for high-res imagesetters.andP;  Spot and process color supportincludes trapping.andP;  Xpress does not perform image editing or processseparation of color halftones, but can adjust contrast curves for RGB, HSB orCYMK components.andM;User interface.andP;  Allows up to seven open documents.andP;  Screen views at anyscale from 10% to 400%; menu choices are fit-in-window, 50%, 100%, 200%.andO;Magnifying-glass tool jumps up or down in settable increments.andP;  Thumbnailsview and page-arrangement windoid allow reordering pages, moving pagesbetween documents.andM;Unlike former versions, objects in Xpress 3.0 have no inherent parent-childrelationships.andP;  Objects can be moved freely from page to page; can sprawlacross page spreads.andP;  A pasteboard surrounds all pages, supporting full bleeddesigns and holding objects for later use.andP;  Library files support namedobject collections.andM;Horizontal and vertical rulers (set independently) in inches, inches decimal,centimeters, millimeters, picas, points, ciceros.andP;  Nonprinting guidelineswith snap-to function.andP;  A measurements windoid shows and sets containerdimensions, rotation angle, type specs, etc.andP;  All measurements (in dialogs,property sheets, windoids) allow three-decimal-place precision (e.g., to .001point).andM;Authoring, editing.andP;  Good spelling checker works with individual stories(chains of linked text blocks) or entire document; has updatable userdictionary.andP;  Search/replace can be case-, font-, size- and style-specific.andO;Two-way filters (Xtensions) for word processor file formats: MS Word 3.0 and4.0, MS Write, MS Works, WriteNow 2.0, MacWrite 5.0 and 11.andM;Composition.andP;  Good justification algorithm employs user-set optimumwordspacing with minimum/maximum space controls.andP;  Letterspacing (positive andnegative) only when word space limits reached.andP;  Auto kerning by font tablesin Xpress Data file or by system font info; auto tracking by font, setgraphically but limited to a single track.andP;  Hyphenation is based on80,000-word dictionary, user dictionary and logic.andP;  You can limit the numberof hyphenated lines in a row, set minimum letters before and after a hyphen.andO;Hyphenation-zone control for ragged setting.andM;Xpress supports multiple handamp;j parameter sets (hyphenation controls,wordspacing, character spacing, flush zone and hyphenation zone) that can beapplied in style sheets or independently to each paragraph.andM;Runarounds are automatic.andP;  All text and graphic containers repel text to asettable standoff distance (unless this property is suppressed).andP;  Bitmap andline graphics can optionally allow text to enter their container, repellingit only from the black image area.andP;  Manual runarounds are supported with theirregular polygon.andM;Graphics.andP;  Can draw rules with settable thickness, end arrows, dotted ordashed line styles.andP;  Boxes and ovals are done with decorative frames aroundcontainers; frame takes the shape of the container.andP;  A separate program, theFrame Editor, allows creation of new frame designs, which are 72-dpi bitmapsrather than scalable vectors, unfortunately Imports monochrome and color EPS,PICT and TIFF graphics, as well as MacPaint and image Studio RIFF formats.andO;Graphics are linked by name rather than copied into the document; programchecks timestamps and warns you if the image source file has been alteredafter you imported it, giving you a chance to re-link or update it.andM;Pagination.andP;  Linked chains of rectangular text containers control flow oftext across pages.andP;  Auto creation of new pages upon import of text files;auto &quot;continued on&quot; lines.andP;  Up to 127 master pages (single-sided or facingpage pairs) allow headers, footers, page numbers, logos and other repeatingelements.andP;  Except where objects derived from a master page have beenmodified, changes to a master page will retroactively update the relateddocument pages.andP;  Applying a different master can replace objects derived fromearlier masters or add to them.andM;Xtensions.andP;  Third-party add-on modules are available to perform specificfunctions not included in the base package: Pc word processor filters, linksto ad-layout databases, crossword puzzle generators, etc.andP;  Quark offersseveral Xtensions of its own, called Xtras: loose-line detector, printercalibration, Adobe screen angles, scanner support, etc.andP;  Marketing.andP;  Xpressis priced at $795; the Xtras package is $79.95.andP;  A volume purchase plan isavailable if you buy five copies or more.andP;  Customers who send in theirregistration cards (a disk, actually) will receive a &quot;goodies package&quot; thatincludes one Bitstream font, a laminated reference card (keyboard crib sheet)and a disk of sample patterns, icons nd libraries.andP;  An Extended Warranty($195) gets you a year free phone support and all upgrades during that time.andM;1 The official name of the program is QuarkXPress[R].andP;  It is widely known asXpress, however.andP;  As is our custom, we will capitalize only the initialletter of that name.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
