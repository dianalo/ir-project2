Net income for Exxon Corp. rose 4% while Mobil Corp.'s jumped 60%. Amoco Corp.'s profit more than doubled as Atlantic Richfield Co.'s rose by 21%, Occidental Petroleum Corp.'s by almost 31% and Unocal Corp.'s by 3.4%. All were generally in line with analysts' expectations.    Operating profit at Exxon, the nation's largest oil company, rose by a much higher percentage, but the absence of special gains to match those of a year earlier eroded that percentage. Rich in cash, Exxon also said it had purchased 49 million shares of its own stock for $2.1 billion in the first half, an average of $42.85 a share. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, the shares closed at $45.375, up 87.5 cents.    The surge in second-quarter profit came about despite lower oil prices. The companies reporting results yesterday generally said that their earnings from exploration and production, or &quot;upstream&quot; operations, fell, but that these declines were more than offset by increased profit from the &quot;downstream&quot; business of refining and marketing chemicals, gasoline and other products.    The strong showing in the face of falling crude oil prices &quot;proves the value of integration,&quot; said William Brown III, oil analyst for Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. &quot;Declines from the weaker upstream operations are counterbalanced by gains from the downstream and chemical businesses.&quot;    Mr. Brown said that he expects oil companies to perform strongly through the remainder of this year, despite further possible weakening of crude oil prices. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is expected to continue producing beyond its quota for as long as refiners continue to buy the cartel's low-priced crude. Strong demand in the U.S. and Europe in recent months has propped up the price of gasoline and has caused refiners to load up on crude.    &quot;A year ago, rising crude-supply costs and soft product prices squeezed margins for refined products,&quot; explained Exxon's chairman, Lawrence Rawl, in a statement. &quot;In the most recent quarter, margins were stronger, as supply costs dropped and product prices firmed.&quot;    While earnings from Exxon's exploration and production sector slipped $183 million to $703 million, still a hefty profit, gains from its refining and marketing business rose $262 million to $281 million, wiping out that decline.    Strong demand for petrochemicals -- the result of demand for plastics in the U.S. and overseas -- also helped to prop up earnings. For example, Mobil's chemical business posted its best quarter ever with a profit of $160 million, more than double a year earlier.    For 1988, Occidental said that lower oil prices and the net cost of as much as $22 million resulting from the recent North Sea oil-platform disaster could be more than offset by gains in the company's chemical business. Occidental predicted that, partly as a result of its Cain Chemical Inc. acquisition, 1988 net will climb from year-earlier levels even if oil prices decline further.    Following are the second-quarter results of the major oil companies reporting yesterday:   EXXON: The New York-based giant said second-quarter net totaled $1.2 billion, or 90 cents a share, compared with the year-earlier $1.15 billion, or 81 cents a share. Revenue rose 7% to $21.6 billion from $20.2 billion. The company added that it increased its world-wide capital and exploration spending during the first half by 38% to $3.06 billion, with the bulk of that spending focused on its exploration and production business.    MOBIL: Net rose to $487 million, or $1.18 a share, from the $304 million, or 74 cents a share, a year earlier. The New York-based company, the industry's second-largest in the U.S., said revenue rose to $14.2 billion from $12.3 billion a year earlier. Profit included $35 million in operating earnings from the Montgomery Ward retail subsidiary sold last month.    AMOCO: Special items accounted for some of the huge jump in profit to $667 million, or $2.59 a share, from $311 million, or $1.22 a share, a year earlier. The special gains included $186 million from settlements of natural-gas sales disputes, partly offset by $50 million in charges associated with insurance operations. Excluding such special factors, the Chicago-based company said earnings rose 71%.    ARCO: Profit jumped to $400 million, or $2.19 a share, from $330 million, or $1.80 a share, a year earlier. Revenue edged up to $4.6 billion from $4.1 billion. The Los Angeles company's latest results included a $25 million gain from property sales, while second-quarter 1987 results included a gain of about $30 million from the settlement of natural gas contract disputes.    Lodwrick M. Cook, Arco's chairman, confirmed as part of the earnings announcement the discovery of a &quot;significant&quot; natural gas reservoir in the Wilburton field in Oklahoma. He said that based on four wells drilled to date in the field, recoverable reserves are estimated to be as high as 600 billion cubic feet of natural gas. Arco owns 70% of the field.    OCCIDENTAL: The Los Angeles-based company had net of $77 million, or 34 cents a share, compared with the year-earlier $59 million, or 23 cents a share. Revenue rose to $4.7 billion from $4.3 billion. The latest profit included a loss of $10 million from the early retirement of high-cost debt. Year-earlier results included a gain of $17 million from federal income tax benefits and $81 million from the sale of an oil and gas subsidiary in Colombia. During the second quarter Occidental issued 51.7 million shares of common stock to strengthen its balance sheet.    UNOCAL: Earnings edged up to $64 million, or 55 cents a share. A year earlier, the Los Angeles-based company earned $62 million, or 53 cents a share. Revenue rose to $2.5 billion from $2.4 billion. Unocal's latest results include $19 million in gains from special items; there were no significant nonrecurring items in the year-earlier quarter, a spokeswoman said.    Although lower exploration and production earnings were somewhat offset by the profitable refining and marketing business, Unocal didn't have the benefit, like most other oil companies, of a thriving chemicals business. Unocal's chemicals operations are focused on fertilizers and portions of the petrochemicals business that haven't participated in the boom. </TEXT></DOC>
