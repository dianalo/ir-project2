With thisinvention, the air passage ducts and exhaust air outlets are fitted withan aggregate of hydrophilic fiber which absorbs condensed water so thatcondensed water will not close the air passage. The fiber aggregate maybe made up of any hydrophilic material that withstands cell operatingtemperatures and the electrolyte liquid emitted like a mist. An examplesof organic fiber is phenol bonded fiber; examples of inorganic fiberare glass fiber sheet, SiC bonded fiber, and carbon fiber sheet. (7 figs)</TEXT></DOC>
