The arrests broke one and perhaps two KGB operations, the reportssaid.   ``It could be the biggest counter-espionage operation in Europein recent years,'' said Rome's La Repubblica.   Prosecutors and police confirmed two people were arrested forespionage, but refused to give details, saying the investigation wascontinuing.   The Italian news agency AGI reported Sunday the arrests ended twoseparate KGB operations in Italy.   The reports about the affair, carried by newspapers and thestate-run RAI television, identified those arrested as GiorgioStancich, an electronics technician living in Yugoslavia; andNatalino Francalanci, a fur dealer from Pontedera, near Pisa.   Francalanci, 51, was arrested Feb. 11 in the Ligurian port cityof La Spezia. Stancich, 42, was arrested Thursday near the Adriaticport of Trieste, the reports said.   Newspapers said Francalanci traveled often to Eastern Europe onbusiness. RAI said his arrest was in connection with NATO researchon anti-submarine warfare.   AGI said that Francalanci was linked to an alleged Soviet effortto procure information about the making of fiber optics for industryand the military.   Stancich worked for IRET, a joint Italian-Yugoslavian firm inTrieste that manufactures electronic communications systems forcivilian and military use, the reports said. He commuted to workfrom Skofje, just across the border in Yugoslavia where he lives.   The reports said Stancich was arrested while trying to cross theborder with documents related to a highly advanced electronicwarfare project known as Catrin, said to be one of the mostsophisticated systems of its kind and destined for use by NATO.   The project, still under development, involves computer systemscapable of directing activity on an entire battefield, includingground and air operations, the reports said.   Milan's Corriere Della Sera reported that the operation wascoordinated across the Yugoslav border by KGB agents apparentlyworking without the knowledge of the Yugoslav government. Thenewspaper quoted unidentified sources as identifying one agent as aformer Tass news agency correspondent in Rome.   RAI said the classified information was to have been sent fromYugoslavia to KGB agents in Austria.   AGI said that in the other operation, the KGB was seeking toobtain information on the technology used by Otomelara, a La Speziafirm that makes fiber optics.   It said Italian agents, posing as suppliers of information,discovered that two Italians had been bringing information about thetechnology to the KGB in Vienna.   AGI said the two Italians were Francalanci and another man whohad escaped to another, unidentified country.</TEXT></DOC>
