Plumeria Dr.,andM;San Jose, CA 95134; 800-648-2287, 408-432-1160.andM;List price (tested configuration): $10,843.andM;Memory and processor RAM cache: 8MBandM;80-ns.andP;  SIMMs, 128K cache.andM;Disk drives and controller: Quantum 13.ms.andM;426.5MB SCSI; Mylex controller, 1 MB cache;andM;1.2MB floppy disk drive.andM;Display: American Mitac Super VGA adapter,andM;American Mitac 14-inch monitor.andM;Software: DOS 4.01.andM;The Mitac 4270F, from American Mitac, has the distinction of being the firstEISA system to come through PC Magazine Labs in a small-footprint case.andO;Alas, the combination seems oxymoronic, given that the EISA bus currently hasmore promise for network servers than for desktop systems.andP;  And there aresignificant compromises that come from cramming a full-size board into a 6.3-by 15- by 16.8-inch (HWD) case.andM;American Mitac couldn't supply PC Magazine's standard configuration becausethe smallest drive that the unit ships with is a whopping 426.5MB.andP;  The pricefor the unit's closest match to our standard configuration is $10,843, with8MB RAM, 128K cache, a 426.5MB hard disk, one 1.2MB floppy disk drive, and aVGA subsystem.andP;  Note that the VGA subsystem as tested included a Super VGAboard but was limited by the VGA monitor.andM;Certainly the most obvious compromise of the small-footprint case is ascarcity of drive bays.andP;  The unit offers two accessible half-height bays, oneaccessible 3.5-inch bay, and one internal 3.5-inch bay for a grand total offour bays.andP;  The company makes up for this bay shortage somewhat by supplyingonly high-capacity hard disks, which range from 426.5MB on up to 1.2GB.andP;  Butthe fact remains that having only four bays limits expansion possibilities.andO;Note that the company has no other choices for the case.andM;COMPROMISEandM;Another compromise forced by the physical design is that the inside of thebox is as crowded as a subway during rush hour.andP;  As a measure of just howcrowded that can be, the 4270F has nine expansion slots on themotherboard-including one dedicated 32-bit memory slot-but only six areaccessible.andP;  The power supply covers two slots, and the power cables block athird.andP;  Also note that the coprocessor socket is under the drive bays.andP;  Thatmeans you have to remove the drives to get at the socket, making an upgradeto a Weitek coprocessor time-consuming.andM;Except for memory, all the key motherboard components are on the Mitacmotherboard.andP;  In addition to the 80486 and the Weitek socket, you'll find theIntel chip set, Phoenix BIOS, and 128K of 25-nanosecond processor RAM cache.andO;System memory sits on a proprietary board that plugs into the dedicatedmemory slot.andP;  The board itself has 16 SIMM sockets that can be filled up to64MB using 4MB SIMMs, or up to 16MB with 1MB SIMMS.andP;  Our test system hadeight IMB SIMMs installed.andM;MIXED PERFORMANCEandM;The five accessible expansion slots leave more room for growth than you mightexpect, with three slots still available on our test system.andP;  Most of theempty slots are courtesy of the Mitac multifunction I/O board, which containsVGA video, floppy disk controller, and parallel and serial ports on a singlecard.andP;  The video can give you 800-by-600 resolution, or interlaced1,024-by-768 resolution with additional RAM.andP;  But it also turned insignificantly lower-than-average performance on our video test.andP;  If youchoose to replace the video with a faster or higher-resolution card, you'llbe down to just two slots.andM;The only other card in the test system was a Mylex caching controller with 1MB of cache RAM.andP;  On our DOS File Access tests, this controller, which cansupport up to 16MB of cache, yielded sterling performance in combination withQuantum's 13-millisecond 426.5MB hard disk.andM;Processor speed, as measured by the 80486 instruction mix test, was anotherarea where the unit's performance is clearly excellent, scoring at the highend of the norm.andP;  Unfortunately, the unit's Conventional Memory test resultswere somewhat disappointing.andP;  In a group of systems that showed littledifference in conventional memory performance, the American Mitac unit wasone of the few that actually fell below the norm.andP;  All told, however, itsexcellent disk performance makes up for most other shortcomings.andM;American Mitac's warranty and support policies are a strong plus for thesystem.andP;  The price includes a one-year warranty, complete with on-siteservice supplied by Bell Atlantic.andP;  Toll-free phone support is available from7:30 to 5:30 P.S.T., Monday through Friday.andM;The entire Mitac line is high priced.andP;  The cost of a similarly equipped386/33 ISA system, for example, is $8,360.andP;  More interesting, perhaps, is thecompany's 486/ 33 EISA.andP;  A similarly equipped 486/33 is priced at a hefty$12,843, but that includes a tower case and a 300-watt power supply, puttingit firmly in server territory for both price and physical design.andM;As for the 4270F itself, the small-footprint design seems of questionableworth, especially at $10,843.andP;  There is no denying that you get a poweruser's system in this small-footprint box, but the limits onexpandibility-and EISA's limited value outside of serverdom-make it hard torecommend at this price.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
