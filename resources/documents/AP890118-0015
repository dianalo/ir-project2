(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A semiautomatic rifle such as the AK-47 thatwas used in the Stockton, Calif., school shootings Tuesday can beeasily purchased at Oregon gun stores _ without even the waitingperiod required to buy a handgun.   The gunman, identified by police as Patrick Purdy, had bought therifle from the Sandy Trading Post on Aug. 3, according to SandyPolice Chief Fred Punzel. Authorities say Purdy opened fire in anelementary school yard, killing five youngsters and wounding 30people before killing himself.   Bob Imel, owner of PAWS gun shop in Salem, said there is nowaiting period under Oregon law to buy rifles or shotguns, unlessthey are fully automatic. There is a five-day wait to buy a handgun,while police agencies check for criminal records.   A buyer is required to sign a form issued by the U.S. Bureau ofAlcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. The form requires the buyer toprovide identification and attest that he is not under indictment,has not been convicted of a crime punishable by more than a year inprison and is not a fugitive from justice.   A buyer also must attest that he is not an unlawful user ofnarcotics, has not been found mentally defective or been committedto a mental instutition, has not been discharged dishonorably fromthe armed forces, is not an illegal alien and has not renounced U.S.citizenship.   People must be at least 18 to purchase rifles and shotguns and 21to buy handguns. There are some other requirements, including that aprospective buyer not have been adjudged mentally ill or be anex-convict, Imel said.   Purchases of automatic weapons are more complicated, he said,because federal law requires extensive background checks andregistration of the weapons. The procedure usually takes severalmonths before a buyer can receive the gun, Imel said.   In California, anyone can purchase a semiautomatic weapon bycompleting a form and showing a driver's license or other proof ofresidency in the state.   California Deputy Attorney General Alan Ashby said that even inlegal semiautomatic condition, an AK-47 can fire at a rate of 400rounds per minute, and that conversion to automatic firing, whileillegal, is relatively easy on many semiautomatic models.   Sales of the Soviet-designed AK-47s have become intenselycontroversial in California because of their use by the increasinglyviolent street gangs in Los Angeles and other communities.   In the Los Angeles area, models of the AK-47 that have beenmanufactured in China sell from $299 to $329 at sporting goodsstores, and are often advertised on sale.</TEXT></DOC>
