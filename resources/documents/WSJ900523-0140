Although 43 states prohibit the sale of tobacco to minors,American children between the ages of eight and 18 consume947 million packs of cigarettes and 26 million containers ofsmokeless tobacco each year, according to the survey.</LP><TEXT>   The survey also estimates annual federal and state taxrevenues from tobacco sales to children at $325 million.   The authors of the study -- Joe Tye, president of StopTeenage Addiction to Tobacco, and Joseph DiFranza, anassistant professor at the University of MassachusettsMedical Center -- blame the problem on lax enforcement ofminimum-age laws by local officials and indifference to theproblem on the part of tobacco marketers.   &quot;It really is an enormous business,&quot; said Dr. DiFranza,&quot;In medicine we treat tobacco as an addictive substance, yetan 11-year-old can buy a pack of cigarettes.&quot;   Some critics fear that's happening more frequently.Although unit sales of cigarettes in the U.S. slumped 3% lastyear, one independent study, the Gallup Youth Survey, showsthat the percentage of teenagers aged 13-15 who smoke jumpedto 11% last year from 7% in 1988. At the same time, sales ofmoist snuff, which is popular among teen-age boys, increased4.6%.   Although most states have laws in place that restricttobacco sales to minors, few are enforced, according to theJAMA study. Several small communities, however, have enactedtough new laws, and early results indicate they can beeffective. In Woodridge, Ill., a Chicago suburb, an ordinanceenacted a year ago requires merchants selling tobacco topurchase licenses from the town. Retailers who repeatedlyviolate the ban may lose their license and be fined up to$400.   To test compliance, the Woodridge police departmentregularly sends out 13-year-old &quot;agents&quot; to try to buytobacco from the village's 38 licensed vendors. Last March,three stores lost their licenses for supplying cigarettes.Since then, according to local police officials, no retailershave gotten caught in the sting operations.   Tobacco marketers deny targeting children. The $40 billionindustry steadfastly maintains its ads and promotions aremeant for adults only. &quot;The tobacco industry is diametricallyopposed to kids using tobacco,&quot; said a spokeswoman for theTobacco Institute, an industry trade group.   Manufacturers argue that their customers are wholesalers,rather than consumers, and that they can't always controlretailers' actions. A spokesman for Philip Morris Cos. saidthe company provides retailers with signs that proclaim agelimits, and gives out brochures to instruct store clerksabout tobacco laws.</TEXT></DOC>
