(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>The Ins and Outs of AD/CycleandM;Essential to the advance of knowledge over the last 200 years has been acommon frame of reference and a standardized system of measurement.andP;  Theroots of this go back to France in the mid-1700s, to the compilation of thefirst encyclopedia by Denis Diderot and Jean Le Rond d' Alembert.andM;As Judson Gooding and Alexander Dorozynsk wrote in a recent issue of Forbes,&quot;At the time Diderot assembled his encyclopedia, there were myriad units ofmeasure, varying by country, by region, and even by town.... Thoroughlyannoyed by the whole thing, Diderot wrote that the diversity of measures onefinds in France has always caused frequent disputes.&quot;andM;More than 200 years later, such disputes are still going on in thecomparatively young science of computing.andP;  In the area of computer-aidedsoftware engineering (CASE), for example, there is currently no commonlyagreed upon model of information to govern the use of application developmentproductivity tools--tools such as code generators, fourth-generationlanguages and graphical analysis and design implements.andM;IBM aims to change that with its recent announcement of AD/Cycle.andO;Specifically, it hopes to provide a standardized frame of reference forapplications development.andM;AD/Cycle is a set of plans, interfaces and standards intended to allow theintegration of individual tools into a comprehensive development environment,one that provides definitions for the storage, manipulation and reusabilityof all information relevant to the system-building process.andM;With AD/Cycle, IBM has recognized the value of the pioneering efforts made byother vendors in the CASE marketplace and has not chosen to reverse thatprogress by offering a proprietary, incompatible alternative.andP;  Instead, ithas openly sought the input, cooperation and support of nearly everysignificant player in the industry--vendors, consultants, IBM user groups andkey customers.andM;The AD/Cycle announcement incorporates several new and upgraded IBM products,independent CASE vendors' products, extensions to IBM's umbrella computingenvironment, Systems Application Architecture (SAA) and the fruits of specialrelationships cultivated with independent software vendors and professionalservices firms.andM;The AD/Cycle architectureidentifies development technologies by life cyclephase (see chart, &quot;Where Products Fit Into AD/Cycle&quot;).andP;  The features of eachAD/Cycle tool category, as well as the products that are anticipated tooccupy those categories, are described below.andM;Cross Life Cycle ToolsandM;Cross Life Cycle Tools identify the sequence of tasks, timing, milestones anddeliverables, what is sometimes also referred to as &quot;process management&quot;tools.andP;  In other words, they constitute the system development life cyclemethodology.andP;  These tools are not specific to any particular life cycle phaseand include documentation, project communication and change control/impactanalysis.andM;Historically, process management has been the most ignored life cycle phase,yet is is one of the most vital for automating software development.andP;  Bycontrast, it is a prominent component of the AD/Cycle framework.andP;  For years,software developers have been saying you can't automate what hasn't beenstandardized.andP;  Now the same principle comes home to roost: softwaredevelopers need to standardize their own applications development before theycan automate it.andM;What is particularly noteworthy about the IBM AD/Cycle solution is that IBMis not dictating which standard life cycle methodology customers shouldchoose.andP;  Instead, it has provided a facility that will let customers definetheir own standards.andP;  The bad news is that defining those standards will takea great deal of effort.andP;  The good news is that it simply wouldn't work anyother way.andM;Planning and Design ToolsandM;Early validation of requirements, refinement of busines models andprototyping from those models are all part of the earliest stages ofapplication development under AD/Cycle.andP;  The planning and design stages oflife cycle support have long been considered the source of most defects insystems, yet it is also here that correcting defects is least expensive.andM;Three products support enterprise modeling techniques: IEW/PlanningWorkstation from KnowledgeWare Inc. of Atlanta; PC Prism from IndexTechnology Corp. in Cambridge, Mass.; and IBM's own DevelopMate.andP;  Productsthat address analysis and design are IEW/Analysis Workstation and IEW/DesignWorkstation (KnowledgeWare); Excelerator (Index Technology); and Bachman/DAfrom Bachman Information Systems Inc. of Burlington, Mass.andM;Produce and Build/Test ToolsandM;Produce and Build/Test tools include languages, generators andknowledge-based systems.andM;IBM says AD/Cycle will embrace traditional development languages, and thecompany is committed to enhancing these languages and their editing/debuggingenvironments.andP;  PL/1 is now on the list of SAA languages, which alreadyincludes C, COBOL, FORTRAN, RPG and REXX.andP;  According to IBM, all of these SAAlanguages will be enhanced to provide integrated development functions.andO;Language compilers will be integrated over time with front-end tools; dynamicdebuggers will be more tightly coupled with the edit/compile facilities.andM;IBM's application generator is called the Cross System Product (CSP).andP;  IBMhas enhanced CSP with a facility called External Source Format (ESF).andP;  ESFenables information collected through AD/Cycle analysis and design tools tobe passed to CSP for automatic code generation.andP;  Users will also be able tocombine traditionally produced code with code produced from CSP applicationgeneration.andP;  Already this year, several vendors have announced that they willinterface their products with CSP through ESF: Chicago-based AndersenConsulting; Index Technology; KnowledgeWare; McDonnell Douglas Corp. of St.andO;Louis; Nastec Corp. of Southfield, Mich.; Sage Software Inc. in Rockville,Md.; and Dallas-based Texas Instruments Inc.andM;In many respects, ESF is a short-term, expedient solution to integrate CSPinto the CASE environment.andP;  ESF allows CASE products to interface directly toCSP without having to go through the repository.andP;  We expect that ESF willeventually become redundant as the repository technology matures.andM;IBM is also including expert systems technology within its CASE framework.andO;The company says its existing IBM Expert Systems Environment (ESE) andKnowledge Tool (KT) will converge.andP;  Additionally, Knowledge EngineeringEnvironment (KEE) from Mountain View, Calif.-based IntelliCorp Inc. will beincorporated into AD/Cycle.andM;Testing and MaintenanceandM;Two new tools are included as part of the AD/Cycle announcement for testingand maintenance: Software Analysis Test Tool (SATT) and WorkstationInteractive Test Tool (WITT).andP;  SATT measures and analyzes test coverage forOS PL/1 and VS COBOL II applications.andP;  WITT records and reexecutesinteractive test sessions including regression testing for all SAAenvironments.andM;IBM's COBOL restructuring facility, COBOL/SF, will support conversion from VSCOBOL to VS COBOL II and restructuring of existing COBOL productionapplications.andP;  CCCA, IBM's COBOL and CICS/VS command-level conversion aid,will convert old macro-level CICS programs to the newer command-levelinterface.andM;Methodology ImplicationsandM;Methodology is a complex subject.andP;  The term has been used and abused in manydifferent ways.andP;  It rightfully includes methods that embody what strategywill be used for applications development (top down, bottom up, data driven,business driven, etc.); the techniques to implement the methods(entity-relationship modeling, data flow diagramming, prototyping) and thework breakdown structure that imposes discipline on how the methods areapplied (life-cycle task definitions, milestone criteria, estimatingguidelines).andM;CASE tools can help take the tedium out of the application of rigorous,engineering-like methodologies.andP;  In theory, AD/Cycle is methodologyindependent in that it supports any number of strategies, techniques and workbreakdown structures.andM;However, the CASE tools that will initially be available will probably bringwith them their own particular biases and limitations regarding methods.andO;Even AD/Cycle's as-yet-undefined, core Application Development InformationModel will probably have its own methodological implications.andP;  For example,the fact that AD/Cycle's life cycle model begins with enterprise modelinggives it a flavor of information engineering.andM;Although its methodology implications will become clearer over time, AD/Cycleshould always allow customers to define their methodology within thelimitations of the particular tool sets chosen.andP;  It should enforce andstandardize the use of that methodology, while allowing for it to evolve overtime, as tools and methods mature and as the organization's requirementschange.andM;What Users Need To DoandM;Announced last September, but not entirely available for as long as twoyears, AD/Cycle is currently more vision and intent than immediatelyavailable technology.andP;  What should customers be doing as they wait forAD/Cycle to become clear?andM;IBM, of course, is recommending that customers prepare for AD/Cycleimmediately by installing PS/2 personal computers, DB2 databases and all ofthe other currently available systems and software products that AD/Cyclewill eventually incorporate.andP;  The company also recommends that customersbegin to prepare organizationally by starting to draw up a model of how theirbusinesses work and preparing a portfolio of existing applications.andM;At first, the users most interested in AD/Cycle will probably be IBM's largermainframe customers, although as the independent vendor community developsAD/Cycle-compliant products, virtually all IBM customers could feelAD/Cycle's impact.andM;But, realistically, we believe that many IS organizations are ill preparedfor the profound cultural and organizational changes necessary for successfulAD/Cycle implementation.andP;  AD/Cycle represents CASE at its most sophisticated:as an integrated, full life-cycle, business-model-driven, knowledge-basedsystem.andP;  Thus in order to take advantage of AD/Cycle, customers first willneed to build a credible vision of their company's future applicationsoftware development and maintenance needs and then figure out how to managethe achievement of that vision.andM;Second, organizations must assess where they are with tools, methods and thesoftware development process.andP;  Improving that process requires feedback atvarious levels, and metrics are at the core of such a feedback mechanism.andO;Organizations that haven't done so should introduce a metrics program withinthe context of continuous process improvement.andP;  They must considerintroducing standard life cycles that can be continually refined andimproved.andM;What IBM Needs to DoandM;All of these customer preparations will take time, which is just as well,considering the challenges and risks IBM faces before it can realize itsextremely ambitious AD/Cycle strategy.andM;First, IBM must coordinate a significant amount of development work betweenits diverse laboratories if it is to deliver the products within the next twoyears.andM;Second, as with SAA, IBM's marketing strategy relies on cooperation with theindependent vendor community for the long-term success of AD/Cycle.andP;  But, asIBM makes ever louder noises about being itself in the software and servicesbusiness, this symbiosis with its competitors might be difficult to maintain.andM;For example, although IBM will be offering KnowledgeWare's front-end CASEtools, it will not be offering IEW/Gamma, KnowledgeWare's code generator,which competes with IBM's own CSP.andP;  Index Technology has announced anagreement with Ontologic Inc. of Billerica, Mass., through which it expectsto produce a repository based on an object-oriented database that willcompete with IBM's repository.andP;  How will the professional services work beparceled out among the services vendors, including IBM's Systems IntegrationDivision?andP;  Also, what will be the impact on those CASE vendors that alreadyoffer integrated CASE solutions, or who offer CASE components that have notbeen included in the AD/Cycle announcement?andM;Another question mark in the AD/Cycle marketing strategy concerns IBM as asoftware vendor.andP;  IBM has not been particularly successful in sellingsoftware, although there have been some notable exceptions, such as itsCustomer Information and Control System (CICS) and the DB2 relationaldatabase system.andP;  How well will IBM's marketing organization be able functionin this new environment?andM;A Tough SellandM;Will IBM be able to convince a customer base that has taken years to achievesomething close to a 1:1 ratio of 3270 display terminals to programmers toswitch to costly high-end PS/2s with bit-mapped graphics and icons?andP;  Maybe,but there has been strong resistance to the transition from software as acraft to systems as an engineering discipline, particularly in the UnitedStates.andM;Our research shows that still less than 20% of the IS marketplace haspurchased a CASE tool.andP;  The reception of AD/Cycle, a sophisticated,comprehensive CASE environment, may prove highly challenging--maybe evenbeyond the industry's capacity.andM;Third, much of the technical detail concerning AD/Cycle is still missing, andin many ways the strategy raises more questions than it answers.andP;  Among thekey questions are what will the repository model be? and how will users andvendors be able to extend it while maintaining its integration features?andO;What will the new Common Programming Interface (CPI) for the repository looklike, and how well will it work?andP;  What are the performance implications ofputting an object management system on top of the DB2 relational database?andO;Will CSP really be suitable for &quot;industrial strength&quot; applications, and howwell will the COBOL generation version perform in high-volume applications?andO;How will local area network capabilities fit into the AD/Cycle architecture?andO;With AD/Cycle, IBM seems to be moving toward application architectures thatrequire special run time components (such as CSP/AE).andP;  What will these be,and what licensing and performance issues will they raise?andM;Once all of the questions are answered and the roadblocks are overcome,AD/Cycle should enable software developers to concentrate on activities thatprovide more tangible business value, rather than on the overhead activitiesof interfacing applications to one another or maintaining redundant data.andM;So here it is in 1990, over 200 years since Diderot complained of lack ofstandard measures, and we have a description of a comprehensive framework forthe development of information systems.andP;  Although AD/Cycle is not here todayas a complete technology, it does present a future that can give us hope forthe progress we have been expecting in the use of computers.andM;Vaughan Merlyn is chairman and Gregory Boone is president of CASE ResearchCorp., a Bellevue, Wash., independent research organization that studies CASEimplementation.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
