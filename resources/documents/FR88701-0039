Newman, Jr., Project Officer, MarineEnvironmental Response and Port Safety Branch, Eighth Coast Guard District;Margie G. Hegy, Project Manager, Office of Navigation Safety and WaterwayServices, Coast Guard Headquarters; and Christena G. Green, Project Counsel,Office of Chief Counsel, Coast Guard Headquarters. <ITAG tagnum="84">Background </ITAG>The Ports and Waterways Safety Act (PWSA), 33 U.S.C. 1223 authorizes theSecretary of the Department in which the Coast Guard is operating to establishtraffic separation schemes and shipping safety fairways, where necessary,to provide safe access routes for vessels proceeding to or from UnitedStates ports. The PWSA also authorizes the Secretary to adjust the location or limitsof designated shipping safety fairways in order to accommodate the needsof other uses which cannot be reasonably accommodated otherwise. The adjustment,however, cannot adversely affect the purpose for which the existing designationwas made and the need for which continues. A shipping safety fairway is an area in which no fixed structures, temporaryor permanent, are permitted. Shipping safety fairways are routing measureswhich provide safe port access routes for vessels where the primary riskto vessels is collision with offshore structures. Vessel use of shippingsafety fairways is voluntary and the direction of traffic flow within ashipping safety fairway may be recommended. Shipping safety fairways mayinhibit exploration for and exploitation of mineral resources in the designatedarea.Before establishing or adjusting a shipping safety fairway, the PWSA requiresthe Coast Guard to conduct a port access route study taking into accountall other uses of the area under consideration and ensuring that the interestsof all affected parties are considered. These uses include, as appropriate,the exploration for, or exploitation of, oil, gas or other mineral resources;the construction or operation of deepwater ports or other structures; theestablishment or operation of marine or estuarine sanctuaries; and activitiesinvolving recreational or commercial fishing. Publication of a notice ofstudy advises all bidders in future lease sales that occupancy rights withinthe study area may be restricted by a routing measure developed as a resultof the study. In the interest of promoting a multiple use approach to offshorewaters, the Coast Guard, as far as practicable, will try to minimize impactson other uses of the area. Once a shipping safety fairway is designatedunder the authority of the PWSA, however, the paramount right of navigationis recognized within the designated area. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory History </ITAG>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE) originally developed the systemof shipping safety fairways in the Gulf of Mexico as areas in which nopermits for structures would be issued. These shipping safety fairwayswere established to control the erection of structures and to provide safeapproaches through oil fields in the Gulf of Mexico to entrances to themajor ports along the Gulf Coast. Once established, the shipping safetyfairways were subject to modification after consideration of the viewsof interested parties, and advance publication of any adverse determination.The Mobile Safety Fairway was established by the COE in 1966 (31 FR 955,January 26, 1966). In 1968 it was renamed the Mobile Ship Channel SafetyFairway (33 FR 15797, October 25, 1968). The 1978 Amendments to the PWSA required the Coast Guard to undertake aport access route study to determine the need for traffic separation schemesand shipping safety fairways to increase vessel traffic safety in offshoreareas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. The Coast Guardinitiated this study by publishing a Notice of Proposed Study on April16, 1979 (44 FR 22543). For purposes of this port access route study, theU.S. coastline was divided into 32 geographically defined areas. The EighthCoast Guard District, New Orleans, LA, conducted the study for area 21which included Mobile, AL. Through public participation and governmentagency consultation, the study evaluated potential traffic density patterns,waterways use conflicts, and the need for safe access routes in offshoreareas. The Study Results for area 21 were published on October 8, 1981, (46 FR49989). The Coast Guard concluded that the fairway network in the Gulfof Mexico was effective, and recommended only minor changes to the existingshipping safety fairways. There were no recommendations to modify the MobileShip Channel Safety Fairway. However, to make the other recommended changesunder the authority of the PWSA, it was necessary for the Coast Guard tofirst adopt the existing COE shipping safety fairway designations. On May13, 1982, (47 FR 20580) the Coast Guard adopted, without change, the shippingsafety fairways designated by the COE and published them in 33 CFR Part166. On June 30, 1983, (48 FR 30108) the Coast Guard revised the rules in 33CFR Part 166 and published the definition of ``shipping safety fairway''as a lane or corridor in which no artificial island or fixed structure,whether temporary or permanent, will be permitted. On August 5, 1985, Texaco Producing Inc. (TPI) requested that the CoastGuard adjust the southernmost four miles of the western boundary of theMobile Ship Channel Safety Fairway to accommodate a proposed drilling andproduction site. In response to TPI's request, on February 2, 1986, the Coast Guard publisheda Notice of Proposed Study to be conducted by the Eighth Coast Guard District(51 FR 6923). The port access route study was also announced in the EighthCoast Guard District's Local Notice to Mariners in April and May 1986.<ITAG tagnum="84">Port Access Route Study </ITAG>The study area encompassed the southernmost four miles of the Mobile ShipChannel Safety Fairway (hereinafter referred to as the fairway), and thearea at the junction of the Mobile to Pensacola Safety Fairway, the MobileShip Channel to Sea Safety. Fairway, the Mississippi River-Gulf Outletto Mobile Ship Channel Safety Fairway, and the Horn Island Pass to MobileShip Channel Safety Fairway. The configuration of the existing fairway, established by the COE in 1966to provide a structure free access route to the port of Mobile, has neverbeen changed. The portion of this fairway examined during the port accessroute study was the flared seaward end. This section is two miles wideat its northern end and flares to five and one-half miles at its southernend where it joins with four other fairways to form a junction area. TheMobile Outer Bar Entrance Channel (Bar Channel), which is 42 feet deep,600 feet wide and approximately 8 miles in length, is near the center ofthis section of the fairway. The Mobile Entrance Lighted Whistle Buoy (hereinafterreferred to as the sea buoy), is located at the seaward end of the BarChannel. This sea buoy is used by mariners to line up with the channelentrance and is a reference point for the boarding of pilots. The requested adjustment would modify the last four miles of the westernboundary along a line connecting the following points:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Latitude </T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22"/><T3>Longitude </T3><ITAG tagnum="23">30anddegrees;10andmin16;36andmin16;andmin16; N. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">88anddegrees;03andmin16;53andmin16;andmin16; W. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="23">30anddegrees;08andmin16;10andmin16;andmin16; N. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">88anddegrees;04andmin16;40andmin16;andmin16; W. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="23">30anddegrees;07andmin16;15andmin16;andmin16; N. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">88anddegrees;06andmin16;54andmin16;andmin16; W.</ITAG>The study examined TPI's need for the requested adjustment of the westernboundary of the fairway. TPI's federal lease, Mobile Area Block 869, islocated entirely within the present fairway. Block 869 is close to an areathat has proven highly productive of natural gas by wells drilled on nearbyFederal and State oil and gas leases. (See Figure 1.) <ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4910-14-M 001 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illus. 2 265 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4910-14-C </ITAG>Because no structures, temporary or permanent, are permitted within shippingsafety fairways, the only access to Block 869 is by directional drillingfrom TPI's adjacent Block 868, outside the fairway. Current drilling technologylimits the maximum horizontal displacement in Mobile Bay Norphlet Wellsto approximately 6,000 feet. TPI's optimum well sites are greater than6,000 feet from the present fairway boundaries. The limitations of directionaldrilling from outside the present fairway prevent access to these sitesand would preclude recovery of an estimated 120 billion cubic feet (BCF)of gas reserves. Adjusting the western boundary will remove a portion ofBlock 869 from the fairway, allowing TPI to access an estimated additional106 BCF of gas reserves. The lease on Block 869 will expire on May 31,1989, unless TPI demonstrates that the lease is productive. The Minerals Management Service (MMS) validated TPI's estimate of the additionalrecovery of 106 BCF of gas with the fairway adjustment. MMS found that,although somewhat complex and costly, it is possible to drill additionaldrainage wells from outside the current fairway. However, MMS concludedthat the associated risks involved in drilling and completion operationsfrom outside the present fairway outweigh any potential benefits that wouldbe derived. MMS further concluded that TPI does not have a reasonable alternatemeans of accessing the target area, nor does it have an alternate drillsite which would be less intrusive on the fairway. MMS supports the requestfor the fairway adjustment because it will permit more efficient explorationof the Federal oil and gas lease on Block 869. The study also examined the configuration of the fairway; the impact ofa fairway adjustment; existing and potential vessel traffic; local conditionswithin the study area; deep draft vessel maneuvering characteristics; COEdredging and channel-deepening projects; and, environmental factors. The study included contacts with other Federal agencies, state governmentofficials, and comments from the maritime community. Discussions were heldwith representatives of TPI, COE, Mobile Bar Pilots Association, AlabamaState Docks Department and the Coast Guard Marine Safety Office, Mobile,AL. The Coast Guard received 24 comments as a result of this study, threeof which raised objections to the requested adjustment. The Coast Guard Marine Safety Office, Mobile, reported approximately 1,200round trips by vessels transiting the channel via the sea buoy in calendaryear 1985. About 200 of these were deep draft vessels. Approximately 40%of these vessels used the west and southwest fairways in the approachesto Mobile. The COE estimated, based on existing and projected commodity movementsfor the Port of Mobile, that channel use for all sizes of vessels by theyear 2005 would be 1,671 round trips and 1,978 round trips by the year2015. A National Ocean Service hydrographic survey reported considerable shoalingalong the eastern edge of the Bar Channel causing deep-draft vessels tofavor the outbound or western edge of the channel even when inbound. However,the COE has a planned three-phase project to deepen and widen the Bar Channel.The first phase will deepen the channel to 47 feet and maintain the currentwidth of 600 feet. This phase will be completed in 1990. Two additionalphases will deepen the channel to 57 feet and widen it to 800 feet. Inconjunction with the first phase of this project, the sea buoy will berelocated approximately .575 nautical miles seaward along the entrancechannel range to 30anddegrees;07andmin16;33andmin16;andmin16; N. latitude and 88anddegrees;04andmin16;06andmin16;andmin16;W longitude. The National Ocean Service commented that the requested fairway adjustmentwill actually improve vessel safety from the standpoint of hydrography,and that the new location of the western fairway boundary would guide trafficfurther away from known obstructions. There are currently two drilling structures immediately adjacent to thewestern border of the present fairway in State leaseblocks 531 and 532.The establishment of additional structures outside the fairway would besubject to COE structure permit regulations. Wind and current are predominantly from the southeast; thus, vessels maytend toward the modified western boundary of the fairway. However, throughproper notice and charting, vessels will be aware of structures or otherobstructions that are adjacent to the fairway. The Mobile Bar Pilots Association, the primary users of the Mobile ShipChannel, initially commented that the fairway adjustment would be detrimentalto shipping interests. The pilots were handling vessels up to 140,000 deadweighttonnage and were scheduled for 150,000 deadweight tons in the near future.They believed that the present fairway design allowed a margin for safetyon approach to the entrance of Mobile Ship Channel, but that the adjustmentwould negate the safety margin. The Alabama State Docks Department andthe USCG Marine Safety Office, Mobile, were also concerned about the proximityof the sea buoy to the modified fairway boundary and its effect on navigationsafety. When they learned of the planned relocation of the sea buoy inconjunction with the COE channel-deepening project, this was no longera concern. The distance from the closest point of the modified fairwayto the relocated sea buoy will be .787 nautical miles. The Alabama State Docks Department continues to object to the requestedadjustment if there are other alternative exploratory drilling plans whichwould not require modifying the present fairway configuration. They feelthat adjustment of the fairway should be a last resort measure. In the Gulf of Mexico, shipping safety fairways are funneled to and fromnumerous ports and may encompass a buoyed or other defined channel. Theordinary practice of seamen prescribes that vessels normally navigate withinthe limits of a channel. For deep-draft vessels the impact of the requestedfairway boundary adjustment is negligible because their draft requiresthat they transit the deeper waters of the channel. The fairway encompassingthe channel is still necessary, however, to provide a structure-free portaccess route to Mobile and to allow smaller vessels to safely navigateoutside the defined channel. Piloted vessels are usually constrained by their draft to using the channeland are committed to line up and transit via the buoyed entrance channel.Relocation of the sea buoy moves the reference point for vessels that requirepilotage and will shift the navigational maneuvering of deep-draft vesselsfurther seaward, providing an adequate safety margin.While all the intersecting shipping safety fairways in the approach toMobile are approximately two miles wide, the portion of the fairway surroundingthe sea buoy is considerably wider. The original fairway design for thisarea created a wide convergence of the intersecting shipping safety fairwayswhich allows for a margin of safety for vessels meeting in the vicinityof the sea buoy and sufficient maneuverability for vessels embarking anddebarking pilots. The adjusted fairway will be greater than two miles wideand will continue to provide a safe area for vessel maneuvering and embarkingand debarking pilots. No data was received to indicate that the requestedadjustment will reduce the present level of navigation safety. Relocation of the sea buoy will be required before making the requestedadjustment to the fairway boundary. TPI's need can not be reasonably accommodated without the proposed adjustmentto the fairway. While there exists a continuing need for this fairway,the Coast Guard concludes that the requested modification is feasible andwill not unacceptably adversely affect the original purpose of the fairway.Therefore the Coast Guard proposes to modify the western boundary of theMobile Ship Channel Safety Fairway as requested by TPI. The sea buoy willbe relocated prior to adjustment of the fairway. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Evaluation </ITAG>The proposed regulation is considered to be non-major under. ExecutiveOrder 12291 on Federal Regulation and nonsignificant under Department ofTransportation regulatory policies and procedures (44 FR 11034; February26, 1979). The proposed regulation was preceded by a Port Access RouteStudy which considered a variety of issues including its economic impact.No adverse economic data was presented in the study.  Adjustment of the western boundary of the existing fairway will providea number of advantages. TPI will recover an estimated 106 BCF of additionalgas reserves. Potential drilling and completion problems would be minimized.The data presented by TPI has been verified by MMS. The Department of theInterior supports the proposed fairway adjustment because the administrationattaches a high priority to the development of domestic oil and gas resourcesand analysis indicates substantial natural gas resources are at stake.The recovery of domestic oil and gas resources will benefit both the Federaland State of Alabama economies. TPI estimates that the additional 106 BCFof natural gas will result in over 45 million dollars in royalty and taxrevenues to the Federal Government and the State of Alabama over a periodof 20 years. Other supporting comments have been received from the entireAlabama U.S. congressional delegation and other political factions. Commentsfrom State of Alabama agencies favor the fairway adjustment. The Departmentof Conservation and Natural Resources, responsible for managing the oiland gas resources located in Alabama's territorial waters, support TPI'sefforts to discover and produce domestic mineral resources as long as thoseefforts are compatible with environmental and public safety concerns. TheDepartment is satisfied that these important concerns will not be adverselyimpacted by the slight fairway adjustment requested. Similarly, the StateOil and Gas Board of Alabama commented that the proposed modification couldfacilitate hydrocarbon exploration on some State and Federal leases byreducing the costs of drilling exploratory wells and well production costs.Further, the requested adjustment could prevent waste by permitting thedrilling and production of wells at more optimum geologic locations, consistentwith sound oil and gas conservation practices. If wells drilled on nearbyFederal and State leases are placed on production, without production fromBlock 869, gas will be lost to them via drainage. MMS concluded that the proposed fairway adjustment benefits adjacent leaseoperators. The modification will release portions of State leases, Blocks113, 131, and 132 and Federal leases, Blocks 868 and 869, from the fairwayrestrictions prohibiting structures. The Coast Guard therefore concludesthat the proposed adjustment will not deny a leaseholder the effectiveexercise of their lease.The economic impact of the proposed fairway adjustment on vessel trafficwill be negligible. The principle economic impact of the proposed adjustmentwill be the projected increase in recovery of gas resources. The economic impact of this proposal is expected to be so minimal thatfurther regulatory evaluation is unnecessary. <ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Impact </ITAG>This action has been thoroughly reviewed by the Coast Guard and it hasbeen determined to be categorically excluded from further environmentaldocumentation, in accordance with section 2.B.2.c. of Commandant Instruction(COMDTINST) M16475.1B. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility </ITAG>The impact of this proposal is expected to be minimal and the Coast Guardcertifies that, if adopted, it will not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities. <ITAG tagnum="84">Federalism </ITAG>This proposed rulemaking has been analyzed in accordance with the principlesand criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determinedthat this proposed rulemaking does not have sufficient federalism implicationsto warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 33 CFR Part 166 </ITAG>Anchorage grounds, Marine safety, Navigation (water), Waterways, ShippingSafety Fairways.
