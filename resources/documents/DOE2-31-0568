Two methods, incremental permeability and magneticBarkhausen noise, were comparatively evaluated. Calibration curves arepresented for both methods. Incremental permeability had a detectabilityup to 2 mm hardening depth while magnetic Barkhausen noise could be appliedto a hardening depth of 4 mm. Profiles for both methods are illustrated.</TEXT></DOC>
