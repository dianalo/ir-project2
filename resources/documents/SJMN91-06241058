The summer shows have been launched, andnow the networks are gearing up for fall. It is the end of the month, so eventhe cable moviemeisters are hibernating.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  SUMMER DOLDRUMS BRING A WILD RASH OF ODD TELEVISION  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     Will you be reduced to watching &quot;Mama's Family&quot;?;   Never one to let thathappen, we've dug into the depths of the TV listings and unearthed somesleeper attractions. These offerings should keep you busy until the big-timeprograms -- you know, the season premiere of &quot;Real Life With Jane Pauley&quot; --come through after Labor Day.;   Michael Landon memorializing begins inearnest this week. The Disney Channel repeats his autobiographical 1983 movie&quot;Sam's Son&quot; (Saturday), a sentimental chronicle of his youthful days as ajavelin champion, starring Timothy Patrick Murphy, with Eli Wallach as hisfather. (Don't confuse this with &quot;The Loneliest Runner,&quot; Landon's 1976 TVmovie about his earlier battles with bed-wetting.);   In the next few weeks,two other Landon salutes come down the line. NBC's two-hour tribute, &quot;MichaelLandon: Memories With Laughter and Love,&quot; on Sept. 17 features reminiscencesfrom Landon's children, Michael Jr. and Leslie, along with &quot;Little House onthe Prairie&quot; star Melissa Gilbert. And clips from Landon's films, TV seriesand talk-show appearances will be edited together with interviews with thosewho worked with him (Wallach, James Garner, Jack Nicholson, Warren Beatty).;  Landon's final work, a two-hour pilot for the series &quot;Us,&quot; runs Sept. 20 onCBS. The movie sets up the country-crossing adventures of an ex-con, played byLandon, who reunites with his father and son to write an &quot;On the Road&quot; kind ofnewspaper column.;   Nostalgia continues on Nick at Nite, where fans of thefabulous '70s can catch two bell-bottomed variety specials Sunday on Nick atNite: &quot;The Sonny andamp; Cher Nitty Gritty Hour,&quot; the pilot for their 1971-74comedy-and-music show, followed by the obviously ill-fated &quot;Brady Bunch Hour,&quot;in which Mike and Carol's clan dances and sings and has other tedious, good,clean fun with guests Donny and Marie Osmond.;   What could America have beenthinking?;   Another fun show is an overlooked cable series gem -- &quot;ManiacMansion,&quot; starting its second season Sunday on the Family Channel. Don't letthe channel's squeaky-clean reputation scare you away from this self-described&quot;sweet and loony&quot; comedy about a family headed by semi-successful scientistFred Edison, played by Joe Flaherty of &quot;SCTV.&quot; That beloved series' wackysensibility lives on here (Eugene Levy is head writer). Past Edisonexperiments have resulted in Edison's Hulk Hogan-size 4-year-old son and hishuman-fly uncle.;   But experiments highlight the season opener, &quot;Luck Be aLady This Season,&quot; with Flaherty walking the audience through the &quot;ManiacMansions&quot; that might have been -- such rejected-pilot possibilities as aBritish-Mexican co-production, a &quot;Married . . . With Children&quot; rip-offcomplete with hooting audience (Flaherty does a mean Ed O'Neill imitation) andeven a &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; approach, with moody music, doughnuts and oodles ofsymbolism. &quot;Then somebody came up with the mutation angle,&quot; Flaherty says, intime for last season's premiere.;   And thank goodness. TV's much-vauntedinnovation lives here, and happily. Even this episode's jokes about &quot;HomeAlone&quot; and George Harrison's plagiarism problem fit. It's a family show thatdoesn't forget adults are part of the family.;   It's not true that all thegood stuff is on cable. Just most of it.;   The un-wired get 22 syndicatedhours of the &quot;MDA Jerry Lewis Labor Day Telethon&quot; on Sunday and Monday.Besides hosts Lewis, Ed McMahon and Leeza Gibbons, there's the usual parade ofstars doing their show-biz things.;   The Monday holiday also brings anotherawards show, &quot;The Emmy Craft Awards&quot; (on Fox), which highlights all thebehind-the-scenes achievements judged not interesting enough to compete in themain Emmy show Sunday with all those fascinating major awards (zzzzzz).;   Gocostume shopping with the &quot;In Living Color&quot; Fly Girls; check out the makeupand photography behind &quot;Quantum Leap&quot;; follow the special-effects work for&quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation,&quot; and more. It's followed by a &quot;We Love Lucy&quot;special featuring Milton Berle.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  DIANE WERTS, Newsday  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910828  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  August  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  729  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday, August 28, 199100241058,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
