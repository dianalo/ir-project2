The suit, which was filed by Milton Berns and seeks class-action status, challenges the Miami thrift's interpretation of preferred stockholders' conversion rights in its proposed acquisition by Kinder-Care Inc., a holding company based in Montgomery, Ala. Mr. Berns says he is a holder of the thrift's $2.19 convertible preferred stock Series A, American Savings said.    A similar suit was filed earlier by Gerald Wolfe, who is represented by the same law firm as Mr. Berns, the company said.    American Savings said it and Kinder-Care intend to proceed with the proposed acquisition and &quot;to defend vigorously&quot; against the suit. </TEXT></DOC>
