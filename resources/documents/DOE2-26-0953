Sufficient positive deviationsof the molar volume from the same one, calculated according to additivitylaw, especially in 50-60 mol% ZrF/sub 4/ and HfF/sub 4/ region were established.This is probably related with formation of complex zirconium and hafniumgroups in melts. The value of deviations is higher for hafnium systemas compared to zirconium one; this testifies to strengthening of interactionwith lithium fluoride when passing to hafnium fluoride. Concentrationdependences of {sigma} are characterized by similar shapes for both meltswith zirconium fluoride and hafnium fluoride.</TEXT></DOC>
