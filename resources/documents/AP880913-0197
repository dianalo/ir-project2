About 150 leftist rebels attacked the garrison at El Paraiso,headquarters of the 4th Army Brigade, shortly after 1 a.m. Tuesdaywith mortars and small arms fire.   A two-hour battle left nine soldiers and seven guerrillas dead,according to Col. Ciro Lopez Roque, garrison commander. He said 12soldiers and an undetermined number of rebels were wounded.   Col. Galileo Torres, head of the armed forces press office, toldThe Associated Press in a telephone interview that governmentforces inflicted 50 casualties on guerrillas in northern Morazanprovince between late Monday and shortly before dawn Tuesday. Nobreakdown of dead and wounded was given.   Morazan and Chalatenango are the two of El Salvador's 14provinces where guerrillas maintain a constant presence, movefreely and administer some towns and villages.   In the capital, about 300 riot troops clashed with approximately3,000 university students marching to the Finance Ministry todemand increased government spending on education.   The helmeted troopers, some carrying assault rifles and otherstoting plastic shields and nightsticks, fell in behind the marchersand continuously prodded, shoved and insulted the demonstrators.   When one student turned to confront them, he was beaten byseveral troopers. A melee ensued, with sporadic pistol and riflefire resounding through the streets for nearly 30 minutes. Thetroopers fired tear gas to disperse the demonstrators.   Officers on the scene said urban commandos of the leftistFarabundo Marti National Liberation Front fired pistols from withinthe crowd of demonstrators.   Reporters saw more than 200 demonstrators arrested and shovedinto buses. Several were bleeding from beatings.   A riot trooper told the AP a policeman was killed by fire fromthe demonstrators.   The riot troops shoved and insulted journalists, fired burstslow over their heads and forced them to lie face-down on thepavement.   ``Don't move!,'' one shouted at the prostrate reporters. ``Thisis what you get for only telling lies!''   The National Police, contacted by the AP, declined immediatecomment on the clash in San Salvador.   In the western provincial capital of Santa Ana, troops of the2nd Infantry Brigade tangled with local university studentsmarching to demand a bigger budget.   The independent radio station KL reported from Santa Ana thatgunfire wounded two students and two soldiers, that 20demonstrators were beaten and an undetermined number were arrested.   At El Paraiso, reporters were shown the bodies of six guerrillason the base's soccer field. Lopez Roque said the body of a womanguerrilla was found about a half-mile from the base.   Troops were still mopping up around Morazan's Gigante Hilloutside Perquin, 125 miles northeast of San Salvador, as of midday,Torres said.   There was no way to immediately confirm the official casualtyfigures.   Early this month, the military press office said 25 guerrillaswere killed during combat around Tejutepeque in central ElSalvador. Reporters who went to the scene found four rebels killed.   Precise casualty figures are hard to pin down as the guerrillasmake every effort to remove their dead from the battlefield.   Five soldiers were wounded in the Morazan fighting, Torres said.   Torres said reporters would not be taken to the combat zonesince helicopters ferrying wounded soldiers and supplies came underguerrilla fire hours after the fighting stopped.</TEXT></DOC>
