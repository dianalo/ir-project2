The U.S. side had threatened lawsuits both in Japan and theUnited States unless a settlement was reached.   Representatives from seven Japanese construction firms andAmerican officials signed the Memorandum of Intent on behalf of 99Japanese firms, the U.S. Justice Department said in a statement.   The memorandum stipulates that the payment be made by December20, according to the statement, which was released by the U.S.Embassy.   Officials from Japanese companies involved in negotiations werenot available for comment because of a national holiday in Japan.   The U.S. government alleges 140 Japanese construction andrelated firms were involved in the bid rigging and the statementsaid the Justice Department would continue to seek damages from the41 not covered by the memorandum.   Some executives among the 41 firms have said they should nothave to pay compensation since they did not bid on the disputedsections of the project. The 41 firms are expected to hold aseparate talks with the U.S. side.   In the negotiations, the U.S. side demanded a total of $34.8million in compensation from the 140 firms, which participated inconstruction projects at the U.S. Navy base at Yokosuka, southwestof Tokyo, between April 1984 and September 1987.   During the period, the U.S. Navy awarded 140 firms a combinedtotal of $134.9 million worth of orders, including construction ofa housing complex for military personnel.   The U.S. side claimed there were improper charges andbid-rigging in connection with the construction at the base.    In December, Japan's Fair Trade Commission issued warnings to140 Japanese firms for their alleged prior consultations, or``dango,'' in setting prices of projects undertaken at the base.   The dango system, long established in Japan's constructionindustry, is considered an anti-competitive practice that preventsfirms outside the group, including foreign firms, from gettingcontracts.   In another development, the U.S. government said Wednesday itwould not impose retaliatory sanctions against Japan in a tradedispute over the ability of American companies to compete forconstruction work in Japan.   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills said she determined thatJapan had made ``significant progress'' in allowing U.S. companiesto compete on construction jobs, including allowing Americancompanies to bid on five major airport projects.</TEXT></DOC>
