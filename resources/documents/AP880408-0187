MILLER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An opposition leader who led a hugerally against Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega last month has beenreleased from prison and ordered out of the country, his lawyersaid Friday.   Carlos Ernesto Gonzalez de la Lastra, 49, was freed Thursdaynight after being held for 10 days in El Modelo Prison followinghis arrest March 28 when police stopped the protest march he wasleading.   Alvin Weeden, his attorney, said Gonzalez would stay at theVatican Embassy until leaving Sunday with his wife, Vilma for exilein Venezuela.   ``There was no other remedy,'' said Weeden. He said Gonzalezfaced a long prison term on a sedition charge filed by thegovernment last summer if he did not accept exile.   Noriega commands Panama's 15,000-member Defense Forces andcontrols the civilian government. He has been indicted on narcoticstrafficking charges in the United States, which has supported a10-month-old opposition campaign to oust him.   The Reagan administration invoked more economic sanctions Fridayon Panama, including a tighter freeze on Panamanian assets in theUnited States. Although assets already were frozen by court ordersought by the administraton, the new action has the effect of lawand prevents Noriega from overturning the freeze by appealing thecourt order.   The new sanctions also include prohibiting payments to theregime by all people and organizations in the United States and byU.S. citizens and organizations in Panama.   The previous sanctions, which included the withholding of U.S.payments to the Panama Canal Commission, created a severe cashshortage in Panama, which uses the U.S. dollar as its currency.   Gonzalez was free on bond on the sedition charge when he wasarrested during the demonstration that preceded a police raid on anopposition headquarters at Panama City hotel. In all, more than 40people were picked up in the sweep, including eight foreignjournalists.   The reporters were freed within hours and most of the otherswere released the next day. But the government kept Gonzalez incustody and refused to let anyone except his wife visit him. Shesaid he had been beaten.   ``They never filed (new) charges against Carlos Ernesto,'' saidWeeden. ``But state security adduced (his guilt) from a photo ofCarlos Ernesto carrying a flag in the March 28 demonstration thatwas published in a North American newspaper.''   A former director of the now-closed opposition newspaper LaPrensa, Gonzalez was ordered into exile in 1976 by Gen. OmarTorrijos, who preceded Noriega as Panama's military strongman.Gonzalez spent two years in Venezuela before being allowed toreturn.   Gonzalez is one of 35 directors of the National Civic Crusade, acoalition of some 200 business, labor, professional and politicalgroups that has been seeking Noriega's ouster since last June.   Carrying a large Panamanian flag, he led the march last monththat police and soldiers broke up with tear gas, shotguns andrubber truncheons. About 10,000 people took part in the protest.   Since last month's demonstration, Noriega's regime has harassedand briefly detained a number of other opposition leaders,surrounding the homes of at least three of them with state securityagents for periods of up to 12 hours.   Most leaders of the Civic Crusade have kept a low profile. Newsconferences, which used to be held almost daily, have been replacedby telephone calls and communiques slipped into the hotel messageboxes of reporters.   NOriegas government's new, get-tough policy appeared in part tobe a defiant answer to U.S. economic sanctions and diplomatic movesaimed at fortifying the internal opposition's efforts to remove thegeneral.   The Reagan administration completed a 1,300-man militarybuild-up in Panama on Thursday. The new troops brought to 11,800the number of U.S. military personnel guarding the Panama Canal,which has operated normally throughout the crisis, and protectingAmerican citizens living in the country.   About 800 Marines arrived Friday from Camp Pendleton, Calif.,for three weeks of jungle warfare training that the White Housesaid had nothing to do with the build-up of the U.S. SouthernCommand, which is based in Panama. The command is responsible forall American military operations in Central and Latin America.</TEXT></DOC>
