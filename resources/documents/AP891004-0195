They agreed earlier to revamp Parliament with an equal number ofMoslems and Christians in an effort to end the 14-year-old civilwar.   Any agreement, however, must win the support of powerfulwarlords who have controlled much of Lebanon since fighting beganin 1975. Moslem militia leaders Nabih Berri and Walid Jumblattreportedly gave negative assessments of the Taif efforts onWednesday.   Militia leaders have been kept away from the meeting.   The conflict is a battleground for conflicting Arab interests aswell as for Lebanese factions. The war has killed at least 150,000people and turned much of the capital, Beirut, into rubble.   Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani warned the legislatorsWednesday not to surrender to domination by Maronite Catholics.   ``If they give in, they have done a great treason to theLebanese people, and should be seriously confronted,'' the IslamicRepublic News Agency quoted Rafsanjani as saying.   Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati earlier Wednesdayrejected decisions taken by the legislators on grounds they failedto hand over the bulk of political power to Moslems.   In Beirut, two foreign passenger jets _ an Aeroflot flight fromMoscow and a French airliner _ landed at the airport Wednesday, thefirst since the airport reopened nearly two weeks ago after acease-fire that ended six months of shelling duels between Moslemand Christian militias.   Thirty-three Christian and 30 Moslem legislators, representingall but 10 of the body's surviving 73 members, met for a fifth dayto discuss reforms aimed at ending the war.   They agreed Tuesday to expand the 99-seat Parliament and toensure an equal distribution between Christians and Moslems.   The last official census conducted in 1932 showed Christiansmade up a majority of the population, but later estimates sayMoslems make up 55 percent of Lebanon's 4 million people.   On Wednesday, the deputies talked of using a merit system tofill government jobs.   Sources at the meeting, who spoke on condition of anonymity,said all deputies opposed continuing the present sectarian systembut differed on how and when to change it.   Some Christian speakers made reform conditional on a withdrawalof Syrian forces from Lebanon, the sources said.   Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal and other mediatorsmet Christian deputies, apparently to try to persuade them to dropthis condition.   Deputies also discussed possible expansion of the premier'spowers at the expense of the president.   Under an unwritten 1943 national covenant, power was shared by aMaronite Catholic president, a Sunni Moslem premier and a ShiiteMoslem Parliament speaker, with top government, army and publicadministration posts going to the Maronites.   One Parliament member, who spoke on condition of anonymity, saidabolishing political factionalism ``is an issue too explosive forthe parliamentarians to handle without the prior consent of thewarlords who control the Lebanese arena.''   Iran's state-run news agency IRNA said Rafsanjani's statementcame after he met in Tehran with four Lebanese Moslem leaders:Berri, leader of the Shiite Amal movement; Jumblatt, the Drusechieftain; Sheik Subhi Tufaili, a leader of the Shiite Hezbollah,or Party of God; and Sheik Saeed Shaaban, head of a Syrian- andLibyan-backed Sunni fundamentalist faction.   Velayati told a news conference in Tehran ``we can place no hopein the Taif meeting,'' Iranian TV reported.   ``Since the majority of the Lebanese people are Moslems, it isnatural that the principal rule in Lebanon must be in the hands ofMoslems,'' he said.   ``If any decision is made at Taif or elsewhere that contradictsthis basic principle ... it will not be accepted by the Moslem andnationalist forces, and it will be rejected by Iran and Syria,''Velayati said.   The broadcast and IRNA dispatch were monitored in Cyprus.   Jumblatt and Berri say Syrian troops are needed to guarantee asettlement.   Iranian TV said Amal issued a statement saying the Taif meetingwill not reach a just solution to Lebanon's crisis.   In Beirut, the Christian-run Voice of Lebanon quoted Jumblatt assaying a cease-fire that began late last month was just an``intermission'' in the war.   Iran is a major backer of Shiites in Lebanon, who are estimatedto be the largest sect there.   Supporters of Christian leader Gen. Michel Aoun, a Maronite,demand a timetable for a pullout of Syria's 40,000 troops fromLebanon before considering political reforms.   If agreement is reached on reforms, the Lebanese parliamentwould convene in Beirut to ratify them formally, with a tentativedate set at Oct. 21.</TEXT></DOC>
