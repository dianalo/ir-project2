Stockdale, its new chairman and chief executive officer, paid $46 a share, or about $5.5 million, for his 21.4% stake.    As previously reported, Mr. Stockdale bought the stake from Terence J. Fox, who resigned the posts Tuesday. In addition to buying the 119,853 common shares Mr. Fox had held, Mr. Stockdale paid $3 million to Mr. Fox in exchange for a 10-year noncompetition agreement. Mr. Stockdale also reimbursed Mr. Fox $300,000 for certain expenses.    Mr. Stockdale, former chairman and chief executive of British Benzol PLC, a mining company, bought the Iroquois stake because he believes the company's drug products and brand recognition have &quot;tremendous growth potential,&quot; especially in European markets, Iroquois said. Iroquois makes and markets vitamin and pharmaceutical products.    Iroquois shares rose on the news. The company's stock was delayed in opening on the American Stock Exchange, pending the announcement. Iroquois stock closed at $27.625, up $3.75.    Joseph Sweeney, president and chief operating officer of Iroquois, said the company did not &quot;know of any reason for the increase.&quot;    Mr. Stockdale, 43 years old, is chairman, president and chief executive of Bio International, a Houston holding company. A woman who answered the phone at Bio's office said she wasn't able to comment on what the company's business is. She also said Mr. Stockdale wasn't available to comment. </TEXT></DOC>
