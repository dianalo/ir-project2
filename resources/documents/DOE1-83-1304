Investigatorsreviewed recent achievements and made recommendations for further improvementof working condions, diagnosis and treatment of illness to enable increasedproductivity and better health of miners. Application of a complex ofhealth measures from 1975 to 1985 reduced occupational illness. Duringthe period, investigations of pathogenesis of pneumoconiosis continued.It was shown that the higher the cytotoxicity and fiber production ofdust, the more uneven the electron density on the surface of dust particlescausing their cumulative attack and the biologic aggressiveness of coaldust. Patients with anthrasilicosis were treated beneficially with hyperbaricoxygenation in addition to the usual methods. In treating patients withchronic bronchitis endobronchial (introduction of antibiotics into thelungs) treatment proved more effective than the usual methods. Improvedtreatment of patients in health clinics, development of automated systemsfor conducting medical surveys, organization of supervision of patientswith anthrasilicosis and dust bronchitis have had positive results. Continueddevelopment of above improvements is recommended for the future.</TEXT></DOC>
