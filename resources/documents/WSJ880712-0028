McCarthy (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> CMD PCS MIN </IN><TEXT>   Weekend rains in the Midwest, and forecasts for still more rain this week, sent soybean and corn futures prices plummeting their permitted daily limits.    The anticipated rainfall isn't expected to be heavy, or drought-breaking. But, said Ted Mao, a grain specialist with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., &quot;It brings about the question in traders' minds that this may be a prelude to a breaking of the drought pattern.&quot;    The weekend rains came when the jet stream dipped south. Most of this growing season, the jet stream has been far north over Canada, preventing the usual spring and summer storms. As it changes to its more normal spot, it could cause more rainfall across the Corn Belt over the next several days, meteorolgists said.    Rain pelted about one-third of the drought-parched Corn Belt over the weekend, with some of the heaviest moisture in northwestern Iowa. Parts of Iowa were doused with two to three inches of rain.    The soybean contract for November delivery fell the daily limit of 45 cents a bushel to $8.675 a bushel, while the soybean contract for July delivery fell 66 cents to $8.58 a bushel. Corn followed suit, with the contract for December delivery dropping the daily limit of 15 cents a bushel, settling at $3.1125.    Farm futures prices have fallen several times in the past two weeks, following several weeks of a drought-inspired rally. Yesterday's trading seemed to support the notion among some analysts that corn and wheat futures are top-heavy. &quot;The market has been overdone significantly on the upside,&quot; said Richard Loewy, senior grain and oil-seed analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. &quot;The piper has to be paid on the other side.&quot;    And some analysts are looking for more of the same. &quot;I expect the market will continue the recent trend of lower prices and liquidation until we get some bullish indicators,&quot; said Steve Freed, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., in Chicago. &quot;It's a futures market, and what we're concerned about is where the jet stream is going.&quot;    Farm futures prices opened sharply lower and prices quickly dropped to their permissible limit. Aside from making already-jittery traders more jittery, the much-anticipated Agriculture Department report on crop damage had little effect on trading yesterday, analysts said. The report, due out today, for the first time will present the federal government's estimate of the extent of crop damage from the drought.    Despite a weekend of fairly generous rain, the effect on crops is expected to be minimal, said agricultural experts. Indiana, Illinois and Ohio had little rain, said Charles Notis, a meteorologist with Freese-Notis Weather in Des Moines, Iowa. &quot;Where they got a half-inch or so, that will help them for two or three days,&quot; said Dave Mengel, an agronomist with Purdue University. &quot;It doesn't break the situation -- it just prolongs the agony.&quot;    In Iowa, most of the heavy rainfall was in the northwestern two-thirds of the state -- an area that has generally &quot;been doing pretty well all along,&quot; said Garren Benson, an agronomist with Iowa State University. &quot;The southeastern part of the state is the part that needed it most.&quot;    In other commodity markets yesterday:   PRECIOUS METALS: Prices fell sharply in reaction to sharp declines in petroleum and grain prices. Gold for current delivery dropped $4.50 an ounce to $434. Platinum's drop was steeper; platinum for July delivery plunged $25.80 an ounce to $543.50 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The more actively traded October platinum contract fell the daily limit of $25 an ounce to $552.30. Contracts for current delivery trade without a daily limit. Silver for July delivery slipped 6.3 cents to $6.9370 an ounce. Frederick Demler, metals economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., New York, said lower petroleum and grain prices undercut precious metals, which are held by investors as inflation hedges. &quot;Inflation is well contained,&quot; he said. Analysts also attributed the weakness in metals to the dollar's strength earlier in the trading day. When the dollar is weak, gold is a popular alternative investment, and in turn, tends to suffer when the dollar rises.    COPPER: Prices moved lower in sympathy with precious metals and other commodities, but also were hit by the bearish news of a supply buildup. Copper for September delivery fell 2.95 cents a pound to 93.70 cents. In its weekly report of warehouse stocks, the London Metal Exchange said copper stocks rose 6,250 tons to 96,100 tons. The increase &quot;was a bit more than expected,&quot; said Mr. Demler of Drexel Burnham.    SUGAR: Futures contracts for October delivery fell 0.54 cent a pound to 13.39 cents. The decline &quot;related almost exclusively&quot; to the drop in soybean prices, William B. O'Neill, research director at Elders Futures Inc., New York, said. &quot;There was no change in sugar fundamentals. The severe decline in soybean prices takes the edge off some of the other markets,&quot; including sugar, Mr. O'Neill said. </TEXT></DOC>
