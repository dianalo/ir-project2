RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court today made it easier for theU.S. government to turn over tax information and financial recordsto a foreign government.   The 9-0 ruling allows Canadian officials to see financial recordsof two Canadian citizens with bank accounts in Washington state.   The Supreme Court said a federal law aimed at protectingpotential criminal defendants who also are being investigated by theInternal Revenue Service does not apply to tax probes by foreigngovernments.   The Canadian Department of National Revenue, that nation'sequivalent of the IRS, sought records of Philip Stuart and MonsKapoor.   Both Canadian citizens have accounts with the NorthwesternCommercial Bank in Bellingham, Wash.   The Canadian officials said they are investigating the taxliability of the two men for 1980, 1981 and 1982.   The officials sought the help of the U.S. government under a 1942treaty between the two nations. The IRS issued summonses to the bankin 1984.   Stuart and Kapoor then asked a U.S. federal judge to block thesummonses. The judge declined, but the 9th U.S. Circuit Court ofAppeals ruled in their favor in 1987.   The appeals court said the bank records must be withheld unlessU.S. officials state that the Canadian tax investigation has notreached a stage analogous to one in this country in which the IRSwould refer the case to the Justice Department for criminalprosecution.   U.S. government officials said the ruling could hinder U.S.treaty obligations and impair the ability of U.S. investigators toobtain foreign financial records.   The Justice Department said tax treaties with 31 foreigngovernments and also exchanges of information under other agreementswith Caribbean Basin nations would be affected.   The Supreme Court today said the federal law barring an IRSsummons when a tax investigation has been referred to the JusticeDepartment does not apply to foreign tax probes.   Justice William J. Brennan, writing for the court, said the lawis intended to safeguard rights of the accused by retaining thegrand jury as a principal tool of criminal prosecution. The law alsois aimed at assuring that criminal defendants will not be forcedbefore trial to divulge information to prosecutors in violation oftheir rights.   But Brennan said those safeguards are not relevant when theinvestigation takes place in a foreign country.   ``None of the countries with whom the United States has taxtreaties providing for exchanges of information employ grand juries,and Canada has ceased to use them,'' Brennan said.   Also, he said, the procedures in foreign countries requiringtargets of investigations to reveal information are considerablydifferent than in the United States.   ``The concerns that prompted Congress to pass (the law protectingsuspects' rights) are therefore not present when the IRS issuessummonses at the request of most foreign governments conductinginvestigations into possible violations of their own tax laws,''Brennan said.   ``So long as the summons meets statutory requirements and isissued in good faith ... compliance is required, whether or not theCanadian tax investigation is directed toward criminal prosecutionunder Canadian law,'' he said.   The case is U.S. vs. Stuart, 87-1064.</TEXT></DOC>
