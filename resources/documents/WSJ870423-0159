The decision by the finance ministry is the latest step in Japan's move in the past several months to gradually liberalize domestic investment policies. The decision also comes as Japanese officials scramble to ease the trade-related friction between their nation and the U.S. that led President Reagan to slap import tariffs on a host of Japanese goods this month.    As a result of the futures decision, Japanese trading eventually could pump billions of additional dollars daily into leading futures markets in the U.S., particularly the Treasury bond futures market, and, to a lesser extent, the stock-index futures market.    The Chicago Board of Trade is scheduled April 30 to begin evening trading of Treasury bond and note futures and futures options to coincide with morning trading of U.S. Treasury securities in Tokyo.    The finance ministry's action will allow Japanese banks, securities firms, insurance companies and investment-trust management companies to trade for their own account in currency, bond, stock-index and other financial futures and futures options listed on overseas exchanges.    Japanese institutions currently trade in foreign financial futures markets through foreign-based subsidiaries, but they account for only a small percentage of the volume in these markets.    Once the ruling takes effect, it will take several months for the insitutions to significantly boost their trading activity in foreign financial futures markets, industry officials in the U.S. and Japan said.    &quot;We expect small but steady growth,&quot; said Shinji Hirabayashi, executive vice president of Daiwa Securities America Inc., the U.S. unit of Daiwa Securities Co. in Tokyo.    Futures industry officials in the U.S. and abroad have been awaiting official word of the move since it was leaked to the Japanese press late last month.    The offshore restrictions were lifted in part, finance ministry officials said, to enable Japanese institutions to trade foreign financial futures to hedge against losses in securities holdings that are denominated in foreign currencies -- in particular, U.S. government securities.    &quot;Our largest interest is, of course, hedging our portfolio of U.S. government securities,&quot; said Shigeki Nihei, a New York representative of Sumitoma Life Insurance Co.    Japanese institutions are major holders of U.S. government securities, at times buying 30% to 40% of the securities sold by the U.S. Treasury at auctions in the past few years.    Their U.S. stock holdings are much smaller, although many Japanese institutions are said to be steadily increasing their purchases of U.S. equities. &quot;In one to two years we may want to hedge in stock-index futures like U.S. institutions do,&quot; said Mr. Nihei.    Finance ministry officials said it may be a year at least before individual Japanese investors are allowed to trade in foreign financial futures markets. </TEXT></DOC>
