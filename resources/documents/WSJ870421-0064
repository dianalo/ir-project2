ExpectsTo Post Pre-Tax LossOf $2.6 Million for Year</HL><DD> 04/21/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> CMRO </IN><DATELINE> ANAHEIM, Calif.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Comarco Inc. said it expects to report a pre-tax loss of about $2.5 million for the fiscal year ended Jan. 31, reflecting in part a previously announced $1.7 million write-off.    In the previous year, the provider of computer-based products and services earned $2 million, or 68 cents a share.    Comarco also said it expects to report revenue of about $75 million to $80 million for the year, almost double year-earlier revenue of $41.7 million.    In January, Comarco said it expected to take the $1.7 million write-off mainly because its Decisions andamp; Designs Inc. unit didn't receive a military contract it anticipated. At that time the company said it expected the write-off to reduce net income to about $1.1 million, or 35 cents a share.    The unanticipated loss beyond the write-off stems from delays in the development of markets for certain of its products and under-utilization of its facilities, the company said.    Glenn D. Buell Jr., chairman, president and chief executive officer, said the company has decided to consolidate certain operations, reducing the number of divisions to nine from 15. A spokesman said the company is also in the process of terminating a total of 50 employees, mostly in administrative, engineering and management positions. Before the terminations, the company had 1,600 employees.    As a result of the loss, Comarco said it isn't in compliance with the certain terms in its bank credit agreements. However, the company said it expects to receive waivers of the provisions based on conversations with its lender, Wells Fargo Bank. </TEXT></DOC>
