The unions are waging aboycott. And, as the strike by 1,200 paperworkers turns 1 year oldThursday, both sides say their resolve holds strong.   ``Whatever it takes, for as long as it takes,'' Dick Tardif saidrecently as he walked a picket line at IP's sprawling Androscogginmill.   The unions are focusing on the United Paperworkers InternationalUnion's national ``corporate campaign.'' Organized by laborstrategist Ray Rogers, it is designed to put financial andpolitical pressure on banks and businesses that own IP stock orhave directors who also serve as IP directors.   The company continues to run the mill, one of its largest,around the clock with about 1,000 replacement workers recruitedelsewhere. It boasts that production is nearly at pre-strikelevels, and it insists the non-union employees are there to stay.   ``They've given up other jobs to come work for the company. Theyendure harassment, intimidation, threats, certainly daily verbalabuse, in some cases acts of violence,'' said IP spokesman RichardWhite.   White said the company accepted ``a moral obligation to thesepeople'' when it hired them and gave the unions repeated warningsthat replacements would be permanent.   ``The strike has gone on too long,'' he said. ``It's time to getit behind us.''   It's been a long, tense year for this once-sleepy western Mainetown, including boisterous rallies and marches and a court order tocurb name-calling, vandalism and occasional violence on the picketlines. A judge cited the unions for contempt, ordering a $10,000fine, and the company is seeking a second citation.   No talks are scheduled. And the Jay strikers, the largest groupamong 3,500 union members embroiled in labor disputes that alsoaffect IP mills in Alabama, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, willautomatically lose any say in the unions' future at the mill as ofThursday's anniversary of their walkout.   The replacements are seeking an election to decertify the UPIUand the International Brotherhood of Firemen and Oilers asbargaining agents for mill employees. After Thursday, by law, onlythe replacement workers may vote.   Union leaders acknowledge it is only a matter of time before theNational Labor Relations Board orders an election, and thatdecertification is inevitable. Instead, they look to their ongoingcampaigns to boycott companies with ties to IP and to buildsolidarity with union members at other IP mills.   ``Right now, all we have (with IP) is a paper relationshipanyway,'' said Jonathan Reitman, a lawyer for UPIU Local 14, whichrepresents the vast majority of strikers. Any election would be``almost irrelevant,'' he said.   ``It's an all-out war'' between the company and the UPIU, saidFelix A. Jacques, executive vice president of Local 14.   Among the union's boycott targets are the PNC Financial Corp., aPittsburgh-based holding company with banks in three states;Coca-Cola Co.; and the Bank of Boston and its subsidiaries inMaine, Connecticut and Rhode Island. The union also may eventuallycall for boycotts of IP products by institutions and governmentagencies, said Jacques.   IP's White cites Rogers' involvement in the 1985 Hormelmeatpackers' strike in Minnesota, which was marred by violence andended a year later with replacement workers still there, asevidence that the campaign against IP will not succeed.   White said production at the Jay mill is up to nearly 94 percentof its average capacity of 1,500 tons a day, compared to 97 percentbefore the June 16 walkout.   The company has sought to divert attention from the replacementworkers and toward the dispute that led to the walkout _ IP'sdemand for looser work rules and elimination of premium pay forSundays and holidays.   But the unions have rejected any proposal that does notguarantee the strikers their old jobs.   The mood could turn uglier this summer, when the strikers' stateunemployment benefits, already extended to the one-year maximum,expire. Strikers, who averaged more than $35,000 a year at themill, can collect weekly unemployment checks of $161 plus $5 perdependent, and less than $100 a week from the union.   Inside the mill, replacement workers are settling in andbuilding their own camaraderie. ``IP Baseball _ 1 Strike andamp; You'reOut,'' reads one employee's T-shirt.</TEXT></DOC>
