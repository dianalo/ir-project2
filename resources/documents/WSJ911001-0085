The government said the back-to-work legislation wasnecessary because of the strike's impact on key activities,including grain shipments. Grain exports from West Coastports and from the Lake Superior port of Thunder Bay werehalted yesterday as grain handlers and longshoremen refusedto cross picket lines manned by government grain inspectors.</LP><TEXT>   The strike, which is in support of contract demands,resumed Friday after a renewed attempt to negotiate asettlement failed last week. The government workers,represented by the Public Service Alliance of Canada, wereearlier on strike from Sept. 9 to Sept. 18.   Gilles Loiselle, the cabinet minister responsible forgovernment contract negotiations, said he expected thatParliament will pass the back-to-work legislation within aweek. Daryl Bean, president of the Public Service Alliance,said the union will announce tomorrow whether it will obeythe back-to-work order.   The Canadian Wheat Board, which handles Canadian exportsof wheat and barley, said the strike has tied up 37 ships atWest Coast ports and five ships at Thunder Bay. VancouverPort Corp. also reported that longshoremen and truck driverswere refusing to cross picket lines at Vancouver's twocontainer terminals. Except for grain, it said shipments ofother commodities, including coal and potash, wereexperiencing no delays.   The government, as part of its effort to curb its budgetdeficit, has said it will freeze government workers' wagesthis year and limit increases to 3% in each of the twofollowing years. The union has demanded that the governmentshow some flexibility in its offer. Many government workersreported to work, as required yesterday, because they weredeemed to hold essential jobs.   Mr. Loiselle, in calling for parliamentary support for theback-to-work bill, said continued strike activity could&quot;jeopardize economic recovery.&quot; The economy is in the earlystages of a pickup from a yearlong recession.   The proposed bill provides for fines of up to 1,000Canadian dollars (US$882) a day for employees who defy theorder.</TEXT></DOC>
