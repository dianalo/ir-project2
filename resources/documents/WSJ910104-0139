Carter in exchangefor an undisclosed financial settlement.   The British company had acquired Mr. Carter's proxysolicitation firm, Carter Organization, for more than $75million in 1987. The firm was renamed Quorum CommunicationsInc. last June. In October, VPI and Quorum were acquired byTranwood Consortium Fund, a British limited partnership, for$17 million.</LP><TEXT>   In the suit, which VPI and its subsidiary, VPI (NorthAmerica) Inc., brought against Mr. Carter last May, theBritish company accused the former proxy king of fraud andbreach of contract. It claimed that Mr. Carter's allegedmisconduct inflated the price VPI paid when it acquiredQuorum. The suit charged that because of the allegedimproprieties, Quorum's credibility and business prospectswere hurt. The suit sought unspecified damages.   Quorum is not a party to the settlement.   Mr. Carter, credited with helping transform thestock-proxy business into a tool of corporate raiders, wassentenced in July to serve between 16 months and four yearsin prison and pay $1 million for restitution after he pleadedguilty to charges of grand larceny and personal income-taxevasion. He joined a work-release program in December, saidElliot Silverman of the Manhattan law firm Gold andamp; Wachtel,which handled the civil action for Mr. Carter.   Mr. Silverman and Peter Earl, chief executive officer ofBritish investment bank Tranwood PLC and Quorum's chairmanand chief executive, declined to comment on the settlement.The investment bank manages Tranwood Consortium Fund.   In November, Quorum filed for protection under Chapter 11of federal bankruptcy law. It sold its stock surveillanceunit to an undisclosed buyer last month.</TEXT></DOC>
