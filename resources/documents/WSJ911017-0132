Conservatives attribute thefailures to a bankruptcy of ideas, while liberals areinclined to blame the GOP for race-baiting.   In &quot;Chain Reaction: The Impact of Race, Rights, and Taxeson American Politics&quot; (W.W. Norton, 339 pages, $22.95),Washington Post reporter Thomas Byrne Edsall elaborates hisagreement with both assessments, but takes his analysis onecrucial step further: The reason Republican candidates areable to exploit racial fears is because Democrats have fueledthese fears through sponsorship of race-specific legislation.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Chain Reaction,&quot; written with Mary D. Edsall, is anexcellent, well-documented account of the growingdisenchantment of white voters with the Democratic Party. Itchronicles how, over the past 25 years, the Democrats havebecome addicted to recognizing and protecting a diverse setof special interest groups and in the process have lost thesupport of key constituencies: white populists in the Southand white European ethnics in the North. It also is about&quot;the problem of the color line&quot; (as W.E.B. Du Bois describedit nearly 100 years ago) in U.S. politics.   &quot;Chain reaction&quot; refers to the collision of race and taxeswith the rights revolution (encompassing every conceivableminority group) and &quot;the rights-related reform movement&quot;within the Democratic Party, which has transformed partyrules and radically altered the party's ethnic, racial andsexual makeup. Taken together, Mr. Edsall writes, theseforces have driven moderates and conservatives out of theDemocratic Party and allowed it to be controlled by liberals.   Mr. Edsall's account of the transformation of Americanpolitics begins in 1964, the year Lyndon Johnson engineeredpassage of the Civil Rights Act, the most significantgovernment action on behalf of black America since theEmancipation Proclamation. That same year the Republicannomination went to Barry Goldwater, a civil rightsconservative, over Nelson Rockefeller, a civil rightsliberal. Goldwater went down in stinging defeat to Johnson,winning only six states.   But while the Democrats won that short-term battle, theRepublicans keep winning the long-term war. Why? Because theDemocratic Party refuses to accept that the legal goals ofthe civil rights movement had been fulfilled by 1968.Democratic support for race-based equal results remedies (asopposed to Republican support for race-neutral equalopportunity) has gone a long way toward delivering the Southto the GOP in the past six presidential elections.   The book is chock full of statistics showing how themiddle and lower classes suffered under Reagan, and Mr.Edsall asks how the GOP is able to garner the votes of thenation's proletariat and bourgeoisie. The answer, he says, isa &quot;conservative egalitarianism&quot; predicated on opposition togovernment intervention. For the wealthy, this oppositiongrows out of a fear of high taxes likely to be imposed by aDemocratic president. For the not-so-wealthy, the oppositionstems from the impression (as well as the reality) that theywould be the victims of Democratic-sponsored affirmativeaction, busing and civil rights-related legislation.   Why can't a liberal egalitarianism win over voters?Because, Mr. Edsall writes, liberalism's &quot;commitment tooppose racism, prejudice, and oppression . . . has carriedwithin it some of the seeds of its own debilitation. As thegoal of liberalism became to secure the rights of minorities. . . the losers, and those who felt themselves likely tolose, began to outnumber the winners.&quot;   Macomb County, Mich., a predominantly white working-classsuburb of Detroit, is a good example of how, in electoralterms, liberalism has failed. While in 1960 Kennedy received63% of Macomb's vote, a whopping 67% chose Reagan in 1984.Focus-group sessions conducted there in 1985 found that &quot;Thespecial status of blacks is perceived by almost all of theseindividuals as a serious obstacle to their personaladvancement. Indeed, discrimination against whites has becomea well-assimilated and ready explanation for their status,vulnerability and failures.&quot;   Mr. Edsall is a liberal (he contributes to Dissent, asocialist journal) and does not spare criticism of the GOP,but his ability to accurately gauge the nation's racial moodis one of the real strengths of this book. &quot;The GOP haspositioned itself just where the overwhelming majority ofwhite Americans stand on racial policy: in favor of theprinciple of equality, but opposed to the enforcementmechanisms developed by the courts and the federal regulatorysystem.&quot; And in one sentence, he delegitimizes the persistentDemocratic claim that Republican candidates win theirelections through racism: &quot;For politicians in virtually everyregion of the country, a direct appeal to racism would befatal.&quot;   As difficult as it might be for guilt-ridden whiteDemocrats to accept, Mr. Edsall's analysis in this case andnearly every other is right on the mark. His book is avaluable contribution to the growing body of thought on &quot;theproblem of the color line.&quot; If national Democrats are seriousabout reviving their party from its presidential coma (thereis some question about this), a careful reading of this bookbehooves them.   ---   Mr. Rees is a reporter for the New Republic and author ofthe forthcoming book &quot;From the Deck to the Sea: Blacks andthe Republican Party.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
