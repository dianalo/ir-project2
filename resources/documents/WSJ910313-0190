In the face of increasing congressional opposition to theproposed arms sales, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and otherhigh-ranking administration officials have abandoned earlierpromises to try to push the package through Congress quicklyafter the end of the Persian Gulf war. Instead, the Saudirequest has been put on hold, and it's expected to remain inlimbo for at least several months until the White Househammers out a new policy for dealing with the general issueof arms sales in the Middle East.</LP><TEXT>   Secretary Cheney acknowledged in a recent interview with agroup of reporters that the overall $15 billion proposal isdead, adding that the administration will &quot;go back and reviewthe bidding {to} see what is required&quot; to protect SaudiArabia's long-term security. Yesterday, Pentagon spokesmanPete Williams said that the current review means that &quot;anydecisions on arms sales in the region are months away.&quot;   Another administration official said the review willfocus, in part, on the larger issues of encouraging armscontrol in the Middle East and dealing with Israeli concernsabout supplying Arab forces with the most sophisticated U.S.missiles and ground-attack planes. With the Iraqi armyshattered and its offensive capability destroyed, somelawmakers and administration officials contend that SaudiArabia no longer needs to buy all of the military hardware itoriginally sought. President Bush plans to meet later thisweek with the leaders of Canada, France and Britain todiscuss, among other things, arms control in the Middle East.   The administration's about-face is sure to disappoint bothSaudi leaders and U.S. weapons manufacturers. McDonnellDouglas Corp., Boeing Co. and General Dynamics Corp. wereamong the leading U.S. companies hoping to benefit from thesales. Also betting on speedy approval were the Saudis, whoare seeking to double the size of their army and purchase 24more F-15 fighters, as many as 90 F-18 jets, hundreds of themost modern U.S. tanks and other Navy and communicationsequipment. The Saudis also want to buy at least four moreAwacs long-range surveillance planes, but that request islikely to face less congressional criticism.   The disagreement over weapons sales comes asadministration and Saudi officials said that they worked outthe broad outlines of what could become a permanent,international peacekeeping force expected to be left behindin Kuwait. The force is likely to include about 20,000soldiers from Egypt and Syria, along with some troops underUnited Nations command. The Saudis and Kuwaitis also arebelieved to have agreed in principle to allow the U.S. toleave behind as many as 700 tanks, enough to equip two fullAmerican armored divisions.   Nevertheless, the arms sales issue is certain to cloudU.S.-Saudi relations. Earlier this week, Prince Sultan, theSaudi defense minister, told reporters that the U.S. must&quot;understand our needs and our ambition of trying to maintainthe stability of the region.&quot; While indicating that hisgovernment wants American defense companies &quot;to be the mainsupplier,&quot; Prince Sultan nevertheless warned that the Saudimilitary &quot;will look elsewhere&quot; for weapons if &quot;there arethings that will inhibit the United States from supplyingus.&quot;   The $15-billion package was supposed to complement a $7billion Saudi arms deal Congress approved last year. Saudiofficials agreed to divide their overall request into twoinstallments, with the understanding that the second partwould be acted on shortly after the fighting in the Gulfended.   But now, that plan has been dashed. Congressionalsupporters of Israel oppose much of the proposed Saudi armssale, and other lawmakers have signaled their opposition tothe full Saudi request on the ground that it would damage thecredibility of U.S. efforts to control arms proliferation inthe region.</TEXT></DOC>
