 How can online queries be controlled to maintainthe integrity of the data?andP;  How can such media as CD-ROM be adopted forinformation dissemination without prejudice to those who do not have thecapability of using such media?andP;  And who is to pay for such electronic dataand how much?andM;These and other questions will be dealt with at an Oct. 30 conference onelectronic data interchange in Washington, to be sponsored by GovernmentComputer News.andP;  The same questions also are of concern to the U.S.andO;Commission on Libraries and Information Science, which has approved a &quot;billof rights for the information age.&quot;andM;Information Bill of RightsandM;The commission, a permanent, independent agency of the federal government,adopted the bill of rights following a year of research, analysis andmeetings, including two heavily attended public hearings.andP;  The manifesto isbased on the concept that &quot;public information is information owned by thepeople and held in trust by the government&quot; and that the people must have&quot;open and uninhibited access&quot; to public information.andM;Here are the commission's Principles of Public Information, accompanied by anoccasional amplifying comment:andM;* &quot;The public has the right of access to public information.&quot;andP;  Governmentagencies should guarantee open, timely and uninhibited access to publicinformation except where restricted by law.andP;  People should be able to accesspublic information regardless of its format, without any special training orexpertise.andM;* &quot;The federal government should guarantee the integrity and preservation ofpublic information, regardless of its format.&quot;andP;  By maintaining publicinformation in the face of changing times and technologies, governmentagencies assure the government's accountability and the accessibility of thegovernment's business to the public.andM;* &quot;The federal government should guarantee the dissemination, reproductionand redistribution of information.&quot;andP;  Any restriction of dissemination or anyother function dealing with public information must be strictly defined mylaw.andM;* &quot;The federal government should safeguard the privacy of persons who use orrequest information, as well as persons about whom information exists ingovernment records.&quot;andM;* &quot;The federal government should ensure a wide diversity of sources ofaccess, private as well as governmental, to public information.&quot;andP;  Althoughsources of access may change over time and because of advances in technology,government agencies have an obligation to the public to encourage diversity.andM;* &quot;The federal government should not allow cost to obstruct the people'saccess to public information.&quot;andP;  Costs incurred by creating, collecting andprocessing information for the government's own purposes should not be passedon to people who wish to make use of public information.andM;* &quot;The federal government should ensure that information about governmentinformation is easily available and in a single index accessible in a varietyof formats.&quot;andP;  The government index of public information should be inaddition to inventories of information kept within individual governmentagencies.andM;* &quot;The federal government should guarantee the public's access to publicinformation, regardless of where they live and work, through nationalnetworks and programs like the Depository Library Program.&quot;andP;  Governmentagencies should periodically review such programs as well as the emergingtechnology to ensure that access to public information remains inexpensiveand convenient.andM;In its concluding statement, the commission urges all concerned to apply theprinciples &quot;in the creation, use, dissemination and preservation of publicinformation.&quot;andM;Some of the particulars of the bill of rights seem impractical or overstated.andO;The first item, for example, seems to overstate the case for public access byruling out any special training on expertise.andP;  Should not one be required tobe &quot;computer literate&quot; to access an electronic database, just as one must beable to read in order to peruse a government document?andM;Tortured HistoryandM;With respect to the penultimate item, a tortured history of failed effortshas plagued the idea of setting up a governmentwide index, and no clearlydemonstrable or justifiable need has been indicated for creating an index ordirectory at other than the individual agency level.andM;Similarly, regarding the last item, it is not immediately obvious that a&quot;national network&quot; is essential, or even the preferred way to guaranteepublic access.andM;These are, however, relatively minor objections.andP;  Though its language maylack the elegance of the Constitution, it is hard to disagree with thecommission's overall conclusion that this bill of rights &quot;will serve the bestinterests of the nation and the people in the information age.&quot;andM;It would be nice to see this documented posted on the wall of everygovernment data center, including those in the military, law enforcement andintelligence agencies.andM;Robert V.
