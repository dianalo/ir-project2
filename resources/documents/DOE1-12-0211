The molecule of I contains a cubanelike Cr{sub 4}S{sub4} skeleton, which is deformed as a consequence of the drawing togetherof the Cr atoms by the metal-metal bonds to form a tetrahedral cluster.The methyl-cyclopentadienyl ligands coordinate the vertices of the Cr{sub4} tetrahedron as eta{sup 5} ligands. Cluster I contains 60 valence electronsin the four Cr atoms, in agreement with the rule of the effective atomicnumber. Each Cr atom achieves the electronic configuration of an inertgas by forming three two-center two-electron metal-metal bonds with theremaining Cr atoms.</TEXT></DOC>
