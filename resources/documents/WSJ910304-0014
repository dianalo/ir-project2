The dollar finished Friday in Tokyo at 134.25 yen, up from133.03 yen in New York late Thursday and sharply above 131.95yen in Tokyo Thursday.

London shares were lifted into positive territory at theclose of choppy dealings Friday by a late-afternoon flurry ofbuying in equity futures.   The market is developing two strongly opposing views onthe near-term outlook for shares, which produced the nervousgyrations between negative and positive territory Friday.   One camp argues that the market has rallied too much, toosoon and needs to ease 50-100 points on the broad-basedFinancial Times-Stock Exchange 100-index to achieve acomfortable level that would prevent a sharp retrenchmentlater.   The other maintains that 2350.0 for the 100-index is acomfortable floor and the market has considerable scope forgains.   &quot;That's why the market is so nervous and constantlymoving,&quot; commented one trader.   The broad-based FT-SE 100-share index ended up 6.0 pointsat 2386.9.   The narrower FT 30-share index was up 7.5 points at1918.2.

Traders also noted &quot;good&quot; support from institutionsFriday, suggesting hefty twoway trade that generates profitsfor market makers.   There weren't any major corporate results or economicindicators Friday and the market ended mixed.
