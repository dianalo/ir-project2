Between Jan. 1, 1987, and Sept. 30, 1988, for example, anybody who switched once a month -- and always guessed right -- could have achieved a 95% gain.    Nobody gets it right all the time. But customers who followed the asset-allocation advice of the 10 largest retail brokerage firms haven't done badly. Over the 21-month period, they achieved an average return of 18%, according to a study by The Wall Street Journal and Wilshire Associates of Santa Monica, Calif. At the same time, people who stuck with a standard middle-of-the-road blend (55% stocks, 35% bonds and 10% cash) made about 16%.    Investors who listened to PaineWebber Inc., which apparently gave the best advice among this group, would have made about 22%. PaineWebber did three big things right: It advised cutting back stock holdings to 6% of portfolios before the 1987 crash; it jumped back into stocks right after the crash; and more recently, it bet heavily on bonds.    Those who followed the advice of bottom-ranked Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc., which lately has recommended mostly stocks and cash, made about 11%.    What about people who put all their eggs in one basket? Sticking with stocks through their ups and downs would have produced a 19% gain for the 21-month period. Bonds provided a 9% return; cash, meaning low-risk short-term investments such as Treasury bills or money market funds, produced 10%.    Bonds were the best performers among the three classes of assets last quarter, and the three brokerage houses that had the best allocation record for the past 12 months apparently expect that to continue. They are urging investors to stuff their portfolios with bonds. Most of the other houses are betting on a comeback for stocks.    Asset allocation is the art of distributing an investor's funds among stocks, bonds and other investments to achieve good returns while limiting risk. Many professional investors call it the most valuable skill in investing, more important than picking the right individual stocks. But many also caution that frequent switching of allocations amounts to an attempt to time the markets -- a notoriously difficult task.    The following is a rundown on how each of the firms fared in the study and what they're recommending now:   PAINEWEBBER: PaineWebber, which claims in its advertising to be &quot;the leader in asset allocation,&quot; is living up to its boast, at least for now. It led for the full 21-month period as well as for the most recent 12 months and the latest quarter.    &quot;The key here is that we follow a disciplined -- I triple underline the word 'disciplined' -- approach to asset allocation,&quot; says Edward Kerschner, chief market strategist. &quot;We reduce exposure to an asset as prices rise, and we increase exposure as they fall. There's no emotion.&quot;    Because bonds have increased in price, Mr. Kerschner is cutting back on them a bit. &quot;Cash might not be king, but it sure looks like a prince,&quot; he says. Bonds, however, &quot;still claim the throne.&quot;    PaineWebber's allocation model assumes that stocks in the long run will appreciate about as rapidly as dividends grow. It figures that stocks are worth their extra risk only if they are expected to outperform bonds by about 2.5 percentage points or more a year.    Right now, PaineWebber advises investors to keep only 22% of their assets in stocks, the lowest percentage recommended by any of the 10 firms. Mr. Kerschner says he doesn't think the stock market can rise much unless bonds show good gains first. Meanwhile, he says, as a bond investor, &quot;I'm clipping 9% for sitting on my hands.&quot;    A.G. EDWARDS: A strong commitment to bonds hurt A.G. Edwards andamp; Sons Inc.'s performance before the crash but has generally helped it since. For the past quarter and 12 months, Edwards ranked second.    Chief economist Raymond Worseck currently recommends putting twice as much money in bonds as in stocks. He expects the economy to slow gradually, making interest rates decline and bonds rise. (Prices of existing bonds rise when rates decline, because the bonds' interest payments then look generous compared with those on new investments.)    But Mr. Worseck is worried about &quot;one more blip {upward} in interest rates&quot; and about the federal budget deficit, no matter who wins the election. &quot;My guess is we'll have a government in 1989 that doesn't work very well,&quot; he says.    MERRILL LYNCH: Charles Clough, chief investment strategist for Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., hasn't changed his recommended blend (45% bonds, 40% stocks, 15% cash) since May. &quot;We've made the public statement&quot; that interest rates will come down &quot;within the next 12 to 18 months,&quot; he says. &quot;In the meantime, you're paid to wait.&quot; He likes Treasury bonds and interest-sensitive stocks such as property and casualty insurers or natural gas distributors.    SHEARSON LEHMAN HUTTON: Over the full 21 months, Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. ranked second. In the more recent months, though, its showing has been only average. Chief investment strategist Michael Sherman expects the economy to keep chugging along, averting a recession but not overheating. Thus, he is maintaining an &quot;optimistic&quot; investment posture, recommending a 60% commitment to stocks and only 5% in cash. The stocks to buy, he says, are basic-industry issues, especially exporters.    SMITH BARNEY: Sticking with a fairly cautious approach (50% stocks, 35% bonds, 15% cash), Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. hasn't changed its blend since May 18. When stock and bond prices are oscillating within fairly narrow bands, &quot;It doesn't pay to swing asset allocation around,&quot; says William W. Helman, director of economic and investment policy. &quot;All you do is get whipsawed.&quot; Mr. Helman says he doesn't usually advise so much cash but is doing so because he remains concerned that interest rates could rise in the short term. The stocks Smith Barney currently likes are mostly ones with fat dividends, such as utilities and oil companies.    DEAN WITTER: Performance &quot;over a whole cycle&quot; is what counts, says Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. market strategist John Connolly. Dean Witter was among the leaders for the 21 months but not for the most recent 12-month and three-month periods.    Mr. Connolly is more optimistic about stocks than most, with a 71% stock weighting. His recommended cash position, only 4%, is the smallest of the 10 firms. And his bond allocation is only 25%, Mr. Connolly says, because bonds have already &quot;rallied very sharply.&quot; The stocks he likes include savings and loan associations, regional banks, financial conglomerates and health care issues.    KIDDER PEABODY: Until the end of the past quarter, Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. was clinging to a 50% cash position like a survivor clutching a life raft. Recently, Kidder told investors they could redeploy that cash. The bond allocation was increased to 45% from 10% and the stock allotment to 45% from 40%. &quot;We believe we are at or near a peak in long bond rates,&quot; says research director R. Joseph Fuchs.    Kidder was in the bottom half of the rankings for the 12 months and the 21 months but near the middle last quarter. Its skimpy commitment to stocks hurt it in the 1987 bull market and the first quarter of 1988 but helped it in the crash and in the most recent quarter.    DREXEL BURNHAM: Abby Cohen, investment policy analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., takes pride in having told investors to jump back into stocks immediately after the crash. But Drexel's advice to institutional clients never goes beyond 60% in stocks.    Drexel hasn't been keen on bonds because it thinks the economy will remain stronger than expected and interest rates may rise. &quot;Our underweighting in the bond area hurt us,&quot; Ms. Cohen says, but she's not changing now. If Drexel is right and no recession arrives until 1990, the coming year could be &quot;very positive for stock prices,&quot; she says.    THOMSON MCKINNON: Thomson McKinnon ranked at or near the bottom for all three periods. Brian Fabbri, Thomson's chief economist, has been emphasizing stocks and cash and de-emphasizing bonds -- in retrospect, a mistake for most of the past year. He says the stock market appears already to have built in the expectation of an election victory by George Bush. Even if the vice president wins, Mr. Fabbri expects a dull market in both stocks and bonds -- hence his large (40%) cash position. Mr. Fabbri says he thinks long-term investors can begin accumulating some government bonds but says there's no rush; he expects rates to shoot up well above 9%.    PRUDENTIAL-BACHE: Staunchly committed to stocks, Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. ranked last for the past 12 months because of the crash. For the 21 months, it ranked fourth; loyalty to stocks looks smarter when viewed over a longer time.    &quot;I was probably optimistic going into the crash,&quot; says Greg Smith, chief market strategist. &quot;But, maybe to my credit, I didn't give up the ghost after the crash. Stocks have performed pretty well in 1988.&quot; As Mr. Smith points out, his year-to-date performance (up 8.2%) isn't bad. He predicts gains for both stocks and bonds in 1989 but bigger gains for stocks.    ---                Searching for the Perfect Mix    Estimated performance of investments on the basis of asset-allocation recommendations of 10 major brokerage housesover periods ended Sept. 30, 1988.
