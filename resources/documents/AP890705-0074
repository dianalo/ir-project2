North today drew a three-yearsuspended prison term and a $150,000 fine for his role in theIran-Contra affair. ``You're not the fall guy,'' the judge said insentencing the former White House aide.   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell placed the former NationalSecurity Council assistant on two years' probation and ordered himto perform 1,200 hours of community service administering a newprogram to help inner-city youth avoid involvement in drugs.   Gesell cited North's distinguished career as a Marine officerbefore he became a staff member at the White House during the Reaganadministration.   He told North that during the Iran-Contra affair ``I don't thinkyou were a leader at all.'' He said North was ``really a low-rankingsubordinate who was carrying out the instructions of a few cynicalsuperiors.''   North, who has said he will appeal his conviction on threecounts, had faced a maximum of 10 years' imprisonment and finestotaling $750,000.   In pre-sentencing remarks, North denied the prosecution'scontention that he lacked remorse, saying, ``I grieve for what hashappened and I truly regret it every day.''   Speaking in a soft voice, North said he had served his countryfor 20 years. ``I would never knowingly do anything to hurt it orits institutions. I have made many mistakes. I have been convictedof serious crimes,'' he said.   Pronouncing sentence, Gesell told North:   ``Along the way you came to accept the mistaken view thatCongress couldn't be trusted ... that the fate of the country couldbe left to a small inside group not elected that was free to act asthey chose while publicly professing to act differently.''   But Gesell said that even though North was following orders,``you're not the fall guy for this tragic breach of the publictrust.''   The judge told North that ``I believe you still lack a fullunderstanding of how the public service has been tarnished'' by hisactivities. But Gesell added, ``Jail would only harden yourmisconceptions.''   Gesell also barred North from holding federal office.   The Navy said it was suspending payment of North's $23,000 MarineCorps pension immediately but was asking the congressional GeneralAccounting Office for legal authority to restore it.   North, his lawyers, his minister and other members of hisentourage left the courthouse through a side door. He made nocomment to the crowd waiting outside.   A group of supporters yelled, ``Pardon North now'' as North wasdroven off in a van.   John Keker, North's chief prosecutor, refused to speak withreporters after the sentencing, driving away immediately.   Keker's boss, independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh, who hadsought a prison term for North, issued a terse statement saying:``Sentencing is uniquely a matter for the judgment of the trialjudge. We had a full opportunity to present our views. We have nofurther comment.''   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said PresidentBush had no comment on the sentencing, noting the case was headedfor an appeal. As for a presidential pardon for North, Fitzwatersaid, ``We haven't discussed a pardon. There's been no discussion.It hasn't ever been discussed.''   Mark Weinberg, spokesman for former President Reagan, declinedcomment on the sentence.   Denise Anderson, forewoman of the jury that convicted North inMay, told CBS News: ``Yes, I think it was a fair sentence. As amatter of fact, I'm so happy I can hardly talk. I've been prayingfor this.''   North and his attorney urged the judge to consider the sufferingthe former presidential aide has already endured because ofextensive publicity surrounding the case and the continued threat ofassassination by a terrorist group led by Abu Nidal.   ``I ask only that you consider these things when you weigh thesentence,'' North said. Noting the disruption of his family's life,North asked that ``you be lenient so that they may have a chance torebuild their lives.''   North remained at the defense table for a few minutes afterGesell concluded the sentencing. He then walked over to his wife,Betsy, who was sitting in the front row, kissed her on the cheek andwhispered in her ear. The two then smiled broadly.   The 45-year-old retired Marine lieutenant colonel was foundguilty May 4 of aiding and abetting the obstruction of Congress byhelping write a false chronology of a 1985 arms shipment to Iran. Healso was convicted of destroying sensitive government documents andaccepting a $13,800 home security system from arms dealer Richard V.Secord.   Gesell imposed a three-year suspended sentence on North foraiding and abetting the obstruction of Congress, placed him on twoyears' probation and fined him $100,000.   The judge gave North a two-year suspended sentence and a $35,000fine for destroying or altering government documents. He alsoimposed a one-year suspended sentence and a $15,000 fine foraccepting an illegal gratuity from Secord, whose Iran-Contra trialis pending.   In describing the community service he ordered, Gesell said hehoped North would become ``conscious of certain values you and yourassociates appear to have overlooked in the elite isolation of theWhite House.''   Gesell said the community service would take advantage of North'sconsiderable administrative and organizational skills. He directedthat North perform 800 hours on the project the first year and 400during the second year of the probationary period.   North testified at his trial that he had acted at the directionof his superiors, including then-President Reagan. Defense attorneyBrendan V. Sullivan Jr. argued against imprisoning his client.   But independent counsel Walsh recommended a prison term forNorth, arguing in court pleadings that the former National SecurityCouncil aide lied at his trial and has shown no remorse for hiscrimes.   The defense team led by Sullivan said in court papers that theprosecution's request for imprisonment ``demonstrates that it willstop at nothing in its effort to crush Oliver North.''   The defense said Walsh had not presented ``a shred of support''to the accusation that North lied to win acquittal of a charge hepocketed $4,300 in travelers' checks entrusted to him by Contraleader Adolfo Calero.   ``We urge the court to reject the (prosecutor's) efforts toobtain a prison sentence by smearing Oliver North,'' the defensesaid in a brief filed Monday.   In its sentencing memo, the defense said that sending North toprison would only encourage high government officials to letsubordinates take the blame for ``legally or politically risky''ventures.   The defense cited North's heroism as a platoon leader during theVietnam War and his efforts to free U.S. hostages when he worked atthe National Security Council. It urged Gesell to ``give this recordof service great weight in choosing the appropriate sentence forOliver North.   ``A sentence of imprisonment would be cruel and unjust,'' thedefense said. ``Such a sentence would be deeply and fundamentallyunfair.''   North, during six days of testimony at his trial, said hisefforts secretly replaced those of the CIA when Congress barred theagency from helping the Nicaraguan rebels.   ``I was not stepping in ... I was brought in ... Basically, itwas a handoff _ you've got the ball, now run with it,'' he testified.   North admitted to jurors that he lied to Congress by denying hewas helping the Contras.   ``I was raised to know the difference between right and wrong,''North told the jury. ``I knew it wasn't right not to tell the truthon those things, but I didn't think it was unlawful.''   North was acquitted of nine other charges, including allegationshe lied to Congress by denying he was covertly helping the rebels.   Following the verdict, North said he would ``fight _ and fighthard _ for as long as it takes to prevail'' in the courts on appeal.   Since his conviction, North has continued to appear on thelecture circuit, reportedly being paid $25,000 an appearance.</TEXT></DOC>
