 There are, for example, no rumoursof a 50MHZ 80386 chip to match the 50MHz 68030 processor just announced byMotorola, and there are some indications that 33MHz is as fast as the 80386will go.andP;  if this is the case, then the launch of the 80486 at the same timeas the new 80386, and the emphasis put on the 80486's place in the 80386family, makes good sense for Intel.andP;  if PC manufacturers want higher speeds,the argument goes, then they should switch to the new improved member of thefamily.andM;There are several facets to this argument, though.andP;  First, is the question ofdemand for higher-speed PCs from users who, despite the undeniable advantagesof the fastest 80386 machines, are still buying 80286- based systems in largenumbers.andP;  Secondly, is the amount of work involved in designing and buddingnew PCs based around a brand-new processor design, which is completelydifferent from the 80386 in hardware terms, although it'ssoftware-compatible.andP;  Third, is the question of the speed of the expansionbus, which is still pegged at 8MHz even in 33MHz PCs, and the speed ofstorage and peripheral devices using this bus for their controller hardware.andO;The 8MHz AT-compatible expansion bus performance will lag further behindprocessor and memory speeds as 33MHz and 40MHZ 80486 processors becomeavailable.andM;At present, the manufacturers can cope with these problems as far as the33MHz 80386 is concerned.andP;  The first isn't really a problem at afl.andP;  just asa surprising number of people bought the first 16MHz 80386's from Com- paqand ALR to have machines running twice as fast as an 8MHz AT, so the demandfor 33MHz Ks, which double that 16MHz performance, will inevitably outstripsupply.andM;The second is more serious.andP;  Designing 80386 motherboards and casings hasbecome more difficult as processor speeds have improved, mainly becausehigher clock speeds produce higher levels of electromagnetic interferenceboth inside and outside systems.andP;  The positioning of circuitry and connectingtracks on circuit boards starts to become more crucial to ensure trouble-freeoperation at high speeds.andP;  it's not enough to plug a 33MHz processor andcrystal oscillator into a 16MHz board and expect it to work reliably.andM;However, those manufacturers which are developing new 2 5MHz circuit boardswith a view to faster speeds in the future, such as Compaq, Olivetti, andEverex, should have no difficulty in moving to 33MHz.andP;  IBM has switched tousing processor daughterboards on its fastest PS/2 Model 70s, and it shouldbe able to produce a 33MHz machine at short notice.andP;  If anyone had 33MHz80386 chips before the field, it was IBM and, judging by the quality of the25MHZ design of the Model 70-A21, a 33MHz Model 70 shouldn't be a problem.andM;With this in mind, the prospect of building an 80486-based PC shouldn't betoo daunting, particularly as the processor's initial clock speed is the same25MHz as the current 80386.andP;  The peripheral problem, however, isunsurmountable for those manufacturers who don't want to license IBM's MicroChannel Architecture, and the arrival of the 80486 will only make thingsworse.andM;The major difficulty is the need to support existing AT-compatible expansionboards, since it would be unreasonable to build a machine with AT-compatibleslots and then forbid users to plug their boards into it.andP;  As a result, mostmanufacturers run the processor, memory, and cache con- troller section oftheir Ks at the full processor clock speed, but cut the speed for theexpansion bus.andM;So, while memory access can run at 33MHz with zero wait-states using cacheRAM, access to bus devices has to be run at 8MHz with many waitstates.andP;  Asthe 80486 gains its performance benefits, not by increasing the basic clockspeed, but by using 'internal parallelism' to increase overall throughput,keeping the processor's parallel operating units supplied with data from RAMwill be a problem at 33MHz.andP;  Supplying it from bus devices will benightmarish.andM;EISA doesn't solve this, since it's also shackled by its need for backwardcompatibility with the 8MHZ AT bus.andP;  Today, only MCA - which rumours suggesthas been tested UP to 100MHz in IBM's labs - holds out prospects ofintelligent and fast expansion boards that can match the throughput potentialof the 8o486.andM;Users should take a look at the new crop of 33MHZ 80386-based Ks, and perhapsbook a space for one in a museum of their choice.andP;  They could represent thelast flowering of the old AT architecture, and indeed the last incarnation ofthe 80386.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
