In this alternate conjugational pathway gameticpronuclei are exchanged between conjugants but do not fuse. Each pronucleusundergoes one mitotic division to produce a new macro- and micronucleus.Genetic consequences of pronuclear fusion failure include the following:(1) the progeny are whole genome homozygotes with nuclei derived fromsingle meiotic products, and (2) half of the progeny are heterokaryonswith micro- and macronuclei of different genetic origins. These factsmake this process extremely useful in strain construction and mutantisolation. The induction of pronuclear fusion failure by vinblastinesuggests that microtubules play an essential role in pronuclear fusion.In this paper the authors present autoradiographic and genetic evidencethat vinblastine induces pronuclear fusion failure in T. thermophila.</TEXT></DOC>
