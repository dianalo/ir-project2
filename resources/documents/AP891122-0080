The wording of the brief statement from the official news agencyADN appeared to indicate that the growing opposition movement wouldbe included at the proposed ``round-table'' talks.   ADN did not specify a date for the talks.   It was one of the Communists' most significant concessions tothe opposition in the current unrest.   Leader Egon Krenz is clearly concerned that even though he hasallowed free travel and opened the Berlin Wall, huge crowds arestill demanding further political reforms such as those under wayin Poland and Hungary.   The ``round-table'' format was used in Poland to help bringabout the Solidarity-led government there. It was not clear whetherthe East German Politburo intends to follow the same format.   According to ADN, the Politburo presented the proposal ``for thepolitical parties united in the government coalition to meet at around table with other political forces in the country.''   The ``other political forces'' appeared to refer to theindepenedent pro-democracy groups that have mushroomed in recentweeks. The smaller established political parties already are partof the government coalition.   ``There (at the talks) the ideas about a new elections law, theimplementation of free, democratic elections and a reform of theConstitution could be discussed,'' the ADN dispatch said.   Parliament already is considering a change to rid theConstitution of the Communist monopoly on power. Free electionshave been promised for next year or 1991.   Earlier today, Krenz said the party remains vital to thecountry's future.   Krenz, who faces an early challenge to his leadership at a partycongress next month, also indicated today that he intends to stayin his post.   Speaking at a factory, Krenz said the party will keep its gripon the nation's factories _ a traditional source of local control _and won't let itself be pushed ``up against the wall'' by thegrowing oppostion, ADN said.   Krenz is likely to have to fight for his job when the specialparty congress meets Dec. 15-17, with power to redefine Communistpolicy and to choose a new leadership. Krenz has been party chiefsince Oct. 18.   ``I didn't take over to push for change just for four weeks,''Krenz told workers in East Berlin, according to ADN.   Krenz said the party congress must address the question ofresponsibility for the current situation, but cautioned against``pre-judgment.'' A parliament committee already is weighingpossible criminal charges against Krenz's predecessor, ErichHonecker, and his inner circle.   West Germany's mass-circulation Bild newspaper said today thatGuenter Mittag, Honecker's former right-hand man and economy czar,was questioned for 14 hours last week. It said investigators wantto find out in which Swiss bank accounts the secret police andCommunist Party hid ``hundreds of millions of (West German) marks.''   East Germany's Liberal Democrats, long allied with theCommunists, have been leading calls for an end to the Communistmonopoly on power.   The party's No. 2 official, Hans-Dieter Raspe, told ADN theLiberal Democrats are proposing to put one of their members into arevised presidential post as head of state.   At present, Krenz holds the post of head of state as well asparty chief. His title as head of state is Chairman of the Councilof State. That post would be abolished under the Liberal Democrats'plan.   Manfred Gerlach, who heads the Liberal Democrats, said at hisfirst open news conference today that the government shouldrecognize democratic movements like the New Forum group and allowthem to compete with established parties.   Krenz has come under bitter attack from the growing oppositionmovement, as well as by the government-controlled National Zeitungnewspaper.   The National Zeitung said people do not believe Krenz will carryout reforms, many of which he has discussed in careful generalities.   The critics have stressed Krenz's role as a member of Honecker'sold guard, his support for the Chinese crackdown on thepro-democracy movement in June, and his alleged involvment inelection fraud.</TEXT></DOC>
