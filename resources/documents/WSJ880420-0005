The dial-a-porn ban is expected to be approved by the Senate and signed by the president, but yesterday's action almost certainly presages a court fight. The ban outlaws obscene and indecent speech over the telephone, but constitutional lawyers have argued that the First Amendment protects indecent speech.    The provision could force telephone companies to alter plans to give dial-a-porn services a separate telephone exchange and allow consumers to block calls from their home to that exchange. A House Democratic aide said such plans might now be outlawed because the phone company would be allowing customers to dial banned services.    Thomas Moulton, a vice president for Pacific Telesis Group, a San Francisco-based telephone company, said the ban would only apply to interstate calls -- a very small portion of the dial-a-porn business. He said his company would probably block any calls to dial-a-porn services from out of state.    But a Republican House aide said the bill is written in such a way that it would ban all dial-a-porn services and may be interpreted to cover intrastate calls. The reach of the bill will probably have to be decided by the courts. </TEXT></DOC>
