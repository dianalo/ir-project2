The law outlaws surrogacy whenever money changes hands and makes surrogacy brokers subject to five years in prison and $5,000 fines.    The lawsuit filed yesterdayin Wayne County Circuit Court challenges the surrogacy law's constitutionality and seeks a hearing on a request to prevent it from taking effect Sept. 1, said Howard Simon, executive director of the ACLU's Michigan chapter. Three infertile couples, who are surrogate parents to children conceived under contract, and two surrogate mothers agreed to be anonymous plaintiffs, Mr. Simon said.    &quot;If we lose there is a chance this will be the end of surrogacy,&quot; Mr. Simon said, predicting bills like that enacted in Michigan would be introduced in other states.    State Sen. Connie Binsfeld, a former Michigan mother of the year who led the fight to enact Michigan's law, said her goal was to put Noel Keane of Dearborn, one of the nation's most prolific surrogacy matchmakers, out of business.    By Mr. Keane's count he has been responsible for 238 surrogate births since 1978. Forty more surrogate babies are on the way, he said Wednesday. Mr. Keane isn't a party in the suit.    Mr. Keane typically collects $10,000 from a couple he connects with a woman willing to be artificially inseminated, carry a child to term and then give up custody. He handles the contract and arranges the inseminations.    Mr. Simon said the lawsuit would challenge the constitutionality of the law establishing felony penalties for people who enter into surrogacy agreements.    &quot;This is sex discrimination,&quot; he said, pointing out the inconsistency of laws that permit an infertile man to arrange a pregnancy through a sperm donor but deny the same right to an infertile woman.    &quot;We are dealing with the most fundamental rights that people have -- rights involving the decision to have children,&quot; Mr. Simon said. &quot;There is no justification for the state with its huge hand to come in and criminalize those decisions.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
