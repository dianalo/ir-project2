(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>THE QUESTION that we get asked most these days is not whether Unix as anandM;operating system will be successful, but whether commercial Unix is or is notandM;real.andP;  Are real data processing managers seriously considering Unix? Are theyandM;implementing it? If so, why? Are they boldly venturing forth because theyhave &quot;seen the light&quot;? Have they suddenlyandM;become disillusioned with proprietary systems? Just what is goingandM;on outandM;there?andM;Methodology To get a sense of commercial Unix in the real world,andM;we surveyedandM;approximately 100 commercial users of computer systems.andP;  In two differentandM;surveys, we asked a variety of questions to determine just what dataandM;processing managers are thinking and planning to do about implementing openandM;systems and Unix in their organizations.andM;The first survey solicited information from traditional, IBM-dominated dataandM;processing organizations that have not necessarily indicated any interest inandM;Unix.andP;  They were asked questions ranging from &quot;Is the meaning of the termandM;'open systems' clear to you?&quot; to &quot;Do you expect open computing standards toandM;raise, reduce, or not change the cost per seat in your organization?&quot; TheandM;first group of respondents were culled from medium and large companies (atandM;least 1,000 employees).andP;  They tend to employ more than 10,000 people andandM;represent a variety of industries, ranging from government to insurance/andM;financial services and real estate to manufacturing and medical.andP;  We'll referandM;to this group as &quot;Traditional MIS.&quot;andM;We also surveyed another group of users, those who attended the recentandM;Executive UniForum Symposium.andP;  We asked them a series of questions related toandM;the acceptance of Unix in their organizations, including issues such as  WhatandM;do you see as the major stumbling blocks on the road to commercial Unix?&quot; andandM;Which of the following [list of] graphical user interface characteristics aremost valuable to you?&quot; TheseandM;users differ from the Traditional MIS group in that they chose to attend aandM;commercialandM;Unix seminar.andP;  Therefore, they either have already begun to implementandM;commercialandM;Unix or are taking a hard look at    Unix option.andP;  FromandM;now on, we'll call this group &quot;Unix Aware MIS&quot;andM;In addition to gathering statistics about commercialandM;Unix, we also talked directly to a cross-section of commercialandM;dataandM;processing managers.andM;We interviewed not only those who are already convinced that Unix is wonder- ful, but also those who have no interest and those who plan to  implementUnix only sporadically in their organizations.andP;  What Are Open Systems,Anyway?andM;Even though 66 percent of the respondents stated that they understood theandM;term &quot;Open systems&quot;, their interpretations varied widely.andP;  To some, IBM's MVSandM;operating system is open.andP;  To others, Digital's DECnet operating system is anandM;open system.andP;  The biggest winner in the Open System sweepstakes was MSDOS,andM;which 24 percent of respondents felt was open.andM;In the survey, the Traditional MIS managers were asked if the term &quot;openandM;systems&quot; was clear.andP;  Although 66 percent answered yes, there seemed to be aandM;disparity over what die term &quot;open&quot;  meant.andP;  To some Traditional MISmanagers,andM;it meant IBM's SAA (Systems Application Architecture).andP;  To others, it meantandM;Digital's VMS.andP;  Still others interpreted open systems to mean the DOSoperatingandM;system.andP;  Some understood open systems to be related only to communicationsandM;standards.andP;  Those anticipating that there is indeed commercial interest inUnixandM;will be heartened to know that 18 percent of these respondents consideredUnixandM;to be an Open System.andP;  Unix came in second-after MS-DOS.andP;  Interestingly, OS/2andM;was a big loser, with less than 1 percent of the Traditional MIS managersandM;stating that it was an open standard.andP;  Fifteen percent considered SQL open.andM;Networking technology considered open by Traditional MIS managers includedandM;X.25 by 18 percent, 802.3 by 15 percent, 802.5 by 16 percent, and X.400 by 13andM;percent.andP;  These selections are not surprising, since 802.3 (Ethernet), 802.5andM;(Token-Ring), and X.400 are all part of the Open Systems Interconnect (OSI)andM;standards protocol stack.andP;  If OSI isn't seen as open, what would be?andM;Many traditional MIS Managers are content with a one-or two-vendoandM;r strategy.andM;They tend to implement safe systems, like IBM mainframes andandM;DigitalandM;mid-range systems.andP;  Therefore, they are not frustrated in their attempts toandM;get the software they need.andM;What is the significance of so many different interpretations of &quot;openandM;systems&quot;? First, these MIS managers apparently view openness from theandM;perspectives of their own organizations.andP;  In other words, if theirdepartmentsandM;are &quot;true blue,&quot; with IBM mainframes, mid-range systems, and PCs, and if theyandM;are relatively happy with the situation, managers will tend to see IBM's SAAandM;as open.andP;  After all, the third-party software packages they rely on are quiteandM;often ported to various IBM operating systems.andP;  Therefore, they are lessandM;frustrated by a lack of software options.andP;  They are also less likely to beandM;considering a move from one hardware vendor to another.andP;  Their traditionalandM;orientation has been to rely on a one- or two-vendor environment, which hasandM;proven to be a safe path over the past 20 years.andM;What Makes Unix and Open Systems Attractive?andM;The Open Systems movement and the Unix operating systems are beginning toandM;have a profound impact on data processing organizations.andP;  Even those MISandM;managers who are not currently interested in Unix or open systems areandM;beginning to appreciate some of the benefits of an open systemsandM;environment-especially in the area of applications portability.andP;  We wonderedwhat aspect of open systemsandM;was      makingandM;Unix Aware users take a hard look at Unix.andP;  To find out, we asked which ofthe following reasons was most important to them:andM;*  Hardware independenceandM;*  Operating system independenceandM;* Applications portabilityandM;* Binary compatibility betweenandM;Unix systemsandM;*  Availability of a large library of applications for UnixandM;*  Consistent graphical user interface for different Unix systemsandM;*  A single standard Unix versionandM;*  Database portabilityandM;*  A single standard for SQLandM;*  OtherandM;It was clear from the responses that all of these factors areandM;almost equally important to Unix Aware users.andP;  Each factor received no moreandM;than 12 percent of the total, and no factor received less than 10 percent.andM;The two factors that received 12 percent were applications portability andandM;the availability of a large library of Unix applications.andP;  The three factorsandM;receiving 11 percent were a consistent graphical user interface for differentandM;Unix systems, database portability, and a single standard for SQL.andP;  Given allandM;debates over which version of Unix should become the standard, it wasandM;somewhat surprising that a single standard Unix version was not at the top ofandM;these users' wish lists.andP;  But, at another level, the top vote-getters madeandM;perfect sense.andP;  If Unix is to gain popularity in the commercial sector, aandM;large portfolio of applications must be available and must also be portable.andM;Because the percentages were so close, it is hard to draw too manyandM;conclusions.andP;  But a common theme emerges from the four top vote-gettersandM;(applications portability, the availability of applications, user interfaceandM;across different Unix systems, database portability and a single SQLandM;standard): Unix Aware users are looking for lots of applications that areindependent ofandM;the hardware environment.andP;  Therefore, one conclusionandM;that can be drawn is that users who select Unix as a deliberateandM;strategyandM;(rather than because of price or the availability of a particularandM;application) do so because of theandM;freedom it offers.andM;A similar question was askedandM;of the TraditionalandM;MIS managers:andM;WhatandM;are the mostandM;important benefits of standardsandM;today, and what will beandM;the benefit of open systems?&quot;andM;The followingandM;six items were the options:andM;*  Applications portabilityandM;*  Reduced training effortandM;*  Vendor-independent purchasingandM;*  Streamlined system developmentandM;*  Higher performance/lowerandM;costandM;*  Simplified interfaces betweenandM;systemsandM;*  OtherandM;Despite the fact that vendorsandM;of Unix systems try to promote vendor independence as a keyandM;benefit,andM;Traditional MIS users didn't seeandM;this factor as a key purchase criterion.andP;  It was rated as important by onlyandM;13 percent,andM;sixth on the list.andP;  Applications portability was fifth, with 15andM;percent.andP;  Three factors were rated as equally important: ReducedandM;training effort, streamlined system development andandM;simplified interfaces each received 17 percent.andP;  Interestingly,andM;these three are the top issues that data processing organizationsandM;deal with on a day-to-day basis.andP;  Therefore, it is encouragingandM;that Unix is viewed as strong in these key areas.andM;If there is a single issue that is driving data processingandM;organizations to seriously examine Unix, it is the development environment.andO;AandM;move from one operating system to another requires incredible systemsandM;development and training efforts.andP;  We were somewhat puzzled by the managers'andM;emphasis on a simplified interface.andP;  One explanation could be that theyandM;perceive that, under Unix, developers deal with fewer different interfacesthan do data processing professionals, who must deal with severalandM;different operating systems at once.andM;Traditional MIS managers were also asked to rate these same options for aandM;future time when there are true &quot;open system standards.&quot; Under this proposedandM;scenario, the emphasis changed.andP;  Applications portability became the topandM;vote-getter (18 percent of the total).andP;  Vendor-independent purchasing rosefromandM;sixth to second place (17 percent).andP;  Streamlined systems development andandM;reduced traning fell a little, each receiving a 16 percent vote.andP;  Again, theandM;percentages in this category are close.andM;The highest percentage that any category received was 18 percent, and theandM;lowest was 14 percent.andP;  Clearly, these are all important issues.andP;  But wethinkandM;that the subtle shifts in position from the &quot;today state&quot; to the &quot;opensystemsandM;state&quot; are significantandM;We can look at this shift from two perspectives.andP;  First, if we put on ourandM;&quot;Unix evangelist&quot; hat, it means Traditional MIS users understand that, onceandM;open systems are achieved, they will attain true applications portability.andM;Second, if we put on our cynic's hat, this shift in emphasis could representandM;an idealized view of open systems.andP;  In other words, when everything isandM;open,&quot; all the problems of traditional systems development will go away.andO;ThisandM;shift could also mean that the messages Unix vendors have been giving theandM;industry are beginning to have an impact.andP;  Even the Traditional MIS folks seeandM;open systems as beneficial.andM;An aside: It was interesting to read the questionnaires submitted byandM;traditional data processing managers who are deeply committed to theirexisting data processing environment (i.e.,andM;mainframes running MVS).andP;  These respondents tended to protest strongly byandM;giving Unix questions as low a score as possible.andP;  They often wrotestatementsandM;like &quot;We have no intention of implementing any Unix.&quot; Logically, theiranswersandM;to other questions, such as whether standards cost more or less, indicatedandM;their extreme position.andP;  Single-Vendor Standards versus Open StandardsandM;Traditional MIS managers stated that single-vendor standards were extremelyandM;important to their organizations and would continue to increase over theandM;next three years.andP;  These centralized MIS organizations require a moreandM;homogeneous environment to cope with maintenance issues.andP;  On the other hand,andM;these same managers also foresaw that their organizations would increasinglyandM;implement open systems over the next three years.andM;Just how important is it for MIS organizations to have a single-vendorandM;standard? How important is an open system? We took a look at these issuesoverandM;time.andP;  We asked users how important it was today, and how important it wouldbeandM;in 12 months and in 36 months.andP;  Our objective was to spot a trend.andM;First, we asked Traditional MIS managers to indicate how important aandM;single-vendor standard such as MVS would be between now and the next threeyears.andP;  Twenty-six percent ofandM;the users felt that a single-vendor environment was importantandM;today and for the next 12 months.andP;  However, 30 percent felt that, in 36andM;months,andM;the single-vendor standard would actually increase.andM;Does this mean that more Traditional MIS managersandM;will remain loyal to one vendor in the future? NotandM;necessarily.andP;  Remember, these are large, traditionalandM;IBM customers with a huge installed base of IBM mainframes.andP;  The trendandM;upwardsandM;simply indicates that these organizations do not intend to move away fromandM;their main-andM;frame orientation for key corporate databases.andP;  In addition,andM;these respondents represent centralized MIS organizations.andP;  In order toandM;maintain.andM;maximum control, it is far better to have fewer operatingandM;systems and less hardware to maintain.andP;  Therefore,andM;it is easy to understand why these organizations riot onlyandM;desire but strive to support as few different options as possible.andP;  InandM;contrast, individualandM;department managers tend to be less concerned about consistency of acquiredandM;systemsandM;with the installed base of theandM;overall organization andandM;more concerned about price/andM;performance and gaining accessandM;to applications and theandM;development environmentandM;they need.andM;We also asked about theandM;importance of open systems over time.andP;  The answers indicate continuing growthandM;forandM;Unix.andP;  For example, 11 percentandM;of these users felt thatandM;Unix was important today,andM;and 22 percent felt it wouldandM;be important in 12 months.andM;The 11 percent increase isandM;significant for this conservativeandM;group.andP;  Forty-nine percentandM;of users felt that UnixandM;would become important toandM;their organizations withinandM;three years.andM;Does this contradictionandM;make sense? How could MIS managers be committed to aandM;single-vendor standard at this time and to Unix and openandM;systems in the future? One answer is that the pressures to implement UnixandM;systems areandM;coming from externalandM;sources, sometimes beyond the control of the MIS managers.andP;  In some cases,andM;their superiors, taking note of the promised benefits of open systems, areandM;requiring them to plan to implement Unix in the future.andP;  In other cases, suchandM;as U.S.andP;  federal government agencies, these standards are becoming a systemsandM;requirement In still other cases, in order to remain competitive, theseandM;managers feel that they need to anticipate future systems directions.andP;  TheandM;fact that MIS-sanctioned companies like IBM and Digital are making loudnoisesandM;about Unix has made these managers begin to take Unix seriously for the firstandM;time.andP;  Some are taking these steps reluctantly.andP;  Others view Unix as more cost-effective than OS/2 because, in the words of one of these managers, &quot;at least Unix is also multiuser.&quot;andP;  The OSF versus UI QuestionandM;While Unix Aware users are interested in the goings-on between UI and OSF,andM;they are not as concerned as one might think with a merger of the twoandM;groups.andP;  They are much more concerned about issues such as a common APIandM;between different versions of Unix.andM;How important is it to Unix Aware users that OSF (Open Software Foundation)andM;and UI (Unix International) merge? We expected that, given the intensity ofandM;the battles between the two factions, these users would want to see quickandM;resolution.andP;  However, it was not so simple.andP;  Only 30 percent of therespondentsandM;said that they wanted the two groups to merge.andP;  The remainder either did notandM;want a merger or did not care.andP;  Why? We suspect that the element ofcompetitionandM;has suggested to many users that better technology will result.andP;  Many alsoandM;infer that, since both groups promise to conform to X/Open CommonApplicationsandM;Environment (CAE) and the Posix specification, their differences will beandM;minor.andP;  What is much more important to users, especially those writingandM;applications, is a common Applications Programming Interface (API), whichwillandM;allow their applications to run under different versions of Unix withandM;different user interfaces without rewriting.andM;Graphical User InterfaceandM;The problem of multiple and incompatible user interfaces within Unix isandM;perceived as a bigger problem by software developers than by end users.andP;  TheandM;software developers that we talked to are concerned and even angry thatandM;vendors are forcing them to write their applications to so many differentuser interfaces.andP;  They hesitate to pick one of the current im-andM;plementations for fear that it might not dominate.andP;  They feel the urgent needandM;for at least a common API.andP;  End users, on the other hand, are less concerned.andM;The Unix Aware MIS managers respondingandM;to a survey at Executive UniForum were given five user interfaceandM;criteria tandM;oandM;rank in order of importance.andP;  The criteria were as follows:andM;* Ability to apply the interface across your company, regardlessandM;of platform.andM;* Ability to tailor the interface to different applicationsandM;* Ability to design a custom user interface for use across yourandM;entire companyandM;* Applications that adapt to the preferred interface conventionsandM;of the various &quot;standard&quot; platforms (e.g., WordPerfect on aandM;Mac and WordPerfect on a PandM;* An industry graphical user interface standard (across operatingandM;systems)andM;* OtherandM;Of these five choices, the most important was the ability toandM;apply the interface across the company, regardless of platform.andM;Of theandM;total of 60 respondents, 19 selected this as their first priority; anotherandM;six users selected it as their second.andP;  Coming in as a close runner-up wasandM;the ability to tailor the interface to different applications (15 selectedandM;this as their first priority; 9 selected it as their second .andP;  Thecombination of these twoandM;answers indicates that Unix Aware users are looking forandM;consistency at all levels.andM;Applications EnvironmentandM;We wondered about the importanceandM;for Unix Aware usersandM;of the newandM;generation ofandM;applications enablers, such asandM;graphical user interface,andM;compound documents, andandM;procedural       automation.andM;Therefore, weandM;asked them to indicate whichandM;of the following featuresandM;were required and whichandM;were desired:    * Compound document/objectandM;architectureandM;* Procedural automationandM;* Scheduling capabilityandM;* Graphical user interfaceandM;* DOS/Unix integrationandM;* OtherandM;Of the six categories, theandM;highest percent of managers (42 percent) voted for sched-andM;uling capability.andP;  Since electronic mail is alreadyandM;well-implemented underandM;Unix, itandM;is understandable that users take advantage of the systemandM;to help schedule meetings.andP;  We were also riot surprisedandM;that DOS/Unix integration was a close second, with 41andM;percent.andP;  One of the secret weapons of Unix-and, weandM;suspect, one of the reasons that it has begun to make inroadsandM;into corporations-is its ability to run DOS applications.andP;  TheandM;third most important requirement, with 40 percent, was graphicalandM;user interface.andP;  Over the next year, we suspect that a commonandM;API set will supplant the actual user interface as the keyandM;issue.andP;  For application developers, a common API is the singleandM;most important issue.andM;Procedural automation (35 percent) and compound document/objectandM;architecture (24 percent) were less important to users.andP;  This can beandM;attributed to the fact that most vendors have not yet implemented theseandM;technologies in their systems.andP;  This is supported by the responses of anotherandM;41 percent of the users that compound document/object architecture wasandM;desirable and responses of an additional 29 percent that they wantedandM;procedural automation for their applications.andM;In the &quot;other&quot; category, users wrote in fourth-generation languages,andM;electronic mail, ODA/ODEF/MO:DCA, system and network administration menus forandM;easier use, network support, network management and remote diagnostics, andandM;SNA and X.400 integration.andM;Wish ListandM;We wanted to know what would help Unix Aware users feel more comfortable withandM;commercial Unix.andP;  Therefore, we asked,  What is the one thing vendors coulddoandM;for you today that would cause you to buy more Unix systems?&quot; Three areasandM;kept reappearing: better and easier-to-use system administration management,andM;better and more applications, and better interoperability with existingandM;non-Unix applications.andP;  Over and over again, these users compared the UnixandM;and DOS environments.andP;  They wanted the same applications and the sameandM;level of software innovation that they have found in DOS to migrate to Unix.andM;We thought some of the answers were worth repeating:andM;TOPIC:        System Administration and Management Comment:      &quot;BandM;ring theandM;common foundation which is promisedandM;by Unix to the marketplace.andP;

 These software housesandM;would specialize in porting applications fromandM;aging systems to Unix-based platforms, preservingandM;external communications requirements.&quot;andM;Comment:     &quot;Create common Graphical User Interfaces soandM;different systems behave/appear similarly (toughandM;for a Unix vendor to answer!).&quot;andM;We decided to ask a number of traditional MISandM;respondents why some were so adamantly opposedandM;to Unix in the commercial environment andandM;why others were planning to implement someandM;commercial Unix over the next three years.andP;  WeandM;provide here some key statements that reveal  importanandM;tandM;criteria.andP;  &quot;We are beginning to look at Unix, particularly Sun machinesbecause they are competitively priced.andP;  We have found a lot ofandM;support in the Sun environment third-party products.andM;One appealing thing for us is portability.andP;  But users don'tandM;use an operating system; they use applications like databases.&quot;andM;&quot;We have no interest in Unix.andP;  There is no need.andP;  We willandM;have anything that counts under OS/2.andP;  We have a fewandM;copies of OS/2 in-house.andP;  Down the road, we are planning to use OS/2 insteadandM;ofandM;DOS.&quot;andP;  &quot;We're not using Unix andandM;I'm not a great admirer of Unix, but it's inevitable.andM;Unix has the advantage of networking.&quot;andM;Impressions To take the pulse of commercial Unix, we began talkinandM;gandM;to managers in a variety of data processing organizations, not necessarilyandM;thoseandM;companies on the leading edge of technology.andP;  WhileandM;our sample isn't statistically valid (we have talked to approximately 25), weandM;did notice some interesting trends.andM;The enthusiasm about open systems and Unix rangedandM;from enthusiasm  usually about one aspect) to hostility.andP;  One data processingandM;managerandM;felt that Unix was inevitable, so he'd have to implement it sooner or later.andM;But he wasn't very happy about the pros-andM;pect Another manager didn't like Unix because the namesandM;given to its commands seemed elusive.andP;  Yet anotherandM;manager stated emphatically that he was riot interested in Unix.andP;  Why? HisandM;organizationandM;had only IBM mainframes and PCs, and portability was not an issue discussedandM;in his organization.andM;And, as for those users who are beginning to implement some Unix, mostandM;areandM;not making philosophical decisions, but decisionsandM;based on price.andM;It is becoming increasinglyandM;clear to us that commercial Unix will not emergeandM;from the traditional data processing organization.andM;Much in the same way that the minicomputer and microcomputer revolutionandM;started--in departments of large companies and in smallandM;mercial Unix emerge from these sources as well.andP;  Why? Traditional dataandM;processing organizations are often caught up in the ever-increasing backlogandM;of requests.andP;  These organizations are often too worried about their politicalandM;survival to take a chance with something as risky as Unix and open systems.andO;There are,  of course, exceptions.andP;  In some traditional organizations,mavericks may appear  who suddenly discover the importance of impendingchange-whether it is DOS, a  minicomputer for local processing, Unix, ordistributed network computing.andP;  They often become obsessed with the need tomove the organizationandM;to a new plateau, and they are willing to put their careers onandM;the line.andM;Mavericks can often do the impossible-take a traditional,andM;slow-moving dataandM;processing organization and make it move.andP;  The Need For EducationandM;If Unix is to become an acceptable commercial operating system, vendorsandM;have their work cut out for them.andP;  It is not enough to  preach to theandM;converted.&quot; Vendors have to reach out to the masses of computer users whoandM;are skeptical about the value of Unix and the notion of applicationsandM;portability.andP;  Most commercial information systems managers have heard ofandM;Unix and open systems, but their primary source is the publicity about theandM;creation of the Open Software Foundation and Unix International and theandM;infighting within the Unix community.andP;  They have little or no knowledgeandM;about the Unix development environment, the applications available, or theandM;improvements being planned.andM;Most typical commercial end users do not believe that thereandM;are manyandM;Unix applications they would be interested in.andP;  It will take aandM;concerted and planned effort on the part of major  software and hardwarevendors to get the message across that Unix is becoming a  commercialoperating system.andP;  Vendors will have to encourage third-party  developers towrite creative and innovative applications for Unix.andP;  Next, they  must helpdevelopers promote these applications to the commercial information  systemsworld.andP;  If Unix vendors would spend as much time promoting arid  developingcommercial Unix applications as they have fighting the wars over  control ofUnix, the results of this survey might have been more overwhelmingly positive.andM;The research presented in this issue of Unix in the Office is an excerptandM;from a special report,  Taking the Pulse of Commercial Unix.&quot; This specialandM;report provides additional information on such issues as future spending onandM;Unix over the next 36 months.andP;  If you are a subscriber to Unix in the Office,andM;you can receive this special report for $95-$100 off the regular price ofandM;$195.andP;  To take advantage of this offer, call us at 1-800-826-2424 (in Mass.,andM;call 617-742-5200).andP;            @@@07527292X 0UIOHEa002AWASandM;AROUND HERE, we like to talk about Distributed NetworkandM;Computing (DN.andP;  We get excited by the notionsandM;that aU the computing power in a company-whether it isandM;PCs, servers, or mainframes-becomesandM;one virtualandM;computer and that parts ofandM;applications can be parceledandM;out to different processors onandM;the network.andP;  And it looks asandM;if the industry is actually making some progress in DNC.andP;  NowandM;that Hewlett-Packard has acquired Apollo, it will be able to implementandM;Apollo's sophisticated Network Computing SystemandM;(NCS) a year earlier than originally planned.andP;  Digital EquipmentandM;and Apollo continue to make progress extending NCS byandM;adding wide area networking facilities.andP;  In addition, the OpenandM;Software Foundation (OSF) has issued a new Request forandM;Technology (RFT) for DNC.andM;All this is good news.andP;  DNC is indeed the next-generationandM;model for distributed computing and offers incredible potential.andM;However,andM;one thought keeps nagging at me: security.andP;  When a system is based onandM;centralized processing, security is more controllable.andP;  Once centralizedandM;control disappears, maintaining secure systems becomes a major headache.andO;WhenandM;files are spread across processors across a vast network, how do you ensureandM;that an unauthorized individual never gains access?andP;  When Remote ProcedureandM;Calls (RPCS) are flying around a network, how do you guarantee that access toandM;files and data is secure?andM;It is interesting that, as X-Window grows in popularity, secuandM;rity is oneandM;of the sorely neglected issues.andP;  At the recent Xhibition in SanandM;Jose,andM;California, developers spoke about the problem of security in X. MoreandM;disturbing is the fact that security is not a key issue for standardsandM;organizations for next year, either.andM;Some in the industry have suggested that Unix and security arandM;e strangeandM;bedfellows.andP;  Traditionally, developers liked the Unix environmentandM;because itandM;was so easy to access just about anything.andP;  You could test out anyandM;circumstance without bumping into roadblocks imposed by more secure operatingandM;environments.andM;Now that Unix is moving,andM;albeit slowly, from the development arena to theandM;commercial MIS environment, security is bound toandM;take center stage.andP;  Developers, however, may take exceptionandM;to losing their free and open environment, andandM;commercial users will not be satisfied with openness.andP;  ThisandM;dichotomy is a snapshot ofandM;the Unix industry.andP;  How do you keep a technology that works just fine for oneandM;group (i.e., developers) and, at the same time, add all the constraints andandM;controls necessary for the other group (MIS)? It is an interesting problem,andM;and one that will not be solved easily.andP;  For instance, will the developer beandM;willing to give up the superuser ID? Will the MIS manager stand for such aandM;concept?andM;Security is a high hurdle for Unix as it moves out of the lab into theandM;office.andP;  Without attention to this issue, Unix will never make it to primeandM;time.andP;  One ray of hope-security was the hot topic at this year's UsenixandM;conference.andP;  Remember that, two years ago, the most widely debated topic wasandM;user interface.andM;One possible solution that has been suggested is the use of kerberos.andP;  ThisandM;technology, developed for Project Athena at MIT, requires that a system firstandM;send to a node an encrypted message that the user on the receiving end wouldandM;decipher and answer.andP;  This mechanism is also part of Carnegie Mellon's AndrewandM;File System.andM;The problems of distributed networking and Unix are only beginning toandM;surface.andP;  They will become even more difficult once object orientationbecomesandM;more prevalent.andP;  Because object-oriented systems imply the use ofinheritance,andM;a developer might use an object that has pointers back to historical data.andM;How will users of object-oriented applications make sure that secure dataandM;remains secure and does not accidentally become part of an inheritedandM;characteristic of an object?andM;These are the problems that the Unix industry will have to address-andandM;quickly.andP;  Sometimes, it is too easy to become excited about the promise ofnewandM;technology.andP;  We forget to pay attention to the details that make it work intheandM;commercial world.andP;  @@@075273101 0UIOHEa013LRRFandM;Now that the dust has settled over Motif, OSF (Open Software Foundation)andM;has released another RFT (request for technology), this time for aandM;distributed computing component.andP;  With the resultant technology, OSF wantsandM;to create a vendor-independent networking and distributed computingandM;environment to support distributed applications.andP;  OSF has a number ofandM;objectives here, including:andM;A single, reliable, consistent environment for both users and applicationandM;developersandM;Hardware-, device-, and operating system-independence Tools for easyandM;systems administrationandM;Portability and scalabilityandM;The RFT includes RPC (remoteandM;procedure call), naming, authentication, and presentationandM;services, as wellandM;as a distributed file system.andP;  In addition, OSF is welcoming technologiesandM;beyond these core services-technologies thatandM;aspire to improve DNC (distributed network computing) under Unix, likeandM;transaction processing.andP;  However, candidates don't have to do it all.andP;  TheyandM;could, for instance, just submit an RPC mechanism.andP;  Therefore, the OSFandM;distributed computing environment selection will look a lot like its userandM;interface selection-a mix and match solution, made up from the various RFTandM;submissions.andP;  This is really a good way to go.andP;  Not only is the resultingandM;technology comprised of the best components, but it's more diplomatic.andM;REQUIREMENTS AND EVALUATION.andP;  Although candidates need not offer each DNCandM;component, they each must meet a number of requirements:andM;Candidate technologies must conform to Posix standards and be written in C.andM;Portability is essential.andP;  OSF wants a number of different machines to beableandM;to play in its environment.andP;  Furthermore, submissions that demand OSF1 kernelandM;modifications should take a modular approach.andP;  All submissions must be readyandM;for commercial shipment in the first half of 1990.andM;Validation and testing.andM;Documentation (including architectural overview, specifications, interfaceandM;reference, programmer's guide, and user's guide) must accompany allandM;submissions.andM;Obviously, candidates must be willing to license their wares to OSF.andM;Above and beyond these requirements, OSF will evaluate each candidateandM;technology according to the richness of its features and its extensibility,andM;ease of use and administration, performance, reliability and security,andM;transparency, technical maturity, interoperability, and conformance to OSIandM;protocols.andM;SCHEDULE OF EVENTS.andP;  OSF is wasting no time.andP;  Letters of intent are due July28,andM;and candidates have until October 6 to submit their proposals.andP;  Next willcomeandM;the semifinals.andP;  Those in the running will have to present their material toanandM;OSF Members' Technology Review Meeting in November.andP;  After an evaluation teamandM;examines the final round of technologies (the date has not been given yet),andM;OSF will announce its selections.andM;CONCLUSION.andP;  We think OSF is choosing the right path with its decision toandM;incorporate an open distributed computing component.andP;  Better DNC solu-andM;tions are vital to the growth of Unix as a commercial system.andP;  The commonUnixandM;communication mechanisms (e.g., pipes, sockets, signals) aren't the mostandM;efficient ways to answer the demands of distributed applications, so aandM;standard RPC is a good idea.andP;  In fact, the development of anindustry-standardandM;RPC is the root of Digital Equipment's involvement with Apollo.andP;  (AlthoughandM;Hewlett-Packard purchased Apollo, the RPC work with Digital is on-going.)andM;Interestingly, IBM has also licensed NCS technology.andP;  Hand-in-hand with theandM;RPC is security, which has recently become an especially critical area.andM;Thus, we'll be eyeing security segments keenly.andM;However, the distributed computing selection may be somewhatandM;moreandM;problematic for OSF than was its user interface selection.andP;  There was noclearandM;standard Unix user interface, but NFS (Network File System) from Sun is a deandM;facto standard.andP;  This doesn't mean that NFS offers the best solutions.andP;  ItandM;doesn't.andP;  For example, Apollo's NCS (Network Computing System) and CMU's AFSandM;are very credible systems, and are, in many ways, better than NFS.andP;  All theandM;same, given NFS's status in the community, OSF can't ignore it-in fact mustandM;support it-whether or not NFS is included in the final selection.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
