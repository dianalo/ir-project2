The 40 traders from the two exchanges are expected to beindicted this week on charges of racketeering or mail or wirefraud, and could face sentences of 30 to 38 months in prison ifconvicted, the Chicago Sun-Times reported.   The government team, headed by Paul Coffey, the Washington-baseddeputy chief of the Justice Department's organized crime andracketeering sections, also is threatening traders with loss oftheir seats on the exchanges and confiscation of their homes, carsand other possessions, the Sun-Times said.   The government team proposed a deal to defense lawyers duringweekend meetings that the traders plead guilty to alleged illegaltrades and cooperate with prosecutors, the newspaper reported.   But the newspaper said lawyers for the traders and brokersrejected the government offer. While no specific promises weremade, the implication was that the defendants would get bettertreatment if they cooperated, the newspaper said.   Some defense attorneys said their clients would make restitutionfor the alleged illegal trades, but the offers were turned down,the newspaper reported. The report said other lawyers offered tohave their clients plead guilty to misdemeanors, but the governmentinsisted on felony charges.   A felony conviction could bar a trader from returning to thefloor.   A 2{-year investigation in the case involved undercover federalagents placed in the Merc and CBOT. Armed with concealedmicrophones, the agents focused on ``the swaggering types,'' andpeople who displayed extravagant lifestyles, an unidentified sourcetold the newspaper.   U.S. District Judge John F. Grady ruled Friday that tapes madeby agents could be used in the prosecution. The recordings tookplace in the exchanges, bars, restaurants and even restrooms,sources told the newspaper.</TEXT></DOC>
