These surveysassess whether the operation of nuclear-powered warships, during construction,maintenance, overhaul, or refueling, have created elevated levels ofradioactivity. The surveys emphasize sampling those areas and pathwaysthat could expose the public. In 1984, NAVSEA requested that all activefacilities servicing nuclear-powered warships be resurveyed over thenext three years. Kings Bay Submarine Support Facility (KBSSF), locatedadjacent to St. Marys, Georgia and approximately 10 miles east of Kingsland,Georgia, was surveyed by EERF personnel in August 1985. The KBSSF hasnot been previously surveyed by the EERF or its predecessor (the US PublicHealth Service) since the area had not been visited by nuclear-poweredwarships until approximately 1980. 2 refs., 3 figs., 4 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
