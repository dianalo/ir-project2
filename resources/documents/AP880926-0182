The vote by a show of hands at the party's first annualconference in this north England resort upset some members of theold Liberal Party who wanted the short title Liberal Democrats, toinclude their former party's historic name.   The Social and Liberal Democratic Party was formed last Marchfrom a merger of the long-established Liberal Party and most of the7-year-old Social Democratic Party. David Owen, the SocialDemocratic leader, refused to join and is a leading a separatefaction.   Legislator Sir Russell Johnston, a former Liberal, saidexcluding Liberal from the short title was ``extraordinary folly.''   ``For me, the world Democrat simply has no clear politicalmeaning,'' he said.   He said the new short title implied that Britain's two majorparties, the governing Conservatives and opposition Labor Party,``are not democrats.'' ``They are,'' added Johnston.   The new parties obtained 20 percent of the vote in an electoralalliance at the last general election in 1987.   But the acrimonious merger slashed support. A Harris pollpublished Sunday in the liberal Observer newspaper showed theDemocrats with eight percent support and Owen's faction with fivepercent.   The Liberal Party dates to the 1840s and was one of Britain'stwo major parties until Labor supplanted it in the 1920s.</TEXT></DOC>
