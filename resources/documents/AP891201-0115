Eighty-five percent of the union workers approved the contractin voting that began Monday and ended early Friday. The workersplanned to return to work Monday.   ``We are very pleased,'' said Nynex spokesman John Bonomo. ``Thesettlement is fair for everyone _ customers, employees andshareholders. We're looking forward to welcoming all our employeesback to work on Monday, and dedicating ourselves to providing thequality service our customers rely on us for.''   In August, workers staged walkouts against four of the Baby Bellcompanies formed in the break-up of ATandamp;T _ Nynex, Pacific Telesis,Ameritech and Bell Atlantic. All except Nynex were back at work bythe end of the month.   At Nynex, the CWA's 40,000 regional members struck subsidiaryNew York Telephone on Aug. 6. They were joined at New EnglandTelephone by 20,000 members of the International Brotherhood ofElectrical Workers.   A Nynex spokesman did not immediately return a telephone messageseeking comment.   The rancorous strike left one striker dead after a picket lineconfrontation and the telephone companies with a backlog on newinstallations.   The major issue concerned the company's insistence that workersshare part of their health costs. The final settlement did notinclude any health-cost sharing.   The IBEW settled first; its workers returned to work more thantwo weeks ago. The CWA reached a tentative agreement on Nov. 22.However, negotiations with two constituent groups continued untilWednesday, Master said.</TEXT></DOC>
