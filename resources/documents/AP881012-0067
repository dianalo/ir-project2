(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Highly radioactive waste from the SavannahRiver Plant will be shipped to New Mexico under a project beingreviewed by the U.S. Energy Department, the agency says.   A proposed facility at the nuclear weapons plant would preparethe waste for shipment starting next year to the department's WasteIsolation Pilot Plant near Carlsbad, N.M., according to anenvironmental assessment by the agency issued Monday.   The New Mexico plant would eventually remove a potential sourceof groundwater contamination from Savannah River: thousands ofcubic feet of stored waste containing elements heavier thanuranium, which are called ``transuranic.''   Plutonium, manufactured at Savannah River for use in nuclearweapons, is a transuranic element.   The three nuclear weapons reactors at the plant near Aiken havebeen closed for maintenance and safety checks amid a wave ofpublicity about lax safety precautions.   Savannah River is one of 14 sites that generate or storetransuranic wastes in nuclear weapons work and that will ship themto New Mexico.   The New Mexico plant is a research facility designed todemonstrate the safe and environmentally acceptable disposal ofradioactive defense waste, the report said.   The Savannah River facility would analyze, compact and solidifynewly generated waste.   By 1995, when Savannah River is to start retrieving previouslystored waste for shipment, a projected 370,000 cubic feet of storedtransuranic waste will have accumulated there, the EnergyDepartment report says. Waste is stored in containers and trenchesat the plant.   Starting in 1995, the report said, Savannah River's facilitywould ship away 15,000 cubic feet of retrieved waste per year, andexport new waste as fast as it accumulates, at a projected rate of6,200 cubic feet per year.   The New Mexico project, which has itself drawn criticism fromenvironmentalists, will not end the South Carolina plant'senvironmental woes.   A report issued this week by Congress' General Accounting Officenotes that hazardous but non-radioactive wastes also haveaccumulated at numerous sites around the plant. Some reportsestimate the total cost of cleaning up the plant at $6.5 billion.   In addition, the transuranic project does not include wasteburied before 1970. The Energy Department decided the environmentalbenefits were not worth the risks of unearthing the waste, thereport suggested.</TEXT></DOC>
