Terms weren't disclosed. The two U.S. companies produce and market a wide range of respective branded healthfood products and operate delicatessens in the Midwest and Southwest U.S.    Wessanen has said that it wants to expand internationally, notably in the U.S., where the company already derives about 35% of its 3.7 billion guilders ($1.74 billion) a year in world-wide sales.    Dutch foods and consumer-products groups, such as Wessanen, retailers Ahold N.V. and Vendex International N.V. and Unilever N.V., have built up a very large presence in the U.S. in recent years, given limited growth prospects in the Netherlands and Europe.    Wessanen said Gourmet Foods and Award Foods have combined annual sales of about $60 million and together employ 280 workers. </TEXT></DOC>
