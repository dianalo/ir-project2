In Singapore, a new law requires smokers to put out their cigarettes before entering restaurants, department stores and sports centers or face a $250 fine. Discos and private clubs are exempt from the ban, and smoking will be permitted in bars except during meal hours, an official said. Singapore already bans smoking in all theaters, buses, public elevators, hospitals and fast-food restaurants.    In Malaysia, Siti Zaharah Sulaiman, a deputy minister in the prime minister's office, launched a &quot;No-Smoking Week&quot; at the Mara Institute of Technology near Kuala Lumpur and urged other schools to ban on-campus smoking.    South Korea has different concerns. In Seoul, officials began visiting about 26,000 cigarette stalls to remove illegal posters and signboards advertising imported cigarettes. South Korea has opened its market to foreign cigarettes but restricts advertising to designated places.    HONG KONG MATERIALISM    A marketing study indicates that Hong Kong consumers are the most materialistic in the 14 major markets where the survey was carried out. The study by the Backer Spielvogel Bates ad agency also found that the colony's consumers feel more pressured than those in any of the other surveyed markets, which include the U.S. and Japan. The survey found that nearly half of Hong Kong consumers espouse what it identified as materialistic values, compared with about one-third in Japan and the U.S. More than three in five said they are under a great deal of stress most of the time, compared with less than one in two U.S. consumers and one in four in Japan.    BANGKOK CONFERENCE CENTER    The Thai cabinet endorsed Finance Minister Pramual Sabhavasu's proposal to build a $19 million conference center for a joint meeting of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund two years from now. The meeting, which is expected to draw 20,000 to Bangkok, was going to be held at the Central Plaza Hotel, but the government balked at the hotel's conditions for undertaking necessary expansion. A major concern about the current plan is whether the new center can be built in such a short time.    THE PLO'S OLYMPIC BID    Yasser Arafat has written to the chairman of the International Olympic Committee asking him to back a Palestinian bid to join the committee, the Palestine Liberation Organization news agency WAFA said. An official of the Palestinian Olympic Committee said the committee first applied for membership in 1979 and renewed its application in August of this year. The PLO in recent months has been trying to join international organizations but failed earlier this year to win membership in the World Health Organization and the World Tourism Organization.    AIDS IN CHINA    A Beijing food-shop assistant has become the first mainland Chinese to get AIDS through sex, the People's Daily said. It said the man, whom it did not name, had been found to have the disease after hospital tests. Once the disease was confirmed, all the man's associates and family were tested, but none have so far been found to have AIDS, the newspaper said. The man had for a long time had &quot;a chaotic sex life,&quot; including relations with foreign men, the newspaper said.    POLAND'S ECONOMY    The Polish government increased home electricity charges by 150% and doubled gas prices. The official news agency PAP said the increases were intended to bring unrealistically low energy charges into line with production costs and compensate for a rise in coal prices. In happier news, South Korea, in establishing diplomatic ties with Poland yesterday, announced $450 million in loans to the financially strapped Warsaw government.    A VICTORY FOR ENVIRONMENTALISTS    In a victory for environmentalists, Hungary's parliament terminated a multibillion-dollar River Danube dam being built by Austrian firms.    The Nagymaros dam was designed to be twinned with another dam, now nearly complete, 100 miles upstream in Czechoslovakia. In ending Hungary's part of the project, Parliament authorized Prime Minister Miklos Nemeth to modify a 1977 agreement with Czechoslovakia, which still wants the dam to be built.    Mr. Nemeth said in parliament that Czechoslovakia and Hungary would suffer environmental damage if the twin dams were built as planned.    Czechoslovakia said in May it could seek $2 billion from Hungary if the twindam contract were broken. The Czech dam can't be operated solely at peak periods without the Nagymaros project.    POSTSCRIPTS . . .    A painting by August Strindberg set a Scandinavian price record when it sold at auction in Stockholm for $2.44 million. &quot;Lighthouse II&quot; was painted in oils by the playwright in 1901 . . . After years of decline, weddings in France showed a 2.2% upturn last year, with 6,000 more couples exchanging rings in 1988 than in the previous year, the national statistics office said. But the number of weddings last year -- 271,124 -- was still well below the 400,000 registered in 1972, the last year of increasing marriages. </TEXT></DOC>
