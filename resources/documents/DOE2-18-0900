Twoenergy carriers will always be required on the secondary side: electricityand a liquid energy carrier, preferably liquid hydrogen. On the primaryenergy side, there are in principle two options: nuclear energy and hardsolar energy. The concept of applying soft solar or other so called alternativesources as dealt with in the current energy discussion (soft versus hardpath) does not solve the supply problem. The soft path is professedlya programme for the industral reorientation of society - with the aimof decentralization. In any event, the use of fossil energy resourcessuch as coal, oil and gas will be neccessary for a considerable transitionperiod of probably more than 100 years. The major problem is today recognizedas the management of emissions from fossil fuels. There are technicalmeasures which can solve this, and it will therefore probably be possibleto prudently apply the carbon atom still for a considerable time. Futureenergy demand must, of course, be assessed in order to analyse futureenergy systems. This is not primarily a technical problem but ratheran economic and social one, involving different conceptions of a desirablefuture.</TEXT></DOC>
