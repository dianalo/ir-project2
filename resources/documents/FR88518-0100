Therequest for amendment was submitted by letter dated March 18, 1988 (ReferenceG02-88-065). The proposed amendment would change Technical Specification section 4.8.2.1,``D.C. Sources Surveillance Requirements.'' Subsection d. of that sectionspecifies the discharge amperage profiles which must be achievable forthe DC batteries to be declared operable. The proposed amendment wouldrevise those discharge amperage profiles. This change is being made becausereview of design documents indicated an inconsistency with the TechnicalSpecifications. Battery load profiles were recalculated to provide therevised values.
