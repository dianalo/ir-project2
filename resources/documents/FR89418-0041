The estimated weighted-average margins are shown in the ``Continuationof Suspension of Liquidation'' section of this notice.<ITAG tagnum="84">Case History</ITAG>On January 26, 1989, we made an affirmative preliminary determination (54FR 5110, February 1, 1989). The following events have occurred since thepublication of that notice.The questionnaire responses from Mitsuboshi Belting (Singapore) Pte. Ltd.(MBS), and its subsidiaries, Mitsuboshi Belting Ltd. of the United States(MBL USA) and Mitsuboshi Belting Ltd. of Canada (MBL Canada), were verifiedin Singapore from February 22-24, 1989, in Calgary, Canada from February13-15, and in Lombard, Illinois from February 16-17, 1989.On March 24, 1989, the Department held a public hearing. Interested partiesalso submitted comments for the record in their pre-hearing briefs of March17, 1989, and in their post-hearing briefs of March 31, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of Investigation</ITAG>The United States has developed a system of tariff classification basedon the international harmonized system of customs nomenclature. On January1, 1989, the U.S. tariff schedules were fully converted to the <T3>Harmonized Tariff Schedule</T3> (HTS), as provided for in section 1201<T3>et seq.</T3> of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988.All merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption onor after that date is now classified solely according to the appropriateHTS subheadings. The HTS numbers are provided for convenience and Customspurposes. The written description remains dispositive.The products covered by this investigation are industrial belts and componentsand parts thereof, whether cured or uncured, provided for under <T3>Tariff Schedules of the United States Annotated</T3> (TSUSA) item numbers358.0210, 358.0290, 358.0610, 358.0690, 358.0800, 358.0900, 358.1100, 358.1400,358.1600, 657.2520, 773.3510, and 773.3520 and currently classifiable underHTS subheadings 3926.90.55, 3926.90.56, 3926.90.57, 3926.90.59, 3926.90.60,4010.10.10, 4010.10.50, 4010.91.11, 4010.91.15, 4010.91.19, 4010.91.50,4010.99.11, 4010.99.15, 4010.99.19, 4010.99.50, 5910.00.10, 5910.00.90,and 7326.20.00.The merchandise covered by this investigation includes certain industrialbelts for power transmission. These include V-belts, synchronous belts,round belts and flat belts, in part or wholly of rubber or plastic, andcontaining textile fiber (including glass fiber) or steel wire, cord orstrand, and whether in endless (i.e., closed loop) belts, or in beltingin lengths or links. This investigation excludes conveyor belts and automotivebelts as well as front engine drive belts found on equipment powered byinternal combustion engines, including trucks, tractors, buses, and lifttrucks.<ITAG tagnum="84">Period of Investigation</ITAG>The period of investigation (POI) is January 1, 1988, through June 30,1988.<ITAG tagnum="84">Such or Similar Comparisons</ITAG>For MBS, pursuant to section 771(16)(C) of the Act, we established onecategory of ``such or similar'' merchandise: V-belts.<ITAG tagnum="84">Fair Value Comparisons</ITAG>To determine whether sales of industrial belts from Singapore to the UnitedStates were made at less than fair value, we compared the United Statesprice to the foreign market value, pursuant to sections 772 and 773 ofthe Act, respectively.<ITAG tagnum="84">United States Price</ITAG>For those sales by MBS that were made through a related sales agent inthe United States to an unrelated purchaser prior to the date of importation,we used purchase price as the basis for determining United States price.For these sales, the Department determined that purchase price was themost appropriate indicator of United States price based on the followingelements:1. The merchandise in question was shipped directly from the manufacturerto the unrelated buyer, without being introduced into the inventory ofthe related selling agent; 2. This was the customary commercial channel for sales of this merchandisebetween the parties involved; and3. The related selling agent located in the United States acted only asthe processor of sales-related documentation and a communication link withthe unrelated U.S. buyers.Where all the above elements are met, we regard the routine selling functionsof the exporter as having been merely relocated geographically from thecountry of exportation to the United States, where the sales agent performsthem. Whether these functions are done in the United States or abroad doesnot change the substance of the transactions or the functions themselves.In instances where merchandise is ordinarily diverted into the relatedU.S. selling agent's inventory, we regard this factor as an important distinctionbecause it is associated with a materially different type of selling activitythan the mere facilitation of a transaction such as occurs on a directshipment to an unrelated U.S. purchaser. In situations where the relatedparty places the merchandise into inventory, additional storage and financialcarrying costs are commonly incurred. We use the inventory test becauseit can be readily understood and applied by respondents who must respondto Department questionnaires in a short period of time.We calculated purchase price based on the packed, c.i.f., duty paid pricesto unrelated purchasers in the United States. We made deductions from thepurchase price, where appropriate, for foreign inland freight, U.S. andforeign brokerage and handling charges, ocean freight, marine insurance,U.S. duty, and U.S. inland freight, pursuant to section 772(d)(2)(A) ofthe Act.For those sales placed into inventory, we based United States price onexporter's sales price (ESP), in accordance with section 772(c) of theAct, since the first sale to an unrelated customer was made after importation.We calculated ESP based on packed, ex-warehouse or delivered, duty-paidprices to unrelated purchasers in the United States. We made deductions,where appropriate, for foreign inland freight, U.S. and foreign brokerageand handling charges, ocean freight, marine insurance, U.S. duty, U.S.inland freight, discounts, rebates, repacking, commissions, credit expenses,and other indirect selling expenses.<ITAG tagnum="84">Foreign Market Value</ITAG>We verified that home market sales of MBS are less than five percent ofits third country sales and have, therefore, selected Canada as the appropriatethird country, in accordance with andSection; 353.5(c) of our regulations.Because MBS is a subsidiary of Mitsuboshi Belting Ltd. of Japan, a producerof such or similar belts, petitioner requested that we invoke the ruleunder section 773(d) of the Act for calculating foreign market value forcertain multinational corporations. The multinational provision allowsforeign market value to be determined by reference to the foreign marketvalue of ``such or similar merchandise'' sold by a related party in a countryother than the country of exportation. Use of the provision requires theDepartment to determine that the following three conditions are met:(1) The production facilities in the country of exportation are owned orcontrolled by a corporation which also owns or controls facilities forthe production of such or similar merchandise located in another countryor countries;(2) Sales of such or similar merchandise in the country of exportationare nonexistent or inadequate as a basis of comparison with sales of themerchandise to the United States;(3) The foreign market value of such or similar merchandise produced inone or more facilities outside the country of exportation is higher thanthe foreign market value of such or similar merchandise produced in facilitiesin the country of exportation.The first two conditions of section 773(d) are met. However, petitioner'sallegation with respect to section 773(d)(3) is deficient. Where Japan-Canadaprice comparisons involved identical merchandise, export prices to Canadawere found to be significantly higher than Japanese home market prices.Where price comparisons involved non-identical merchandise, it was notapparent to the Department from information submitted by the petitionerthat the price comparisons were based on ``similar'' merchandise. For thesereasons, we did not initiate the multinational provision.As stated above, it was determined that Singapore's home market was notviable for comparison purposes. Therefore, in accordance with section 773(a)of the Act, we calculated foreign market value based on delivered, packed,third country (Canada) prices to unrelated purchasers. We made deductions,where appropriate, for Singapore and Canadian inland freight, Singaporeand Canadian brokerage and handling charges, ocean freight, marine insurance,Canadian duty, discounts and rebates.For foreign market value compared with U.S. purchase price we made adjustmentsunder andSection; 325.15 of our regulations for differences in circumstancesof sale for commissions and credit expenses in the U.S. and Canadian markets.For foreign market value compared with ESP, we deducted credit expensesand commissions, in accordance with andSection; 353.15(c). We also deductedindirect selling expenses incurred on third country sales up to the amountof indirect selling expenses incurred on sales in the U.S. market, in accordancewith andSection; 353.15(c) of our regulations.In order to adjust for differences in packing between the two markets,we deducted canadian packing costs from foreign market value and addedU.S. packing costs.<ITAG tagnum="84">Currency Conversion</ITAG>For comparisons involving purchase price transactions, we used the officialexchange rates in effect on the dates of sale, in accordance with andSection;353.56(a)(1) of our regulations. For comparisons involving ESP transactions,we used the official exchange rates in effect on the dates of sale, inaccordance with section 773(a)(1) of the Act, as amended by section 615of the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984. All currency conversions were madeat the rates certified by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.<ITAG tagnum="84">Critical Circumstances</ITAG>Petitioner alleges that ``critical circumstances'' exist with respect toimports of the subject merchandise from Singapore. Section 735(a)(3) ofthe Act provides that critical circumstances exist if we determine that:<ITAG tagnum="21">(A)(i) there is a history of dumping in the United States or elsewhereof the class or kind of merchandise which is the subject of the investigation,or </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) the person by whom, or for whose account, the merchandise wasimported knew or should have known that the exporter was selling the merchandisewhich is the subject of the investigation at less than its fair value,and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(B) there have been massive imports of the class or kind of merchandisewhich is the subject of the investigation over a relatively short period.</ITAG>Pursuant to section 735(a)(3)(B), we generally consider the following factorsin determining whether imports have been massive over a relatively shortperiod of time: (1) The volume and value of the imports; (2) seasonal trends(if applicable); and (3) the share of domestic consumption accounted forby imports.Because the Department's import data pertaining to the subject merchandiseare based on TSUSA basket categories, for purposes of the final determination,we used specific data on shipments of the subject merchandise as the mostappropriate basis for our determination of critical circumstances. Furthermore,we believe that company-specific critical circumstances determinationsbetter fulfill the objective of the critical circumstances provision ofdeterring companies from increasing imports massively prior to the suspensionof liquidation. We asked MBS to supply monthly volume shipment data fromNovember 1987 to January 1989 in order for the Department to base the criticalcircumstances determination on company-specific data. We verified the informationsubmitted by MBS.Based on our analysis of respondent's shipment data, we do not find thatthere have been massive imports of industrial belts from Singapore. Consequently,the requirements of section 735(a)(3)(B) have not been met and criticalcircumstances do not exist with respect to imports of industrial beltsfrom Singapore.<ITAG tagnum="84">Verification </ITAG>We verified the information used in making our final determination in thisinvestigation in accordance with section 776(b) of the Act. We used standardverification procedures, including examination of relevant accounting recordsand original source documents provided by the respondents.<ITAG tagnum="84">Interested Party Comments</ITAG><T3>Comment 1: </T3>Petitioner asserts that the Department discovered asignificant number of discrepancies with the respondent's third-countrydata or problems with the methodologies employed. Therefore, the Departmentshould not utilize respondent's submission, but use best information available.Respondent argues that there is no basis for disallowing corrections todata made during verification. Respondents are required to prepare andsubmit voluminous data in a very short period of time, so the existenceof clerical mistakes in the response can be expected. Respondent arguesthat petitioner's position, that no corrections should be allowed at orsubsequent to verification, would prevent the Department from making afair value determination based on accurate information.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>We agree with respondent. A careful review of pastantidumping cases, <T3>Antifriction Bearings from the FRG </T3>(which has been published inthe <T4>Federal Register</T4>), <T3>Light-Walled Welded Rectangular Carbon Steel Tubing from Argentina</T3>(54 FR 13913, April 6, 1989), <T3>Certain Granite Products from Italy</T3> (53 FR 27187, July 19, 1988),and <T3>Tapered Roller Bearings and Parts Thereof, Finished or Unfinished,from Italy </T3>(52 FR 24198, June 29, 1987) reveals that the facts involvedin this case more closely resemble situations where the Department usedresponses rather than rejecting them due to verification corrections andnew submissions. The minor revisions found at verification did not substantiallyexceed the methodological problems and mathematical errors commonly foundduring other investigations in which the Department used the response forpurposes of the final determination. Furthermore, in both <T3>Antifriction Bearings from the FRG </T3>and <T3>Tapered Roller Bearings and Parts Thereof, Finished or Unfinsihed,from Italy,</T3> certain information contained in the response could notbe supported at verification. This is not the situation in this case. Alldata has been satisfactorily verified using standard verification practicesand techniques.<T3>Comment 2:</T3> Petitioner alleges that based on the company-specificdata submitted by MBS, critical circumstances clearly exist with respectto imports of the subject merchandise from Singapore. Petitioner furtherargues that it has obtained additional evidence that MBL is increasingits U.S. inventory levels of industrial belts. Hence, for purposes of thefinal determination, the Department should render an affirmative criticalcircumstances finding.Respondent argues that, contrary to petitioner's assertions, the factsof this case do not support an affirmative determination regarding criticalcircumstances. Respondent argues that the Department should compare thesix month periods before and after the petition was filed rather than applyingthe three-month periods advocated by petitioner in this case.<T3>DOC Response: </T3>In examining whether critical circumstances exist,it has been the Department's policy in recent cases to apply the principleof capturing shipment data up to the point of the preliminary determination.In this case, the preliminary determination was made in February 1989;therefore, we have compared the period between November 1987-June 1988with the period between July 1988-January 1989. See section on <T3>Critical Circumstances.</T3><T3>Comment 3. </T3>Petitioner argues that the Department should have calculatedforeign market value using the special rule for multinational corporations,19 U.S.C. 1677b(d). Petitioner asserts that contrary to the Department'sfinding in the preliminary determination, it has provided sufficient priceinformation to establish that the foreign market value of MBS Singapore'sbelts sold in Canada is lower than the foreign market value of ``such andsimilar'' merchandise produced and sold by MBL Japan in Japan, as requiredby 19 U.S.C. 1677b(d)(3). Specifically, petitioner argues that the Japan-Canadaprice comparison was based on ``similar'' merchandise. Petitioner statesit has shown that the LA and LB belts sold by MBL in Japan are ``such orsimilar'' to the fractional horse power (FHP) belts (3L, 4L, and 5L) exportedby MBS Singapore to the United States and Canada. Petitioner further arguesthat, in the case of industrial belts from Taiwan, the Department preliminarilydetermined that SM, SA, and SB belts manufactured by Hsing Kwo in Taiwanwere ``similar'' merchandise to FHP belts (3L, 4L, and 5L) exported byHsing Kwo to the U.S. The Department, therefore, should render a consistentdecision in this investigation by concluding MBS's 4L, 5L FHP sold in theU.S. and Canada are ``similar'' to the LA and LB series sold by MBL inJapan. In rendering this decision, the Department must conclude that petitionerhas satisfied the requirements of 19 U.S.C. 1677b(d)(3) by establishingthat MBL's prices for belts sold in Japan were significantly higher thanthe prices for similar belts sold by MBS in Canada.Respondents argue that 3L, 4L, and 5L belts are not ``similar'' to theLA and LB series. Bando's SA and SB series are similar to MBL's LA andLB series belts, and in fact compete in the same end-user market in Japan,<T3>i.e., </T3>agricultural equipment. Furthermore, petitioner stated inthe related investigation of industrial belts from Japan that SA and SBbelts produced in Japan by Bando were not similar to the 3L, 4L and 5Lseries, and, therefore, the petitioner should be bound by its allegations.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>The petitioner has not satified the requirementsof 19 U.S.C. 1677b(d)(3). In the petition a concordance compares the modelsof FHP belts sold in the U.S. by MBL and Bando with those sold by the samecompanies in Japan. While, the petition indicates that the 4L and 5L seriesbelts sold by MBS in the U.S. and Canda are in concordance with the SAand SB belts of Bando and the LA and LB belts of MBL sold in Japan, theDepartment made a preliminary determination that the Japan-Canada pricecomparison was not based on ``similar'' merchandise. Petitioner has failedto provide any new information showing the LA/LB series to be similar tothe 4L/5L series of belts. Specifically, petitioner has failed to explainits inconsistent allegation in the investigation of Japanese industrialbelts, that SA/SB belts are not similar to 4L/5L belts. In addition, petitionerhas failed to refute the claim made by respondent that SA/SB are dissimilarto 4L/5L belts. Therefore, the issue of whether LA/LB and 4L/5L are similarremains unresolved. It is the petitioner's obligation to provide the Departmentwith a reasonable basis to believe that the foreign market value of suchor similar merchandise sold by MBL in Japan are higher than the foreignmarket value of similar merchandise sold by MBS in Canada. The fact thatin the case of industrial belts from Taiwan, the Department made differencesin merchandise adjustments between SM, SA, and SB belts manufactured byHsing Kwo in Taiwan and FHP belts (3L, 4L, and 5L) exported by Hsing Kwoto the U.S. is irrelevant. Petitioner has not supplied information establishingthe comparability of industrial belts between different producers in differentcountries.<T3>Comment 4: </T3>Petitioner argues that 19 U.S.C. 1677b(d) and the legislativehistory do not require the petitioner to produce information pertainingto differences between the cost of merchandise sold in the country of exportationand the merchandise sold outside the country of exportation. Petitionerstates that such adjustments are discretionary and that, in fact, it hasnever alleged that any adjustments should be made. Accordingly, the lackof information with respect to price adjustments for differences in merchandiseor cost of production data does not provide a sufficient basis for theDepartment to refrain from invoking the special statutory rule for multinationalcorporations. Petitioner argues that if the Department believes that suchadjustments are necessary, publicly available information can be utilized.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>Within the context of this proceeding, section 773(d)(3)requires that the foreign market value of such or similar merchandise producedby Mitsuboshi in Japan be higher than the foreign market value of suchor similar merchandise produced in Singapore (and exported to Canada).This requirement is more than just a simple price comparison. A differencebetween Japanese home market prices and export prices to Canada does notimply a difference between the respective foreign market values. If theprice differential is wholly attributable to differences in merchandise,the foreign market values will be equal. Similarly, equal prices do notimply equal foreign market values. Therefore, a comparison of prices unadjustedfor differences in merchandise does not constitute sufficient support foran allegation made with respect to 773(d)(3).<T3>Comment 5: </T3>Petitioner argues that the Department should not makeany adjustments to third country prices with regard to transportation charges,because the reported per unit movement charges are average costs basedon the incorrect allocation of expenses incurred in a prior period. Petitionerargues that in order for the agency to accept the reasonableness of respondent'smethodology, respondent should be required to demonstrate: (1) that oncemerchandise is sold (<T3>i.e., </T3>withdrawn from the U.S. subsidiary's inventory), the subsidiaryhas no means for tracking that particular merchandise back to the pointat which it was received into inventory; and (2) that documentary evidenceexists which shows that expenses of the prior period advocated by the respondentare the expenses that are directly related to the sales under consideration.Respondent argues that what petitioner calls the use of ``historical data''is not ``historical'' at all. Respondent argues that in any investigationof sales of fungible merchandise from an importer's inventory, the useof costs incurred outside the POI is necessary. Since the importer, bydefinition, does not manufacture the merchandise but imports it from aforeign country, in order to have the merchandise on hand for sales frominventory, the importer must have laid the merchandise into inventory ata date which preceded the date of sale. In determining what costs to usefor expenses prior to the sale, the question is, therefore, at what periodwas the merchandise which was sold put into inventory. The best methodfor determining this period is the use of financial accounting records.An examination of MBL Canada's and MBL USA's financial records, performedby the Department at verification, reveals that the average turnover periodfor merchandise put in inventory in both countries is as stated by thecompanies. This methodology has been used consistently on both sides ofthe calculations for out-of-inventory sales in both markets. Respondentargues that the use of data from the period of investigation for the calculationof movement expenses from Singapore to the warehouse would not providedata on the belts sold from inventory on dates during that period. Thetransit time alone from Singapore to warehouse is at least a month andmay be as much as six weeks. The belts must then be added to inventory,where they are treated as being completely fungible with other belts ofthe same description. Such fungible merchandise is completely differentfrom television sets, large machinery, or automobiles which have serialnumbers and may be sold and inventoried on that basis. For merchandisesuch as belts, there is simply no alternative but the first-in-first-outmethod used here. The Department has accepted this methodology before andaccepted it in the preliminary determination in this case and verifiedit. At this point in the investigation, the Department has given respondentsno indication that this methodology is incorrect.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>We agree with respondent. Respondent has not used``historical'' expenses related to past sales as a proxy for expenses relatedto sales during the POI, as is done when estimating warranty expenses.Instead, respondent has reasonably estimated the expenses incurred on beltssold during the POI. Therefore, we are accepting respondent's claimed expensefor our final determination.<T3>Comment 7: </T3>Petitioner argues that any claim for a downward adjustmentto foreign market value for freight-out expenses (freight from MBL Canada'swarehouse to the ultimate end-user) should be rejected because the allocationis based on total inland freight expenses, <T3>i.e., </T3>expenses which are attributable to merchandise outside thescope of the investigation as well as to the sales under consideration.Petitioner asserts that such expenses cannot be tied directly to the merchandisesubject to investigation and, therefore, there is no way to ensure thatthe reported per pound freight expenses are accurately reflective of theactual freight-out expenses on the subject merchandise.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>We disagree. In most cases, when companies manufactureand/or sell more than one product, shipments are usually a mix of manyproducts. It is almost impossible for these companies to segregate freightexpenses of one product from freight expenses of another product in thesame shipment. Thus, their accounting records only reflect total freightexpenses. We verified that this is true for MBS Singapore, MBL USA, andMBL Canada. It is our policy to allow allocations based on total expensesover total sales in these cases.Furthermore, if we disallow the adjustment for the Canadian market, wewould also have to disallow the adjustment for the U.S. market, becausethe accounting records are kept exactly the same way in both countriesand the calculation methodology used for U.S. sales is the same as thatused for Canadian sales. Petitioner has not argued that the adjustmentin the U.S. should be disallowed. <T3>Comment 8:</T3> Petitioner argues that no deduction from foreign marketvalue for cash discounts should be permitted, because verification showsthat in several instances MBS incorrectly reported that the customer tookearly payment discounts even when the customer did not do so. <T3>DOC Position:</T3> We checked all sales made to one customer and foundthat respondent correctly reported the discount given. We also checkedtwelve other sales at random and found that the actual discounts on ninesales were reported correctly. The discounts on two sales were quite abit higher than was reported in the response, and there was one sale onwhich no discount was taken, although respondent reported giving a twopercent discount. Because the misreported discounts were relatively fewin number and involved errors in both directions, we are accepting respondent'sclaim for discounts. <T3>Comment 9:</T3> Petitioner states that the revised short-term borrowingrate submitted by MBL Canada at verification constitutes ``new information''and should be utilized, if at all, only as ``best information otherwiseavailable.'' Moreover, the revised figure itself is based on data derivedfrom the period May 1987 to June 1988 and not during the period of investigation.<T3>International Financial Statistics</T3> show that lending rates inCanada during the POI were, on average, 10.09%. In the absence of periodspecific data, the Department should utilize the IMF data for its finaldetermination. <T3>DOC Response:</T3> We disagree. We verified that the revised short-termborrowing rate submitted is the actual rate paid by MBL Canada. The revisedrate submitted was only slightly different from the estimated rate providedin the response. <T3>Comment 10:</T3> Petitioner argues that the Department should disallowindirect selling expenses and inventory carrying costs for Canadian salesbecause MNBL Canada used expenses related to an earlier period to calculatethese expenses for the POI and because MBL provided revised data, whichis ``new information,'' at verification. Respondent argues that data concerning MBL Canada's indirect selling expenseswere provided to the Department and to petitioner's counsel under AdministrativeProtective Order on January 4, 1989, well in advance of verification. Underthese facts, petitioner is completely wrong in asserting that the informationon MBL Canada's indirect selling expenses submitted at verification amountsto new information. On the contrary, the problems were called to the Department'sattention and the corrected information was presented at the time mostappropriate for its consideration. <T3>DOC Response:</T3> We agree with respondent. We verified that the revisedinformation submitted at vertification was correct. <T3>Comment 11:</T3> Petitioner alleges that MBS did not provide movementcharges related to U.S. sales on a transaction-specific basis. MBS incorrectlycalculated these expenses based on aggregate expenses. Furthermore, MBSmade incorrect assertions with respect to ocean freight and marine insurance.Moreover, certain charges were reported in the wrong currencies, a factwhich undermines the overall credibility of MBS's responses. <T3>DOC Position:</T3> We disagree. We have verified all information regardingmovement charges used in this determination. See also DOC response to Comment7. <T3>Comment 12:</T3> Petitioner claims that MBS reported per unit dutyexpenses on U.S. and Canadian sales using an incorrect methodology. Asbest information available, the DOC should apply the <T3>ad valorem</T3> duty rate listed in the TSUSA schedules to the imputedentered customs value, which would be the gross price less any U.S. movementcharges. <T3>DOC Position:</T3> In the original responses, both MBL USA and MBLCanada calculated duty expenses based on weight. At vertification, we checkedcustoms entry forms and requested that the two companies recalculate theirduty expenses based on entry value for each product. They have done soand provided us with costoms documents upon which these calculations werebased. We have used these recalculated expenses for our final determination.<T3>Comment 13:</T3> Petitioner argues that MBS did not report per unitpacking expenses on transaction-specific charges and that respondent incorrectlyaggregated the packing expenses and derived a POI average. Petitioner arguesthat the Department should apply the highest shipment-specific unit chargeto all U.S. purchase price sales. <T3>DOC Position:</T3> We disagree. We verified that MBS accurately reportedCanadian and U.S. packing costs. <T3>Comment 14:</T3> Petitioner asserts that, for purposes of the finaldetermination, the Department should apply the discount discovered at verificationto the appropriate ESP transactions. <T3>DOC Position:</T3> We have done so. <T3>Comment 15:</T3> Petitioner claims that the Department should applythe cash discount given to several ESP customers which was discovered duringverification to all U.S. purchase price sales as well, since it is unclearfrom the verification report whether such expenses are exclusively relatedto ESP transactions. <T3>DOC Position:</T3> We disagree. We found no indication at verificationin Singapore that the cash discount given by MBL USA to its customers wasgiven by MBS to its direct sale customers. <T3>Comment 16:</T3> Petitioner argues that since the information givenfor commissions paid to the commision agent on direct sales made throughMBL USA is not verified, the Department should use as best informationavailable the highest rate reported in MBS's response. <T3>DOC Response:</T3> We disagree. The statute does not require that weverify all information provided. Since we verified that the commissionspaid by MBS on Canadian purchase price sales were accurate, there is noreason for us to believe that the reported commissions paid by MBS on U.S.purchase price sales are incorrect. <T3>Comment 17:</T3> Petitioner asserts that the transportation expensesfrom MBS to MBL USA are not an accurate reflection of the actual expensesincurred on a transaction-specific basis, because they are based on thederivation of an average costs which have no direct relationship to thesales under consideration. Furthermore, MBS used an aggregate figure whichincluded expenses for automotive as well as industrial belts. <T3>DOC Position:</T3> We disagree. See DOC Position on Comment 7. <T3>Comment 18:</T3> Petitioner argues that all packing expenses on U.S.EPS sales prices should be recalculated on the basis of financial statementfigures. Furthermore, petitioner argues that since the verification teamdid not verify MBS's claim that only a certain percentage of its warehouseworkers' time is spent packing the subject merchandise, the entire portionof those workers' wages and benefits should be included in the U.S. packingexpenses claim. <T3>DOC Position:</T3> The packing expenses on U.S. ESP sales have beenrecalculated on the basis of the financial statement. We disagree with petitioner's argument that, because we did not verifythe percentage of time the warehouse workers spent on packing, we shouldinclude the entire portion of those workers' wages and benefits in theU.S. packing claim. Respondent used the exact same percentage to calculateCanadian packing expenses. At verification in Canada, we visited the warehouseand checked the duty summary to show the variety of tasks performed bywarehouse personnel and determined that forty percent was a reasonableestimate of the time spent by warehouse labor on packing. Because the sametasks are performed by warehouse personnel in the U.S., the forty percentis also a reasonable estimate for the U.S. market. <T3>Comment 19:</T3> Petitioner asserts that during verification MBS providedno source documentation demonstrating that the pre-sale technical serviceexpenses were included in the reported U.S. indirect selling expenses.Because the Department cannot ensure that such expenses have, in fact,been reported, it should increase foreign market value by the amount ofU.S. technical service expenses but make no deduction for any technicalexpenses incurred in the home market. <T3>DOC Position:</T3> We disagree. The travel expenses related to pre-saletechnical service expenses are included in the travel and promotions expensereported in the response. At verification, we found no other technicalservice travel expenses in MBL USA's records. <T3>Comment 20:</T3> Petitioner claims that, even though respondent reportedthat during the period of investigation no warranty expenses were incurred,there is frequently a substantial lag time between the sale of a productand any warranty claims made by the customer. Petitioner claims that MBSshould have submitted warranty expenses related to sales of the productsin each of the five years preceding the period of investigation. SinceMBS did not do so, the Departemnt should use, as best information available,the highest warranty claim reported by respondents in the other antidumpingduty investigations involving industrial belts. <T3>DOC Position:</T3> MBS failed to report historical warranty expensesincurred on merchandise sold to either market. The Department, therefore,utilized the best information available. The Department, therefore, utilizedthe best information available. In considering the information availableto us, we noted that MBL Canada has an express warranty of freedom fromdefects in material and workmanship, but incurred no warranty expensesduring the POI. MBL USA also has an express warranty that the Three Starbrand belts conform to or exceed the RMA standards, but did not incur anywarranty expenses during the POI. Furthermore, MBS sells identical merchandisein the Canadian and U.S. markets. Therefore, we have assumed that warrantyexpenses were basically the same for both markets, and we did not makean adjustment for warranty expenses to either foreign market value or UnitedStates price.<T3>Comment 22:</T3> Petitioner argues that in <T3>Consumer Products Division, SCM Corp. </T3>v. <T3>Silver Reed America,</T3> 753 F.2d 1033 9 Fed. Cir. 1985), the FederalCircuit approved the ESP offset on the basis of agency discretion. Thecourt affirmed that primarily and in general, deductions should be limitedto direct selling expenses. The ESP offset, fundamentally, is an exception.Thus, it is clear that when the amount of the offset exceeds the amountdeducted from U.S. price, the general rule identified by the Court (<T3>i.e.,</T3> that adjustments be limited to directly related expenses)is thwarted. Given that exporter's sales price is a unit price, it is clearthat the offset also should be on a per unit basis. MBL's theory of aggregateexpenses would undermine that purpose of the offset and run afoul of thegeneral rule limiting deductions to directly related expenses.Petitioner further argues that the Department has consistently appliedthe ESP offset cap on a sale-by-sale basis and that respondent has failedto provide a sufficient justification for the proposed radical departurefrom the Department's well-established policy. In addition, a cap basedon per unit expenses alleviates the administrative burden of closely scrutinizingalleged indirect selling expenses. Petitioner further argues that the respondenthas misconstrued the Department's regulation and agency practice with respectto the commisison offset. Petitioner claims that the commission offsetis also applied on a per unit basis.Respondent claims that the Department should apply the ESP cap on the aggregateamount of indirect selling expenses in the United States and Canada andnot on a sale-by-sale, product-by-product basis, because the Department'sregulation provides that the offset be made ``for all actual selling expensesin the home market up to the amount of selling expenses incurred in theUnited States market.'' Respondent claims that the Department's determinationsin <T3>Color Television Receivers from Korea,</T3> 49 FR 7628, and <T3>Television Receiving Sets, Monochrome and Color, from Japan,</T3> 46FR 30163 (June 5, 1981) show that on occasion the Department has appliedthe ESP offset cap on an aggregate basis. Respondent argues that the ESPoffset cap should be treated in the same manner as the commission offset.<T3>DOC Position:</T3> We agree with petitioner that it has been the Department'spolicy to calculate the ESP offset on a per unit basis. As we said in <T3>Certain Internal Combustion, Industrial Forklift Trucks from Japan,</T3>53 FR 12552:Capping on an aggregate basis would not reflect the individual circumstancesof each sale, and may lead to adjustments distarted by the comparativesize of each market. Thus, we continue to use our standard policy of cappinghome market indirect selling expenses on a sale-by-sale basis, as describedin the Department's 1985 Adjustment Study.<T3>Comment 23:</T3> Respondent argues that the manner in which the Departmentapplied the ESP cap in the preliminary determination amounts to doubleESP capping.Petitioner argues that, contrary to the respondent's assertion, the Departmenthas not utilized a two-step ESP cap procedure in this proceeding. Instead,consistent with agency practice, the Department capped the third countrymarket indirect selling expenses on a sale-by-sale basis.<T3>DOC Position:</T3> In the preliminary determination, we used our standardprocedure and capped the third country market indirect selling expenseson a sale-by-sale basis. This did not amount to double ESP capping.<T3>Comment 24:</T3> Petitioner asserts that in its scope of investigationat the preliminary determination, the Department listed only four HTS subheadings.Petitioner requests that the Department list eighteen HTS subheadings inits final determination.<T3>DOC Position:</T3> We agree. The petition included nine TSUSA itemnumbers and four HTS subheadings that petitioner believed would correspondto the TSUSA numbers when the HTS system became effective.The HTS went into effect on January 1, 1989. Based on a concordance betweenTSUSA item numbers and HTS subheadings listed in a January 1989 USITC publication,<T3>``The Continuity of Import and Export Trade Statistics After Implementationof the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System,''</T3> petitionerrequested that the Department expand the four HTS subheadings listed inour preliminary to 18 subheadings. We asked for comments from the interestedparties in this investigation concerning industrial belts covered by the18 HTS subheadings.In our preliminary determination as now, we note that the written descriptionof the products covered by the investigation is dispositive. The HTS numbersare provided for convenience and customs purposes as to the scope of theproduct coverage. We do not view providing additional HTS subheadings asbroadening the scope of this investigation.Continuation of Suspension of LiquidationIn accordance with section 733(d)(1) of the Act, we are directing the U.S.Customs Service to continue to suspend liquidation of all entries of industrialbelts from Singapore, as defined in the ``Scope of Investigation'' sectionof this notice, that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption,on or after January 26, 1989, the date of publication of the preliminarydetermination in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. The U.S. Customs Service shall continue to requirea cash deposit or posting of bond equal to the estimated amounts by whichthe foreign market value of the merchandise subject to this investigationexceeds the United States price, as shown below. This suspension of liquidationwill remain in effect until further notice.The weighted-average margins are as follows:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,s10,12</C> <H1>Manufacturer/producer/exporter</H1><H1>Weighted-average margin percentage</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Mitsuboshi Belting (Singapore) Pte.
