This amount represents an increase of $9.7 million or13.9 percent over the PSAF of $69.7 million targeted for 1989.The Monetary Control Act of 1980 requires that fee schedules for the FederalReserve's priced services include an allocation of imputed costs for ``taxesthat would have been paid and the return on capital that would have beenprovided had the services been furnished by a private business firm.''These imputed costs are based on data developed in part from a model comprisedof the nation's 50 largest bank holding companies (``BHCs'').Briefly stated, the methodology first entails determining the value ofFederal Reserve assets that will be used directly in producing priced servicesduring the coming year, including the net effect of assets planned to beacquired or disposed of during the year. Short-term assets are assumedto be financed by short-term liabilities; long-term assets are assumedto be financed by a combination of long-term debt and equity.Imputed capital costs are determined by applying related interest ratesand rate of return on equity derived from the bank holding company modelto the assumed debt and equity values. The rates drawn from the BHC modelare based on consolidated financial data for the 50 largest BHCs (in termsof asset size), in each of the last five years. Because short-term debt,by definition, matures within one year, only data for the most recent yearare used for computing the short-term debt rate.Capital costs, together with imputations for estimated sales taxes, FDICinsurance assessment on clearing balances held with the Federal Reserveto settle transactions, and expenses of the Board of Governors relatedto priced services, comprise the PSAF.Details regarding the derivation of the PSAF are as follows:Asset BaseThe estimated value of Federal Reserve assets to be used in providing pricedservices in 1990 is reflected in Table 1. Table 2 shows that the valueof assets assumed to be financed through debt and equity are projectedto total $487.7 million, an increase of $42.7 million or 9.6 percent from1989. This increase results largely from capital expenditures for bankpremises planned by the Reserve Banks next year and from an increase usageof Reserve Bank premises by priced services relative to non-priced activities.Cost of Capital and TaxesEarlier this year, the Board approved imputing the cost of equity capitalfor the PSAF using an average of rates of return on equity derived froma model of the 50 largest privately-owned bank holding companies in eachof the last 5 years in order to reduce the variability of imputed returnon equity caused by fluctuations in bank holding company earnings. In addition,the BHCs with the highest and lowest returns on equity are no longer excludedfrom the sample. Use of the 5 year/50 BHC model results in a pre-tax rateof return on equity of 15.5 percent, down from the rate of 16.9 percentused for the 1989 PSAF, although it is an increase from the rate of 12.9percent that would have resulted from the 3 year/25 BHC model that hadpreviously been used. The reduction in the rate from the 1989 PSAF is aresult of changes in the sample of BHCs.Table 3 shows the interest, equity, and tax rates proposed for 1990 andcompares them with the rates used for developing the PSAF for 1989.Other Imputed CostsAs shown in Table 3, other required PSAF recoveries for 1990 for salestaxes, FDIC insurance, and Board expenses total $15.9 million, up from$11.4 million approved for 1989. A large portion of the increase, $2.4million, is attributable to another change in the PSAF methodology approvedby the Board earlier this year. The imputed FDIC insurance assessment isnow computed using a measure of deposits including deferred credit itemscomputed on a basis comparable to a commercial bank. In addition, imputedsales taxes are projected to increase by $1.9 million, largely as a resultof an increase in anticipated expenditures by the Reserve Banks in 1990over 1989.Capital AdequacyThe final modification to the PSAF methodology approved by the Board in1989 was to measure the imputed capital adequacy of the Reserve Banks'priced services activities on the basis of the Board-approved risk-basedcapital guideline of 8 percent capital to risk-weighted assets for statemember banks and BHCs. To comply with this guideline, the Board includedin Reserve Bank assets a computation of cash items in the process of collectionon a basis comparable to a commercial bank. On this basis, the amount ofcapital imputed for the proposed 1990 PSAF totals 24 percent of risk-weightedassets. Table 4 shows the computation of the risk-based capital ratio assumedfor the 1990 pro forma priced services balance sheet.<ITAG tagnum="84">1990 Fee Schedules</ITAG>The Monetary Control Act requires that, over the long run, fees for FederalReserve priced services be established on the basis of all direct and indirectcosts incurred in providing the priced services, including the PSAF. TheBoard's pricing principles state that fees will be set so that the revenuesfor major service categories match costs, including the PSAF. The Boardmay set fees for a service line that do not fully recover costs, in theinterest of providing an adequate level of services nationwide. The feesfor each service line, however, must recover all operating costs, floatcosts, and certain imputed costs of providing that service, as well ascontribute to the pre-tax return on equity. Total revenue for all FederalReserve services must, in the aggregate, recover all costs, including thePSAF.Last year the Board approved fees that were set to recover 103.4 percentof the cost of providing priced services in 1989, including the PSAF andthe cost of float. Through the first eight months of 1989, the System recovered101.1 percent of total costs. The Board estimates that total 1989 costs,including the PSAF, will be $716.1 million. Total revenue is estimatedto be $718.0 million, resulting in a 100.3 percent recovery rate. The primaryreason for the estimated 1989 recover rate being lower than originallyplanned is unanticipated check collection service costs attributable tothe effects of the new Regulation CC returned check procedures on ReserveBank operations.In 1990, total priced services costs, including the PSAF, are projectedto be $750.6 million. Total revenue is projected to be $755.9 million,resulting in a 100.7 percent recovery rate. The majority of the proposed1990 fees are the same as those currently in effect. Since 1984, as thetable below shows, the System has made substantial progress in moving closerto its target of 100 percent cost recovery.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,i1,s10,10,10,10</C><T4>All Priced Financial Services</T4><H1> </H1><H1>Total cost (millions)</H1><H1>Total revenue (millions)</H1><H1>Recovery rate (percent)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">1984<D>$519.1</D><D>$559.8</D><D>107.8</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1985<D>571.2</D><D>603.8</D><D>105.7</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1986<D>599.3</D><D>627.7</D><D>104.7</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1987<D>627.3</D><D>649.7</D><D>103.5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1988<D>674.7</D><D>667.7</D><D>99.0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1989 Est<D>716.1</D><D>718.0</D><D>100.3</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1990 Proj<D>750.6</D><D>755.9</D><D>100.7</D></ITAG></ITAG>The Board has approved expenditures for two special research and developmentefforts designed to lead to major benefits for the payments mechanism.These efforts include projects to improve the reliability of electronicpayment services and to explore the application of digital image technologyto the check service. The expenditures on these special research and developmentefforts may fluctuate significantly from year to year and are consideredto contribute to priced services costs only temporarily. The special projectsassociated with the automated clearing house, funds transfer, book-entrysecurities, and check services will cost an estimated $4.1 million in 1989and $1.6 million in 1990. The 1990 fees are based on total costs, includingthe PSAF, but excluding special project costs.Following is a discussion of estimated 1989 and projected 1990 financialperformance and 1990 fees for the individual priced services.Check CollectionComparisons of estimated 1989 and projected 1990 cost recovery performanceare shown in the table below for the commercial check service.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,i1,s10,10,10,10</C><T4>Check Collection</T4><H1> </H1><H1>Total cost</H1><H1>Total revenue (millions)</H1><H1>Recovery rate (percent)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">1989<D>$553.9</D><D>$549.9</D><D>99.3</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1990<D>579.7</D><D>582.4</D><D>100.5</D></ITAG></ITAG>The total costs in the table do not include special projects, which wouldlower the 1989 and 1990 recovery rates to 98.9 percent and 100.3 percent,respectively. Overall, 1990 check collection costs, including PSAF, areprojected to increase 4.6 percent. Total check collection volume is projectedto increase 1.6 percent.Seventy-two percent of the 1990 prices for check services are the sameas those currently in effect. The aggregate 1990 price change for forwardand return check collection services is an increase of 2.5 percent; theprice increase in forward collection fees alone is 0.9 percent. Systemwide,548 of the processed forward collection item fees will remain unchanged,108 of the fees will increase, and 45 of the fees will decrease. Forwardcheck collection processed volume is projected to increase 1.1 percentin 1990, compared to an estimated 1.7 percent increase in 1989.The price increase in return collection fees is 15.2 percent. Of the 600processed return item fees, 331 will remain unchanged and 269 will increase.The increases in return item fees are attributable to higher costs associatedwith staff increases made in return item processing during 1989 and toautomation and software system changes to support new return item operations.Return item volume is projected to remain relatively flat (a 0.5 percentdecrease) in 1990, with the percentage of total returns that are qualified,rather than deposited as raw returns,\1\<NOTE/> increasing slightly from 82 percent in 1989 to 85 percentin 1990.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ A raw returned check is a return that has not been preparedfor automated processing. A qualified returned check (``QRC'') is a returnthat has been prepared for automated processing by placing a strip on thecheck, or placing the check in a carrier envelope, and encoding the stripor envelope with the routing number of the depositary bank, the amountof the check, and a special return identifier.A Systemwide action plan to improve return item quality has been implementedin all districts and has significantly reduced overtime and float expensesthroughout the System. Further developments in the quality of return itemsdeposited with the Federal Reserve are needed in order to realize the reductionsin return item processing costs. The Reserve Banks continue to devote additionalresources to dealing with misdirected returns, returns that do not complywith indorsement standards, returns of poor physical quality, and highlevels of return item adjustments. The Reserve Banks will continue workingwith depositors to improve the overall quality of return item deposits.The Board has approved a decrease of 1.3 percent in fine-sort fees forboth forward collection and return items. Two hundred fifteen of the finesort fees will remain unchanged, none will increase, and 21 fees will decrease.Fine-sort item volume is projected to increase 3.3 percent in 1990, reflectingboth lower prices overall and improved deadlines adopted for 1990. Consolidationof private check clearing operations stemming from bank mergers is alsoexpected to increase demand for fine-sort.With regard to the Interdistrict Transportation System (``ITS''), 54 percentof the 4,512 prices will not change from those currently in effect, 14percent will increase by one-tenth of a cent, 30 per cent will decreaseby one-tenth of a cent, and less than 2 percent will change by more thanone-tenth of a cent. Overall, the weighted average ITS fee will declineapproximately 1 percent. ITS volume is projected to increase approximately1 percent in 1990. ITS fees are incorporated into the Other Fed fees chargedby Reserve Banks. Private collecting institutions consolidating their workon Federal Reserve ITS transportation (consolidated shippers) are chargedthe ITS fee for transportation to the designated Reserve Bank office.Sixty-four new check collection deadlines have been approved for 1990.All deadline changes reflect improvements to depositors and are in conformancewith System guidelines.Automated Clearing House (``ACH'')Comparisons of the estimated 1989 and projected 1990 cost recovery performancefor the commercial ACH service are shown in the table below.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,i1,s10,10,10,10</C><T4>Automated Clearing House</T4><H1>  </H1><H1>Total cost (millions) </H1><H1>Total revenue (millions) </H1><H1>Recovery rate (percent)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">1989 <D>$48.3 </D><D>$49.2 </D><D>101.8</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1990 <D>52.3 </D><D>52.3 </D><D>100.1</D></ITAG></ITAG>The total costs in the table do not include special project costs, whichwould reduce the 1989 and 1990 recovery rates to 100.6 percent and 99.8percent, respectively. The Board estimates that total ACH costs, includingthe PSAF, will increase $4.0 million or 8.3 percent in 1990, while commercialACH volume will increase by 22.4 percent, compared to an estimated 23.6percent increase in 1989. This pattern of changes in cost and volume reflectsthe economies of scale inherent in ACH processing.The Board has reduced the surcharges for processing ACH transactions atnight to reflect continued decreases in float costs and more efficientACH processing. The night surcharge on debit transactions will be reducedfrom 3.5 cents to 2.0 cents, and the surcharge on next-day credit transactionswill be reduced from 1.5 cents to 1.0 cents.The Board has also reduced the interregional transaction fee from 1.7 centsto 1.6 cents in 1990. The fee reflects economies of scale in ACH processingand recent software changes that result in more efficient editing of ACHtransactions.Beginning in April 1990, all districts except for San Francisco will processACH transactions at only one location. The San Francisco District willoperate two processing sites reflecting its contingency processing arrangements.For this reason, and because interdistrict network charges are not a costcomponent in intradistrict transactions, the Board has altered the definitionof interregional transactions. Beginning April 2, 1990, the Reserve Bankswill assess the intraregional fee for all transactions that are originatedto and received by depository institutions within the same Federal Reservedistrict, and apply the interregional fee only to transactions betweeninstitutions located in different Federal Reserve districts. The Board has also adopted higher fees for processing ACH files and addendarecords to reflect data processing and communications costs more accurately.The file fee will increase from $1.00 to $1.25 per file. Intraregionaland interregional addenda fees will increase to 0.4 and 0.5 cents from0.2 and 0.3 cents, respectively. Automated ACH processing is priced nationally. In the past, the ReserveBanks have established fees within specified ranges for nonautomated processing,such as magnetic tape and paper output handling and processing return itemssubmitted in paper form. For 1990, the Board has approved national feesfor nonautomated as well as automated ACH processing. In addition, theBoard approved higher fees for most nonautomated processing componentsof the ACH service to better recover the costs associated with labor-intensiveprocessing. Analysis of the costs of various components of the ACH servicehas indicated that the costs of providing these nonautomated services are,in many cases, significantly higher than the fees currently being assessed.Accordingly, the Board approved increases in nonautomated fees. Funds Transfer and Net SettlementComparisons of the estimated 1989 cost recovery performance and the 1990projected cost recovery performance for the funds transfer and net settlementservice are shown in the table below. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,i1,s10,10,10,10</C><T4>Funds Transfer and Net Settlement</T4><H1> </H1><H1>Total cost</H1><H1>Total revenue (million)</H1><H1>Recovery rate (percent)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">1989<D>$73.2</D><D>$76.8</D><D>105.0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1990<D>77.2</D><D>78.7</D><D>102.0</D></ITAG></ITAG>The total costs in the table do not include special project costs, whichwould reduce the 1989 and 1990 recovery rates to 103.4 percent and 101.6percent, respectively. In 1990, the Board estimates that funds transfercosts, including the PSAF, will increase by $4.0 million or about 5.4 percentover 1989. The volume of basic funds transfers originated is expected toincrease by 5.1 percent in 1990, compared to an estimated increase of 6.0percent in 1989. For 1990, the Board will maintain the basic funds transfer fee at its currentlevel of $0.50. In addition, current net settlement and off-line wire transferfees will remain in effect in 1990. Book-Entry SecuritiesComparisons of the estimated 1989 cost recovery performance and the 1990projected cost recovery performance are shown in the table below for thebook-entry securities service.\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ These financial data relate only to book-entry transfersof government agency securities, which are priced by the Federal Reserve.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,i1,s10,10,10,10</C><T4>Book-Entry Securities</T4><H1> </H1><H1>Total cost (millions)</H1><H1>Total revenue (millions)</H1><H1>Recovery rate (percent)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">1989<D>$9.5</D><D>$10.2</D><D>107.3</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1990<D>10.7</D><D>11.1</D><D>103.7</D></ITAG></ITAG>The total costs in the table do not include special project costs, whichwould reduce the 1989 and 1990 recovery rates to 103.7 percent and 102.9percent, respectively. Book-entry securities volume is projected to increase8.3 percent in 1990, while costs are projected to increase approximately12.1 percent. Approximately 4.7 percent of this cost increase is attributableto volume-weighted reallocations of expenses due to a fall-off in transfersof Treasury securities, which is itself explained by the implementationof netting schemes for Treasury securities. The only change in existing prices for 1990 is the elimination of a feecurrently charged for off-line account switch deposits. An account switchis the withdrawal of a security from one book-entry sub-account for depositto another book-entry sub-account of the same depository institution. FourReserve Banks currently assess a fee to off-line institutions for eachside of the transaction even though the withdrawal and deposit are performednearly simultaneously as part of a single process.The Federal Reserve Banks, as fiscal agents of the United States, alsoprocess book-entry transfers of Treasury securities for depository institutions.These transactions, which are operationally identical to those for Federalagency issues, are subject to a fee determined by the Treasury. A fundssettlement fee of $0.60 is charged for each book-entry transfer of Treasurysecurities to reflect settlement of the transfers by the Reserve Banks.This service, which is a necessary part of the Treasury securities transfer,is treated as a non-priced service. The Treasury intends to keep its 1990prices stable, recognizing that there will be a need for further evaluationof fees as the Government Securities Clearing Corportation (``GSCC'') nettingprogram becomes fully implemented. GSCC's netting program has and willlikely further reduce the number of Treasury book-entry transfers processedthrough the Federal Reserve book-entry system. In 1990, the Treasury andthe Federal Reserve will also evaluate the cost impact of other factorsincluding the development of the future of a book-entry system. Since theimpact of these factors is uncertain, the Board has not modified book-entryfees in 1990.Electronic ConnectionsFees are charged for electronic connections to the Federal Reserve Banks.The 1990 electronic connection fees are largely the same as those currentlyin effect. The multi-drop connection fee at $300 per month, and the dedicatedleased line connection fee at $600 per month. In addition, the $100 bulkdata software fee will be eliminated.The Federal Reserve plans to introduce new intelligent terminal softwarethat will allow depository institutions that receive a low volume of ACHpayments to do so efficiently on a small personal computer. This alternativewill enable depository institutions to receive payment information fromReserves Banks electronically (but not originate payment instructions)and print the information for subsequent processing. This innovation willbe instrumental in achieving the Federal Reserve's objective of an all-electronicACH. The dial-up connection fee for this low-volume delivery mechanismwill be $30 month.<ITAG tagnum="84">Definitive Safekeeping and Noncash Collection</ITAG>Comparisons of the estimated 1989 and 1990 projected cost recovery performancefor the definitive safekeeping and noncash collection service are shownin the table below.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,i1,s10,10,10,10</C><T4>Definitive Safekeeping and Noncash Collection</T4><H1> </H1><H1>Total cost (millions)</H1><H1>Total revenue (millions)</H1><H1>Recovery rate (percent)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">1989 <D>$17.2 </D><D>$17.5 </D><D>102.0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1990 <D>16.9 </D><D>17.0 </D><D>100.4</D></ITAG></ITAG>Definitive safekeeping and noncash collection costs are expected to decreaseby 1.4 percent in 1990 as Reserve Banks continue to adjust costs in reactionto anticipated volume declines, as no new bearer securities have been issuedsince 1983. Definitive safekeeping volumes in 1990 are expected to decreaseabout 10.0 percent and noncash collection volume is expected to decrease6.2 percent.The Board has increased definitive safekeeping prices in six districtsto offset volume declines. Increases range from $1.00 to $8.25 for depositand withdrawal fees, from $0.15 to $1.50 for receipts/issues maintained,from $1.00 to $8.25 for purchases and sales and reregistrations, and, byone district, to $0.005 per month per $1,000 par value maintained.
