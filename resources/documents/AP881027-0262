Gold priceswere higher.   The dollar came under renewed pressure at midday, partly pusheddown by a report of a narrower-than-expected British trade deficitin September and continued selling pressure related to Wednesday'sreport of a modest rise in the U.S. gross national product.   ``People are uncertain following the surprisingly good figuresfrom Britain,'' said a senior dealer at a bank in Frankfurt, WestGermany. ``They were buying (British) pounds and selling dollars.''   Britain's merchandise deficit narrowed to 1.06 billion pounds($1.87 billion) in September, partly helped by erratic items such asexports of aircraft repairs and precious stones, the government saidThursday.   The U.S. government said the third-quarter gross national productrose at an annual rate of 2.2 percent, the smallest rise in almosttwo years.   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.90 Japanese yen to a closing 125.90yen. Later, in London, it slipped back further to 125.75 yen.   In London, the British pound rose to $1.7695 from $1.7600 lateWednesday.   Dealers said the dollar recovered some ground in late Europeantrading on buying by Japanese traders. Market fears of central bankintervention had prevented the dollar from falling further.
