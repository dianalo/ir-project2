Energy Secretary James D. Watkins has told Congress he'll havean energy plan ready by next April, although there are indicationsthis target may be missed.   Watkins and his chief deputy, Henson Moore, have appeared beforeseveral key industry groups recently to sketch in some of the keycontours of what Watkins says will be a ``common sense approach''to putting America on a more solid energy foundation.   Some of the main areas of emphasis will be familiar: greaterleeway for oil companies to explore on federal lands, tax breaksfor oil drillers, decontrol of natural gas prices, expansion ofnuclear power and pursuit of basic research.   More novel will be the Energy Department's pursuit of whatWatkins calls ``technology transfer'' _ ensuring that energyresearch advances made in the department's national scientificlaboratories are made available to industry and universities. Thelabs' main focus is on top-secret nuclear weapons programs, butWatkins said they have done extensive work in unclassified energyareas.   Watkins also has said his energy strategy will be morecomprehensive than anything produced during the Reaganadministration. It will take into account, for example, the linksbetween energy and the environment, including acid rain and theglobal atmospheric warming trend caused mainly by burning of fossilfuels, he said.   Moore has billed the evolving strategy as a clear departure frompast policies.   ``We're going to fashion the first real national energy policythis country has ever had,'' the former Louisiana congressman saidat his swearing-in ceremony April 20.   The government has produced many energy policies in the past,but Moore's remark seemed to reflect the fact that the Reaganadministration's policy suffered from criticism byenvironmentalists and a lack of interest by the general public.   ``You could ask 100 people if the country had an energy policyand 99 would say `no,''' Donald Hodel, the energy secretary from1982-85, said in a telephone interview. He said there was a policybut that it was not commonly recognized.   Watkins, an engineer by training and a career naval officer,wants to broaden the scope of the government's energy involvement.Beyond the traditional issues of energy production, price andsupply, Watkins sees room for his department to help stimulateyoung people's interest in science, math and engineering _ areas ofeducation that he says are vital to the nation's energy future.   This is where the nuclear issue fits in. Watkins is a devotedsupporter of commercial nuclear power, and he is troubled at thedepth of public distrust of this energy source, which accounts fornearly one-fifth of all electricity generation.   No orders for new nuclear plants have been placed in 11 yearsand none are expected for the rest of the century. Scores of plantshave been cancelled in the past decade, and nuclear's share ofenergy production is projected to fall in the 1990s. The Reaganadministration supported nuclear power but failed to revive it.   This has produced two results that Watkins says threaten thenation's long-term energy security: a shrinking energy base and adeterioration of nuclear expertise.   This is part of Watkins' motivation for launching a publicitycampaign against New York Gov. Mario Cuomo's plan to tear down theShoreham nuclear plant on Long Island, which earlier this month wascleared for startup by federal regulators.   ``Because Shoreham is the right energy source at the right timefor the right place, its operation should stand as a symbol of thepromise and potential of nuclear power in America,'' Watkins saidafter the plant got its license.   Cuomo wants to tear it down because of doubts about whether LongIslanders could safety evacuate in the event of an accident.Watkins has vowed to fight the dismantlement.   Watkins is taking an analogous approach to the problem of aslumping oil industry, whose prospects for long-term revival havebeen damaged by the Exxon Valdez oil spill. As a result of thataccident _ the biggest spill in U.S. history _ industry hopes forexpanding exploration on the North Slope have diminished.   Watkins has expressed alarm at the decline in U.S. oilproduction since 1986, which has coincided with a rise in oil useand a resulting jump in oil imports.   Besides making the country more reliable on oil from the MiddleEast, the domestic oil slump has weakened young people's interestin learning the business, he said. Watkins recently cited figuresshowing that between 1982 and 1987 the number of freshmen enrolledin petroleum engineering schools plunged from 3,300 to 271.   ``Let us at least be forward thinking enough to prepareAmerica's young people to be part of the energy breakthroughs ofthe next century,'' Watkins said.   The technological advances that Watkins thinks are mostimportant include:   _A ``clean coal'' method of burning the nation's most abundantenergy source in ways that provide more power with less pollution.The department plans to spend $5 billion through 1992 ondemonstration projects by private companies.   _New designs for nuclear reactors to reduce their vulnerabilityto meltdowns or other serious accidents that have eroded publicconfidence in the industry. Numerous such ``passively safe''designs are under development.   _A superconducting super collider. Watkins says he will push forfederal financing of the $5.9 billion physics installation in Texasat which scientists plan to explore the fundamental components ofmatter and energy.</TEXT></DOC>
