ROSENBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The people who have made the leveraged buyout oneof the most popular avenues for financing blockbuster corporateacquisitions are being asked to explain to Congress why theircontroversial methods should not be curtailed.   Leveraged buyouts _ acquisitions made mainly with borrowed moneythat is repaid by the target company _ have made possible many ofthis country's biggest corporate purchases, such as the recentrecord-shattering $24.53 billion buyout of RJR Nabisco Inc. byKohlberg Kravis Roberts Inc.   But critics of LBOs contend the deals can cost jobs as new ownersseek to cut costs at the suddenly debt-burdened companies. They alsosay taxpayers are helping finance LBOs through tax breaks given tobuyers and that the higher debt burdens raise the risk that theacquired companies will fail.   The criticism has increased over the past year, partly because ofpublicity surrounding the RJR Nabisco deal and other huge buyouts.   Nine congressional committees plan hearings about LBOs, with theSenate Finance Committee scheduled to hold the first session onTuesday.   Some major LBO sponsors say the deals have not hurt the targetcompanies or the taxpayer.   ``If you get someone who is trying to do a very good job ofanalyzing what's going on, I think the analysis would lead you toconclude (LBOs are) a net positive,'' said Joseph L. Rice, a partnerin the investment firm and LBO specialist Clayton andamp; Dubilier Inc.   In a leveraged buyout, investors borrow heavily to buy out acompany and pay off the debt with the target company's cash flow orthe sale of its assets, including its divisions and subsidiaries. Toimprove a company's cash flow acquirers may cut its costs, and thatcan mean layoffs.   Kohlberg Kravis _ the undisputed leader in the field _ contendsthat a study it undertook to counter its critics indicates the 15firms it acquired through leveraged buyouts had a total employmentincrease of 37,000.   Rice said although an LBO business might be pared down, ``by andlarge employment is either up or flat'' at companies Clayton andamp;Dubilier has acquired.   He also said leveraged buyouts provided opportunities for peoplewho otherwise could not afford to buy a company, and called theprocess ``the last great bastion for the entrepreneur in the UnitedStates today.''   But critics say the heavy borrowing needed to create thoseopportunities put a company and its lenders in jeopardy. Buyoutsoften financed are with junk bonds, higher-risk loans that pay ahigher rate of interest.   Critics point to Revco D.S. Inc., the large Ohio-based drugstorechain that went private in a $1.5 billion LBO in 1986 and last yearfiled for federal bankruptcy protection from its creditors after itfailed to make a $46 million payment to junk bond holders.   Cynthia Latta, an economist for Data Resources Inc. in Lexington,Mass., said the failure of LBO companies was a risk that could berealized if the economy slides into a recession and the companies nolonger could generate the revenue to make their payments.   But Rice said the higher debt levels of LBO companies generallyhave benefited stockholders and the economy.   ``If you take a look at buyouts over an extended period of time,say for the last 20 years, you would conclude the businesses thathave been bought have used a very significant amount of debt intheir capital structure,'' he said. ``Many worldwide competitorshave used debt for years and used it effectively.''   Opponents also want to rein in buyouts by amending the federalincome tax laws, which currently give an acquirer a deduction forall interest payments.   President Bush said recently a review of the tax laws might be inorder to curb any abuses, but he would not advocate governmentaction to put the brakes on takeovers.   The Kohlberg Kravis study contends the firm's buyouts have notshortchanged the Treasury, and actually have added $2 billion tofederal coffers, while Rice called buyouts ``a net tax-producer.''   Ms. Latta said the government did reap short-term benefits from aleveraged buyout, because stockholders tendering their shares to theacquirer paid capital gains taxes. But the government may be losingout through long-term tax benefits to the acquirer, she said.   ``If there were no long-term tax gains for the company, theyprobably would not be doing it,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
