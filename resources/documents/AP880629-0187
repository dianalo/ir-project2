The Rev. Jerry Falwell contended Bush's advisers are pressinghim to refrain from mentioning controversial issues such asreproductive rights and homosexuality.   At the other end of the political spectrum, representatives fromthe National Organization for Women and the Fund for a FeministMajority said the Democrats should not assume the ``gender gap''frees them of responsibility in promoting women's causes and femalecandidates.   Falwell called homosexuality a ``perverted lifestyle,'' and whenasked if he would urge Bush to make the same statement, he said,``I would recommend that everyone tell the truth, and that's whatit is; it's a perverted lifestyle.''   The TV evangelist joined other conservatives in announcing``Family Forum 88'' to be held before both the Democratic andRepublican national conventions this summer.   Meanwhile, feminists and People for the American Way announcedopposing convention plans to highlight liberal views.   Falwell, himself a strong Bush supporter, said, ``It isimportant for George Bush to pick up the mantle'' of support forconservative social issues that endeared President Reagan to theright. But he said a vanguard of experts and advisers is ``tryingto keep George Bush from doing what he needs to do.''   He said the Bush campaign cannot rest assured that the religiousright ``will have nowhere else to go'' other than the Republicanticket.   ``We can go fishing,'' he told a news conference. ``If they'renot enthusiastic, they don't vote,'' he said of religiousconservatives.   Falwell said he is confident Bush is committed to the agenda ofconservative family issues that helped elect Reagan but added,``Heneeds to be saying that openly and often.''   Falwell said that in talking to evangelical leaders he hassensed ``a deep and unanimous concern that the Republican Partythis time is offering little more than the Democratic Party.''   Eleanor Smeal of the Fund for a Feminist Majority and NOWpresident Molly Yard saved most of their fire for the Republicans,whose platform hearings Smeal will address this week.   Smeal said the gender gap, in which polls show women voting moreDemocratic in the Reagan years and providing the margin of victoryin some congressional races, is becoming ``a gender gulf.''   Still, despite the GOP's comparative ``backwardness'' in issuessuch as comparable worth, Equal Rights Amendment, reproductivechoice, employment equity and party decision-making, said Yard,``It's perfectly possible for the Democrats ... to throw away theiradvantage. We will do our bst to make both parties realize that thegender gap is there to be used.''   Meanwhile, People for the American Way, a liberal lobby groupfounded by TV producer Norman Lear, plans to be on hand at both theRepublican and Democratic conventions this summer to counter theefforts of the right to influence the parties, said the group'spresident, Arthur Kropp.   He said Falwell and the other Family Forum sponsors, includingBeverly LaHaye of Concerned Women for America and Paul Weyrich ofthe Free Congress Foundation, were using a family-issues screen topromote their real positions against civil rights, women's rights,and gay rights and for such foreign policy items as the StrategicDefense Initiative.   Weyrich said both political parties were reluctant to publiclysupport the conservative social agenda, saying, ``The party leadershate controversial issues.''</TEXT></DOC>
