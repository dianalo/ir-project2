But in the case of stock funds, the trick isn't to findthe bad guys, but to avoid them.   The fact is, most stock funds perform pretty well overlong periods of time. Among funds that spread their assetsaround stocks from a variety of different industries, 74%would have at least tripled your money over the 10 yearsthrough June 1991, according to Lipper Analytical Services.Providing you avoided the other 26%, you would have plenty tocrow about.   So how do you go about finding a decent stock fund -- andavoiding the turkeys?   Fund analysts say the crucial factors in picking a stockfund are quite different from those that should be used whenselecting a bond or money-market fund. With money funds andmost bond funds, analysts say, the most important criteriaare each fund's annual expenses; that issue will be discussedin tomorrow's article. But when it comes to hunting down awell-managed stock fund, analysts put a lot of emphasis onpast performance, especially a fund's results over longertime periods such as five and 10 years.   If you want to find out about past performance, a goodplace to start is with one of the regular surveys of mutualfund performance appearing in publications such as Barron'sWeekly, Forbes, Kiplinger's Personal Finance and Money.Another place to look is in The Wall Street Journal, whichlists the best and worst performing funds once a quarter andalso ranks the winners within fund categories through a dailyMutual Fund Scorecard on the mutual fund quotations page.   But these surveys will provide you only with the names ofsuspects -- top funds in which you might want to invest.Before you plunk down your money, you would be well advisedto dig a little deeper.   For starters, be aware of what these performance numbersreally represent. Most fund surveys publish &quot;total return&quot;numbers, attempting to show how an investor is really doingby combining together two very different things. Total returnis the sum of whatever dividends the fund has paid, pluswhatever gain or loss has occurred in the value of the fund'sshare price.   Total return performance numbers assume the investor hasbeen immediately reinvesting any capital-gains and incomedistributions that a fund has paid out. If you decide to takeyour dividends in cash, your fund investment won't grow atthe same pace as that of somebody who chooses to reinvesttheir dividends in additional fund shares.   In addition, published fund results typically don't takeinto account the effect of the sales commission or &quot;load&quot;that some funds charge when you buy or sell fund shares,though they do reflect the impact of annual fund expensessuch as the investment advisory fee paid to the fund'smanager. As a result, anybody who owns a load fund won't doas well as the published performance numbers suggest.   A fund's past performance is merely that; it just tellsyou what happened in the past. To make sure that there's agood chance that the fund will continue to do well, fundanalysts suggest running three basic checks.   First of all, take a closer look at a fund's long-termrecord, advises Don Phillips, editor of Mutual Fund Values, aChicago newsletter. &quot;One of my favorite tests is to get theperformance broken down year by year,&quot; he says. &quot;It gives mean idea of what's the best that I can expect from a fund, andwhat's the worst.&quot;   Sometimes, these annual returns are published in a fund'sprospectus, which is the sales document that fund groups sendto all new investors. But if it's not there, one of the fundgroup's telephone service representatives should be able toprovide you with the data. Many fund groups have toll-freetelephone numbers that can be obtained by calling toll-freedirectory inquiries at 800-555-1212.   By looking at annual returns, you can see whether thefund's record was put together through a series of steadygains, or by combining alternating periods of boom and bust.Erratic performance often afflicts both &quot;sector&quot; funds, whichconcentrate their assets in a single industry, and some ofthe &quot; aggressive growth&quot; funds.   Why does such volatile performance matter? It may indicatethat the fund's performance was a fluke, the result of abrief spurt of heady performance that is unlikely to berepeated. &quot;It could be just one year that influenced the{long-term} record, and that could be because of just one ortwo takeover stocks,&quot; warns Kathleen Crowley, a vicepresident with Chicago's Stratford Advisory Group.   Moreover, many investors can't stand such gut-wrenchingprice swings. A sharp price plunge may cause them to panicand dump their fund shares, only to miss the rebound thatfollows. And even if an investor doesn't mind such zigzags,he or she may have to cash out at short notice -- and thatcould happen just after the fund's share price has tumbled20% or more.   As a second test, fund analysts suggest that investors geta feel for why a fund has done well. Stock funds tend toscore big gains partly because of good stock picking, butalso because their particular investment style is in favor.This year, for instance, mutual funds that hold stocks insmaller companies have notched up dazzling gains. Last yearand in 1989, market-beating gains went to funds that boughtlarge-company stocks with rapid earnings growth. And in 1988,it was boom time for &quot;value&quot; investors, who buy stocks thatare cheap relative to current earnings or assets.   Because investment styles go in and out of favor, it'soften a mistake to simply buy the best performing funds forthe past two or three years. There's a good chance that youwill end up with a fistful of funds that have recently beenin vogue and that all do essentially the same thing. That'sfine and good-until that particular investment style fallsout of bed, and with it your mutual fund portfolio.   Stratford Advisory Group's Ms. Crowley advises thatinvestors &quot;should first pick the fund categories -- largecompany, small company, value, growth -- and then pick thebest funds in those categories.&quot; She notes that this may meanbuying, say, a small-stock fund that has a great recordcompared with other small-stock funds, but only a so-sorecord compared with funds that use an investment style thathas lately been in favor.   Finally, fund analysts warn that you should check to seewhether the stock picker responsible for a fund's stellartrack record is still at the fund's helm. This is aparticular problem for funds that are run by so-called starmanagers, who are responsible for most of the fund's buy andsell decisions. In recent years, a number of top fundmanagers have retired or switched jobs, forcing shareholdersto decide whether they too should bail out.   For those who don't want to worry about such things, thereare other types of funds where the departure of a fundmanager wouldn't necessarily mean it's time to dump your fundholdings. For instance, some funds are run by committee, someby computerized stock selection systems and some by a systemof multiple managers. When a fund is run by multiplemanagers, its assets are divided among as many as four &quot;star&quot;managers who run their portions of the fund as individualportfolios.   There are also index funds, which don't employ any activestock pickers, but instead simply buy and hold the stocksthat make up the particular stock market index whoseperformance they are trying to track. To find out exactly howa fund is run, try calling the fund group involved and askingone of the telephone service representatives.</TEXT></DOC>
