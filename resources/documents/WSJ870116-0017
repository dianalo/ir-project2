The Carter administration began the ban in 1978 to protest the trial of Anatoly Shcharansky and other Soviet dissidents. Mr. Shcharansky has since been allowed to emigrate to Israel.    Mr. Baldrige said the U.S. still is dissatisfied with the Soviets' human rights record. In a statement, he denounced the Soviet Union for allowing only 940 Soviet Jews and other minority members to leave the country last year, compared with the 51,000 allowed to leave in 1979.    Sens. Lloyd Bentsen, a Democrat, and Phil Gramm, a Republican, both of Texas, who had pushed for ending the ban, said in a joint statement that yesterday's action will provide a major boost for the depressed oil-equipment industry, which is based mostly in the Southwest and Gulf states.    The U.S. action permits sales of all but the most sensitive oil and natural gas production equipment. Such products as seismic exploration rigs that could have military use still are subject to a licensing process.    Before the ban, the U.S. had a commanding 26% share of the Soviet market for such equipment. The Commerce Department estimates that U.S. producers lost $2 billion in potential sales between 1978 and 1985. A spokesman for Dallas-based Dresser Industries Inc. said that with the ban lifted, &quot;We have to live down the impression the Russians have of us of being unreliable suppliers.&quot;    To show that the U.S. isn't relenting on other export controls based on foreign-policy reasons, the Commerce Department extended until Jan. 20, 1988, various sanctions against Cuba, North Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia and Libya.    As previously reported, the Reagan administration is beginning a new effort to encourage non-aligned nations to join in controlling the shipment of strategic goods to the Soviet bloc. On Wednesday, the National Academy of Sciences released a report that urged the U.S. to abandon its efforts at unilateral controls because they serve only to hurt U.S. producers without adequately stemming the flow of sensitive goods to the Soviet bloc. </TEXT></DOC>
