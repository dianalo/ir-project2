The report, to be issued today by a three-member panel offederal appeals court judges, was compiled by independent counselJames McKay after he concluded in a 14-month criminal investigationthat there is insufficient evidence to seek an indictment of Meese.   McKay submitted his report July 5 under seal to the appealscourt panel which appointed him. Hours later, Meese declared he hadbeen vindicated and announced he would resign.   Despite his impending departure from the Justice Department,Meese's ties to the proposed pipeline and other matters may undergoan ethics review by the department's Office of ProfessionalResponsibility.   In addition to Wedtech and the pipeline, McKay's report delvesinto Meese's decision on behalf of regional Bell telephonecompanies at a time when he held $14,000 in phone stock.</TEXT><DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.

In public appearances, he portrays himself as tender-heartedas well as tough-minded.   In addition, the right-wing army commander tries to present hisgovernment as more democratic and participative. Political analystssee it as a bid to win the electoral backing of many undecidedChileans.   ``I can't govern alone. I need you to help me,'' he told a groupof youths at a breakfast meeting in the southern city of Concepcionduring a question-and-answer session peppered with avuncularobservations and jokes.   The government plans, by early October, a yes-or-no ballot on apresidential candidate to be picked by the heads of the army, airforce, navy and national police. No specific date has been set andno candidate yet named. But Pinochet, who as army chief willparticipate in the selection, is seen as the probable nominee.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Asian-Americans are better paid and bettereducated than American whites, but a report by government civilrights experts is reluctant to declare an ``Asian success story''and insists that discrimination still exists.   Presentation of the 289-page study to the U.S. Commission onCivil Rights, which had ordered it, prompted concern over itsimpact. One commissioner, Mary Frances Berry of the University ofPennsylvania, said it might lead to more discrimination when thepublic realizes how much more Asians are earning.   Six of the seven commissioners voted Friday to hold off onadopting the document as an official government report until moreoutside experts can review and interpret it.   The study, billed as the first comprehensive look at the incomesof nearly 4 million Asian-American residents, shows thatnative-born American families with Chinese ancestry earn 50 percentmore than families in which both husband and wife are white, andKorean and Japanese families earn 46 percent and 44 percent more,respectively.   But some Asian-American ethnic groups are not faring so well.</TEXT></DOC>
