McCLAIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   U.S. savings bonds will earn interest at arate of 6.98 percent over the next six months, down from the 7.81percent rate prevailing over the last six months, the TreasuryDepartment said.   However, the department had to suspend new sales indefinitelyTuesday because of congressional failure to enact legislationraising the federal debt limit.   ``Without new legislation to increase the debt limit, thegovernment lacks authority to issue any new debt obligations,'' theTreasury said in a statement Wednesday.   The government's borrowing authority dropped at midnight Tuesdayfrom $2.87 trillion to $2.80 trillion.   The House has voted to raise the debt ceiling to $3.1 trillionfor the current fiscal year, but Senate legislation has beenblocked by a squabble over whether to cut the capital gains tax.   When savings bonds go back on sale, those issued during theremainder of November will earn interest from the first of themonth, the department said. Payroll savings plans will continue tooperate normally, except that bonds that would have been issuedduring the current suspension will be issued when the suspension islifted.   The new savings bond rate ``reflects market activity during thepast six months and keeps savings bonds in the mainstream offinancial products for the coming semiannual rate period,'' saidJerrold B. Speers, executive director of the Savings Bond Division.   Savings bonds' interest rates are changed each May 1 and Nov. 1to reflect open market rates. They are based on 85 percent of theyield on five-year Treasury securities, which have averaged 8.21percent over the last six months.   Savings bond yields at redemption are the average of semiannualmarket-based rates during the time held, compounded semiannually,or a minimum rate, whichever is greater. The current minimum rateis 6 percent.   Since market rates for bonds were introduced, the rates haveranged from a high of 10.94 percent for the six months beginning inNovember 1984 to a low of 5.84 percent for the six months beginningin May 1987.   In addition to savings bonds, the department suspended the saleof special securities for state and local governments, thetemporary investment vehicles for money those governments raise inthe bond market.   If the securities are not available, state and local governmentscould be forced to cancel planned bond sales, leading to disruptionof the municipal bond market.</TEXT></DOC>
