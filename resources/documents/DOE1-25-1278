<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-25-1278 </DOCNO><TEXT>The case is presented of a 65-year-old woman who developed a painful swellingof the plantar aspect of the right foot over a 3-year period. Conventionalroentgenograms of the foot showed a large, soft tissue mass on the plantaraspect, with some suggestion of erosion of the adjacent metatarsals.CT studies, however, failed to confirm the presence of any bony abnormalities.At the time of the initial presentation, a biopsy was performed and approximately3 months later the patient was treated definitely with wide excisionof the mass. Histological sections showed the presence of a clear-cellsarcoma - an uncommon lesion mainly confined to the lower extremitiesand originating either in tendons or aponeurosis. The differential diagnosis,radiologically and clinically was described, and similarly, the differentialdiagnosis pathologically was also considered. The clinical, pathologicaland radiological aspects of clear-cell sarcoma of tendon sheath or aponeurosiswere discussed in depth and the treatment and prognosis were considered.The authors stress that the importance of the case from a diagnosticimaging perspective lies in the successful use of CT in defining sucha soft tissue neoplasm. The ability of CT to determine the extent ofinvolvement of soft tissue and bone by such a lesion is important. Cross-sectionaltechniques, including magnetic resonance as well as CT, must be the procedureof choice in the definitive diagnosis and treatment of such lesions.</TEXT></DOC>
