The closings are part of a plan Unisys disclosed in October to eliminate about 8%, or 9,600, of its employees and consolidate operations to divest itself of $1.5 billion in assets by 1988. The computer maker will use proceeds from the divestitures to help pay $3.4 billion in debt that was taken on when Burroughs Corp. acquired Sperry Corp. in September.    The Bristol facility, which employs 1,570 workers and produces computer systems and printed circuit boards, is scheduled to close in July, Unisys said. The Eau Claire plant, slated to close in March, makes printed circuit boards for commercial computers and employs 260 people. </TEXT></DOC>
