The electricalresistivity increased and the diamagnetic susceptibility decreased afterthe irradiation, in accordance with a slight shift of T/sub c/ to a lowertemperature. Whereas, Y/sub 0.61/Ba/sub 0.39/CuO/sub y/ irradiated (1x 10/sup 18/ e/cm/sup 2/) at room temperature did not show any superconductivecharacteristics. X-ray examinations at LNT (below T/sub c/) and RT (aboveT/sub c/) were also carried out for both irradiated specimens.</TEXT></DOC>
