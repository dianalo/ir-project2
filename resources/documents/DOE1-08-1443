Based on experimental spectra of iron and cobalt measuredwith an energy dispersive spectrometer a set of spectra with variablepeak position differences and relative intensities has been examined.The spectra have been processed with SAMPO and NOMUL programmes, thelatter routinelly used in the laboratory. Finally the relative errorsfor minor peak areas in multiplets were calculated and compared witherrors resulting from theoretical approach. Practical features of thework have been underlined.</TEXT></DOC>
