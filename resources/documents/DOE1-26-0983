Cell performancewas measured as a function of fluence, and it was found that the cellwith the highest concentration of lithium had the higher radiation resistance.Deep level defects were studied using deep level transient spectroscopywhich yielded two defects that were lithium related. Relating the defectenergy levels obtained from this study under 10 MeV protons, with anearlier work using 1 MeV electron irradiations shows no correlation ofthe defect energy levels. There is one marked comparison though. Theabsence of the boron interstitial-oxygen interstitial defect. This consistencystrengthens the belief that lithium interacts with oxygen to preventthe formation of the boron interstitial-oxygen interstitial defect. Thepresent results indicate that, in general, addition of lithium in smallamounts to the p-base of a boron doped silicon solar cell such that thebase remains p-type, tends to increase the radiation resistance of thecell.</TEXT></DOC>
