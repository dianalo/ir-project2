Using ADA asan example, the production of readable, efficient and maintainable codeis shown to be directly supported by the language, integrating conceptssuch as top-down design, object-oriented programming and data encapsulationas a natural part of the language rather than as foreign ideas imposedon the language. Particular attention is paid to nontraditional aspectsof a language and how these can help by providing an integrated supportenvironment for all phases of the lifetime of the software. 2 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
