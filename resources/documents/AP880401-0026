Thousands of people lined up for meals provided by charity,casualties of the 5-week-old campaign to try to force the ouster ofPanama's de facto leader, Defense Forces chief Gen. Manuel AntonioNoriega.   The office of acting President Manuel Solis Palma issued acommunique Thursday alleging the United States was looking for anincident that could justify military intervention.   It cited a letter from Solis to Javier Perez de Cuellar, theU.N. secretary-general, that said recent U.S. military movements inPanama and its territorial waters constituted a security threat.   ``The Defense Forces of Panama have orders to refrain from usinglethal or destructive weapons at any time against the armed forcesof the United States or against U.S. civilians or against propertyor installations of citizens or the government of the UnitedStates,'' the communique says.   Solis was apparently referring to the passage of the U.S.helicopter carrier Okinawa through the Panama Canal this week andmilitary exercises being conducted by troops stationed at the U.S.Southern Command in Panama.   ``Aware of the overwhelming power threatening it, the Republicof Panama ... will not provide the foundation for fabrication of acharge of aggression that could pretend to justify the launching ofacts of war,'' Solis said. ``Under no circumstances will Panamaallow itself to be provoked nor will it lend itself to thefabrication of an incident.''   It mentions the U.S. invasion of Grenada in 1983, which theReagan administration said was necessary to protect U.S. studentsthere.   On Monday night, police and soldiers arrested and beat severalforeign journalists, including Americans, during a raid on a PanamaCity hotel. The next day, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwatercondemned the incident.   ``It has always been a principle that we will protect Americancitizens as best we can. And while we have said that we don't planto go in (to Panama) militarily, it is also important to note thatthere are limits,'' he said.   The government shut down on Thursday for the Easter weekendwithout paying most of its 130,000 public employees for the secondtime in a month.   It failed to meet the $33 million payroll despite the collectionthis week of $19 million in quarterly tax revenues. About $5.5million was said to be taxes and fees from U.S. companies doingbusiness in Panama.   In Washington, the Senate voted 92-1 for a resolution urgingPresident Reagan to cut off the flow of money from U.S.corporations to the regime of Noriega, who is under U.S. indictmenton charges of trafficking in Colombian cocaine.   Most Panamanians are short of cash and food as a result of an11-day-old general strike and the cash crisis, which was caused inpart by a U.S. freeze on millions of dollars of Panamanian assetsin American banks.   The sanctions were imposed after the Noriega-orchestrated ousterFeb. 26 of President Eric Arturo Delvalle in retaliation forDelvalle's attempt to fire Noriega.   Banks have been closed since March 3.   With most businesses and industries observing the generalstrike, the largest congregations of people were found in the foodlines of welfare agencies.   The Rev. Laurino Duran, head of a Roman Catholic Church reliefsociety, said his organization was feeding 9,000 families a day.   ``The number is growing daily,'' the priest said, adding thatthe effort is costing $600,000 a month, which the church receivesin donated cash and food.   Leaders of the National Civic Crusade were meeting to plan newstrategies in their frustrated effort to oust Noriega.   ``We'll be talking over the weekend, discussing where we go fromhere,'' said Roberto Aleman, an attorney and director of theCrusade, a coalition of about 200 professional, business, labor,political and other groups.</TEXT></DOC>
