Pakistani and U.S. investigators searching the wreckage ineastern Pakistan of the president's C-130 transport plane have yetto report their findings on the crash Aug. 17 that killed thefive-star army general, U.S. Ambassador Arnold Raphel and 28 others.   Acting President Ghulam Ishaq Khan has said the crash was a``dastardly crime,'' but neither he nor any other official hasindicated who is to blame.   Zia made many enemies in his 11 years as the iron-fisted leaderof this nation of 107 million people in strategic central Asia. Healso was surrounded by unfriendly governments in India, Afghanistanand the Soviet Union.   Zia enraged the Moscow-backed, communist government ofAfghanistan by providing strong support to Moslem insurgentsfighting to overthrow Kabul. Pakistan was the conduit for theshipment of American and Saudi weapons to Afghan rebels who havebeen fighting a guerrilla war for nearly a decade.   Najib, Afghan's president, sent a condolence message to IshaqKhan that referred to the crash only as an incident and did notmention Zia by name.   A Western diplomatic source in Islamabad reported Tuesday thatKhad, the Afghan intelligence agency, and ``other (Kabul) regimesupporters spent the night of Aug. 17 celebrating President Zia'sdeath.''   Zia's support of the Afghan rebels also angered the SovietUnion, which has maintained troops in Afghanistan since 1979 insupport of Najib's government. Moscow, which is withdrawing itstroops, repeatedly has said Pakistan is providing assistance to theinsurgents in defiance of a U.N.-sponsored agreement reached thisyear to bring peace to Afghanistan.   Pakistan and its neighbor to the east, India, always have hadtense relations and have fought three wars in 41 years. New Delhiwas particularly concerned about reports, which Pakistan denied,that Zia's government was developing an atomic bomb.   But one Western diplomatic source, who demanded anonymity, notedthat India on several occasions ``has indicated it couldcommunicate with Zia.'' The source said New Delhi equated thePakistani leader with stability.   Zia's enemies at home included political opposition leaders,religious minorities and groups seeking autonomy.   Benazir Bhutto, the main opposition leader who heads thePakistan People's Party, has a personal grudge against Zia: Heexecuted her father in 1979.   Her father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was a populist prime ministerousted in a 1977 military coup led by Zia. Bhutto was hanged twoyears later for alleged with conspiracy to murder a politicalopponent.   Ms. Bhutto's party has been strongly critical of Zia,particularly his decision to forbid candidates from running asmembers of political parties in nationwide elections scheduled forNovember.   Another significant political opponent of Zia was Abdul WaliKhan, leader of the pro-Kabul Awami National Party.   Some members of the Moslem Shiite sect, which makes up 5 percentof the nation's population, disliked Zia for his religious andforeign policies.   Zia, a member of the majority Sunni sect, was the driving forcebehind instituting Moslem law in Pakistan. But hard-line Shiitesclaimed the program did not take into account their form ofjurisprudence.   Pakistan's Shiites also disapproved of Zia's close ties to theUnited States, which has had icy relations with Shiite-led Iran.   An English-language newspaper, the Muslim of Islamabad, reportedMonday that members of the minority sect blamed Zia for the deathof a Pakistani Shiite leader who was assassinated Aug. 5 whileleaving a mosque in the northwest frontier city of Peshawar. ArifHussain al-Hussaini headed an opposition political party, theMovement for Enforcement of Shia Jurisprudence.   More than 100 Shiites were arrested ``when they fired in the airto rejoice the deaths of (Zia and Raphel) because they felt thePakistan government and the Americans had a hand in the murder'' ofal-Hussaini, the newspaper said.   Sectarian strife broke out in the northwest frontier, the papersaid, when Shiites and Sunnis ``disputed whether to celebrate ormourn'' Zia's death.   Shiite groups denied that such celebrations took place.   Also dissatisfied with Zia were groups in the southern provinceof Sind who are seeking autonomy. The late president was fromnorthern Punjab province.   Some Sindhis have sought more economic autonomy to build uptheir province, which includes some extremely undeveloped regions.They claim the province is not fairly treated because Punjabisdominate the federal government.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Dan Biers covers Asia for The Associated Pressfrom Hong Kong, where he is news editor.</TEXT></DOC>
