Hardysays many of the millions of people who flooded her agency withphone calls last summer for a new personalized benefit statementhave not yet taken the trouble to complete the application.   ``More than 6 million people have asked us for the statement. Butonly 35 percent of them have sent it back to us,'' Hardy toldreporters Friday. ``It's still hanging on their refrigerators.''   The Social Security Administration had trouble fielding all thephone calls requesting its Personal Earnings and Benefit EstimateStatement (PEBES) when it became available in August.   But Hardy said the bottleneck on the phone lines has been clearedand ``we're ready, willing and able to provide them now. I wouldreally like to have everybody have a PEBES in their stocking.''   The toll-free number to call is 1-800-234-5772.   Operators are on hand to answer the calls at various SocialSecurity centers from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. local time on weekdays. Thosewho call after working hours or on weekends will get a recordingcapable of taking messages.   Once the form is mailed back, it takes the agency three weeks tocrank out the estimates of future monthly retirement benefits, aswell as how much a worker and family gets if he or she becomesdisabled or dies.   The agency also provides a year-by-year list of workers' wagesand Social Security taxes.   In other matters, Hardy said she and the Department of Health andHuman Services were unable to get included in President Reagan'sfiscal 1990 budget a proposal to eliminate a Social Security'searnings test.   The earnings test reduces benefits of beneficiaries under age 70who earn more than certain amounts. The thresholds this year are$8,400 for those ages 65-69 and $6,120 for those under 65; in 1989they are $8,880 and $6,480 respectively.   She also said, ``I'm hearing from seniors at town hall meetingsthat they are not pleased about the (income tax) surtax that'scoming'' to pay for Medicare's new catastrophic insurance benefit.   Hardy said she ``wouldn't be surprised'' if Congress took anotherlook at whether to levy the 15 percent tax surcharge on the elderlyto pay for the insurance, which starts in January.   Hardy wants all 130 million American workers to request theirearnings records at least once every three years both to ensuretheir wages were reported correctly, and to get a better idea ofwhat to expect from Social Security upon retirement.   Hardy hopes that people armed with that information will savemore and rely less on the government for their retirement income.   Currently, more than half the elderly rely on Social Security astheir main source of income. But the program was always intendedjust to be part of retirement income, she said.</TEXT></DOC>
