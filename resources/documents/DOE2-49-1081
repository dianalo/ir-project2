Program managers have focusedtheir attention on technological feasibility, an issue that becomes importantonly after agreement has been reached on the political and strategicgoals that technology is supposed to help achieve. Four fundamental questionsmust be addressed. First, how would a limited ballistic missile defense(BMD) system help deter nuclear war? Second, how likely is it that USdeployment of BMD will enable a transition to a world of offensive reductionsand defensive buildups aimed at mutual assured survival? Third, how willwe demonstrate to ourselves and the Soviets that is cheaper to developdefenses than to improve offenses to overwhelm them? And finally, whatwould be the full implications of the deployment of a vast array of weaponsin space. What the answers to these questions will tell us about thevalue of SDI is uncertain. But there is no doubt that these issues needmore careful study.</TEXT></DOC>
