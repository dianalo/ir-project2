USEPA is proposing to approve theselimits (shown in the table below) and Indiana's plan for Warrick County,if the limits are ultimately adopted by Indiana. This proposed approvalis based on the State's demonstrations of attainment and maintenance ofthe National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for SO<T2>2</T2>.

In addition, section 110(a)(2) of the Actrequires the State to adopt rules sufficient to assure attainment an maintenanceof the SO<T2>2</T2> NAAQS in the unclassifiable, e.g., Warrick County, and attainmentareas in the remainder of the State. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The primary SO<T2>2</T2> NAAQS is violated when, in a calendar year, either: (1) Theannual arithmetic mean value of SO<T2>2</T2> concentration exceeds 80 micrograms per cubic meter of air (80mg/m \3\) (the annual primary standard), or (2) the maximum 24-hour concentrationof SO<T2>3</T2> at any site exceeds 365 mg/m \3\ more than once (the 24-hourprimary standard). The seondary SO<T2>2</T2> NAAQS is violated when the maximum 3-hour concentration at anysite exceeds 1300 mg/m \3\ more than once. <ITAG tagnum="84">Status of Indiana SO<T2>2</T2> SIP </ITAG>On March 12, 1982 (47 FR 10813), and May 13, 1982 (47 FR 20583), USEPAapproved or conditionally approved Indiana's SO<T2>2</T2> SIP for most areas of the State. However, for Warrick County,USEPA disapproved Indiana's plan. On March 26, 1984 (49 FR 11197), USEPAnotified Indiana under section 110(a)(2)(H) that Indiana's SIP was substantiallyinadequate to assure the attainment and maintenance of the SO<T2>2</T2> NAAQS in Warrick County. In the 1982 rulemakings, USEPA took no action on one of three compliancemethods contained in Indiana's 1980 SO<T2>2</T2> regulation (325 IAC 7-1), i.e., the sulfer content in fuel averagingmethod which is based on 30-day averaging. On May 11, 1984, the U.S. Courtof Appeals for the Seventh Circuit set aside USEPA's approval of most ofthe SO<T2>2</T2> emission limits in Indiana's revised plan, because USEPA didnot rulemake on the 30-day averaging compliance method contained in therule. See <T3>Indiana andamp; Michigan Electric Company</T3> v. <T3>USEPA</T3>, 733 F.2d 489. Based on this decision and another recentdecision, <T3>Sierra Club</T3> v. <T3>Indiana-Kentucky Electric Company</T3>, 716 F.2d 1145 (7th Cir. 1983),USEPA determined that there were no federally enforceable SO<T2>2</T2> emission limits regulating most existing sources in Indianaand Indiana no longer had an approvable SO<T2>2</T2> plan. On February 4, 1987 (52 FR 3452), USEPA published a notice of proposedrulemaking on the Indiana SO<T2>2</T2> plan, including Indiana's SO<T2>2</T2> plan for Warrick County. That notice proposed to disapproveIndiana's overall SO<T2>2</T2> plan, because the 30-day averaging compliance methodology inthe rule (325 IAC 7-1-3) was inconsistent with protection of the 3-hourand 24-hour SO<T2>2</T2> NAAQS; and the stack test methodology, which is consistent withshort-term emission limits, was not independently enforceable. For 77 ofIndiana's 92 counties, this was the only basis for the proposed disapprovalof Indiana's SO<T2>2</T2> plan.\2\<NOTE/> For the remaining 15 counties, including Warrick County,technical deficiencies were noted as well.\3\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ These 77 counties are: Adams, Allen, Bartholomew, Benton,Blackford, Boone, Brown, Carroll, Cass, Clark, Clay, Clinton, Crawford,Daviess, Decatur, De Kalb, Delaware, Dubois, Elkhart, Fayette, Fountain,Franklin, Fulton, Grant, Greene, Hamilton, Hancock, Harrison, Hendricks,Henry, Howard, Huntington, Jackson, Jasper, Jay, Jennings, Johnson, Knox,Kosciusko, LaGrange, Lawrence, Madison, Marshall, Martin, Miami, Monroe,Montgomery, Newton, Noble, Ohio, Orange, Owen, Parke, Perry, Pike, Pulaski,Putham, Randolph, Ripley, Rush, St. Joseph, Scott, Shelby, Spencer, Starke,Steuben, Switzerland, Tippecanoe, Tipton, Union, Vanderburgh, Wabash, Warren,Washington, Wells, White, and Whitley. All of these counties are designated``Better than National Standards'' for SO<T2>2</T2> (40 CFR 81.315). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\  The remaining 15 counties are: Dearborn, Floyd, Gibson,Jefferson, Lake, La Porte, Marion, Morgan, Porter, Posey, Sullivan, Vermillion,Vigo, Warrick, and Wayne Counties. USEPA proposed rulemaking on eight ofthese counties on March 13, 1988, (Jefferson, La Porte, Marion, Posey,Sullivan, Vermillion, Vigo, and Wayne) (53 FR 6845). USEPA has recentlyproposed, or will soon propose, rulemaking on two of these counties (Floydand Morgan). Today, USEPA is proposing rulemaking for Warrick County. Itwill rulemake on the remaining four counties (Gibson, Dearborn, Lake, andPorter) in future notices. USEPA's February 4, 1987, notice indicated that correction of the identifieddeficiency in the compliance methodology rule would allow USEPA to reinstateits March 12, 1982 (47 FR 10813), final approval for these 77 counties.On March 12, 1987, Indiana submitted to USEPA for ``parallel processing''\4\<NOTE/> its proposed revised compliance methodology rule, 325 IAC7-1-3.1, as preliminarily adopted by the Board on March 4, 1987.\5\<NOTE/> The revised compliance methodology rule replaces 325 IAC7-1-3 in the 1980 version of 325 IAC 7-1. The revised rule includes a stacktest compliance method and either a 30-day or a calendar month averagingfuel analysis method (depending upon the size of the source), each of whichmay be used at any time to determine compliance or non-compliance withsource emission limitations.\6\<NOTE/> However, a determination of non-compliance through the useof one method cannot be refuted by evidence of compliance through the othermethod. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ The generic procedures for ``parallel processing'' aredescribed at 47 FR 22073 (June 7, 1982). The State and USEPA propose rulemakingat roughly the same time, announce concurrent comment periods, and jointlyreview public comments. The State and USEPA then coordinate resolutionof any deficiencies prior to the State's final adoption of the rule. Ifthe State's rule, as finally adopted, is substantially identical to theproposed rule, the USEPA will take final action on the rule shortly followingits submittal to USEPA. On the other hand, if the final rule is substantiallydifferent than the proposed rule, then USEPA may publish a rulemaking noticereproposing action, as necessary. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ For the exact language of 325 IAC 7-1-3.1, see 52 FR 17017(July 17, 1987). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ Although the rule contains a 30-day averaging compliancemethodology for certain sources and monthly averaging for others, for purposesof this notice, this combination of methodologies will be referred to as``30-day averaging''. In accordance with the February 4, 1987, proposed rulemaking notice, onJuly 17, 1987 (52 FR 27016), USEPA (1) proposed for parallel processingto approve 325 IAC 7-1-3.1 statewide, because it provides for the independentuse of stack testing to determine compliance with the SO<T2>2</T2> emission limits in 325 IAC 7-1; (2) proposed to reinstate theother provisions of 325 IAC 7-1 statewide, except for any emission limitsfor the 15 counties; and (3) proposed to reinstate its approval of Indiana'splan for the 77 counties, based on the revised compliance methodology.On October 21, 1987, Indiana submitted 325 IAC 7-1-3.1, as promulgatedby the State on September 24, 1987. Because this rule was substantiallyidentical to the rule that USEPA proposed to approve on July 17, 1987,on January 19, 1988 (53 FR 1354), USEPA approved this rule for inclusioninto the Indiana SO<T2>2</T2> SIP statewide; reinstated the other general provisions of 325IAC 7-1 (1980), i.e., 325 IAC 7-1-1, 2 (except for any emission limitsin the 15 counties, including Warrick County), 4, 5, 6, and 7 statewide;and, based on its approval of the revised compliance methodology, reinstatedits approval of Indiana's SO<T2>2</T2> plan for the 77 counties. Indiana has also submitted county-specific plans for several other counties,including Warrick County. These plans consist of source-specific emissionlimits for certain sources, with the remainder of the sources in each countylimited by 6.0 pounds per million British Thermal Units (lbs/MMBTU) emissionlimit in 325 IAC 7-1-2.\7\<NOTE/> Additionally, all sources are required to meet the remainingrequirements of 325 IAC 7-1, as modified with new compliance methodology325 IAC 7-1-3.1. (As noted before, on January 19, 1988, the general requirementsof 325 IAC 7-1 (with the exception of the 6.0 lbs/MMBTU emission limitin 325 IAC 7-1-2) were reinstated as a portion of the Indiana SO<T2>2</T2> SIP for all counties and new compliance methodology 325 IAC7-1-3.1 was approved for all counties.)<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\Indiana has recently recodified its rules from Title 325to Title 326. All rules in today's notice will be codified under Title326 when submitted instead of 325. This in no way affects the substanceof the rules, and USEPA will take final action upon them using the codificationin which they are promulgated and submitted by the State.<ITAG tagnum="84">Indiana's Proposed Plans for Warrick County</ITAG>Today USEPA is proposing action on Indiana's SO<T2>2</T2> plan for Warrick County. This plan consists of the source-specificemission limits and the other requirements in 326 IAC 7-1-17 (as preliminaryadopted by the Indiana Air Pollution Control Board (IAPCB) and submittedby the State for parallel processing on July 21, 1988), the remainder ofthe sources in each county limited by the 6.0 lbs/MMBTU emission limitis 325 IAC 7-1-2, and the other requirements of 325 IAC 7-1, as modifiedwith new compliance methodology 325 IAC 7-1-3.1.USEPA is proposing to approve Indiana's plan for Warrick County and 326IAC 7-1-17, if these limits are submitted to USEPA as a State adopted rule.This rule consists of Base and Optional Sets of emission limits. In theBase Set, source-specific emission limits are established for ALCOA_WarrickPower Station and ALCOA_Smelter Operations; Southern Indiana Gas and ElectricCompany's (SIGECO)_Culley Power Plant is given the discretion to vary itsemission limits for units 1, 2, and 3 between two discrete operating alternatives,described more fully in the table below, provided that IDEM and USEPA arenotified by certified mail at least 14 days in advance of any change. USEPAis considering whether 14 days provides sufficient advance notificationand solicits comment on the adequacy of this period and other periods oftime.Under the Optional Set of alternative emission limits, SIGECO must selectone set of emission limits from among the three alternative combinationslisted in the table below, and may not vary emission limits among themonce the limits are selected. ALCOA_Warrick Power Station and SIGECO mustjointly notify IDEM and USEPA prior to December 1, 1989 of their intentionto rely on a specified set of emission limits. Under the Base and Optionalscenarios, emission limits for ALCOA's smelter operations remain fixed.<ITAG tagnum="85">Table of Emissions for Warrick County As Preliminarily Adopted byIAPCB, July 21, 1988</ITAG>Base Set of Emission Limits<ITAG tagnum="81">ALCOA_Warrick Power Plant:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">6.0 lbs/MMBTU prior to August 1, 1991</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">5.11 lbs/MMBTU beginning August 1, 1991, and afterward </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">ALCOA_Smelter Operations</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Potline 1 Stacks: 176.3 lbs/hour</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Potline 1 Roof Monitors: 19.6 lbs/hours</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Potline 2-6 Stacks: 195.2 lbs/hour each</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Potline 2-6 Roof Monitors: 21.7 lbs/hour each</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Potline 1-6 Combined: 5608 tons/year</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Anode Bake Ring Furnace: 94.1 lbs/hour; 412 tons/year\8\</ITAG><NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ The emission limits for the ring furnace in all of theplans are approvable in the context of the SIP attainment demonstration.Because this source has applied for a Prevention a Significant Deterioration(PSD) permit, however, the State has correctly included a condition inthe rule that the limits established in a PSD permit will supersede themodeled SIP limits, if the permit limits are more stringent.<ITAG tagnum="81">SIGECO_Culley Power Plant:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">6.0 lbs/MMBTU prior to December 31, 1989</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">5.41 lbs/MMBTU beginning December 31, 1989, and until August 1, 1991</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">2.79 lbs/MMBTU (unit 1), 2.79 lbs/MMBTU (Unit 2), and 5.41 lbs/MMBTU(Unit 3) beginning August 1, 1991, and afterward.</ITAG>As an alternative to the August 1, 1991, limits, SIGECO may at any time(provided the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) andUSEPA are both notified by certified mail at least 14 days in advance)operate under the emission limits (lbs/MMBTU) in the following scenario:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,tp0,i1,10,10,10</C> <H1>Unit 1</H1><H1>Unit 2</H1><H1>Unit 3</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">0.0006<D>4.40</D><D>5.41</D></ITAG></ITAG>Optional Set of Emission Limits<ITAG tagnum="81">ALCOA_Warrick Power Plant:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">5.4 lbs/MMBTU</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">ALCOA_Smelter Operations</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Same as in Base Set</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">SIGECO_Culley Power Plant_Three Alternatives:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,tp0,i1,s10,2.4,2.4,10</C> <H1> </H1><H1>Unit 1</H1><H1>Unit 2</H1><H1>Unit 3</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">(i)<D>0.0006</D><D>3.2</D><D>5.4</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">(ii)<D>2.0</D><D>2.0</D><D>5.4</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">(iii)<D>5.4</D><D>0.0006</D><D>5.4</D></ITAG></ITAG>Joint Notification and Selection of Final Limits  In order to make these limits the effective State (and SIP) limits, SIGECOand ALCOA must jointly provide notification via certified mail to IDEMand USEPA prior to December 1, 1989, of their intention to begin to relypermanently on one of the sets of limits specified in the optional setof emission limits in the table above. The written notification shall containa notarized agreement between SIGECO and ALCOA concerning the applicableset of limits.  In each of the optional scenarios, units subject to emission limits of5.4 lb/MMBTU shall achieve compliance by December 31, 1989, while unitssubject to emission limits of 3.2 lb/MMBTU or less shall comply with aninterim emission limit of 5.4 lb/MMBTU by December 31, 1989, and shallachieve final compliance by August 1, 1991.Stack Test IssuesRule 325 IAC 7-1-3.1, which contains both independently enforceable stacktest and 30-day averaging fuel analysis compliance methodologies, is applicablein Warrick County. The Warrick County rules clarify how compliance determinationswill be made using the 30-day averaging provision within 325 IAC 7-1-3.1in the county, if SIGECO switches operating scenarios among the alternativesprovided in the Base Set of limits. The stack test procedures in 325 IAC7-1-3.1 provide a testing methodology consistent with the 3-hour standard.USEPA finds the State's application of these methodologies acceptable.A short discussion of Warrick County and USEPA's proposed action follow.Additionally, technical support documents more fully explaining this planare available at the addresses listed in the front of this notice.Warrick CountyAs discussed above, five sets of emission limitations for ALCOA and SIGECOCulley are under consideration here. The State has performed some additionalanalyses to supplement the 1984 modeling analysis discussed in USEPA'sFebruary 4, 1987, rulemaking action and to correct the technical deficienciesidentified by USEPA. (See ``Warrick County SO<T2>2</T2> Modeling Analysis'', April 1988 and the July 1988 addendum).The additional modeling analyses used to supplement the 1984 attainmentdemonstration attempt to follow the modeling guidelines which were in-placeat the time of the earlier modeling (i.e., ``Guideline on Air Quality Models'',April 1978 and ``Regional Workshops on Air Quality Modeling: A SummaryReport'' April 1981, with addenda). Since that time, USEPA has promulgatedrevisions to its modeling guidelines (i.e., September 9, 1986, publicationof ``Guideline on Air Quality Models (Revised)'', July 1986 and January6, 1988, publication of ``Supplement A to the Guideline on Air QualityModels (Revised)'', July 1987). USEPA policy generally requires that whenadditional modeling is performed, such modeling be consistent with thecurrent modeling guidance. In the case of Warrick County the State's additionalmodeling followed the modeling guidelines in place in 1984. Because themodeling was generally completed prior to the latest revisions, USEPA isproposing to accept Indiana's analysis.On May 10, 1988, the IDEM submitted a modeling analysis consistent withthe guidelines that were applicable in 1984 (e.g., calm hour concentrationsexcluded).\9\<NOTE/> An addendum to this analysis was submitted in July 1988.These analyses are discussed further below.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ The State's technical support document for its May 10,1988, submittal also discusses a second modeling analysis performed withcalm hour concentrations included. Because this ``calms in'' approach isnot consistent with the guidelines that were applicable in 1984, USEPAcannot accept this second modeling analysis. See the calms policy portionof Joseph Tikvart's June 13, 1983, memorandum entitled ``Regional MeteorologistsWorkshop, May 1983''. USEPA's proposed approval today is based only onthe ``calms out'' modeling analysis.USEPA cited two major deficiencies with the SIP for Warrick County in itsFebruary 4, 1987, proposed rulemaking: (1) The compliance test methodswere inconsistent with the attainment of the short-term SO<T2>2</T2> NAAQS, and (2) the State's modeled attainment demonstrationcontained several technical deficiencies, as discussed further below.<ITAG tagnum="84">30-Day Averaging Compliance Test Method</ITAG>On October 21, 1987, the State submitted a revised compliance test methodrule (325 IAC 7-1-3.1). On January 19, 1988, USEPA approved this rule forall 92 counties in Indiana (see 53 FR 1354). Thus, this compliance issuehas been resolved.The technical deficiencies cited in USEPA's February 4, 1987, proposedrulemaking, along with the State's corrective action, are summarized below:<ITAG tagnum="84">Lack of Emission Limits for ALCOA Process Sources</ITAG>The revised rule(s) and the State's modeling analyses for Warrick Countyinclude emission limits for the process sources (smelting operations) atALCOA.<ITAG tagnum="84">Modeled Violations Are Predicted Over Land on ALCOA Property</ITAG>This deficiency is unresolved. IDEM still has not certified that ALCOAhas erected fences around areas of its property which would otherwise beopen to the public. According to USEPA's ambient air policy, 40 CFR 50.1(e),\1\\0\<NOTE/> the NAAQS do not apply over company property if public accessis precluded by a fence or other physical barrier. Although the State hasinformally notified USEPA that such a barrier has been erected, USEPA requeststhe State to provide formal notification along with supporting documentationduring the public comment period.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\ This policy was discussed in a December 19, 1980, letterfrom then Administrator Douglas Costle to Senator Jennings Randolph.<ITAG tagnum="85">Failure To Consider Building Downwash for Sigeco-Culley and ALCOASources, Incomplete Background Analysis, and Uncertain Application of CalmCorrection Procedure</ITAG>In response to these three issues, IEM recreated the 1984 modeling analysisusing the Industrial Source Complex (ISC) model with the following changes:(a) Building downwash considered for certain SIGECO and ALCOA sources,with calms corrected for with the CALMPRO post-processor (i.e., consistentwith the applicable guidelines, calm hour concentrations were excludedin the calculation of 3-hour and 24-hour concentrations) (b) anemometerheight set to 6.1 meters (m), not 10 m, which was erroneously used before,and (c) background SO<T2>2</T2> concentrations accounted for, using the State's background program.The State's modeling, discussed in a technical support document preparedby the State entitled ``Warrick County SO<T2>2</T2> Analysis'', April 1988, is summarized below.<T3>Emission Inventory:</T3> The point source inventory consisted of CulleyStacks 1,2,3; ALCOA Power Plant Stacks 1,2,3; ALCOA Potline Stacks 1,2,3,4,5,6and the ALCOA Ring Furnace Stack. Each set of emission limits was modeled.Stacks below the good engineering practice (GEP) formula height were modeledfor building downwash.<T3>Receptor Grid:</T3> Receptors were excluded from fenced company propertyconsistent with USEPA's ambient air policy. USEPA notes that no receptorswere located over the Ohio River, consistent with Regional policy at thetime the underlying modeling was performed (in 1984). In a letter datedSeptember 4, 1985, Region V notified the State that all new actions withmodeling analysis submitted after January 1, 1986, must include receptorsover water. In its public comments dated May 4, 1987, IDEM noted that theWarrick County SIP was initially submitted in February 1985 and should,therefore, be based on the Regional guidance outstanding at that time.Even though USEPA is today acting on a plan recently submitted by IDEM,USEPA recognizes that this plan and the associated modeling are a continuationof the 1985 submittal. For this reason USEPA proposes not to require receptorsover the Ohio River for the purpose of this SIP effort and today's rulemakingactions. USEPA wishes to make clear, however, that USEPA's proposed approvalof the analyses for the plan today, which do not address receptors overwater, will not apply to any other analysis of the Warrick County area(or any other area) used to support any future regulatory action.<T3>Model Results:</T3> The State's ``calms out'' modeling analysis (i.e.,the analysis proposed today by USEPA as being consistent with the 1984USEPA modeling guidelines) predicts that each of the alternative sets ofemission limits contained in the Warrick County Plan (See Table, above)will result in concentrations below the 3-hour, 24-hour and annual NAAQS.Thus, USEPA proposes to approve each of the alternative sets of limits.<T3>Attainment Date:</T3> USEPA accepts the State's determination thatthe final compliance date of August 1, 1991, for SIGECO and ALCOA meetsthe requirement of the Clean Air Act.\1\\1\<NOTE/> Based on its proposed approval of the compliance date forSIGECO and ALCOA, USEPA also proposes to approve the final attainment dateof August 1, 1991, for the Warrick County plan.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\1\ Warrick County is currently designated unclassifiablefor SO<T2>2</T2>. Section 110 of the Clean Air Act requires attainment of theprimary NAAQS as expeditiously as practicable, but no later than threeyears from the date of approval of the plan, and attainment of the secondaryNAAQS within a reasonable time.<ITAG tagnum="84">Additional Issues</ITAG>Pursuant to section 123 of the Clean Air Act, USEPA has promulgated regulationswhich restrict credit for stacks of sources in existence, and dispersiontechniques implemented on or after December 31, 1970. IDEM has reviewedall sources in Warrick County and has documented that all sources and stackswere modeled consistently with these regulations.Also Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) increment consumptionis not an issue, because the revision establishes Federal emission limitswhere none now exist. Thus, approval of the base Indiana Warrick Countyplan is not expected to increase actual (baseline) emissions and does notconsume PSD increment. See 45 FR 52735 (August 7, 1980). Under the alternativeemission limits, however, actual emissions from some sources may increase(and others may decrease) as a result of the variability afforded to ALCOAand SIGECO. Because the net effect of these emission changes cannot beestimated at this time, USEPA requests IDEM to identify during the publiccomment period how it will address PSD increment consumption under theseconditions.Finally the modeling included receptors in Kentucky, the only other statewithin 50 km., which is the normal range for USEPA's reference models.All of the combination of limits in the Table will result in attainmentin Kentucky. Thus the requirements of section 110(a)(2)(E) has been met.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary</ITAG>The July 21, 1988, plan being considered is approvable because the State'smodeling analyses (which are consistent with the modeling guidelines thatwere applicable in 1984 and Region V guidance) demonstrate attainment andmaintenance of the SO<T2>2 </T2>NAAQS. USEPA proposes to approve the plans preliminarily adoptedby the Indiana Air Pollution Control Board on July 21, 1988, provided thatit is ultimately adopted by the State. (Under USEPA's parallel processingprocedures, a Warrick County-specific rule must be fully State adopted,enforceable, and submitted as such as a revision to Indiana's SO<T2>2 </T2>SIP before USEPA can take final rulemaking action on it.)The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof section 3 of Executive Order 12291.
