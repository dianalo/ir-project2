There were no reports of injuries or damage from Tuesday night'squake, according to police.   The temblor measured 4.5 on the Richter scale, said PaulDelaney, a geologist at the U.S. Geological Survey's HawaiianVolcano Observatory,   The earthquake, which struck at 10:42 p.m. (3:42 a.m. ESTtoday), was centered six miles below the surface of the volcano tothe southwest of where lava has been pouring from the Earth sincethe summer of 1986, Delaney said.   The quake was not strong enough to generate a Pacific-widetsunami, or tidal wave, according to the Pacific Tsunami WarningCenter in Honolulu.   ``It didn't even rattle the china,'' Delaney said.   The volcano on Hawaii Island began erupting Jan. 3, 1983,although some early phases were marked by the underground movementof lava.   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded onseismographs.   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slightdamage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage,6 severe damage.</TEXT></DOC>
