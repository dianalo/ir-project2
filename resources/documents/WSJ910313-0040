The court's action is the latest chapter in a nine-yearinvestigation. Mr. De Benedetti was deputy chairman ofAmbrosiano for 65 days in late 1981 and early 1982. The bankcollapsed in August 1982 with $1.3 billion in debts. ThatJune, the bank's chairman, Roberto Calvi, was found hangedunder a London bridge.</LP><TEXT>   The indictment followed an appeal by prosecutor PierluigiDell'Osso against a March 1989 ruling by Milan magistratesthat cleared Mr. De Benedetti of wrongdoing in connectionwith the bank's failure. But the appeals court rejected theprosecutor's allegation that extortion was involved.   Mr. De Benedetti issued a statement describing theindictment as &quot;extremely unjust, with no legal or factualbasis.&quot; It said he hadn't left Banco Ambrosiano voluntarilybut had been forced out by Mr. Calvi and insisted thatneither he nor his companies had made any profit from hisdeparture.   Conviction of involvement in fraudulent bankruptcy carriesa maximum prison sentence of 15 years. No date has been setfor the trial, but it is expected to take place this year.   The renewed accusation comes at a difficult time for theItalian entrepreneur's businesses. His control overpublishing house Arnoldo Mondadori Editore S.p.A.,established with difficulty last summer, has been eroded by aseries of court rulings favorable to his arch rival, SilvioBerlusconi. And computer company Ing. C. Olivetti andamp; Co.,where Mr. De Benedetti is chairman and owns a 42% stake, isexpected to post sharply lower 1990 earnings next month,which would be its fourth successive annual profit drop.   The court's interest focuses on two transactionsassociated with Mr. De Benedetti's departure from Ambrosiano.Mr. De Benedetti purchased one million Ambrosiano shares for52 billion Italian lire ($44 million) when he joined thebank, subsequently selling them to a finance company,Italmobiliare S.p.A., for 54.3 billion lire. And Ambrosianoextended 27 billion lire in credit that enabled an Italianfamily-owned industrial company, Cabassi Group, to purchasetwo companies from Mr. De Benedetti's Cie. IndustrialeRiunite holding company.   Mr. De Benedetti repeatedly has said that the 2.3 billionlire gain on the Ambrosiano share sale simply representedinterest and expenses, and Cabassi has repaid with interestthe credit extended by the bank for the purchase of the twoDe Benedetti businesses.   &quot;Banco Ambrosiano's financial situation did not,therefore, suffer any damage whatsoever upon my exit . . . asin fact has already been declared by the Civil Court ofMilan, which rejected all the claims made against me by theliquidators and ordered them to pay the legal expenses,&quot; Mr.De Benedetti said yesterday. &quot;Consequently, there is a totallack of the elements that would constitute a crime.&quot;   Mr. De Benedetti has consistently denied any wrongdoing inconnection with Ambrosiano. In fact, he says he was the onlyboard member to openly challenge Mr. Calvi's secretivemanagement methods and was frustrated in his repeated demandsfor information.   The failure of Ambrosiano sent shock waves through theItalian banking system, and a separate trial is under way inMilan involving former officials and associates of the bank.The bank failed when it couldn't collect $1.3 billion inloans made to 10 Panamanian shell companies. The Vaticanbank, offically called the Institute for Religious Works,controlled the shell companies and had issued letters ofguarantee for the loans.   The Vatican bank was also the largest shareholder in BancoAmbrosiano. In 1984, it agreed to pay $250 million as part ofBanco Ambrosiano's bankruptcy settlement but said the paymentwasn't an admission of responsibility. Italian courts ruledin 1988 that a treaty between Italy and the Vatican preventedthe prosecution of three Vatican bank officials, includingArchbishop Paul Marcinkus, an American who then headed theVatican bank.</TEXT></DOC>
