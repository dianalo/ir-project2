<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-60-0012 </DOCNO><TEXT>A computerized data acquisition system has been developed and employedin sensing of gas metal arc welding (GMAW). Ultrasonic measurements ofthe weld-pool geometry have been made using expert-systems techniquesto discriminate among the molten/solid interface geometries found duringthe root pass in a V-groove in carbon steel. A similar system was usedto acquire video data from the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory(INEL) weld vision system and to measure the width of a weld pool asthe welding parameters were systematically varied. The system is basedon a CAMAC (Computer Automated Measurement and Control) crate controlledby an LSI 11/73 computer. The chief advantage of the CAMAC system isthe ease of making both hardware and software changes. The CAMAC systemprovides a robust, well isolated interface for a large variety of dataacquisition and control modules. In these applications transient digitizerscollect the data (ultrasonic A scan or video line scan) under the controlof the computer. The computer also collects information from timing andencoder modules in the CAMAC crate. Because the single software driverfor the CAMAC system is the same for all modules, programming changescan be made in a higher level language (e.g., FORTRAN) rather than inassembler language. 7 refs., 13 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
