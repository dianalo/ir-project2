PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The state Legislature should establish thenation's first American Indian-run urban school district to focus onthe special educational needs of native American children, a groupof educators recommends.   The 15-member Indian School Council, created by the Legislaturelast February, recently submitted a preliminary report recommendingthat the special district open a school in the Twin Cities by thefall of 1990.   Minnesota's Indian children, who have had some of the publicschool system's lowest test scores and highest dropout rates, wouldnot be required to attend the school. But the council said itbelieves the Twin Cities' Indian community would overwhelminglysupport such a school, which they anticipate would be three-quartersIndian.   Supporters of the plan say they hope an Indian-run school thatputs the needs of Indians first will instill self-confidence andpride in students about their Indian heritage and reduce the streamof dropouts from public schools.   The supporters also say an Indian-controlled school wouldencourage support from Indian parents, who traditionally have seeneducation as a tool of white society to separate them from theirIndian identity.   ``The idea is to make what is public about public educationcloser to the constituents' students,'' said David Beaulieu,director of Indian education for the state Department of Educationand a member of the Indian School Council. ``You can change thechild to fit the school, or you can change the school to fit thechild.''   ``It's real clear that public education is not working well for alot of American Indians,'' he said. ``So I'm in favor of anythingthat I can be convinced will increase student achievement.''   The Legislature opened the door for the creation of an urbanIndian-run school district when it created the Indian School Councilduring the past session.   But the report arrives at a time when metropolitan schooldistricts are wrestling with the question of how to desegregate, andthe idea of a predominantly Indian school flies in the face of thatideal.   Indian-run reservation schools are commonplace, but an Indian-runpublic school in an urban setting would be unique and involvemeshing the tenets of mainstream education with traditional Indianideas, such as the study of tribal law and culture.   Such a school would place Indian concerns first because themajority of students in this case would be composed of Indians, saidDon Allery, chairman of the Indian School Council and tribalhistorian for the Red Lake Indian Reservation.   ``Who controls the system is who dictates the priorities,''Allery said last week.   But the Indian School Council was not unanimous in itsrecommendation of the school proposal.   St. Paul School Board member Eleanor Weber, who sat on thecouncil as a representative of her school board, says theLegislature should consider alternatives, such as creating an Indianmagnet school in an existing school district, recruiting more Indianteachers, and beefing up funding for existing Indian educationprograms.   ``The viewpoint I have heard is that there is somethinginherently beneficial about the education of Indians by Indians,''she said. ``Now, I have yet to see the evidence.''   The report's authors say they envision a school that includesgrades K-12 located in the metropolitan area. No site or evenpreferred city was named in the report.   Minneapolis has the metro area's largest concentration of Indianstudents _ slightly less than 3,000 or about 7.5 percent of its39,500 total student population. St. Paul has about 900 Indianstudents, or 3 percent of its 33,000 student body.   The report does not set the school's size, but estimates bysupporters have ranged from 500 to 3,000 students.</TEXT></DOC>
