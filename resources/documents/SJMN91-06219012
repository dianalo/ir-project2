But he said thegovernment would not use one of its most potent legal weapons to prosecute thefirms because of a technicality in how the securities were traded.;    For taxpurposes, much of the trading took place in London, which was just a phonecall away for Tokyo traders. The transactions were not done on a formalexchange, but on an active market in which prices were quoted by variousbrokers and dealers.;    Matsuno said that since the trading did not takeplace on a formal exchange, it was impossible to determine if the trading wasreally conducted at artificial prices.;    &quot;We didn't have a real market, sowe didn't have any market prices,&quot; Matsuno said. &quot;So theoretically, securitiesfirms can sell or buy at any price.&quot;;    This was the second loophole theFinance Ministry has opened for the securities houses, whose activities havecreated a major and still widening scandal.;    Nearly all of Japan's majorsecurities houses have admitted improper payments to compensate favoredclients for stock market losses. More than $1 billion was paid to hundreds ofJapan's top companies, public pension funds and a few individuals.;    In thefirst loophole, the Finance Ministry maintained it could not prosecute thefirms for those payments because, although the law prohibits promisingloss-compensation, it does not expressly ban making the payments.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Mercury News Wire Services  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Tokyo  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910806  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  August  </MONTH><PG.COL>  2C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  334  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday August 6, 199100219012,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
