LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A former policeman convicted in a pension fundscandal surrendered after holding a police official hostage atgunpoint for 15 hours and then keeping authorities at bay fornearly 10 hours more.   Anthony Daniele, 39, claimed that he was willing to die to showhe was innocent of involvement in a scheme to defraud the policepension fund.   ``If I had been involved in something like that, I shouldn't goto jail, I should be shot,'' Daniele said in an interview with anewspaper columnist shortly before he surrendered Sunday.   Daniele, who was sentenced Friday to eight years in prison, tookJohn Frank, vice president of the city police board, hostage about10:30 a.m. Saturday. Daniele was free on bond pending appeal.   Frank had been instrumental in exposing the kickback scheme thatcost police and fire pension funds an estimated $330,000. Danieleformerly headed the police pension fund.   Besides the prison sentence, Daniele was ordered to makerestitution of $200,000. He was one of six men indicted but theonly one to stand trial; the others pleaded guilty to lessercharges.   The ordeal began when Daniele walked into Frank's law office onthe 15th floor of a downtown office building, displayed a.38-caliber revolver and took Frank hostage.   Daniele apparently wanted to convince Frank of his innocence andget media attention for what he regarded as an injustice in hisconviction and sentence, officials said.   The former policeman released Frank at about 1:30 a.m. Sunday.He ended the standoff at about 11 a.m. after reaching agreementwith police that he would not be charged in the hostage-taking,said his lawyer, Donald Wolff.   U.S. Attorney Thomas E. Dittmeier said it was his decision notto prosecute Daniele. But Circuit Attorney George Peach said he hadmade no promises and would have to review the case before making adecision.   Before surrendering, Daniele asked to speak to Bill McClellan, acolumnist for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch who had covered thepolice department and had written about the pension fund case.   ``I should be hung. I wanted my brother officers to know I'minnocent. I was willing to die to let them know it. I was willingto go out of here in a body bag,'' Daniele told McClellan.   Daniele was taken to the medical facility at the federalpenitentiary in Springfield, Mo., where he will undergo apsychiatric evaluation, authorities said. Wolff said Daniele wasremorseful about the hostage-taking.   Dozens of police officers and firefighters surrounded the officebuilding during the standoff while a team of negotiators kept intouch with Daniele by telephone from another floor of the building.   Reports that Daniele might have a bomb or had booby-trapped thedoor to Frank's office with explosives turned out to be false,police said. But the police team's work was complicated by the factthat Daniele, an 18-year police veteran and former rifleman on thehostage team, knew their techniques.</TEXT></DOC>
