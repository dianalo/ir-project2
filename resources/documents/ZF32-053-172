IBM doesn't make major announcements for thebenefit of the IBM-watching fraternity: they are a personal matter betweenIBM and its consenting users in private? Quite right.andP;  IBM doesn't needintermediaries to explain itself and its directions to users: that is what ithas highly-paid sales representatives for.andP;  Well that might do for publicconsumption.andP;  But if the people that have all the time in the world to sitaround and do nothing but reflect on IBM's outpourings find that the task isbeyond them, how is the poor user, who has to try to get to grips with allthe new offerings in between the deadly serious business of running a largeand demanding installation day-to-day, expected to begin to master such anintolerably onerous brief.andP;  Consider that IBM's 100 product blitz came just aweek after a major AS/400 announcement, and one that is of considerableimportance to MVS users, who are beginning to look on baby AS/400s asappropriate machines to distribute in remote locations.andP;  What made the IBMself-indulgence even more unforgivable was that apart from the big diskdrives, almost nothing in the announcement is deliverable until well intonext year - and much of it is a full 12 months away.andP;  It may have suitedIBM's convenience to get the whole lot out of the way in one insultingexpectoration, but it was emphatically not to the benefit of the people thatin the last analysis put up the money for IBM's entire payroll, the poorbenighted user.andP;  A reasonable company would have confined the September 11announcement to the new Summit mainframes, the new 3390 disk drives and theadditional functionality - extensions to Escon and such - that relateddirectly to the core of the announcement.andP;  Even the new 9121s could have keptto another Tuesday and with them the two new smaller disk drive offerings.andO;Throwing in AIX/ESA as well makes it clear that IBM regards Unix on themainframe as a very bad joke that it hopes everyone will forget about beforethe leaves have fallen - and even that misfired because the only aspect ofthe announcement that was reported by the utterly bemused New York Times andthe Financial Times was - Unix on the mainframe!andM;Data dustbinsandM;It is axiomatic that complex software announcements - Warehouses,Repositories and sundry other data dustbins, evolutions of SystemsApplication Architecture, AD/Cycle and such - have to be presented andassessed in a calm atmosphere unsullied by the need to rush something intoprint, the need to do the exacting sums on whether the data processing budgetwill actually run to a new Summit in June next year and whether the thingshould be leased or bought outright or financed in some other way.andP;  EarlyNovember would have been soon enough to unleash those announcements on aslow-to-comprehend world - after all the networking announcements had beengot out of the way on a mid-October Tuesday.andP;  Once again the suspicion - andit's rife - has to be that Systems Application Architecture as originallyconceived is falling apart, IBM has no more idea of what people want and needin the way of software engineering that users themselves do, and that thecompany's entire macro software strategy is in complete chaos, with therebeing no chance that all the weird and wonderful technologies being broughtin from third parties will ever work together or live up to their promise.andO;That may all be untrue, but if that is the impression that the user communityand the industry-watchers have come away with, it will be a self-fulfillingprophecy.andP;  While declaring 1988 the Year of the Customer, IBM has nevertreated its users with much respect, constantly pursuing architectural,product and software strategies that put tripping up the competition orderailing industry standards - like X25 - that IBM doesn't want to support atthe top of the list of priorities, manufacturing as cheaply as possible next(no reboot button on the original Personal Computer, a contemptuouslyinadequate keyboard buffer in contrast to every cheapo CP/M machine of thetime), and the true benefit of the user nowhere.andP;  IBM has always taken theattitude that its mainframe customers will follow it down whatever route itmaps out, will somehow get to grips with whatever it announces, no matter howdifficult it makes that process, because they have no alternative: all youhad to do to bring a stroppy customer to heel was to suggest that if that wasthe way he felt, well the number of the nearest Burroughs Corp sales officewas to be found in the phone book.andM;Let 100 flowers bloomandM;IBM could make life as difficult as it liked for its mainframe users becausethere was nowhere else for them to go.andP;  But every additional layer ofcomplexity that the company tries to build onto the wholly inadequatestructure of System 360 and OS/360, the closer it hastens the day when withthe best will in the world even its most loyal customers will admit defeatand ask wearily whether it all really has to be this complicated.andP;  Andsuddenly, it doesn't.andP;  The siren call to the brave new world of open systemssounds ever louder, and slowly all the appendages that are lacking in Unixare being built in.andP;  There is no way that the typical four-square MVS usercan yet think of shipping the iron to the scrapheap and downsizing to Unix -but there is already every reason for such users to consider implementinganything completely new under Unix and putting the mainframe applications ona care and maintenance basis until Unix catches up with everything that isneeded.andP;  By its hubristic decision to let 100 flowers bloom on a single day,IBM brought that eventuality a giant leap closer.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
