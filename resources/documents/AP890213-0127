The plan, announced last week, would provide $90 billion to closeor sell 350 insolvent Sandamp;Ls and meet pledges made by regulators lastyear in cleaning up 223 institutions.   The Shadow Financial Regulatory Committee, a group of 12financial experts from colleges and consulting and law firms,praised Bush for recognizing that the Sandamp;L problem is much morecostly than previously acknowledged by the government.   But, in a statement, it said, ``There is a strong possibilitythat additional thrifts which are now marginally solvent will becomeinsolvent in the near future. Increases in interest rates may alsolead to financial difficulties for many more thrift institutions.''   Meanwhile, in a separate development, the Federal DepositInsurance Corp. on Monday took control of Midwest Federal Savings andamp;Loan Association, an insolvent Sandamp;L in Minneapolis.   Midwest was the 11th institution taken over under a programannounced by Bush last week. The FDIC plans to assume control ofmore than 200 Sandamp;Ls, insolvent under regulatory accounting rules,over the next four to six weeks.   Although government regulators will be more strictly supervisingthe institutions, the FDIC is emphasizing that all insured depositswill continue to be fully protected.   Arizona State University business professor Edward J. Kane, amember of the shadow regulatory committee, estimated that 800 to 850institutions of the nation's 3,000 thrifts are ``economicallyinsolvent'' even though regulatory accounting rules show a farsmaller number.   ``Any increase in interest rates is ... going to put a lot (more)institutions under water,'' said Franklin Edwards, a businessprofessor at Columbia University.   The group did not offer its own figure to counter theadministration's $90 billion estimate, but Edwards said the red inkcould total as much as $130 billion.   Edwards said Bush would be wise politically to deal with the fullproblem now, early in his term. He also criticized the proposal toraise $50 billion over the next three years by selling``off-budget'' bonds. The interest costs would be less expensive ifthe money were raised by borrowing directly through the Treasury, hesaid.   Bush's plan also reorganizes the regulatory structure by givingthe Treasury Department and the commercial bank insurance fund, theFDIC, more authority over savings and loans.   But, Kenneth E. Scott of the Stanford University School of Lawsaid the president's plan seem more aimed at ``moving boxes'' thanaccomplishing real reforms.   The committee advocated a program of early intervention thatwould impose federal control when an institution weakened and forcethe institution to shut down before it actually became insolvent.That way, depositors would be protected and expenditures by thefederal insurance funds would be rare.</TEXT></DOC>
