Jim Leach, a Bush supporter.    Both men in this key gateway state are talking about Mr. Bush's unhesitating support of President Reagan and his treaty with the Soviet Union to eliminate medium-range nuclear missiles in Europe -- and Sen. Bob Dole's refusal to engage in what he calls &quot;premature cheerleading&quot; by taking a stand before the treaty is &quot;signed, sealed and delivered.&quot;    &quot;Dole looks like a straddler,&quot; says Mr. Leach, who predicts, perhaps exuberantly, that it is the kind of development that could decide the battle for the Republican presidential nomination.    Dole strategists, belatedly, seem to be recognizing the urgency of the situation. They met yesterday in Washington to review their position. &quot;It surprised people in the campaign just how intense the reaction was to Dole's position,&quot; says one of the senator's top campaign advisers.    But Mr. Dole isn't budging. In a speech to a group of newspaper executives yesterday, he called for a cooling of &quot;glasnost fever&quot; and said the proposed treaty puts strains on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization alliance. He cautioned against early acceptance. &quot;Let's withhold final judgment until we see what we have,&quot; he said.    The Dole strategists indicate Mr. Dole probably will endorse the treaty in the next week, after which they will begin to portray their candidate as the only contender with a vote on the treaty. That gets them back to their main argument -- that Mr. Dole is a hands-on politician, working in the trenches, while the vice president is something of a political dilettante, a man with a resume but not a record.    The rest of the Republican pack -- Rep. Jack Kemp of New York, former Gov. Pete du Pont of Delaware, retired Gen. Alexander Haig and TV evangelist Pat Robertson -- can't be accused of straddling. They all oppose the treaty. They take this stand partly out of conviction, partly because of Republican demographics. Many GOP activists -- the people who will go to the caucuses and vote in the primaries -- are rigidly conservative and tend to form the minority that opposes agreements with the Soviet Union.    Mr. Kemp, at a luncheon yesterday with Wall Street Journal reporters and editors, said it's too early to calculate political fallout. Referring to surveys that show public support of the treaty, he added, &quot;I'm not so sure the polls are going to come out the same way at the end of the (ratification) process as they are at the beginning.&quot;    He was asked about Sen. Dole's position. &quot;What is it?&quot; he responded.    Why the events of the past few days may be so important to Mr. Dole and Mr. Bush, the front-runners in the GOP race, is that Mr. Dole's performance tends to refute his own argument. The vice president is the candidate taking a stand; Mr. Dole is the wily legislator constantly in search of a compromise, a man who can't seem to make up his mind.    The changing perception of the two is especially important in Iowa, the traditional opening round in the heavyweight presidential championship. Iowa voters caucus to pick delegates on Feb. 8. A recent NBC poll shows 77% of Iowa Republicans support the treaty and only 12% oppose it. The same poll shows Sen. Dole running 16 points ahead of the vice president among Republicans likely to attend the caucuses.    &quot;My problem in Iowa,&quot; Mr. Bush concedes, is that &quot;standing loyally with the president is not the asset it is in other places.&quot; But, on this issue, Mr. Bush and not Mr. Dole is standing in the same place as the overwhelming majority of Iowa's Republican voters.    Even if Sen. Dole does come around to support the treaty, and to help to lead the fight in the Senate to ratify it, Bush strategists think the voters will remember his reluctance to stand up for it early on.    Last week, campaigning in rural Iowa, Mr. Bush's central theme in all his campaign stops was his support of his president and the treaty. He called on senators to back the agreement, so Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, who arrived in Washington yesterday, wouldn't be under any misapprehension.    &quot;I'm appalled at some of the criticism of the president,&quot; Mr. Bush told supporters here in Grundy Center. &quot;Why some senators can't say, 'I support this treaty in principle,' I don't know.&quot; But at the same time Mr. Bush quietly indicated he, too, might be interested in amendments and reservations in the treaty.    &quot;Set aside politics for a week or so,&quot; the vice president told another group in the Old Creamery Theater in Garrison, &quot;and get behind the treaty.&quot;    Never once, though, did Mr. Bush specifically call on Mr. Dole, his party's Senate leader, to rally around the treaty at least in principle, a bold action endorsed by some of his own advisers.    Why not take Mr. Dole on? he was asked on Air Force Two.    &quot;I just don't want to seem partisan this week,&quot; he replied. </TEXT></DOC>
