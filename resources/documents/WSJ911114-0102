His remarks runcounter to those of several other oil ministers who cautionthat OPEC may face the risk of an oil glut and crumblingprices if it continues to produce flat out as demand beginsto slacken seasonally after the end of winter.   Mr. Armas was here to address the InterAmerican Petroleumand Gas Conference. He told the group of North and SouthAmerican oil executives and government officials that he hadjust received word from a meeting of the OPEC economiccommission board in Vienna that demand for OPEC oil is nowforecast &quot;on the order of 24 plus&quot; million barrels a day forthe 1992 first quarter.   That suggests oil-consuming nations will have to draw downon oil inventories to meet all their winter needs, Mr. Armassaid. &quot;I don't feel OPEC can go much beyond 24 millionbarrels a day,&quot; he said.   Mr. Armas estimated OPEC's current production is nearcapacity at 23.7 million barrels a day, slightly under otherindustry estimates of current output. As a result, he said,there isn't any need to discuss output quotas -- abandonedafter the Persian Gulf crisis began in August 1990 -- at theregular winter conference of the ministers beginning Nov. 26in Vienna, where OPEC is headquartered.   Asked when the time will be appropriate for OPEC todiscuss quotas again, Mr. Armas replied: &quot;It depends on thelevel of demand and the situation on exports from Kuwait andIraq.&quot; But so far, he said, the oil supply-demand situationhas changed little since the Persian Gulf crisis began.   Mr. Armas described the weakness in oil markets in thepast few days as &quot;a little blip on prices.&quot; The average ofthe OPEC basket of seven crudes has dropped to around $20 abarrel after having recently approached OPEC's $21 target.   Still, Mr. Armas said, the world is entering the high oildemand period of winter. As a result, he said he doesn'texpect the November OPEC conference to be &quot;a dramaticmeeting.&quot; He added: &quot;The fundamentals are in favor of a quickagreement for the first quarter.&quot; He said the outlook for thesecond quarter likely won't be discussed until the ministersmeet again next March.   Several other oil ministers -- including those fromAlgeria, Nigeria, Indonesia and Iran -- are likely to pressstrongly for a possible return to production quotas in thefirst quarter, however. At a London energy conference thisweek, Nordine Ait Laoussine, the Algerian minister, summed uptheir view by saying OPEC needed at least to discuss theissue of quotas now if it's going to be ready to head off aperiod of price weakness when the war-damaged countries ofIraq and Kuwait resume significant exports of oil. The ideais for the others to make room for the Iraqi and Kuwaiti oilby cutting their own production. &quot;The need to cut isinevitable,&quot; he said.   Concern was also voiced here by the oil minister ofanother OPEC member who joined Mr. Armas and other energyministers from Latin America in addressing the InterAmericanconference. In an interview, Oscar Garzon, the new oilminister for Ecuador, said he expects oil prices will remainaround current levels for the remainder of this quarter. Butif OPEC should raise production any further, &quot;what's going tohappen to oil prices in the first quarter of next year?&quot; heasked.   Carlos Saul Menem, the president of Argentina, also spokeat the conference before going on to Washington. Theconference goal is to evaluate opportunities for investmentsbetween the U.S. and Latin America.</TEXT></DOC>
