The 1980s were the salad days for bizspeak, buzzwords and lousymetaphors.   Business people tried to stay ahead of the curve by shootingfrom the lip with just the right jargon to show they were players,not bean counters.   To say it in the '80s, you had to coin it _ or so it seemed fromthe flood of new and retreaded idioms unleashed during the MoneyDecade.   Below are some of the serious and not-so-serious entries fromthe decade's business lexicon:   ARBITRAGE: Wall Street's high-stakes game of ``buying low andselling high'' simultaneously. A variation of the strategy was usedby the decade's most notorious ``arb,'' Ivan Boesky, to speculatein takeover stocks. The word at first sent business writersscurrying for dictionaries, but by decade's end arbitrage wassynonymous with wheeling and dealing.   BAILOUT: A government rescue. Corporations averted a crashlanding by parachuting into Uncle Sam's warm embrace, among themChrysler Corp., Continental Bank and many savings and loans.   BEAN COUNTER: Pejoratively, a back-office type, often fromaccounting, disparaged for watching the bottom line. Some say theygained inordinate power in the '80s.   BUNDLING: Packaging debt _ from leveraged buyouts to mortgages _in nice tidy bundles for sale to investors.

Sample: ``Euro-pessimism (or Euro-sclerosis) isbecoming Euro-phoria as 12 Western European countries prepare tounite in one trading community.''   GLOBALIZATION: The new world where corporate power transcendsnational boundaries and the United States is not the only economicsuperpower.   GOLDEN: As in parachute, umbrella or handcuffs. It describes alucrative goodbye handed to corporate executives.   GREATER FOOL THEORY: An explanation for why stocks rise.Investors overpay on the assumption they will be able to unload onsomeone else at an even dearer price.   GREENMAIL: Refers to the color of the payoff raiders get forquitting the hunt. It is more than average shareholders can get,thus the echo of blackmail.   INSIDER TRADER: Boesky is alleged to have been one, along withdozens of others caught up in the government's crackdown onsecurities fraud in the '80s. They are so described for tradingstock on the basis of secret information that gives them an unfairadvantage.   JAPANESE: America's chief economic rival; synonymous withquality, efficiency, reliability; also, fear, loathing and power.

PRIVATIZATION: The sale of nationally owned companies toinvestors, as with Japan's phone company and several Britishindustries.

The latter caused the term to become arallying cry of Reagan critics.   RESTRUCTURING, DOWNSIZING: Euphemisms for cost-cutting, layingoff workers and attaining more profits with fewer employees.   SHARK: Any of a variety of predators notorious for theirvoracious appetite for takeovers and unfriendly assaults oninnocent companies.
