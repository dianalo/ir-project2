The statute defines ``investment securities'' tomean marketable obligations evidencing indebtedness of any person, partnership,association, or corporation in the form of bonds, notes, and debentures.The Act further limits the holdings of securities of any one issuer toan amount equal to ten percent of the capital stock and surplus of thebank. These limits, however, do not apply to obligations issued by theUnited States, general obligations of any state or any political subdivisionof any state, and to certain obligations of federal agencies. The restrictionsof 12 U.S.C. 24(7) also apply to state member banks under (12 U.S.C. 335.(c) <T3>Authorization. </T3>The Board has determined that a state member bankmay purchase and hold for its own account stock of any investment company(including a money market mutual fund), subject to the following conditions:(1) <T3>Investment authority of the investment company. </T3>The investmentcompany may have authority, as stated in the investment objectives of itscurrent prospectus, to invest in the following securities and no others:United States Treasury and agency obligations, general obligations of statesand municipalities, corporate debt securities, and any other securitiesdesignated in 12 U.S.C. 24(7) as eligible for purchase by national banksthat state member banks are authorized to purchase directly. The investmentcompany may have authority, as stated in the investment objectives of itscurrent prospectus, to enter into futures, forwards and option contractsrelating to the above securities when those futures, forwards and optioncontracts are to be used solely to reduce interest rate risk and not forspeculation. The investment company may also have authority, as statedin the investment objectives of its current prospectus, to enter into repurchaseagreements and securities lending contracts relating to the securitiesdesignated above if those contracts comply with policy statements adoptedby the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council. <T3>See </T3>45 F.R. 18,120 (March 20, 1980) and Fed. Res. Reg. Svc. andpara;andpara;3-1535, 3-1579.1, and 3-1579.5. (2) <T3>Limits on investment. </T3>(i) If the portfolio of the investment companyin which a state member bank may invest consists solely of obligationsthat the bank could purchase without restriction as to amount, or solelyof those obligations and futures, forwards, options, repurchase agreementsand securities lending contracts relating solely to those obligations,no express limit is placed on investment. (ii) If the portfolio of the investment company in which a state memberbank may invest included any securities that the bank could purchase subjectto a restriction as to amount, the pro-rata share of holdings of such securitiesof an issuer indirectly held by a state member bank through its holdingsof investment company stock (including money market mutual funds), whenaggregated with the direct investment in securities of that issuer by thebank, must not exceed the investment limit. (3) <T3>Registration of publicly offered investment company stock. </T3>Exceptas provided in section (c)(4), investment company stock purchased by astate member bank must be of an investment company registered with theSecurities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Company Act of1940 and the Securities Act of 1933. (4) <T3>Privately offered fund. </T3>The stock purchased may be of a privatelyoffered fund if the sponsor of the fund is a subsidiary of a bank holdingcompany, and if the stock of the fund is held solely by subsidiaries ofthe bank holding company. (5) <T3>Proportionate and undivided interest. </T3>The stock purchased mustrepresent an equitable, equal, and proportionate undivided interest inthe underlying assets of the investment company. (6) <T3>Stockholders shielded from liability. </T3>The stockholders must beshielded from personal liability for acts and obligations of the investmentcompany.(7) <T3>Bank investment policy and procedures.</T3> (i) The investment policyof the bank, as formally approved by its board of directors, must specificallyprovide for investment in investment company stock. The investment policymust establish procedures, standards, and controls that relate specificallyto investments in investment company stock. (ii) Prior approval of the board of directors of the bank must be obtainedfor investment in a specific investment company and recorded in the officialboard minutes. (iii) Unless the investment objectives of the investment companies, asstated in their current prospectuses, restrict investments to those obligationsthat the state member bank could purchase without restriction as to amount,the bank must review its holdings of investment company stock at leastquarterly to ensure that investments have been made in accordance withestablished bank policies and legal requirements. (8) <T3>Reporting and accounting. </T3>Reporting of holdings of investmentcompany stock must be consistent with established standards for ``marketableequity securities.'' Accordingly, the instructions for the quarterly Reportsof Condition and Income and the requirements of the Financial AccountingStandards Board Statement No. 12 must be followed. (i) Holdings of investment campany stock must be reported as ``All other''securities on Schedule RC-B, Item 4(b) on the quarterly Reports of Condition,unless otherwise directed.(ii) In no case may the carrying value of investment stock be increasedabove aggregate cost as a result of net unrealized gains.
