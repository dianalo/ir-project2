Securities laws require banks and brokerage firms thathold other types of securities for their customers to deliverproxy materials to shareholders. But a regulatory loopholeexcluded mutual fund shares held in nominee accounts fromthat rule.</LP><TEXT>   SEC officials said the National Association of SecuritiesDealers requires most brokerage firms to send all proxymaterials, including those involving mutual funds, to theircustomers. But banks, which also hold securities on behalf oftheir customers, aren't subject to those rules, agencyofficials said.   The SEC doesn't know how many banks failed to deliverproxies to mutual fund shareholders, but several fundssurveyed by the agency a few years ago said they found &quot;apattern of shares being held in nominee name not beingvoted,&quot; said Robert Plaze, assistant director of the SEC'sinvestment management division.   In recent years, mutual funds often have been unable toobtain a quorum for proxy votes, Mr. Plaze said. Under SECrules, a fund that can't obtain a quorum for a vote mustconduct another proxy solicitation, which can be expensive.Mutual funds agreed to support the rule change &quot;because itwould help them reach a quorum,&quot; Mr. Plaze said.   At the SEC's request, Congress adopted legislation lastyear giving the SEC authority to require banks and brokeragefirms to deliver proxy materials to mutual fund shareholderswho hold shares in nominee accounts. The change will apply tothe coming proxy season, SEC officials said.   SEC officials said many banks already have taken steps toimprove proxy delivery for mutual fund shareholders, so theydon't expect any sharp changes as a result of the new rule.</TEXT></DOC>
