(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   All regions of California will postpopulation gains of more than 20 percent by the year 2000 andSacramento will be the fastest growing area, according to a newstudy.   The study released on Tuesday by the Center for Continuing Studyof the California Economy said the state's population will addnearly 6 million people in the next decade to reach 35 million by2000.   San Diego will be the state's second fastest growing regionwhile the Los Angeles Basin will add nearly 3 million residents.The San Francisco Bay area will grow by around a million.   The forecast was higher than those by most state and regionalagencies. The study by the center projected a statewide populationmore than 2 million higher than the state Department of Finance.   ``Slow growth is not realistic,'' said Stephen Levy, thecenter's director. ``The choices are either planned growth orunplanned growth so we need to stop wishing and start preparing.''   The study said foreign immigration plays a key role in thestate's growth with nearly 1 in 2 new residents a recent immigrant.The center predicted the trend will continue with the addition ofmore than 250,000 foreign immigrants each year.   ``In 1988 ethnic minorities accounted for 40 percent of thestate's residents,'' the study said. ``By 2000 the share will benearly 50 percent.''   The demographics underlying the housing market should remainstrong, the forecast added.   ``Household growth is projected to range from 190,000 to 275,000a year, depending on income growth and the behavior of recentimmigrants. Much of the growth wil be in the 35-54 age group whichhas the highest income levels.''</TEXT></DOC>
