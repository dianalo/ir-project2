Alternative formsof abandonment and the engineering and financial factors involved arediscussed. Both steel-piled and concrete-gravity platforms are consideredand the influence that their inherently different natures has on thechoice of abandonment policy. This policy may range from leaving theplatforms in place through various stages of partial removal to completeremoval to seabed level. The UK government has not formed a final viewon what its requirement will be but it seems likely that a flexible approachwill be adopted taking into account different water depths, locationsand types of platform. Decisions are likely in the next few years tomeet the expected start of abandonment in the early 1990's.</TEXT></DOC>
