Mounting war scares drove futures prices of crude inLondon and New York beyond $30 a barrel -- the highest levelfor the North Sea Brent and the U.S. West Texas Intermediatesince 1985. Some oil prices reached as high as $40 a barrelin the early 1980s.</LP><TEXT>   On London's International Petroleum Exchange, Brent crudefor October delivery broke through the psychologicallyimportant level only moments before the close and thensettled $2.56 a barrel higher at $30.19. In the U.S. futuresmarket, October crude traded above $30 by early afternoon andended at $31.22 a barrel, up $2.51.   Fuel prices also leaped in frantic futures trading. On theNew York Mercantile Exchange, September heating oil jumped7.64 cents to pass 91 cents a gallon. Motor fuel wasn't farbehind. Unleaded gasoline for September delivery rose 2.85cents to $1.04 a gallon.   The petroleum-price surge helped drive down stock and bondprices in U.S. markets.   Growing Middle East tensions contributed to bothdevelopments, with the oil-price climb being accelerated bynews that Saudi Arabia's exports of refined products may bedrying up because the fuels are needed by military forceswithin its borders.   Before European and U.S. markets opened, Japanesecustomers of Saudi Arabia reported they had been notifiedthat deliveries of so-called middle distillates, whichinclude fuels such as kerosene and diesel oil, will besuspended for September. That led to the run-up in Europeanand U.S. markets in prices of heating oil, which is closelyrelated to diesel fuel and other middle distillates.   Oil industry officials confirmed that supplies of somepetroleum products are beginning to tighten in some areas ofthe world, particularly in such countries as Pakistan, whichformerly depended on fuels from the now-closed refineries ofKuwait. This is due in part to the fact that the U.S.military is seeking additional jet and diesel fuels in thePersian Gulf region. Also, some oil-producing countries arebeginning to stockpile some of the fuels their refineriesproduce in case of eventual domestic needs.   Overall, Saudi Arabia's reduction in product exports isn'texpected to have a big world-wide impact, however. Saudi oilofficials said that the cuts probably will be limited andthat crude-oil exports aren't affected.   The kingdom's main petroleum exports are crude oil, notfuels. Also, industry officials said that even though theremay be some dislocation of destinations for some Saudipetroleum products, the overall volumes of fuels to beprocessed remain the same.   There were new indications, meanwhile, that Saudi Arabia'stotal exports will be increased in the next few days in linewith its prior commitment to produce more to help offset thelosses to world markets of four million barrels a day ofIraqi and Kuwaiti crudes.   &quot;What the markets may be ignoring is that the Saudis havefollowed through&quot; on their plan to sell more crude to theircustomers, said Marshall Thomas, editor in chief of the OilDaily. Mr. Thomas, an oil-marketing expert, said that in thepast few days the Saudis have responded to customer requestsfor more oil. &quot;This oil can be available starting in four orfive days,&quot; he said.   Hisham Nazer, the Saudi oil minister, officially confirmedlast Saturday that the kingdom would produce as much as twomillion barrels a day more than its OPEC quota to helpstabilize oil markets. Such a step would be taken with orwithout the approval of the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries, Mr. Nazer said.   Venezuela also is understood to be increasing itsproduction now after waffling over whether it would actwithout OPEC's approval in providing as much as a promised500,000 barrels a day in additional oil to world supplies.But both Venezuela and Saudi Arabia still hope for someendorsement of their plans from others in OPEC.   Yesterday, some OPEC sources suggested that the oilministers of at least six countries -- Saudi Arabia,Venezuela, Algeria, Indonesia, Iran and Nigeria -- might meetas soon as Sunday to consider the oil supply situation.   Sadek Boussena, Algeria's oil minister and president ofOPEC, is understood to be sending letters to each of theothers suggesting the meeting. But late yesterday an officialof the Saudi petroleum ministry said such a letter hadn't yetbeen received.   In Caracas, Celestino Armas, Venezuela's oil minister,told reporters that OPEC &quot;will possibly hold a consultationmeeting&quot; in Vienna on Sunday to discuss a temporaryre-distribution of oil quotas. He said such a meeting wouldbe attended by &quot;all 13 members&quot; but didn't clarify howKuwait, currently occupied by Iraq, would be represented.</TEXT></DOC>
