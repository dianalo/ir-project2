If deposits from drug dealers wereproffered, the bank only asked: How much? If it was moneyfrom Manuel Noriega, BCCI opened its doors.   To keep a respectable face, the bank hired Washingtoninsiders, such as Clark Clifford, the former defensesecretary, and cozied up to former president Jimmy Carter andother political figures. Amid all this, it grew --astoundingly. From seemingly nowhere, BCCI rocketed to $21billion in assets spread over an empire of 400 branches in 73countries, making it one of the world's 20 biggest privatelyheld banks. It kept its headquarters in Luxembourg, kept itsmain offices in London, kept its ownership obscured by CaymanIslands trusts -- and kept its regulators always off balance.</LP><TEXT>   But the fast life is catching up to BCCI. Earlier thisyear, in a much publicized case, BCCI pleaded guilty torunning the biggest single-bank drug-money launderingoperation in U.S. history. Now, this week, BCCI announcedanother shock: It had a loss of $498 million in 1989, largelybecause of a charge for bad loans. It also said thegovernment of Abu Dhabi had injected $400 million into thebank to help it meet international loan standards, increasingAbu Dhabi's stake in BCCI to 77%. People familiar with thebank's operations say BCCI is also planning sweepingorganizational changes.   The convulsions at BCCI are the latest chapter in ashadowy history that ultimately created the world's biggestrogue bank. &quot;This bank is offshore at all points,&quot; grumblesone U.S. state investigator, who, along with House, Senate,Justice and Treasury Department officials is trying to piecetogether BCCI's U.S. connections.   Of greatest interest is how BCCI surfed on the edge of oneof the big financial waves of the 1980s: The hot moneygenerated by the cocaine industry. According to Michael L.Rubinstein, a federal prosecutor in the money-launderingcase, BCCI has been guided by a policy that &quot;came down fromthe highest levels of the bank: to take in as many depositsas you can, as fast as you can, and not to be too carefulabout where they came from.&quot; BCCI's representatives declinedto be interviewed for this article. But, in the wake of itsguilty plea in January, BCCI said the bank had been &quot;misusedby unscrupulous elements&quot; and that it was retraining itsemployees.   The bank got out of the laundering case with a $15 millionfine -- a small rap on the knuckles, given BCCI's size.What's more, three of the bank's six branches in the U.S.,located in California and New York, were allowed to continueoperating.   Clark Clifford and his protege Robert Altman are theprimary figures behind the legal clout the bank wields in theU.S. The two men even picked the attorneys who are nowrepresenting nine former BCCI officials charged in themoney-laundering case in which the bank pleaded guilty.Messrs. Clifford and Altman, however, have an interest inBCCI that goes beyond legal representation: The two are alsothe Washington managers for the people who own First AmericanBankshares Inc., an $11.5 billion bank holding company inwhich BCCI's principals have an overlapping ownership.   BCCI's twisting trail has even turned up amid the wreckageof the U.S. thrift industry. Treasury and Justice Departmentinvestigators probing the ruins of scandal-plagued CenTrustBank of Miami suspect that BCCI secretly &quot;parked&quot; $25 millionin CenTrust in 1988 to help keep the sick thriftinstitution's books looking healthy. CenTrust went intoreceivership in March, and is expected eventually to costU.S. taxpayers about $2 billion. But before CenTrust failed,BCCI got all of its money back -- at a time when theinstitution was paying other creditors 67 cents on thedollar. BCCI insists its investment in CenTrust -- in theform of a debt purchase -- was legal and wasn't part of any&quot;parking&quot; scheme, under which the size of CenTrust's debtcould be concealed. Nonetheless, the deal is beinginvestigated by the Justice Department. A lawyer for DavidPaul, the former head of CenTrust, says his client denies anywrongdoing.   The story of BCCI's staggering growth, knack for survivaland keen nose for cash begins decades ago in Allahabad,India. In 1947, when India won its independence, Agha HasanAbedi was one of thousands of Shiite Muslims trekking fromIndia to the new nation of Pakistan. After he arrived, Mr.Abedi, a cultured man, started the United Bank of Pakistanalong with several other immigrants, including Swaleh Naqvi,who became his deputy.   In 1973 the Pakistani government nationalized United, butMr. Abedi was prepared. He had ingratiated himself with therulers of the United Arab Emirates, where oil had just beendiscovered. Mr. Abedi had spent years courting the U.A.E.'sprincelings studying in Pakistan. He was there to take themand their falcons out in air-conditioned jeeps to hunt forthe slowflying bustard. And he proffered financial advice totheir fathers, some of whom kept stacks of cash in theirbasements.   U.S. banks, including Bank of America, theCalifornia-based giant, also sensed opportunity in theregion. But they found they couldn't gain entree to theUnited Arab Emirates, Qatar, Oman and Kuwait without goingthrough the well-connected Mr. Abedi. So in 1972 Bank ofAmerica stole a march on its rivals and put up $2.5 millionfor a 25% stake in a new bank to be called Bank of Credit andCommerce International. It would be run by Mr. Abedi.   Bank of America now declines to comment on its role increating BCCI. But former Bank of America executives say itsconsiderable prestige was crucial to BCCI's early growth.&quot;During the early years he (Mr. Abedi) benefited a great dealfrom his association with Bank of America,&quot; says Alvin C.Rice, who oversaw the American bank's investment in BCCI.   From the start, according to testimony by Yves LaMarche,Bank of America's former director of Middle East operations,Mr. Abedi wanted BCCI &quot;to become the biggest bank in theworld.&quot; Mr. Abedi combined that ambition with a mysticalmanagement style. At an in-house gathering, he encouragedemployees to pursue &quot;the all-encompassing cosmic wisdom&quot;through &quot;humility, love and total submission to God.&quot;   The deposit-hungry bank targeted what it termed &quot;HNWs&quot; --people with &quot;high net worths.&quot; Spreading from its base in thePersian Gulf, it opened 45 branches in England. Some of thoseserved Pakistani and Indian immigrants. But the big money inLondon came from BCCI's &quot;Middle Eastern Mobilisation Unit,&quot;which catered to the whims of visiting oil sheiks.   Bank of America soon began to feel uneasy about itshigh-flying partner. Oil prices quadrupled in the years afterBCCI's founding, but BCCI's asset growth far outstripped thatpace. That bothered Bank of America officials who couldn'tfind records explaining where the growth was coming from.Poorly documented loans also scared them: &quot;If you were lucky,you'd see a memo that said something like, `Obviously thesheik is good for a million dollars,'&quot; recalls Mr. Rice. Mr.Rice, who would rise to vice chairman of Bank of Americabefore leaving in 1978, says Mr. Abedi repeatedly promisedbetter controls, but failed to implement them. Mr. Abedi, whorecently received a heart transplant, is an invalid andwasn't available for comment for this article.   Eventually, says Mr. Rice, Bank of America quietly beganto back away from BCCI, beginning with a request in 1976 thatthe bank remove Bank of America's logo from its letterhead.   At that point Mr. Abedi began making another U.S.connection. Like much of BCCI's activities, some of the factsare disputed, and much of the story is murky. But thisportion of the BCCI saga appears to have begun with R. EugeneHolley, the former Georgia state senator who is remembered asthe first person ever charged under the Foreign CorruptPractices Act. He agreed not to contest the charges, whichstemmed from bribes he allegedly made to an official inQatar. Mr. Holley, who declined to be interviewed, knew Mr.Abedi from a deal he had made to refinance an oil-drillingconcession in Qatar.   Bert Lance, who resigned from the Carter Administration in1977, says that Mr. Holley brought Mr. Abedi to the U.S.,where Mr. Abedi was interested in establishing a banking&quot;presence.&quot; Mr. Lance sold his own institution, National Bankof Georgia, to Ghaith Pharaon, a sometime shareholder in BCCIand a longtime business ally of Mr. Abedi, in a deal arrangedby Mr. Abedi and financed with a bridge loan from BCCI.   Meanwhile, Mr. Lance acted as BCCI's agent in the takeoverof the Washington-based bank holding company then known asFinancial General Bankshares. On Feb. 17, 1978, according tocourt records in Washington, he informed Financial Generalthat BCCI held 20% of its stock, and wanted more.   In separate actions, Financial General and the Securitiesand Exchange Commission sued Mr. Abedi, BCCI, several Arabinvestors and Mr. Lance for failing to make the requireddisclosure that they were acting in concert. Mr. Lance thenintroduced the BCCI men to Messrs. Clifford and Altman. Theensuing 3 1/2-year court battle eventually boiled down to therelationship between BCCI and four Middle Easterners who eachhad purchased just under 5% of Financial General's stock, thethreshold beyond which ownership must be disclosed. Indepositions, they revealed an array of ties to BCCI as bothborrowers and shareholders. Indeed, one turned out to be thechairman of Kuwait International Finance Co., BCCI's branchin Kuwait.   But in 1981 Mr. Clifford managed to convince the FederalReserve Board, which had to approve the bank acquisition,that those ties were unimportant. &quot;I think it is a group ofindividuals operating as individuals,&quot; he said at the time.One of the Arab investors, he said, told BCCI about the deal,and it brought in three other unrelated bank clients.   The SEC suit ended in a consent agreement under which thedefendants neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing, and agreedto obey securities laws in the future. Financial General'ssuit was eventually dropped.   With the conflict resolved, Mr. Clifford's relationshipwith the bankers grew: He became chairman of FinancialGeneral, now named First American Bankshares Inc., and Mr.Altman became its president.   Officially, First American is controlled by a company inthe Netherlands Antilles called Credit and Commerce AmericanHoldings N.V. Mr. Clifford declines to say to what extentBCCI shareholders own shares in his bank, saying that &quot;Mostpeople of means like to keep their business private.&quot; But areview of regulatory filings and several interviews in theU.S., France, England, and the Middle East indicate that thedegree of overlap is considerable, and that the rulingfamilies of Abu Dhabi and Dubai -- two of the United ArabEmirates -- have a dominating presence in both banks. Also,former Saudi intelligence chief Kamal Adham is a keyshareholder in both.   Moreover, in 1986 the owners of Mr. Clifford's bankdecided to expand by buying Mr. Lance's old bank in Georgiafrom Mr. Pharaon, the old BCCI ally. Four former employees orassociates of BCCI already were working there. Theacquisition, made for $220 million in cash, gave FirstAmerican a network that now extends from Florida to upstateNew York.   The early '80s were busy years for BCCI. Mr. Abedicultivated important political figures around the globe. Inthe U.S. he concentrated on Jimmy Carter. He donated $500,000to the former president's library in Atlanta and later gave$2.5 million to Global 2000, a program launched by Mr. Carterto help eradicate disease and promote better farming in theThird World. Mr. Carter has used BCCI's Boeing 727 jet on atleast four international trips over the last five years. Hisjoint appearances with Mr. Abedi in such places as China,Thailand and the Soviet Union have been regularly featured inBCCI's in-house magazine. Through a spokesman, Mr. Carterdeclines to comment.   In London, meanwhile, BCCI lost $150 million speculatingin U.S. government bond options. Shaken by the experience, itlaunched a bankwide drive to gather new deposits.   In its push, it aggressively pursued one of thefastest-growing sources of dollars in the 1980s: drugprofits. It purchased a Colombian bank with 30 branches,including five in Medellin, home of the largest, mostnotorious cocaine cartel.   It also ran into a U.S. Customs Service sting operation.Amjad Awan, an officer with BCCI's Latin America divisionbased in Miami, became the main target of the sting, whichtook some $32 million from various operatives of the Medellincartel and ran almost half of it through BCCI.   Robert Mazur, an undercover Customs agent who depositedthe cartel's funds, says various BCCI officers warned him hewas doing it all wrong, and would likely be nabbed byAmerican authorities. In testimony in federal court in Tampa,he said Syed Aftab Hussain, a BCCI officer in Panama, advisedhim not to use checks, but instead to employ an untraceable&quot;counterbalancing loan scheme.&quot; Mr. Mazur has testified, forexample, that, under the scheme, $476,595 he placed with anunidentified BCCI office was wired through a correspondentaccount in First American Bank in Washington to the BCCIbranch in Geneva, Switzerland. Then he received what appearedto be an unrelated loan for the same amount, minus a smallfee, from BCCI's Panama branch.   Mr. Mazur testified that he told the BCCI banker that hiscash was cocaine money. Mr. Mazur added that Mr. Hussainreplied, &quot;Well, in that case, perhaps you would want to putthe funds in Luxembourg&quot; to hide them better. Wearing hishidden tape recorder, Mr. Mazur also talked about cocaineprofits with BCCI officers in London, Geneva, Paris and LosAngeles.   Attorneys for Mr. Hussain and other BCCI officialscurrently being tried in Tampa for money laundering say theywere merely following BCCI's aggressive policies to bring indeposits, and weren't involved in money laundering.   The bank tells a different story. When it pleaded guiltyto money laundering in January, it admitted to knowinglydealing with two major U.S. drug dealers. One, StephenKalish, later confessed he was grossing $60 million a year,and that when he was caught he was making financialarrangements through BCCI to import one million pounds ofmarijuana.   By October 1988, Mr. Mazur was such a treasured client ofBCCI that a dozen bank officers he had dealt with, includingMr. Awan and several from Europe, flew to Tampa to attendwhat was billed as his wedding. The limousines that met themat the airport, however, whisked them not to a bachelor partybut to the federal courthouse, where most of them werebooked.   Meanwhile, a Senate Foreign Affairs subcommittee had begunpoking around Manuel Noriega's finances, and in the course ofthat ran into BCCI. Among other things, it subpoenaed Mr.Awan to talk with him about Mr. Noriega's client relationshipwith the bank. (Mr. Rubinstein, a prosecutor in the Tampacase, has asserted in federal court that in August 1988,Messrs. Clifford and Altman advised Mr. Awan to dodge theSenate subpoena by having BCCI transfer him out of thecountry. Both lawyers deny giving such advice, and Mr. Awanstayed in the U.S.)   Mr. Clifford, in his capacity as BCCI's lawyer, told Sen.John Kerry, chairman of the subcommittee, that he wasn'taware of any BCCI documents concerning Mr. Noriega that werein the U.S. subject to the subpoena. BCCI documents laterseized by British customs show that at least $600,000 of Mr.Noriega's money flowed from Panama first to BCCI accounts ina Washington branch of First American, Mr. Clifford's bank,and then to Europe. In a letter sent last week to Mr.Clifford, Sen. Kerry contended that at least the documentsregarding those accounts &quot;should have been produced&quot; by Mr.Clifford under the earlier subpoena.   Mr. Altman says that a check of First American customeraccounts shows no indication of Mr. Noriega's money.Identifying documents, he says, might have been in a BCCIinternal file, &quot;but not anything that First American had.&quot;   Sen. Kerry isn't convinced. &quot;I think there's a regulatoryfailure here,&quot; he says, referring to the links between BCCIand First American. He says he will ask the Senate BankingCommittee, which he recently joined, to look into the matter.   Since he is still recuperating from his heart transplant,Mr. Abedi has handed over operation of BCCI to Mr. Naqvi, hislongtime deputy, who, spokesmen say, has instituted the majorretraining program for bank employees. In a recent openletter to them he vowed that &quot;never again shall we allow ourbank's good name to be smeared and tarnished by carelessnessor negligence or lack of vigilance.&quot;   Left holding the bag for BCCI's U.S. misadventures are itsformer employees now on trial in Tampa. As part of its pleaagreement, BCCI fired them. BCCI, however, continues to payfor their legal representation.   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          CLARK CLIFFORD AND ROBERT ALTMAN were incorrectlyidentified in artwork accompanying a page one articleyesterday on Bank of Credit and Commerce International.
