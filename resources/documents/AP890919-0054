(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two anti-gun organizations soughtgrassroots support for stricter gun laws as the death toll from ashooting rampage at a printing plant rose to nine.   Kenneth Fentress, 45, died Monday afternoon, said a spokeswomanat Humana Hospital University. Fentress suffered gunshot wounds tothe chest and leg during last Thursday's rampage.   The plant worker was one of 13 wounded when Joseph T. Wesbeckersprayed the Standard Gravure Corp. with gunfire from an AK-47 rifle.Wesbecker, who then killed himself, had been on permanent disabilityleave from the plant for the past year because of mental illness.   In a full-page ad Monday in The Courier-Journal, the LouisvilleCouncil on Peacemaking and Religion called for the abolition ofassault weapons, saying it felt ``compelled to say enough isenough.''   The group said that society shares part of the blame for allowingthe assault weapons to be sold legally.   ``The blame can no longer be placed solely on the psychologicallydisturbed individuals who find ways to acquire these deadly weaponsand who use them with such abandon,'' the ad said. ``The accompliceto the crime is the legality of their acquisition.''   Pat McCuen, co-director of the council, said the ad was anexercise in grassroots democracy.   ``Most peole are starting to feel like they're under siege. TheUnited States is starting to look like a war zone.''   Also Monday, Handgun Control Inc. placed a three-quarters page adin the Louisville newspaper featuring Sarah Brady, wife of formerpresidential press secretary James Brady, who was injured in theattempted assassination of President Reagan in 1981.   The ad sought contributions to finance lobbying efforts for``sensible, effective gun laws.''   ``This is your chance to break the gun lobby's death grip onCongress,'' Mrs. Brady said in the ad. ``Together, we can beat theNational Rifle Association ... and keep handguns out of the wronghands.''   William Smith, NRA representative of the Kentucky League ofSportsmen, said legislation to ban weapons would not prevent similarattacks.   ``You can't legislate against a nut,'' he said.   The gun shop owner in Louisville who sold Wesbecker the AK-47 anda MAC-11 pistol said he had decided to quit special ordering thesemiautomatic weapons for customers.   ``The weapons are so controversial right now that we just don'twant to fool with them any longer,'' said Jack Tilford, owner ofTilford's Gun Sales.</TEXT></DOC>
