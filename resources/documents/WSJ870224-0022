IbrahimStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 02/24/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> MDESTPETROLEUM (PET)MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON) </IN><DATELINE> PARIS  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The December agreement of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to hold prices at around $18 a barrel is coming under intense pressure as an increasing number of oil companies decline to buy OPEC oil at fixed prices.    Meanwhile, world oil prices plunged yesterday to two-month lows of about $17 a barrel amid continuing concerns about OPEC overproduction.    Industry sources say that as the list of companies walking away from agreements with OPEC producers grows, the group's production is dropping. In some OPEC countries, such as Qatar, it is down as much as one-third. Moreover, industry sources warn, demand for some OPEC oil next month may be close to nil.    &quot;There is a crisis of confidence&quot; in OPEC's ability to maintain its price and production agreement, said Nordine Ait-Laoussine, managing director of Nalcosa, a Geneva, Switzerland, oil consultant who served as senior OPEC delegate for Algeria in the past. &quot;OPEC must hang tight over the next few weeks as the storm passes.&quot;    The problem is potentially self-correcting if declines in OPEC output shrink world supplies enough to boost prices. But if OPEC members begin secret price discounting, as some members fear could occur in coming weeks, then OPEC's cohesion would be in serious jeopardy. So far, however, there isn't any evidence of such discounting.    Saudi Arabia, Iran, Nigeria and, above all, tiny Qatar are among the hardest hit by the current sales decline. OPEC expected some resistance in February when it substituted official prices for the free market that had prevailed for much of the past two years. But the situation has taken on what one OPEC official, who asked not to be identified, described as &quot;worrisome overtones&quot; in the past three weeks.    Oil industry sources and Arab officials say Qatar's production has fallen nearly one-third from its assigned quota of 285,000 barrels a day. More importantly, Qatar seems unable to line up any clients at all for next month to buy its oil at the official OPEC prices of $17.82 a barrel and $17.67 a barrel for its two principal crudes.    Saudi production is down to 3.8 million barrels a day from its quota of 4.3 million barrels a day. Iranian production is down about 150,000 barrels a day from its 2.2 million-barrels-a-day peak last month. Nigeria's output has fallen 100,000 barrels daily from its quota of 1.3 million barrels, sources say. More OPEC members are expected to feel the pressure next month, industry sources assert. &quot;They are all going to get hit,&quot; says Humphrey Harrison, an oil analyst for Natwest Investment Bank County Ltd., a London brokerage firm. &quot;Oil refineries around the world are operating at minimum capacity and there will be a substantial downturn in demand for oil in March.&quot;    Pressure on OPEC has mounted as free-market prices have fallen during February as far as $2 to $3 a barrel below the official OPEC average of $18. Causing the drop has been a marked increased in supplies of oil and refined products on world markets, partly as a result of cheating by several oil cartel members that have overproduced their quotas. This has been compounded by abundant inventories held by oil companies and mild weather in Western Europe, signaling an end to peak winter demand.    OPEC's growing difficulties were the subject of an emergency meeting in Qatar of the Gulf Cooperation Council -- Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Oman -- that lasted past midnight Sunday.    They warned oil companies to refrain from playing OPEC countries against one another for price advantage and hinted at a solidarity plan to counter such moves.    The Gulf Cooperation Council countries, which include four OPEC members, said they have resolved to &quot;find appropriate solutions to assist members in case it became obvious that some countries are unable to market (oil) due to company pressures that can affect the (OPEC) agreement on prices and volumes.&quot; The Gulf Cooperation Council, which is led by Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, said those among its members best able to market oil will assist those who can't.    Some ministers also made a veiled threat to oil companies that are seen as discriminating against small producers to force them to give price concessions. &quot;If one of the international oil companies refrained from buying oil from any of the GCC countries in an attempt to pressure it into accepting a price below the official level, none of the other GCC countries will compensate the company for the lost quantities and won't sell it anything in excess of the already contracted amounts,&quot; said Kuwait's oil minister, Ali Khalifa Al-Sabah.    The six countries also urged all OPEC members to stand fast by OPEC's pact. OPEC sources hinted that an emergency OPEC meeting could be called if the situation worsens appreciably in March, but the communique mentioned no such plan.    Saudi Arabia has emerged as the guardian angel of the OPEC accord that it strove alongside Iran to fashion. Iran's oil minister, Gholamreza Agazadeh, said Monday that he was confident that OPEC's plan for maintaining prices will succeed, and he expressed his &quot;full support&quot; of the Gulf Cooperation Council decisions.    Many traders were disappointed that the Gulf Cooperation Council meeting didn't produce concrete signs that OPEC was taking steps to arrest recent quota violations by some cartel members.    Oil prices on spot and futures markets had rallied Friday in anticipation that the weekend meeting would produce further cuts by OPEC producers or other moves to shore up prices.    But when little materialized, many traders sold contracts to offset those bought earlier, driving down prices and attracting strong speculator interest, analysts said. &quot;The sharks smelled blood,&quot; said Richard Marose, an oil analyst for Stotler andamp; Co., Chicago, referring to active speculator selling late in the day.    The meeting's result &quot;is making it clear that internal problems within OPEC still exist,&quot; said Nauman Barakat, oil analyst for Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co., New York. &quot;It probably would have been better had they not had the meeting at all.&quot;    Crude oil prices for April delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange plunged 56 cents, to $17.08 a barrel -- the largest one-day decline since late October. The last time crude oil futures prices traded as low was Dec. 23, when they stood at $16.91 a barrel. Meanwhile, March heating oil contracts plummeted 1.83 cents a gallon, to 45.83 cents, and March unleaded gasoline prices skidded 1.57 cents, to 46.99 cents a gallon.    The spot, or non-contract, market also posted sharp losses. The spot price of West Texas Intermediate, the bellwether U.S. crude, tumbled 75 cents, to $17 a barrel. And the March spot price of North Sea Brent, the abundantly traded European blend, fell 30 cents, also to $17 a barrel.    Some analysts and brokers said, moreover, that further price declines are likely if quota violations aren't corrected, especially as demand softens with spring approaching. &quot;OPEC rhetoric alone isn't going to be enough to hold up prices,&quot; said Chris McCormack, an oil broker for E.D. andamp; F. Man International Futures Inc., New York.    Smith Barney's Mr. Barakat, for one, said he expects prices to soon trade in the $14 to $16 range if OPEC overproduction and product oversupply continues. &quot;OPEC euphoria is evaporating very quickly,&quot; he said.    Meanwhile, other analysts insist the Saudis will step in and cut output to offset any significant OPEC cheating, keeping a lid on oil-price declines. Ian Gibson, a vice president at Kleinwort, Grieveson Securities, a New York unit of Kleinwort Benson Inc., said oil prices likely won't fall below $16 a barrel. &quot;Nobody's interested in another oil-price war,&quot; he said.    ---   Michael Siconolfi in New York contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
