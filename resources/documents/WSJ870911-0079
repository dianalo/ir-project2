Boesky bought 9.9% of California's Columbia Savings andamp; Loan Association in 1984, an adviser asked him why he had made such a large investment in a company whose financial prospects he admittedly knew little about.    The takeover speculator replied simply that &quot;Milken told me to,&quot; the adviser recalls.    Milken is Michael R. Milken, the head of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s junk bond operations, and Columbia is a major purchaser of the bonds Mr. Milken sells -- bonds that raise much of the cash that fuels numerous Drexel-backed takeovers and buy-outs. At Mr. Milken's behest, Columbia later invested in Mr. Boesky's limited partnership, which speculated in takeover stocks (although Columbia initially balked, a person involved in the partnership's financing says).    Was Mr. Milken indeed giving orders to Mr. Boesky, a leading arbitrager? And also to Columbia, a major purchaser of junk bonds? This possibility is a central element in the government's widening investigation of insider trading and other wrongdoing on Wall Street, according to those familiar with the government's lines of questioning.    Drexel calls the idea preposterous. &quot;Michael doesn't give orders,&quot; says Frederick Joseph, Drexel's chief executive.    Nevertheless, the scope of the questioning suggests that the government's investigation has moved well beyond the boundaries of the case against Mr. Boesky that shook Wall Street last year. Far from languishing, the government investigation of Drexel has accelerated this summer and now shapes up as the biggest investigation of an investment-banking firm in Wall Street's history.    Columbia isn't the only situation involving Drexel and Drexel clients that has surfaced in the investigation this summer. Other matters government investigators are closely scrutinizing include:    --The 1986 leveraged buy-out of Safeway Stores Inc.    --The 1984 buy-out of SFN Cos.    --Last year's takeover of TRE Corp.    --And a threatened buy-out last year of Staley Continental Inc.    Investigators have also shown renewed interest in the buy-out of Harris Graphics Corp., a transaction that has figured in the government's investigation for many months.    These matters involve some of Wall Street's most prominent names -- Saul Steinberg, the Haft family, and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. But under the government's apparent hypothesis, Mr. Milken is the master strategist, and he works this way:    From his X-shaped desk in Beverly Hills, he directs clients to take investment positions that enable them to earn large trading profits. And he asks the clients to reciprocate by buying junk bonds to help finance Drexel-backed transactions. He identifies potential target companies. He raises money for the raiders who threaten or launch the takeover bids, and he finds the financing for leveraged buy-outs that he proposes. He protects the buyers of junk bonds by making a market in the bonds, but by then some of the buyers are largely in his control anyway.    In and of itself, none of this may be illegal. But lawyers representing recipients of subpoenas and people who have recently been questioned by investigators say the government appears to be using its hypothesis as a guide to dig for evidence of possible securities-law violations: misuse of inside information about impending buy-out proposals or tender offers, assembling blocks of stock in friendly hands without complying with disclosure requirements, and &quot;parking&quot; stock to disguise its true ownership.    This approach appears to be carrying investigators far beyond the matters that have surfaced previously. Last April, Mr. Boesky pleaded guilty to a conspiracy felony involving Victor Posner's 1985 takeover of Fischbach Corp., a plea that established the notion of a criminal takeover conspiracy and referred pointedly to unnamed conspirators. As reported then, people familiar with the investigation identified Mr. Milken as an alleged conspirator, though the government didn't mention him or Drexel by name. At the time, a Drexel spokesman said the firm didn't know of any such arrangement involving Boesky's Fischbach shares and declined further comment.    Fischbach also figures in a $5.3 million payment from Mr. Boesky to Drexel that may be part of an illegal parking arrangement. Drexel contends the payment is a legitimate investment-banking fee, and Drexel and Mr. Milken have denied any wrongdoing.    The scope of the investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, involving several stocks that haven't been mentioned previously in connection with the $5.3 million fee, suggests that the government is looking for evidence that would support a far bigger case -- one that could strike at the heart of the recent takeover and buy-out boom.    In its expanded investigation, the government can't afford to err. The embarrassing dismissal last May of insider-trading charges against three prominent arbitragers is a stark reminder of the perils of haste. So investigators are wading through millions of documents and examining hundreds of witnesses, by some estimates.    Final decisions on whether indictments or lawsuits will be pursued against Mr. Milken or Drexel aren't expected before January.    Mr. Milken declines comment on this story. Drexel says it has &quot;thoroughly reviewed&quot; the five transactions mentioned, as well as &quot;voluminous files&quot; it has provided the government, and hasn't found any wrongdoing by anyone at Drexel, including Mr. Milken. Drexel's Mr. Joseph says he has gained confidence as the government's investigation continues: &quot;The good news is we are going to survive it quite nicely. Yes, we've lost momentum. That's life.&quot; Drexel has passed the word to clients that the government is engaged in a huge fishing expedition and is having trouble making a case against Drexel.    Building a criminal case of this scope is an awesome undertaking, even with the cooperation of key witnesses. That various Drexel-inspired buy-outs and takeovers occurred is a matter of public record. But proving that securities laws were violated in the process, if they were, may require evidence of such elusive elements as motive, intent and causation. Drexel contends that such evidence won't be found because there was no wrongdoing. Moreover, the government faces practical obstacles. If Mr. Milken had a central role, who else really knows the facts about these events, and who would be a credible witness?    The government's pool of potentially friendly witnesses is surprisingly small. People involved in the investigation say that Wall Street appears to have generally closed ranks behind Drexel in opposition to the broad theory of criminality it fears the government is pursuing. Even some officials of firms that have openly criticized Drexel have, in testimony this summer, characterized events in the most benign terms possible. &quot;The government's lawyers simply aren't being told what they want to hear,&quot; says one lawyer whose client has been questioned extensively. &quot;I sense they are growing increasingly frustrated.&quot;    The U.S. attorney's office and the SEC enforcement division won't comment on this or any other aspect of this story. But others familiar with the progress of their work say that the investigation is proceeding smoothly and that testimony gathered over the summer hasn't caused them to question the thrust of the investigation.    The situations under investigation that, at least on the basis of circumstantial evidence, raise the most questions about Drexel's conduct are Staley and Safeway. In Staley, a situation that has come under increasing scrutiny by the government this summer, investigators do have a fertile source of potentially friendly witnesses. Alone among the companies known to figure in the investigation, Staley has filed its own civil suit against Drexel, charging the firm with an &quot;extortionate attempt&quot; to force Staley into a &quot;Drexel-Staley management leveraged buy-out group.&quot;    Staley claims that Drexel officials contacted the company beginning last Nov. 3, manipulated trading in Staley's stock to convince the company it was &quot;in play,&quot; then tried to threaten and cajole Staley into a leveraged buy-out. What is striking about the details of Staley's allegations, which Drexel says are &quot;totally without merit,&quot; is how closely they parallel the scenario being scrutinized by the government, including advance accumulations of stock by Drexel clients and a proposed leveraged buy-out in which Drexel would play a role.    Some startling evidence has emerged in the Staley suit. James Dahl, an official in Drexel's Beverly Hills office, said in a &quot;declaration&quot; submitted in the suit that beginning last Nov. 3, he bought Staley stock for Drexel's account and recommended the stock to four Drexel customers who bought large positions. One of them is an affiliate of Columbia Savings andamp; Loan. The others are CenTrust Savings Bank Association, Morgan Partnership and Lincoln Savings andamp; Loan Association. CenTrust, based in Miami, and Lincoln, based in Irvine, Calif., are major purchasers of Drexel junk bonds, along with Columbia. Morgan is controlled by the Haft family. The Hafts, who are Drexel clients and have become known as corporate raiders, control Dart Group Corp. of Landover, Md.    Mr. Dahl's disclosures thus lend credence to Staley's claim that Drexel was behind the price and volume run-up that suggested Staley was in play. On the crucial question of why he recommended the purchases, however, Mr. Dahl offered an innocent explanation. He said he believed Staley's stock to be &quot;undervalued,&quot; basing his opinion on a research report by Drexel food analyst Alan Greditor. He specifically denied that Drexel and the purchasers were acting as a group that should have filed SEC disclosure documents. He said that &quot;no agreement of any kind existed with any of them (the customers) or anyone else in regard to taking any joint action with respect to Staley.&quot; SEC rules require investors to disclose when they own 5% or more of a company's stock by filing a so-called 13D form.    Staley's complaint says it was Mr. Dahl who called Staley proposing a Drexel-led leveraged buy-out soon after the stock purchases by Drexel and its customers. Staley claims Mr. Dahl said that &quot;it is very important for us to sit down and talk before you do something that hurts me and before I do something that hurts you,&quot; adding that &quot;the next thing that happens is someone files a 13D at $40 a share and management is thrown out.&quot;    Mr. Dahl's declaration doesn't address those allegations, which, if true, seem to link accumulation of Staley's stock to a takeover threat and raise questions about whether Mr. Dahl knew he was going to propose a leveraged buy-out when he encouraged Drexel customers to buy Staley's stock.    Drexel's Mr. Joseph calls Staley's allegations &quot;outrageous.&quot; He acknowledges that some of the statements attributed to Mr. Dahl were made but says that others weren't. He says that he doesn't believe Drexel customers' holdings in Staley were ever large enough to require a 13D filing.    David Paul, the chairman of CenTrust, says the company bought Staley stock on Drexel's recommendation and sold it several days later at a profit. A spokesman for Lincoln Savings says that the company has been subpoenaed but that the SEC hasn't suggested any impropriety by Lincoln. Mr. Paul and the Lincoln spokesman declined further comment, and a spokesman for the Hafts declined comment, as did a Staley spokesman.    The role of the Haft family is also under scrutiny by the SEC in last year's buy-out of Safeway Stores Inc., the large California-based grocery chain. The Hafts launched a hostile bid for Safeway, using financing arranged by Drexel. To fend off the Hafts, Safeway agreed to a leveraged buy-out led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., the leveraged-buy-out firm with close ties to Drexel. Although Kohlberg Kravis was represented by Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. and Safeway had long been represented by Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., Drexel ended up with the lucrative task of financing the leveraged buy-out -- a turn of events that astounded some participants.    In Safeway, Kohlberg Kravis used the threatening presence of the Hafts to press a reluctant Safeway into a leveraged buy-out, a sequence that resembles the process under investigation by the government. Safeway's chief executive, Peter Magowan, told San Francisco Business Times in August that Kohlberg Kravis actually approached Safeway about a leveraged buy-out before the Hafts surfaced. &quot;I said 'no,'&quot; Mr. Magowan told Business Times. &quot;When the Hafts started buying stock, they (Kohlberg Kravis) asked again. We said 'no' again. At some point I changed my mind. . . . I became convinced that the company would fall into the hands of the Hafts if we did not arrange something else. We believed that a leveraged buy-out was not the best alternative, but it was best at the time.&quot;    A spokeswoman for Safeway said that Mr. Magowan wouldn't comment now that the matter is being investigated. However, she said the Business Times account is accurate. Safeway declined further comment.    At the time of the Hafts' bid, Safeway filed a lawsuit that, while it didn't name Drexel as a defendant, foreshadowed Staley's allegations in its suit. Safeway charged that arbitragers and other &quot;market professionals&quot; were selectively tipped about the Hafts' interest in Safeway as part of a scheme to put Safeway in play. The Hafts denied those allegations.    The lawsuit was dropped when Safeway succumbed to the leveraged buy-out, and participants agreed not to discuss the basis for the allegations or what was disclosed in connection with the suit. A lawyer for Safeway, however, confirms that Mr. Boesky did have a position in Safeway prior to the Hafts' bid, and a member of Mr. Boesky's staff gave a deposition before the suit was dropped. The SEC has subpoenaed trading records relating to Safeway, which would reveal whether anyone else linked to Drexel may have held substantial positions prior to the Hafts' or Kohlberg Kravis's bids.    The SEC has also been asking questions about Drexel's ability to garner the financing role in the leveraged buy-out despite its earlier representation of a hostile bidder, apparently trying to determine whether Drexel had any undisclosed understanding with Kohlberg Kravis.    Mr. Joseph, the chief executive, says that Drexel knew nothing about Kohlberg Kravis's interest in Safeway before it was disclosed publicly and that Drexel received the Hafts' permission to handle the financing. He adds that it isn't unusual for Drexel to step in to handle the financing in a deal where it originally represented a competing bidder.    Both Mr. Joseph and a spokesman for Kohlberg Kravis say that Drexel got the Safeway financing business because it offered better terms than any other contender, including Morgan Stanley. However, the Kohlberg Kravis spokesman acknowledges that Kohlberg Kravis didn't approach any other firms seeking better terms. He denies that Kohlberg Kravis engaged in any collusion with the Hafts or anyone at Drexel in order to force Safeway into a leveraged buy-out, one financed largely by debt. Spokesmen for Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch and the Hafts decline comment.    Some similar facts emerge in takeovers of three other companies currently under investigation: SFN, TRE, and Harris Graphics. SFN underwent a leveraged buy-out with Drexel's help in 1985, and Drexel acquired an equity stake in the company. Mr. Boesky had a stake in SFN prior to the buy-out. So did E.M. Warburg Pincus andamp; Co., a New York securities firm.    At the time of the leveraged buy-out, SFN's chairman and president, John R. Purcell, indicated that the buy-out was thrust upon the company by activity that suggested a takeover. According to a Wall Street Journal article in January 1985, Mr. Purcell &quot;said the company decided to go private because of worries there might be an unfriendly takeover.&quot; Participants, however, now say that Mr. Purcell knew of no takeover threat and that it was Mr. Purcell and Warburg Pincus -- not Drexel -- who proposed a buy-out. Mr. Purcell declined comment, as did Warburg Pincus.    TRE was acquired by Aluminum Co. of America last year after a hostile bid for control of the California-based electronics company by Giant Group Ltd., a company headed by Hollywood producer Burt Sugarman. Drexel declined to represent Mr. Sugarman in the bid, but it co-managed a bond offering for Giant, the proceeds of which were used to buy TRE stock.    At least one other Drexel client, a company headed by corporate raider Saul Steinberg, accumulated a large stake in TRE during Giant's bid for control, a development that may have helped pressure the company into merging with whiteknight Alcoa. Mr. Steinberg also acquired a large stake in Harris Graphics prior to its leveraged buy-out in 1986. Drexel officials were major shareholders in Harris and helped to arrange the buy-out. Recent questioning by SEC investigators suggests that the government is trying to determine whether an undisclosed group was at work in these situations and whether inside information was involved.    Mr. Joseph says of Harris Graphics that &quot;the pattern is innocent. It was good for all participants. Everybody made money.&quot; A spokesman for Mr. Steinberg's Reliance Group says the investments in both Harris and TRE were the result of Reliance's own research. Giant Group's Mr. Sugarman declines comment.    What the government is looking for in Columbia remains a mystery, although the cast of characters is intriguing, involving a confluence of raiders, arbitragers and financiers linked to Drexel. Columbia's SEC filings show the following holders of the equivalent of more than 5% of Columbia's stock as of March 1985: Drexel, 10.2%; Richard V. Sandler, Mr. Milken's personal lawyer and a trustee for unidentified beneficiaries, 9.9%; Integrated Resources Inc., a major Drexel client, 9.8%; Mr. Boesky, 9.8%; Martin Sosnoff, another Drexel client and corporate raider, 9.7%.    A crucial question is why, in late 1984, Drexel clients would have converged on Columbia. Were they acting as an undisclosed group, and if so, for what purpose? Columbia was once rumored to be considering a leveraged buy-out, but none ever materialized. In early 1985, Columbia launched an arbitrage operation with Mr. Boesky's help, and its arbitragers had free access to Mr. Boesky's research staff. Columbia earned large trading profits that year, causing its stock to soar, producing handsome gains for Drexel and its associates who held the positions.    Drexel's Mr. Joseph says he isn't familiar with details of the Columbia matter and wasn't aware it was under investigation. He says he doesn't know whether Drexel recommended the purchases of Columbia stock by Mr. Boesky and others, but adds, &quot;It's not uncommon for us or our people to recommend a security.&quot; Columbia has been &quot;clear and away the most successful&quot; of thrifts, he says.    David Sachs, a Columbia senior vice president, says Columbia has never had an arbitrage department so Mr. Boesky couldn't have helped set one up. &quot;We have occasionally invested in a company that was in play,&quot; he acknowledges.    Harvey Eisen, the Integrated official who oversaw the company's investment in Columbia, says Integrated &quot;discovered Columbia independently. We invested because we thought it was an outstanding value, and we tripled our money.&quot; Asked specifically whether anyone at Drexel had brought the stock to Integrated's attention or recommended the investment, Mr. Eisen says, &quot;As you know, Drexel is the investment banker for both&quot; Columbia and Integrated, but he reiterates that Integrated made its own decision. Mr. Sosnoff declines comment. Mr. Sandler didn't return calls.    People familiar with Drexel's strategy say that some officials of the firm believe that the government won't succeed in building the broad case it seems to be investigating and will be left with the decision whether to seek indictments based on the evidence it has accumulated about the $5.3 million payment and the Fischbach situation. If the government can be convinced that Mr. Milken is a &quot;national treasure,&quot; as he has been characterized by Drexel partisans, then perhaps the government will choose not to file criminal charges.    Mr. Milken, after years of shunning the press, has granted a series of interviews with national publications to promote junk bonds and a new approach to the world's debt crisis. He refuses to discuss anything under investigation. He has posed for photographs and talked about his wife and children. As a Drexel spokesman said at a recent press briefing, Drexel is trying to &quot;show the world that Milken isn't a monster.&quot;    During the current lull in prosecutions, Drexel has tried to plant doubts about the quality of Mr. Boesky's disclosures and to suggest that the duration of the investigation shows that the government's case is weak. Drexel's interpretations have been readily accepted on Wall Street, where many traders measure long-term investments in days. The firm has suddenly reemerged in the hostile-takeover arena by financing recent bids for Newmont Mining Corp. (by T. Boone Pickens Jr.) and Kenner Parker Toys Inc. It is backing GAF Corp.'s recently proposed leveraged buyout by management.    Mr. Joseph says those developments are coincidental. He insists that Drexel's strategy has only three components: to cooperate with the authorities; to keep its constituencies informed, especially employees; and to continue doing business. While he says he now is more confident than ever that Drexel will survive and &quot;be a strong financial institution when this is over,&quot; he also says the investigation could last two to three years. And he adds, &quot;I can't predict the outcome.&quot;    ---               Five Deals Under Investigation NAME      TRANSACTION  DREXEL ROLE        FOCUS OF                                           INQUIRY Columbia  None known   Major purchaser    Why did Drexel  Savings               of Drexel's        clients accumulate  andamp; Loan                junk bonds         large positions in                                           Columbia?
