Except for one thing: She's wearing maternityissue because she's eight months pregnant.   While the 25-year-old petty officer from Boston, who askedthat her last name not be used, is happy about the birth ofher first child in later this month, the Navy doesn't shareher joy.</LP><TEXT>   Kathleen got pregnant while deployed on the U.S.S. Acadiaduring the Persian Gulf War. Kathleen was one of 36 Navywomen who returned home pregnant from their tour on theAcadia. The ship was dubbed &quot;The Love Boat&quot; in a newspapercartoon, which showed women sailors saluting the rabbits whohad sacrificed their lives as pregnancy testers during thewar, and the nickname was picked up by the national media.   But to the Navy, the spate of births coming roughly ninemonths after the war isn't funny. Women today make up 30% ofthe Navy's crews, a figure that is expected to rise to 50% by1996. And despite the Navy's strict rules against&quot;fraternization,&quot; about 16% of the 8,600 Navy women on shipduty get pregnant each year.   &quot;Hanky-panky -- hetero and homo -- is a problem,&quot; saysCharles Moskos, a military sociologist at NorthwesternUniversity. &quot;Propinquity breeds romance.&quot; Yet nobody in themacho military world &quot;really wants to look at it,&quot; he says.   Although all branches of the military -- indeed, mostplaces where men and women work together -- are crucibles foroffice romance, the Navy throws the sexes together in tightquarters for months at a time. Life on the floating factoriesis often described as drudgery. During the day, sailors' jobskeep them busy, but at night there's little to do. Sailorssay the food on board is so bad they call hamburgers&quot;sliders&quot; because they're so greasy. On some ships, sailorssleep in huge rooms stacked with tiny berths.   On the Acadia, about 360 of the ship's 1,250 crew werewomen. Some, like Kathleen, processed paperwork, while othersworked alongside men in every function, making pipes,repairing equipment and working in the foundry. Women arestill not allowed on combat ships or submarines.   Although men and women used separate bunks and bathroomson different decks of the Acadia, they ate, watchedtelevision and played cards together. And while the bunksthemselves are only two feet wide and offer little privacy,there's a maze of places to hide on board.   To the Navy, a pregnant sailor represents the loss of atrained worker, sometimes in an extremely technical position,as well as a potential health problem. Once a woman'spregnancy is known, she is quickly dispatched to a job onshore. The Navy used to routinely discharge pregnant women,but now, after a six-week paid maternity leave, they areexpected to come back to work. Four months after givingbirth, they are expected to resume their sea duty, whichtypically totals three years. Many ask for dischargesinstead, and because it's a volunteer force, most get them.   The military's record on sex issues has long been spotty.Fifteen years after women were first admitted to West Pointand the Naval Academy in Annapolis, complaints of sexualharassment still crop up. Enforcement of &quot;no fraternization&quot;rules isn't consistent. The military's stand against lettinghomosexuals serve has been challenged repeatedly in court. Sofar, it has prevailed.   But even more than the other branches of the military, theNavy has resisted confronting women's issues and themanagement of a co-ed fleet, asserts Rep. Patricia Schroederof Colorado. &quot;It takes very strong women to go into the Navy.They're not getting any support.&quot; Rep. Schroeder also saysNavy women feel they have &quot;to have sex or you get labeled asa lesbian. So women are damned if they do and damned if theydon't.&quot;   In a report on women in the Navy, which was prepared in1987 and updated last year, the service acknowledged majorproblems in its handling of women's issues. The report saidNavy women complained about sexual harassment, rape(&quot;seriously under-reported&quot;) and lack of day care.   Yet even some women have doubts about whether motherhoodand the military mix. Some privately fear the soft image ofmotherhood makes others take women less seriously as sailors.&quot;Motherhood is natural, but there's a time and place for it,&quot;says Lt. Commander Darlene Iskra, the first woman commanderof a naval ship, the U.S.S. Opportune, a rescue and salvageship that patrolled the Mediterranean during the war. Anotherwoman gets angry about the pregnancies. &quot;If one female doessomething wrong, we all get labeled,&quot; says Kathleen Smith, a24-year-old ensign from Buffalo assigned to the U.S.S.Yellowstone.   Sailors are allowed to date each other, but sex on shipsis considered &quot;detrimental to good order and discipline,&quot;says Lt. Commander Maureen Davidovich, who works on womens'policy issues for the Navy. Acknowledging that many sailorswill have sex somewhere, the Navy has begun offering more sexeducation classes and free birth-control pills and condoms.Yet the Navy report said women sailors complained of longwaits to see gynecologists or to get contraception. And somewomen told the Navy that the pills they got were dispensedbeyond their expiration date.   To enforce the no-sex rules aboard ship, watches includechecks of dark corners and locked rooms. Shay Holliday is a21-year-old sailor on board the USN Joshua Humphreys, anoiler that provided fuel and moved cargo in the Gulf. Men andwomen aboard the Joshua Humphreys are allowed to visit eachother's private rooms until 11 p.m. But last year Ms.Holliday and her boyfriend, a civilian mariner assigned tothe military sealift command, returned to her stateroom afteran evening of drinking in port. &quot;I was very drunk and he wastoo,&quot; she says. &quot;And we got caught.&quot;   Her penalty for the tryst was stiff: She was restricted tothe ship for a week and lost $200 in pay. In August, Ms.Holliday and her boyfriend were married.   Navy rules say that anyone who is caught in physicalcontact with another sailor must be punished. Sailors canlose a stripe or get kicked out of the service. Two maleofficers on shore duty at an East Coast base last year werefined $30,000 because of &quot;inappropriate relations&quot; withenlisted women, according to the Navy. But depending on thecommanding officer, the sanctions can vary widely. &quot;If theylook the other way when grab-assing is going on, they'll lookthe other way when more serious things go on,&quot; says Ms.Iskra, the U.S.S. Opportune's commander.   Because of the rules, many women sailors say they try toavoid romantic relationships with people on the same ship. &quot;Iwon't date somebody I work with,&quot; says Nancy Murray, anelectronics technician on the Yellowstone. Twenty of theship's 479 women came home pregnant from the Gulf.   Others say women have to guard against becoming targets ofshipboard scuttlebutt about who's sleeping with whom. &quot;Rumorsspread like wildfire,&quot; says Monique Code, Petty Officer, 3rdClass, on the Yellowstone. &quot;People get labeled as beingeasy.&quot;   Kathleen's relationship with her now-husband, Ed, on boardship was strictly platonic, she says during an interviewsurrounded by two fidgeting Navy public affairs officers andher supervisor. She sits with arms folded and answersbriefly.   The Navy says most war-time pregnancies began on shore,and that's where Kathleen says hers began -- on liberty inDubai in the United Arab Emirates. When her pregnancy wasrevealed, she was immediately reassigned to shore duty inMarch. &quot;I got on my hands and knees and begged to stay&quot; onthe ship, she says. But even though her pregnancy wouldn'tseem to interfere with her shipboard job as a personnelclerk, her plea was rejected. She was sent to San Diego,where she works in the same kind of job. Ed, a 29-year-oldboiler repairman and nine-year Navy veteran, stayed with theship. The Acadia docked a month later.   Couples were common on the Acadia, Kathleen says; at leastfour planned to marry after the war. Indeed, statisticsindicate Navy marriages have been commonplace: Dr. Moskossays three-quarters of the married women in the Navy aremarried to Navy men.   Some sailors suspect that some women get pregnant just toescape the drudgery of Navy life. But Kathleen says leavingthe ship was traumatic. &quot;It really upset me to see the shipcome in and I wasn't on it,&quot; she says, recalling how shestood on the pier watching the Acadia dock in San Diego lastApril.   Kathleen plans to remain in the Navy after her baby isborn, at least until her tour of duty is up in 1993. Butthat's not easy to do. Carolyn Judah, a 28-year-oldelectronics specialist on the Joshua Humphreys who is asingle mother, had to leave her two-year-old daughter withfriends for three months during the war. &quot;The separation isreal difficult,&quot; she says, describing herself as &quot;lucky&quot; tobe able to call home once a month.   Meantime, Kathleen is trying to adhere to the Navy's ruleson pregnancy, which are spelled out in a 35-page manualcalled &quot;Management of Pregnant Servicewomen.&quot; &quot;During thelast three months of pregnancy, the servicewoman shall beallowed to rest 20 minutes every four hours,&quot; says themanual. &quot;Sitting in a chair with feet up is acceptable.&quot;   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          WOMEN COMPRISE as much as 38% of crews on some of theNavy's 60 noncombat vessels, but only 4.7% of all peopleassigned to ships. An earlier edition misstated thepercentages.   (WSJ Oct. 11, 1991)   911003-0030</TEXT></DOC>
