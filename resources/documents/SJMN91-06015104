The other is laughing uproariously, obviously delighted at awitticism uttered by her companion, unless I'm reading too much into this.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  THOSE UNDERWEAR ADS AREN'T EVEN BARELY BELIEVABLE  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Cowherd is a columnist for the Baltimore Evening Sun.  </MEMO><TEXT>     What makes the picture so unsettling (at least to me) is that both womenare dressed only in their underwear. Bras and panties, that's it. Maybethey're wearing shoes -- there's some sort of huge fern at their feet and youreally can't tell.;    But the focus is definitely on their underwear and soonyou arrive at the terrifying realization that this is an advertisement for anationally known brand of lingerie.;    I don't know -- maybe it's me. Maybethis advertisement makes perfect sense.;    Maybe it'll have women everywhereracing wild-eyed into clothing stores, waving their checkbooks and chargecards and shouting at startled sales clerks: &quot;Those two on the hotel balcony-- gimme what they're wearing!&quot;;    Fine. It's just that -- well, when I seethis picture, all sorts of questions run through my mind.;    No. 1, what arethese women doing outside in their underwear? Is this normal behavior? (Let'snot even get into the various state and municipal laws on nudity. Besides,what difference does it make? The cops are too busy tracking down murderersand dope dealers to worry about a couple of kinky babes in their Playtexflashing passers-by from the sixth floor of the Sheraton or wherever.);   Another thing that puzzles me: How did these two women reach the joint (Iassume) decision to rendezvous in their underwear?;    We can only speculateon the thinking that went on here. Did one call up the other and whisper:&quot;Psst, meet you on the balcony. And remember: No clothes. Just, you know, brasand panties.&quot;;    People don't simply arrive at a place in just theirunderwear, is what I'm saying. Even at the wildest nightclub, a woman in braand panties would be told by the bouncer: &quot;Lady, throw a bathrobe aroundyourself, for God's sake!&quot;;    Or maybe she wouldn't. I don't get out muchanymore. The point is that underwear advertisers persist in showing theirmodels socializing -- no, cavorting (God, I love that word) -- in the mostimprobable scenarios.;    This is hardly limited to ads for lingerie, either.One of the most bizarre ads I've ever seen (this goes back a few years) showeda man in his underwear standing at a bus stop, with his briefcase tucked underone arm.;    Milling around the man were 50 or so fellow commuters -- none ofwhom, it must be pointed out, seemed to find anything odd about thesituation.;    Now, I'm sorry. But if that isn't cavorting, then I don't knowwhat is. At a bus stop! In his underwear!;    Has any man ever -- ever --appeared at a bus stop in real life clad only in his underwear? Without havinga net thrown over him and being wrestled into the back of an ambulance, Imean?;    No. I think not. And yet the advertisement made it seem as if thissort of thing -- waiting for the crosstown bus in your skivvies -- happens allthe time.;    In fact, judging by the bored expressions on the faces of theother commuters pictured, this might have been the 12th guy to show up at thebus stop in his underwear that day.;    Well. Seems to me a more realistic adwould picture a man standing in his underwear in, oh, a locker room (not on ahotel balcony or at a bus stop, OK?);    And this man would be wearing arather sheepish expression, as if the full realization of being photographedwith no clothes on is finally sinking in.;    His hands would be crossed athis -- well, you know. Maybe he'd even have one knee coyly tucked over theother. Finally, his face would be bright crimson, which the photographer wouldnot airbrush out later because -- remember the key word here is realism --you're supposed to feel embarrassed at having your picture taken in yourunderwear! Which evidently was not the case with the young woman pictured inan ad some months ago wearing only a bra and panties in a firehouse.;    Youknew it was a firehouse because -- talk about clues -- there were boots, hosesand fire axes scattered in the background.;    Then again, with a womanwalking around in her underwear and a fire helmet, what else could it be?  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Kevin Cowherd column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910115  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  7D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  763  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday January 15, 199100015104,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
