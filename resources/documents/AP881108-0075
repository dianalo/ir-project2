The 78-year-old nun, who said she hoped to steer clear ofpolitical controversy, plans to establish a mission in Khayelitsha,an impoverished black township outside Cape Town.   ``To tell the truth, I don't know anything about politics,'' shetold reporters at Johannesburg's Jan Smuts Airport. ``What isimportant is that we love one another.''   Mother Teresa declined to comment on South Africa's politicalsituation and said she plans no meetings with government officialsduring her weeklong stay, which will include visits to the majorcities.   Asked if South Africa's poor had suffered because of thewhite-dominated government's policy, she replied: ``We are thegovernment, all of us. It is our duty to love and serve the poor,not only the duty of some people.''   Accompanying Mother Teresa were four nuns from India, England andBurundi, who will run the new mission that is to provide food,clothing, shelter and what she called ``tender, loving care to thepoorest of the poor.''   Archbishop Stephen Naidoo of Cape Town, who has repeatedlyinvited Mother Teresa to come to South Africa, welcomed her.   ``We need someone to show us how to live together, how totranscend the barriers of race and religion,'' he told the newsconference.   Among the 300 people greeting Mother Teresa at the airport wereabout 70 kindergarten children who sang in her honor.   Born in Skopje, Yugoslavia, of an ethnic Albanian family, MotherTeresa founded the Missionaries if Charity order in 1950 and becameknown as the Saint of Calcutta for her work with the poor in thatIndian city. She won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979 and has traveledwidely since then to establish 384 missions in 84 countries. Fortyof the missions are in Africa.</TEXT></DOC>
