Because of the stigma attached abroad to dealings with SouthAfrica, leaders in government, business, entertainment and sportsconsider clandestine tactics necessary.   An editorial in Business Day, a Johannesburg newspaper, said theNational Party government engages in ``a systematic concealment ofthe truth from the public. The idea of simple public accountabilityhas decayed so far that not only invasions, but even the salaries ofpublic servants are concealed.''   Base salaries of officials are disclosed but extensive allowancesfor homes, travel, cars and other expenses are not.   Peter Soal, a member of Parliament for the anti-apartheidProgressive Federal Party, declared it ``impossible for the averagecitizen to keep abreast of what's going on.''   This penchant for secrets reaches high levels. Foreign MinisterRoelof F. Botha peeled off for two days during a visit to Europewith President P.W. Botha, who is not related.   ``I am not prepared to say publicly exactly where I was, exceptto say I visited one or two countries in the East or in Africa,'' hesaid after rejoining the presidential party.   The government, controlled by the white minority, claims severalstatesmen from black Africa have paid clandestine visits to SouthAfrica in recent years.   Officials also say prominent blacks in South Africa havenegotiated secretly with the government about possible politicalreforms, but that identifying them might discredit those leaders inthe eyes of other blacks.   Much of the nation's foreign trade is enveloped in secrecy,particularly when it involves efforts to circumvent economicsanctions. The government says South Africa trades with 40 of the 50other African countries, but refuses to name them.   Statistics on arms imports and exports are secret, as is mostinformation about energy and the nuclear program..   South Africa does not say how much oil it consumes or where itcomes from. Disclosing information on how petroleum is obtained hasbeen made a crime to protect those supplying oil in violation of aU.N. embargo.   The Defense Act prohibits unauthorized reports about thecomposition and activities of the armed forces. Statistics on draftresistance are not revealed and past incursions into Angola havebeen kept secret.   South Africa did not confirm its renewed presence in Angola lastyear until many weeks after large numbers of troops crossed theborder. Military headquarters did not issue comprehensive statisticson casualties among its black troops involved in the campaign.   Members of Parliament have the right to ask Cabinet ministers forinformation and statistics that might not be disclosed otherwise,but ministers often refuse to respond on grounds disclosure wouldnot be in the national interest.   ``That answer has become more prevalent lately,'' Soal said in aninterview. ``The Nationalists have a passion for secrecy.''   Emergency regulations forbid unauthorized reports about detaineesor action by security forces. Justice Minister Kobie Coetzeerecently proposed restricting news reports of trials.   Because of the extensive international sports boycott, foreignathletes sometimes arrive using pseudonyms. Occasionally, with thecooperation of South African media, teams compete without theirnationality or the names of the players being disclosed.   On many occasions the locations of sports events are notannounced until foreign competitors are en route to South Africa andthus less susceptible to last-minute political pressure.   Even non-sports competitions can assume a cloak-and-daggeraspect. The departure of four young South African chefs for aninternational cooking contest this month was kept secret until theeve of their departure.   A white tiger arrived at the Pretoria Zoo in early October in atrade with an American zoo, which received a king cheetah. Zoodirector Willie Labuschagne said the zoo in the United States askednot to be identified.   Foreign film crews produce movies here secretly. They like therelatively low production costs but want to avoid internationalpublicity about the choice of locale.   The Star, the largest-selling daily newspaper, recentlyeditorialized on the extent of secrecy and concluded: ``It will benice, one day, to shout from the rooftops again.''</TEXT></DOC>
