Mice that could not make a protein called dystrophin in theirmuscles began to produce it after the injections, two teams ofresearchers report.   In humans, lack of the protein causes Duchenne musculardystrophy, the most common and severe form of the disease.   The research represents ``the most exciting approach for humantherapy that, in my opinion, has ever come along,'' said DonaldWood, director of research for the Muscular Dystrophy Association.</TEXT><DATELINE>LUBBOCK, Texas (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Blind employees at a workshop establishedto rehabilitate them say they're being exploited and are demandingthe same wages their sighted counterparts get for comparable work.
