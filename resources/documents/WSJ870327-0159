Sales dropped 11%, to $20.77 billion from $23.34 billion.    The West German chemical company attributed the sales decline to the weaker U.S. dollar and its divestiture of unprofitable operations.    Hoechst won't report 1986 net income for several weeks. It also didn't report fourth-quarter figures. But a year-to-year comparison shows that the company's pre-tax earnings in the fourth quarter climbed 13%, to $491.3 million from $436.6 million, while sales fell 7.7%, to $5.16 billion from $5.59 billion.    Meanwhile, in Luxembourg yesterday, the European Court of Justice dealt Hoechst a setback in its fight to overturn the European Community Commission's restraint-of-trade action against Hoechst and other chemical makers. The court turned down Hoechst's application for an injunction to block the commission's investigation of alleged price-fixing in two types of plastics. </TEXT></DOC>
