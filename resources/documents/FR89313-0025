L. 99-198) establisheda program whereby guaranteed loans and grants are made available to nonprofitnational corporations (NNC's) which in turn provide financial and technicalassistance to rural businesses for the improvement of business, industryand employment in rural areas. A first interim rule was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (51 FR 34926) on September 30, 1986, and invitedcomments for 30 days ending October 30, 1986. Nine comments were received.As a result of these comments and of a statute (H.J. 738_Continuing Resolution),which amended the enabling legislation, a second interim rule was publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (52 FR 25586) on July 8, 1987, and invited commentsfor 30 days ending August 7, 1987. No comments were received and the programwas subsequently implemented, although a final rule was never published.The second interim rule could be published as a final rule with minor modifications.However, the majority of the changes which are necessary if the programis to function effectively and efficiently can only be included in theinstruction by means of a proposed rule. With the advice of the Officeof General Counsel (OGC), FmHA has decided to proceed with a proposed rule.This proposed rule will reorganize and supplement the instruction for betterunderstanding by both FmHA and the public, clarify wording, correct inconsistenciesand, where applicable, delete obsolete material and update references inother program regulations. The changes will result in more efficient serviceto the public, while continuing to protect the Government's interest. A summary of the proposed major changes are as follows: (1) Subpart E of Part 1901 will be amended to reference Subpart G of Part1980 of this chapter.

Unless specifically modified by this section, the requirementsof Subpart G of Part 1940 of this chapter apply to this subpart. Althoughthe purpose of the program established by this subpart is to improve business,industry and employment in rural areas, this purpose is to be achieved,to the extent practicable, without adversely affecting important farmlandsand forest lands, prime rangelands, wetlands and floodplains. Therefore,prospective lenders, NNCs and recipients must consider the potential environmentalimpacts of their applications at the earliest planning stages and developplans and projects that minimize the potential to adversely impact theenvironment.(b) <T3>NNC applicant</T3>. As part of Form FmHA 1980-60 and when requiredby Subpart G of Part 1940 of this chapter, the NNC applicant must providea completed Form FmHA 1940-20, ``Request for Environmental Information,for each recipient for which the applicant's plan proposes financial assistance,as defined in andSection; 1980.605(c) of this subpart. FmHA will review thecomplete application and initiate a Class II environmental assessment.This assessment will focus on the potential cumulative impacts of the projectsas well as any environmental concerns or problems that are associated withindividual projects that can be identified at this time from the informationsubmitted. Because neither the completion of the Class II environmentalassessment nor the approval of the application is an FmHA commitment tothe use of funds for a specific project and because such funds can eventuallybe used in several States, no public notification requirements for a ClassII assessment will apply to the application. The affected public has notbeen sufficiently identified at this stage of the FmHA review. Should anapplication be approved, each recipient to be assisted would undergo theapplicable environmental review and public notification requirements inSubpart G of Part 1940 of this chapter prior to FmHA's consent to financialassistance for that recipient. FmHA will prepare an Environmental ImpactStatement for any application where financial assistance is a major Federalaction determined to have a significant effect on the quality of the humanenvironment. Technical assistance is considered a categorical exclusionunder FmHA's environmental review process. However, as further specifiedin Subpart G of Part 1940 of this chapter, the NNC, in the process of providingtechnical assistance, must consider the potential environmental impactsof the recommendations provided to the recipient.(c) <T3>Recipient</T3>. Once the loan guarantee has been closed and/or thegrant agreement executed, the NNC will submit to the FmHA State Office,when required by Subpart G of Part 1940 of this chapter, a properly completedForm FmHA 1940-20, executed by each recipient for which the NNC intendsto provide financial assistance as defined by andSection; 1980.605(c) ofthis subpart. The FmHA State Office will complete, for each recipient,the environmental review required by Subpart G of Part 1940 of this chapter.Appropriate notification will then be transmitted to the FmHA NationalOffice. The National Office must receive State Office clearance on theenvironmental review process before it can authorize a commitment of financialassistance to the recipient by the NNC and/or the lender.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1980.612</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Equal opportunity and nondiscrimination requirements.</ITAG>(a) The Federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibits creditors (e.g.,the lender, the NNC, and the FmHA) from discriminating against credit applicantson the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status,age and physical or mental handicap (provided that the credit applicanthas the capacity to enter into a binding contract).(b) Executive Order 11246 provides for equal employment opporunity withoutregard to race, color, religion, sex, or national origin and the eliminationof all facilities segregated on the basis of race, color, religion, ornational origin on construction work financed by FmHA involving a constructioncontract of more than $10,000. To comply with Executive Order 11246, theNNC applicant will be required to execute Form FmHA 400-1, ``Equal OpportunityAgreement,'' prior to receipt of a loan guarantee and/or grant. The recipient,as defined by andSection; 1980.605(j) of this subpart, will be required toexecute Form FmHA 400-1 prior to receipt of financial assistance, as definedby andSection; 1980.605(c) of this subpart.(c) Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 states that no person in theUnited States shall on the ground of race, color, or national origin, beexcluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjectedto discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financialassistance. In compliance with this Act, the NNC applicant will be requiredto execute Form FmHA 400-4, ``Assurance Agreement,'' prior to receipt ofa loan guarantee and/or grant. The recipient, as defined by andSection; 1980.605(j)of this subpart will be required to execute Form FmHA 400-4 prior to receiptof financial assistance, as defined by andSection; 1980.605(c) of this subpart.(d) For complete details on equal opportunity and discrimination requirements,including the conduct of compliance reviews (grant only), refer to SubpartE of Part 1901 of this chapter.<ITAG tagnum="20">(Refer to Appendix A to Subpart G_Administrative Provisions)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1980.613</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Technical assistance.</ITAG>Technical assistance, as defined by andSection; 1980.605(m) of this subpart,is a problem solving activity performed for the benefit of the recipientby the NNC and/or others (e.g. the affiliate). Grant funds may be usedto pay for the actual cost of providing a specific technical service toa recipient. Market research, product testing, financial feasibility, andmanagement development are considered examples of problem solving activities,as opposed to such activities as the acquisition of physical assets, debtrepayment, the provision of working capital, and loan closing expenses.FmHA will determine whether a specific activitiy qualifies as technicalassistance.
