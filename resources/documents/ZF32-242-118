 The sheer size of the show-1,850 exhibitors,over 1 million square feet of booth space, thousands of new products-wasoverwhelming.andM;To cover this enormous show properly, DATAMATION sent a contingent of editorsto unearth the most significant new Products for readers.andP;  The followingreport was Prepared by senior editors Paul Pinella and Mark Schlack, seniorwriter Jeff Moad, Dallas bureau manager Robert Francis,  associate editorJohn McMullen and assistant editor/new products Mike Ricciuti.andM;The Year Of The NotebookandM;COMDEX attendees expecting a parade of laptop, notebook and otherwiseportable computers certainly didn't leave the Las Vegas desert disappointed.andO;Showcased this year were improvements in overall weight, processing power,screen displays, upgradability, battery life and, not least of all, price.andM;In terms of dramatic appeal, a new generation of color liquid crystal display(LCD) screens based on Super Twist Nematic (STN) technology turned the mostheads among show goers.andP;  Toshiba America Information Systems Inc. showed offits 16-color, 80386-based T5200C laptop, and Sharp Electronics Corp. unveiledits PC8501.andP;  Both systems use an active matrix flat-panel display featuringbright, bold colors of near photographic quality.andP;  But both are slaves to theAc socket; relatively heavy (the Toshiba weighs nearly 19 pounds); andexpensive, priced at $9,000 and more.andM;Most attendees seemed equally interested in the sudden surplus oflightweight, 80386sx-based notebook machines.andP;  With Compaq Computer Corp. andTexas Instruments Inc. as their primary targets, dozens of companies rushedto COMDEX with five-to-seven-pound computers-some still not available, othersuntested by the Federal Communications Commission for possible interferencewith radio frequencies.andM;Still, there were standouts.andP;  AST Research Inc., known for its line ofupgradable desktop machines, rolled out what it says is the first upgradablenotebook PC.andP;  The 6.5-pound AST Premium Exec 286/12 can be boosted to 386sxpower by adding a $499 upgrade option.andP;  The notebook features a battery thatprovides power for three hours and a super twist LCD screen that produces ahigh-contrast, black-on-white or white-on-black VGA image.andM;Samsung Information Systems America Inc. introduced another notable notebook.andO;The 7-pound $4,499 Note-Master includes a new chip set from San JosebasedChips and Technologies Inc. that contributes to a clear VGA screen with 64shades of gray brightly lit by a sidelit fluorescent tube.andP;  One possibledrawback for power users: the Samsung is based on Intel Corp.'s slower16-megahertz microprocessor, unlike the 20MHz models from AST, GoldstarTechnology Inc. and Sharp.andP;  Among the other 16MHz 386sx introductions atCOMDEX were notebooks from Acer America Corp., Dauphin Technology Inc. andEverex Systems Inc.andM;Despite the aisles of look-alike technology, a number of companiesdemonstrated fresh approaches to PC portability.andP;  Kaypro Corp., an earlyclone maker now on the comeback trail after a brush with Chapter 11bankruptcy protection, displayed its new Micro Desktop series.andP;  Although nottrue portables, these sleek desktop units weigh in at five pounds, measureless than 10 inches wide and assume a vertical &quot;tower&quot; configuration next toa 9-inch monochrome monitor.andP;  The 386-based, 25MHz model will include a40-watt power adapter and 40-megabyte hard drive.andP;  Kaypro says the unit willbe available at the end of this month and will retail for around $ 1,000.andM;Portable PC users wondering what to do with their mouse when running Windowsprograms in cramped quarters got a glimpse at a couple of possible answers.andO;Key Tronic Corp., best known for its keyboards, but also a supplier ofnotebook computers on an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) basis,demonstrated an early working version of its new KeyMouse input device.andO;Integrated into the keyboard itself, the KeyMouse is a separate swivel keythat emulates mouse movements.andP;  Cursor movement using the COMDEX prototypewas awkward, but Key Tronic promises a smoother finished product in a fewmore months.andM;Because it's built into the keyboard, KeyMouse doesn't help users who alreadyhave portable PCs but don't have space for their mouse to roam free.andP;  Suchusers may want to investigate Appoint's MousePen Portable, a mousereplacement that looks, feels and acts like a regular ballpoint pen butcontrols the cursor just like a mouse.andP;  MousePen plugs into the standardmouse port and works on a wide range of available surfaces, like the arm of achair or a pair of jeans.andM;A World Of WindowsandM;The presence of over 200 software companies displaying Windows packages atCOMDEX is firm evidence of the broad base of support for Microsoft Corp.'sgraphical user interface.andP;  What the new Windows applications may lack ininnovation-many features are available in existing MS-DOS packages or theirMacintosh cousins-was balanced by the quantity of software vendors eager tojump on the Windows bandwagon.andM;One interesting category of windows applications is a new generation of dataanalysis tools.andP;  Channel Computing Inc. unveiled Forest andamp; Trees For Windows,an application that gives users multiple views of data included inspreadsheets and databases.andP;  Optional connections to database component ofIBM's AS/400, as well as to Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle Server and DB2, willbe provided, the company says.andM;Software Publishing Corp. showed off a Windows client version of itsInfoAlliance For OS/2, a client/server product that integrates data fromAshtonTate Corp.'s DBASE family and other leading database packages on avariety of platforms.andP;  The Windows version is slated to ship this month.andO;Additionally, Pioneer Software rolled out a new version of Q + E, a databasequery tool that works with Windows and also with OS/2 Presentation Manager.andM;Windows, not surprisingly, also proved to be a draw for new graphicspackages.andP;  Among those seen at COMDEX were CorelDRAW 2.0 For Windows fromCorel Systems Corp. Now available, CorelDRAW 2.0 adds 51 scalable typefacesto the previous release for a total of 153, and a new font editor capability.andO;New England Software Inc., makers of the popular Graph-in-the-Boxbusiness-charting package for MS-DOS, also announced a new Windows version,scheduled to ship in the first quarter.andP;  Meanwhile, Aldus Corp. demonstratedAldus Persuasion For Windows 3.0, a software package it recently ported overfrom the Macintosh.andM;A number of developer tools were evident.andP;  For instance, Asymetrix Corp.andO;introduced ToolBook For OS/2.andP;  The new version of the firm's do-it-yourselfWindows-programming kit is compatible with files created in ToolBook ForWindows.andP;  Asymetrix claims users can develop applications under oneenvironment and run them in either or both OS/2 or Windows.andM;Meanwhile, Gupta Technologies Inc. unveiled SQLWindows version 2.0, intendedfor entry-level programmers and sophisticated developers alike.andP;  The productcontains Report Windows, a graphical report designer for Windows.andP;  AndDigitalk Inc. took the wraps off Smalltalk/V Windows, rounding out its familyof object-oriented programming tools.andM;On the desktop-publishing front, Caere Corp. introduced OmniPageProfessional, which, it claims, is the first 32-bit program designed forWindows 3.0.andP;  Available now this optical character recognition packageincludes new user customization features that allow it to recognize a widerrange of symbols, such as mathematics or even Kanji.andP;  OmniPage Professionalsupports scanners from most major manufacturers, but the program requires an80386based system and 4MB of random access memory.andM;On the heels of its still new Windows version of Ventura Publisher, VenturaSoftware Inc. demonstrated Ventura Publisher For OS/2 Pm.andP;  Thedesktop-publishing software takes advantage of enhancements to IBM's OS/21.3, such as improved printer support and smaller memory requirements.andM;Makers of utility applications are in no haste to develop Windows software.andO;However, among a smattering of utilities was WinSleuth, a diagnostic programfrom Dariana Technology Group Inc. WinSleuth helps users set up andreconfigure systems to operate optimally under Windows.andM;Windows Does Networks, TooandM;Another testament to the broad support of Windows 3.0 shown at COMDEX was thenumber of products displayed that bring Windows's famed ease of use toconnectivity.andP;  Three vendors showed new versions of terminal emulationpackages designed to run in Windows, giving end users a point-and-clickinterface to bigger systems.andM;Digital Communications Associates Inc.'s IRMA Workstation For Windows isintended for use on PCs connected via coaxial cable, dial-up lines or directasynchronous connections to host systems.andP;  Simply by clicking on an icon, endusers make the connection to the host and create a session in a window.andP;  Thepackage links to IBM mainframes by emulating a 3270-type terminal, as well toDEC VAXs and other systems by emullating an asynchronous terminal.andP;  Multilplesessions governed by multiple protocols are possible.andM;Eicon Technology Corp. display a different approach to 3270 emulation.andO;Access For Windows (Access/W) works with the firm's Systems NetworkArchitecture (SNA) gateway in order to establish LAN-based micro-to-mainframecommunication.andP;  Like the IRMA Workstation, Access For Windows supportsmultiple sessions, 3287 printer emulation and a scripting language.andP;  The maindifferences between the two packages are that Eicon's does not supportasynchronous terminals but does have broader host-based graphics facilities.andM;Extra! For Windows, a communications package demonstrated by AttachmateCorp., goes one step further by adding support for gateways manufactured byIBM, something that Eicon plans to include in future versions.andP;  In addition,Extra! For Windows enables LAN connections via the company's gateway productsand IBM Token Ring interface couplers.andP;  Extra! For Windows can use either IBMor Attach-mate cards.andM;The graphical capabilities of Windows are being leveraged in a different wayby Delrina Technology Inc. The firm's WINFAX software lets users transmitfiles to fax machines.andP;  It works with any Windows 3.0 application, lettingthe user print to a fax on any machine with a faxboard built around theSierra SendFax chip set.andM;Hewlett-Packard Co.'s NewWave environment, which sits on top of Windows 3.0,gains some momentum with the release of DaVinci eMAIL NewWave.andP;  The packageadds LAN-based e-mall to the NewWave Office suite of applications.andP;  AndNewWave's object and agent facilities can be used to automate mail-relatedtasks.andP;  (See &quot;Who's Catching HP's NewWave,&quot; August 15, 1990, p. 22.)andM;COMDEX also saw the growth of products for the administration of remotenetwork sites.andP;  In recent years, software products such as pcANYWHERE IV,Carbon Copy and BLAST have been developed to enable administrators toremotely run PCs over dial-up lines.andP;  Now those capabilities are being beenextended to personal comupters connected over local area networks.andM;pcANYWHERE IV/LAN was released by Dynamic Microprocessor Associates Inc.andO;(DMA) in August 1990.andP;  At COMDEX, two other major vendors of remote controlsoftware announced LAN-based products that should be available early in 1991.andO;Microcom Inc.'s Carbon Copy will work on 1,ANs, as will BLAST, from theCommunications Research group of U.S.andP;  Robotics Inc. Using these packages,administrators can distribute software to individual PCs on remote LANs andtake control of remote consoles to troubleshoot problems.andM;The task of running a network may get easier with the coming of networkmanagement software that uses the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP),which is based on the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol(TCP/IP).andP;  David Systems Inc. showed a preliminary version of its ExpressViewNetwork Management package based on SNMP.andP;  Not only does ExpressView givemanagers a view of David's concentrators, but it gathers reports from anyconcentrator, bridge, router, workstation or other device with an SNMP agentand Management Information Base I or II.andP;  It is scheduled to ship early thisyear.andM;3Com Corp. also offers an SNMP management system, art of its Open ManagementArchitecture.andP;  The firm announced that it will resell SynOpticsCommunications Inc.'s LattisNet System 3000 manageable hub as part of theLinkBuilder family, which will include an SNMP plug-in module.andM;Micro Tempus Inc. made two announcements that may also have a significantimpact on network management.andP;  The firm's Enterprise Router lets networkmanagers interconnect LAN Manager-based LANs through an IBM mainframe runningthe MVS operating system.andP;  In a related development, Micro Tempus announcedthe porting of LAN Manager to MVS.andP;  Although a mainframe LAN operating systemmight seem paradoxical, LAN Manager/MVS lets a mainframe act as a LANfileserver and gain mainframe storage capability.andM;Of course, not all of the COMDEX networking announcements were softwarerelated.andP;  Codenoll Technology Corp. demonstrated for the first time thefruits of its partnership with General Motors Corp.'s Packard Electric group:a low-cost, easy to install implementation of Ethernet over plastic opticalfiber.andP;  Blindfolded, a Codenoll executive was able to attach a cable end toCodenoll's cleverly designed $1.95 connector in about one minute usingsimple, widely available tools.andP;  The cost per foot of cabling will start outat around 18 cents, but will drop to 10 cents with volume, Codenoll says.andM;The Gateways To COMDEXandM;Systems integrators and administrators searching for new ways to tieLAN-based PCs into broader wide-area networks were treated to a number of LANgateway introductions at COMDEX.andP;  Micro-Integration announced new softwareenabling its Bluelynx local and remote gateway cards to support IBM's As/400minicomputer so that PC users can access shared functions on the host.andO;Micro-Integration also demonstrated a multiple support feature that lets 5250gateway users add up to four gateway cards to a single PC.andM;Meanwhile, Multi-Tech Systems Inc. released its second asynchronouscommunications gateway card for NetBios-compatible LANs.andP;  The card plugs intoan IBM AT or compatible and provides LAN users with access to up to 16high-speed modems.andM;Several companies introduced hardware for local and remote access to networkfiles.andP;  MicroTest Inc. rolled out its new LANPORT-II, a network access devicethat lets remote users log onto Novell LANs via a modem.andP;  The Netport-II canfunction as a gateway, letting users take control of a network PC from aremote site.andM;Also plainly evident at COMDEX were products that enable users of portablePCs to access and control LANs from afar.andP;  Xircom Inc., a companyspecializing in pocket Ethernet adapters for portables, rolled out driversfor the Network Driver Interface Specification (NDIS), DECnet/PCSA and anupdated Packet Driver.andP;  The Packet Driver adds support for additional TCP/IPsoftware.andM;Those worried about inadvertently violating their LAN software licensingagreements can breathe easier now that Rainbow Technologies Inc. hasintroduced NetSentinel.andP;  This hardware and software system controls thenumber of users accessing LAN-based applications.andP;  The NetSentinel can beinstalled inside each PC on a LAN and keeps track of the number of usersaccessing applications software.andP;  It then denies access when the limits of asite license are reached.andM;While the NetSentinel limits LAN user access, the LASERNET Multi-Link extendsa LAN's support over a wide range of peripherals.andP;  Western Telematic Inc.andO;says the product can connect up to 32 devices to a LAN for printer,peripheral and file sharing.andP;  The Multi-Link includes eight serial and fourparallel ports that can be configured to share printers, fax machines,plotters or modems.andM;A Phalanx Of File ServersandM;If notebooks, laptops and Windows applications overshadowed the number of486-based servers and multiprocessor machines introduced at COMDEX, it wasn'tby much.andP;  Grid Systems Corp. introduced its first network server, the Grid486ei-25/SVR.andP;  Previously' Grid customers had used other Gridhigh-performance machines as network servers, but this is Grid's firstmachine geared specifically for the network market.andM;IBM was also pushing its new PS/2 models 90 and 95, both of which are-basedon Intel's 486 microprocessor.andP;  Big Blue demonstrated a network of PS/2ssharing the processing of a database application in a fault-tolerantconfiguration, part of a suite of applications meant to position a network ofPS/2s based on Micro Channel-Architecture as an alternative to multiprocessormachines such as Compaq's SystemPRO server.andM;Compaq broke precedent and showed an unannounced, unshipped product: a 20GBstorage device for the SystemPRO.andP;  Although Compaq didn't announce when theproduct would be released, the company said it expects the product to be outby the middle  of 1991.andP;  Compaq hopes that high-end products like this willdifferentiate the company from the plethora of vendors offering a wide arrayof multiprocessor servers.andM;Among the vendors offering this new class of server was Advanced LogicResearch Inc., which showed its ALR MultiAccess.andP;  This machine can handle upto six 33MHz Intel 486 or 386 microprocessors running the SCO MPX operatingsystem.andM;Coming even closer to challenging Compaq, ALR also announced a&quot;SystemPRO-compatible&quot; dual-processor machine dubbed the Powerpro.andP;  It runssome of the same software used by the Compaq server, including Microsoft LANManager and Novell NetWare.andP;  It's slated to be shipped in the first quarterof this year.andM;Low-priced 486-based servers were also in evidence from manufacturers such asDell Computer Corp., offering up the $8,949 Dell System 425TE.andP;  While manymanufacturers are now selling these servers to a ready and willing market,the degree to which the distribution arm of the industry-the OEM andvalue-added reseller channels-can support them adequately remains open todebate.andM;COMDEX Makes SPARCs FlyandM;While COMDEX-goers were basking in the glow of new 486-based PCs, a new waveof UNIX workstations was also hitting the beach.andP;  These machines are theoutgrowth of market leader Sun Microsystems Inc.'s efforts to promote aPC-like binary standard for workstations by licensing its SPARC reducedinstruction set computing CPU.andP;  The new workstations emphasize low cost andsupport for standards such as Sun's SBus, SunOS and the Network File System.andM;The first group of clones from vendors including CompuAdd Corp., TatungScience andamp; Technology Inc., Toshiba and TriGem Corp. typically are being builtaround versions of the SPARC I chip set and fabricated by second sources suchas Fujitsu Ltd. and LSI Logic Corp. Typical systems-such as Tatung's, whichships with 8MB of memory, a 20-inch monitor, a hard disk and operatingsystem-list for about $7,000.andP;  CompuAdd is selling a diskless version of itsandM;SPARC clone pioneer Solbourne Computer Inc. added to its line of high-endUNIX workstations, introducing its new S4000 model.andP;  Based on a custom 64-bitversion of the SPARC CPU, a proprietary 64-bit internal system bus and up to104MB of internal memory, the S4000 has an entry price of $9,000 and isclocked at 25.5 million instructions per second.andM;UNIX workstation vendors also joined the portable computer craze.andP;  One of themore interesting announcements was by Korean vendor TriGem, which showed aSPARC-based portable that the company says will run SunOS, MS-DOS andMacintosh applications.andP;  TriGem, which developed its SLT-100 and SLT-200portables with privately held Research, Development andamp; Innovations Inc., saysthe systems were scheduled to ship this month at prices from $7,000 for adiskless version to $20,000 for a 25MHz color version.andP;  TriGem officials saythey had given details of their Macos emulation plans to Apple Computer Inc.andO;over a year ago.andP;  So far, Apple has not objected, TriGem said.andM;Toshiba also showed a portable SPARC system that will ship later this summer.andO;The 20MHz SPARC, LT includes a Japanese/English version of SunOS and willlist for $15,000 in an 8MB configuration.andM;Storage Gets Bigger, Faster, CheaperandM;There were strong indications at COMDEX that optical devices may be movingcloser to price and performance levels that will lead to broader commercialacceptance.andP;  Two vendors-Mass Optical Storage Technologies Inc. (MOST) andPinnacle Micro Inc.-showed relatively fast 3/,2-inch rewritable drives with128MB capacities, which vendors say will become a standard among opticaldrives.andP;  Like the MOST device, the Pinnacle Micro rewritable drive combinesmagnetic and optical storage technologies to achieve the ability to rewrite.andM;Although the devices use the Small Computer Systems Interface (SCSI) standardand have fast access times-in the 28-millisecond range, on average-they comewith one inherent disadvantage: their magneto-optic designs require two headpasses to rewrite,-one to erase existing data and another to write.andP;  Bothdevices list for about $3,000, and each media cartridge is priced at $130.andM;Another vendor, Panasonic Communications andamp; Systems Co., announced rewritableoptical drives that avoid the double-pass disadvantage.andP;  Although sporting aslower average access time of 90msecs, the Panasonic LF-7010 optical driveuses a phase-change optical technique to deliver rewritable function whileavoiding multiple head passes to write.andP;  The 574-inch drive, which is nowavailable, has the added advantage of being able to read and write to bothwrite-once and rewritable media.andP;  The Panasonic device stores up to 1GB ofdata and is priced at $4,000.andP;  Reflection Systems Inc. is incorporating thePanasonic chive into an MS-DOS, Macintosh and OS/2-compatible subsystempriced at $4,000.andM;Disk array devices were shown by Advanced Logic, Core International, Dell andMicropolis Corp. The Micropolis array, perhaps the most advanced of the lot,is a Level 5 device incorporating from three to 28 5 74-inch drives, over 2GBof storage and software that spreads parity bits throughout the array.andO;Micropolis will ship the array, code-named RAID, in the second quarter ofthis year.andM;Two start-up companies previewed a couple of new PC storage technologies.andO;Insite Peripherals Inc. says it will begin shipping in the second quarter ofthis year a new generation of floppy disk drives capable of storing 21MB ofdata.andP;  Insite's so-called Floptical 3 72-inch drives combine magneticrecording and optical servo tracking to achieve the high densities.andM;Another start-up,SunDisk Corp., early this year will introduce removablecredit-card-sized memory devices that use Intel Flash Memory chips to deliverstorage in 5 and 10MB increments.andP;  The cards, which will be used primarilywith portable PCS, will initially be priced at about $250 per- megabyte.andM;Meanwhile, two other vendors showed new data compression products for userslooking for ways to expand storage capacity without replacing existing diskdrives.andP;  Stac Electronics exhibited a new software version of its Stackerdata compression product for portable PCs.andP;  The software is said to deliverreal-time data compression ratios of two to one on portables with hard disks.andO;And InfoChip Systems Inc. showed its Expanz! compression card for PC XTs, ATsand compatibles.andP;  InfoChip says the half-card running under MS-DOS 3.Xdelivers three to one compression rates in real time and can be used withhard disks, floppies, tape drives or magneto-optical devices.andM;Portable Products MentionedandM;AppointandM;Paso Robles, Calif.andM;MousePen PortableandM;Mouselike pointing deviceandM;Price: $149andM;AST Resarch Inc.andM;irvine, Calif.andM;AST Premium Exec 386SX/20andM;386SX notebook computerandM;Price: $2,895andM;Kaypro Corp.andM;San DiegoandM;Micro Desktop MD-30andM;Compact personal computerandM;Price: N/AandM;Key Tronic Corp.andM;Spokane, Wash.andM;KeyMouseandM;Mouselike pointing deviceandM;Price: N/AandM;Samsung InformationandM;Systems America Inc.andM;San JoseandM;NoteMaster 386S/16andM;386SX notebook computerandM;Price: $4,499andM;Sharp Electronics Corp.andM;Mahwah, N.J.andM;PC8501andM;Color laptop computerandM;Price: Between $10,000 andandM;$15,000andM;Toshiba America informationandM;Systems Inc.andM;Irvine, Calif.andM;T5200CandM;Color laptop computerandM;Price: $9,499andM;Windows 3.0 Products MentionedandM;Aldus Corp.andM;SeattleandM;Aldus Persuasion For Windows 3.0.andM;Desktop presentation applicationandM;Price: N/AandM;Asymetrix Corp.andM;Bellevue, Wash.andM;ToolBook For OS/2andM;Applications development toolandM;Price:$395andM;Caere Corp.andM;Los Gatos, Calif.andM;OmniPage Professional ForandM;Windows 3.0andM;Optical character recognitionandM;softwareandM;Price:$995andM;Channel Computing Inc.andM;Newmarket, N.H.andM;Forest andamp; Trees For WindowsandM;Database and spreadsheet viewerandM;Price: $495andM;Corel Systems Corp.andM;OttawaandM;CorelDRAW 2.0 For WindowsandM;Drawing softwareandM;Price: $695andM;Dariana Technology Group Inc.andM;Buena Park, Calif.andM;WinSleuthandM;Windows utilityandM;Price: $149andM;Digitalk Inc.andM;Los AngelesandM;Smalltalk/V WindowsandM;Object-oriented programmingandM;languageandM;Price:  99.95andM;Gupta Technologies Inc.andM;Menlo Park, Calif.andM;SQLWindows version 2.0andM;Database access tootandM;Price: N/AandM;New England Software Inc.andM;Greenwich, Conn.andM;Graph-in-the-Box WINDOWSandM;Business-charting andandM;presentation packageandM;Price:$495andM;Pioneer SoftwareandM;Raleigh, N.C.andM;Q+E For Windows And OS/2 PMandM;Spreadsheet/databaseandM;connectivity utilityandM;Price: $149andM;Software Publishing Corp.andM;Mountain View, Calif.andM;infoAlliance For WindowsandM;Database integratorandM;Price: N/AandM;Ventura Software Inc.andM;San DiegoandM;Ventura Publisher For OS/2 PMandM;Desktop-publishing packageandM;Price: $895andM;Networking Products MentionedandM;Attachmate Corp.andM;Bellevue, Wash.andM;Extra!
