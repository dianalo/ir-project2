LEDERER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MANCHESTER, England (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   For nearly two years, Viraj Mendis hasnot stepped outside an Anglican church in Manchester. To do so, hesays, means he will be deported to his native Sri Lanka and certaindeath.   He sleeps in the minister's tiny robing room and dreams ofwalking in a park, but he stays in the church because he believesthe British government won't send police in to arrest him _ eventhough they can legally pick him up at any time.   The 32-year-old political activist chose the ancient right ofsanctuary as a last resort in his fight to keep from being sent backto Sri Lanka, the island nation formerly called Ceylon off India'ssouthern tip.   His case has become a test for the revival of the sanctuarymovement in Britain.   ``If I'm allowed to win, it would be seen as a big victory forsanctuary in this country and that will open up the doors,'' Mendissaid.   Mendis predicted hundreds of illegal immigrants will take refugein churches and mosques if he succeeds, especially since appealsagainst deportation have been severely restricted in a newimmigration law.   Mendis has lost two immigration appeals, a High Court judicialreview and a Court of Appeal ruling. He is waiting to see whetherParliament's House of Lords, Britain's highest court, will hear hiscase.   Mendis took refuge in the Church of the Ascension in Manchester'srundown, mainly black, Hulme district Dec. 20, 1986, two days afterHome Secretary Douglas Hurd, who is in charge of immigration, signeda deportation order against him for ``overstaying'' in Britain.   The tall, bearded and bespectacled Mendis, son of a Sri Lankantea plantation manager, came to Britain in 1973 on a student visa tostudy electrical engineering at the University of Manchester.   He finished two years and had a visa until 1975. He said he gotinto financial difficulties, dropped out of school and went to work.He added that he became so disenchanted with the treatment of blacksthat he joined a communist splinter group.   A member of Sri Lanka's Sinhalese majority, Mendis said he wasappalled by what he considered racism in his own country against theminority Tamils and after severe rioting in his homeland in 1983, heparticipated in several pro-Tamil demonstrations in England.   ``At that stage I knew if I go back to Sri Lanka now, I've had itbecause Sinhalese people who support the Tamils are consideredtraitors,'' he said.   But the Home Office and the courts have ruled that his fear ofpersecution is not well-founded, a contention supported by the SriLankan High Commission, which said he ``is free to go to Sri Lankawithout impediment.''   However, the human rights organization Amnesty International aswell as church and refugee groups and a recent independent publicinquiry have supported Mendis, saying he could face persecution,especially from Sinhalese extremists.   ``There is clear evidence that people who have been deported fromBritain to Sri Lanka during the past year have suffered torture,''said David Haslam of he British Council of Churches race relationsunit.   The Rev. John Methuen, rector of the Hulme district, said hisChurch of the Ascension decided to offer Mendis sanctuary because``we believe we are trying to save a man's life.'' He said thecongregation wasn't concerned that Mendis is an atheist.   Mendis and his supporters, who maintain a 24-hour guard at thechurch, have been targets of hate mail and threatening phone calls.The church had a bomb scare. One supporter was stabbed in the backof the neck. Another was followed home and had a swastika carved onthe top of her hand with a razor blade.   Mendis said the real reason the British government wants todeport him is that ``they don't want any more black people in thiscountry. ... That's really at the heart of it, and to make it worse,I'm not only a black person, I'm a communist as well.''   The Home Office refused to comment on the case saying SecretaryHurd ``is content to abide by the decision of the court in thismatter and we would hope that Mr. Mendis would do the same.''   But Mendis said he won't leave the church unless the deportationorder is lifted. He sleeps on a sofa bed in the robing room and eatsmeals provided by members of the community.   The right of sanctuary was an accepted part of British common lawuntil 1623 when it was abolished by Parliament, but the tradition ofsanctuary in a church has held.   Methuen said he doesn't believe Hurd ``wants to go down inhistory'' as the first home secretary to send police into a church.The clergyman maintained Hurd has other options, such as lifting thedeportation order to allow further investigation.   Mendis believes that his support in the local community and fearsthat his arrest could spark riots have so far kept police away. Buthe said the Home Office may move against him soon because ``theywant to destroy the sanctuary movement.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Fri AMs, Nov. 11</NOTE></DOC>
