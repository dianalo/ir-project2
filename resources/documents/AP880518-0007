TATRO</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Five months of Palestinian strikes and boycottshave cost Israel $500 million in lost tourist income, uncollectedtaxes and added military expenses, officials say.   But Israeli analysts suggest the 1.5 million Arab residents ofthe West Bank and Gaza Strip have suffered even more because theydepend on Israel for jobs and services.   Gad Yaacobi, minister of economy, estimated the loss between$500 million to $560 million, according to his spokeswoman, NaamaHenig.   Riots, stay-at-home strikes, refusal to pay taxes and a boycottof Israeli products have left their greatest mark on tourism, whichbrought in $1.6 billion last year.   ``The major damage is to the tourism industry. The estimate isthere will be a drop of several hundred million dollars in incomedue to the image of Israel as a result of the uprising,'' saidAssaf Razin, professor of economy at Tel Aviv University.   Tourism in March and April was down 23 percent from the firsttwo months of the year, and advance bookings have fallen. This is ahuge disappointment for officials who had hoped to reap a touristbonanza on Israel's 40th anniversary.   To counter its bad image, Israel will spend $5 million on anadvertising campaign under the slogan ``Israel: See for Yourself.''   ``The idea is Israel isn't just the West Bank, it's Masada,Eilat, Jaffa oranges, all these wonderful things,'' said AlLieberman, president of New York-based Grey Advertising, one of thecompanies involved in the campaign.   Half the total cost has been putting additional manpower in thefield to handle the riots.   The ceiling on reserve army duty was raised from 45 to 62 daysper year. Razin said the government will have to pay $100 millionto reserve soldiers, who are compensated for missing work.   Yaacobi said the army spent $250 million for riot control, andthe police $94 million. He indicated this could weaken Israel'sdefense posture.   ``It is clear that we will not be able to absorb for long sumsof hundreds of millions of shekels without this badly damaging thereadiness of both the forces,'' Yaacobi said on army radio.   Razin said the uprising that began Dec. 8, known as the``intefadeh,'' has not had the same economic impact as Israel'sthree-year Lebanon occupation, which cost $1.6 billion to $2billion and fueled runaway inflation of more than 400 percent.   ``The economic aspects of the intefadeh have not been thatdevastating or costly enough visibly to change Israeli attitudes,''Razin said in an interview.   Eitan Berglas, chairman of the Bank Hapoalim, which isaffiliated with Israel's labor movement, said the loss to Israel'seconomy this year would be be 1.5 percent to 2 percent of the grossnational product of $25 billion.   Berglas said the rising costs of governing the occupied WestBank and Gaza Strip could affect Israeli thinking about the need tokeep the land seized in the 1967 Middle East war.   ``If Israelis are persuaded there will be no return to thesituation as it was before the uprising and if big expenditurescontinue, it may convince people of the need to compromise aboutthe territories,'' he said.   But Berglas said the question was whether the economic burdenwould have an impact before November when national elections arescheduled.   In recent years, Israel has been profiting financially fromtrade with the occupied territories. In 1987, the surplus was $491million.   Also declining are tax collections that fund the army-run CivilAdministration, which governs the West Bank and Gaza Strip.   ``It's starting to be significant. We have a shortage ofmoney,'' said a senior official in the Civil Administration whichruns schools, hospitals and utilities in the occupied lands.   ``We are trying to protect the most vital services, such ashospitals, but a shortage of money means a shortage of service,''said the official, who demanded anonymity.   To collect taxes, which fund the Civil Administration's $320million budget, the army has set up surprise checkpoints on thehighways in the West Bank and Gaza.   Soldiers use portable computers to check whether motorists havepaid taxes. Palestinian journalists say some cars, trucks and cargohave been seized if taxes have not been paid.   An army economist in the Civil Administration predicted the $1.4billion GNP of the West Bank and Gaza Strip would decline by asmuch as $100 million if the unrest continued. Razin predicted theloss could be several hundred million.   ``In terms of relative magnitude, there's a very big impact inthe territories while on the Israeli side it is manageable,'' saidRazin.   The greatest impact has been on the 110,000 Arabs laborers whohold jobs in Israel. About 20 percent have been kept off the joband others have lost income because of PLO-called general strikesor army-imposed curfews.   ``The fact is the Palestinian worker needs Israel more thanIsrael needs him,'' said the army economist, who demanded anonymity.</TEXT></DOC>
