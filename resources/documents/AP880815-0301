Boesky beginning in 1984,according to a published report Monday.   The previously unknown financial tie raises questions ofpotential conflicts of interest for Milken and Drexel, according tolawyers and Wall Street executives interviewed by the Wall StreetJournal.   From 1984 to 1986, when the Drexel employee group held a stakein Boesky's operation, Boesky was Wall Street's most powerfultakeover speculator and traded in many stocks about which Drexelhad valuable inside information.   A spokesman for Drexel said the Drexel employees were onlypassive investors with no role in the operations Boesky's firm.   The Journal said the tie was revealed in public documents filedin Washington, D.C., and California; private offering documents;and people familiar with the relationship.   Boesky was sentenced to three years in prison last December on acriminal charge stemming from the government's investigation intowrongdoing on Wall Street. He previously agreed to pay a $100million penalty to settle a civil complaint of insider trading andwas banished from the securities business.   The Securities and Exchange Commission approved civil charges ofsecurities-law violations against Drexel, Milken and three otherDrexel employees, but so far the charges have not been filed.   The charges are based largely on allegations of illegal dealingsbetween Boesky and Drexel, the Journal said, citing people familiarwith the investigation.   The Journal said people close to Drexel say the Drexelemployees, through a general partnership known as Camro Associates,invested $1 million in the Boesky firm, Seemala Corp., in 1984, andreceived $3 million for their stake in 1986.   Camro was made up largely of employees of Drexel's junk bondoperations in Beverly Hills, Calif., the Journal said.   A Drexel spokesman, Steven Anreder, told the Journal, ``Theinvestment was made over four years ago with the full knowledge andconsent of'' Drexel. ``It was fully disclosed and the amountinvolved was only 1 percent of the equity (of Seemala) based onbook value.''   Anreder described the investment as ``strictly passive,''meaning the Drexel investors were not involved in the business ofSeemala. He said Monday that Fried Frank Harris Shriver andamp; Jacobson,a law firm working for Seemala, proposed the investment for taxreasons.   Leon Silverman, a lawyer for Boesky, declined comment Monday.   After the Drexel employee group sold its stake in Boesky'sarbitrage firm in 1986, Drexel took its own stake in Boesky'ssuccessor firm. Drexel sold $660 million in notes as part ofBoesky's effort to raise $1 billion in debt and equity for his newfirm, received $24 million in investment banking fees, and invested$5 million in the new firm.</TEXT></DOC>
