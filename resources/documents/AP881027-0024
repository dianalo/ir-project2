The National Security Political Action Committee said Wednesdayits ad will run 2,400 times Nov. 1-7 on cable stations in Floridaand Ohio. The production and time buys cost $100,000.   The spot lists five weapons systems it said Dukakis opposes andsays ``a Dukakis group calls for a $75 billion cut in defense,'' areference to the Boston-based Jobs with Peace Campaign on whoseboard Dukakis serves.   ``As former chairman of the Joint Chiefs, I know that such cutswill cripple our country,'' retired Adm. Thomas H. Moorer says inthe ad. ``We cannot afford to have Dukakis sitting across fromGorbachev. We must support George Bush for president. It's a matterof national security.''   The pro-Bush group has spent $2.5 million on ads supporting theRepublican, including earlier ones running under the name Americansfor Bush. Bush campaign officials have filed complaints against thegroup and disavowed its activities.   A new ad accusing Dukakis of raiding his state's pension fund,which began airing Tuesday night in spot markets around the country,drew protests from both the Dukakis campaign and The Wall StreetJournal.   The ad says Dukakis ``deliberately misled'' 62 million Americansin the last debate by denying the raiding charge and calls him``unbelievable.''   The spot features a debate clip and a quote from the Journal that``it is indisputable that $27 million moved out of the nation's mostunderfunded state pension system, so that the governor could claimto have balanced the fiscal 1988 budget.''   Albert Hunt, Washington bureau chief for the Journal, said thenewspaper is protesting the ad to the Bush campaign becauses itcreates the impression that the quotes came from the front page whenin fact they came from the opinion pages.   The Dukakis campaign said the incident in question was ``abudgetary transfer'' of an unanticipated surplus and had no effecton the level of pension benefits or the security of the system.   Also on the ad front, the National Rifle Association said it issuing the Dukakis campaign to stop threats of legal action againstradio stations airing ads attacking the Democrat's stands on guncontrol and crime. The ads are running in more than 20 states.   The NRA is seeking a judicial declaration that the Dukakiscampaign's threats of legal action are baseless and the FirstAmendment would protect radio stations against any liability iflegal action were taken. The lawsuit also seeks an injunction tostop further threats of libel suits against the radio stations.   Dukakis' general counsel, Daniel Taylor, has told the NRA it isdistorting Dukakis' positions and wrongly attributing statements tohim. Dukakis campaign officials in several states have told radiostations to stop running the ads.</TEXT></DOC>
