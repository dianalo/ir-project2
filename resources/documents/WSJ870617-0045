The case -- outlined in a 145-count indictment unsealed in federal court in Brooklyn yesterday -- is the largest such criminal pension-fund scheme the Justice Department has prosecuted, the government said.    U.S. Attorney Andrew J. Maloney said the indictment constitutes &quot;part of the evidence&quot; of alleged local Teamsters corruption that could be included in the department's anticipated civil lawsuit to take over the entire union.    Accused in the alleged scheme, which the government said yielded $22 million in illegal profits, were Martin J. Schwimmer, 43 years old, of Kings Point, N.Y., a registered investment adviser, author of several business books and a college professor; and Mario Renda, 46, of Garden City, N.Y., owner of First United Financial Corp., a Garden City investment firm.    The two men brokered the investment of more than $100 million from the benefit plans of Teamsters Local 810 and Local 38 of the Sheet Metal Workers union, AFL-CIO, from 1981 to 1984, the government said.    Only Mr. Renda was charged with embezzlement, for allegedly stealing $4,068 from Local 810. Mr. Schwimmer was also charged with obstruction of justice.    If convicted, each man faces a maximum 38 years in prison and $1.3 million in fines. The government is also seeking the forfeiture of the $22 million in alleged illegal profits, as well as Mr. Renda's 100% interest in First United.    Mr. Schwimmer had no comment on the indictment, said a woman who answered his telephone late yesterday, but didn't identify herself. Mr. Renda's attorney, Ronald G. Russo, said the indictment was &quot;totally baseless.&quot;    &quot;This is something I've been discussing with the government for three years now,&quot; said Mr. Russo. &quot;My client's activities have always been totally honest and aboveboard. He's a businessman who conducted himself in a thoroughly legitimate fashion.&quot;    A spokesman for the Teamsters union wasn't immediately available for comment.    Edward A. McDonald, chief of the Justice Department's Organized Crime Strike Force in Brooklyn, said the racketeering activity described in the indictment had &quot;contributed&quot; to the collapse of several cash-starved banks and thrifts.    There's &quot;no question&quot; that $14 million in &quot;exorbitant&quot; commission payments allegedly made to the two men contributed to the demise of such institutions as Old Court Savings andamp; Loan Association, Mr. McDonald said. The Baltimore-based thrift collapsed in May 1985, touching off a Maryland banking crisis.    Neither the two unions nor any banking officials were named in the indictment.    The indictment charged that the two defendants used off-the-books accounts to pay kickbacks &quot;to officials of Local 810 and its affiliated employee benefit plans.&quot; Officials of the Sheet Metal Workers weren't accused of such activity.    A separate indictment unsealed yesterday in federal court in Kansas City, Kan., charged Mr. Renda and four others with conspiring to defraud Indian Springs State Bank and Coronado Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association of more than $7 million in unsecured real estate loans.    The government said the two institutions were &quot;enabled&quot; to make the loans because of brokered funds received from First United.    The Brooklyn indictment follows the plea of Joseph DeCarlo Sr., First United's executive vice president, to related conspiracy and tax charges June 6. Mr. DeCarlo is cooperating with the government.    Prosecutors said First United, through its First United Fund Ltd. unit, was during the time of the alleged scheme one of the country's leading brokers of certificates of deposit, brokering $5 billion of CDs in 1983 alone. </TEXT></DOC>
