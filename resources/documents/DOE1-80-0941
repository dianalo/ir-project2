Distribution ofdiagenetic alterations in ore-bearing sandstones of the Westwater CanyonMember suggests that these alterations were strongly influenced by porewaters expelled from fine-grained units in the overlying Brushy BasinMember. A moderately high pH created by hydrolysis and dissolution ofvolcanic ash enabled these fluids to dissolve and mobilize humate inlower Brushy Basin and upper Westwater Canyon sediments. When these fluidsmixed with connate water in sandstones of the middle to lower parts ofthe Westwater Canyon Member, tabular uranium orebodies were formed. Astrong diagenetic overprint related to Laramide tectonism and late Tertiaryoxidation obscured early alteration patterns and resulted in the localredistribution of primary uranium ore and dissolution of previously formedauthigenic cements. Similarities between ore mineralogy and postdepositionalalterations in the Morrison Foramtion of the Grants uranium region andin the Morrison of the northern part of the Colorado Plateau suggestthat these ore deposits have a common genesis. The apparent replacementof the organic matrix in the Grants region by chlorite and locally bya chlorite-coffinite mixture in ore zones suggests that, where a chlorite-dominatedassemblage is not present, carbonaceous uranium ore once existed. Thisobservation leads to the hypothesis that the organic-carbon-rich, locallychlorite-bearing Grants uranium ore and the organic-carbon-poor, chlorite-richore of the northern Colorado Plateau are end members of the same mineralizationprocess.</TEXT></DOC>
