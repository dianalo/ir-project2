(products).andO;Ticker:    DEC.andO;Product:   DECdecision (computer program) (design and construction).andO;Topic:     Integrated SoftwareSoftware DesignData Base Management SystemsSpreadsheetsMacrosDecision Support SystemsMinicomputers.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>DIGITAL EQUIPMENT Corporation is taking a three-step approach to make itsvision of a unified software environment a reality.andP;  At the architecturallevel, the company is implementing a comprehensive set of network-wideservices as part of its Network Application Support (NAS) strategy.andP;  Digitalhas come a long way over the past 18 months, introducing 12 NAS services todate.andP;  We expect more to come in the future, such as document management anda much-needed filing cabinet.andM;The company's second step is to introduce applications that are not onlystate-of-the-art but also demonstrate what can be done with the underlyingarchitecture and services.andP;  The emphasis is on network-based, distributedapplications.andP;  DECwrite and DECdecision are sample applications embodyingboth CDA Services and Application Control Services.andP;  We covered DECwrite inlast month's issue.andP;  This month, we are giving you an in-depth look atDECdecision as well as our general conclusions on Digital's new strategy andproducts.andM;The third step in Digital's strategy, which is yet to come, is theintroduction of integrated packages that incorporate these new applicationsbased on NAS services.andP;  We look forward to the implementation of All-In-1Phase II and to seeing how closely reality matches the vision.andM;DECdecisionandM;DECdecision is an end-user decision support environment with three integratedcomponents plus a cross-component macro facility.andP;  Access is the databasecomponent, providing access to and manipulation of Rdb and other databasetables.andP;  Calc is the spreadsheet processor.andP;  DECchart creates graphics fromboth Access tables and Calc spreadsheets.andP;  Builder, the cross-component macrofacility, allows the user to connect macros created in each of the othermodules into an automated procedure.andM;Like DECwrite, DECdecision is both DECwindows- and CDA-compliant.andO;DECdecision stores its data in DTIF, which, like DDIF, is part of CDA.andP;  DTIFhandles data in specific contexts, such as preserving spreadsheet formulasand database data types for interchange purposes.andP;  If you copy or move datathat you entered as a number and formatted as money, it will retain theformatting attributes when you paste it.andP;  And, as we described above,DECwrite can live-link to data created by any of the four DECdecisionmodules.andM;As we stated last month, both DECwrite and DECdecision use the NASApplication Control Services (ACS) when linking among applications and data.andO;While DECdecision doesn't actively notify you if linked data has changed (asdoes DECwritc), DECdecision uses ACS at several levels.andP;  The main DECdecisionmenu uses ACS to invoke the DECdecision components; Builder accesses ACS whencalling up another DECdecision component; and Access and Calc use ACS toinvoke DECchart with the &quot;draw chart&quot; command.andM;GOALS.andP;  DECdecision shows that Digital has spent a great deal of time andeffort to optimize the typical trade-offs that are made in any decisionsupport product: providing ease of use with a high level of analyticalcapability, and offering the user an easy development tool while maintainingflexibility.andP;  Thus, the product is targeted at all types of end users, fromdata-dependent professionals through secretaries and administrators.andP;  Forexperienced power users, DECdecision offers the use of a command line andmenu bypass.andM;An application in DECdecision typically will be created and maintained by oneperson for use by one or a small number of users (i.e., a personal orworkgroup application).andP;  It is not targeted at complex applications developedand maintained for use by many users across an organization.andP;  It is thedifference between recording and customizing macros over time and writingprograms to generate and maintain a database application, for example.andM;DECdecision will be an international product, with translations into at least11 languages planned.andP;  These versions will go beyond mere menu translationsto include date formats, collating sequences, etc.andM;Platforms.andP;  Initially, DECdecision is only available on VMS, since Rdb, theunderlying DBMS for Access, does not run on Ultrix yet.andP;  A user with aDECwindows Ultrix workstation, however, could run DECdecision remotely on aVAX in a window on the screen.andP;  A high priority for the company is to runDECdecision on Ultrix.andP;  Once the relationship with Ingres and RelationalTechnology is worked out, we expect DECdecision to be one of the firstproducts to migrate to Ultrix.andP;  DECdecision already uses some components ofNAS SQL Services (announced last month) for database access, and willimplement it fully in future releases.andM;A DECdecision license costs $1,000 per user, with a volume discount of 20percent (5-9 licenses) up to 45 percent (50+ licenses).andM;USING DECDECISION.andP;  You can customize your DECdecision working environmentand set your preferences (default settings) for each component from the mainmenu, called the control panel.andP;  At startup, you can have up to five windows(data table, spreadsheet, or Chart) opened automatically; have Builder open;and have any component open as an icon.andP;  You can further customize yourenvironment from within each component.andM;As with any DECwindows-compliant application, you move data within and amongcomponents using the clipboard or quick copy.andP;  You can import and export bothlocal and remote data stored in several common formats, including datacreated in other products such as DECcalc and Lotus 1-2-3.andM;Documentation.andP;  Each component has a separate User's Guide, and there is anoverview document as well.andP;  Each component comes with sample data, and theoverview includes a cross component tutorial.andM;ACCESS.andP;  The database module is layered on top of Rdb, providing aneasy-to-use window into a relational DBMS (RDBMS).andP;  It offers access to Rdbdatabases, RMS and DBMS tables and Datatrieve domains through Datatrieve(these are read only tables), IDMS/R and DB2 databases on IBM systems viaVIDA, and DECdecision data.andP;  You do not have to know how to use these otherproducts in order to access the data, only how to use DECdecision Access.andO;You can access existing databases or create your own personal/shareddatabases.andP;  The data can be either local or remote.andP;  Any table you create isstored in Rdb and can be defined as private or public (with read only orupdate access).andM;To access a database table that you don't own, you first define a reference.andO;This identifies all of the gruesome pathname information to tell Access howto locate the table.andP;  However, this is a one-time-only requirement; you canthen refer to the table by whatever friendly name you have assigned.andP;  Thistask can also be done by a system administrator for the user or for groups ofusers.andP;  All security applies, and, if the database is read only, certain menuoptions will be grayed and unaccessible to a user viewing data from thedatabase.andP;  However, you can extract read-only data to a local database fromwhich you can manipulate the data.andP;  You can also make a private tableavailable to the public by &quot;publishing&quot; it and storing it in a public folder.andM;There is no data dictionary interface available yet in Access.andP;  This wouldgive the user the ability to browse through the available database table andfield definitions to locate data of interest.andP;  This is a high priority forDigital, and we expect to see a full data dictionary interface to Common DataDictionary/Plus (CDD/Plus) in the future.andM;Tables are displayed in a spreadsheet-type format, with each row representinga record, and each column, a field.andP;  Access does not have a feature fordesigning custom forms in which to view records one at a time or to seerelated data from two tables in a master-detail format.andP;  Access is intendedsimply as an easy-to-use, ad hoc interface to data.andM;Filing System.andP;  Based in part on VAX Teamdata, Access has inheritedTeamdata's filing system.andP;  The user has folders, which can be public orprivate, and subfolders within which to store and organize information.andO;Deleted tables are moved to a Wastebasket folder.andP;  They can be moved back toanother folder or permanently deleted.andM;Creating Tables.andP;  It is very easy to create a new table using the Accessmenus.andP;  You choose a data type, a field and display length, and justification(left, center, right) for each column.andP;  You also can select formattingoptions for the column depending on the data type.andP;  User-defined custom editstrings and computed columns are supported as well.andM;You can insert columns in an existing table.andP;  If you decide after makingchanges to a table that you don't want to keep the changes, you can use&quot;revert&quot; to restore the table to the original view when you opened it.andM;Data Manipulation.andP;  An Access table can be joined to another table and sortedon unlimited levels in either ascending or descending order.andP;  You can performaggregate calculations such as count, total, average, minimum, and maximum.andO;You can change the data type, alignment, display width, or column name of acolumn.andM;Queries.andP;  Access has several options for queries: show fewer, more, all,none, and unique.andP;  We found the model a little confusing until we understoodthe focus of the query processor.andP;  You are always working with the currentcollection shown on the screen.andP;  Thus, if you execute a &quot;show fewer&quot; query ona table of all employees to see only those within a specific department, thelist of employees in that department is now the focus for the next query.andM;At this point, to add another department to your query, you could &quot;showmore.&quot; However, to see employees in a different department altogether, thebest approach would be to execute a &quot;show none&quot; query to clear the screen andthen a &quot;show more&quot; or &quot;show all&quot; query to build the collection back up, or a&quot;show all&quot; query and then another &quot;show fewer&quot; with the new department name.andM;While this approach does allow the user to perform successive &quot;show fewer&quot;queries to refine a collection of records, it is somewhat different than mostRDBMS query approaches and can involve unnecessary steps.andP;  You cannot &quot;showmore&quot; when accessing an IBM database via VIDA; you can only &quot;show all&quot; andstart over.andM;In queries, you can't select the columns to see; you can only select rows.andO;You can save query results to a table.andP;  To save the query itself, you mustrecord it as a macro.andP;  We would rather have the option to save the querywhenever we want without having to worry about macros.andM;The query operators listed in the dialogue box are alpha abbreviations, suchas LE for &quot;less than or equal to&quot; and LT for &quot;less than&quot; (see illustration1).andP;  We found this awkward, since we had to make the translation to the morefamiliar andless;= and andless; symbols.andP;  While the user can enter the symbol directly onthe command line, we would like the option to toggle between the symbols andthe letters in the dialogue box.andM;Reports.andP;  For a report, you specify the tide, subtitle, what columns areincluded and in what order, the report width (either 80 or 132 columns), linebreaks (blank line after a column value changes), and page breaks.andP;  Youcannot modify the column headings, which are the field names.andP;  You can onlyedit the report by printing it to a file and then calling it up in DECwrite.andO;(However, if you have live-linked to a report, editing it requires that thelink be dissolved; here you have to decide between having current data or amore attractive report format, an unwelcome trade-off.)andM;Any totals or calculations are done on the table itself before you run thereport, and they cannot be included in the report specs.andP;  As in queries, youcannot store the report spec except with a macro.andP;  Therefore, if you need todo two types of reports on the same data, you create two macros.andM;We consider the report writer very limited, perhaps too limited even forquick ad hoc reports.andP;  We would like to see at least minimal editingcapabilities for headings and the inclusion of aggregates in the reportdefinition.andP;  We would also like to be able to run a summary report withoutcreating a macro.andM;Digital plans to add more formatting capabilities to the Access reportfunction.andP;  However, rather than build it into a sophisticated and, therefore,complex report writer, the company is considering the option of making asophisticated report writer available to Access in the future.andP;  The reportwriter could then be available to other applications as well.andM;Reports can be in ASCII, DDIF, or PostScript format.andP;  They can be sent to aprinter, a file, the clipboard, or a data block in a DECwrite document viathe &quot;update live link&quot; option in the report dialogue box (see illustration2).andM;Macros.andP;  The Access macro facility is a record and playback option only;there is no macro scripting language.andP;  You can edit a macro, but thisrequires an understanding of the Access command syntax.andP;  Otherwise, yourerecord the macro.andP;  As we have mentioned, macros can be used to save queryand report definitions for repetitive use.andP;  You can include prompts for userinput in an Access macro.andM;Integration.andP;  Access has some impressive integration tools for an end-userproduct.andP;  You can easily combine data from multiple sources by joining anytable to any other with a field in common, including mixed database types.andO;You could join an Rdb table to an IBM DB2 table and view it in DECdecision.andO;(One thing Access doesn't do is create default join definitions if two tableshave a field name in common.andP;  The user must identify the join fields.)andM;You can store a file name in a column and view it as long as it is a DDIFdocument.andP;  For example, you could call up a photo of an employee (an imagefile) or a document relating to the person's performance from an employeetable, viewing the document/image in a separate CDA viewer window on thescreen.andM;Chart is directly accessible from within Access through the &quot;draw chart&quot;option.andP;  CALC.andP;  DECdecision offers a fully functional spreadsheet processor,Calc.andP;  Rather than itemize the wide range of capabilities in Calc, we willhit the highlights.andM;Calc supports a very large worksheet of 702 columns (A-ZZ) by 9,999 rows.andP;  Ithas over 100 built-in functions, including financial, statistical, date/time,mathematical, and trigonometric formulas.andP;  The ability for users to definecustom functions or revise those provided by Calc to meet unique requirementswill be a future enhancement.andP;  Calc can convert 98 percent of Lotus functionswith the conversion program through the CDA Converter Library.andM;Manipulating Data.andP;  As expected, formulas are built using a point and pickapproach.andP;  One nice feature is the ability to select multiple, noncontiguouscell ranges and operate on all of them at once.andP;  Cell entries can beformatted by using both data types and edit string options.andM;Charts.andP;  The Chart function can be accessed directly from Calc with the &quot;drawchart&quot; option.andP;  In addition, a chart definition can be stored in a cell onthe spreadsheet, providing dynamic or &quot;live&quot; data charting (see illustration3).andP;  As changes are made to the spreadsheet, they are reflected in the chart,which can be displayed simultaneously in another window on the screen.andO;Multiple charts can be live at once.andM;Views.andP;  Views are like windows in Lotus, giving the user multiple windowsinto a single spreadsheet.andP;  Each view appears in a separate window on thescreen.andM;Macros.andP;  Calc has both a record/playback macro facility and an extensivemacro language.andP;  The macro language is a high-level, procedural programminglanguage, including the ability to extend and customize the Calc interface.andO;Digital is considering making this a documented feature in the initialversion of the developer's toolkit for DECdecision.andP;  In fact, die entire Calcinterface is one large macro routine.andP;  Digital may decide to customize Calcfor vertical markets.andP;  As in Access, you can include prompts for user inputin a macro.andM;Consolidation.andP;  Calc allows you to consolidate multiple local or remotespreadsheets into a single summary spreadsheet.andP;  This can be performed over arange or the entire spreadsheet, and can be done as a batch operation acrossthe network.andP;  One attractive option is the ability to combine consolidationwith the conversion tools.andP;  For example, a user organization couldperiodically roll up multiple Lotus or 20/20 spreadsheets on remote PCs intoa master Calc spreadsheet at headquarters.andM;A cell or named range in a spreadsheet can be live-linked to a local orremote spreadsheet as well.andP;  Both linking and consolidation offer powerfultools for integrating multiple spreadsheets.andM;What-If.andP;  You can perform some projection analysis without changing theunderlying spreadsheet permanently.andP;  The &quot;what-if&quot; option on the menu allowsyou to make changes to the spreadsheet to see what it would look like, andthen choose whether or not to implement the changes.andM;CHART.andP;  DECchart comes with both DECdecision and DECwrite.andP;  A chart iscreated by combining four components: The data, a chart style, a chartoverlay, and color specifications.andP;  A chart can be saved as a complete chartfile, or each of the four components can be saved separately for future usewith other components.andP;  Chart is the only DECdecision component that supportscolor.andM;Data for a chart comes from the DECchart worksheet (a simple spreadsheetwithin DECchart for directly entering data), from an existing Access table orCalc spreadsheet, or from an imported file.andP;  One of the advantages of havinga worksheet included in DECchart is to give users who use DECwrite but notDECdecision the opportunity to create a table from which to generate a chart.andM;Chartbook.andP;  The DECchart Chartbook describes 9 basic chart types with 44total variations from which the user can choose using the Preferencesdialogue box (see illustration 4).andP;  For example, the bar chart has severalstyles, including clustered, overlapped, or stacked bars.andP;  Each variation isdisplayed pictorially to help the user visualize it.andP;  Chart uses the term&quot;column&quot; chart to mean a vertical bar chart, and &quot;bar&quot; for a horizontal barchart, which we found confusing.andP;  We would rather use the terms &quot;bar&quot; and&quot;horizontal bar,&quot; or &quot;vertical&quot; and &quot;horizontal bar.&quot;andM;Digital is also looking at developing a charting library of symbols toprovide replacement options for bars, etc.andP;  For example, rather than a barrepresenting the number of cars sold last month, you would see a stack oflittle cars.andM;You can create a baseline on a chart and have the values displayed as theyrelate to the baseline, a nice option (e.g., how much each region's salesdiffered from the average).andM;Attributes.andP;  DECchart has an extensive and very flexible set of attributesfor customizing a particular chart.andP;  Some of the attributes are generic tomultiple chart types, such as legend, grid, axis, and data values.andP;  Eachchart type has its own attributes as well.andM;Overlays.andP;  A chart overlay consists of text or graphics that can addpresentation information to the chart.andP;  An overlay can be used for titles,subtitles, footnotes, text labels, boxes, lines with one or two arrowheads toemphasize specific data, etc.andP;  These objects can be placed anywhere on thechart.andP;  The overlay can be edited, moved, and resized in both DECchart andDECwrite.andP;  BUILDER.andP;  Builder, the cross-component macro facility, createswhat Digital calls blueprints.andP;  These are used to automate repetitive tasksacross the DECdecision components.andP;  The user can also incorporate otherapplications into a Builder procedure.andP;  Blueprints can be replayedautomatically as well as edited.andM;Builder uses a tape recorder model for manipulating blueprints.andP;  This isbased on the realistic assumption that most users already have the requisitelevel of literacy here.andP;  Even if the user hasn't any experience with a phoneanswering machine, it's a rare person today who hasn't acquired a tape deck,moved on to a CD player, or used a VCR.andP;  The terms used are the familiarrecord, playback, pause, and splice.andM;A blueprint consists of application boxes and data-link arrows.andP;  The arrowsconnect boxes where data flows out of one into another.andP;  Each box on ablueprint can represent one of the integrated DECdecisionapplications-Access, Calc, Chart, or another Builder blueprint-or a &quot;blackbox&quot; tool that you create and store in your Builder Toolbox.andP;  The integratedapplications are represented with three-dimensional boxes, and black boxtools are represented with two-dimensional boxes.andP;  The box displays the nameof the application or tool and a subtitle identifying the name of the table,spreadsheet, or chart accessed.andM;Thick arrows on the diagram represent data passed between applications.andP;  Athin arrow is used when a nonintegrated application appears in a blueprintand simply represents the recording order.andP;  No data can be transferred to orfrom a nonintegrated application without user intervention.andM;Internally, each box in a blueprint contains the ACS information necessaryfor invoking the component; the commands executed within the application(essentially, the recorded macro); plus special Builder commands, such asData In, Data Out, Open, and Close, that create the component connections.andM;Creating a Blueprint.andP;  You can record a blueprint automatically or manually.andO;When you turn on the automatic record function in Builder, it begins torecord your actions as you open DECdecision components and work with data.andO;Builder does not track every mouse click, but rather instructs integratedapplications to record a step every time you click on the &quot;OK&quot; button in adialogue box.andP;  Builder also starts to generate the blueprint diagram in theBuilder window.andP;  Every time you start up a DECdecision component, a box isadded to the diagram.andP;  New boxes are also added as you open additionaldatafiles within an application.andP;  When data is transferred from oneintegrated application to another, Builder draws a data-link arrow betweenthe two boxes.andP;  As you add objects to the diagram, it can get cluttered,since Builder doesn't automatically redraw the diagram each time.andP;  Thisoptimizes performance for complex diagrams.andP;  Builder will clean up thediagram layout when you ask it to redisplay the diagram.andM;You can pause in recording the blueprint for interruptions or to do somethingthat you do not want included.andP;  Once you choose &quot;stop&quot;, no further actionsare added to the blueprint.andP;  After saving the blueprint, you can play it backor edit it.andM;You cannot automatically record user tools or other (nested) Builderblueprints.andP;  These must be manually recorded.andM;Builder also provides navigation options in addition to the DECwindows scrollbars.andP;  For large blueprints that don't fit in the window, opening anavigation window will display a miniature version of the entire blueprintand show what is currently in the window.andP;  You can scroll or zoom theblueprint from this window.andP;  There are also zoom options on the menu forenlarging or reducing the blueprint in the window.andM;If you double-click on a box in a blueprint, Builder will bring up thecommand browser and display the application commands contained in the box forreview (see illustration 5).andP;  You can edit the commands directly if youunderstand the command syntax, but this is only recommended for advancedusers.andP;  The box containing the commands is not very wide, and we were unableto resize it.andP;  Therefore, only a few words of each command can be seen,requiring horizontal scrolling.andP;  We would like to be able to resize the boxto see the whole line at once for browsing.andM;Double-clicking on an arrow will display the data reference that is passedbetween the two applications.andP;  The &quot;data out&quot; and &quot;data in&quot; commands areshown as they would look in the command browser.andP;  It is not alwaysimmediately obvious how to read the data commands and to interpret accuratelywhat they represent.andM;You can print either the blueprint diagram (PostScript output) or the list ofthe commands contained in the blueprint (a DDIF document).andM;Playback.andP;  A blueprint can be played back interactively or in the background.andO;Either way, Builder highlights the active boxes and arrows in the blueprintwindow as it is running.andP;  Interactive playback displays the applicationwindows and commands as you recorded them.andP;  Background playback is faster anduses fewer system resources.andP;  Applications appear as icons in the Icon Box asthey are running, but windows do not appear on the screen.andP;  As in &quot;record&quot;,you can interrupt the playback with the Pause command or stop it altogether.andM;Error-Handling.andP;  Builder displays an error message if it cannot complete ablueprint for some reason.andP;  (Required data or files may have been moved ordeleted.) For integrated applications, both the Builder error messages andthose issued by the application are displayed.andM;Editing.andP;  As an alternative to editing Builder blueprints by editing thecommands directly (which you can do), Builder provides a more graphicaloption with &quot;splice&quot; mode.andP;  Splice allows you to use automatic record andplayback simultaneously to add or delete operations.andP;  You simply play backthe blueprint to the point where you want to modify the procedure, and recordthe changes or delete parts of the blueprint.andP;  Builder changes the diagram asyou do this so you can see that the changes have been made.andM;When playing back a blueprint in splice mode, you can step through theblueprint by application, by data link, or by command (see illustration 6).andO;This tells Builder when to automatically pause the playback for you.andP;  You canturn on automatic record to add operations to the blueprint or deletecommands.andM;Builder also has a debugger for investigating blueprint execution problems inmore detail, with similar options for stepping through the blueprint.andM;The Toolbox.andP;  You can add user-defined tools to your Builder toolboxpermanently, or define them only for a particular blueprint.andP;  For example,you can define the VMS Mail Utility as a tool (called &quot;mail&quot;) in yourtoolbox, include it in a blueprint, and use it to automatically send reportscreated by DECdecision to a distribution list.andP;  You can essentially addanything to a blueprint black box, including operating system commands,command procedures entered at the command line, or a program.andM;Guide.andP;  A Guide document describes a Builder blueprint.andP;  You create thisdocument with your favorite editor, and then fill in the Guide dialogue boxwith the document name.andP;  This associates the Guide text file with theblueprint.andP;  When this is done, the Guide icon in the Builder window will behighlighted when the blueprint is open.andP;  When you mail the blueprint, a copyof the Guide document is packaged and sent, too.andP;  You can also display theGuide document from within Builder.andM;Mailing Blueprints.andP;  Builder maintains external references to macros, Guidedocuments, and to other blueprints called by a blueprint.andP;  If you reference aprivate macro in an application box and later mail the blueprint, DECdecisionpacks up the macro and sends it as well.andP;  The same thing is true of Guidesand nested blueprints.andM;You can only view a blueprint diagram in Builder.andP;  The DDIF Viewer displays amessage to that effect if a user tries to call up a blueprint from theDECwindows Mail inbox, for example.andM;Futures.andP;  Digital is considering several enhancements that will addfunctionality to Builder in future releases.andP;  One development underway ismaking additional &quot;blueprint drafting tools&quot; available to Builder.andP;  Exampleshere are a parameter-entry tool, which will allow the user to display adialogue box to capture initial parameter values before running a blueprint;an if-then-else tool for branching logic; and a converter tool to allow anapplication that supports Builder but not CDA to invoke the CDA conversionlibrary and convert its data to/from CDA.andP;  As additional drafting toolsbecome available and are added to the CDA library, they will appearautomatically on DECdecision menus as Builder tools.andM;These tools move in the direction of developing a macro or script languagewithin Builder that would provide more functionality, flexibility, andcontext around the objects in a blueprint.andP;  Builder currently supports onlymacros within the integrated DECdecision components and cannot wrapadditional logic around the flow of a blueprint.andP;  The if-then-else constructfor branching logic is a good example here.andM;Digital is also developing Builder blueprints that will be useful as verticalapplications.andM;We would like to see a closer connection to DECwrite from Builder (inaddition to the DECwrite live link direction).andP;  This would allow DECwrite toparticipate as an integrated application in a blueprint and to play in theprocedural automation game.andP;  (DECwrite can be accessed currently in ablueprint, but only as a nonintegrated, or black box application.)andO;Automatically mailing compound documents after they have been updated wouldprobably be an attractive application to many organizations.andM;SUMMARY.andP;  We like using DECdecision.andP;  The DECwindows environment makes iteasy to move among the components without losing context.andP;  Each individualcomponent has a high level of functionality (we would like to see theenhancements we mentioned for Access, however), yet all are easy to use.andP;  Thecomponents are well-integrated and play an important part in buildingcompound documents with DECwrite.andM;We found Builder very easy to use and understand.andP;  Digital has done a goodjob of designing the visual/graphical aspect of Builder and providing a clearreference model for the user in working with blueprints.andP;  We like Builder'sterminology and resulting analogies-the concept of building blueprints (whichimplies graphics) with drafting tools and integrated applications, and thetape recorder model for blueprint operations.andM;DECdecision provides a higher level of integration within its modules thandoes any of IBM's current or announced decision support products.andO;DECdecision is also well-integrated into the overall DECwindows environment.andM;With Builder for tying the components together into an automated procedure,DECdecision can present some real competition for Metaphor.andP;  The advantagesof DECdecision are the functionality of the modules, its relationship withDECwrite, and the underlying architecture that gives DECdecision access toservices and applications across the network.andP;  In addition, even though IBMhas ported Metaphor to the PS/2 hardware platform, Metaphor is still limitedby its proprietary operating kernel.andP;  As a result, the user cannot runMetaphor in a window alongside other active applications such as mail, acompound document editor, etc.andM;On the other hand, Metaphor is a much more mature product, with hundreds ofthousands of user-designed decision support applications under its belt.andO;Metaphor also provides a more visual representation of data relationships,access to a data dictionary, and some of the more advanced languageconstructs for building complex procedures (e.g., if-then logic).andM;Where does the user go if DECdecision doesn't offer the requiredfunctionality? One option is to move the underlying data into Rdb via Accessand then to use more sophisticated application development tools, such asDigital's Rally 4GL or third-party, front-end tools from RelationalTechnology et al.andM;Digital will also continue to expand and enhance DECdecision's capabilities.andO;As with live links in DECwrite, the company is working with third parties toallow their applications to snap into DECdecision as additional/alternativecomponents.andP;  We expect familiar products like dbase and Lotus to be part ofDECdecision in the future.andP;  These applications will be integrated with theirfellow components, plugging in as boxes in a Builder blueprint as well assharing data with the other modules.andM;Conclusions Digital continues to move in the right direction, implementingits strategy on three levels concurrently.andP;  Architecturally, Digital is aheadof the game with its Compound Document Architecture (CDA) and ApplicationControl Services (ACS) with live links.andP;  A more complete implementation ofobject orientation is currently under development.andP;  An object manager similarto the NewWave Object Management Facility could eliminate the need forapplications to maintain live link information.andP;  In addition, a remoteprocedure call mechanism will facilitate distributed applications.andM;Digital is already well underway in introducing a wide variety of NASservices with more to come in areas such as document management, projectmanagement, and an overall filing cabinet.andM;In applications development, we look forward to enhancements to currentDECwindows/CDA applications like DECwrite and DECdecision.andP;  In view of theinitial success of DECdecision, we harbor high hopes and expectations forfuture decision support products.andM;We also see convergence in some areas.andP;  The anticipated X.400 mail product,for example, could eventually become the one mail system supported in all ofDigital's platforms and environments.andP;  We also expect that Digital's multiplefile cabinets/systems (DECwindows Mail, DECdecision Access, All-In-1) willmerge with the introduction of NAS-based filing services and products.andM;Additional Digital applications will become CDA/ DECwindows compliant, andthere will certainly be a steady flow of third-party interest in andcommitment to the Digital environment, if current trends are any indication.andM;Digital has set the stage, and the next act is a further adaptation of itsprimary integration platform, All-In-1, to NAS and the introduction ofclient/server cooperative processing to take full advantage of die desktopworkstation.andP;  We're ready and waiting.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
