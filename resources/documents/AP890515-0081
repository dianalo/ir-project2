The material poses no environmental hazard, the U.S. DefenseDepartment said in a report given to the Japanese Embassy inWashington on Friday.   A copy was given to The Associated Press today after Cabinetmembers said Japan would check for possible environmental dangers.   The Foreign Ministry later formed a team to evaluate the U.S.report and decide whether more studies are needed. The experts comefrom the Defense Agency, the coast guard, the Environmental Agencyand the fisheries authority.   The only country ever attacked with nuclear weapons, Japan issensitive to the nuclear issue. Since the 1965 accident wasdisclosed last week, several demonstrations have been held andopposition members of Parliament have pressed the government to geta full explanation from Washington.   Japan also still was asking whether the aircraft carrierTiconderoga had been sailing to a Japanese port when one of its A-4Skyhawks accidentally fell into the sea while carrying theone-megaton bomb.   This country bans nuclear weapons from its territory but isthought to look the other way in the case of port calls by U.S.vessels likely to be carrying nuclear bombs. The Navy does notcomment on whether its ships carry nuclear weapons.   Japan asked the United States for an explanation last week afterdetails of the 1965 accident were disclosed in Washington byWilliam Arkin, a researcher for the liberal Institute of PolicyStudies.   Arkin said the B-43 bomb was not in danger of exploding but its33 pounds of plutonium could threaten the environment as thestructure of the bomb deteriorated.   The Defense Department report said the bomb was not built towithstand the tremendous pressure of the 16,000-foot depths inwhich it sank and its nuclear materials had leaked into the sea.   The high explosives that would trigger a nuclear blast alsowould have been gradually neutralized by exposure to water, thereport said.   ``This action will assure that no nuclear or high explosivedetonation can ever occur in the environment now or in thefuture,'' it said.   Nuclear weapons specialists at the U.S. National Laboratory hadtested the unspecified type of nuclear material by dissolving it insea water, the report said.   ``These tests show that the material will dissolve in arelatively short time. Because of its high density, the solutewould have settled very quickly to the floor of the ocean alongwith other sedimentation. Therefore, there is no environmentalimpact,'' it said.   Foreign Minister Sousuke Uno, responding in Parliament toopposition questions on the incident, said Japan accepted theAmerican report saying there was no environmental danger.   ``But I think it necessary to have experts from the concernedministries consider the pertinent issues'' such as environmentalpollution, Uno said.   He and Chief Cabinet Secretary Keizo Obuchi both said thequestion of whether the Ticonderoga had docked in Japan was stillunanswered.   ``We consider the U.S. side gave a trustworthy explanation ofthe U.S. evaluation of the incident,'' Obuchi told a newsconference.   Asked whether the ship had gone on to dock at the Japanese portof Yokusuka, Obuchi replied, ``We have no confirmation at presentbut we are inquiring now.''   On Saturday, about 500 people demonstrated in Tokyo calling forthe elimination of nuclear arms and for an end to the U.S.-JapanSecurity Treaty, under which about 60,000 U.S. troops are based inJapan.   The treaty calls for consultations between the two countries ifnuclear weapons are introduced into Japan, and since there has beenno U.S. request for such consultations, the Japanese government hasalways said it believes the United States is complying with Japan'santi-nuclear policy.   In 1981, the United States described the accident as one of thetwo most serious ever involving U.S. nuclear devices _ the otherwas the loss of the submarine Thresher in the Atlantic in 1968 _but implied it occurred 500 miles from land.   In fact, the bomb sank about 80 miles off an inhabited island inOkinawa prefecture in far southern Japan.</TEXT></DOC>
