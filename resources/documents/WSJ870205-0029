Ernest BeazleyStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 02/05/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> X LABORMINING, METALS (NON-PRECIOUS) (MIN) </IN><DATELINE> PITTSBURGH  </DATELINE><TEXT>   USX Corp., after settling a six-month steel strike, said it will cut its steelmaking capacity by about 27%.    The nation's No. 1 steelmaker said yesterday that it won't restart most of the facilities at its plants in Baytown, Texas, and Provo, Utah. Coupled with closures of blast furnaces and finishing facilities at other mills, the cutbacks will trim the company's steelmaking capacity to 19 million tons from 26.2 million tons, affecting 3,700 steelworkers.    Despite the cutbacks, USX appears to be restarting more steelmaking capacity than much of the industry expected. In fact, David M. Roderick, USX chairman, said the company expects to regain its 17% share of domestic steel shipments as early as the third quarter.    &quot;We are not giving up any capability to put product in the marketplace from where we were before the strike,&quot; Mr. Roderick said, acknowledging that prices may weaken in the face of soft steel-consuming markets.    Mr. Roderick noted that the company had warned the United Steelworkers union of possible plant closings before 22,000 members walked off the job last August. The USX executive said the heavy cost of restarting idle equipment played a major role in the company's decision. He also cited a depressed market for pipe manufactured by the Texas mill.    Mr. Roderick's remarks follow the company's decision this week to recall workers at its other five steelmaking complexes. Last Saturday, the union ratified a new four-year contract, ending a 184-day-old dispute that had shut down USX mills since August.    Mr. Roderick, while saying the company doesn't plan to discount to recapture its lost market share, stressed that USX won't permit competitors to take customers away by undercutting it in price. &quot;It'll be a cold day in hell when that happens,&quot; he said.    Some buyers said the steelmaker's determination to recapture its market share firmed their conviction that steel prices will soften in coming months. Many cite the prospects for pricing warfare between USX and LTV Corp., the nation's No. 2 steelmaker, which picked up a hefty portion of USX business during the strike. &quot;You'll have considerably more tons chasing the same number of orders -- prices are bound to weaken,&quot; one USX customer said.    Competitors, too weak financially to afford to shut their own mills, had hoped that USX would launch a broader retreat, creating more room for them in an industry suffering from moribund prices caused by a glut of steel. &quot;Capacity reductions (at USX) are meaningless to the rest of the industry unless it means lower shipments,&quot; said Donald F. Barnett, a steel economist.    USX shares closed yesterday at $24.875, up $1.125, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Volume was 3.6 million shares.    USX officials play down speculation of discounting. They say they plan to return to the market slowly, averting price disruption and restarting mills only as orders justify resumed operation. In 1985, its last full year of steel production, USX shipped 12.5 million tons -- 17% of the industry's 72.7 million tons in shipments.    Thus far, USX has moved slowly to resume operations. Of 11 blast furnaces at four plants, the company plans to restart only four this month. In addition, raw steelmaking at a fifth mill -- in Fairfield, Ala. -- will halt for two years while new machinery is installed. The Fairfield action, coupled with yesterday's closings, effectively lowers the company's steelmaking capacity to around 17 million tons.    Contributing to the likelihood of lower prices is the bleak outlook for the industry's key markets. A recent Commerce Department forecast, for instance, predicted that the auto and construction industries would consume less steel this year than in 1986. USX, in fact, internally forecasts industrywide shipments of only about 65 million tons this year.    Another reason is the continued surfeit of steelmaking capacity. USX has led steelmakers the past decade in slashing capacity, reaching its current size from a 1978 capacity of 37.9 million tons. Nonetheless, the industry as a whole has lagged behind USX. John Tumazos, Oppenheimer andamp; Co.'s steel analyst, estimates that U.S. steelmakers have more surplus capacity today than in 1977, reflecting steel's replacement by other materials and increasing imports.    USX said it stopped short of declaring the Texas and Utah mills permanently shut -- a move that would entitle workers to severance benefits. Senior company officials, though, said there was virtually no chance that the facilities would reopen.    The closings are a blow to the United Steelworkers union, which had touted job security provisions in the USX contract in selling the pact to its members. Nonetheless, capacity cutbacks had been expected for months. And last week, USX reported that it had taken $1.03 billion in pre-tax charges connected to mill closings. </TEXT></DOC>
