Harper  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Garden  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  YES, THE WORLD CAN USE A NEW PERENNIALS BOOK  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Books  </MEMO><TEXT>  Macmillan, $40; THERE are so many books on designing with perennials out now.It takes a lot of nerve for some garden writer to come out with another oneand title it &quot;Designing With Perennials,&quot; no less. And ask 40 bucks for thething.;   Yet that's just what Pamela J. Harper did. And I suggest you forkover the money if you want to learn more about perennial design.;   Not manyperennial design books are a real help with perennial design. And please --the often-seen combo of coneflowers, sedum and ornamental grass threatens tobe the perennial-garden version of a redtip hedge. Doesn't anyone have betterideas?;   Harper does, and how. Her gardening background in England and theUnited States prepared her superbly for the task.;   Her topics are made toorder: choosing plants; display schemes; using size, shape and texture; color;foliage; ground covers; using perennials with other plants; and gardenfeatures and ornaments.;   As comprehensive as the text is, some of it is notmeant for the novice gardener. There are many long passages of this and thatscientific plant name, and if you don't recognize them, it's like reading aLatin garden book. So go ahead -- let your eyes drift over to the prettypictures. You'll still get your money's worth; there are plenty of plants in arange of settings.;   The chapter on color is important. It's where you'reintroduced to Harper's &quot;echoes&quot; concept: nearby plants that share or &quot;echo&quot; asimilar feature or color.;   Her examples -- white iris and variegated hosta;catmint and purple-flowered pansies to name two -- are testimony to the idea'seffectiveness.;   &quot;Designing With Perennials&quot; is an excellent, valuablereference that should return the investment many times over.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  MARK STITH, Cox News Service  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910829  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  August  </MONTH><PG.COL>  2D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  296  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday, August 29, 199100242233,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
