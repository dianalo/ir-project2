The calculation of these transmission losses are typicallybased upon a {Beta}-matrix which represents a particular system networkconfiguration and load distribution. The {Beta}-matrix elements, called{Beta}-constants, are normally obtained off-line for somewhat nominalsystem conditions, and some utilities may calculate several sets representativeof different nominal system conditions. Where a system spans two timezones, a departure from the nominal conditions in the form of a geographicalload shift may occur. This paper reports on an investigation of geographicalload shift and its effect on the evaluation of the economics of energypurchases and sales.</TEXT></DOC>
