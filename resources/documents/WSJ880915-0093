The bill, supported by the panel's 10 Democrats and opposed by its nine Republican members, would end all U.S. investment in South Africa -- requiring corporations and individuals to divest themselves of their holdings -- and ban most imports from that country.    The House passed a similar bill last month by a 244-132 vote. The bill's supporters in both chambers see it as a followup to a milder sanctions bill that was passed by Congress in 1986 over President Reagan's veto. The 1986 bill called for subsequent review of those sanctions and possible further actions to protest South Africa's apartheid policy.    The administration has said the president would veto sanctions legislation. Yesterday, Charles Redman, the State Department spokesman, said, &quot;Our position is clearly expressed on that issue. It hasn't changed.&quot;    This year's bill may be doomed because it lacks the broad bipartisan support that drove the 1986 measure. In the Senate, two Republican moderates who played major roles in the 1986 legislation, Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana and Sen. Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas, oppose the new bill. Sen. Lugar, who steered the 1986 legislation through the Senate when he was chairman of the foreign relations panel, believes cutting all economic ties with Pretoria isn't an effective way to attempt to influence policy there.    An aide to Sen. Alan Cranston (D., Calif.), a key sponsor of the bill, conceded that &quot;it's going to be tough&quot; to muster the necessary two-thirds majority for the Senate to override a presidential veto. Last month's House vote fell short of the margin needed to override a veto in that chamber. A two-thirds vote is needed in both chambers to override a veto.    In an effort to attract more support from moderates, Sen. Cranston modified the bill by removing a provision that would have prevented foreign oil companies that continue to do business in South Africa from bidding on new U.S. oil leases. The provision, which is contained in the House bill, provoked a protest from Great Britain about the possible extension of punitive measures to U.S. subsidiaries of British oil companies.    The bill's chances on the Senate floor also are dimmed by the prospect of a filibuster, possibly led by Sen. Jesse Helms (R., N.C.), at a time when members of Congress will be anxious to clean up unfinished business and return home to campaign for the November election.    Nevertheless, Sen. Cranston's aide noted that the election season also could ignite interest in the measure if there were to be a sudden, violent eruption in South Africa. Moreover, Democrats would like to use the sanctions issue to embarrass Vice President George Bush. Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis favors anti-apartheid sanctions.    Besides arguing that sanctions wouldn't be effective, the administration contends that the bill would disrupt U.S.-mediated talks among South Africa, Angola and Cuba. The talks are aimed at achieving the withdrawal of South African troops from neighboring Namibia and Cuban troops from Angola. </TEXT></DOC>
