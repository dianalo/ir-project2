The answer is elusive. But a look at why two of Wall Street's most bullish strategists recently scaled back their recommended levels of stock holdings puts last week's discount-rate increase in some perspective.    Suresh Bhirud, the chief market strategist at Oppenheimer andamp; Co., took a hard look at his basic economic analysis the week before the Federal Reserve raised its discount rate, or the rate it charges on loans to financial institutions, to 6 1/2% from 6%. He came to the same conclusion that the Fed apparently reached: The economy was in danger of overheating.    Consequently, Mr. Bhirud issued his recommendation to investors to increase the cash portions of their portfolios to 20% from 15% almost simultaneously with the Fed's discount-rate announcement.    &quot;I've been one of the most bullish strategists, but I had to cave in to the fundamentals,&quot; he says. &quot;I came to the conclusion that not only is the economy strong, but it's gathering momentum.&quot; It has to be slowed, he says, and the brake is going to be higher rates, probably at least one percentage point higher than current rates.    With rates headed higher, Mr. Bhirud says, stock prices are clearly headed lower. How much lower depends on how quickly rates rise and on whether investors begin to fear an imminent recession, he says. The rise in the discount rate &quot;means minor troubles for stocks,&quot; Mr. Bhirud says. &quot;But at some point, if rates keep rising investors will start fearing a recession.&quot;    Mr. Bhirud, however, doesn't think a recession is likely. It's possible the Fed could push too hard, he says, but the more probable scenario is for the Fed to ease up on rates as soon as it sees signs that the economy is cooling.    &quot;I still believe that the economy should show signs of slowing down by the first half of next year, and I still believe that we'll then get some significant stimulation,&quot; he says. &quot;We've just got to get through this digestive period.&quot;    For Abby Joseph Cohen, the chief strategist at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the discount-rate increase was anticlimatic. She had already recommended that clients reduce their exposure to stocks by going to 90% stock from 95%. The recommendation, she said, amounted to a change from &quot;very bullish&quot; to just &quot;bullish.&quot;    In an explanatory research abstract mailed to clients Aug. 2, Mrs. Cohen cited a more optimistic consensus outlook (although still not as bullish as her own); a 22% gain in stock prices since last October's crash; and higher interest rates, both short-term and long-term. These, she said, added up to a fairly valued stock market instead of an undervalued one, and therefore one less likely to provide positive surprises.    Although they were in place before the discount-rate increase, Mrs. Cohen says, the factors influencing her recent recommendation remain valid. Higher rates have been part of Mrs. Cohen's long-term forecast since the crash, and she still expects the economy to continue growing through 1989 before sinking into a recession in 1990.    And although the discount-rate boost did provoke a sharp drop in stock prices last week, Mrs. Cohen says little has changed in the basic valuation of the market. &quot;The increase in interest rates has been pretty much offset by the decline in stock prices,&quot; she says.    Mrs. Cohen, in fact, sees a silver lining in the current stock-price retreat: Lower prices improve what she calls the &quot;private market value&quot; of some stocks.    Private market value, she says, is a company's value in terms of something other than earnings and dividends. Companies with strong cash flow, for instance, or proprietary technology shouldn't necessarily be measured just by their earnings and dividend growth, she says. And in view of the rash of takeovers, leveraged buy-outs and stock buy-backs in recent months, lots of investors appear to be using those other measures.    &quot;Beauty is in the eye of the beholder,&quot; Mrs. Cohen says.    ---   Friday's Market Activity   Stock prices edged slightly lower in a lackluster summer session.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.78 to 2037.52. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 177 million shares as declining issues led gainers by 742 to 679.    For the week, the industrial average had its biggest loss since mid-April, falling 81.61 points, or 3.85%.    Niagara Mohawk Power was the most active Big Board issue, with more than 50 million shares changing hands as investors sought to capture the utility's dividend. The stock closed unchanged at 13 3/8.    Best Buy was the biggest gainer, rising 2 5/8 to 12 1/4. It said it hired an investment banking firm &quot;to explore business opportunities.&quot;    Three Japanese stocks that are traded in the U.S. as American depositary receipts were the biggest losers. Matsushita Electrical Industries declined 5 to 212, Honda Motor was off 4 1/4 to 167 5/8, and Hitachi closed at 139 7/8, down 3 1/8.    Among blue-chips, International Business Machines lost 1 to 118, F.W. Woolworth gained 5/8 to 48 5/8, AMR was down 1/4 to 42 7/8, and Primerica rose 1 1/4 to 28. </TEXT></DOC>
