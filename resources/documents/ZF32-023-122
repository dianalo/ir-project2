 Touche's 486/33 ISA has shattered theonce sturdy $4,000 barrier with a $3,499 price.andM;It's difficult not to marvel when such an attractively priced computer comesequipped with 4MB of RAM, 128K of processor RAM cache, dual floppies, a 200MBESDI hard drive, an Orchid ProDesigner IIS SVHA card, a Sony CPD-1304multiscanning monitor, a CD-ROM drive, DOS 5.0, and Windows.andP;  Trim the cacheback to 64K, drop down to an 80MB IDE drive, and settle for a Sony HG-1304monitor, and you come with a 486 system at an even more incredible $2,799.andM;The basic box is a 24.0 by 7.5 by 17.5 tower enclosure, with four half-heightbays accessible through the front panel and two more inside the case.andP;  Thesebays are filled with a hefty complement of drives, which are included withthe system (the hard drive is a full-height device), and there are still twomore half-height bays available in a custom-mounted metal stirrup below thestandard six.andP;  Routing power to all the possible drives is a PC Power andCooling 300-watt power supply.andM;Touche uses an AMI Voyager II motherboard with the usual eight ISA slots (six16-bit and two 8-bit).andP;  As shipped, after you count the UltraStor cachingESDI controller (1MB installed), the parallel/serial I/O card, OrchidProDesigner IIS, and Future Domain 8-bit SCSI adapter for the CD-ROM, you areleft with four open slots.andP;  The tape drive works off the floppy drivecontroller on the UltraStor card.andM;There's also a proprietary 32-bit slot that's used to hold an expansionmemory card, although not for the typical reasons.andP;  Like many similarsystems, the Voyager board has eight SIMM sockets, and with 4MB SIMMs, easilyhits 32MB on the board.andP;  However, the typical eight-socket system will startwith 4MB or 8MB using 1MB SIMMs--if you've reached 8MB and need more, you'reusually forced to throw away the 1MB modules and start over with 4MB SIMMs.andM;The Voyager II makes that an option instead of a necessity.andP;  If you have 8MBor less installed on the motherboard, you can use the proprietary 32-bit slotto hold an additional 16MB, giving you as much as 24MB of RAM withoutthrowing anything away.andP;  Beyond that, you'll have to revert to 4MB modules(the expansion card becomes superfluous).andP;  But with 1MB SIMM pricing rangingfrom $60 to $100, it's a significant advantage.andM;The tape backup, at an additional $349, is an absolute must for anyreasonable hard drive system, and the Colorado 250MB tape drive is suitablefor the 200MB size of the ESDI drive.andP;  The CD-ROM, on the other hand, is abit of extravagance.andP;  At some point in the not-too-distant future, access tothe large amount of information possible with CD-ROM technology will beessential.andP;  For now, Touche's free gift is simply a nice extra.andM;Touche is offering a $249 special on CD-ROM software that includes anIllustrated Encyclopedia, National Geographic's Mammals, World Atlas, U.S.andO;Atlas, Reference Library, and an assortment of games.andP;  It's not an especiallyexciting selection if you're looking for more detailed business information,but it does give you a look at the tip of the CD-ROM software iceberg.andM;The 486/33 has no standard money-back return policy, but what Touche doesoffer is a guarantee of compatibility.andP;  If you find that the system isincompatible with any software or hardware that normally works in a 486environment, Touche will take it back from you.andM;Touche offers a longer-than-average two-year warranty on parts and labor forthe system.andP;  Repairs are made through phone diagnostics and parts shipping.andO;If you do have a stubborn problem during the warranty period, TRW on-siteservice is available.andP;  Outright on-site service would have been nicer,especially for a 486 system, but it would have added to the cost.andM;If you want inexpensive, if you want fast, if you want a warranty that willgive you some running room, you want the Touche 486/33 ISA.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
