The aircraft are to be manufactured by Embraer-Empressa Brasileira Aeronautica, based in Brazil, and will cost a total of about $19.2 million, according to an Atlantic spokesman.    The airplanes are to be delivered by February and will be used to expand service at the airline's two hubs in Atlanta and Dallas-Fort Worth.    Atlantic currently has 36 planes. It has already agreed to buy an additional 22 planes from the Brazilian company over the next year but decided to buy out Air Midwest's contracts in addition because Embraer-Empressa is sold out through next year, the spokesman said. </TEXT></DOC>
