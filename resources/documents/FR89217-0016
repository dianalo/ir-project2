On June 25, 1986, the FHWA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking(NPRM) in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (51 FR 23088), Docket No. MC-123. A final rulewas published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on December 19, 1988 (53 FR 50961) revising 49CFR Parts 385 and 386. It has been determined that no further action isnecessary at this time.Section 206 of the Act directed the Secretary to issue regulations, notlater than 18 months from date of enactment, pertaining to commercial motorvehicle safety. On January 23, 1985, the FHWA published an advance noticeof proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (50 FR 2998), Docket No. MC-114, seeking publiccomment concerning possible revisions to the Federal Motor Carrier SafetyRegulations (FMCSRs). It was announced that the ANPRM was the first stepin implementing Section 206 of the Act. Subsequently, it was decided thateach Part of the FMCSRs should be addressed separately. Thus a public docketwas established for each Part of the FMCSRs.The following information will identify each rulemaking action that hadbeen initiated as a result of the passage of the Act. Further, a briefsummary of each rulemaking action is set forth and followed by the statusof each.<ITAG tagnum="84">Part 390_General</ITAG>The proposed revision sought to assist the various segments of the truckand bus industries in their efforts to comply with the FMCSRs by (1) incorporatingdefinitions from the Act; (2) clarifying and updating the regulations;(3) eliminating redundancy; (4) combining and locating in a single placethe definitions of many general items presently located throughout theFMCSRs; and (5) addressing comments concerning the elimination of certainregulatory exemptions and, in particular, recission of the ``exempt intracityoperation.'' Also proposed were conforming amendments to 49 CFR Parts 391-397and 399.A notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on July 13, 1987 (52 FR 26278), Docket No. MC-114.The comment period closed September 11, 1987.<T3>Status: </T3>A final rule was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on May 19, 1988, (53 FR 18042). As noted in thefinal rule, a related issue, which is not a requirement of the Act, concerningFHWA's authority over private carriers of passengers, is to be the subjectof a separate rulemaking.<ITAG tagnum="84">Part 391_Qualifications of Drivers</ITAG>On January 23, 1985, the FHWA proposed to require motor carriers to ensurethat drivers who operate (1) commercial motor vehicles transporting certainclasses of harzardous materials or (2) cargo tank (including portable tanks)commercial motor vehicles requiring placards meet additional or more stringentqualification requirements (50 FR 2998), Docket No. MC-120.<T3>Status: </T3>The additional driver qualification requirements concerninga single driver's license and alcohol and drug disqualification have alreadybeen addressed in the final rule that created Part 383, Commercial Driver'sLicense Standards; Requirements and Penalties, and amended 49 CFR 391.11,Qualifications of drivers. See 52 FR 20574, June 1, 1987, Docket No. MC-125.The Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) is presently developinga rulemaking action which will propose to establish minimum training requirementsfor persons involved in the transportation of hazardous materials cargo.Included in the RSPA's proposed regulations will be minimum training standardsfor drivers that relate to the proper location, distribution, and securementof hazardous materials cargo. Any additional driver qualification requirementsconcerning the use of controlled substances will be addressed in a comprehensiverulemaking that will be published as an NPRM in the near future. In viewof the above, it has been determined that no further action is necessaryat this time and Part 391 is considered to be reissued pursuant to theAct. Docket No. MC-120 is thereby closed.<ITAG tagnum="84">Part 392_Driving of Motor Vehicles</ITAG>In responding to the ANPRM, Docket No. MC-114 (50 FR 2998), only sevencommenters offered comments relating to Part 392. Five commenters contendedthat andSection; 392.3, Ill or fatigued operator, should be rewritten toprotect the rights of drivers who refuse to drive when fatigued. The existingrule prohibits the driver from operating a commercial motor vehicle whenfatigued and prohibits the motor carrier from requiring or permitting adriver to operate a commercial motor vehicle when fatigued. Section 405of the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 (STAA) (Pub. L. 97-424,96 Stat. 2097, 2157) established a mechanism to protect drivers who believethey have been discriminated against. We found no need to revise this sectionto accomplish the commenter's request. One commenter suggested repeal ofthe mandatory seat belt requirement contained in andSection; 392.16, Useof seat belts. We believe that the use of seat belts saves lives and enhancesthe safety of all users of the highways. An analysis conducted by the NationalHighway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) National Center for Statisticsand Analysis revealed that for 1985 more than 2,000 lives would have beensaved if every State mandated the use of seat belts for that year. Therefore,we believe no change in this section is warranted. Another commenter suggestedamending andSection; 392.22, Emergency signals; stopped vehicles, by insertingthe equivalent number of paces next to each distance prescribed for placementof emergency signals to give drivers a clearer understanding of the requireddistances. We do not believe such a change is necessary. The rule, as written,is clear. Measurement in feet is universally recognized. A pace is definedas 30 inches in the dictionary and as 36 inches when used in a militaryparlance.<T3>Status: </T3>It has been determined that no further action is necessaryat this time and Part 392 is considered to be reissued pursuant to theAct.<ITAG tagnum="84">Part 393_Parts and Accessories Necessary for Safe Operation</ITAG>The FHWA proposed amendments to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations(FMCSRs) relative to requirements affecting axles and attaching parts,brake systems, frame and frame assemblies, lights, steering systems, suspensionsystems, wheels and rims, fuel tanks, fuel systems, and other vehicle partsand accessories. This action was taken to enhance the safe operation ofcommercial motor vehicles in interstate commerce.An NPRM was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on February 26, 1987 (52 FR 5892), Docket No.MC-127. The comment period closed June 29, 1987.<T3>Status:</T3> A final rule was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on December 7, 1988, (53 FR 49380). The effectivedate of the final rule will be March 7, 1989.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Part 394_Notification and Reporting of Accidents  </ITAG>The FHWA amended Part 394 of FMCSRs by revising those sections relatingto the notification and reporting of accidents. This amendment raised thereporting threshold for property damage accidents from $2,000 to $4,200.Subsequently, on March 10, 1987, the reporting threshold was adjusted upwardto $4,400. In addition, under the accident reporting criteria, the definitionof ``bodily injury'' was clarified for reporting purposes. The FHWA furtherclarified the reporting requirements under Part 394 by addressing the instanceswhen an accident report was not timely filed, because a motor carrier wasunaware of the accident at the time or was unaware that it was reportable. <T3>Status:</T3> A final rule was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on February 20, 1986 (51 FR 6125), Docket No.MC-117. The effective date of the final rule was January 1, 1986. The secondfinal rule was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on March 10, 1987 (52 FR 7277) and was effectiveon the same date.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Part 395_Hours of Service of Drivers  </ITAG>The FHWA amended Part 395 of the FMCSRs to (1) eliminate four items currentlyrequired on the driver's record of duty status; (2) clarify the presentexemption pertaining to the preparation of a driver's record of duty statuswithin a 100 air-mile radius of the driver's work reporting location; (3)redefine the retail store delivery exemption (December 10 to December 25);(4) incorporate the current interpretation of both the 60-hour and 70-houron-duty weekly limitation into the hours of service regulations; (5) revisethe definition of on-duty time; and (6) revise the applicability sectionof this Part. These amendments will reduce the paperwork burden, providemore judicious accounting of time worked thereby reducing the possibilityof accrued driver fatigue, and make the regulations more easily understood. <T3>Status:</T3> A final rule was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on October 30, 1987 (52 FR 41718), Docket No.MC-119. The effective date of the final rule was November 30, 1987.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Part 396_Inspection, Repair, and Maintenance  </ITAG>The FHWA proposed changes to the Federal motor carrier inspection standardscontained in Part 396 of the FMCSRs. The proposed revisions would requiremotor carriers to comply with Federal inspection standards conducted througha State inspection program, commercial garages, or an authorized self-inspectionprogram.  An NPRM was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on February 26, 1987 (52 FR 5913), Docket No.MC-113. The comment period closed June 29, 1987.  <T3>Status:</T3> A final rule was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on December 7, 1988, (53 FR 49402). The finalrule will be effective on December 7, 1989.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Part 398_Transportation of Migrant Workers  </ITAG>There were no comments received concerning this Part of the FMCSRs. TheFHWA sees no need to amend these regulations at this time.  <T3>Status:</T3> It has been determined that no further action is necessaryat this time and Part 398 is considered to be reissued pursuant to theAct.<ITAG tagnum="84">Part 399_Employee Safety and Health Standards</ITAG>The ANPRM of January 23, 1985, requested comments on the possibility ofrequiring additional, more stringent employee safety and health standardsgoverning activities by employees of commerical motor carriers (50 FR 2998).Activities include those that are customarily performed in, on, or aboutcommerical motor vehicles, including but not limited to the operation,maintenance, loading and unloading of those motor vehicles. Sixteen commenters wrote concerning employee safety and health standards.Comments were received from 8 associations connected with the interstatemotor carrier industry, 2 State agencies, 5 motor carriers, and 1 safetyconsulting firm. Two commenters believe that additional employee safety and health requirementsare not needed. One association emphasized that there should be a differencein the standards for large and small motor carriers. A large motor carrieremphasized that any safety standards for freight handlers and mechanicsshould be different from the ones for drivers. A labor union indicatedthat the employee safety and health standards should be expanded and shouldinclude exposure limits for toxic gases, and noise protection equal tothat of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) HearingConservation Amendment, and standards on whole-body vibration.Four commenters objected to the definition of employee as found in theANPRM. These commenters want it emphasized that independent contractorsare included in the definition of employee for the purposes of the FMCSRsonly. The commenters believe that it is important to retain the distinctionbetween independent contractors and employees for purposes of Federal regulation.Another association objects to the definition of ``employer'' because itincludes any person engaged in a business affecting interstate commerce.The association believes that this goes against Congress' intent that intrastatemotor carrier operations not be subject to the Act. Four commenters wrote in support of the FHWA being the lead agency in thepromulgation and administration of employee safety and health standardsfor motor carrier operations. They want jurisdiction in this area to beentirely in the hands of the Department of Transportation and not the OSHA.A labor union and a large motor carrier believe that the FHWA should havejurisdiction for employee safety and health in the area of the driver andvehicle, and the OSHA should have this jurisdiction in the motor carrierworkplace.In the Act, Congress expressed an interest in the health and safety ofindividuals engaged in the operation of commercial motor vehicles. Section220 of the Act requires the Secretary, in consultation with the Directorof the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) andthe Secretary of Labor, to undertake a study of significant health hazardsto which employees engaged in the operation of commercial motor vehiclesare exposed. The study was to include findings regarding the most appropriatemethod for regulating and protecting the health of operators of commercialmotor vehicles.The report to Congress, entitled ``Occupational Health Hazards SignificantlyAffecting Employees Engaged in the Operation of Commercial Motor VehiclesPursuant to section 220, Motor Carrier Safety Act of 1984,'' was preparedby the Department of Transportation's Federal Highway Administration inconsultation with the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health(NIOSH) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). Thereport was forwarded to the Congress on May 19, 1988. In this report, theDOT focused on safety issues, i.e., accidents and NIOSH concentrated onhealth hazards. The OSHA's contribution consisted of an analysis of datagathered during the inspection program administered by that agency. The major findings emerging from the safety portion of the study are groupedaccording to whether they are traffic or nontraffic related accidents andinjuries. First, the chief findings for traffic accidents are: (1) Trafficaccidents are the leading occupational cause of serious injury and deathfor commercial vehicle operators, although they are not the most frequentsafety hazard faced by these drivers; (2) the fatality rate per mile oftravel for medium and heavy truck occupants is less than the fatality ratefor automobile occupants; (3) truck drivers have a higher fatality ratethan other major industries except mining and quarrying; (4) although mostaccidents involving medium and heavy trucks are multiple vehicle accidents,most drivers are killed in single vehicle accidents; (5) for occupantsof combination unit vehicles, overturns and collisions with a fixed objectare the most frequently cited event in fatal accidents; and (6) total orpartial ejection from the vehicle is involved in over one-third of allcombination unit truck occupant fatalities. The major findings for nontraffic related accidents and injuries are: (1)Over 75 percent of all injuries are caused by either overexertion, beingstruck by an object, falls, or being caught in or under some object; and(2) most of these kinds of accidents occur during loading or unloadingoperations or while getting in or out of a vehicle.In terms of mitigating or eliminating these safety hazards, the conclusionreached in the DOT analysis is that most of the safety problems encounteredin the motor carrier industry are either already regulated by the FederalHighway Administration's Office of Motor Carriers or the National HighwayTraffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), or they are not amenable to regulatorysolutions within the authority of the DOT. In the past few years, the DOThas launched several new programs aimed at reducing accidents. Regardinghealth hazards, the NIOSH input to the report is concerned almost exclusivelywith defining and identifying the major health hazards faced by operatorsof commerical vehicles, and the potential health problems associated withthese hazards. Truck and bus drivers appear to be subject to an excessiverisk of developing stomach, back, and respiratory problems as well as anoverrepresentation of deaths and disabilities caused by certain types ofcancer. The NIOSH goes on to identify areas where research has commencedand indicates where more research is needed. <T3>Status: </T3>It has been determined that no further action is necessaryat this time and Part 399 is considered to be reissued pursuant to theAct.<ITAG tagnum="20">(49 U.S.C. app. 2505; 49 U.S.C. 3102; 49 CFR 1.48)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 49 CFR Parts 385, 386, 390 through 396, 398, and399</ITAG>Motor carriers, Driver requirements, Driving motor vehicles, Parts andaccessories, Accident reporting, Hours of service, Inspection, repair,and maintenance, Migrant workers, Employee safety and health.<ITAG tagnum="20">(Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program Number 20.217, MotorCarrier Safety)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Issued on: February 9, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Robert E.
