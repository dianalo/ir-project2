German merchants are enjoying a holiday boom,fueled by 16.6 million eastern Germans hungry for consumer productsafter decades of deprivation.   Shoppers have been standing a dozen deep at German cashregisters this Christmas season, elbowing and pushing their way tosnatch up everything from expensive video recorders to chocolateSantas.   In a weekend report, the German retailers' association estimatedChristmas sales in the united Germany at $18 billion. Nearly 70percent of the stores surveyed reported sales were up thisChristmas season compared with last year, although no percentage ofincrease was given.   There is ``an overwhelmingly positive mood in the retailstores,'' the Association of German Retailers said.   Overall retail sales in Germany for the entire year are expectedto reach $465 billion, up a hefty 12 percent from 1989. The annualfigure will be a post-war record.   The figures tell only part of the story. Beyond that are packedstores, harried sales clerks and streets filled with shoppers.   In downtown Berlin, shoppers from eastern Germany and EasternEurope are snapping up everything in sight.   ``We don't have it,'' say sales clerks fielding dozens ofdemands. ``Oh, that's been sold out for a long time.''   Watches, computer and electronics products and toys are theleading sellers. Jewelry and other big-ticket items are often inhot demand as well.   Berlin's grocery stores are having a hard time keeping suppliesin stock of Christmas baking staples such as almonds and raisins.   Berlin's Tagesspiegel newspaper said Sunday the city wasenjoying ``the sales of a century.''   The Tagesspiegel reported that Berlin would see a 30 percentjump in sales compared with last year. That would be arecord-breaking increase.   Richard Hennig, the manager of one huge Hertie department store,told the newspaper that ``hardly any department'' has been left outof the Christmas sales rush.   Just how long the good times in Germany can go on remains to beseen. Recessions are looming in the United States and Britain, twoof Germany's big export markets.   Many financial experts are predicting an overall economicslowdown next year, as the full costs of German unification hit thecountry's manufacturers and consumers. The countries reunited onOct. 3.   But for now, the buying frenzy is unabated.   In Berlin's far western section of Staaken, close to former EastGermany, a mother went to a Woolworth store back in November tosearch for a Barbie doll accessory for her daughter's Christmasstocking.   ``We don't have that because all the people from eastern Germanyare coming over and buying everything up,'' the store clerk said ashe dashed from one customer to another.   Store detectives are being kept busy, too, by an increase inshoplifting. A sign in the window of one store in Berlin's Spandaudistrict said the rise in theft had been ``catastrophic.''   The demand is also swamping the huge German mail-order houses,which pride themselves on promptly filling customers' orders.   Some customers of the Otto catalogue store have been gettingletters saying that the high number of orders ``from East andWest'' have slowed delivery. The house said that as a result, itcould not keep its usual promise of deliveries in time forChristmas.</TEXT></DOC>
