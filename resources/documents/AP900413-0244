(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Nabisco Brands plans to sell its pet snacksdivision, which makes Milk Bones dog biscuits, to concentrate onmaking ``human foods,'' a company official confirmed Friday.   John Manfredi, a senior vice president of the RJR Nabisco Inc.subsidiary, said the decision was announced to employees Thursday.The company had not yet received any offers, he said.   The pet snacks division employs about 275 people at a plant inBuffalo and 12 at a kennel in Sherburne, 40 miles southeast ofSyracuse, where its products are tested. Those jobs should not bein jeopardy, Manfredi said.   ``Our assumption is that anyone who buys that Milk Bonesbusiness will certainly want to keep it going,'' he said in atelephone interview from his home in Montville, N.J. ``It's a veryprofitable business.''   The pet snacks division had about $150 million in sales lastyear. Its profits were not disclosed separately from Nabisco's,Manfredi said. The division makes a variety of Milk Bones brandbiscuits, such as ones formulated to curb tartar buildup on dogs'teeth.   Nabisco decided to sell the division because it was not a``strategic fit'' with the rest of its business, he said.   ``Their business is all in the human foods area,'' he said.``This is the only one that's not.''   Since RJR Nabisco was bought out for $24.53 billion by KohlbergKravis Roberts andamp; Co. last year, the company has sold numerousassets to reduce debt.   Among other assets, the company has sold five European foodbusinesses for $2.5 billion; its Chun King division for $52million; its Associated Biscuits International Ltd. for $44million; Del Monte fresh fruit operations for $875 million; and DelMonte's canned food business for $1.48 billion.   In a related move Friday, Nabisco said it plans to disband the12-member sales force of its Nabisco Foods division, headquarteredin Parsippany, N.J., which had included the pet snacks operation.Manfredi said the company believes sales could be handled moreefficiently by independent brokers than by in-house salesmen.   The majority of the sales force likely will take jobs with thosebrokers, who already handle about 70 percent of the company'ssales, Manfredi said. Others might take jobs elsewhere at RJR, andfew would be left without a job.</TEXT></DOC>
