Other sources such as solar and fusion energies are yet tobe proved technologically and socio-economically and cannot be reliedon in a rational planning for the future. Nuclear energy generated inLiquid metal fast breeder reactors is technologically proven, presentminimum adverse effects, is economically competitive today, and has thecapacity to supply all the electric power for centuries based on domesticresources. The nuclear community has the responsability to formulateand execute a program for technology development as soon as possibleand to communicate to the people the necessity and merits of nuclearenergy.</TEXT></DOC>
