<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-80-0182 </DOCNO><TEXT>We study the scaling behaviour of lattice quantum chromodynamics by comparingthe {beta} dependence of the string tension and the 0/sup ++/ glueballmass. We use a source method at {beta} = 5.7, {beta} = 5.9 and {beta}= 6.1, on lattices from 9/sup 3/.24 to 16/sup 3/.32. Assuming a stringtension of about (420 MeV)/sup 2/, the lattice spacing ranges from 0.16to 0.08 fm. In order to separate finite volume from scaling violationeffects we have compared data from lattices having approximately thesame overall physical size at the different values of {beta}. We finddeviations from scaling to be very small.</TEXT></DOC>
