Two of these, general sensitivity to DNaseI digestion and association of active genes with the nuclear matrix,do not appear to be directly related in the case of the chicken ovalbumingene. Binding of the active ovalbumin gene to the nuclear matrix occursboth in the 5'-flanking region and within the gene itself. The authorspropose that nuclear matrix binding in regions external to and withinthe gene might occur by different mechanisms.</TEXT></DOC>
