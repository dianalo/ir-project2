York gun.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  WHAT DID $2 TRILLION BUY IN '80S? DUDS  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     The Pentagon in the '80s launched many more weapons programs than couldever be supported in later budgets, former top Pentagon officials say --resulting in a painful legacy of technical problems, delays and a few outrightcancellations. In some cases, weapons were out of date by the time they werebuilt; in others, there wasn't enough money to complete what had been started.Items:;    B-2 bomber -- After investing more than $23 billion, the Air Forcehas just two airplanes that can fly. The cost of the planes has increased sofast that the Pentagon has been forced to stretch out the production schedule,driving the price up even further. Similarly, the C-17 appears to be headedfor a massive cost overrun.;    B-1 bomber -- The $28 billion fleet isgrounded because of jet engine problems, the latest in a series of technicalwoes.;    Star wars -- The Pentagon has spent an estimated $20 billion and isnowhere near deploying any of the lasers or energy beams of the StrategicDefense Initiative that were conceived to defend the nation against an enemymissile attack.;    P-7 patrol plane -- The Department of Defense was forcedto cancel the Navy's P-7 and the Army's Sgt. York anti-aircraft gun when thecost for each began to spiral out of control and questions were raised aboutwhether they could accomplish their missions.;    A-12 plane canceled; Clearly, Monday's cancellation of the A-12 attack plane -- which represented adirect loss to taxpayers of $3.1 billion, the money invested by the Navy inthe failed effort -- was hardly an isolated case.;    &quot;For whatever reason,the fact that so many contracts are in default at so many defense corporationscould be a national disaster in the long run,&quot; said Donald Hicks, formerundersecretary of defense. &quot;We have a terribly poor acquisition system.&quot;;   If a war erupts in the Persian Gulf, the Air Force plans to use B-52 bombersdesigned in the 1950s to massively bomb Iraq, even though both the B-1 and B-2bombers were promoted as having important capabilities for conventionalwarfare. Indeed, few of the programs undertaken in the 1980s will make weaponsavailable for use in a conflict anytime soon.;    Many experts foresaw earlyin the 1980s that the Pentagon's acquisition plans were fundamentally flawed.By some estimates, it would have required annual defense budgets of $500billion to $600 billion to buy all the weapons that were started early in theReagan era, far short of the $288 billion budget this year.;    Programs onstarvation diet;  When the buildup peaked in 1985 and the budget began todecline, the response was not to kill some programs to preserve the health ofthe remainder, but rather to put everything on a starvation diet.;    &quot;Therewere warning signs as early as 1982 or 1983, but those people who raised themwere branded as disloyal,&quot; said Lawrence Korb, former assistant secretary ofdefense. &quot;People did not want to face up to the implications. Other than theNavy ships, we didn't really increase the force structure of the country.&quot;;   The Navy set a goal of having 600 ships, but funds ran out by the time theservice had 580. Now, it is mothballing ships at a rapid clip to save moneyand envisions having a fleet of just 483 by 1995, Korb said.;    &quot;We got lessthan what we bargained for,&quot; said Robert Costello, former undersecretary ofdefense for acquisition. &quot;We started with way too many programs than we wouldever have been able to successfully bring to a conclusion under any of thebudget scenarios. And when a report saying so was leaked to the WashingtonPost, (then-Secretary of Defense Caspar) Weinberger ordered his top deputiesto undergo lie detector tests.&quot;;    Weinberger, now publisher of Forbesmagazine, could not be reached for comment Tuesday.;    Reagan administrationofficials calculated that Congress would not go along with a massive increasein defense spending unless the Pentagon cracked down on seemingly wastefulpurchasing practices and got tough about contractor abuses.;    Defenseindustry backlash;  &quot;Weinberger was fed up with the defense industry becausehe was convinced that it was undermining his whole defense buildup with its$500 hammers and toilet seats,&quot; Costello said. &quot;The defense industry did notclean up its act, which led to the backlash&quot; -- primarily fixed-pricecontracts, reduced profit  margins and tighter payment schedules.;    &quot;But thegovernment shot itself in the foot,&quot; Costello said. &quot;The way we spent themoney and ran the contracts, we  put the defense industry into shambles.&quot;;   For all the warning signs, money was so abundant during the early 1980s thatno task seemed too big -- even the Strategic Defense Initiative that wouldshield America from missiles with giant orbiting lasers or energy beams.;   &quot;There were a tremendous number of false starts and tremendous overhead&quot; inthe $20 billion star wars program, said John Pike, director of the spacepolicy project at the Federation of American Scientists. &quot;When the program wasannounced, one was left with the impression that we would have somethingdeployed by now.&quot;;    Michael Rich, a vice president at Rand Corp., said that,although the procurement system was repeatedly reformed during the 1980s --with such requirements as warranties on products -- little improvementoccurred in the fundamental methods by which the Pentagon acquired weaponssystems.;    &quot;The changes never went to the heart of the problem,&quot; Rich said.;   Defenders of the buildup say that the $2 trillion Pentagon budget duringthe 1980s played a key role in ending the Cold War, though many experts saythat the Cold War was bound to end with Soviet economic collapse in anyevent.;    Price of peace?;  &quot;What did we get? Peace,&quot; said RonaldHertenstein, research director for Forecast Associates, a defense industrymarket research company. &quot;Nobody can say what the price of peace should havebeen. We have paid a whole lot more in past years and failed to get peace. Wehave a different world order now.&quot;;    But the way in which the transition wasmanaged gives the Pentagon and the defense industry little to be proud of, onecongressional staff member said Tuesday.;    &quot;We got into a spending war withthe Soviet Union and we were able to spend them into bankruptcy beforeourselves,&quot; said the aide, who in line with Washington custom declined to beidentified.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Los Angeles Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910109  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  1,137  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday, January 9, 199100009229,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  0  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENGFRONT  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
