<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-37-0424 </DOCNO><TEXT>The paper describes design and performance of a variable speed drive consistingof a novel synchronous motor with field excitation by samarium cobaltmagnets and a load commutated inverter. The rating of the six pole synchronousmotor is 160 kW at 3600 rpm. The radially oriented magnets are mountedon the surface of the rotor. A cylindrical damper encloses the rotorconstruction to make possible load commutation. The motor was designedby means of numerical field calculation. The steady state and start upperformance was investigated by digital simulation. In the paper somedesign parameters, simulation and test results, e.g. the motor efficiency,are presented.</TEXT></DOC>
