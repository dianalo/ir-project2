This lever is supposed to somehow reduceinterest rates and that lever will prevent Congress andGeorge Bush from falling into the abyss of a $165 billiondeficit. It makes for grand political theater, but we doubtthere'd be any need to stage this show if early last NovemberSenate Majority Leader George Mitchell hadn't personallykilled a cut in the capital-gains tax.   We'll describe in a moment the contributions we think acapital-gains cut would have made to the economy, which somefear has turned soft. But let's look back at how theWashington establishment dealt with the capital-gains cut ithad in hand, and rejected, last fall.</LP><TEXT>   For starters, the same part of the Beltway establishmentthat is most eager now to cure a recession with a taxincrease is the same group that ridiculed a capital-gains cutas only a tax-giveaway to &quot;the rich.&quot; No one was more ardentin criticizing the capital-gains proposal from thisclass-based position than Senator Mitchell.   Against this view, others of us argued at the time thatthe main purpose of such a cut was to continue the economicexpansion of the previous eight years by giving capital anincentive to move toward its most efficient uses, consistingof the ideas and work of other Americans. A majority of theHouse Ways and Means Committee supported the cut, and about60 Senators, including Finance Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, werebehind the idea. On some days Dan Rostenkowski has beenwilling to support it. The President was ready to sign thebill.   In the end, Senator Mitchell stood against all theseforces. &quot;This is for me]&quot; he told his Senate colleagues. Soout of deference to their new majority leader, the Democratslet capital gains die.   It is now seven months later. Federal tax receipts arecoming in below projections, partly because a slowing economyhas held down corporate profits. Smaller borrowers, such asstart-up firms, are hard-pressed to find capital, asfrightened lenders overreact to pressure from the Sandamp;L bailoutinspectors. The stock market drifts in a &quot;trading range&quot; asmany shareowners simply sit on their holdings; anti-takeoverlaws and sentiment also lock up shares.   In retrospect, a capital-gains cut last November lookslike it would have been a pretty good deal. No one disputesits significant first-year boost to revenues. Even if youbelieve that the later revenue impact may be more modest, itseems clear that a lower capital-gains rate would expand thetax base as investors continued to take taxable profits.   In turn, most of those profits would have been reinvestedin the hope of further gains, and some of those investmentssurely would have flowed to the smaller, cutting-edge firmsthat are now being told to get lost by bankers clamping downon credit. Perhaps not coincidentally, the job-growth figureshave gone flat.   By freeing up capital, a gains cut also would havealleviated the increasing political pressure the FederalReserve is now under to single-handedly guarantee theeconomy's health. The Fed's primary role is to controlinflation. By freezing the fiscal side, Mitchellnomicsshifted the burden back to the Fed. And in fact the Fed easedin December, with Wayne Angell dissenting. Add to this thatCongress is still trying to mandate the uses of capital byenacting a $27 billion Clean Air Bill, parental-leave andchild-care bills.   We are not trying here to overstate the effects of acapital-gains differential; it obviously doesn't solve allthe world's economic ills or relieve policy makers of theirresponsibilities, such as controlling spending. Its purposeis to free capital to seek its most productive uses, which ofcourse is why so few countries other than our own tax capitalgains as we do, if at all. The fact remains that SenatorMitchell's defeat of the capital-gains cut was a mistake,which is the reason for the fourth installment in thisseries, &quot;The Mitchell Recession?&quot; A full recession isn'there, but the Mitchell slowdown is, with falling governmentreceipts.   By all reports, the congressional coalition for acapital-gains cut is intact, and no one is disputing that itwould add significant revenue in its first year. Thiscertainly should be part of any deal the White House nowstrikes with Congress. Indeed, the goal is sufficientlyworthwhile that it shouldn't be held hostage to any biggerdeal. Senator Mitchell and his supporters in the Democraticparty are free to fight the cut solely in class-warfare termsif they so choose. But the rest of us are also free to arguethat the real issue is unlocking capital for productiveinvestments, and to the extent Mr. Mitchell continues tothwart that process, he should be prepared to get blamed forthe consequences of an opportunity that was lost lastNovember.</TEXT></DOC>
