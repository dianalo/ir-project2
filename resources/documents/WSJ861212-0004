The average ended the day down 9.28 points at 1923.65. The decline would have been sharper were it not for a nearly seven-point gain in the price of Owens-Illinois stock, a component of the average.    The gain by Owens-Illinois put the industrial average on higher ground in early trading, but selling related to stock index futures soon sent the average the other way. At 10:30 a.m. EST, the blue chip indicator was up more than seven points. An hour later, it was down more than 15 points.    In the broader market, declining New York Stock Exchange issues swamped advancers, 1,181 to 440. Volume slipped to 136 million shares from 139.7 million Wednesday.    Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index fell 2.79 to 248.17, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index retreated 1.44 to 142.02.    Traders said the market was plagued by uncertainty over next week's expiration of stock index futures and options and by concern over what will happen next in both the insider trading and Iran arms sales scandals.    Sliding bond prices also contributed to the stock price decline. Among the Dow Jones averages, the interest-sensitive utility index recorded the biggest percentage decline. It fell 2.19 points, or 1.03%, to 210.04.    Jack Baker, head of capital commitment at Shearson Lehman Brothers, said institutions were taking profits in utility issues. In addition, there were indications of tax-related selling by individual investors.    Traders said both institutional and individual investors are hesitant to buy stocks in advance of the expirations a week from today. Mr. Baker said he wouldn't be surprised to see record trading volume and a &quot;75-point move&quot; either way by the Dow Jones Industrial Average during a single session between now and the expirations.    Sandamp;P, meanwhile, said it expects market volatility to increase next year. But it also believes that investors willing to put up with the erratic movements will be rewarded.    In its latest newsletter to be mailed to subscribers during the weekend, Sandamp;P's Outlook predicts the Sandamp;P 500-stock index will rise more than 10% from current levels, to 275 to 280. An equivalent rise would put the Dow Jones Industrial Average at 2100 to 2150.    The newsletter said the move would be propelled by a combination of upward market momentum, large amounts of money available for stock investment, and the absence of strong competition from other types of investments.    Sandamp;P's analysts and investment policy committee favor the following stock groups in 1987: chemicals, book publishing, health care, property-casualty insurance, pollution control, savings and loans, semiconductors and retailing.    November retail sales -- excluding those of automobiles -- showed the best monthly gain since July 1985, but retailing stocks continued to come under pressure yesterday. J.C. Penney was down 1 3/8 to 76 1/4, and Sears Roebuck was off 3/4 to 41 1/2. Elsewhere, F.W. Woolworth dropped 7/8 to 41 1/8, and Supermarkets General fell 3/4 to 25 1/2, despite announcements of expansion plans by both companies.    The 6 3/4-point surge in Owens-Illinois, to 51, came on news that a company formed by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts wants to acquire the firm for $55 a share in cash and securities. The glass and forest products concern said it appointed a special committee of outside directors to consider the proposal.    CBI Industries climbed 3 to 30 in active trading. GAF said it bought a 9.9% stake and intends to file for permission to purchase more. GAF was unchanged at 40 1/2.    Culbro rose 1/4 to 55 3/4 after gaining more than five points in the previous two sessions. On Tuesday, the company set a special distribution to shareholders of $12.84 a share. &quot;It's a good deal for everyone concerned,&quot; said Robert Willens, a corporate tax specialist at accountants Peat Marwick Mitchell.    Mr. Willens said the distribution will be treated as capital gains and return of capital to individual shareholders and as a dividend to corporate shareholders. Since the distribution will be paid Dec. 29, individual shareholders can take advantage of the lower tax on long-term capital gains just before it ends. Corporate shareholders, meanwhile, can exempt 85% of their dividend income from federal taxes this year. Next year the corporate exemption will drop to 80%.    Stocks of the regional Bell companies headed lower. Among them, Ameritech dropped 2 1/8 to 135 1/4, Southwestern Bell was down 2 1/8 to 112 7/8, and Nynex lost 1 1/8 to 65 3/4. American Telephone andamp; Telegraph is seeking to have the Federal Communications Commission replace the Justice Department in reviewing which businesses the regional Bells can enter. The regionals view the move as an attempt to slow their entry into businesses of interest to ATandamp;T. ATandamp;T stock fell 1/2 to 26 3/4 in heavy trading.    Oil prices rose yesterday, but many oil and oil service stocks went the other way.    Schlumberger fell 1 3/4 to 32 1/2 in active trading. It said it would take a charge of about $1.7 billion in the fourth quarter, most of it related to oil field services.    Pennzoil skidded 4 5/8 to 68 1/2. The Texas appeals court hearing Texaco's appeal of Pennzoil's $11 billion judgment typically publishes opinions on Thursdays, although the decision potentially could be issued any day of the week. The lack of a decision yesterday might have led to profit-taking by speculators betting on Pennzoil.    In the over-the-counter market, the Nasdaq OTC composite index fell 1.32 to 357.73 as volume rose to 123.8 million shares from 115.2 million Wednesday. Declining issues led advancers, 1,239 to 825.    MCI Communications was the most active over-the-counter stock, rising 1/8 to 7 1/2 on volume of just under four million shares. Pulitzer Publishing, a new issue, closed at 28 3/4, up 1 1/4 from its offering price.    GTECH rose 1 1/8 to 23 1/4. The company said it expects to receive an $11 million order for terminals from California's lottery commission. </TEXT></DOC>
