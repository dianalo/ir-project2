The nomination comes in the nick of time. Someone sensible in Washington has to deal with the insider-trading legislation being proposed by members of Congress who know more about getting headlines than about preserving efficient markets. Mr. Ruder looks as if he'll be up to the task.    The White House decided on someone who knows how markets work instead of a gung-ho prosecutor. Mr. Ruder, who has taught corporate law for 25 years, has criticized the SEC for trying to expand the meaning of insider trading without the benefit of any statutory definition. Mr. Ruder's first task on the job should be to stop an insider-trading bill that, coincidentally, was introduced yesterday.    Congress wants to define insider trading. It has come to believe, correctly, that this is preferable to the current practice of prosecuting people for undefined crimes. The problem is that no definition is probably better than the the one proposed by Sens. Al D'Amato (R., N.Y.) and Donald Riegle (D., Mich.).    The bill is the product of a committee headed by former SEC lawyer Harvey Pitt, which was charged by Sen. Riegle with drafting a definition. The law would make it a crime for anyone to &quot;use material, nonpublic information&quot; to buy or sell stock &quot;if such person knows or is reckless in not knowing that such information has been obtained wrongfully.&quot;    The key is wrongfully, defined as information obtained by &quot;theft, conversion, misappropriation or a breach of any fiduciary, contractual, employment, personal or other relationship of trust and confidence.&quot;    This definition would not draw a clear standard of right and wrong. It would be litigation fodder for years. For example, what does misappropriation mean? The nominated SEC chairman has wondered this himself.    Last month Mr. Ruder wrote a letter to Mr. Pitt's definition committee objecting to the vagueness of the &quot;misappropriation theory.&quot; In an interview yesterday, Mr. Ruder instead emphasized to us the need for certainty in this area of the law. He is on strong ground. The Supreme Court, in the Dirks case, agreed that misappropriation was too broad a concept. This issue is inevitably going to be dealt with again when the court this term considers the Winans case.    At congressional hearings on the insider-trading bill yesterday, George Mason Law School Dean Henry Manne made another important point. By defining wrongful trading, the bill by implication -- and probably unintentionally -- means that any other use of information would be legal. Mr. Manne noted that this would let a company &quot;contract out&quot; of insider-trading prohibitions by disclosing publicly that its officers may trade on nonpublic information.    The bill also guarantees litigation by putting a presumption of guilt on anyone accused of insider trading. Say a broker calls and says he's got information about a stock. If you buy the stock, you may have to prove later that it wasn't acquired &quot;wrongfully.&quot; Aside from the constitutional dubiousness of any presumption of guilt, this would chill the markets by encouraging litigation. It wouldn't take long for plaintiff lawyers or prosecutors to see how hard it would be for defendants to prove a negative. The bill also misses when it says the victims are people who sold stock that later went up in price. The sellers got more than they would have if the buyer hadn't had illicit information, so they suffered no loss.    A genuinely useful definition of insider trading is very much needed now, but no mental gymnastics are required to produce it. The common law understands that Ivan Boesky's crime was stealing valuable information from his clients. The way to catch crooks is to define insider trading as the use of stolen information. </TEXT></DOC>
