During the Cabinet session, about 1 million Israeli workersstaged a two-hour strike to protest growing unemployment. About2,000 workers demonstrated outside Shamir's office.   In the occupied West Bank, police reported an Israeli taxidriver was stabbed three times by two Palestinian passengers whofled on foot. Spokesman Shalom Ben Hemo said police wereinvestigating if the crime was tied to the uprising.   Ten Palestinians were wounded in clashes with the army in theoccupied lands, Arab hospital officials said. The army confirmedtwo Palestinians were shot in the West Bank and said it wasinvestigating the other reports.   The PLO-backed underground leaders of the uprising issued aleaflet Sunday that called for an escalation of the revolt andagain dismissed the Shamir plan as an effort to ``gain more timeand more opportunities to assassinate'' the revolt.   The Cabinet vote was worked out as a compromise with VicePremier Shimon Peres, head of the left-leaning Labor Party, whichhad threatened to withdraw from the Likud-led coalition Cabinetover the proposed amendments.   They included postponing the elections until the 19-month-oldPalestinian uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip ends.   The Cabinet, which first approved the plan in May, voted 21-4with one abstention to approve it without the conditions pushed byIndustry Minister Ariel Sharon of Likud and other party hard-liners.   Sharon joined two other Likud members in voting against thecompromise. Another dissenter was Science Minister Ezer Weizman ofLabor, who criticized the plan for not urging peace talks betweenIsrael and the Palestine Liberation Organization.   Emerging from the four-hour Cabinet session, Peres said thedecision was something ``we can live with.''   ``If the peace initiative is the only guiding line of thegovernment, we shall stay in the government,'' Peres toldreporters. ``Today we clarified there is just one guideline.''   Labor's threat to topple Israel's 8-month-old government came onJuly 12, a week after the hard-line demands were tacked onto thepeace plan at a Likud Central Committee meeting.   The Israeli peace plan, first approved by the Cabinet on May 14,calls for the 1.7 million Palestinians in the West Bank and GazaStrip to elect representatives to negotiate with Israel on limitedself-rule in the territories.   It calls for later negotiations on the final status of theoccupied territories.   The Likud on July 5 voted to delay any elections until thePalestinian uprising against Israeli rule in the territories hasended. It also said the 140,000 Palestinians in east Jerusalemshould be excluded from the vote. Israel annexed east Jerusalem aspart of its capital after its capture from Jordan in the 1967Middle East War.   The hard-line conditions prompted denunciations by the PLO andcriticism from the United States, which has been trying to persuadethe Palestinians to accept the election plan.   Sunday's statement made no reference to those conditions. Itsaid:   ``The peace initiative as approved by the government on May 14and brought before Parliament is hereby approved, stands as it is,and is valid and exists without any changes or amendments.   ``The government continues to operate and will operate inaccordance with the peace initiative which obligates the members ofgovernment as it was accepted.''   Israel radio reported Weizman, a former defense minister, toldSunday's closed-door session that he rejected the Shamir planbecause ``if we want peace, we have to talk to the PLO.''   Israel refuses to talk to the PLO.   The Cabinet also voted Sunday to add $75 million to the defensebudget for battling the uprising.   At least 518 Palestinians have been killed as a result ofIsraeli actions in the uprising, and another 83 have been slain byPalestinians who accused them of collaborating with Israel.Thirty-seven Israelis have died in the revolt.</TEXT></DOC>
