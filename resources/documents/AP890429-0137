The two photo giants go into court Monday to determine how manyhundreds of millions of dollars Eastman Kodak Co. will have to payfor violating seven of Polaroid Corp.'s patents on instant film andcameras.   Legions of high-priced lawyers are expected to present evidencefor four to six months before Judge A. David Mazzone reaches adecision in U.S. District Court here. But the stakes are so highthat neither side is trying to pinch mere millions in legal fees.   Whether Kodak illegally copied Polaroid's technology is nolonger an issue. A judge ruled in October 1985 that it had _ andbooted Kodak out of the instant photography business, saddling itwith $600 million of losses and an estimated $200 million worth ofuseless manufacturing equipment.   The only issue in the trial that starts Monday is how much Kodakmust pay its rival.   Rochester, N.Y.-based Kodak argues that the most Polaroid shouldget is $177 million, representing a 5 percent royalty on all theinstant film and cameras that Kodak sold from 1976 to 1986.   But Cambridge-based Polaroid is asking for $3.48 billion to$3.96 billion for lost profits and missed business opportunities,plus punitive damages and interest, for a total of $11.88 billion.   If Polaroid gets anything close to that amount, it will be thelargest patent infringement award in history and a devastating blowto Kodak, which had operating profits of $3 billion on sales of $17billion last year.   A multibillion dollar verdict could force Kodak to make layoffs,take on huge debt and sell subsidiaries to raise cash. It couldleave the company unable to make the investments it needs tocompete with Japanese film brands like Fuji and Ilford.   If the award is near the top of the possible range, it couldeven force Kodak into a Chapter 11 bankruptcy, just as Texaco wasforced to reorganize when a jury ordered it to pay $10.3 billion toPennzoil four years ago.   But securities analysts say that is unlikely. Most Wall Streetbrokerage houses are predicting an award of about $1 billion, andtraders say the stock prices of both companies already reflect thatexpectation.   ``We're not going to see another Texaco here,'' said PeterEnderlin, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co.   Polaroid, which recently spent $1.1 billion to buy back stockand fend off a hostile takeover by Shamrock Holdings Inc., isexpected to use part of any award to lower its corporate debt.   In addition, Polaroid made the lawsuit a bargaining chip in thetakeover fray, promising in its March 27 settlement with Shamrockthat stockholders would get part of any award over $750 millionafter taxes.   That payout, to be made through dividends or stock repurchases,would be on a sliding scale: at least a quarter of any post-taxaward from $750 million to $1.2 billion, a third of the amount from$1.2 billion to $2.4 billion, and half of everything above $2.4billion.   But Polaroid's stockholders are not the only ones who would gainfrom a big verdict. Its 11,000 employees would, too. Theirprofit-sharing plan entitles them to about 10 percent of any awardfor lost profits, and their employee stock ownership plan meansthey gain from any rise in share prices.   If the verdict comes in below the expected range, however,Polaroid's employees and stockholders could get hurt.   Alex Henderson, an analyst with Prudential Bache SecuritiesInc., said that ``as a rough rule of thumb,'' Polaroid's stockprice probably will rise or fall about $1 for every $100 million ofthe award that is above or below Wall Street's expectations.   That means a $400 million verdict could knock $5 or $6 off thestock's current price of about $38 per share, while a $2 billionaward could add $10.   Kodak has had two years to prepare for an adverse judgment andalready has weathered a lot of the instant photography storm. Lastyear, for example, it gave $150 million in cash and merchandise ascompensation to owners of its instant cameras, for which film is nolonger available.   Polaroid, meanwhile, emerged from its takeover battle infighting trim, with 1,900 fewer employees, lower overhead andseveral new products _ including conventional film, a foray intoKodak's terrain that seems an appropriate tit-for-tat.   Now it remains to be seen who will prevail in court.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Mon AMs, May 1</NOTE></DOC>
