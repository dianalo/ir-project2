Howe Institute, a Toronto economicresearch group. It will ensure that the Bank of Canada'scurrent commitment to price stability &quot;doesn't disappear witha change of government or a change of governor.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The proposal was part of a broad package of governmentmeasures to strengthen various federal institutions and todeal with the constitutional grievances of Quebec and others.   The Bank of Canada is considered by many economists to beamong the most determined central banks in fightinginflation. The Bank of Canada's targets include slowing theyear-to-year rise in the consumer price index to 2% by theend of 1995. Thereafter the objective would be furtherreductions in inflation until zero inflation is achieved. Inthe three months ended Aug. 31, the consumer price index roseat an annual rate of 3.2%.   Manufacturers' associations and others who have beencritical of the Bank of Canada's tough monetary policy saidthey wanted to study the proposed change before commenting onit. Peter Drake, senior economist for Toronto Dominion Bank,questioned the need for the mandate change, saying that theBank of Canada already has a &quot;fairly balanced&quot; mandate. &quot;Ifyou assign the job of fighting inflation specifically to theBank of Canada, you are in effect taking that responsibilityoff the shoulders of the people who run fiscal policy,&quot; hesaid.   Some other countries, including Austria and New Zealand,also have amended their central bank laws to include pricestability in central bank mandates. Germany's Bundesbank alsohas a statutory obligation to fight inflation.   The Canadian government said that in the future it willconsult with provincial and territorial governments beforemaking appointments to the Bank of Canada's board. Thisdecision is expected to strengthen the central bank'srelations with various regions of the country. Some provinceshave attacked the Bank of Canada for allowing the Canadiandollar to rise to near a 13-year high against its U.S.counterpart. The Canadian dollar closed yesterday at 88.19U.S. cents, up from 88.17 cents Monday.   The government also proposed that Canada's bill of rights,the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, should be amended toguarantee property rights. The amendment has been urged bythe real estate industry to provide property owners with astronger legal defense against potentially costly zoningchanges and other property infringements. Zoning in Canada is&quot;used almost without thought by local governments to, ineffect, impose taxes,&quot; said Michael Walker, executivedirector of the Fraser Institute, a conservative researchgroup.   As expected, the government proposed recognizing Quebecconstitutionally as a &quot;distinct society&quot; within Canada. TheQuebec government has demanded such a provision to helpprotect the province's French language and culture.   The government's plan will be submitted today to a specialparliamentary committee, which will hold hearings across thecountry and report back to the government by late February.Most of the government's constitutional proposals could beenacted with the support of seven provinces representing 50%of the country's population. A proposed change to theconstitutional amending formula would need the consent of allprovinces.</TEXT></DOC>
