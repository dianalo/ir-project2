The rebels say the armed forces and authorities of the rightistgovernment-elect are increasing repression in preparation for a``total war'' against suspected leftists.   Alfredo Cristiani, who was elected president last month andtakes office June 1, and U.S. Ambassador William Walker made theircomments during separate meetings Wednesday with foreigncorrespondents.   Their analyses came shortly after the assassination of AttorneyGeneral Roberto Garcia Alvarado when a bomb placed on the roof ofhis Jeep Cherokee exploded while the vehicle was stopped at atraffic light.   Any increase in rights abuses by the armed forces and the newgovernment, both men said, would be used by guerrilla supporters inthe United States to lobby for a cutoff in vital U.S. aid to ElSalvador.   ``They (the guerrillas) are not going to achieve that,'' saidCristiani, leader of the rightist Republican Nationalist Alliance,or Arena.   Arena and the U.S. Embassy have blamed the rebel Farabundo MartiNational Liberation Front for three assassinations sincemid-February and for the bombing Friday of the house of FranciscoMerino, the vice president-elect.   One person was slightly injured in the attack on Merino's house.   The guerrillas have claimed responsibility for the recentslayings of Miguel Castellanos, a former rebelcommander-turned-government informer, and Francisco Peccorini, arightist academic.   The insurgents denied responsibility for the bombing of Merino'shouse. There has been no claim of responsibility for Garcia'skilling.   ``The guerrillas are quite obviously attempting to provoke anasty, violent reaction from the government, the elected governmentor the armed forces to their acts of barbarism,'' said Walker.   ``The provocation is coming from one side. They (the rebels) aretrying to drag this place back to the early 1980s,'' he said.   Walker was referring to a period when rightist death squads werekilling hundreds of suspected leftists each month. Local andinternational human rights groups, as well as former U.S.diplomats, link still-active Arena leaders such as RobertoD'Aubuisson to the death squads.   The party denies the allegations.   ``The terrorists are trying to provoke an uncontrolled, vengefulreaction,'' said Cristiani. ``They would then exploit that abroadto politically isolate the new government and cut off aid.''   Several left-of-center labor and rights organizations disagreewith both men's contention that the provocation is coming from oneside only.   ANDES, the biggest teachers' union, has blamed military-linkeddeath squads for the abduction and assassination of two teacherssince late February.   Maria Cristina Gomez, a union and feminist activist, wasabducted by heavily armed civilians as she left school April 5 andshoved into a dark-windowed Jeep Cherokee, witnesses said. Herbullet-riddled body _ the skin of her back and arms peeled away byacid _ was discovered an hour later.   Dark-windowed Jeeps are a sort of trademark vehicle for deathsquads.   Walker said he and other embassy officials have met with Arenaleaders to encourage them to pursue ``a rational, reasonedresponse'' to guerrilla violence.   In a related development, government forces killed an Argentinedoctor and a French nurse who worked with leftist guerrillas, thearmed forces and the rebels said Wednesday.   An armed forces communique identified the foreigners as GustavoIslas Caceres of Argentina and Madelaine Languedoc of France.   Clandestine rebel radio said Islas Caceres, Languedoc, and threeSalvadoran rebels were killed Saturday after being captured duringan army attack on a rebel field hospital in the eastern province ofSan Vicente.   The armed forces said the foreigners were guerrilla fighters whowere killed in combat along with seven Salvadoran rebels.   Walker said the embassy had concluded the foreigners were killedin combat about 30 miles east of the capital.</TEXT></DOC>
