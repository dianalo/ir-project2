The reports contradicted the Afghan government, which saidThursday the Moslem guerrillas had lost a two-week fight to takeKhost.   A spokesman for guerrilla commander Jalaluddin Haqqani, who isreported to lead 3,000 of the U.S.-supported guerrillas, saidThursday they had Khost and were within three miles of it.   The guerrilla news agency MIDIA said the mujahedeen, as theguerrillas are called, destroyed a Soviet-made Antonov-26 transportplane in a rocket attack on the Khost's airport Wednesday.   ``The Kabul regime can only supply by air,'' it said. ``All roadsleading to Khost have been cut off.''   Haqqani's spokesman, who known only as Mohed, said: ``Fifteensoldiers surrendered and handed over some heavy guns'' on Thursday.``Three mujahedeen were killed and 14 were wounded, but we don'tknow how many regime troops were killed.''   He said the guerrillas captured three tanks as they overran fourposts, which he identified as Walim, Ghubao, Mirbao and Bak.   There is no way to verify the contradictory claims often made byAfghan officials and insurgents in the 11-year-old civil war.   Lt. Gen. Abdul Haq Ulumi, secretary of the Soviet-backedgovernment's Supreme Defense Council, told reporters Thursday thearmy had retaken all the positions it had lost since the guerrillasbegan their Khost offensive Aug. 24 and the battle was ``completelyover.''   The town in Paktia province is the government's easternmostgarrison, 12 miles from the Pakistan, where most of the guerrillasare based. Its capture would clear the way for a guerrilla assaulton the provincial capital Gardez, 48 miles to the northwest.   The guerrillas have not captured a city since the Soviet Unionwithdrew its military forces Feb. 15 after nine years of involvementin the war.</TEXT></DOC>
