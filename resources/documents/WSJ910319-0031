But a slow slide in Soviet oil exports has been under wayfor some time, and Mr. Gorbachev's announcement of a cut inexports wasn't unexpected. Still, some analysts and oilmarket-watchers were surprised at how deeply and quickly theSoviets now plan to slash their sales to foreign markets.</LP><TEXT>   Oil strategists who examined Soviet production and exportnumbers say the Soviets are cutting exports by twice as muchas expected. In other words, &quot;the market has anticipatedabout one-half of this loss,&quot; said Kenneth Miller, seniorprincipal for Purvin andamp; Gertz, energy consultants to the oilindustry. &quot;But in a market that has already lost Kuwaiti andIraqi oil production, any additional loss of supply isgreeted with great sensitivity.&quot;   At the beginning of last year, Soviet production stood atabout 11.9 million barrels daily. By year's end, output hadfallen to 10.9 million barrels a day. Mr. Miller said hebelieves that about 2.3 million barrels of that dailyproduction was being exported.   About 65% of the Soviet exports were going to theindustrialized nations of Western Europe, with two of thebiggest consumers being Germany and France. Some Soviet oil,in the form of products, has even made its way into the U.S.market.   World markets will miss the Soviet oil. It is assumed thatMr. Gorbachev's talk of cuts pertains mostly to crude ratherthan to products. If so, soft demand in the second quartershould at least offset the growing losses through the summer.   Philip Verleger, senior fellow at the Institute forInternational Economics, estimated that demand for oilproduced by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countriesduring the period March through June won't exceed 21 millionbarrels a day. But last week's informal agreement among thatgroup's producers made it clear that they will be pumping22.5 million barrels daily at least through June.   &quot;That additional one million to 1.5 million {barrels}should take the sting out of the Soviet decline,&quot; Mr.Verleger said.   As global economies start to perk up, which someeconomists predict will occur by summer, demand could putsome strain on supply. Oil producers, both in OPEC andoutside the organization, have been pumping all-out toreplace Kuwaiti and Iraqi oil production lost since thePersian Gulf crisis broke out last summer. But the call foradditional oil supplies can be expected to also go to OPEC,and particularly to Persian Gulf producers. Plans by SaudiArabia to push production capacity to 10 million barrels aday are advancing, even though the Saudis pledged last weekto cut output somewhat.   Iran is also looking to build its output. And by nextyear, both Kuwait and Iraq are expected to be pumping enoughoil to start re-establishing themselves as exporters.</TEXT></DOC>
