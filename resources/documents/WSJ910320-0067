A typical refund-anticipation loan costs a flat $30 andpays cash to a filer 14 days before direct IRS deposit of therefund in his bank account. On a $916 average refund, that$2.14 a day is an annual interest rate of 85%; even on theusual loan maximum of $3,000, the rate is 26%. And that omitsan electronic-filing fee of $20 or more. Yet &quot;theoverwhelming majority&quot; of electronic filers served by Handamp;RBlock seek the bank loans, says the preparer's Linda Jordan.</LP><TEXT>   Direct deposit takes two to three weeks. Maybe electronicfilers who elect it (80% do) but get loans are too desperateto wait so long. Maybe it's the '90s mood of &quot;instantgratification,&quot; says John Hewitt of Jackson Hewitt TaxService. It arranges bank loans that cost up to $45; heexpects 75% of its clients to take them. Loan statisticsaren't available. Phillip Sbrochi of a leading lender, BankOne, Columbus, Ohio, says it works with 10 filing agents,including Block and Jackson Hewitt, and has had over a 25%rise in loan volume from 1990.   The IRS requires ads to make clear that &quot;48-hour refunds&quot;are loans. The fee mustn't be based on the refund.                                                                                                          ASK YOURSELF this &quot;personal, intimate question,&quot; wrote thetax experts:  &quot;. . . Am I, with the conscience God has givenme to see the right and to do the right, reporting my incomeas my Government is expecting honest men to . . .?&quot; The yearwas 1919. A war had barely ended. The original income-tax lawof 1913 already had been modified four times. The editors ofthe Prentice-Hall Tax Service, grappling with theever-changing law and regulations, introduced a manual inlooseleaf form.   After outlining the law, the editors of the manual (nowpublished by Maxwell McMillan) sat back -- or perhaps leanedforward -- and closed Chapter I with these earnest words: &quot;Itis fair for every man and for every corporation to take everylegitimate advantage of the provisions . . . intended . . .to make the law work equitably. But, in days like theseespecially, every practice designed to evade the spirit ifnot the letter of the law will be condemned by the rank andfile of honest citizens.&quot;                                                                                                          STATES REJOICE in Tennessee's twin court victories overmail-order firms.   Tennessee trial judges in separate suits filed by SaksFifth Avenue's catalog unit, SFA Folio Collections, andBloomingdale's by Mail have held that both firms must collectTennessee's sales tax on wares sent there. &quot;This is abreakthrough -- the first major victory for states&quot; trying tomake out-of-state vendors collect sales taxes, says TennesseeRevenue Commissioner Huddleston. The rulings clash with eightwon in four other states by mail-order firms, the DirectMarketing Association notes.   On Jan. 22, Connecticut's Supreme Court decided a case forSFA Folio; it cited, as other courts had, the U.S. SupremeCourt's 1967 constitutional ruling that National Bellas Hessdidn't have enough links to Illinois to have to collect itstax. But the Tennessee judges said that argument is outdated;they saw ties -- including the state's need to dispose ofcatalogs thrown in the trash -- that justified treating thetwo mailorder firms like in-state retailers.   Both firms plan to appeal to Tennessee's Supreme Court. &quot;Ihave no doubt&quot; the issue is headed back to the U.S. SupremeCourt, Huddleston says.                                                                                                          K-9 COPS aren't eating high off the dogs, the IRS decides.Its private ruling 9109041 says an unidentified policedepartment needn't withhold taxes on dog-food allowances paidto special officers who handle police dogs and keep them athome. But the officers must account for the costs.                                                                                                          REAL-ESTATE professionals could deduct &quot;passive&quot; rentallosses from management and other &quot;active&quot; income under aHouse bill with 232 sponsors. But Fed Chairman Greenspancautions against such reversals of 1986 law meant to slowexcessive expansion of commercial property.                                                                                                          A FERRY we'll call the Video Slowpoker that sails to aforeign port and back in a day needn't collect the $3overnight-passenger tax. But it must collect a $3 tax if itputs in electronic gaming devices, as planned, IRS privateruling 9109039 says.                                                                                                          THE GERMAN TAX TREATY may hang on a once-dyingissue-estate taxes.   &quot;We're dismayed&quot; by German delays in final steps toactivate a pact that both sides ratified months ago, saysPhilip Morrison, Treasury international tax counsel, in rarepublic remarks on such a matter. He says the U.S. learned aGerman legislator is complaining again about U.S. law denyingfull marital estate-tax exemptions to alien spouses of U.S.citizens. That issue -- and the question of whether thetreaty applies to the former East Germany -- were to beresolved in supplemental talks not expected to delay thetreaty's entry into force.   But now it seems Germany may be delaying treaty activationto apply leverage on the estate-tax issue. So the Treasuryhas sent off a formal complaint that German inheritance-taxand marital-property laws discriminate against U.S. citizens.The U.S. has made proposals to settle all the issues and isawaiting responses, Morrison says.   A German diplomat in Washington indicates he doesn't knowof any intention to wield the treaty as a lever.
