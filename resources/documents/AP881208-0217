At least two callers claimed to be the person who has killed atleast 40 young women in the Northwest since 1982, but police wereunsure whether either call was authentic.   More than 16,000 calls were logged Wednesday, and phonescontinued ringing Thursday in response to the show about the GreenRiver and other serial-murder cases, while investigators beganplacing the crime tips in order of priority.   What were considered to be 1,500 good tips had been logged bynoon Thursday, said King County's Green River Task Force spokesmanDan Nolan. He said he didn't know exactly how many calls had come inby then.   By midnight Wednesday, 1,100 interesting tips had been culledfrom a total of 16,540 calls, Nolan said. He didn't know how manypertained specifically to Green River.   ``If we don't solve a couple of murders out of this I'll just beastounded,'' said Bob Evans, commander of the county's Green RiverTask Force.   An estimated 50 million people in the United States and Canadawatched Wednesday night's two-hour show, which producers called themost ambitious ``manhunt'' TV project ever undertaken. It wassyndicated to TV stations in 150 metropolitan markets by LexingtonBroadcasting of New York.   Police have made no arrests since finding the first victims inthe Green River south of Seattle. The murderer is blamed for killing40 women, most linked to prostitution and street life. Another eightmissing women are listed as potential victims.   Montgomery denied that the movie was a last-ditch effort to solvethe murder case before further staff cuts are forced in the countytask force, already pared to 13 from a one-time high of 40 people.   But he said authorities hope the movie approach, one which ``hasprobably never been tried before,'' will give investigators thecrucial clue. A reward of $100,000 has been offered for informationleading to the killer's arrest.   ``The response has been absolutely incredible,'' said Lou Gorfainof New Screen Concepts of New York, executive producer of ``Manhunt:A Chance to End the Nightmare.''   ``There weren't, surprisingly, that many crank calls.''   Seventy law enforcement officers from across the country, trainedto evaluate the information's usefulness, staffed 50 telephone linesduring the show. Some will remain as long as calls come inregularly, Montgomery said.   Included was an investigator from San Diego, where 38 women havebeen killed since 1985 in a case sharing several similarities withthe Green River case. No definite link, however, has beenestablished between the two.   Two men claimed to be the Green River killer in calls to thetelevision studio in Seattle and to a TV station in San Diego, Evanssaid.   The California call was ``taunting ... saying, `Yes, I did it andyou'll never catch me,''' Evans said, adding that it probably was acrank.   The Seattle caller was an ``adult male, very calm voice, claimingto be the killer and agreeing to mail us some photographs and mapsto lead us to other bodies,'' Evans said.   Calls couldn't be traced because of the nationwide, toll-freenumber that was used, and because Crime Stoppers guaranteesanonymity to its tipsters, Evans said.   The TV special was sponsored by Crime Stoppers, an organizationfounded 12 years ago to help police through radio and televisionbroadcasts depicting unsolved crimes.   ``With all the leads that came in for the crimes, it proves theCrime Stoppers format works,'' said Dan Fine, publicity chairman forSeattle-King County Crime Stoppers. ``I think it touched a lot ofpeople's hearts. People were riveted to their TV sets.''   The program was especially difficult for families of victims towatch.   ``I felt exactly like I did the day they came to my house andtold me,'' said Suzanne Villamin, whose 25-year-old daughter'sremains were found in 1984. ``It feels like something inside justdied. Sometimes I wish I would die so I can be with my daughter.''   ``Every time I saw my daughter's picture on the wall (in thetelevision program), it became very hard,'' said Marilyn Harrison,whose missing daughter, Kase Ann Lee, is a suspected Green Rivervictim. ``But I felt it was necessary for me to watch.   ``If there's a chance to find the monster, maybe this is the onlything that will do it.''</TEXT></DOC>
