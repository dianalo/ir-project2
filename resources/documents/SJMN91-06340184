Tokyo ultimately would contribute about $1.25 billion worth ofequipment built in Japan -- with no cash involved -- if it accepts a requestfrom President Bush when he visits Jan. 7-10, Watkins said. Earlier, theUnited States had been reported to be seeking several billion dollars,including cash donations. Bush plans to ask Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa tocommit Japan only to general support of the project &quot;for the longer haul,&quot;with no budgeting before fiscal 1993, Watkins said.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  General News  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  U.S. TO SEEK LESS SUPERCOLLIDER AID  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Foreign News in Brief  </MEMO><BYLINE>  Mercury News Wire Services  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911205  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  December  </MONTH><PG.COL>  8C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  119  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday, December 5, 199100340184,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
