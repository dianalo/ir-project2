The assault Thursday near a road construction site on theoutskirts of Huancavelica, a state capital 155 miles southeast ofLima, was the most devastating in a wave of attacks by Shining Pathguerrillas this month.   ``A group of army personnel were the object of a cowardly attackby delinquent subversives,'' the Joint Military Command said. Lopezand the joint command declined to elaborate on how the rebelsmounted the raid.   Lopez said the troops were traveling in civilian vehicles fromHuancavelica to the road construction site to provide protection togovernment workers.   The Mao-inspired Shining Path has been fighting for eight yearsto topple the government and install a Marxist state.   A year ago, the guerrillas exploded a mine near Huancavelicathat killed 10 soldiers and four civilians. One week ago, in anearly identical attack, rebels killed 10 soldiers and wounded 14.   Since early February, leftist guerrillas have killed fivetelephone company workers, bombed and derailed two ore trains andbombed the office of Royal Dutch Shell and five other privateoffices in Lima.   Huancavelica, one of Peru's most impoverished and isolatedregions, is under a state of emergency to counter rising guerrillaviolence.   The government says more than 10,000 people, including troops,police, guerrillas and non-combatants, have died during the ShiningPath insurgency.</TEXT></DOC>
