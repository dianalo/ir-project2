The pressuregenerator comprises in combination: (a) a base; (b) a flexible membranesecured to the base for defining in combination with the base an envelopehaving a volume commensurate with the state of flex of the membrane;(c) an aperture disposed in the base, the aperture being the only sourceof fluid communication with the interior of the envelope, the apertureaccommodating both outflow and inflow of fluid between the envelope andthe conduit, (d) a valve for sealing the aperture; (e) means for openingthe valve to accommodate the outflow and inflow of fluid only in responseto flexing of membrane and a commensurate change in volume of the envelope;and (f) means for interconnecting the aperture with the conduit to directflow of fluid between the envelope and the conduit. On flexing of themembrane, fluid is expelled from within the envelope through the valveinto the conduit and fluid flow from the conduit through the apertureinto the envelope is inhibited unless the membrane is flexed.</TEXT></DOC>
