Thomas E. Muldoon and Leonard L. Ingram, a former executive of acompany that hired Muldoon as a defense consultant, are accused ofconspiring to pay bribes to Jack A. Sherman, a one-time MarineCorps. procurement officer.   The trial scheduled to begin Monday in U.S. District Court inAlexandria, Va., would be only the second in the lengthyinvestigation, known as Operation Ill Wind, into possiblemultibillion-dollar procurement fraud.   The investigation so far has yielded more than 25 convictions ofindividuals and four corporations.   The indictment against Muldoon and Ingram charges they were partof a seven-year scheme to funnel payments of more than $80,000 toSherman for his help getting Pentagon business.   In return, Sherman steered contracts worth more than $6.2million to Lee Telecommunications, which became a subsidiary ofWhittaker Corp. in 1986, according to court documents.   The contracts were to provide computers and electronic equipmentfor an battlefield air-traffic control system known as ATACC.   Whittaker Command and Control Systems, the Whittaker subsidiarythat absorbed Lee Telecommunications, along with two of its formerexecutives and another defense consultant, pleaded guilty inSeptember to charges of participating in the bribery scheme.   Whittaker agreed to pay $3.5 million in fines and penalties.   Scott M. Lamberth, a former vice president of the Whittakersubsidiary, and John Franklin Van Tassel, who headed itsFayetteville, Ark., facility agreed to cooperate with thegovernment's investigation as part of their guilty plea.   San Diego defense consultant Donald Illeman also pleaded guiltyand agreed to cooperate.   If convicted, Muldoon faces a maximum possible prison sentenceof 70 years and fines up to $1.04 million. The charges againstIngram, a Lee stockholder and former vice president of the companyand the Whittaker subsidiary, carry a possible sentence of 95 yearsand fines of up to $1.53 million.   In the only other trial of the investigation, two executives ofTeledyne Electronics were convicted last spring of conspiracy andwire fraud but were acquitted of charges they participated in abribery scheme to influence the award of Pentagon contracts. Athird Teledyne executive was acquitted altogether.   On Friday, Justice Department prosecutors signaled they werezeroing in on three other major figures in the Ill Windinvestigation with the guilty plea by Loral Corp.   The New York-based defense company admitted it conspired toobtain inside information about a contract to make radar detectionequipment for F-16 fighters and another to build a Navy blimp.   The company, which agreed to pay $5.77 million in fines andpenalties, admitted that it paid defense consultant William M.Galvin $578,000 to obtain confidential bid information about AirForce and Navy contracts from two senior Pentagon officials.   Galvin obtained information about a radar-detection equipmentcontract from Victor D. Cohen, then a deputy assistant Air Forcesecretary, according to charges that Loral admitted.   Cohen was to personally benefit from passing information toGalvin about the $43.4 million contract Loral was awarded, courtpapers said.   A statement of facts filed by prosecutors indicated that Cohenshared some of the consulting fees Loral paid Galvin.   On the Navy contract, Galvin also enlisted the aid of MelvynPaisley, an assistant Navy secretary for engineering, research, andsystems before going into business with Galvin in the spring of1987.   Galvin provided assistance for Loral's unsuccessful efforts towin the blimp contract, according to court papers.   Neither Galvin, Cohen nor Paisley has been charged.
