<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-18-0498 </DOCNO><TEXT>A conceptual design for a new type of ion mass spectrograph is presentedthat is particularly suited for measuring energetic (1 eV to 50 keV/charge)anisotropic space plasmas. The ion optics consist of two toroidal electrostaticanalyzers followed by a combined toroidal electric-magnetic sector field.The resultant Mattauch-Herzog type configuration exhibits double-focusingproperties for all masses along an oblique line exterior to the magneticfield. Although the focusing properties vary with ion energy, particularfield geometries exist which minimize this energy dependence. As a result,good mass resolution and high sensitivity can be maintained over a wideenergy range. Mass resolution is adequate to resolve mass/charge values(1, 2, 4, 8, 16) at all energies and can be increased to andgt; 20 in specializedlow-energy (andless; 5 keV) modes. The spectrographic mass imaging range isandgt; 16 amu at energies above 10 keV. The toroidal geometry focuses in elevationdirection, thus minimizing overall instrument and detector sizes whileproviding limited angular resolution in that direction. Large beam acceptancesresult in very high overall instrument sensitivity (geometric factor{approx_equal} 10/sup -2/ cm/sup 2/ sr keV).</TEXT></DOC>
