COLEMAN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Natural chemical processes in the body _ notcontamination _ may be behind hundreds of cases of a rare, painfulblood disorder in people who took the health-food supplementL-tryptophan, researchers say.   The substance, sold as a natural relaxation aid, has beenrecalled voluntarily by several makers at the urging of the U.S.Food and Drug Administration, which suspected contamination.   Fourteen people who took L-tryptophan have died in recent monthsand more than 1,200 others have fallen ill witheosinophilia-myalgia, a rare blood disroder which in milder casescauses aches, rashes and fever.   The new study was conducted at Georgetown University inWashington, D.C., and reported in Friday's Journal of the AmericanMedical Association.   ``Arguing against the contamination theory is that in spite ofthe fact that people have been searching (for the contaminant), ithasn't been identified,'' said one of the researchers, Dr. PaulKatz, chief rheumatologist at Georgetown.   ``Also, the L-tryptophan implicated has been traced to threedifferent manufacturers,'' Katz said in a telephone interviewThursday. ``That argues a little bit against there being acommon-source contaminant.''   Chris Lecos, an FDA spokesman, said the research didn't changethe agency's advice against taking L-tryptophan.   ``It doesn't serve the public to come forth with speculation.What we're looking for is a clear-cut explanation,'' Lacos said.   But he acknowledged in a telephone interview from Washington onThursday, ``We've analyzed hundreds of samples (of L-tryptophan),including from victims themselves, and have failed to identify aspecific chemical or microbial contaminant responsible for theoutbreak.''   Lecos added, ``This is not a disease that should be takenlightly by anyone. People should stop taking this stuff.''   Katz and his colleagues at Georgetown believe L-tryptophansupplements under certain conditions may contribute to a build-upof a naturally occurring substance in the body called serotonin.   Serotonin is a byproduct of the breakdown of L-tryptophan, whichis an amino acid, or protein component, that occurs naturally inmany foods but is usually present in greater concentrations in thedietary supplement.   Some researchers believe abnormal levels of serotonin maycontribute to syndromes similar to eosinophilia-myalgia, Katz said.   L-tryptophan supplements have been sold over the counter foryears to combat sleeplessness, depression, premenstrual syndrome,stress and other problems.   Eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome _ which is caused by an excess ofa certain type of white blood cell _ have been noted in peopletaking L-tryptophan supplements only in the last year or so.   The disorder may have occurred earlier and been diagnosed asdifferent but similar syndromes, Katz said.   The researchers found seven patients at Georgetown who developedthe rare blood disorder while taking L-tryptophan.   All patients had the muscle pain and tenderness characteristicof the syndrome, and rashes, fever and breathing difficulty werecommon, the researchers said.   Three of the patients had taken antidepressant medication, whichinhibits the absorption of serotonin by nerve cells in the brain.Their use in conjunction with L-tryptophan probably resulted in anexcess that the body was unable to chemically process, the authorssuggest.   In the other four cases, the patients' bodies for some reasonmay have been unable to metabolize L-tryptophan, Katz said.   By mid-February, the national Centers for Disease Control hadrecorded 14 deaths and 1,269 cases of illness nationwide fromeosinophilia-myalgia syndrome associated with ingestion ofL-tryptophan supplements.   The Food and Drug Administration on Nov. 17 requested avoluntary recall of L-tryptophan supplements and five days laterextended that to include a ban on imports.   Dr. Richard M. Silver, associate professor of medicine andpediatrics at the Medical University of South Carolina, who hasstudied L-tryptophan, said the Georgetown researchers ``may be ontarget.''</TEXT></DOC>
