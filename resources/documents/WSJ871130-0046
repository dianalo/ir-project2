The winner of the four-way presidential race isn't likely to capture more than 35% of the vote, leaving him politically vulnerable. The vanquished may seek revenge, by either scheming behind the scenes or vying for support in April's National Assembly elections.    &quot;No matter who is elected, you are going to have a government with a legitimacy problem from the start,&quot; says Daryl Plunk, an expert on South Korea at Richard V. Allen Co. &quot;The problem with the system is whoever is elected will take office with the majority of the voters on the record against him.&quot;    Barring surprises, such as the assassination of a candidate or military intervention before the vote, South Korea is ready to pull off its first democratic presidential election in 16 years. The bigger question is whether the nation can make it through its first democratic transition of power ever. The final answer might not be known for many months, after the April National Assembly elections and the September Summer Olympics, which will have most politicians on their best behavior.    &quot;There will be turmoil, but my own view is the Olympics will act as a brake on the level of turmoil,&quot; says Selig Harrison of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. &quot;After the Olympics is when the stops are off, when things will really get hot.&quot;    If Roh Tae Woo, the government candidate, wins, he would immediately face charges of an unfair election and the threat of violent student demonstrations. His best strategy would be to hold out olive branches to the opposition. To defuse street protests, he could offer opposition candidates cabinet positions, push through strong legislation ensuring civil and press freedoms, release remaining political prisoners and offer a monument and reparations to relatives of the victims of the 1980 Kwangju massacre, in which government troops gunned down anti-government protestors.    But if the vote is considered fraudulent, such measures wouldn't help. &quot;It's important in the final days before the elections that the government keep its activities to the minimum standard of fairness that Koreans hold to,&quot; says William H. Gleysteen, a former U.S. ambassador to South Korea. &quot;If the government wins, it will immediately have to defend itself against the charge that it stole the election.&quot;    The government of President Chun Doo Hwan is working hard to support its candidate. It has increased farmers' wages, introduced national health insurance, offered scholarships to local officials for their children and made sure government-run television gives Mr. Roh top billing on the nightly news. It also goes far to keep tales of government corruption out of state-controlled newspapers.    Military commanders likely will see to it that most of their 600,000 troops vote for Mr. Roh, a former general. However, even the opposition doesn't expect outright vote-rigging. The critical question is whether government actions will become so egregious that they arouse public opinion against Mr. Roh.    A victory by Kim Dae Jung, the most liberal opposition candidate, would create the greatest immediate tension. Some Western diplomats in Seoul don't believe the military and the security apparatus would let him take office, fearing that he would ultimately seek revenge against them after his years of being politically repressed. Some of Mr. Kim's advisers fear that he could be assassinated. Others foresee a different scenario: The powerful military and security forces would be so uncooperative that his rule would fail and the public would welcome their intervention to get rid of him.    &quot;Kim Dae Jung must move quickly to reassure the military, the Korean Central Intelligence Agency and businessmen that he will ensure policy continuity and not attack their interests,&quot; says an administration official. &quot;If he doesn't, he won't survive.&quot;    A victory by Kim Young Sam, the more moderate opposition candidate, would trigger the least hostility, but he still would have to wrestle with a government never run by an elected opposition and the difficult task, after such a bitter campaign, of forming National Assembly coalitions to push his policies through.    The fourth candidate, former Prime Minister Kim Jong Pil, hasn't much chance of winning. His best hope, an administration official says, is an opposition victory, which could, after some parliamentary maneuvering, position him to pick up the pieces should the opposition fail at running the country.    With the election approaching, the only certainty is uncertainty. &quot;The forces for change and the forces for conservatism are in rough balance in Korea,&quot; says Mr. Gleysteen, the former ambassador. &quot;Very small groups and occurences can have a great deal of influence. Abrupt and surprising events take place in Korea more than anywhere else I know.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
