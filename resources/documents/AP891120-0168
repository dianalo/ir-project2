Spawned by the Northern Hemisphere's most productive glacier 25miles to the south, these mountains of ice break off with athunderous roar and begin their silent arctic voyage.   The barking of sled dogs, which outnumber the 4,000 people ofthe town, mixes with the chugging of cutters and shrimp boats andthe hum of the fish factories in the tiny harbor.   Against the darkened sky, the Northern Lights unfurl in wavysheets of red and green across the horizon.   Ilulissat, which means icebergs in the native language, isinhabited by Inuits who are culturally and linguistically relatedto the Eskimos of Alaska and others in Canada and Siberia.   Nearly everyone in the town, 180 miles north of the ArcticCircle, make their living from the sea.   Its economy is totally dependent on shrimp and halibut catches,which the local fishermen deliver directly to the two big state-runfish factories, employing 350 people in the peak season.   Ilulissat, Greenland's third-largest town, also is known by itsDanish name, Jacobshavn. Denmark, which ruled Greenland for 200years, made it an autonomous territory under the Danish crown 10years ago.   About 50 fishing boats, ranging from factory trawlers to one-mancutters, operate during the summer from Ilulissat's natural harbor.   In the winters of 24-hour darkness, many fishermen such asSoeren Madsen go ``longlining'' on the Icefjord, a frozen fiord atthe foot of the glacier.   ``We drive 35 miles overland across rough terrain in dogsleds tothe fishing grounds, and the temperature can fall to minus 22degrees Fahrenheit out on the ice,'' Madsen says.   Long lines strung with up to 100 hooks are sunk through holescut in the ice and then hauled up by hand from the depths.   ``You have to return with a catch of at least 400 pounds to makeit pay,'' Madsen says.   A typical fishing tour on the ice lasts 48 hours, during whichtime the men live in low, conical tents with a Primus stove to keepwarm.   The dog teams of 10 to 12 huskies sleep huddled together out inthe open. They are capable of running 12 hours non-stop.   Some of the fishermen make a little extra money on the sidedriving sleds for winter tourists who come to see the naturalwonders of the Disko Bay area.   In Ilulissat, it's an unwritten law that dog sleds have theright of way.   Ilulissat municipality includes four small outlying settlementsof 80 to 100 inhabitants each. Beyond those tiny villages lienothing but the glacial ice pack, 2{ miles thick, of Greenland'sinterior.   No roads link the town with its satellite settlements. Travel isby boat, sled or helicopter.   The Greenlandic dog, a special breed protected by a ban onimports of other races, is not tame, and visitors are advised notto pet them.   Practically every dwelling in the town has a dog team in theyard where fish for their fodder is hung up in racks to dry.   The dogs must be kept chained, their fangs cut. Stray dogs areshot on orders from the authorities.   Many hunters are embittered over an anti-sealing campaign wagedby conservationists that ruined the once-lucrative skin trade.   In the early 1980s, environmental groups such as Greenpeace,spurred on by French actress and self-styled animal friend BrigitteBardot, launched highly publicized protests against the Canadianpractice of bludgeoning seal pups to death for their prized whitepelts.   Gruesome pictures of the Canadian seal hunt became associated inthe public mind with the Greenlanders' traditional hunt, which doesnot include pups.   Seal pups are born on the ice floes off northern Canada and arerarely seen in Greenlandic waters.   Prices for Greenlandic skins plunged in Europe, and the UnitedStates, a major market, banned the import of seal skins.   ``Greenpeace eventually apologized to Greenland, but they shouldhave admitted their mistake to the consumers as well,'' said AdolfJensen, a hunter who comes from a tiny settlement 62 miles north ofIlulissat.</TEXT><NOTE>END ADV</NOTE></DOC>
