The sorbent was the same as used by them earlier for molybdenumpreconcentration. It is a fiber based on polyethylenepolyamine-modifiedpolyacrylonitrile. The sorbent contained 80% tertiary and {approx}20%primary and secondary amino groups. Static exchange capacity of the sorbentrelative to HCl 2 mmole/g, swelling 34%, fiber diameter 0.016 mm. Thevanadium content was determined photometrically using acidic chromiumblue K.</TEXT></DOC>
