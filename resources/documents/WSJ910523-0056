Advancing over-the-counterissues outpaced decliners 971 to 832.   But trading activity remained relatively light. NationalMarket System volume eased to 105,734,600 shares from112,700,500 shares Tuesday. During the market's strong rallyduring the first quarter, daily volume averaged about 128million shares.   While the Nasdaq market posted solid gains throughout thesession, Big Board issues spent much of the day lower. TheDow Jones Industrial Average recovered late in the day tofinish with a gain of 4.25, or 0.15%. The New York StockExchange Composite Index closed with a gain of 0.34, or0.17%.   Charles Howley, manager of OTC trading at SoundviewFinancial Corp., said Nasdaq stocks performed better than BigBoard issues in part because of the strong influence exertedon the over-the-counter market by technology-related shares.   A soaring technology sector led the over-the-countermarket to a 30% advance during the first quarter, but a sharpselloff in technology stocks over the past month has left themarket drifting.   Now, Mr. Howley says, the market may be poised to gainfrom a technology-based rebound. &quot;Technology stocks arebouncing back rather smartly now. It seems like they canfollow through,&quot; he said. He says that the earlier sell-offin technology stocks may have made people &quot;re-examine thegroup, and I think they are beginning to see values at theseprices.&quot;   But Mr. Howley said the lack of a rebound in tradingvolume is keeping him cautious about the prospects forfurther market gains.   Nelson Gold, senior vice president of OTC trading atInterstate/Johnson Lane Corp., said that while he isn't yetbullish on the Nasdaq market's prospects, &quot;I'm not going tofight the tape.&quot;   Mr. Gold said he is surprised by the market's strengthover the past two days despite the uncertainties about thestrength of the U.S. economy and the direction of interestrates.
