</T3>This Supplement establishes the DoD Spare Parts BreakoutProgram and provides uniform policies and procedures for management andconduct of the program within and between the Military Departments andthe Defense Agencies.S6-101 <T3>Applicability.</T3>(a) Except as provided in (b) below, this Supplement applies to:(1) any centrally managed replenishment or provisioned part (hereinafterreferred to as ``part'') for military systems and equipment, and(2) all DoD personnel involved with design control, acquisition and managementof such parts including, but not limited to, project/program/system managers,technical personnel, contracting officers, legal counsel, inventory managers,inspectors, and small business utilization specialists and technical advisors.(b) This Supplement does not apply to:(1) component breakout (see DFARS 17.7202)(2) foreign military sales (FMS) peculiar items(3) insurance items (e.g. one-time buy)(4) obsolete items(5) phase out items (e.g. life of type buy)(6) items with annual buy values below the thresholds developed by DoDComponents or field activities(7) parts being acquired under other specifically defined initial supportprograms, or(8) parts acquired through local purchase.S6-102 <T3>General.</T3>(a) Significant resources are dedicated to the acquisition and managementof parts for military systems and equipment. Adequate consideration shallbe given to decisions made early in a weapon system acquisition relatedto the ability to competitively buy spares. Initially, repairable or consumableparts are identified and acquired through a provisioning process; repairableor consumable parts acquired thereafter are for replenishment. The objectiveof the DoD Spare Parts Breakout Program is to reduce costs through theuse of competitive procurement methods, or the purchase of parts directlyfrom the actual manufacturer rather than the prime contractor, while maintainingthe integrity of the systems and equipment in which the parts are to beused. The program is based on the application of sound management and engineeringjudgment in (i) determining the feasibility of acquiring parts by competitiveprocedures or direct purchase from actual manufacturers and (ii) overcomingor removing constraints to breakout identified through the screening process(technical review described in S6-302.(b) This Supplement sets forth procedures to screen and code parts in orderto provide contracting officers (i) summary information regarding technicaldata and (ii) sources of supply to meet the Government's minimum requirements.This information assists the contracting officer to select the method ofcontracting, identify sources of supply, and make other decisions in thepreaward and award phases, with consideration for established parametersof system and equipment integrity, readiness, and the opportunities tocompetitively acquire parts (see FAR/DFARS Part 6). The identificationof sources for parts, for example, requires knowledge of manufacturingsources, additional operation performed after manufacturer of parts possessingsafety or other critical characteristics, and the availability of technicaldata.(c) The result of the screening process (technical review) is indicatedby an Acquisition Method Code (AMC) and an Acquisition Method Suffix Code(AMSC). This program provides procedures for both the initial assignmentof an AMC and an AMSC to a part, and for the recurring review of thesecodes (see S6-202 and S6-203(b)(1)).S6-103 <T3>Definitions. </T3>For purposes of this Supplement, the following definitionsapply.S6-103.1 <T3>Acquisition Method Code (AMC). </T3>A single digit numeric code, assignedby a DoD activity, to describe to the contracting officer and other Governmentpersonnel the results of a technical review of a part and its suitabilityfor breakout.S6-103.2 <T3>Acquisition Method Code Conference. </T3>A conference which is generallyheld at the contractor's facility for the purpose of reviewing contractortechnical information codes (CTICs) and corresponding substantiating datefor breakout.S6-103.3 <T3>Acquisition Method Suffix Code (AMSC). </T3>A single digit alpha code,assigned by a DoD activity, which provides the contracting officer andother Government personnel with engineering, manufacturing and technicalinformation.S6-103.4 <T3>Actual Manufacturer. </T3>An individual, activity, or organizationthat performs the physical fabrication processess that produce the deliverablepart or other items of supply for the Government.

For a more detailed definition, see DFARS 27.401.  S6-104 <T3>General Policies</T3>. (a) The identification, selection, and screening of parts for breakoutshall be made as early as possible to determine the technical and economicconsiderations of the opportunties for breakout to competition or directpurchase. Full and open competition is the preferred result of breakoutscreening.  (b) A part shall be made a candidate for breakout screening based on itscost effectiveness for breakout. Resources should be assigned and prioritygiven to those parts with the greatest expected return given their annualbuy value, life cycle buy value, and likelihood of successful breakout,given technical characteristics such as design and performance stability.Consideration of all such factors is necessary to ensure the maximum returnon investment in a given breakout program. Occasionally an item will notmeet strict economic considerations for breakout, but action may be requireddue to other considerations to avoid overpricing situations. Accordingly,no minimum DoD threshold is hereby set for breakout screening actions.DoD Components and field activities will develop annual buy thresholdsfor breakout screening which are consistent with economic considerationsand resources. Every effort should be made to complete the full screeningof parts that are expected to be subsequently replenished as they enterthe inventory.  (c) Breakout improvement efforts shall continue through the life cycleof a part to improve its breakout status (see S6-203) or until such timeas the part is coded 1G, 2G, 1K, 2K, 1M, 2M, 1N, 2N, 1T, 2T, 1Z or 2Z. (d) No firm shall be denied the opportunity to demonstrate its abilityto furnish a part which meets the Government's needs, without regard toa part's annual buy value, where a restrictive AMC/AMSC is assigned (seeFAR 9.202). A firm must clearly demonstrate, normally at its own expense,that it can satisfy the Government's requirements. The Government shallmake a vigorous effort to expedite its evaluation of such demonstrationand to furnish a decision to the demonstrating firm within a reasonableperiod of time. If a resolution cannot be made within 60 days, the offerormust be advised of the status of the request and be provided with a goodfaith estimate of the date the evaluation will be completed. Every reasonableeffort shall be made to complete the review before a subsequent procurementis made. Also, restrictive codes and low annual buy value do not precludeconsideration of a surplus dealer or other nonmanufacturing source whenthe part offered was manufactured by an approved source (see FAR 10.010).A potential surplus dealer or other nonmanufacturing source must providethe Government with all the necessary evidence which proves the proposedpart meets the Government's requirements.  (e) The experience and knowledge accrued by contractors in the development,design, manufacture and test of equipment may enhance the breakout decision-makingprocess. DoD activities may obtain technical information from contractorswhen it is considered requisite to an informed coding decision. The procedurefor contracting for this information is provided at Part 4. Contractor'stechnical information will be designated by CTICs. Only DoD activitiesshall assign AMCs and AMSCs.  (f) DoD activities with breakout screening responsibilities shall develop,document, and advertise programs which promote the development of qualifiedsources for parts that are currently being purchased sole source. Theseprograms should provide fair and reasonable technical assistance (engineeringor other technical data, parts on bailment, etc.) to contractors who provethey have potential for becoming a qualified second source for an item.These programs should also provide specially tailored incentives to successfulfirms so as to stimulate their investment in becoming qualified. For example,Government furnished equipment (GFE) or Government furnished material (GFM)for reverse engineering and technical data package review and assistance.(g) DoD Components shall identify the engineering support activity, designcontrol activity, actual manufacturer, and prime contractor for each partsuch that the information is readily available to breakout and acquisitionpersonnel.  S6-105 <T3>Responsibilities.  </T3>(a) The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Production and Logistics, shallexercise authority for direction and management of the DoD Spare PartsBreakout Program, including the establishment and maintenance of implementingregulations.  (b) The Military Departments and Defense Agencies shall perform auditsto ensure that their respective activities comply with the provisions ofthis program.  (c) Commanders of DoD activities with breakout screening responsibilityshall:  (1) Implement a breakout program consistent with the requirements of thisSupplement.  (2) Assist in the identification and acquisition of necessary data rightsand technical data during system/equipment development and production toallow, when feasible, breakout of parts.  (3) Designate a program manager to serve as the central focal point, communicatebreakout policy, ensure cost effectiveness of screening actions and breakoutprogram, provide assistance in implementing breakout screening, monitorongoing breakout efforts and achievements, and provide surveillance overimplementation of this Supplement. The program manager shall report onlyto the Commander, or his deputy, of the activity with breakout screeningresponsibility.  (4) Ensure that actions to remove impediments to breakout are continuedso long as it is cost effective, or until no further breakout improvementscan be made.  (5) Invite the activity's Small and Small Disadvantaged Business Utilization(SADBU) Specialist and the resident Small Business Administration's ProcurementCenter Representative (PCR), if any, to participate in all acquisitionmethod coding conferences at Government and contractor locations.  (6) Assure timely engineering and technical support to other breakout activitiesregardless of location.  i. In the case of parts where contracting or inventory management responsibilityhas been transferred, such support shall include:  (A) assignment of an AMC/AMSC prior to the transfer. (B) assignment of an AMC/AMSC when requested by the receiving activityto parts transferred without such codes. The requesting activity may recommendan AMC/AMSC.  (C) full support of the receiving activities' breakout effort by providingtimely engineering support in revising existing AMC/AMSCs.  ii. In all cases, such support shall include, but not be limited to, furnishingall necessary technical data and other information (such as code suspensedate and procurement history) to permit acquisition in accordance withthe assigned AMC/AMSC (see S6-105(d)(6)).  (7) Assure that appropriate surveillance is given to first time breakoutparts.  (d) Breakout program managers shall be responsible for:  (1) Initiating the breakout process during the early phases of developmentand continue the process during the life of the part.  (2) Considering the need for Contractor Technical Information Codes (CTICs)and, when needed, initiating a contract data requirement.   (3) Identifying, selecting and screening in accordance with Part 3.  (4) Assigning an AMC/AMSC, using all available data, including CTICs. (5) Responding promptly to a request for evaluation of additional sourcesor a review of assigned codes. An evaluation not completed prior to animmediate buy shall be promptly completed for future buys.  (6) Documenting all assignments and changes, to include rationale for assigningthe chosen code, in a permanent file for each part. As a minimum the fileshould identify the engineering support activity, cognizant design controlactivity, actual manufacturer, prime contractor, known sources of supply,and any other information needed to support AMC/AMSC assignments.  (e) Contracting officers responsible for the acquisition of replenishmentparts shall:  (1) Consider the AMC/AMSC when developing the method of contracting, thelist of sources to be solicited, the type of contract, etc.  (2) Provide information which is inconsistent with the assigned AMC/AMSC(e.g., availability of technical data or possible sources) to the activityresponsible for code assignment with a request for timely evaluation ofthe additional information. An urgent immediate buy need not be delayedif an evaluation of the additional information cannot be completed in timeto meet the required delivery date.<ITAG tagnum="84">Part 2_Breakout Coding </ITAG>andSection; 6-200 <T3>Scope. </T3>This part provides parts breakout codes and prescribesresponsibilities for their assignment and management. andSection; 6-201 <T3>Coding. </T3>Three types of codes are used in the breakout program.andSection; 6-201.1 <T3>Acquisition Method Codes. </T3>The following codes shall be assignedby DoD activities to describe the results of the spare parts breakout screening:(a) AMC 0. The part was not assigned AMC 1 through 5 when it entered theinventory, nor has it ever completed screening. Use of this code is sometimesnecessary but discouraged. Maximum effort to determine the applicabilityof an alternate AMC is the objective. This code will never be used to recodea part that already has AMC 1 through 5 assigned, and shall never be assignedas a result of breakout screening. Maximum effort to determine the applicabilityof AMC 1 through 5 is the objective. (b) AMC 1. Suitable for competitive acquisition for the second or subsequenttime. (c) AMC 2. Suitable for competitive acquisition for the first time. (d) AMC 3. Acquire, for the second or subsequent time, directly from theactual manufacturer. (e) AMC 4. Acquire, for the first time, directly from the actual manufacturer.(f) AMC 5. Acquire, directly from a sole source contractor which is notthe actual manufacturer. andSection; 6-201.2 <T3>Acquisition Method Suffix Codes. </T3>The following codes shall beassigned by DoD activities to further describe the Acquisition Method Code.Valid combinations of AMCs/AMSCs are indicated in each subparagraph belowand summarized in Exhibit I. (a) AMSC A. The Government's rights to use data in its possession is questionable.This code is only applicable to parts under immediate buy requirementsand for as long thereafter as rights to data are still under review forresolution and appropriate coding. <T3>This code is assigned only at the conclusion of limited screening,</T3>and it remains assigned until the full screening process resolvesthe Government's rights to use data and results in assignment of a differentAMSC. If one source is available, AMCs 3, 4 or 5 are valid. If at leasttwo sources exist, or if the data is adequate for an alternate source toqualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures, AMCs1 or 2 are valid.(b) AMSC B. This part must be acquired from a manufacturing source(s) specifiedon a source control or selected item drawing as defined by the currentversion of DoD-STD-100. Suitable technical data, unlimited Government datarights, or manufacturing knowledge are not available to permit acquisitionfrom other sources, nor qualification testing of another part, nor useof a second source part in the intended application. Although, by DoD-STD-100definition, altered and selected items shall have an adequate technicaldata package, data review discloses that required data or data rights arenot in Government possession and cannot be economically obtained. If onesource is available, AMCs 3, 4 or 5 are valid. If a least two sources exist,AMCs 1 or 2 are valid. (c) AMSC C. This part requires engineering source approval by the designcontrol activity in order to maintain the quality of the part. Existingunique design capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledgeby the qualified source(s) require acquisition of the part from the approvedsource(s). The approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge,or technical data that are not economically available to the Government,and the data or knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of thepart. An alternate source must qualify in accordance with the design controlactivity's procedures, as approved by the cognizant Government engineeringactivity. The qualification procedures must be approved by the Governmentengineering activity having jurisdiction over the part in the intendedapplication. If one source is approved, AMCs 3, 4 or 5 are valid. If atleast two sources are approved or if data is adequate for an alternatesource to qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures,AMCs 1 or 2 are valid. (d) AMSC D. The data needed to procure this part competitively <T3>is not physically available, </T3>it cannot be obtained economically,nor is it possible to draft adequate specifications or any other adequate,economical description of the material for a competitive solicitation.AMCs 3, 4 or 5 are valid. (e) AMSC E. (Reserved)(f) AMSC F. (Reserved)(g) AMSC G. The Government has unlimited rights to the technical data,the data package is complete, and there are no technical data, engineering,tooling or manufacturing restrictions. (This is the only AMSC that impliesthat parts are candidate for full and open competition. Other AMSCs suchas K, M, N, Q, and S may imply limited competition when two or more independentsources exist yet the technical data package is inadequate for full andopen competition.) AMCs 1 or 2 are valid. (h) AMSC H. The Government physically does not have in its possession sufficient,accurate or legible data to purchase this part from other than the currentsource(s). This code is applicable only to parts under immediate buy requirementsand only for as long thereafter as the deficiency is under review for resolutionand appropriate recoding. <T3>This code is only assigned at the conclusion of limited screening,</T3>and it remains assigned until the full screening process resolvesphysical data questions and results in assignment of a different AMSC.If one source is available, AMCs 3, 4 or 5 are valid. If at least two sourcesexist, AMCs 1 or 2 are valid.(i) AMSC I. (Not authorized)(j) AMSC J. (Reserved)(k) AMSC K. This part must be produced from class 1 castings and similartype forgings as approved (controlled) by procedures contained in the currentversion of MIL-STD-2175. If one source has such castings and cannot providethem to other sources, AMCs 3, 4 or 5 are valid. If at least two sourceshave such castings or they can be provided to other sources, AMCs 1 or2 are valid.(1) AMSC L. The annual buy value of this part falls below the screeningthreshold established by DoD Components and field activities. However,this part has been screened for additional known sources, resulting ineither confirmation that the initial source exists or that other sourcesmay supply the part. No additional screening was performed to identifythe competitive or noncompetitive conditions that would result in assignmentof a different AMSC. This code shall not be used when screening parts enteringthe inventory. This code shall be used only to replace AMSC O for partsunder the established screening threshold. If one source is available,AMCs 3, 4, or 5 are valid. If at least two sources exist, AMCs 1 or 2 arevalid.(m) AMSC M. Manufacture of this part requires use of master or coordinatedtooling. If only one set of tooling exists and cannot be made availableto another source for manufacture of this part, AMCs 3, 4, or 5 are valid.When the availability of existent or refurbishable tooling is availableto two or more sources, then AMCs 1 or 2 are valid.(n) AMSC N. Manufacture of this part requires special test and/or inspectionfacilities to determine and maintain ultra-precision quality for its functionor system integrity. Substantiation and inspection of the precision orquality cannot be accomplished without such specialized test or inspectionfacilities. If the test cannot be made available for the competitive manufactureof the part, the required test or inspection knowledge cannot be documentedfor reliable replication, or the required physical test or inspection facilitiesand processes cannot be economically documented in a TDP, valid AMCs, are3, 4 or 5. If the facilities or tests can be made available to two or morecompetitive sources, AMCs 1 or 2 are valid.(o) AMSC O. The part was not assigned an AMSC when it entered the inventory,nor has it ever completed screening. Use of this code in conjunction withAMC O is sometimes necessary but discouraged. Maximum effort to determinethe applicability of an alternate AMSC is the objective. Only AMC O isvalid.(p) AMSC P. The rights to use the data needed to purchase this part fromadditional source(s) is not owned by the Government and cannot be purchased,developed or otherwise obtained. It is uneconomical to reverse engineerthis part. This code is used in situations where the Government has thedata but does not own the rights to the data. If only one source has therights or data to manufacture this item, AMCs 3, 4 or 5 are valid. If twoor more sources have the rights or data to manufacture this time, AMCs1 or 2 are valid.(q) AMSC Q. The Government does not have adequate data, lacks rights todata, or both needed to purchase this part from additional sources. TheGovernment has been unable to economically buy the data or rights to thedata, although the part has been undergoing full screening for 12 or moremonths. Breakout to competition has not been achieved, but current, continuingactions to obtain necessary rights to data or adequate, reprocurement technicaldata indicate breakout to competition is expected to be achieved. Thispart may be a candidate for reverse engineering or other techniques toobtain technical data. No immediate buy of this part has occurred to initiatelimited screening and assignment of AMSCs A or H. This code may be usedto change from AMSC O or any other noncompetitive AMSC except A or H (whichare only assigned after limited screening). All AMSC Q items are requiredto be reviewed within the timeframes cited in S6-203(b). If one sourceis available, AMCs 3, 4 or 5 are valid. If at least two sources exist,AMCs 1 or 2 are valid.(r) AMSC R. The Government <T3>does not own</T3> the data or the rights to the data needed to purchasethis part from additional sources. It has been determined to be uneconomicalto buy the data or rights to the data. It is uneconomical to reverse engineerthe part. This code is used when the Government did not initially purchasethe data and/or rights. If only one source has the rights or data to manufacturethis item, AMCs 3, 4 or 5 are valid. If two or more sources have the rightsor data to manufacture this item, AMCs 1 or 2 are valid.(s) AMSC S. Acquisition of this item is restricted to Government approvedsource(s) because the production of this item involves unclassified butmilitarily sensitive technology (see FAR 6.3). If one source is approved,AMCs 3, 4 or 5 are valid. If at least two sources are approved, AMCs 1or 2 are valid.(t) AMSC T. Acquisition of this part is controlled by qualified productslist (QPL) procedures. Competition for this part is limited to sourceswhich are listed on or are qualified for listing on the QPL at the timeof award. (See FAR Part 9 and DFARS Part 9.) AMCs 1 or 2 are valid.(u) AMSC U. The cost to the Government to breakout this part and acquireit competitively has been determined to exceed the projected savings overthe life span of the part. If one source is available, AMCs 3, 4 or 5 arevalid. If at least two sources exist, AMCs 1 or 2 are valid.(v) AMSC V. This part has been designed a high reliability part under aformal reliability program. Probability of failure would be unacceptablefrom the standpoint of safety of personnel and/or equipment. The cognizantengineering activity has determined that data to define and control reliabilitylimits cannot be obtained nor is it possible to draft adequate specificationsfor this purpose. If one source is available, AMCs 3, 4 or 5 are valid.If at least two sources are available, AMCs 1 or 2 are valid.(w) AMSC W. (Reserved)(x) AMSC X. (Not authorized)(y) AMSC Y. The design of this part is unstable. Engineering, requireddesign objectives have not been achieved. Major changes are contemplatedbecause the part has a low process yield or has demonstrated marginal performanceduring tests or service use. These changes will render the present partobsolete and unusable in its present configuration. Limited acquisitionfrom the present source is anticipated pending configuration changes. Ifone source is available, AMCs 3, 4 or 5 are valid. If at least two sourcesexist, AMCs 1 or 2 are valid.(z) AMSC Z. This part is a commercial/non-developmental/off-the-shelf-item.Commercial item descriptions, commercial vendor catalog or price listsor commercial manuals assigned a technical manual number apply. If onesource is available, AMCs 3, 4 or 5 are valid. If at least two sourcesare available, AMCs 1 or 2 are valid.S6-201.3 <T3>Contractor Technical Information Codes. </T3>The following two digitalpha codes shall be used by contractors, when contractor's assistanceis requested. These codes are assigned in accordance with the current versionof MIL-STD-789 and shall be considered during the initial assignment ofan AMC/AMSC. For spare part breakout, requirements for contractor assistancethrough CTIC submission shall be accomplished as stated in Part 4 of thisSupplement. Each CTIC submitted by a contractor must be accompanied bysupporting documentation which justifies the proposed code. These codesand supporting documentation, transmitted by DD Forms 1418 and 1418-1 areuseful not only for code assignment during acquisition coding conferences,but also for personnel conducting both full and limited screening of breakoutcandidates. Personnel conducting full and limited screening of breakoutcandidates should use the supporting documentation provided with CTICsas a source of information. However, they should not allow this informationto substitute for careful analysis and further investigation of the possibilitiesof acquiring a part through competition or by direct purchase. The definitionsfor CTICs are listed below:(a) CTIC CB Source(s) are specified on source control, altered item, orselected item drawings/documents. (The contractor shall furnish a listof the sources with this code.)(b) CTIC CC. Requires engineering source approval by the design controlactivity in order to maintain the quality of the part. An alternate sourcemust qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures,as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity.(c) CTIC CG. There are no technical restrictions to competition.(d) CTIC CK. Produced from class 1 castings (see the current version ofMIL-STD-2175) and similar type forgings. The process of developing andproving the accepability of high-integrity castings and forgings requiresrepetitive performance by a controlled source. Each casting or forgingmust be produced along identical lines to those which resulted in initialacceptabliity of the part. (The contractor shall furnish a list of knownsources for obtaining castings/forgings with this code.)(e) CTIC CM. Master or coordinated tooling is required to produce thispart. This tooling is not owned by the Government or, where owned, cannotbe made available to other sources. (The contractor shall furnish a listof the firms possessing the master or coordinated tooling with this code.)(f) CTIC CN. Requires special and/or inspection facilities to determineand maintain ultra-precision quality for function or system integrity.Substantiation and inspection of the precision or quality cannot be accomplsihedwithout such specialized test or inspection facilities. Other sources inindustry do not possess, nor would it be economically feasible for themto acquire facilities. (The contractor shall furnish a list of the requiredfacilities and their locations with this code.)(g) CTIC CP. The rights to use the data needed to purchase this part fromadditional sources are not owned by the Government and cannot be purchased.(h) CTIC CV. A high reliability part under a formal reliability program.Probability of failure would be unacceptable from the standpoint of safetyof personnel and/or equipment. The cognizant engineering activity has determinedthat data to define and control reliability limits cannot be obtained noris it possible to draft adequate specifications for this purpose. Continuedcontrol by the existing source is necessary to ensure acceptable reliability.(The contractor shall identify the existing source with this code.)(i) CTIC CY. The design of this part is unstable. Engineering, manufacturingor performance characteristics indicate that the required design objectiveshave not been achieved. Major changes are contemplated because the parthas a low process yield or has demonstrated marginal performance duringtests or service use. These changes will render the present part obsoleteand unusable in its present configuration. Limited acquisition from thepresent source is anticipated pending configuration changes. (The contractorshall identify the existing source with this code.)S6-202 <T3>Assignment of Codes. </T3>The purpose of AMC/AMSC assignments is toprovide the best possible technical assessment of how a part can be procured.The technical assessment should not be based on issues such as: are theknown sources actual manufacturers, or are there two actual manufacturersin existence; but rather on factors such as the availability of adequatetechnical data, the Government's rights to use the data, technical restrictionsplaced on the hardware (criticality, reliability, special testing, mastertooling, source approval, ect.) and the cost of breakout vice projectedsavings. In cases where there is additional technical information whichaffects the way a part can be procured, it should be made available tothe contracting officer, with the AMC/AMSC. Concerning the assignment ofAMCs and AMSCs, it is DoD policy that:(a) The assignment of AMC/AMSCs to parts is the responsibility of the DoDComponent introducing the equipment or system for which the parts are neededin the inventory. Subsequent screening is the responsibility of the DoDComponent assigned technical responsibility.(b) When to or more AMSCs apply the most technically restrictive code willbe assigned.(c) Restricted combination of AMC/AMCS are reflected in the AMSC definitions(see S6-201.2). The Defense Logistics Service Center will reject invalidcode combinations, as shown in Exhibit I, submitted for entry into theFederal Catalog Program (see S6-204.2).(d) One-time acquisition of a part by a method other than indicated bythe code does not require a change to the AMC (e.g., when only one of anumber of sources can meet a short delivery date, or when only one manufacturingsource is known but acceptable surplus parts are available from other sources).(e) After the first acquisition pursuant to AMC 2 or 4, the AMC shall berecoded 1 or 3 respectively.(f) Both full and limited screening will result in the assignment or reassignmentof an AMC/AMCS. This assignment shall be based on the best technical judgmentof breakout personnel and on information gathered during the screeningprocess.(g) A part need not be coded as noncompetitive based on an initial marketsurvey which only uncovers one interested source. If the Government hassufficient technical data in its possession to enable other sources tomanufacture an acceptable part, and there are no technical restrictionson the part which would preclude other sources from manufacturing it, thepart should be coded competitive.S6-203 <T3>Improving Part Status.</T3>(a) General. An effective breakout program requires that all reasonableactions be taken to improve the acquisition status of parts. The potentialfor improvement of the acquisition status will vary with individual circumstances.On one end of the spectrum are those parts with acquisition method suffixcodes of a temporary nature requiring vigorous follow-through improvementaction (e.g., AMSCs A and H); on the other end are those parts with codessuggesting a relative degree of permanence (e.g., AMSC P). A code assignedto a part should never be considered fixed with respect to either technicalcircumstance or time; today's technical constraint may be overcome by tommorrow'stechnology and a contractor's rights to data, so zealously protected today,often become less important with time. The application of breakout improvementeffort must always consider individual circumstances and overall benefitsexpected to be obtained.(b) Code Suspense Dates. Every part whose breakout status can be improvedshall be suspensed for rescreening as appropriate. In general, the followingcodes cannot be improved: 1G, 2G, 1K, 2K, 1M, 2M, 1N, 2N, 1T, 2T, 1Z or2Z. The period between suspenses is a period for which the assigned AMC/AMSCis considered active, and routine rescreening of parts with ``valid'' codesis not required. Suspense dates may vary with the circumstance surroundingeach part. A code reached as a result of limited screening (S6-304) shallnot be assigned a suspense date exceeding 12 months; a code reached asa result of full screening (S6-303) shall not be assigned a suspense dateexceeding three years. In exceptional cases, where circumstances indicatethat no change can be expected in a code over an extended period, a suspensedate not exceeding five years may be assigned in accordance with controlsestablished by the breakout activity. Items with a 1G or 2G code do notrequire a suspense date.S6-204 <T3>Communication of Codes.</T3>S6-204.1 <T3>Communication Media.</T3> The Federal Catalog Program formats, setforth in DoD Manual 4100.39-M, ``Defense Integrated Data System (DIDS)Procedural Manual,'' communication media and operating instructions asaugmented by this Supplement shall be employed to disseminate AMCs andAMSCs.S6-204.2 <T3>Responsibilities.</T3>(a) The Defense Logistics Service Center (DLSC) shall:(1) Receive and disseminate AMCs and AMSCs for each National Stock Number(NSN) to all appropriate Government activities in consonance with scheduledFederal Catalog Program computer cycles. (2) Make the AMCs and AMSCs a part of the data bank of NSN item intelligence.(3) Perpetuate the codes in all subsequent Federal Catalog Program transactions;e.g., entry of new NSNs and Federal Supply Code (FSC) changes.(4) Reject invalid code combinations submitted for entry into the FederalCatalog Program.(b) DoD activities responsible for the assignment of AMCs and AMSCs shall:(1) Transmit assigned codes for each NSN through normal cataloging channelsto DLSC under existing Federal Catalog Program procedures.(2) Notify DLSC by normal Federal Catalog Program maintenance procedureswhen a change in coding is made.<ITAG tagnum="84">Part 3_Identification, Selection, and Screening of Parts</ITAG>S6-300 <T3>General</T3>. This part sets forth procedures for the identification,selection and screening of parts.S6-301 <T3>Identification and Selection Procedures.</T3>S6-301.1 <T3>Parts Entering the Inventory.</T3> The breakout process should beginat the earliest possible stage of weapon systems acquisition. Generally,a provisioned part will require subsequent replenishment. Provisioningor similar lists of new parts are, therefore, the appropriate bases forselecting parts for screening. This is not to imply that breakout mustbe done on all items as part of the provisioning process. Priorities shallbe applied to those parts offering the greatest opportunity for breakoutand potential savings. The major factors in making this determination are:(1) the unit price, (2) the projected quantity to be purchased over thepart's life cycle, and (3) the potential for screening to result in a partbeing successfully broken out, e.g. item stability, cost and completenessof technical data, etc.S6-301.2 <T3>Annual Buy Forecasts.</T3> Annually, lists shall be prepared that identifyall parts projected for purchase during the subsequent 12-month period.Priority should be given to those parts with the greatest expected returngiven their annual buy value, life cycle buy value, and likelihood of successfulbreakout, given technical characteristics such as design and performancestability and the availability of technical data. Parts with an expiredsuspense date or a suspense date which will expire during the forecastperiod (see S6-203(b)), need only be subjected to the necessary steps ofthe full screening procedure (see S6-303). Parts with a valid code thatwill not expire during the forecast period need not be screened. Partscoded 0o shall be selected for full screening.S6-301.3 <T3>Immediate Buy Requirements.</T3> An immediate buy requirement willbe identified by the user or the item manager in consonance with DoD Componentregulations. When an immediate buy requirement meeting the screening criteria(see S6-104(b)) is generated for a part not assigned a current AMC/AMSC,the part shall be promptly screened in accordance with either the fullor limited screening procedures (see S6-303 and S6-304).S6.301.4 <T3>Suspect AMC/AMSC.</T3> Whenever AMC/AMSC is suspected to be inaccurate,even by the contracting officer, a rescreening shall be conducted for thatpart. Suspect codes include codes composed of invalid combinations of AMCsand AMSCs, those which do not truely reflect how a part is actually beingprocured, and those suspected of being more restrictive than necessaryfor the next buy.S6-302 <T3>Screening.</T3> (a) Screening procedures include consideration and recording of the relevantfacts pertaining to breakout decisions. The objective of screening is toimprove the acquisition status by determining the potential for competition,or purchase from an actual manufacturer. Consideration of any reasonableapproach to establishing competition should be an integral part of thebreakout process.(b) Screening procedures may vary depending on circumstances related tothe parts. No set rules will provide complete guidance for making acquisitionmethod decisions under all conditions encountered in actual practice. Aninformed coding decision can be made without following the procedures stepby step in every case.(c) Activities involved in screening are encouraged to develop supplementalprocedures which prove effective in meeting this regulation's objectives.These procedures should be tailored to the particular activity's operatingenvironment and the characteristics of the parts for which it is responsible.Nevertheless, care should be taken in all cases to assure that:(1) Responsible judgment is applied to all elements involved in the reviewof a part;(2) The necessary supporting facts are produced, considered and recordedin the breakout screening file. The breakout screening file contains technicaldata and other documents concerning screening of the part;(3) All cost effective alternatives are considered for establishing competition,or purchase from an actual manufacturer (see S6-105d(6));(4) When possible, the sequence of the review allows for accomplishingseveral screening steps concurrently. (d) Contractor participation in the decision-making process extends onlyto providing technical information. This technical information is providedvia the supporting documentation (DD Forms 1418 and 1418-1) which includesthe CTIC assignment. Government personnel shall substantiate the breakoutdecision by reference to the CTIC and by careful review of the supportingdocumentation. However, the CTIC provides guidance only, and it shouldbe used as one of the inputs to arrive at an acceptable AMC and AMSC coding.(e) Contractor's technical information furnished in accordance with MIL-STD-789may indicate areas requiring additional research by the Government beforescreening can be completed. Seldom will industry's contribution to thescreening process enable the Government to assign an AMC or an AMSC withoutadditional review.(f) During the screening process, it may be appropriate to communicationwith industry, particularly potential manufacturers of a part, to determinethe feasibility of establishing a competitive source and to estimate thecosts and technical risks involved. (g) Coding conference with industry shall be documented. (h) Screening may disclose a part is not suitable for competitive acquisition,but it may be possible to breakout the part for direct purchase from theactual manufacturer or to establish a second source. Parts particularlysuited to direct purchase are those where neither the design control activitynor the prime contractor contribute additional value or whose data belongto the actual manufacturer and will not be acquired by the Government,and where that manufacturer exercises total responsibility for the part(design and quality control, testing, etc.), and where additional operationsperformed by the prime contractor can be performed by the actual manufactureror by the Government.(i) For each part that is screened, a file shall be established to documentand justify the decisions and results of all screening effort. (See S6-105(d)(6).)(j) Full and limited screening procedures are two elements of breakoutprograms. Other spare parts initiatives to enhance breakout are reverseengineering, bailment, data rights challenges and publication of intendedbuy lists. Integration of other initiatives within the screening processesdeveloped at each activity is encouraged.S6-303 <T3>Full Screening Procedures.</T3> (a) Full screening procedures should be developed so that the potentialis fully evaluated for establishing competition or purchase from an actualmanufacturer. Also, full screening procedures should facilitate accurateand consistent acquisition method code assignment. It is expected thateach activity will develop its own operational screening procedures. Ageneral model, full screening decision process is provided below to supportthe development of activity level procedures and to provide guidance regardingthe general scope of these procedures. The full screening procedures involve65 steps in the decision process, and are divided into the following phases:(1) Data Collection;(2) Data Evaluation;(3) Data Completion;(4) Technical Evaluation; (5) Economic Evaluation; and(6) Supply Feedback.(b) The six phases listed above describe different functions that mustbe achieved during screening. The nature of the screening process doesnot permit clear distinction of one phase from another. Further, the orderof performance of these phases may not correspond to the order listed here.In fact, these phases will often overlap and may be performed simultaneously.Their purpose is to identify the different functions comprising the screeningprocess.(c) A summary flow chart of the decision steps is provided as Exhibit IIto assist in understanding the logical order of the full screening stepsfor various conditions. Use of the flow chart in connection with the textthat follows is essential to fully understand the order of the steps inthe process.S6-303.1 <T3> Data Collection Phase (Step 1).</T3>(a) <T3>Step 1.</T3> Assemble all available data and establish a file for eachpart. Collect identification data, relevant data obtained from industry,contracting and technical history data and current status of the part,including:(1) Normal identification required for cataloging and standardization review.(2) All known sources.(3) Historical contracting information, including the more recent awards,and unit price(s) for the quantities prescribed.(4) Identification of the actual manufacturer(s), his latest unit priceand the quantity on which the price is based. (When the actual manufactureris not the design control activity, the design control activity may beconsulted to ensure the latest version of the item is being procured fromthe actual manufacturer.)(5) Identification of the activity, Government or industry, having designcontrol over the part and, if industry, the cognizant Government engineeringactivity.(6) The expected life in the military supply system.(7) Record of any prior review for breakout, with results or findings.(8) Annual demand.(b) In the case of complex items requiring large numbers of drawings, collectionof a reasonable technical data sample is sufficient for the initial technicaldata evaluation phase (Steps 2-14).S6-303.2 <T3>Data Evaluation Phase (Steps 2-14).</T3>(a) Data evaluation is crucial to the whole review procedure. It involvesdetermination of the adequacy of the technical data package and the Government'srights to use the data for acquisition purposes.(b) The data evaluation process may be divided into two stages:(1) A brief but intensive analysis of available data and documents regardingboth technical matters and data rights, leading to a decision whether toproceed with screening; and(2) If the decision is to proceed with screening, further work is necessaryto produce an adequate technical data package, such as research of contractprovisions, engineering work on data and drawings, and requests to contractorsfor additional data.(c) The steps in this phase are:(1) <T3>Step 2.</T3> Are full Government rights established by the availabledata package? Evidence for an affirmative answer would include the identificationof Government drawings, incorporation by reference of Government specificationsor process descriptions in the public domain, or reference to contractprovisions giving the Government unlimited rights to data. If the answeris negative, proceed to Step 3; if positive, proceed to Step 6.(2) <T3>Step 3.</T3> Are the contractor's limitations on use of rights to dataestablished by the available data package?A. The questions above (Steps 2 and 3) are not exclusive. The incorporationin a drawing of contract provisions reserving rights to the manufacturer,either in the whole design or in certain manufacturing processes, wouldestablish a clear affirmative answer to Step 3 where there is substantiatingGovernment documentation. Parts not in this group shall be retained forfurther processing (see Step 20). Data rights that cannot be substantiatedshall be challenged.B. In the case of clear contractor ownership of rights, proceed with Steps4 and 5.(3) <T3>Step 4.</T3> Are there bases for competitive acquisition without usingdata subject to limitations on use? This question requires consideration,for example, of the possibility of using performance specifications orsubstitution of military or commercial specifications or bulletins forlimited elements of the manufacturing process. The use of sample copiesis another possibility.(4) <T3>Step 5.</T3> Can the Government buy the necessary rights to data? Thisis a preliminary question to the full analysis (in Steps 20 and 21 below)and is designed primarily to eliminate from further consideration thoseitems which incorporate established data restrictions and for which thereare no other bases for competitive acquisition nor is purchase of rightspossible or feasible.(5) <T3>Steps 6 and 7.</T3> Is the present technical data package adequatefor competitive acquisition of a reliable part? <T3>Steps 8 and 9.</T3> Specify omissions. This question requires a criticalengineering evaluation and should deal first with the physical completenessof the data_are any essential dimensions, tolerances, processes, finishes,material specifications, or other vital elements of data lacking from thepackage? If so, these omissions should be specified. A second element dealswith adequacy of the existing package to produce a part of the requiredperformance, compatibility, quality and reliability. This will, of course,be related to the completeness of data. In some cases, qualified engineeringjudgment may decide that in spite of apparently complete data, the highperformance or other critical characteristics of the item require retentionof the present source. If such decision is made, the file shall includedocumentation in the form of specific information, such as difficultiesexperienced by the present manufacturer in producing a satisfactory itemor the existence of unique production skills in the present source.(6) <T3>Steps 10 and 11.</T3> Can the data be developed to make up a reliabletechnical data package? This implies a survey of the specified omissionswith careful consideration to determine the resources available to supplyeach missing element. Such resources will vary from simple referencingof standard engineering publications to more complex development of drawingswith the alternatives of either obtaining such drawings or developing performancespecifications. In some cases, certain elements of data are missing becausethey have been properly restricted. If, however, there has been no advancesubstantiation of the right to restrict, the part should be further researched.If the answer to this question is negative, proceed to Step 12; if positive,proceed to Steps 13 or 14.(7) <T3>Step 12.</T3> If the answer to the question in Steps 10 and 11 is no,which condition is the prime element in this decision, the lack of dataor the unreliability of the data? Specific documentation is needed to supportthis decision.(8) <T3>Steps 13 and 14.</T3> Estimate the time required to complete the datapackage. In those cases where the data package is found inadequate andspecific additions need to be developed, an estimate of the time requiredfor completion must be made in order to determine if breakout of the partis feasible during this review cycle and to estimate at what point in theremaining life of the part the data package could be available.S6-303.3 <T3>Data Completion Phase (Steps 15-21).</T3>(a) The data completion phase involves acquiring or developing the missingelements of information to reach a determination on both adequacy of thetechnical data package and the restriction of rights to data. It may involvevarious functional responsibilities, such as examination of past contracts,queries directed to industry or to other Government Agencies, inspectionof the part, reverse or other engineering work to develop drawings andwrite specifications, arrangements with the present source for licensingor technical assistance to new manufacturers, and negotiations for purchaseof rights to data. Additional research and information requests shouldbe expeditiously initiated on those parts where there is a reasonable expectationof breakout. Because this phase is time-consuming, it should take placeconcurrently with other phases of the review.(b) At the beginning of the data completion phase, the part falls intoone of four steps as follows:(1) <T3>Step 15.</T3> The data package is complete and adequate and the Governmenthas full rights to use it for acquisition purposes. Such parts requireno further data analysis. Proceed to Step 22.(2) <T3>Step 16.</T3> The Government has full rights to use existing data.The data package is incomplete but there is a reasonable expectation thatthe missing elements can be supplied. Proceed to Step 19.(3) <T3>Step 17.</T3> The data package is complete, but full Government rightsto the data have not been established. Proceed to Step 20.(4) <T3>Step 18.</T3> Neither rights nor completeness of data is adequatelyestablished; therefore, the part requires further research. Proceed toStep 20.(c) <T3>Step 19.</T3> Obtain or develop the necessary data for a reliable datapackage. Reverse engineering to develop acquisition data may be employed(see DFARS 27.403-2) if there is a clear indication that the costs of reverseengineering will be less than the savings anticipated from competitiveacquisition. If there is a choice between reverse engineering and the purchaseof data (Step 21), the decision shall be made on the basis of relativecosts, quality, time, and other pertinent factors.(d) <T3>Step 20.</T3> Establish the Government's and the contractor's rightsto the data. Where drawings and data cannot be identified to a contract,the following guidelines should be applied:(1) Where drawings and data bear legends which warn of copyright or patentrights, the effect of such legends shall be resolved according to law andpolicy; however, the existence of patent or copyright restrictions doesnot per se preclude securing competition with respect to the parts described(see FAR/DFARS 27.3).(2) Where drawings and data bear legends which state limitations on theiruse for reacquisition purposes, and it is determined that a question reasonablyexists as to whether such limitations on use were properly affixed to thedrawings or data, initiate action to challenge the contractor as to thereasons for limitations. Use of the drawings and data shall be in accordancewith the decision.(3) Where drawings and data are unmarked and therefore free of limitationon their use, they shall be considered available for use in acquisition,unless the acquiring office has clear evidence to the contrary (see DFARS27.403-3(d)).(4) The decision process in situations described in (1), (2), and (3) requiresthe exercise of sound discretion and judgment and embraces legal considerations.In no case shall a decision be made without review and approval of thatdecision by legal counsel.(5) If analysis fails to establish that any of the drawings and data areproperly restricted to the present source or manufacturer, the Governmentshall attempt to obtain competition pursuant to the decisions resultingfrom concurrent technical and economic evaluation.(e) <T3/><T3>Step 21.</T3> If restrictions on the use of data are established, determinewhether the Government can buy rights to the required data. The procedurein DFARS 27.403-2(f) for the purchase of unlimited rights to data shallbe followed when it is planned to purchase data with unlimited right forcompetitive acquisition.S6-303.4 <T3>Technical Evaluation Phase (Steps 22-37).</T3>(a) Introduction.(1) The purposes of technical evaluation are to determine the developmentstatus, design stability, high performance, and/or critical characteristicssuch as safety of personnel and equipment; the reliability and effectiveoperation of the system and equipment in which the parts are to be used;and to exercise technical judgment as to the feasibility of breaking outthe parts. No simple and universal rules apply to each determination, andthe application of experience and responsible judgment is required. Technicalconsiderations arise in several elements of the decision process, e.g.,in determining adequacy of the data package (Steps 6-14).(2) Certain manufacturing conditions may reduce the field of potentialsources. However, these conditions do not justify the restriction of competitionby the assignment of restrictive AMCs for the following reasons:(i) Parts Produced From Class 1 Castings and Similar Type Forgings: Theprocess of developing and proving the acceptability of high-integrity castingsand forgings requires repetitive performance by a controlled source foreach casting or forging along identical lines to those which result ininitial acceptability of the item. The particular manufacturer's processbecomes the controlling factor with regard to the acceptability of anysuch item. However, other firms can produce class 1 castings and similartype forgings and provide the necessary inspection, or the part may beprocured from other sources which use castings or forgings obtained fromapproved (controlled) source(s).(ii) Parts Produced From Master or Coordinated Tooling, e.g., NumericallyControlled Tapes: Such parts have features (contoured surfaces, hole locations,etc.) delineated according to unique master tooling or tapes and are manufacturedto min/max limits and must be replaceable without additional tailoringor fitting. These parts cannot be manufactured or configured by a secondarypattern or jigs independent of the master tooling and cannot be manufacturedto requisite tolerances of fit by use of commercial precision machinery.In this context, jigs and fixtures used only for ease of production arenot considered master tooling. However, master tooling may be reproduced.(iii) Parts Requiring Special Test and/or Inspection Facilities to Determineand Maintain Ultra-Precision Quality for the Function or System Integrity:Substantiation and inspection of the precision or quality cannot be accomplishedwithout specialized test or inspection facilities. Testing is often doneby the actual manufacturer under actual operating use. However, such specialtest inspection facilities may be available at other firms.(b) Design Procedures (Steps 22-31)(1) <T3>Step 22.</T3> Will a design change occur during anticipated lead time?If affirmative, proceed to Step 23; if negative, proceed to Step 24. <T3>Step 23.</T3> Specify the design change and assign an appropriate code.<T3>Step 24.</T3> Is a satisfactory part now being produced? Concurrentlywith the research and completion of data, a technical determination isrequired as to the developmental status of the part. With the frequenttelescoping of the development/production cycle as well as constant productimprovement throughout the active life of equipment, parts are frequentlysubject to design changes. The present source, if a prime contractor, isusually committed to incorporate the latest changes in any deliveries undera production order. In considering the part for breakout, an assessmentmust be made of the stability of design, so that in buying from a new sourcethe Government will not be purchasing an obsolete or incompatible part.The question of obsolescence or noncompatibility is to some extent underGovernment control. Screening for breakout on parts that are anticipatedto undergo design change should be deferred until design stability is attained.(2) <T3>Step 25. </T3>Can a satisfactory part be produced by a new source?Determine whether technical reasons prohibit seeking a new source. Thefact that the present source has not yet been able to produce a satisfactorypart (Step 24) does not preclude another source from being successful.If the answer to Steps 24 or 25 is affirmative, proceed simultaneouslyto Steps 27 and 38. If the answer to Step 25 is negative, proceed to Step26. (3) <T3>Step 26. </T3>If the present source is producing an unsatisfactorypart, but technical reasons prohibit seeking a new source, specify thereasons. (4) <T3>Step 27. </T3>Does the part require prior qualifications or other approvaltesting? If the answer is positive, proceed to Step 28; if negative, proceedto Step 32. <T3>Step 28. </T3>Specify the requirement. <T3>Step 29. </T3>Estimate the time required to qualify a new source. <T3>Step 30. </T3>Is there currently a qualified source? <T3>Step 31. </T3>Who is responsible for qualification_the subcontractor,present prime contractor, the Government, or an independent testing agency?i. If a qualified source is currently in existence, the review should considerwho will be responsible for qualification in the event of competitive acquisition.If qualification teting is such that it can be performed by the selectedsource under a preproduction or first article clause in the contract, thecosts of initial approval should be reflected in the offers received. Ifthe part requires initial qualification tests by some other agency suchas the present prime contractor, the Government, an independent testingagent outside the Government, or by technical facilities within the MilitaryServices, out-of-pocket costs may be incurred if the part is competed.An estimate of qualification costs should then be made and recorded insuch cases. ii. Where facilities within the Government are not adequate for testingor qualification, or outside agencies such as the equipment contractorcannot or will not do the job, the economics of qualification may be unreasonable,and a narrative statement of these facts should replace the cost estimate.Whenever possible, such as in the case of engine qualification tests, economyof combined qualification tests should be considered. (c) Quality Assurance Procedures (Steps 32-33). Quality control and inspectionis a primary consideration when making a decision to breakout. Where theprime contractor performs quality assurance functions beyond those of thepart manufacturer or other sources, the Government may: (1) develop the same quality control and inspection capability in the manufacturer'splant; (2) assume the responsibility for quality; or (3) undertake to obtain the quality assurance services from another source,possibly the prime contractor. (4) <T3>Step 32. </T3>Who is now responsible for quality control and inspectionof the part? <T3>Step 33. </T3>Can a new source be assigned responsibility for qualitycontrol? Is the level of the quality assurance requirements specified inthe system contract necessary for the screened part? The minimum qualityassurance procedures for each part shall be confirmed. i. A new source shall be considered if: (A) Any essential responsibility (e.g. burn-in, reliability, maintainability)retained by the prime contractor for the part and its relationship to theend item can be eliminated, shifted to the new source, or assumed by theGovernment; or (B) the prime contractor will provide the needed quality assurance services;or (C) the Government can obtain competent, impartial services to performquality assurance responsibility; or (D) the new source can maintain an adequate quality assurance program,inspection system, or inspection appropriate for the part. ii. If the prime contractor has responsibility for quality that a new sourcecannot assume or obtain, or that the Government cannot undertake or eliminate,consideration of the new source is precluded. (d) Tooling Procedures (Steps 34-37). <T3>Step 34. Is tooling or other special equipment required? </T3><T3>Step 35. </T3>Specify the type of tooling. <T3>Step 36. </T3>Estimate additional acquisition lead time for setup andfor tooling. <T3>Step 37. </T3>Does the Government possess this tooling? If toolingor special equipment is required for production of the part, the typesand quantities should be specified. Investigation can then be made as towhether the Government possesses such tooling and can make it availableto a new source. A requirement for special tooling is not necessarily adeterrent to competitive solicitation for parts. The Government may findit desirable to purchase the needed tooling and furnish it to the new source.In this case, the costs can be determined with reasonable accuracy. However,if new sources can provide the tooling or special equipment, this willbe reflected in competitive prices and should not normally require furtheranalysis. S6-303.5 <T3>Economic Evaluation Phase (Steps 38-56). </T3>(a) Economic evaluation concerns identification and estimation of breakoutsavings and direct cost offsets to breakout. The economic evaluation phaseis composed of the three segments detailed in (b) through (d) below. (b) Development of Savings Data (Steps 38-40). <T3>Step 38. </T3>Estimate remaining program life cycle buy value. <T3>Step 39. </T3>Apply either a savings factor of 25% or one determinedunder local conditions and experience. <T3>Step 40. </T3>Multiply the remaining program life cycle buy value bythe savings factor to obtain the expected future savings, if the part iscoded for breakout. (c) Computation of Breakout Costs (Steps 41-47). Several groups of costsmust be collected, summarized and compared to estimated savings to properlydetermine the economics of breakout. These costs include:(1) Direct Costs (Steps 41-45). Direct costs of breakout normally includeall expenditures which are direct and wholly identifiable to a specific,successful breakout action, and which are not reflected in the part unitprice. Examples of direct costs include Government tooling or special testequipment, qualification testing, quality control expenses, and industryparticipation costs (such as completion of the Contractor Technical InformationData Record) if borne by the Government. <T3>Step 41.</T3> Estimate the cost to the Government for tooling or specialequipment.<T3>Step 42.</T3> Estimate the cost, if any, to the Government for qualifyingthe new source. <T3>Step 43.</T3> Estimate the cost, if any, to the Government for assuringquality control, or the cost of contracting for quality control. <T3>Step 44.</T3> Estimate the cost to the Government for purchasing rightsto data. <T3>Step 45.</T3> Add estimated total direct costs to the Government tobreakout the item.   (2) Performance Specification Costs (Step 46-47). <T3>Step 46.</T3> Is the breakout candidate constructed to a performancespecification? <T3>Step 47.</T3> If so, add performance specification breakout cost elementslisted below to the result of Step 45.  i. The addition of an unknown number of nonstocked parts which must bestocked by the supply system for repairs is a significant element of costassociated with the decision to compete a performance specification assembly.(The same situation does not arise with respect to a design specificationassembly since virtually all spare parts used to repair such an assemblyare exact copies of parts already in the assembly.) The cost of introducingthese nonstocked parts into the system includes:(A) Additional catalog costs. The number of nonstocked parts forecastedto be in the complete assembly, multiplied by the variable cost of catalogingper line item.  (B) Additional bin opening costs. The number of nonstocked parts forecastedto be in the completed assembly, multiplied by the variable cost of a binopening at each of the locations where the part is to be stocked. (C) Additional management costs. The number of nonstocked parts forecastedto be in the completed assembly, multiplied by the variable cost of managementper line item.  (D) Additional technical data costs. The cost of a new set of technicaldata for the completed assembly, including the variable expenses of itsproduction, reproduction, and distribution. (E) Additional repair tools and test equipment costs. The costs of additionalspecial tools and test equipment not otherwise required by the existingassembly.  (F Additional logistics support costs. The costs associated with the newitem such as spare and repair parts, technical manuals, and training. (d) Comparision of Savings and Costs (Step 48-56). Compare estimated breakoutcosts to forecasted breakout savings. If costs exceed estimated savings,it will be uneconomical to compete the part. Performance specificationparts should be analyzed to ensure that pertinent breakout costs have beenconsidered and, if it is not economical to breakout the part, whether anappropriate design specification package reduces costs sufficiently tomake breakout economical.  (1) <T3>Step 48</T3>. Compare total costs of breakout (Step 47) to estimatedsavings (Step 40).  (2) <T3>Step 49</T3>. Are costs of breakout greater or less than estimatedsaving? If greater, proceed to Step 50; if less, proceed to Step 57.  (3) <T3>Step 50</T3>. Is the breakout candidate constructed to a performancespecification? If no, proceed to Step 54; if yes, proceed to Step 51. (4) <T3>Step 51</T3>. Is it appropriate to obtain a design specification package?Is yes, proceed to Step 52; if no, proceed to Step 54. The decision tochange a performance specification part to a design specification partobviously requires a critical engineering examination of the part itself,as well as a review of the impact such a change might have on the operationaleffectiveness of the system in which the equipment is to be employed. Procurementof a performance specification part by a subsequently acquired design specificationsubjects the Government to the additional hazard of losing the money paidfor the development of the design specification, should the design be alteredduring the procurement lead time period. Accordingly, the engineering evaluationshould closely review design stability over the anticipated procurementlead time in order to avoid procuring an obsolete or nonstandard part ifthe decision is made to compete it.  (5) <T3>Step 52</T3>. Add the estimated cost of obtaining a design specificationpackage to the results of Step 45.  (6) <T3>Step 53</T3>. If the results of step 52 are less than the estimatedsavings, initiate action to obtain a design specification package. Proceedto Step 54 to code the part for a period until it can be rescreened usingthe design specification package. The code determined in this screeningshall be assigned a suspense date commensurate with the lead time requiredto obtain the design specification package (see S6-203(b)).  (7) <T3>Step 54</T3>. Is the part manufactured by the prime contractor? Ifyes, code the part AMC 3; if no, proceed to Step 55.  (8) <T3>Step 55</T3>. Can the part be acquired directly from the actual manufacturer?If no, proceed to Step 56; if yes, code the part AMC 3 or 4, as applicable. (9) <T3>Step 56</T3>. Specify the reasons for inability to obtain the partfrom the actual manufacturer. Code the part AMC 5.S6-303.6 <T3>Supply Feedback Phase (Steps 57-65). </T3>(a) The supply feedback phase of the analysis is the final screening phasefor breakout parts. This phase is completed for all AMC 2 parts to determineif sufficient time is available to breakout on the immediate buy and tocommunicate this information to the inventory manager responsible for therequirement. Forst, all additional time factors required to breakout thepart are added. Total time is subtracted from the immediate and futurebuy date and the result compared to the current date. (Note: Not all timefactors listed apply to each part screened.) If the result is the sameor earlier than the required contract date, the part is coded competitiveand action is begun to qualify additional sources as necessary. If theresult is later than the required contract date, action to compete theimmediate buy quantity should be initiated if the inventory manager canfind some means of accepting later delivery. If this is impossible, theappropriate records should be annotated for competitive acquisition ofthe next replenishment buy quantity. If late delivery is acceptable, theinventory manager should compute requirements for the part and initatean appropriate purchase requisition. (b) Procedures. (1) <T3>Step 57. </T3>Add all additional time factors required to breakoutthe part (Steps 13, 14, 29, 36). (2) <T3>Step 58. </T3>Add the results of Step 57 to the date of this review.(3) <T3>Step 59. </T3>Compare the result of Step 58 to the date that the contractor order must be placed. (4) <T3>Step 60. </T3>Is the result of Step 59 earlier than, later than, orthe same as the contract or order date? (If earlier or the same, proceedto Step 61; if later, to Step 63.) (5) <T3>Step 61. </T3>Can supply accept late delivery? If yes, go to Step 62;if no, go to Step 63. (6) <T3>Step 62. </T3>Notify the inventory manager to compute requirementsand initiate a purchase requisition. Go to Step 64. (7) <T3>Step 63. </T3>Code the part AMC 2. Insufficient time to compete onthis buy. (8) <T3>Step 64. </T3>Code the part AMC 2. (9) <T3>Step 65. </T3>Begin actions to qualify new sources, if required andpossible. S6-304 <T3>Limited Screening Procedures. </T3>(a) Limited screening procedures are only appropriate when the full screeningprocess cannot be completed for a part in sufficient time to support animmediate buy requirement. If limited screening does not result in a competitiveAMC and the part is characterized by a high buy value and high buy quantityin the annual buy forecast, full screening procedures shall be immediatelyinitiated. (b) Limited screening procedures cover only the essential points of dataand technical evaluations more completely described in full screening procedures(see S6-303). Extensive legal review of rights or technical review of datais not required; nor is back-up information on type and extent of qualificationtesting, quality control procedures and master tooling required. A summaryflow chart of the limited screening decision steps is provided at ExhibitIII. (c) The limited screening decision steps are followed sequentially if theanswer to the question in each step is affirmative. If any step is answeredin the negative, proceed directly to Step 10. (1) <T3>Step 1. </T3>Assemble all available data and establish a file for eachpart. Collect identification data, relevant data obtained from industry,contracting and technical history data and current status of the part (seeS6-303.1)(2) <T3>Step 2. </T3>Do the available documents establish full Government rightsto use the data for acquisition purposes? If the Government's rights touse data in its possession is questionable, resolution of the rights mustcontinue beyond award of the immediate buy. (3) <T3>Step 3. </T3>Is the data package sufficient, accurate and legible?If the Government does not have in its possession sufficient, accurateor legible data, action shall be promptly initiated to resolve the deficiencyfor the next buy. (4) <T3>Step 4. </T3>Is the design of the part stable over the anticipatedacquisition leadtime?(5) <T3>Step 5. </T3>Is a satisfactory part now being produced? (6) <T3>Step 6. </T3>Can the part be acquired from a new source without priorqualification testing or other approval testing? (7) <T3>Step 7. </T3>Can the Government or a new source be responsible forquality assurance? (8) <T3>Step 8. </T3>Can the part be manufactured without master or coordinatedtooling or other special equipment; if no, is there more than one sourcewhich has the tooling or special equipment? (9) <T3>Step 9. </T3>Assign AMC 2. Proceed to Step 11.(10) <T3>Step 10. </T3>Assign AMC 3, 4 or 5, as appropriate. (11) <T3>Step 11. </T3>Establish the date of the next review (see S6-104(c)and S6-203(b)).<ITAG tagnum="81">Part 4_Contractor's Assistance </ITAG>S6-400 <T3>General. </T3>(a) Contractor's assistance in screening shall be requested on selectedparts only after consideration of the benefit expected from the contractor'stechnical information and the cost to the Government of obtaining suchassistance. (b) Contractor's assistance shall not be requested for parts covered byGovernment/Industry specifications, commercially available parts or partsfor which data is already available. (c) Arrangements entered into with contractor to obtain technical informationshall provide that (i) contractors will exert their best effort to makeimpartial technical evaluations using applicable technical data and theexperience of competent personnel, and (ii) no costs to the Governmentwill be incurred for duplicate screening of parts. S6-401 <T3>Contractor's Technical Evaluation Procedures. </T3>(a) Contractor's technical evaluation for the screening process shall berequired contractually by incorporating MIL-STD-789, which delineates thecontractor's responsibilities and procedures and prescribes use of thecontractor Technical Information Record, DD Form 1418, and the TechnicalData Identification Checklist, DD 1418-1, a copy of each document listedon DD Form 1418-1, and other substantive data that was used in developingthe contractor's recommendations. (b) When MIL-STD-789 is incorporated in a contract, the Contract Data RequirementsList, DD Form 1423, shall specify the requirement for the submission ofDD Form 1418 and DD Form 1418-1 in accordance with MIL-STD-789. <ITAG tagnum="81">Part 5_Reporting System </ITAG>S6-500 <T3>General. </T3>This part prescribes reports regarding the breakout programwhich cannot be obtained from other sources. These reports are used toevaluate the effectiveness of breakout programs, establish a baseline forall spare part acquisitions, and identify trends in spare parts acquisition.S6-501 <T3>Reports.</T3>(a) Spare Parts Breakout Screening Report (RCS DD Pandamp;L(Qandamp;SA) 714A).This is a cumulative semi-annual report reflecting the accomplishmentsof the breakout program. The report describes the results of full and limitedscreening for provisioning and replenishment parts by number of differentNSNs for each AMC. Each DoD Component shall also maintain actual cost dataattributable to the Spare Parts Breakout Program which shall be forwardedon this report semi-annually.(b) Spare Parts Acquisition Report (RCS DD Pandamp;L(Qandamp;SA) 714B). Thisis a cumulative semi-annual report for all purchases made of spare partsduring the current fiscal year. This report describes the number and extendeddollar value of different NSNs purchased for each AMC. Each DoD Componentshall also maintain actual savings (or cost avoidance) data attributableto the Spare Parts Breakout Program which shall be forwarded on this reportsemi-annually. Because of extraneous factors such as procurement leadtimesand changes in spare parts requirements, this report will not always reflectthe acquisition of the parts screened during a reporting period (containedon the Spare Parts Breakout Screening Report). Also, it will not show inall instances how the part was actually procured. This report is intendedto be an indication of the success of the breakout program, and designedto show trends in the coding and data available to buyers in the procurementpackage.
