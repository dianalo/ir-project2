The new jury was not told that U.S. District Judge Mary JohnsonLowe had declared mistrials on Jan. 10 and March 22 in the caseagainst the Wayne, N.J.-based chemicals and building materialsmanufacturer and its vice chairman, James T. Sherwin.   Arthur L. Liman, lead attorney for GAF, addressed the 12-memberpanel in federal court in Manhattan after an hour-long openingstatement by Assistant U.S. Attorney Carl Loewenson Jr.   Loewenson told the jury that Sherwin persuaded a Los Angelesbrokerage firm to illegally drive up Union Carbide Corp.'s stockprice in October 1986 so that GAF _ which had accumulated 10million shares in a failed takeover bid _ could unload it at abetter price.   Liman denied GAF was desperate to get rid of the stock. He saidGAF Chairman and Chief Executive Samuel J. Heyman was ``verybullish, very optimistic'' about the future of Union Carbide.   Liman said the government's case depends on the testimony of anadmitted felon, Los Angeles stockbroker Boyd L. Jefferies, who hasbeen testifying as part of a plea arrangement.   Jefferies has testified twice that Sherwin induced him tomanipulate the stock and to hide the transaction.   ``You have the power to keep Boyd Jefferies from pulling thewool over your eyes and from perpetrating any misjustice,'' Limansaid.   The lawyer claimed Jefferies has rehearsed his testimony atleast 25 times with government lawyers. ``The only thing theydidn't do is have him practice in front of a mirror,'' he said.   Loewenson conceded there will be inconsistencies in thetestimony of Jefferies and his chief trader, James Melton. If theirrecollections matched perfectly, he told the jury, ``you'd knowthat they cooked up a story together.''   GAF, two subsidiaries and Sherwin were indicted in July 1988 oncharges of securities fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy.   The companies would face maximum fines totaling $12 million, or$500,000 on each of eight counts against each of the three. Sherwinwould face 40 years in prison and a fine of up to $2 million.   The GAF case was the first criminal trial stemming from theinsider trading scandals of the mid-1980s and were considered acritical test of information supplied by jailed stock speculatorIvan F. Boesky.   Jefferies was implicated in the scandal by Boesky and pleadedguilty to two securities fraud felonies. Earlier this year,Jefferies was sentenced to probation and fined $250,000.</TEXT></DOC>
