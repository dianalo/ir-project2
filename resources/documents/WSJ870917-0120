The commission, in a 4-1 vote yesterday, decided to sound out the public on the proposal after the SEC's directors of enforcement, market regulation and corporate finance contended that such purchases, known on Wall Street as &quot;sweeping the market,&quot; subvert the shareholder-protection rules under the Williams Act, which governs tender offers.    The proposal, if adopted, would prohibit a corporate raider from canceling a tender offer and then immediately buying a controlling block of stock on the open market, primarily from arbitragers. This takeover tactic was used successfully by Campeau Corp. last fall when it acquired 48% of Allied Stores Corp. within a half hour of the termination of its tender offer. The huge Allied stake had been amassed by Jefferies andamp; Co., a Los Angeles-based brokerage firm.    The proposed rule also would prevent market sweeps by a friendly suitor intent on rescuing a besieged company, SEC officials said. At the same time, a target company wouldn't be allowed to buy substantial amounts of its own stock on the open market during a takeover battle. Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc. used such a defensive strategem in 1984 to ward off a hostile bid by another retailer, Limited Inc.    At yesterday's meeting, SEC staff members said that market sweeps during or shortly after takeover bids constitute illegal tender offers, which force shareholders to sell their stock in a highly pressured atmosphere or miss out on premium prices being paid to arbitragers.    &quot;The Williams Act was intended to ensure all shareholders -- and not just the arbs and clients of Jefferies -- (market) information and a fair and equal opportunity to participate in tender offers,&quot; asserted Linda Quinn, corporate finance director. Added enforcement chief Gary Lynch: &quot;We believe market sweeps are abusive.&quot;    Under the law, bidders must give holders 20 business days to evaluate and respond to bids, and they must offer the same tender-offer terms to all holders.    Commissioner Charles Cox cast the only vote in opposition to the proposal, which would impose a cooling-off period on bidders after the termination of tender offers. The proposed rule would, with certain exceptions, prohibit open-market purchases or privately negotiated transactions that increase the holdings of the initial bidder or any other purchaser by 10% or more of a company's stock during a formal tender offer or for 10 business days after the offer's expiration date.    In addition, a bidder who announces takeover intentions but doesn't make a formal offer within five business days would be required to wait 30 business days before making open-market purchases. In this case, however, the bidder could still proceed by making a formal offer.    The proposal received strenuous objections from the SEC's senior economists, Kenneth Lehn and Jeffry Davis. They took sharp issue with the argument that shareholders are financially harmed by market sweeps. Mr. Lehn urged the SEC to take a case-by-case approach on open-market purchases. But other staff members said that the SEC has lost out in the courts whenever it intervenes in market-sweep cases.    At yesterday's meeting, the SEC unanimously voted to require registered investment advisers to disclose to a client whether they are in a &quot;precarious&quot; financial condition. They are also required to disclose any felony convictions, civil injunctions, SEC sanctions or disciplinary actions by stock exchanges against them.    Separately, in a 3-2 vote, the commission decided against seeking public comment on a staff proposal designed to improve the disclosure of trades by officers, directors and other so-called insiders in their company's stock. The proposal would have required companies to report such transactions to the SEC if the insiders failed to file the personal disclosure forms in a timely manner, as currently required.    Chairman David Ruder directed the staff to devise an alternative proposal. </TEXT></DOC>
