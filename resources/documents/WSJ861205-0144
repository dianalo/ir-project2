That's not surprising in a general sense, because Boris Becker turned 19 just two weeks ago. From a tennis standpoint, however, it's big news.    &quot;I've learned that tennis is not just hitting the ball. It's thinking, too,&quot; declares the big, bouncy blond, who is plying his trade here this week in the eight-man Nabisco Masters tourney at Madison Square Garden. &quot;Before, I'd get frustrated after I lost a set or played a stupid point. Now I can do that and still think clearly. I understand that it's the guy who gets the last point that wins.&quot;    Young Mr. Becker has won the last point in his last four tournaments, at Atlanta, Paris, Tokyo and Sydney. In July, he was king of the hill for the second straight time at Wimbledon, which despite its archaic grass surface is considered tennis's unofficial world championship. He is ranked No. 2 to Ivan Lendl by the computer that decides such things, but he has beaten Lendl three times in four matches this year, all of them finals.    In brief, Becker is one baby who has come a long way, and fast. In 1984, his first year on the pro tour, he was ranked a lowly 65th. In 1985, at age 17, he surprised (nay, shocked) Wimbledon with a collection of cannon serves, volleys and baseline shots that seemed to defy the law of gravity, but he didn't face tennis's then Big Three of Lendl, John McEnroe and Jimmy Connors en route to his title there, and could muster only one other tour triumph that year.    In 1986, his tournament victory total has climbed to seven, and his victims have included the famous, unfamous and infamous. In the last category, he twice knocked off McEnroe in the Atlanta round robin last week.    Becker's commercial development has proceeded apace. Under the management of glowering former pro Ion Tiriac, a tiger who wears a necktie, he has become a spokesman and poster boy for such world-wide enterprises as Coca-Cola and Deutsche Bank, along with his more-traditional sporting tie to Puma, a maker of tennis shoes, clothes and racquets.    The hallmark of a Tiriac-negotiated endorsement deal for Becker is that it be &quot;long-term,&quot; or more precisely, of at least three years' duration, says Heather MacLachlan of Tiriac's T-V Enterprises. &quot;That's long term for sports.&quot;    Becker's representatives won't reveal his off-court earnings, but other top racqueteers roughly triple their tour winnings with endorsements and exhibitions. He already has won more than $1 million in prize money this year, so his total take could approach $4 million.    Becker has picked up many of the accouterments of an international tennis star. His legal residence is Monte Carlo, a tax haven that could field a heckuva Davis Cup team if it put its foot down. His regular traveling entourage consists of Tiriac, Ms. MacLachlan and coach Gunter Bosch. On the road, he usually eschews the players' hotel for quieter digs, the better to avoid the pushy public. While he's on good terms with the other players, tour officials say he doesn't &quot;hang out&quot; with any of them save Slobodan &quot;Bobo&quot; Zivojinovic, another Tiriac client.    Boris isn't a recluse, however. During his present trip to New York, for example, he has dined out almost nightly on everything from hamburgers to haute cuisine, and on Sunday night he caught the Peter Gabriel rock concert at the Garden. &quot;I like talking, eating, fooling around, having a nice time, even giving autographs,&quot; he says. &quot;I only don't like it when they -- how do you say it? -- gang up on me.&quot;    Alas, that's usually what happens when he goes home to Germany, so he doesn't go there much. He has spent just two weeks in his hometown of Leimen during the past year. &quot;Even people I know all my life talk to me as the Wimbledon champ, not as just Boris. That is sad,&quot; he says. Now, when he wants to visit with his parents, they come to see him.    But he has little time to brood over such matters because when he's not playing he pounds away in practice for three hours a day or more. He reports he has improved his second serve, which never was a pushover, and his volleying. &quot;I'm hitting sharper-angled volleys now, and I'm positioning myself better at the net,&quot; he says. Translated, that means that Boris probably will bounce less in future matches.    One thing that won't change about Becker is his all-out attack upon the ball that makes him tennis's hardest hitter now and, perhaps, ever. &quot;Even when I was a little kid I always hit the ball very hard. That is why I liked the game,&quot; he smiles. &quot;My coaches would tell me to slow down, but I didn't pay attention. I kept hitting hard until the ball obeyed and started going in.&quot;    Another is the desire for victory that burns through his every competition. That's always been a Becker trait, too. As a youngster, he once collapsed vomiting after trying to beat an older rival in a tennis-camp hill-climbing race.    &quot;I hate worst to lose,&quot; he says bluntly. And with the pitiless logic of youth, he doesn't think he'll have to suffer that indignity much longer. &quot;The first time I won at Wimbledon, some people said it was an accident, and maybe they were right. Everything went like it was meant for me to win,&quot; he goes on. &quot;This year, nobody said that.    &quot;I am 19 years old and getting better every day. Lendl is 26 and at the peak of his game. If I don't pass him this week, it will be next week. Or the week after.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
