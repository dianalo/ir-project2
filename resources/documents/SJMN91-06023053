We just want to be recognized.&quot;;   Most of those who urged the council to deny the request argued that City Hallwas not the appropriate site to raise the South Vietnamese flag -- three redhorizontal stripes on a field of yellow.;    Don Potter, a Milpitas residentand veteran who said he owed his life to a Vietnamese man, said, &quot;I would beproud to see it here at one of their functions. But not at City Hall.&quot;;   Potter added, &quot;Please don't let anybody raise a flag in front of City Hallother than the flags that are supposed to be there.&quot;;    The city's policy onceremonial flag-raisings called for the Milpitas city flag to be lowered.;   Ed Cabral, another veteran who opposed the request, said, &quot;If you're going todo that for every ethnic variety, the Milpitas flag will never fly again.&quot;;   Cabral punctuated his point by leaving an MIA bracelet on the podium inscribed&quot;Lt. James Herrick Jr. 10-27-69.&quot;;    Before the vote, Cabral told the fivemembers, &quot;Explain to him why you voted to raise this flag, because he's stillmissing in action.&quot;;    He added, 'I don't know how you people can even thinkabout this.&quot;;    But afterward, Cabral said he was satisfied with thecompromise.;    Diem Ngo explained why the ceremony was so important to him:&quot;We wish to maintain our Vietnamese spirit. We were forced to leave everythingbehind. This is the most significant part of our legacy after we losteverything.&quot;;    After hearing from all sides, Councilman Jim Lawson told theaudience about the ideals this country was founded on: &quot;We protect zealouslythose First Amendment privileges.&quot;;    When the compromise passed, the crowderupted into a thunderous ovation.;    Loc Vu of the Indochinese Relocationand Cultural Center told the council, &quot;When you make a flagpole, please make agood one.&quot; He then invited everyone at the meeting to attend the ceremony.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  RICH RAMIREZ, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910123  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  463  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday January 23, 199100023053,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
