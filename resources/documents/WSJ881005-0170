The decision promises to plague BP's share price, which never recovered from the disastrous offering of the government's 31.7% BP stake amid last year's stock-market collapse. It leaves Kuwait facing a #357 million ($605.3 million) loss, at today's market, in reducing its 21.6% holding. The stake in BP -- Britain's biggest company and America's biggest domestic-oil producer through its Standard Oil Co. unit -- is held by the London-based Kuwait Investment Office, or KIO, which manages much of the Mideast oil nation's estimated #50 billion portfolio.    The order by the British government raised fears that Britain is slipping back into the kind of political meddling that was supposed to be out of fashion in Mrs. Thatcher's free-market reign.    The action &quot;has got to make investors more uncertain&quot; about the government's commitment to free markets, said Douglas Ferrans, an investment director of Scottish Amicable Investment Managers, a #6 billion Glasgow-based institutional investor. &quot;I don't think it's right the government should dictate who owns shares.&quot; Tony Constance, a private investor and former chief executive of fund manager Aitken Hume International PLC, said the move is another signal that even in Mrs. Thatcher's Britain, &quot;pragmatic self-interest sometimes overrides free markets.&quot;    A year ago, Kuwait's interest in BP served the United Kingdom government very well. To minimize the stock-market fallout on the BP offering, the government promised to buy back unwanted shares for a specified period. Kuwait saved Britain much of the trouble, along with about #910 million, by accumulating a 21.6% stake the government otherwise might have had to buy back from angry underwriters. Yesterday, the Mideast oil nation said it is &quot;extremely dissatisfied&quot; with the forced sale, according to a statement in London.    Michael Walter, a British lawyer representing the KIO, said the British decision was based on &quot;pure speculation&quot; about the Mideast nation's motives. &quot;They seem to have ignored evidence or reached their beliefs in defiance of the evidence,&quot; he added. He said the KIO hasn't decided whether a challenge is possible, or how it will divest itself of the shares.    Britain said that as BP's biggest shareholder, oil-producing Kuwait &quot;could be expected to exercise its influence in support of its own national interest&quot; in ways &quot;detrimental both to BP and the U.K.'s public interest.&quot; Specifically, Britain cited concerns that Kuwait, a leading Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries member, might try to force BP to pump less North Sea oil to bolster prices, or cut exploration and research into fossil-fuel alternatives.    But Lord Young, minister for trade and industry, defended the intervention as a &quot;reaffirmation&quot; of free-market beliefs. Kuwait, he said, &quot;is a member of OPEC, one of the great cartels of this world. We will not be part of that cartel.&quot;    The British government seems to have been as upset by the bold style of Kuwait's continuing BP purchases as by the substance of its threat.    Says Robert Mabro, director of Oxford's Institute for Energy Studies, who testified to the British antitrust panel: &quot;I really don't believe Kuwait could really exercise any serious influence just through a shareholding. The arguments put forward by the government and BP about how bad this could be for the image of BP in the U.S. and other countries in my judgment are bogus.&quot;    During the winter and spring, Kuwait ignored British &quot;messages of concern&quot; about its growing holdings of 10%, then 17% and just under 20%. Kuwait defended the purchases as a portfolio investment by the KIO, and declined to limit its stake. After the British government said it would investigate the investment, Kuwait offered legally binding assurances not to seek a board seat or to influence BP, and to limit its voting rights to 14.9%.    But Kuwait's assurances weren't enough. Yesterday's move effectively provides BP with roughly the remedy it wanted. BP Chairman Sir Peter Walters welcomed &quot;the ending of uncertainty&quot; about the Kuwait stake. Despite the possibility the KIO could sell to a more hostile investor, divestment &quot;creates much narrower uncertainty&quot; about BP's future, he added. One possibility is that BP could buy back some of the shares itself. Sir Peter said BP wants to cooperate with the KIO or the British government in an &quot;orderly&quot; sale of the 715 million shares the KIO must divest itself of, currently valued at about #1 billion. Britain is urging the Kuwaitis to cut the stake within the next 12 months.    Kuwait's cooperation is less certain. Jeremy Elden, an analyst at London stockbrokers Phillips andamp; Drew, said Kuwait &quot;is unlikely to take this lying down.&quot; On London's stock exchange yesterday, BP shares initially fell 10 pence (17 cents) on news of the forced sale, but rebounded to close at 237 pence, unchanged.    Britain's intervention marks a sharp contrast with only a few years ago, when the government's main criterion for reviewing substantial share acquisitions and mergers was their effect on competition. &quot;The government has come in recently and these markets get more regulated. Nothing is sacred anymore,&quot; said Bernard Leaver, managing director at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in London. </TEXT></DOC>
