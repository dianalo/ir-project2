Victories in the two elections would give the nominallysocialist party control of three provinces accounting for 52%of the country's population. The largest province, Ontario,elected its first NDP government a year ago.</LP><TEXT>   Latest opinion polls show the New Democrats leading inBritish Columbia, where the vote is set for tomorrow, and inSaskatchewan, where voters will go to the polls Monday.British Columbia is currently governed by the conservativeSocial Credit Party and Saskatchewan by the provincial wingof Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's Conservative Party.   NDP victories could jeopardize some major policyinitiatives of Mr. Mulroney's government, political analystssay. New Democrats oppose parts of the federal government'sconstitutional reform proposals. This plan needs the approvalof seven provinces with at least 50% of the country'spopulation, potentially putting the New Democrats in a vetoposition.   NDP election victories &quot;will complicate just abouteverything,&quot; says Michael Walker, executive director ofFraser Institute, a Vancouver research group. &quot;It makes itimpossible for me to see how a constitutional agreement willbe worked out.&quot;   NDP spokesmen have opposed a federal proposal to guaranteeproperty rights in the constitution and to amend the Bank ofCanada Act to focus the bank's mandate on achieving pricestability rather than on a range of economic goals.   The New Democrats have soft-pedaled their socialistprinciples in the current election campaigns. In bothprovinces, the NDP is proposing to balance the provincialgovernment budgets. &quot;They are running like Tories,&quot; saysDalton Camp, a veteran Conservative strategist.   The party's British Columbia leader, Michael Harcourt, aformer Vancouver mayor, is a &quot;consensus leader&quot; rather thanan ideologue, says Edward McWhinney, international lawprofessor at British Columbia's Simon Fraser University.   In Saskatchewan, party leader Roy Romanow has gone togreat lengths to reassure businessmen that an NDP governmentwouldn't be anti-business, says John Courtney, a Universityof Saskatchewan political science professor.   All the same, the business community isn't happy with someelements of the party platforms in British Columbia andSaskatchewan.   The New Democrats in British Columbia intend to impose aminimum tax on profitable corporations and increase taxes onhigh-income earners. The NDP also intends eventually to banlog exports from the province and to strictly uphold aprovincial moratorium on offshore oil drilling.   The New Democrats in Saskatchewan propose to repeallegislation that broadened the province's 7% provincial salestax to make it consistent with the federal government's 7%value-added tax.</TEXT></DOC>
