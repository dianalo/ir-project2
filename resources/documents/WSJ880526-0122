What could send multinationals to preferred is a change in the 1986 federal tax reform act requiring that they allocate interest expenses to foreign subsidiaries, many now with corporate tax rates higher than the new U.S. rate. That could lead to lost tax credits for the parent, analysts say, and multinationals may find it less expensive overall to raise cash through preferred.    Some analysts and preferred market participants speculate that Exxon Corp.'s foray into the preferred market last week was driven by an attempt to recoup lost tax credits.    The company is offering $250 million of preferred stock in a private placement that could grow to $1 billion in size.    Exxon won't comment on why it is selling preferred or how it plans to use the proceeds.    Details of the tax-law change on interest deductions, and its implementation, have not been released by the Treasury, which hopes to release a report on the matter within 30 days.    Generally, preferred stock is a very expensive means of raising money. Preferred dividends are paid to investors with income remaining after taxes have been paid. Interest payments are paid out before taxes, which lowers a corporation's taxable income.    But the tax-law change in question requires multinational companies to allocate some of their interest payments on debt to their foreign subsidiaries, based on the units' use of the parents' borrowings.    U.S. tax law allows multinationals to credit their foreign tax obligations against their U.S. taxes. But because the U.S. corporate tax rate is now lower than in many other countries, analysts and corporate finance officers say that allocating interest payments overseas in effect turns them into lost tax credits.    What makes preferred stock work for companies in this situation is a type that is somewhat like money-market instruments.    The preferred has its dividends set either through a Dutch auction, in which investors bid on a rate, or a remarketing process, in which an agent sets the rate. The dividend periods in some of these preferreds have been designed in line with those of money-market securities.    Most of these preferreds have their dividend rates set in relation to commercial paper rates. For example, a Wells Fargo preferred auction rate-type preferred had a 5.62% dividend rate set earlier this week, a rate that was 77.5% of the Federal Reserve's 60-day Double-A commercial paper index.    On an after-tax basis, the buyer of the preferred would have a dividend with a rate of 5.05%. The buyer of the commercial paper, which yielded about 7.25%, would have an after-tax yield close to 4.78%.    Because only 30% of stock dividends held by corporations are taxed, the dividend rates on these instruments are lower than commercial paper rates and often are close to the after-tax yield of commercial paper. This tax advantage for the buyers is known as the dividends-received deduction.    Some preferred stock market participants wonder, though, what impact such financings will have on the future of the market.    Congress last year raised the tax on dividend income for corporate holders of stocks to 30% from 20%, in effect trimming the dividends-received deduction.    In legislation proposed last year, &quot;Congress came close enough to eliminating the dividends-received deduction for preferreds,&quot; one dealer says. &quot;You have to wonder whether this won't get them on that bandwagon again.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
