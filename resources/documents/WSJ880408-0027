The five-year-old document, part of court filings made in federal court in Cleveland by Mr. Presser's defense attorneys, appears to undercut the very heart of prosecution assertions that high-level FBI officials never knew about or authorized certain illegal activities by the union chief.    The memo, sent to then-FBI Director William Webster by Oliver Revell, one of his top aides, lays out in great detail procedures to be used by FBI headquarters in authorizing Mr. Presser's &quot;participation in illegal activities.&quot; Mr. Presser was acting as a government informant on organized crime activities.    Although the memo says that Mr. Presser &quot;is not and may not consider himself to be an employee or undercover agent of the FBI,&quot; the document discloses that, as early as May 1983, the FBI's top echelon was wrestling with the problem of &quot;handling&quot; Mr. Presser and keeping track of any illegal activities stemming from his work on behalf on the government.    In the past, Justice Department prosecutors have flatly maintained that senior FBI officials never approved illegal activities by Mr. Presser and that lower-level FBI agents who were aware of such activities failed to inform their superiors or adequately control the union chief.    Moreover, the filing notes that, while the memo was written in 1983, the government has claimed that the issue of authorization by any FBI official first arose in 1985. The FBI memo, according to the filing, contradicts the prosecution's central theory with &quot;pre-existing facts within the government's own possession.&quot;    The linchpin of Mr. Presser's defense is that, indeed, because of his role as an FBI informant, he was given the bureau's approval for those activities for which he now faces prosecution.    Yesterday, a Justice Department spokesman said prosecutors aren't considering dropping or trying to settle the case against Mr. Presser in the wake of the latest disclosures. The FBI declined to comment, and Mr. Webster, who is now head of the Central Intelligence Agency, couldn't be reached. A notation attached to the memo indicates that Mr. Webster didn't sign it, suggesting that he might not have approved its recommendations.    The FBI memo was obtained through the discovery process in the case. The government's case also was damaged by a federal appeals court ruling last month that prosecutors improperly obtained statements from Robert S. Friedrick, a former FBI agent who is under prosecution in a companion case.    In 1986, Mr. Presser was indicted on charges of racketeering, embezzlement and filing false union reports as part of a payroll-padding scheme involving Teamsters Local 507 in Cleveland. The government alleged that between 1972 and 1981, Mr. Presser authorized payments totaling more than $700,000 to three &quot;ghost employees&quot; -- people who received salaries but did no work.    At the same time, Mr. Friedrick, then supervisor of the FBI's organized crime squad in Cleveland, was indicted on charges of lying about his dealings with Mr. Presser and trying to cover up several meetings allegedly aimed at trying to shield Mr. Presser from being indicted.    Although the memo was written two years after the end of the activities for which Mr. Presser was indicted, the filing by his attorneys asserts that the memo shows Mr. Webster knew about previous authorization of illegal activities at the field level.    Prosecutors, however, are likely to emphasize parts of the memo saying that Mr. Presser &quot;shall not initiate a plan to commit criminal acts,&quot; and that &quot;the FBI shall not direct his legitimate labor union activities,&quot; which they could argue would include hiring of personnel for Local 507.    The long and tortuous case against Mr. Presser, which began with an aborted Labor Department investigation and has been hampered by bureaucratic feuding, appeared dead a number of times. The case was quietly dropped in August 1985 amid speculation that the government didn't want to bring a case against an FBI informant. But Senate hearings on the Justice Department's handling of the case brought it back to life in 1986, after Senate investigators indicated that claims that Mr. Presser was authorized to commit illegal acts &quot;weren't corroborated by any entries in FBI files.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
