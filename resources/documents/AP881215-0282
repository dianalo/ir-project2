Gold and silver prices fell in busy trading, pulled down by asell-off in platinum sparked by Ford Motor Co.'s announcement thatit had developed a catalytic converter that didn't use the metal.   Dealers said speculation that the U.S. Federal Reserve wouldfollow the West German Bundesbank's move by boosting the U.S.discount rate helped the dollar.   Dealers widely had discounted the Bundesbank's move to raise itskey Lombard lending rate by 0.5 percentage point to 5.5 percent. Butmany market players had held on to marks rather than dollars inhopes that the move would boost the mark further against the U.S.currency.   When such a rise did not materialize, dealers sold their marksfor dollars and other currencies.   ``The move was predicted, and there wasn't enough reaction toit,'' one dealer said.   The Lombard rate is the interest the West German central bankcharges commercial banks for supplemental borrowings in whichsecurities are used as collateral. The discount rate is what theFederal Reserve charges on loans to commercial banks.   The West German rate hike followed rate hikes on Wednesday andThursday by the central banks of France, Belgium and the Netherlandsand Austria.   In London, the British pound dipped to $1.8280 from $1.8335 onWednesday.   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday'srates, included: 1.7485 West German marks, up from 1.7365; 1.4725Swiss francs, up from 1.4630; 5.9745 French francs, up from 5.9350;1.9665 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9590; 1,288.00 Italian lire, upfrom 1,279.50; and 1.2054 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1986.   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,the dollar fell 0.38 yen to a closing 122.97 yen. Later in London,the dollar was quoted at 123.35 yen.   A wave of platinum selling was sparked by reports that Ford MotorCo. Chairman Donald Petersen said his company had developed acatalyst that was just as effective as platinum in meeting stringentexhaust emissions standards, but was significantly less expensive.   Platinum tumbled to $565 an ounce at the close in Zurich, downfrom Wednesday's close of $600 an ounce and the session high of $601.   Gold fell in London to a late bid of $416.45 a troy ounce,compared with $420.75 bid late Wednesday In Zurich, gold closed at$416.00 an ounce, down from $420 bid late Wednesday.
