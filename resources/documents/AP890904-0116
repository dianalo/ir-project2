AGUILAR</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The United States placed Panamanianofficials on a blacklist Monday, forbidding U.S. companies andgovernment agencies from buying from them or their businesses.   U.S. Embassy officials said the action was intended to ``hurt thepocketbooks'' of people associated with Panamanian strongman Gen.Manuel Antonio Noriega.   The measure affects Panamanian officials who own companies thatsell millions of dollars to the U.S. Southern Command militaryinstallations or to the Panama Canal Commission, a U.S. governmentagency that administers the Panama Canal.   The list released by the U.S. Embassy contains more than 150names, including all members of the Cabinet and the 14 members ofthe Defense Forces' Strategic Command, the officials said.   U.S. government agencies in Panama spend almost $900 million ongoods and services in Panama.   Embassy officials said they plan to release a list of companiesowned by Noriega or people near to him within days.   The U.S. government does not recognize the provisional president,Francisco Rodriguez, who took office Friday. The United Statesconsiders Rodriguez a puppet of Noriega, the Defense Forces leaderwho has been indicted by two federal grand juries in Florida on drugtrafficking charges.   Rodriguez filled the vacuum created when the Panamaniangovernment annulled the May 7 elections, which internationalobservers say the opposition was winning by a 3-to-1 margin.   Rodriguez, who swore in his Cabinet on Monday, said he wouldgovern with an appointed legislative commission. Six of the 11Cabinet members were re-appointed.   Opposition leaders, who refused to participate in the newgovernment, last weekend turned down an offer to participate in the41-member legislative commission.   ``Our fight is for the democratization of our country and not forbureaucratic spoils or for political spaces,'' said Ricardo AriasCalderon, a vice presidential candidate in the May elections.   The list released Monday includes Fortunato Magravita, owner of ameat market that counts the Southern Command among its principalcustomers. Magravita is a director of the National Bank of Panama.   The U.S. Army also is the biggest customer of the company FirmasEfficientes, a computer paper and forms distributor owned by AngelModesto Jaen, an official of the National Sports Institute and oneof those on the list.   ``U.S. companies cannot sell to these people or their companiesor extend any credit,'' said embassy spokesman Terry Kneebone.   Still in effect are U.S. government sanctions imposed on Panamamore than a year ago that withhold payment of canal fees and taxeson Panama Canal Commission salaries. The sanctions also freezePanamanian government funds in the United States and forbid U.S.companies from dealing with Panamanian government agencies.   U.S. officials and opposition leaders acknowledge that thesanctions had not achieved the desired effect: Noriega's ouster.   Sources indicated that U.S. companies and others were violatingthe sanctions through intermediaries.   ``This time the Treasury Department will be more vigorous in theapplication of the sanctions,'' a U.S. source said on condition ofanonymity.   Many of those on the list were reported to have bank accounts andproperties in the United States and U.S. officials said the TreasuryDepartment ``was not discounting'' further action regarding thoseassets.   The U.S. government's displeasure with those associated withNoriega will also mean revoking the U.S. citizenship of PanamanianFinance Minister Orville K. Goodin, the sources said. Goodin, whoalso holds Panamanian citizenship, held the same post in theprevious Cabinet.   Officials confirmed the United States acted to remove Goodin'scitizenship on the grounds he is an official of a foreign government.</TEXT></DOC>
