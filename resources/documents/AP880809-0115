(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Montana's Fish and Game Commission hasadopted emergency fishing regulations to help preserve troutendangered by dwindling water in many drought-ravaged streams andrivers.   The commission's action is a ``good start,'' said Stan Bradshaw,spokesman for the Montana chapter of Trout Unlimited. ``It's arecognition, at least, that times are tough.''   In a related action, the commission agreed with a Department ofFish, Wildlife and Parks proposal to make more antelope, deer andelk permits available this year in many hunting districts.   A low harvest last year, combined with drought-withered forageavailable for this winter, convinced the commissioners that huntersshould be given a chance to harvest game before the animals starve.   The fishing restrictions, which take effect Friday and will lastat least through February, apply to most trout streams east of theRocky Mountains and a few in western Montana, the commission saidMonday.   Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks personnel said this isthe first time the commission has been forced to take emergencysteps to deal with a drought's impacts on fisheries.   Most seriously affected by the changes will be the centralfishing district, where limits will be reduced from five trout totwo trout on most waterways.   ``Most of the rivers and streams in the district are at or nearrecord low flows for this time of year,'' Pat Graham, chief of theDepartment of Fish, Wildlife and Parks' Fisheries Division, toldthe commission. ``The situation is bad and getting worse, and wehave to do what we can to protect the state's wild trout fishery.   ``At this point, rain is not going to solve the problem. If moretrout begin to die as a result of the low stream flows and highwater temperatures, the detrimental impacts on the fisheries willbe apparent for several years.''   Graham noted that his agency does not stock streams withhatchery fish, so ``the imposition of emergency restrictions is theonly way we can offer protection to the wild trout in these streamsthat will spawn in the fall and spring.''   ``We depend on wild rainbow and brown trout to maintain our fishpopulations,'' Graham said.   If water levels continue to decline, fishing bans in keyspawning areas may be requested at the commission's Septembermeeting, he warned.</TEXT></DOC>
