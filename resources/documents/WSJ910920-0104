Next year, California will elect one out of eightHouse Members, the largest state delegation in history. Butwho those Members are may have already been determined thisweek when state legislators went behind closed doors and usedcomputer versions of Etch-a-Sketch to gerrymander the state.   In 1981, the late Rep. Phil Burton carved up California ina bizarre gerrymander that he called his &quot;contribution toabstract art.&quot; The issue now is whether Phil Burton'smasterpiece will be perpetuated.</LP><TEXT>   Redistricting tends to bring out the worst in politicians,who assume that the public isn't going to ask questions aboutthe process. In California, there are four main sets ofplayers.   Liberal Democrats, led by Rep. Howard Berman, want topreserve the gains the party made under the Burtonmander.Conservative Republicans, led by Rep. John Doolittle, wantmost of the state's seven new House seats to go to thefast-growing, conservative suburbs. GOP Governor Pete Wilson,under fire from conservatives for raising taxes, wants tobolster his position in the party by drawing seats for hismoderate allies. Finally, black and Hispanic groups want todraw bizarre districts to elect the maximum number of theirown legislators.   Electing Pete Wilson was a top priority for Californiaconservatives last year, largely because he would have vetopower over any redistricting plan passed by the DemocraticLegislature. The irony now is that the real battle overredistricting is between Governor Wilson and moderateRepublicans. Rep. Doolittle entered into negotiations withDemocrats in the Legislature to draw a plan that wouldprotect almost all incumbents and draw new seats for severalconservative GOP state legislators. Governor Wilson, alreadyat war with the GOP's right wing, promptly promised to vetoany version of the Doolittle plan even though it somewhatfavors the GOP. The likely result would be to have the courtsdraw the new political maps.   Yesterday, the Legislature passed three separate sets ofredistricting plans and sent them to the Governor. Onecontinues the 1981 Burtonmander but with more black andHispanic seats. Another is a strange-bedfellows compromiseplan drawn up by Reps. Doolittle and Berman. The third is aplan that protects incumbents but delivers most of thestate's new seats to Mr. Wilson's moderate allies in theLegislature. Democratic legislators hope either to temptGovernor Wilson into signing the third plan or to convinceenough conservative legislators to override the Governor'sveto of the compromise plan.   The public will have almost no say in any of this. All ofthe plans are gerrymanders, routinely splitting counties,cities and communities of interest. The drawing of districtsis an inherently political act. That's why it is such aconflict of interest to allow incumbent legislators tocontrol the drawing pens. California voters probably would bebetter off if Governor Wilson vetoes every plan sent to himand sends the issue to the courts.   In the future, voters should insist on the adoption offormulas requiring that districts be compact andcomprehensible. Unless districts are fairly drawn toencourage political competition, many predetermined electionswill be essentially meaningless. When voters realize this,many will simply stop voting.</TEXT></DOC>
