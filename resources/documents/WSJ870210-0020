Christian HillStaff Reporter of The  Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 02/10/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> AMAB GOVMTEARNINGS (ERN)BANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK) </IN><TEXT>   Alaska Mutual Bancorp. announced a $31.2 million fourth-quarter loss, and disclosed that its main bank unit is seeking financial assistance from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.    The Anchorage-based company's wholly owned Alaska Mutual Bank, the state's second-largest bank, has been battered by real-estate losses related to Alaska's severe energy slump. The fourth-quarter loss reduced the holding company's shareholder equity to $14.5 million, or 1.7% of its $845 million of assets. Federal regulators generally ask for banks to maintain an equity ratio of at least 4% to 5%.    Last Friday, Alaska Mutual indicated that it would post a loss, and also disclosed that its bank unit agreed to a sweeping cease-and-desist order by the FDIC, alleging unsafe and unsound banking practices.    Barry L. Hulin, the bank's president, said it is seeking so-called open-bank assistance from the FDIC, under which the agency infuses capital but refrains from declaring the institution insolvent.    The FDIC provides such assistance when it determines the method is cheaper than closing a failed bank. Last year, it provided $130 million of assistance to BancOklahoma Corp. The FDIC's biggest ever open-bank assistance case was in 1984 and involved Continental Illinois Corp. The FDIC declines to comment on applications for such assistance.    &quot;In our view, assistance is appropriate and necessary given the depth of the economic problems in the state and the need to maintain public confidence in the banking industry's ability to lead Alaska's economic recovery,&quot; Mr. Hulin said, adding: &quot;Forced liquidation in this marketplace, at this time, would benefit no one.&quot;    Alaska Mutual's fourth-quarter loss resulted mainly from a $30.7 million addition to the bank's loan-loss reserve. The company earned $1.9 million, or 60 cents a share, in the year-ago fourth quarter. For all of 1986, Alaska Mutual incurred a loss of $41.2 million, compared with 1985 earnings of $8.6 million, or $2.72 a share.    Mr. Hulin predicted that the Alaskan economy will continue to deteriorate during 1987, and that the bank's non-performing loans will &quot;increase accordingly.&quot; He said the addition to the loan-loss reserve reflected an effort to write down real-estate collateral to current values, &quot;although no active market exists for real estate&quot; in Alaska.    But the FDIC's cease-and-desist order also alleged that the bank violated state and federal law by, among other things, engaging in &quot;hazardous lending and lax collection&quot; policies and maintaining insufficient capital and loan-loss reserves. The order requires Alaska Mutual to raise as much as $10 million of primary capital.    The company said Friday that it hired L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin Inc., an investment bank, to explore &quot;all avenues to bolster our capital.&quot;    Yesterday, Mr. Hulin said the effort to find private help will continue, &quot;including combining with other banks.&quot;    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Alaska Mutual common closed at $2.0625, up 18.75 cents.    Other Alaskan banks are also being hurt by the slump. First Interstate Corp. of Alaska last week reported a 1986 net loss of $15.8 million, compared with 1985 earnings of $4.1 million, or $1.57 a share.    However, Alaska's largest bank company, National Bancorp of Alaska, last month reported fourth-quarter net income of $4.7 million, or 94 cents a share, down 9% from $5.1 million, or $1.03 a share, the year earlier. Full-year earnings totaled $18 million, or $3.62 a share, down 7% from $19.5 million, or $3.90 a share, in 1985. </TEXT></DOC>
