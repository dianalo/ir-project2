RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court today barred asbestosmanufacturers from suing the government to recover money they paidto a Navy shipyard worker injured by inhaling the product.   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by twomanufacturers in a case from Washington state.   Albert Lopez worked as a pipe fitter, pipe coverer and insulatorat the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Washington from 1947 to 1984.   Eagle-Picher Industries Inc. settled a claim against it by payingLopez $10,000. Raymark Industries Inc. did the same for $7,200.   Both manufacturers supplied asbestos to the Navy to insulateships.   Lopez's claims were used in the lower courts as a test case ofthe government's liability for injuries suffered by shipyard workers.   A federal appeals court here ruled last September that themanufacturers lack any legal basis to recover from the governmentthe money they pay to settle asbestos-related claims against them.   The appeals court rejected arguments that the government, byordering asbestos, in effect insured the manufacturers againstlawsuits by injured workers.   The appeals court said the manufacturers seem to be suggestingthat the government ``knew more about the hazards of asbestos thanit ever disclosed to its suppliers.''   The manufacturers appear to be arguing that if they knew of thedangers ``they would have gone out of the asbestos business at onceand saved themselves untold liability or else would have purchasedall the insurance available and passed the cost on ... in sharplyhigher prices,'' the appeals court said.   ``We may have to suppress our wonderment that anyone would haveknown more about the hazards of asbestos than those responsiblecompanies who used it as raw material,'' the court continued.   But, it added, even if the government knew more about the dangersof asbestos than the manufacturers, there still is no legal basisfor the companies to recover the money.   The Bush administration urged the justices to reject thecompanies' appeal.   Justice Department lawyers noted that the high court ruled lastyear that defense contractors are immune from personal-injurylawsuits when they follow government specifications and warn thegovernment of any dangers of which they are aware.   But that ruling does not shield manufacturers of products foundto cause injury independent of government specifications for theiruse, the government lawyers said.   The cases are Eagle-Picher vs. U.S., 88-1382, and Raymark vs.U.S., 88-1418.</TEXT></DOC>
