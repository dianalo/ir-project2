GRACZYK</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Death row inmate James Smith, bitterover a reprieve from his scheduled execution, acknowledged killinga Houston insurance office manager and said those trying to savehim were ``bleeding-heart jerks.''   Smith, whose lethal injection was halted about six hours beforeit would have been carried out, blamed death penalty opponents forpersuading his mother in Indiana to pursue a request to the U.S.Supreme Court for a reprieve.   ``This woman doesn't know me,'' Smith said of his mother,Alexzene Hamilton of Indianapolis. ``She may understand some childwho was under her care, but she doesn't understand this matureadult male.''   Smith said he did not want the stay because he does not want towaste away on death row.   ``This was a decision I had made. It was the last act of freedomI could make,'' he said. ``It's frightening, to tell you thetruth.''   Smith, 37, was sentenced to die for the 1983 robbery-slaying ofLarry Rohus, manager of a Houston insurance office. He previouslyinsisted he was innocent, but in an interview Wednesday detailedthat murder and what he said were at least six other slayings,including the mutilation deaths of three people in South Carolinaand one of a baby in New York City.   But authorities in both areas said there was no evidence suchkillings had occurred.   He also told of a murder in Miami in 1978 and a second besidesthe baby in New York City in 1979. He said the baby was purchasedin Spanish Harlem for $300, used in voodoo rituals and left on ahighway leading to the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge where it likelywould be run over.   ``Look what you're trying to save!'' he said, describing deathpenalty opponents who want to keep him alive as ``just a bunch ofbleeding-heart jerks.''   ``I'm still going to be executed,'' he insisted. ``It may take alittle longer.''   Smith said Rohus was shot to death because of snide remarks theinsurance office manager made while Smith was robbing the place.   ``I killed him the same as I would a fly in my soup bowl,'' hesaid. ``I shot him through the heart _ almost at point-blank range_ to get money. And then I ran out.''   Harris County Assistant District Attorney Roberto Gutierrez, whoprosecuted Smith, has described the former New Orleans tarot-cardreader as the most evil and dangerous man he's ever prosecuted.   ``That guy's got a little bit of insight,'' Smith responded,when told of Gutierrez's comment.   Smith said his involvement in voodoo began in high school. TheSouth Carolina ritual slayings occurred in Orangeburg County thespring of 1981, he said.   Records there show five murders in 1981, four shooting victimsand one in a fire. County Sheriff C.R. Smith Jr. said Wednesday hecould recall no such incidents like those described by Smith in1981, in the few years before that or since.   If Smith committed such crimes in Orangeburg County, the bodieswere never found there, the sheriff said.   In New York City, police spokeman Sgt. Peter Sweeney said he wasunaware of any homicide involving a mutilated infant whose body wasleft on the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge.   Mrs. Hamilton's appeal questioned her son's mental competence.He said the competency issue was linked to a 1978 Miami armedrobbery charge, to which he pleaded innocent due to temporaryinsanity.   ``The insanity issue is brought forth by lawyers to get peopleoff,'' Smith said. ``That's what my lawyer recognized.''</TEXT></DOC>
