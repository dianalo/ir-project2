Wilke   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>07/09/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE B3</SO><CO>   DEC</CO><IN>COMPUTERS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (CPR)</IN><LP>   Taking aim at International Business Machines Corp.,Digital Equipment Corp. is expected today to unveil a newgeneration of its strong-selling MicroVAX computer line,which analysts say has brought in more than $7 billion insales since its debut in 1986.   The new line underscores Digital's strategic commitment toproprietary-design minicomputers, despite increasingcompetitive pressure from smaller machines running standardsoftware. Like IBM, Digital has an enormous base of customerswho have made long-term investments in its design.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The minicomputer business is actually alive and doingreasonably well for Digital and IBM,&quot; though for othercompanies it has probably died, says Jay P. Stevens, ananalyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.   The MicroVAX -- at the low end of Digital's flagship line-- has been a solid performer in a difficult year, growingabout 10% to $2 billion in annual sales, Mr. Stevens says.But it hasn't been enough to offset the collapse of high-endrevenue in the fiscal year ended June 30, as sales ofDigital's 8000-series machines dwindled to almost nothing andcustomers awaited the mainframe-class VAX 9000.   Despite its reliance on the VAX, Digital in the past yearhas stepped up marketing of a new computer design that runson standard software, and has built products to bridgestandard and proprietary designs of its own and those of IBM,Apple Computer Inc. and others.   In a further reflection of the changing market, Digitalhas redesigned its newest VAX for client-server computing, inwhich one or more computers act as servers or hubs fornetworks of smaller desktop machines. In a departure fromtraditional design, the new VAX has several processors nearlyas powerful as the central processor that are dedicated tospeeding up data traffic on the network and allowingespecially fast access to disk-storage devices.   The new line, to be called the VAX 4000, delivers morepower than IBM's top-of-the-line AS/400 minicomputer, at lessthan half the cost, Digital Vice President Bill Demmer saidFriday.   &quot;The real competition is IBM, and always has been,&quot; Mr.Demmer said. He said several smaller competitors such asCompaq Computer Corp. and Sun Microsystems Inc. present&quot;short-term tactical situations&quot; but that IBM remainsDigital's key strategic focus.   Dean Witter's Mr. Stevens called the new line aggressivelypriced and said it appears somewhat faster than expected. Themodels will range in price from $60,910 to $329,000,depending on configuration.   The VAX 4000 makes its debut at a scaled-back DECWorldsales exposition in Boston, the first in two years. At theshow, Digital also is expected to introduce newnetwork-management software, computer servers dedicated totasks such as database access or intensive scientificcomputing, and products that tie computer networks togetherand connect them to high-speed optical data links.</TEXT></DOC>
