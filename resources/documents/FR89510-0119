After consultationsunder the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) on February 25,1982, the United States requested a GATT dispute settlement panel on March31, 1982. On August 17, 1982, the President directed USTR to expedite disputesettlement (47 FR 36403).After several GATT panel meetings and report revisions, a final panel reportfavorable to the United States was issued on July 20, 1984. The panel foundthat the production aids granted to processors of canned fruit nullifiedand imparied tariff concessions granted by the EC on those products, andthe panel suggested that the EC restore the competitive relationship betweenimported U.S. and domestic EC canned fruit. The United States requestedadoption of the panel report in GATT Council meetings of April 30, May29, June 4 and July 16, 1985, but Council action was deferred because theEC was not prepared to accept adoption of the report.On September 7, 1985, the President directed USTR to recommend section301 retaliation unless this case was resolved by December 1, 1985. On November30, 1985, the U.S. and the EC reached a settlement under which, in additionto subsidy reductions already implemented on canned pears, the EC agreedto eliminate the canning element of its processing subsidies for cannedpeaches. USTR closely monitored implementation of this agreement from 1986-1988.In August 1988, the United States informed the EC Commission that new subsidylevels implemented in July 1988 exceeded allowable levels under the agreement.Since October 1988 USTR has been consulting with the EC regarding boththe new subsidy levels and the methodology for calculation of its subsidies,but the EC continues to subsidize at levels which are inconsistent withthe agreement.<ITAG tagnum="84">Investigation</ITAG>Pursuant to section 302(b)(1)(A) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended,the USTR has determined that an investigation under section 302 shouldbe initiated with respect to the EC policy and practice in this manner,in order to determine whether it is actionable under section 301.<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Hearing</ITAG>A public hearing regarding this matter will be held at 2:00 PM on June9, 1989 in Courtroom A, Room 100, at the International Trade Commission,500 E Street, SW, Washington, DC 20436.Interested persons wishing to testify orally must provide a written requestto do so by noon on May 30, 1989, to Ms. Dorothy Balaban, Staff Assistantto the Section 301 Committee, Office of the U.S. Trade Representative,Room 222, 600 17th Street, NW., Washington, DC 20506. In addition, theymust provide the following information: (1) Name, address, telephone number,and firm or affiliation; and (2) a summary of their presentation. Afterconsideration of a request to present oral testimony at the public hearing,the Chairman of the Section 301 Committee will notify the applicant ofthe time of his or her testimony, if the request conforms to the requirementsof 15 CFR 2006.8(a). Remarks at the hearing will be limited to 5 minutes.In addition, persons presenting oral testimony must submit 20 copies oftheir complete written testimony, in English, by noon on June 1, 1989,to Ms. Balaban at the address listed above. All written submissions mustbe filed in accordance with 15 CFR part 2006.8.The public is invited to comment on: (1) Whether the EC policy and practiceat issue is actionable under section 301, including comments on whetherit violates a trade agreement; and if so, (2) the appropriateness of subjectingthe products listed in Annex A to an increase in duties or to other traderestrictions in response to the EC practice; and (3) the amount of theburden or restriction on U.S. commerce caused by the EC practice; (4) levelsat which U.S. customs duties or other import restrictions on particularproducts should be set; and (5) the degree to which increased duties orother import restrictions might have an adverse effect on U.S. consumersof the products concerned. The comments submitted will be considered indetermining actionability under section 301 and in recommending any actionunder section 301 to the USTR.In order to assure each party an opportunity to contest the informationprovided by other parties, the Section 301 Committee will entertain rebuttalbriefs filed by any party, in accordance with 15 CFR 2006.8(c), by noonon June 16, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="6">A.

Trey LeBlanc, III.</ITAG><T3>Introduction and summary. </T3>In this Order, we dispose of the issuesraised by the Postal Service's motion to dismiss the complaint filed byThird Class Mail Association (TCMA).\1\<NOTE/> While we are granting that motion, we do not do so on thegrounds suggested (essentially, lack of subject matter jurisdiction) butbecause consideration of the issues raised and the procedural suggestionmade by the complainant's February 15, 1989,\2\<NOTE/> pleading indicate that the complaint procedure would be anunproductive one, ill-suited to the types of issues raised. Accordingly,we have determined on using a much less formal method to shed some lighton the significant issues of underlying theory to which TCMA points.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The Service filed its Motion to Dismiss on November 16,1988, together with an Answer. The Office of the Consumer Advocate (OCA)supported the motion (Answer, November 23, 1988), as did the American PostalWorkers Union (APWU) and National Association of Letter Carriers (NALC)(Joint Answer, December 5, 1988) and National Newspaper Association (Response,December 5, 1988). TCMA and United Parcel Service (UPS) each filed responsesopposing the motion (December 5, 1988). On December 8, 1988, the Serviceresponded to TCMA's opposition, eliciting a further Statement (December9, 1988) from TCMA. On February 28, 1989, the Staff of the Bureau of Economics,Federal Trade Commission, filed comments generally supporting TCMA, andon April 12, 1989, Direct Marketing Association, Inc. (DMA) also filedcomments supporting TCMA.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ This pleading responded to Order No. 812 (December 21,1988), which directed TCMA (and any other interested participant) to statewhat witnesses might be called and the general subject matters of theirtestimony, together with an explanation of ``how the evidence it intendsto present will support the final determination it requests from this Commission.''Order No. 812, at 2.<T3>Jurisdictional arguments. </T3>The Postal Service generally assertsthat we lack jurisdiction to consider the propriety of applying the statutory(39 U.S.C. 601) letter monopoly to addressed third-class advertisements.The motion practice on this issue has largely concerned our Order No. 133(August 6, 1976, in Docket No. RM76-4); it has been questioned whetherthe ``ancillary jurisdiction'' principle announced in Order 133 appliesto this case at all, as well as whether the case meets its standards. We think a practical resolution of the present problem does not requireus to delve into those matters. TCMA has made it clear that its first objectis a relatively informal \3\<NOTE/> phase designed to illuminate the present state of economictheory concerning the justification for the monopoly. TCMA, indeed, believesthat the mainstream of theory today is materially different from what itwas approximately 15 years ago, when the Board of Governors issued itsstatutorily-mandated report on the Private Express Statutes.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Specifically, TCMA suggests use of notice and commentprocedures. TCMA Response to Order 812, at 1, 6-7, 9-10.<T3>Centrality of the theory question.</T3> In its February pleading, TCMAleaves no doubt that obtaining a clear picture of the relevant economictheory is of the first importance; its further proposal for an evidentiary``Phase II'' depends on the outcome of that inquiry:<ITAG tagnum="21">* * * the conduct of Phase II of this proceeding before the completionof Phase I is pointless because it proceeds on a very different conceptualmodel of the role of competition in the modern postal system than now exists.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Response to Order 812, at 10. We are inclined to agree with this much, at least, of TCMA's position.It is true that the period since postal Reorganization has seen major additionsto the theory used in eccnomic analysis of the multiproduct firm. New costand pricing concepts have been developed that can provide theoretical insightsinto both justifications for, and challenges to, a statutory monopoly.Much of this theoretical work appears to have focused on the problem ofa regulated monopoly facing competition in some markets. <T3>Appropriate procedural arrangements.</T3> Our agreement that it wouldbe useful to assemble a variety of views on the theoretical questions raisedby TCMA does not, on the other hand, entail treating the matter simplyas a section 3662 complaint. First, the invocation of a statutory procedureimplying at least the opportunity for formal hearings is unnecessary wherethe end result is a comprehensive view of the state of economic theory,as of 1989, on a question that arguably has not been examined in depthsince the early '70s. These question do not lend themselves to the makingof findings by the Commission \4\<NOTE/> that one school of thought is ``right'' and another ``wrong.''Whether a clear direction emerges from the theoretical contributions, whetherit is squarely or only marginally relevant to the postal situation, andhow far policy choices are to be guided by economic theory should otherconsiderations point in a different direction, are not, or not solely,Commission questions. It is nonetheless true that all those with an interestor a policymaking role as regards the monopoly should have a clearer picturethan we believe now exists of the theory relevant to it.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ Whose expertise in pure theory is, in any case, relativelylimited compared with that of some potential authors of comments and othermaterial likely to be submitted to it. Accordingly, we have determined to dismiss the complaint, not because itis beyond our jurisdiction as interpreted in Order 133 (a point on whichwe express no view) but because it is a fundamentally unproductive wayin which to attack the question. We will, therefore, schedule a period for the submission of written commentson: 1. The fundamental question of the present state of economic theory regardingthe possible justifications for monopoly \5\<NOTE/>, with particular reference to developments that have occurredin the last 15 to 20 years; as well as <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ Here we contemplate comments pro and con on the justificationof monopoly both for efficiency reasons and for equity reasons. 2. The applicability of the theory, in light of such newer developments,to the letter monopoly in general, and, in particular, to its applicationto third-class addressed advertisements.    These comments may be in whatever written format the submitter considersmost useful, and, specifically, may include scholarly papers (either newor previously published) as well as comments of the type more commonlyfound in rulemaking proceedings. Full references to relevant theoreticalliterature are encouraged. Following the submission of comments, and aperiod for interested parties to read and analyze them, a nonadversarial,nonevidentiary (``legislative-type'') hearing will be scheduled, at whichauthors of material submitted are encouraged to appear and, after presentinga brief summary of their views, respond to questions from the Commission.The final written product, we anticipate, will contain all the commentsfiled and the transcript of the hearing proceedings. The Commission willdistribute it to those interested in the question, including the PostalService and its Board of Governors. It Is Ordered: (A) Docket No. C89-1 is terminated. (B) Docket No. RM89-4 is established for the purpose of assembling thepapers and comments, conducting the hearing, and making publicly availablethe materials so assembled, all as described in the body of this Order.(C) The Secretary shall promptly publish this Order in the Federal Register.(D) Papers and written comments in Docket No. RM89-4 will be received atany time through September 1, 1989.  (E) The hearing will be held beginning October 17, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="21">By the Commission. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Charles L.
