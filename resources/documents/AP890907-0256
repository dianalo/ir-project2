Shanghai residents, once famous for their business acumen inChina and beyond, are more concerned about the economy than withpolitical maneuverings to the north in the capital Beijing, cityofficials and citizens say.   So far, Shanghai has been spared nationwide moves to suppressprivate entrepreneurs and capitalist ideas. Some attribute thereprieve to the protection of former Shanghai leader Jiang Zemin,who in June replaced ousted leader Zhao Ziyang as head of China'sCommunist Party.   In contrast with Beijing, guarded by armed soldiers, Shanghaiseems almost apolitical.   The university students who led the pro-democracy demonstrationshere in June face mandatory political education, but Shanghai'sworkers have been spared that fate.   ``A worker's first responsibility is to produce,'' says YangXianghai, deputy chief of the City Planning Commission. ``Ourworkers need to improve the quality of their work, their moralityand discipline, but we're not having political education.''   Shanghai seems to be busy making up for time lost in June as ittries to proceed with an ambitious industrial restructuring programaimed at making the city an international economic center that wouldresurrect its historical preeminence in Asia.   Government figures show the sprawling city's industrial outputhas jumped by more than 77 percent over the past nine years becauseof economic liberalization and joint ventures with foreigners thatrange from medical equipment to aircraft and car assembly.   But Shanghai remains encumbered a burgeoning population of morethan 6 million people that overwhelm the decaying infrastructure ofa city still crammed with crumbling 40-year-old factories.   City planners say one of their main goals is to replace plantsthat produce cheap products like windup watches and plastic toyswith industries that make high-tech goods for sale abroad.   ``We want to increase our exports, which now account for only 15percent of our total production, with high quality bicycles andelectronics goods, sophisticated electrical machinery and basicindustrial inputs,'' Yang says.   ``We've been producing just about everything here, and it's notto our advantage. It's too disorganized,'' he says. ``We're paringaway sectors that aren't much use. There are some industries we justwon't be able to save.''   The city faces severe shortages of raw materials and energy inits efforts to modernize. An official report noted recently thatmany factories were closed for two or three days a week due becauseof insufficient electricity and other scarce resources.   Shanghai's mostly state-controlled industries also have sufferedfrom China's general predicament of skyrocketing costs for rawmaterials while retail prices remain under strict controls.   For decades, China relied on Shanghai's state-run industries tohelp foot the government's bill for the rest of the developingeconomy. The city retained little for its own upkeep.   A new policy allowing Shanghai to use locally all but 17 percentof its tax revenues gave the city an extra 1.4 billion yuan, worthabout $376 million at today's exchange rates, but a nationwideeconomic slowdown and a year-old fiscal austerity program haveresulted in a 3 billion-yuan shortfall in investment funds, ZhuXiaohua, deputy director of the Shanghai branch of the People's Bankof China, reported recently.   In the first six months of this year, the city postponedconstruction of 1,612 projects and slashed its total investment by5.16 billion yuan or about $1.39 billion.   It also stopped or restricted production of 109 products as itset priorities for using scarce resources.   In a bid to scrounge additional cash, the city sent salesmen toChina's remote northwestern provinces of Inner Mongolia andXinjiang, where factories aren't so plentiful, to try to sell anestimated 1 billion yuan worth of excess televisions, refrigerators,washing machines and bicycles, Yang said.   Plans to make Shanghai an international financial center alsohave been stymied by the lack of available cash, foreign executivesand officials say.   Shanghai's fledgling stock exchange, where 1,625 companies haveissued shares, has a total stock value of only 800 million yuan or$215 million.   Yang says the city hopes to go ahead, however, with majorrenovation and modernization projects, including a new harbor, asubway system and new sewage and telephone lines, despite foreignexchange and local currency shortfalls.   Shanghai's government also is building satellite towns around thecity and plans to raze old buildings to make way for spaciousapartment blocks and green parks. Industrial centers andinternational hotels are sprouting amid the city's old red and graybrick mansions.   Shanghai's ability to pull off plans to create a modern city inthe end may depend on the fate of Shanghai's leaders _ urbanebureaucrats like Communist Party Secretary General Jiang andShanghai Mayor Zhu Rongji.   Some analysts attribute the city's continuing relative freedom topursue its economic goals to Jiang's protection. But Jiang isincreasingly being seen as an interim leader whose influence at thetop may be short-lived.</TEXT><NOTE>End adv for Monday Sept. 11.</NOTE></DOC>
