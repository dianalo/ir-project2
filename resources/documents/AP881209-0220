(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Monson Trucking, a highly profitable familybusiness that prides itself on a glistening fleet of modern rigs,has been crippled by the first drivers' strike in its 73-yearhistory.   The walkout will enter its second week Sunday, keeping 125Teamsters in the Midwest jobless and neutralizing Monson's 24-statedistribution network, which revolves around the shipment ofnewsprint from Ontario.   Both sides say the dispute is fueled by years of bad bloodbetween Monson and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.   ``They are considered to be one of the most corrupt organizationsin the United States,'' company President Robert Monson said of theinternational union. ``Why should you want to deal with them?   ``The Teamsters never have been and never will be welcomedhere,'' he added.   Sherman Liimatainen, secretary-treasurer of Teamsters Union Local346, said Monson is the most anti-union employer of the 330companies he has had to deal with as an officer of Local 346.   ``For a company that displays a white-horse image out there, it'sfair to say that horse has spots on it,'' Liimatainen said. `His(Monson's) total approach is, `You guys are people I'm going todictate to.'   ``Any time anyone asserted their rights in this union, they (thecompany) had a way of intimidating them,'' he said.   Despite a threat that they would be permanently replaced if theystruck, by midweek only a handful of drivers had crossed the picketline in front of company headquarters along windswept Highway 61 onLake Superior's north shore, union officials said.   The company ordered them to return to work last Monday.   Monson said Wednesday the company intends to hire permanentreplacements until it is `back to full strength.''   Striking driver Bill Miller, a union steward, said he knew ofonly four replacement hirings.   Monson said Monday he was considering options which includedrenewing contract talks with Local 346 of Duluth and Local 160,which covers employees at Monson's Red Wing terminal. On Wednesday,however, he said he didn't see any reason to return to thebargaining table.   Liimatainen said Wednesday no new talks were set. He said threemediated negotiating sessions were held before the company'sthree-year contract proposal was rejected by 99 percent of votingunion members. The previous two-year contract expired Nov. 26.   Miller and fellow union steward John Deterling said the two sidesare not far apart on benefits and could possibly work out a deal onthe chief wage issue, mileage pay.   Under the expired contract, Monson truckers were paid 23.5 centsa mile. At the average rate of 2,500 miles a week, drivers madeabout $30,500 a year under the old contract, with Monson paying forfuel and maintenance on the trucks.   According to the company's latest offer, the mileage rate wouldincrease to 25 cents a mile over three years.   Miller and Deterling said truckers want wages of 26 cents a mile,the amount they were paid before the industry was deregulated.Monson said he stopped trying to negotiate when he was told ``therewould be no contract'' unless the mileage rate was increased by 3cents.   ``They're already above industry standards,'' he said of thewages.   Miller and Deterling said their top priority in negotiating a newcontract is job security, not wages.   Work rules under the old contract made it too easy for thecompany to discriminate against active union members, they said.   They want to alter the company's disciplinary point system, underwhich drivers accumulate points for accidents, speeding and othertraffic violations. A total of 35 points in a year could lead to adriver's dismissal under the expired contract.   Deterling, 55, said he was fired in 1984 when he was assessed 35points for an accident. He said the company offered to rehire himwith no seniority and less vacation pay, but he declined. With theunion's help, he recovered his job and seniority level.   Several employees who were not as active in the union agreed tobe fired and rehired with a loss of seniority after accumulatingmore than 35 points in a year, Deterling said.   Monson would not comment on the point system and other rulechanges sought by the union, including proposed changes in thegrievance policy. But he said the company has never discriminatedagainst union members or anyone else.   The company delivers newsprint from mills in Ontario tonewspapers in the United States and ships ``anything from soup tonuts'' on return trips, Miller said.   The 24-state territory ranges from Ohio to Idaho and as far southas Alabama and Texas.   According to documents filed with the Interstate CommerceCommission, Monson booked $1 million in net operating income for thefirst six months of the year on sales of $8.4 million.</TEXT></DOC>
