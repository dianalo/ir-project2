The polarizable protonswere contained in the molecules of 1-butanol that was frozen in the formof beads and placed in the mixing chamber of a vertical dilution refrigerator.The target system was operated about 200 h for a high precision neutronscattering experiment to test charge symmetry breaking. The highest polarizationachieved was -0.97. The relaxation time was typically 150 h in a magneticfield of 0.257 T and at a temperature of 60 mK.</TEXT></DOC>
