The first part of the report deals with moleculardesigning and complex formation of crown compounds. A crown compoundtends to form a 1 : 1 complex with a metallic ion with a diameter equalto that of the ring of the crown compound. A sandwich-type 2 : 1 complexis likely to form when the ion diameter is larger. Thus, there are twoapproach to designing of such complexes. In one the formation of 1 :1 complexes is promoted to enhance its selectivity while in the otherthe formation of 2 : 1 complexes is accelerated. A variety of studiesare cited which deal with molecular designing for the purpose of increasingthe stability of 1 : 1 and 2 : 1 complexes, producing crown compoundshelpful for non-selective complex formation, and producing complexesthat serve for recognition of optical isomers. The second part of thearticle reviews studies on application of crown compounds to chemicalanalysis, including investigations on ion electrodes, chromatographyand separation-determination. Kinetic studies such as those on ion transportationand switching function are also cited. (Nogami, K.).</TEXT></DOC>
