Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, allegedly linked to the capture ofIsraeli soldiers in Lebanon and the kidnapping of a U.S. Marineheld hostage there, was abducted Friday from his south Lebanon homeand taken to Israel in a helicopter.   ``There may be some people who voice disapproval, but publicopinion will understand that this act was taken against one of theleaders of one of the most fanatical groups in Lebanon,'' saidPrime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's spokesman, Avi Pazner.   Israel and U.S. officials have said Obeid is a leader of theIranian-backed Hezbollah. Obeid has denied belonging to the group.   Israel radio reported Saturday that Sheikh Abbas Musawi, aHezbollah leader who lives in a southern suburb of Beirut, said theorganization will not agree to a prisoner exchange and willincrease attacks on Israel.   The fundamentalist Islamic Hezbollah advocates the destructionof Israel and its replacement by an Iranian-style Islamic state.   In Paris on Saturday, U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez deCuellar called the Israeli raid a ``violation of Lebanesesovereignty.'' He demanded Israel return Obeid.   Egypt accused Israel of state terrorism and said the kidnappingcould lead to increased extremism and violence in the Middle East.   Prime Minister Hussein Musavi of Iran also called the abductionstate terrorism. He issued a statement in Tehran saying, ``Thesekinds of acts will further expand the righteous activities ofLebanese Moslems against Israel and its Phalange followers.''   The Phalange is a right-wing, predominantly Christian party inLebanon.   President Bush said Friday he could not condone the commandoraid and did not know if it would help U.S. Marine Lt. Col WilliamR. Higgins, one of 17 foreigners held hostage in Lebanon.   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher criticized thekidnapping, saying it could hurt the hostages.   Pazner said Saturday, ``I don't remember hearing the same kindof indignation when Sheik Obeid's people were involved in bloodyterrorist attacks from south Lebanon into Israel.''   The Israeli army said Obeid served as commander of Hezbollah insouth Lebanon and that the group had organized at least 20 raids onIsrael and its allies in South Lebanon.   Yossi Sarid, a left-wing Israeli legislator, said, ``Thequestion is not what world public opinion is, but if (the raid) ishelpful in freeing our kidnapped soldiers.''   Three Israeli troopers believed held in Lebanon are soldiersRahamim Alsheikh and Yossi Fink, captured Feb. 17, 1986, whenguerrillas ambushed their patrol, and air force navigator Ron Arad,seized Oct. 16, 1986, when his plane was shot down.   Obeid is the most senior Moslem Shiite leader to be takencaptive in recent months by Israeli forces battling Palestinianguerrillas and pro-Iraninan fundamentalists in south Lebanon.   ``There is no doubt in my mind that the idea here was to have amajor exchange,'' said Aharon Levran, a private strategic analystand brigadier general in the army reserves. ``But I don't thinkthey (Hezbollah) will yield immediately and agree to an exchange.   ``They want him back as soon as possible, but agreeing to atrade would show that Israel has the upper hand, so it won't takeplace immediately.   U.N. spokesman Timor Goksel said Israel is believed to hold 300Lebanese in a prison in south Lebanon run by the Israeli-backedSouth Lebanon Army militia.   Lebanese security sources said Friday that Higgins was heldbriefly in Obeid's apartment after his abduction in February 1988while working as a U.N. monitor on the Israel-Lebanon border.   Seventeen foreign hostages are held in Lebanon, including nineAmericans. The hostage held longest is Terry A. Anderson, chiefMiddle East correspondent of The Associated Press, who waskidnapped March 16, 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
