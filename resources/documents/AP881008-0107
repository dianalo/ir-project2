(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Democratic presidential nominee MichaelDukakis is trying in advance to take the steam out of what he saysare planned National Rifle Association radio commercials in NorthCarolina distorting his position on gun control.   ``It's another outrageous distortion of what I believe,''Dukakis said. ``I've always supported the right of hunters andsportsmen to have weapons and use them, and people to defendthemselves in their homes subject ... to state law.''   He added, ``What I'm concerned about is teen-agers with AK-47sand Uzis that are driving around cities in this country killingpeople, and cop-killer bullets and undetectable plastic guns whichare threatening the safety of people.''   Dukakis discussed the gun-control issue in an interview Fridayafter delivering a campaign speech in this mountain city.   His state campaign spokeswoman, Amy DeHart, said Dukakis wantedan opportunity to clarify his stand on gun control before Monday,when Ms. DeHart said the NRA ads would begin running.   ``They've made a major buy (of air time) for these ads ... totaldistortions of the governor's position,'' Ms. DeHart said.   The NRA also has sent letters to its North Carolina memberscriticizing Dukakis as a gun-control advocate, she said.   David W. Conover, a federal liaison with the Washington-basedNRA, declined to discuss the organization's advertising strategyand said he did not know whether the group would run anti-Dukakiscommercials in North Carolina.   But Conover said the NRA was spreading the word nationwide thatDukakis had favored restrictions on gun ownership in Massachusetts.   ``Throughout his political career, Governor Dukakis has beenopenly hostile to private firearms ownership,'' Conover said in atelephone interview.   He said Dukakis supported a 1976 proposal to ban privateownership of pistols and revolvers in Massachusetts. The measurefailed in a statewide referendum, he said.   Conover said Dukakis had modified his stand since entering thepresidential race, but that the NRA still feared he would supportgun control as president.   Dukakis, in the interview, said, ``If somebody runs thesecommercials ... then obviously I am going to fight back. And I'mnot only going to fight back to clear up the the record; I'm goingto make sure that people in this country really understand how bad(George) Bush's record has been on crime and drugs.''   Ms. DeHart said she had seen scripts of the ads, including onefeaturing actor Charlton Heston criticizing Dukakis on gun controland a Massachusetts prison furlough program.</TEXT></DOC>
