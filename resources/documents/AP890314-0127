The Commerce Department said sales fell to a seasonally adjusted$138.2 billion last month after rising a strong 0.7 percent inJanuary, when business was aided by unusually mild winter weather.   The overall rate was held back by a 1.7 percent drop inautomotive sales last month, the second straight decline in thatcategory. Car sales had dropped 1.7 percent in January and beenvirtually unchanged in December.   Excluding autos, which account for almost one-fourth of theretail total, sales edged down 0.1 percent last month after rising arobust 1.4 percent in January.   The size of February's overall drop in sales last was matched bya 0.4 percent drop in April 1988. The last time there was a biggerdrop was in October 1987, when sales plunged 0.9 percent.   At the White House, press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said, ``Thebottom line is this: It probably helps offset inflationary fears.There's still only one month's figures. January was up, so there'sno trend here. The economy is still sound.''   Retail spending, which accounts for about one-third of the grossnational product, is closely watched as a barometer of economichealth.   Many analysts expect a slowdown in consumer spending this year asrising interest rates start to take their toll, although feweconomists had anticipated a drop in sales for February. The FederalReserve Board for a year has been nudging interest rates upward inan effort to dampen economic growth and thus restrain inflation.   In the key category of department and other general merchandisestores, sales fell 0.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted $10.3billion last month, following a 2 percent rise in January.   In a separate report earlier this month, the nation's largestretailers had reported strong sales for February from year-earlierlevels, spurred by renewed demand for women's apparel and otherconsumer and household goods.   Clothing stores did report a 0.5 percent increase in Februarysales from the previous month.   Among the categories to post big declines in retail sales lastmonth were: building and hardware stores, down 2.5 percent andfurniture and home furnishing stores, down 0.7 percent.   The strongest sales were recorded in the category of gasolinestations, where business was up 0.8 percent.   Sales of durable goods _ ``big ticket'' items expected to last atleast three years _ plunged 1.3 percent last month after an 0.3percent decline in January. The drops were partly of a reflection ofthe slide in auto sales.   The decline in the durable goods sector was the biggest since a2.5 percent drop in October 1987.   Sales of non-durable goods edged up 0.1 percent last month afterrising 1.4 percent in January.   In other categorties, retail sales rose 0.1 percent at groceryand other food stores and at restaurants and bars; and 0.3 percentat drug stores.</TEXT></DOC>
