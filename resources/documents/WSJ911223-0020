It's known that the toughness and flexibility of concretecan be enhanced by mixing carbon fibers into the concrete.But such concrete requires a large volume of expensive carbonfibers and a costly mixing process.   Now the cost has been brought down sharply by DeborahChung, a professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering atthe State University of New York at Buffalo. She hasdeveloped a way to make fiber-reinforced concrete usingone-tenth as many fibers as were needed previously and usingonly the cheapest fibers, those derived from pitch. Thesecret is a set of cheap chemical additives that cause thetiny fibers to disperse in the concrete, making the mixingsimpler. The chemicals also cause the fibers to bond morefirmly to the concrete.   At present, the fibers and chemicals would boost the costof the concrete by 39%, but this premium would drop if thefibers were produced in volume, Dr. Chung says. For the extracost, highway builders would get a concrete with a 200% boostin ability to withstand repeated bending, ideal for bridgespounded by heavy vehicles and flexed by temperature extremes.The concrete also shrinks less as it hardens, meaning fewerdestructive cracks and gaps in pothole patches.   The new concrete will be field-tested next summer underthe National Research Council's federally funded StrategicHighway Research Program. But persuading the low-technologycement industry to offer a new concrete may be a hard sell,Dr. Chung concedes.                                                                                                          Mothering Instinct   Is Traced to Hormones                                                                                                          THE HORMONE that triggers the urge to cuddle and to&quot;mother&quot; in mammals is being tracked down by federalscientists.   The experiments by psychiatrist Thomas Insel of theNational Institute of Mental Health and psychologist LarryShapiro use two species of voles -- mouselike creatures withshort tails. The prairie vole tends to be loving, quick toplay and cuddle with the opposite sex, and it lives in familygroups. &quot;Both parents care for the young, and the motherprairie vole searches frantically if a pup gets lost,&quot; Dr.Insel says.   In contrast, the montane vole is a loner, with parentsliving in separate burrows. Montane mother voles don'tattempt to find lost offspring and usually desert their pupsafter two weeks.   The researchers find that brain cells of the nurturingprairie voles are highly receptive to the hormone oxytocin.On the other hand, the brain cells of the antisocial montanevoles have few oxytocin &quot;receptors&quot; and presumably aren'tstrongly influenced by the hormone.   In rats and other animals, Dr. Insel says, injections ofchemicals that block the action of oxytocin, if given beforebirth, will inhibit the mother's nurturing behaviorafterward, but won't have any effect if given after birth.This suggests oxytocin is a kind of trigger for mothering butnot the hormone that sustains it.   In humans, oxytocin is known to trigger labor andlactation. Synthetic oxytocin has been long and widely usedto induce labor and stanch post-delivery bleeding. But itseffects on human nurturing and sexual behavior haven't beenstudied.                                                                                                          Gene Tests Are Coming   For Gaucher's Carriers                                                                                                          THE DAMAGED GENE that causes Gaucher's disease can now bedetected in healthy persons.   In Gaucher's disease, a defective gene fails to make anenzyme that breaks down fat in spleen, liver and bone-marrowcells. This leads to swelling of the spleen and liver that,until recently, could be treated only by surgery.   About 500,000 Americans, most of whom are Ashkenazi Jews,don't know they carry a single, harmless copy of theGaucher's disease gene unless they and another silent carrierof the gene bear a child who inherits two copies of the geneand develops the disease. Some 2,000 to 3,000 cases ofGaucher's disease are diagnosed each year in the U.S.   Until a few weeks ago, silent carriers could be identifiedonly in families where a child had the disease. But now,three different mutations of the gene have been uncovered,any one of which can cause Gaucher's disease, according toscientists at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla,Calif. Collectively, the mutations account for 97% of allcases of the disorder among Ashkenazi Jews.   With most of the mutations identified, genetic counselorscan give highly reliable counseling on a couple's chances ofhaving a child with Gaucher's disease. It also means thebattery of genetic tests that might be used someday to screenhealthy people can include Gaucher's disease, along withcystic fibrosis, Tay-Sachs disease and sickle-cell anemia.   Meanwhile, Genzyme in Boston is in final clinical testingof a gene-spliced version of the missing enzyme for treatingGaucher's disease. The natural version, sold by Genzyme sinceearly this year, is extracted in minute amounts from humanplacenta and is the most expensive drug ever marketed,costing $50,000 to $800,000 a year to treat each patient.                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          TESTS by radiation physicists at the Mayo Clinic find thatX-rays and magnetic fields of airport security scanners arefar too weak to damage computer &quot;floppy&quot; disks. . . .

In yesterday's editions,researchers at the Scripps Research Institute cited an annualcost of $50,000 to $800,000.   (WSJ Dec. 24, 1991)</TEXT></DOC>
