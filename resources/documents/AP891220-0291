Gold investors appeared to discard news of the military action,as prices edged higher in New York after falling in Europe andAsia. Republic National Bank in New York quoted a bid for a troyounce of gold at $413.05 as of 4 p.m. EST, up $1.30 from Tuesday'slate bid.   The dollar wound up lower against every major currency exceptthe Japanese yen and Canadian dollar in New York. In Europe, itrose against the yen, Canadian dollar and Dutch guilder, but fellagainst other major currencies.   Dealers in Europe said the dollar rose early in the trading dayin reaction to news of the U.S. military action in Panama.   But the dollar reversed course midway through the U.S. tradingday when the Federal Reserve took steps to inject reserves into thefinancial system, a move that was viewed as a sign that it may beencouraging lower interest rates.   Falling interest rates reduce demand for dollars because thedecline cuts the yields available to foreigners on theirdollar-denominated investments.   Richard Levine, vice president for foreign exchange and preciousmetals at Elders Futures Inc. in New York, said trading wasrelatively light all day.   ``You could tell there was no real conviction,'' he said,referring to the market's assessment of the impact of both themilitary action and the Fed's move to make more money availablewithin the financial system.   He said the market viewed the U.S. military action as ``a signof strength'' but recognized the move was a ``limited regionalaction'' which was not likely to have global ramifications.   The subsequent decline in the dollar also came on low volume,Levine said, because traders remember that they misinterpreted asimilar move by the central bank a few weeks ago as an indicationit was easing its credit policy.   He also noted that as the end of the year approaches, banks thatotherwise would be active in the currency markets are not trading.``Most of the major banks have squared their banks for the year,''he said.
