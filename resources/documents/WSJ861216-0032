The owner and franchiser of seafood restaurants said it plans a $3 million write-off associated with its plans to close seven unprofitable restaurants it operates, and to try to franchise six other restaurants owned by the company.    For the 36 weeks ended Sept. 7, the company had net income of $143,000, or five cents a share, on revenue of $54.8 million. Skipper's said the planned write-off means it will have a 1986 net loss of between $1 million and $1.5 million. </TEXT></DOC>
