But the big British beverage, food and hotel group can't make its #330 million ($614 million) offer until it clears some hurdles in France, including approval by the Paris Stock Exchange. Exchange officials declined to say whether they would let Grand Met proceed.    However, Paris bourse authorities said they plan to issue a statement today about the accord between Martell family interests and Seagram, the Montreal-based distiller. The exchange may oppose the Martell-Seagram agreement, following scrutiny of Grand Met allegations that the transaction would breach French stock market rules.    Grand Met said it plans to offer Martell holders 2,675 French francs a share and to extend comparable terms to holders of Martell's convertible bonds. The offer, disclosed to the stock exchange last Thursday, would depend on Grand Met receiving acceptances from holders representing at least 51% of Martell shares outstanding.    A Grand Met spokesman said the exchange approved its announcement yesterday. But the bid can't proceed without approval from both the exchange and the French Treasury. If the exchange criticizes the Seagram offer today, the Grand Met spokesman added, &quot;things could happen very quickly&quot; and the British company might launch its counterbid by mid-January.    Grand Met's proposed bid would be about 7% higher than the 2,500 francs a share that Seagram agreed to pay Martell family interests for a 40% stake earlier this month. The Seagram transaction, valued at almost 1.3 billion francs, would boost the Canadian company's holding to 52% from 12%.    Grand Met, which raised its Martell holding earlier this month to 19.9% from 10%, was enraged by Seagram's subsequent proposal. The British concern claimed the Seagram purchase would violate French regulations requiring that the acquisition of publicly quoted shares be made through a broker.    A spokesman for Seagram said, &quot;We remain comfortable with our agreement with the Martell family, which was executed in full compliance with all applicable regulations and would give Seagram majority control of the company, subject to French government approval.&quot;    At a Martell shareholders meeting two weeks ago, Grand Met officials said they would challenge the validity of the proposed Seagram share purchase. The British concern also it was considering making its own higher offer for all of Martell &quot;in compliance with French market procedures.&quot;    Martell officials couldn't be reached for comment on Grand Met's latest move.    The Paris exchange can't approve or block the Seagram-Martell agreement. But the views of bourse officials could influence the French Finance Ministry, which does have the final say.    The exchange's expected statement today likely will reflect findings of a joint Finance Ministry-stock exchange commission that recently examined the proposed Martell share sale. A Finance Ministry official wouldn't comment on the panel's findings, but said a date hasn't been set for a final ruling on the sale of Martell shares to Seagram.    In its statement yesterday, Grand Met said it would &quot;seek to maintain the continued involvement of the Martell family in the management of the company.&quot; Grand Met &quot;wanted to make clear that there is no rift with the family as far as we are concerned,&quot; the spokesman said.    It isn't clear whether the Martell family is legally bound by its commitment to sell the 40% stake to Seagram, financial analysts stressed. Analysts also said it is unclear whether Seagram might mount a revised bid for 100% of Martell if the French government blocked its pending agreement.    &quot;A higher offer is now firmly on the table, but it's still up to the family and the French Treasury to make up their minds,&quot; said John Spicer, a beverage industry analyst at Kleinwort Grieveson Securities, a London brokerage. Mr. Spicer noted that Grand Met's planned bid would value Martell at about 30 times earnings in the fiscal year ended last June. &quot;That is a high level. But Martell is a very important brand -- the kind that doesn't come up very often,&quot; he said.    In trading late yesterday on London's Stock Exchange, Grand Met shares gained 12 pence to 462 pence after reaching 467 pence immediately before its Martell announcement. Seagram closed at $55.125, up 37.5 cents, yesterday in American Stock Exchange composite trading. </TEXT></DOC>
