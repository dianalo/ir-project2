The activists are lobbying intensely behind thescenes and threaten demonstrations to force the company tohalve its price.   Company officials, in turn, say the price is necessary torecoup the investment in the drug. They argue that theactivists are using the issue to highlight broader complaintsabout the scope of AIDS research.</LP><TEXT>   The battle, simmering for months, is expected to boil oversoon, especially after this week's New England Journal ofMedicine publishes a major study suggesting that patients onFoscavir lived longer than those taking a competing product.If true, thousands of patients may rush to use the Astradrug, draining funds from strapped health budgets.   Foscavir treats cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis, ablinding viral infection that afflicts about 30% of peoplewith AIDS. Astra's U.S. subsidiary, Astra PharmaceuticalProducts Inc. in Westborough, Mass., is selling a day's worthof the drug for $58, making it the most expensive approvedtreatment for AIDS.   The controversy over Foscavir goes to the heart of twoprickly and unresolved issues surrounding AIDS research: Candrug makers charge enough to pay for their research and canpatients, for the first time, dictate pharmaceutical prices?   Foscavir's price &quot;is outrageous and indefensible,&quot; saysPeter Staley, head of Treatment Activist Group, New York.&quot;I'm very aware that companies need profits as an incentiveto do research. But if we let one company charge this much,others will want to do the same. The price won't stand.&quot;   Mr. Staley says his group's members are taking lessons incivil disobedience from Greenpeace, the environmental group.&quot;Something is in the works,&quot; he adds obliquely.   While most pharmaceutical companies don't discuss how muchit costs to develop a drug, Astra says the high price ofFoscavir is needed to recover $100 million in research anddevelopment costs. But many people familiar with drugresearch are skeptical of the figure. Despite repeatedrequests from activists and recent inquiries from Congress,Astra has declined to document its expenses or undergo anindependent audit.   Data gleaned from researchers and several federal agenciesnow suggest that Astra's claims may be exaggerated. Totalspending for all tests of the drug in the U.S. since 1987probably add up to less than $15 million, at least two-thirdsof which came from the federal government.   In fact, the U.S. testing of the drug was initiated by twoAmerican doctors, not by Astra, which was marketing the drugonly for limited use in Europe. Food and Drug Administrationofficials say the agency's unusually quick approval ofFoscavir was based largely on the results of just twoclinical trials, both designed by the federal government andinvolving only 88 patients. The combined federal tab forthose trials was less than $1 million, while Astracontributed Foscavir and paid for statistical analyses, acost researchers estimate at an additional $1 million.   Astra says those figures are misleading because they don'tinclude research costs dating back to the 1970s, when thedrug was discovered in Sweden and tested as a herpestreatment. It also fails to account for manufacturing anddistribution costs, and bills for ongoing tests to expand thedrug's uses. Stefan Solvell, senior vice president forfinance and administration at Astra's U.S. unit, says hiscompany won't publicly document these costs because &quot;drugmakers can't tell competitors what it costs to do research.&quot;   Nonetheless, he says the company has priced Foscavir onthe assumption that no more than 5,000 patients a year willuse the drug. Because CMV retinitis hits when AIDS is at adeadly stage, many Foscavir users will live an average ofonly six months to a year, meaning Astra's annual revenuewould be about $50 million. AIDS activists say usage could bethree or four times that amount.   Says Mr. Solvell: &quot;We have told everyone that we arewilling to lower the price if after six months it turns outthat many more patients are using it.&quot;   One AIDS researcher says Astra is &quot;getting a bad rap.&quot;Fred A. Ussery, an eye doctor in Houston who conducted someof the earliest tests of Foscavir, estimates that onlyone-third or fewer of the 12,000 AIDS patients with CMV willuse it. &quot;I'll bet the company barely turns a profit on thedrug,&quot; Dr. Ussery says.   Dr. Ussery first puts his CMV patients on a less expensivedrug called ganciclovir, sold under the brand name Cytoveneby Syntex Corp. in Palo Alto, Calif. Both drugs must be takenintravenously. But Foscavir requires dosing three times aday, while ganciclovir, approved two years ago, is taken oncedaily. In addition, Foscavir's side effects can be morebothersome than ganciclovir's. Yet doctors say both drugs areneeded because patients often develop resistance to them.   Use of Foscavir could surge with the publication of afederally run study that was abruptly halted in September.The study, to be printed in the New England Journal ofMedicine this week, showed both drugs were equally effectiveon CMV retinitis. But researchers were stunned when aninterim review found patients on Foscavir were living anaverage of 12 months from when they began taking the drug,compared with eight months for those on ganciclovir.   The finding is controversial. Thomas Merigan, an AIDSresearcher at Stanford University, says the longevity may bedue to factors other than Foscavir's effectiveness. SandraKweder, an FDA official, says the agency is resisting Astra'srequests that it be allowed to include the difference inmaterials for marketing the drug to doctors.   &quot;If we can't {tell doctors} that Foscavir is better, thereis no way we will get the kind of expanded use we need tolower the price,&quot; Astra's Mr. Solvell says.   Indeed, some activists and AIDS researchers say Astra'sclaim that it spent heavily to develop Foscavir is ironicsince it didn't even fund the comparative study that couldlead to much wider use of the drug. The National EyeInstitute says it paid more than 90% of the study's $10million cost, with Astra, Syntex and private health insurerspaying the rest.   And some activists say that whether Astra actuallyincurred costs of $100 million is beside the point. &quot;I refuseto debate the figures with Astra,&quot; says Martin Delaney,director of Project Inform, San Francisco. &quot;We believe $58 aday for a drug needed to keep some people from going blind isunconscionably high.&quot;   Though some patients have the cost covered by privateinsurance, state Medicaid and other programs will have to payfor the rest, draining funds from other treatment programs,Mr. Delaney and other note. The activists are pressing Astrato cap yearly outlays for Foscavir at $10,000 a patient.   Activists say they are convinced Astra will back down.They maintain that most U.S. companies have learned in recentyears that pricing AIDS drugs high will set off a firestormof complaints, and that Astra merely is learning that lesson.   But Dr. Ussery says he and other researchers worry aboutthe consequences. &quot;Drugs must be affordable, but companiesneed to make profits,&quot; he says. &quot;I don't know how this willget resolved.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
