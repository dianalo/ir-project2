Leo Hollander, owner of Hollander Home Fashions of Newark, N.J.,said the company stopped making its ``Mother's Helper Cushion'' inJanuary and told distributors to remove them from stores.   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., urged the Consumer Product SafetyCommission on Tuesday to recall all the infant pillows that havebeen linked to the deaths, inlcuding seven since June.   ``It's time to get get the product off the shelves and out ofthe hands of consumers before any other children are put at risk,''D'Amato said.   Hollander said his company ``does not believe that its productis responsible for the death of any infant. ... The productlabeling warns parents never to leave their children unattended.''   He said infants under 5-months-old should never be placed facedown and left alone to sleep on any type of pillows.   ``Furthermore no pillow should be used for very young infants intheir cribs,'' he said.   CPSC spokesman Dan Rumelt said the company voluntarily recalled400,000 cushions Wednesday.   But Hollander said the company did not recall cushions bought byconsumers and only took the action with its distributors ``awaitingCPSC determination.''   ``The CPSC has not determined that this product is the cause ofthis problem,'' he said.   The agency on Tuesday warned parents not to let infants sleep onthe miniature bean bags because 10 babies using the items havesuffocated since December 1987.   ``As a result of our investigation we know that at least 10companies manufacture a similar product,'' Rumelt said.   The agency said negotiations for a recall were continuing withother companies, which it declined to identify.</TEXT></DOC>
