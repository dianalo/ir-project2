The White House announced that punitive tariffs on $84.4 million of annual imports of certain Japanese computers, color television sets and power tools will be lifted, effective Tuesday at noon. The announcement followed a finding by the administration that the Japanese have stopped &quot;dumping&quot; their chips -- selling them at prices below the cost of production or below the home-market price -- in third countries.    The president's action will leave punitive tariffs on about $164 million of the $300 million of Japanese goods covered by the White House sanctions last spring. The president last summer lifted sanctions from $51 million of the Japanese imports. The remaining tariffs will stay in place because of &quot;lack of sufficient progress&quot; in bilateral efforts to increase the U.S. share of the Japanese semiconductor market, President Reagan said.    Claiming that the administration won Japan's cooperation on the third-country dumping problem as a result of &quot;judicious and proper use&quot; of existing trade law, Mr. Reagan appealed to Congress to drop certain provisions of the pending trade bill that would make presidential retaliation in such cases mandatory rather than optional as the current law allows.    &quot;Retaliation ought to be used as a last resort and only when it is likely to lead to a positive result,&quot; Mr. Reagan said.    U.S. trade officials said the administration's latest decision will remove punitive tariffs from $19 million in annual imports of Japanese low-performance desktop computers with certain 16-bit microprocessors; $38.5 million in imports of 18-to-19-inch color television sets; $17.1 million in imports of grinders, sanders and polishers; and $9.8 million in rotary drills.    The remaining sanctions cover $161 million in imports of other computer products, including laptop computers and high-performance desktop computers, and $3 million in imports of electro-pneumatic hammers.    The Semiconductor Industry Association, which represents the U.S. industry, said it supported Mr. Reagan's decision. But it urged the president to keep the semiconductor trade accord with Japan active to prevent renewed dumping. The U.S. had said it imposed the trade sanctions because Japan violated the accord.    However, the Computer and Business Equipment Manufacturers Association, which represents many U.S. semiconductor users, complained that the remaining sanctions, which cover imports of Japanese printed circuit boards, continue to hurt its members. &quot;We're losing hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Customs Service every day,&quot; said Oliver Smoot, the association's acting president.    The sanctions are in the form of 100% additional duties on the designated products. The U.S. Customs Service, which collects the duties, earlier ruled that the circuit boards are subject to the tariffs.    U.S. industry sources said the president's action was influenced in part by a desire to ease certain unintended effects of the sanctions on U.S. computer manufacturers, who are among the world's largest semiconductor users. Many of these manufacturers have complained that their accustomed supply of Japanese semiconductors has been reduced by Japanese policies that ostensibly were intended to curb dumping.    Tokyo had sought to curb dumping by ordering its semiconductor manufacturers to cut their production generally. But Mr. Reagan said he was assured by the Japanese government that it won't in the future restrict the production or shipment of semiconductors or allocate production in ways that would &quot;disadvantage foreign purchasers.&quot; Instead, Tokyo said, it would monitor production costs and export prices on a &quot;company-to-company&quot; basis as a deterrent against dumping, the White House said. </TEXT></DOC>
