Unless all three of United's major unions participate in theproposed labor-management buyout, they are apt to lose to Californiainvestor Marvin Davis in the bidding war for UAL Corp., analystspredict.   ``Price alone is not going to be the whole story,'' said EdwardStarkman, an airline industry analyst with PaineWebber Inc. ``Whatreally makes this deal go or not is the cooperation of labor.''   The rancor that some United mechanics and ground-crew workerspreviously expressed privately rose bitterly to the surface Tuesdayin a stinging statement from their union, the Machinists.   ``We are very skeptical that United Airlines could survive intoday's marketplace with the additional debt that would be placed onthe carrier under this proposal ... particularly since the proposedpurchase price far exceeds the value of the airline,'' said JohnPeterpaul, general vice president of the Machinists.   Federal officials also have been concerned about airline buyoutsfinanced with heavy loads of debt.   UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf was planning to discuss details of themanagement-labor buyout in a meeting today in Washington withTransportation Secretary Samuel Skinner, according to the ChicagoTribune.   Transportation officials have said they would consider leveragedairline buyouts case by case. They have indicated that they mightpull a carrier's operating certificate if an extreme debt burdenwere to endanger its ability to run a safe operation.   Although he said the enormous new debt is the Machinists' mainconcern, Peterpaul also said the union opposes any transaction as ameans of staving off an unwanted takeover attempt. The Machinists,representing 25,000 of United's 70,000 employees, have supportedrecapitalization as a way to fight Davis.   In a recapitalization to avoid takeover, a company typically paysshareholders a large, special dividend financed by borrowed money,making it less lucrative for shareholders to sell their stock to araider and leaving the company less attractive due to the new debt.   The Machinist statement included a slap at the pilot-managementcooperation that led to the $300-a-share bid announced by the groupFriday.   ``It is apparent that United's management, who has been locked ina long struggle with the Air Line Pilots Association for a new(contract) agreement, is using this ALPA-management proposal tosolve its problems with one union by passing the burden ... fromstockholders to other employees,'' Peterpaul said.   He said the pilot-management bid was nearly $2 billion more thanUnited is worth.   ALPA spokesman Hank Krakowski said the pilot-management proposal,which would create the nation's largest employee-controlled company,is based solely on participation of United's 6,300 pilots. But, headded, ``it is our strong desire to have all employees on board thisproposal.''   The Association of Flight Attendants, which represents 12,700United workers, remains open to discussing participation in abuyout, said spokeswoman Patricia Friend.   Privately, some Machinists have said the pilots' leaders are tooclose to management. Some bitterness also stems from the fact thatpilots are paid more than Machinists.   Joseph Blasi, a professor at Rutgers University in New Brunswick,N.J., said Tuesday that an employee-owned company works better ifall employees share in ownership.   ``The differences between pilots and Machinists boil down to adisagreement about who is more important and who deserves higherwages,'' said Blasi, who has written several books on employee stockownership plans.   Those differences, Blasi said, ``can be resolved better togetherthan with speculative takeover raiders.''   Peterpaul said the Machinists had not been invited to participatein any discussions regarding the pilot-management proposal, but thatthey were keeping their options open and ``would not hestitate tomeet with the appropriate parties'' to discuss United's future.   The bid by the pilot-management alliance has financial backingfrom British Airways PLC.   If successful, it would result in 75 percent employee ownership.British Airways would own 15 percent of the company and UAL'smanagement, led by Wolf, would hold 10 percent.   Davis, a billionaire who put UAL into play last month with a$240-a-share offer that he later sweetened to $275, was reportedlyseeking the help of foreign airlines in an attempt to outbid theinsider group.   The New York Times quoted an unidentified source in the Daviscamp as saying Davis was talking with European and non-Europeancarriers.   The Davis group did not return telephone calls Tuesday seekingconfirmation of the report.</TEXT></DOC>
