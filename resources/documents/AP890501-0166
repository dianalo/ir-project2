(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Comedian Joe Piscopo suffered a legaldefeat Monday when a state appeals court upheld most of a divorcejudgment in which his ex-wife received about $500,000 in jointassets and custody of their only child.   The three-judge panel also ruled it was not unreasonable torequire Piscopo to pay $40,000 a year in child support, andrejected his argument that his ex-wife should not have been allowedto move to Florida with his son.   The movie actor and former ``Saturday Night Live'' regular'sex-wife, Nancy Piscopo Hayes, has remarried since the 1988 divorcedecree. Their son is 10 years old.   The appeals court also upheld an award to Mrs. Hayes of $50,000,which was half the value placed on Piscopo's celebrity status.   ``We're disappointed that the Appellate Division did not reversethe trial court, especially on the issue of Joe's son being removedto Florida,'' said Piscopo's attorney, Francis Donahue.   Donahue said he would discuss with Piscopo whether to take thecase to the state Supreme Court. Piscopo, a former resident ofAlpine, now lives in Sneden's Landing, N.Y.   Mrs. Hayes' attorney, Charles Abut, said his client was ``verypleased and hopes that with this ruling the litigation can be putto a rest and the child, who's the most important asset of thismarriage, can be allowed to develop normally outside the courtsystem.''   Abut also defended the $40,000-a-year child-support judgment.   `The testimony was that Mr. Piscopo in the last year before thetrial was making $700,000 to $800,000, so a child support award of$40,000 is very reasonable,'' he said.   The appellate court relied largely on established matrimoniallaw in ruling that the couple's assets should be evenly divided andthat Mrs. Hayes should receive about $500,000 in property and money.   The court noted she had largely supported the couple whilePiscopo finished college and started his comedy career.   During the first decade of the marriage, until he landed the``Saturday Night Live'' role in 1980, she also assisted his careerby typing his scripts and helping him learn his lines.   The court rejected arguments that the mother's move to Floridawas detrimental to the child.   The court cited trial testimony that indicated there is a greatdeal of animosity by Piscopo toward his ex-wife, and that he hadexpressed such views in front of the child.   The court also noted Piscopo's arguments that the child andtheir relationship will suffer from being far away from his father.   The court ruled there is no evidence the child will suffer fromthe move and that Piscopo has ample personal resources to keep up aweekly visitation schedule. It noted that in January alone, Piscopotraveled to seven cities in four states to make appearances.   The court also agreed with the Superior Court judge's rulingthat the Florida living arrangements add some structure to thecomedian's visits with his son.   ``The trial judge found, and (Piscopo) admitted that hefrequently went to Joey's school unannounced and took Joey out ofschool; that he frequently made the child choose which parentshould take him from school; and that he asked the child `hundredsof times' if he wanted to go to Florida,'' the court ruled.</TEXT></DOC>
