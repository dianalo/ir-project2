The department earlier tried to reach a settlement with the company that would have resulted in smaller fines, but Chicago-based Sara Lee decided to contest the case. The agency charged that action taken as part of Sara Lee's attempts to register a trademark in Kuwait and other Arab countries constituted 235 separate violations of a law that prohibits U.S. companies from cooperating with the Arab economic boycott of Israel.    Gordon Newman, Sara Lee's senior vice president and general counsel, protested that the charges are &quot;misleading and grossly exaggerated&quot; and that the department's method of calculating the number of violations is &quot;absurd.&quot; Each of the violations is punishable with a fine of $10,000.    Mr. Newman said the company merely forwarded to Kuwait in 1982 four documents with the names and nationalities of its 39 officers and board members and the names of its 190 U.S. and foreign subsidiaries. The company said the documents were filed for no other reason than to register its L'eggs panty-hose brand in these Arab countries, but that there was no intention of assisting the boycott.    The department said that such information could be used by Kuwait to determine the extent of Sara Lee's business dealings with Israel, and could serve as the basis of extending the boycott to other U.S. companies.    Sara Lee's refusal to settle its anti-boycott case is the second such action by a large U.S. company in the past three months. In August, Safeway Stores Inc. denied similar charges and now is defending itself before a Commerce Department administrative law judge. Safeway faces potential fines totaling nearly $4.5 million.    The Commerce Department said the Sara Lee case also will be heard by an administrative law judge. If the law judge rules against Sara Lee, it could appeal to Paul Freedenberg, acting undersecretary of commerce for export administration.    The successive challenges could reflect a feeling among U.S. companies operating in the Mideast that the anti-boycott law is being enforced too strictly. &quot;If we inadvertently violated a very complex and highly technical law by providing already public information in an effort to protect our trademark overseas, it certainly was not done as an action against Israel,&quot; said Mr. Newman, the Sara Lee counsel.    Mr. Newman said Sara Lee itself has been an Arab boycott victim since it entered a joint venture with an Israeli chemical concern in 1976. </TEXT></DOC>
