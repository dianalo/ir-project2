The buy-back plan was announced in November 1986 when Gillette blocked a takeover attempt by Revlon Group Inc. by agreeing to purchase Revlon's 13.9% stake in Gillette at a premium. Since then, Gillette has purchased about three million of the 14 million shares authorized for purchase under the program, a company spokesman said. Gillette has about 115 million shares outstanding.    Gillette added that upon completion of its buy-back program, it &quot;will consider&quot; additional buy-backs, depending on market and other conditions.    According to some people familiar with the proxy fight, the timing of the announcement of the buy-back acceleration may be connected with the hotly contested battle between Gillette and Coniston Partners. Coniston, a New York investment group that holds a 5.9% stake in Gillette, is seeking four seats on Gillette's board. &quot;I'm sure you would have to say (the buy-back announcement) was connected to the proxy fight and an attempt to increase the value&quot; of the company's stock, said Jeffrey Ashenberg, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds.    Asserted Augustus Oliver, one of Coniston's partners: &quot;Obviously, (the buy-back acceleration) is intended to affect the outcome of the proxy contest. I don't think it will. The question is why didn't Gillette complete the repurchase months ago when the stock was a lot cheaper?&quot;    A Gillette spokesman declined to comment on reasons for the acceleration.    In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Gillette closed at $42, down 37.5 cents.    Moody's Investors Service said it placed Gillette's Baa-1 long-term debt ratings and prime-2 commercial paper ratings under review for possible downgrade because of Gillette's stock buy-back acceleration. Moody's said the planned repurchases and potential future buy-backs &quot;would result in a significant increase in financial leverage&quot; for Gillette. Additionally, Moody's said &quot;there is substantial uncertainty as to the future control and operations&quot; of Gillette because of its proxy fight with Coniston. A Gillette spokesman said the action by Moody's is &quot;nothing unusual.&quot;    Separately, Coniston said it filed a countersuit against Gillette in U.S. District Court in Boston, charging that Gillette violated Securities and Exchange Commission rules by making false and misleading charges in an earlier suit against Coniston. As previously reported, Gillette's suit, filed last week, charged that Coniston violated federal securities laws by not disclosing &quot;hidden&quot; partners. Gillette's suit asks the court to void proxies obtained by Coniston as a result of any misleading solicitations.    The Gillette spokesman declined to comment on Coniston's countersuit, pending a review of it. </TEXT></DOC>
