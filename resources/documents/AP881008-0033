(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two years ago, an activist group describeda near catastrophe at the Savannah River nuclear plant in 1965 butthe report largely went unnoticed.   This week the incident was detailed by The New York Times,proving, the activists say, that they are not the ``kooks'' they'vebeen called for years.   ``I'm glad that people are beginning to pay attention,'' saidFrancis Close Hart, chairwoman of the South Carolina EnergyFoundation, a natural resource policy and education group. ``We'vebeen saying this kind of thing for a long time.''   Officials of Du Pont Co., the plant's operator, insisted Fridaythat the U.S. government plant _ the nation's sole producer ofweapons-grade plutonium and tritium _ is safe.   ``We believe these facilities are safe; otherwise, we would notoperate these facilities. We have never had an accident that hasput the community around us or our employees at risk,'' said JimFelder, manager of public relations for Du Pont at the sprawlingoperation in Aiken, near the Georgia line.   Du Pont President Edgar S. Woolard sent a telegram to four U.S.senators Friday saying the company welcomed their call for a reviewof the plant's operations following a congressional hearing inwhich the U.S. Energy Department disclosed 30 serious mishaps thatpreviously were kept secret.   The New York Times' story, based on a memo found in a publicdocument room at the University of South Carolina in Aiken, saidsome cooling water leaked in a reactor and a foreman wanted toclose valves that limit the cooling water supply.   The foreman's senior supervisor prevented the valves from beingclosed, narrowly averting disaster, according to the Du Pontengineer who wrote the memo.   The foundation's report two years ago quoted the same engineerand said closing the valves would have caused the reactor todestroy itself.   Ms. Hart said the Times' story was the ``most dramatic'' exampleshe knew of the popular press catching up with news her group hasreported.   ``I'm not one to say I told you so,'' said Michael Lowe, anuclear specialist with the environmental group Greenpeace. ``Onthe other hand, I'm glad we're able to say I told you so nowinstead of when one of these accidents get out of hand.''   Though activists have for the last decade pointed to problems atthe plant, they've learned during the past two weeks more detailsabout safety problems there.   Michael Clark, president of the Washington-based EnvironmentalPolicy Institute, a non-profit environmental research and advocacygroup, said his group used the federal Freedom of Information Actto obtain 50,000 pages of information about the plant.   But, he said, that information only revealed two of the 30serious mishaps listed in a document made public by the federalEnergy Department at the congressional hearing a week ago.   ``We are now wondering what else is going on there that thepublic hasn't been told about,'' he said. ``It's a rogue operation.It's out of control.'' About 100 protesters have been arrested atthe plant during the last decade, according to leaders of the GrassRoots Organizing Workshop, a group based in Columbia that organizedthe major protests at the plant.   ``It's clear that people who had been calling us kooks 10 yearsago are now saying the same thing we were'' about the safetyproblems, said Brett Bursey, the group's director.</TEXT></DOC>
