(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Legislators who passed the nation's firstlaw requiring instant background checks on people wanting to buycertain guns say they hope to end Virginia's reputation as asupplier of firearms to drug dealers.   The deadline for signing the bill is midnight Monday; Gov.Gerald L. Baliles has said he supports the measure and is expectedto sign it. It would take effect Nov. 1.   Debate on the bill saw weapons drawn in the halls of the GeneralAssembly.   The sponsor of the measure took a Soviet-designed AK-47 assaultrifle to a Senate committee hearing, saying he wanted to show thatdangerous guns can be sold to anyone who has the money. Sen. M.E.``Sonny'' Stallings said the gun was similar to one that was usedto wound him when he served in Vietnam.   The measure awaiting Baliles' signature is designed to keepassault rifles and handguns with barrels 5 inches long or less outof the hands of convicted and wanted felons. It sets up instantbackground checks on resident purchasers; non-residents may have towait up to a week while the checks are made before they can takehome a gun.   The system will be similar to that used by merchants checkingthe validity of a credit card. Gun dealers, after checking apurchaser's identification, will call a toll-free number operatedby the State Police. In minutes, an officer at a State Policecomputer terminal will determine if the purchaser has a criminalrecord.   At present in Virginia, there are no identification requirementsor other state restrictions on gun purchases. Gun owners who wantto carry a concealed weapon need a permit, but for others, nolicense is required and no registration files are maintained.   Washington Mayor Marion Barry referred to the state's reputationas a gun exporter a week ago when he put some of the blame for hiscity's high murder rate on Virginia guns.   The impetus for the measure came in December when a student at aschool in Stallings' hometown of Virginia Beach was charged withkilling a teacher and wounding another with an assault gun.   The final measure, which passed the Senate 33-6 and the House ofDelegates 81-15 in February, was a carefully crafted compromise tosatisfy gun dealers, gun control advocates and firearms owners.   ``What we basically have is a win-win situation from thestandpoint of everyone concerned,'' said Raymond W. Cahen of theVirginia State Rifle and Revolver Association.   Gun owners lobbied for the instant-check provision because theydid not want gun buyers to have to wait for days before taking hometheir purchases. They also won a provision preventing informationin criminal background checks from being used as registration files.   Gun dealers lobbied to make sure they would not be swamped withpaperwork. The law places most of the record-keeping burden onState Police.   Advocates of gun control wanted an outright ban on sales ofmilitary-type rifles and small handguns but accepted backgroundchecks as a first step.   State Delegate C. Richard Cranwell, who wrote most of thecompromise language, said his aim was to fix Virginia's reputationas an exporter of guns to East Coast drug dealers.   ``I want to make sure those people buy their firearms somewhereelse,'' he said.   Charles Cunningham, state liaison with the National RifleAssociation in Washington, said Virginia is the first state to havean instant background checks law, although the Justice Departmentis looking into such a requirement nationwide.   Cunningham said the NRA wants instant checks to replace waitingperiods or license requirements in states that have such laws.</TEXT></DOC>
