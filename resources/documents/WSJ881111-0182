Gordon Crovitz </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><TEXT>   Now we know why the Iran-Contra committee decided last year not to subpoena Michael Ledeen to testify after all. He would have told the congressmen what they didn't want to hear.    Instead, Mr. Ledeen wrote &quot;Perilous Statecraft: An Insider's Account of the Iran-Contra Affair&quot; (Scribner's, 307 pages, $19.95), the most compelling book yet on the subject. Mr. Ledeen was an early participant in the Iran initiative and, with a background as a bridge champion, has the kind of mind that can wrap itself around the complexities of the foreign policy issues and the colorful personalities involved in the affair.    In 1985, National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane asked Mr. Ledeen, a historian and NSC consultant, to be his courier to the Middle East. One task was to find some way to put the U.S. in a better position for a post-Ayatollah Iran. The key was Manucher Ghorbanifar, a fascinating and, according to Mr. Ledeen, misunderstood figure.    Mr. Ghorbanifar was a self-made businessman in pre-revolutionary Iran. The Ayatollah Khomeini's forces tossed him into prison for a time and confiscated his property. He claimed contacts with high-ranking Iranian officials, but the CIA decided he couldn't be trusted after he failed polygraph tests -- though Mr. Ledeen quotes former CIA chief William Casey saying Mr. Ghorbanifar &quot;may be a con man's con man, but maybe he'll be our con man.&quot; In fact, Mr. Ghorbanifar would later help free several hostages, and serve as a key intermediary in France's recent normalization of relations with Iran.    Mr. Ghorbanifar first proposed the U.S. sell 500 TOW missiles to Iran in exchange for an end to terrorism and a release of hostages. Mr. Ledeen thought the possible rewards outweighed the risks. He applauds President Reagan for approving this first play in &quot;a complicated game that might lead either to an improvement in the relationship between the United States and Iran, or to a strengthening of pro-Western forces inside Iran.&quot;    Mr. Ledeen says bureaucratic in-fighting squeezed him out of the Iran-initiative team after The Rev. Benjamin Weir was freed. He regrets there was never any serious assessment of the key questions, which he identifies as: &quot;Is evolutionary change in Iran possible?&quot; and &quot;Are there legitimate channels to pro-Western Iranians who are loyal to the revolution, but in opposition to its more extreme policies?&quot; Without answers, even Mr. Ghorbanifar warned that &quot;we shall all become hostages to the hostages.&quot;    There was an economic incentive to rush ahead with the arms deals; to get money that could be diverted to the Contras in Nicaragua. Here, the key issue for Mr. Ledeen is not alleged illegalities, but the administration's political weakness in &quot;going behind the backs of congressmen and senators to organize secret support for the Contras rather than confronting the issues openly.&quot; An up-or-down vote might have lost, but &quot;would have left no doubt about congressional responsibility for the outcome.&quot;    This also would have saved Oliver North a lot of grief. Mr. Ledeen worked closely with Lt. Col. North on several projects, including the capture of the Achille Lauro terrorists. He describes Lt. Col. North as a &quot;masterful bureaucratic warrior,&quot; but one who always tried to &quot;get as close to the edge as possible, and run the greatest risk so that the thrill of survival be as intense as can be.&quot; This may be harsh. There is a good case that Lt. Col. North's activities were legal, and he did keep the Contras going as Congress fiddled with Boland amendments.    The congressional investigation failed because its primary mission was to bring down or paralyze President Reagan, with the secondary goal of expanding congressional control over foreign policy. Congress might have served itself and the country better, Mr. Ledeen suggests, by invoking Talleyrand's comment on Napoleon's assassination of a duke, &quot;It is worse than a crime, it is a mistake.&quot; Mr. Ledeen points out that despite all the attention lavished on the Iran-Contra affair, no one can say precisely what U.S. strategy is or should be toward either Iran or Nicaragua.    Mr. Ledeen also wipes off some of the mud hurled at him, including a baseless charge by Sen. William Cohen during the hearings that Mr. Ledeen had profited from the arms sales. Mr. Ledeen, who notes that even Joe McCarthy guaranteed that anyone defamed by his committee could testify, underscores the highly legalistic approach of Congress by dedicating this book to his lawyer, James Woolsey.    Congress was wrong to criminalize its differences with the executive branch. But Mr. Ledeen also blames the White House for failing to &quot;protect the institutional and constitutional interests of the presidency.&quot; The refusal to insist on presidential prerogatives or to protect officials from frivolous indictments will further reduce the executive discretion necessary to run a sensible foreign policy. This will, of course, make future Iran-Contra affairs more likely, not less.    ---   Mr. Crovitz is assistant editor of the Journal's editorial page. </TEXT></DOC>
