At Sungkyunkwang and Konkuk universities in Seoul, hundreds ofriot police fired tear gas to block anti-government students frommarching into the streets. No arrests or injuries were reported.   In the southern city of Chinju, press reports said a passengertrain was caught in a clash between police and about 1,200 students.   The Korean news agency Yonhap said most passengers escapedunhurt, but that a student barrage of firebombs and rocks shatteredat least 300 train windows and destroyed some seats.   The violence at Chinju followed an anti-government rally atnearby Kyongsang University, where students were protesting weekendpolice action.   Students said dozens of people were hurt Saturday when policefiring tear gas stormed the Kyongsang campus to disperse about3,000 students and workers demanding a freer labor movement and aboycott of agricultural imports.   About 1,200 students from Hankook University occupied a road inSeoul's southern shopping center Monday after boycotting a one-weekperiod of obligatory military training at army barracks.   They cried, ``Down with the military dictatorship that forces usto take mercenary training for Yankees!''   The students denounced the government of President Roh Tae-wooas a dictatorship.   They also shouted slogans such as ``Drive out American economicaggressors!'' They said the Roh government allows such``aggression'' by accepting U.S. demands to open South Koreanmarkets.   Violent campus demonstrations increased steeply in recent weeksdespite democratic reforms proposed by the government. Studentshave called for full democracy, but government officials say recentprotests were organized by leftists trying to overthrow thegovernment by force.   Roh, who succeeded Chun Doo-hwan as president in February,pledged to end authoritarian rule but at the same time called forstern punishment of violent protests to ensure stability.</TEXT></DOC>
