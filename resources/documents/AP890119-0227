The formula of politicalpluralism should reflect differentiation and multitude of interestsand political orientations as well as beliefs of particular socialgroups and circles, be conducive to solving contradictions anddisputes with no harm to the supreme values of the nation and lawabidingly _ within state structures and not against them.   The Central Committee confirms the readiness of the Polish UnitedWorkers Party (the Communist party) to conduct dialogue and searchfor forms of agreement with any constructive political force if thelatter _ irrespective of political orientation and ideologicalinspiration _ observes the country's constitutional order andregards the ... prosperous future of the nation and the state as thesupreme value.   To promote these principles and values, it is possible andnecessary to cooperate in materializing the tasks that unite, ratherthan divide, society and serve well the solving of Polishcivilizational and economic problems.   The ... Central Committee sees the need and the possibility toinclude constructive opposition in the political system.   The ... Central Committee comes out for strong and independenttrade union movement. ... We base our attitude towards the principleof trade union pluralism on the assumption that ``the trade unionswill be such as the working people wish them to be.''   While taking into account the progress made in the sphere ofpolitical dialogue and democratization of life in Poland as well asthe requirements of the country's development, the Central Committeecomes out in favor of lifting _ in conditions of national agreement_ of restrictions on creating new trade unions, provided that thenew unions:   Abide by the constitutional and legislative order and trade unionstatutes.   Act in favor of economic development, while being aware thatproduction of goods is the condition for distribution.   Rely on financial sources in tune with the law in force in Polandand the principle of loyalty to their own state.   Counteract attempts to violate social peace or to undermine thestability of the state.   The organizational shape of trade unions is an open question. Itrequires discussion by all sides concerned.   It is also at the round table that conditions, ways and timetableshould be agreed concerning the introduction of trade unionpluralism and opening up the way to creating new trade unions,including ``Solidarity,'' which in the name of unity of interests ofthe working world would set up a joint representation vis-a-vis theeconomic administration in work establishments.   The Central Committee calls on all Polish United Workers Partymembers and candidate members to actively support this stand.</TEXT></DOC>
