Theoriginal seismic data used in the study were acquired on a heavy oillease from the Marguerite Lake stimulation project. This pilot projecthas operated for several years and provided an excellent opportunityto evaluate the effectiveness using seismic techniques to measure movementof the stimulation front. Seismic surveys were conducted in successiveyears to determine whether observable changes could be recognized withinthe reservoir units. Data from this 3-D grid were reprocessed from fieldtapes to enhance the frequency content necessary for inversion. The resultsof this study indicate that quantitative data can be obtained that relatedirectly to the stimulation of the reservoir units. This paper discussesthe factors that influence the ability of seismic data to measure stimulationeffects. These factors include reservoir parameters, stimulation techniques,acquisition parameters, seismic processing, and quantification of theresults using inversion (Seislog). Specific examples of data from theMarguerite Lake pilot project are used as illustration. 7 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
