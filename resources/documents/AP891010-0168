PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Leaders of a political movement in the southernrepublic of Azerbaijan suspended on Tuesday a rail strike thatchoked off supplies of fuel, food and housing supplies toneighboring Armenia, a member said.   ``We decided in a directive to open the railroad to Armenia asof 22:00 (10 p.m.),'' said Ingilap Aslanov, a member of thegrass-roots People's Front and of the group's strike committee, ina telephone interview from the Azerbaijani capital Baku.   He said the strike was suspended until Oct. 23 to give Sovietlegislators in Moscow a chance to respond to Azerbaijan's demandsto remove special Kremlin administration of the Nagorno-Karabakharea _ the source of a bloody ethnic dispute between Azerbaijanisand Armenians.   Soviet troops moved into the Caucasus republics last week tobreak the blockade that has been strangling Armenia and thedisputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh. About 400 trains with60,000 cars were reported idled.   Official news media said Tuesday that in the previous 24 hoursauthorities managed to push 1,748 carloads of supplies through toArmenia.   But Deputy Premier Lev Voronin told the Supreme Sovietlegislature that did not include oil products. A fuel shortage hasstranded ambulances and halted harvesting in Armenia's fields.   Reports said freight arriving in Armenia under military guardwas damaged.   Aslanov said the Azerbaijan People's Front wanted the issue ofNagorno-Karabakh taken up by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet,the country's highest-ranking executive body, but settled fordemanding that the Supreme Soviet legislature review the question.   If it does not do so by Oct. 23, the People's Front will call ageneral strike that once again will include the railroads, he said.   The People's Front leadership made the decision after thousandsof people gathered Sunday on the main square of Baku, he said.   The People's Front says the rail strike started Sept. 4, butArmenian officials say the flow of goods by rail through Azerbaijandried up almost three months ago.   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, opening the fall session of theSupreme Soviet on Sept. 25, called for firm steps to break thetransportation deadlock.   After hearing Tuesday from Voronin, the Supreme Soviet onceagain called on Armenia and Azerbaijan to end their dispute.   Voronin said ``blown-up bridges and continuing strafing oftrains'' still makes transport difficult in Armenia and Azerbaijan.   Armenians and Azerbaijanis have engaged in ethnic violence for19 months, largely over Nagorno-Karabakh. Armenians want control ofthe area, a section of Azerbaijan where most inhabitants areArmenian. Azerbaijan wants to retain control, and seeks an end tothe special administration from Moscow that was imposed in Januaryin an effort to calm the situation.   The Communist Party newspaper Pravda said Tuesday thatfactory-built temporary houses for victims of last December'sArmenian earthquake were smashed into piles of metal, broken glassand crushed window frames during transit.   Prefurnished rooms for the earthquake reconstruction projectarrived with ovens, sinks, pipes and beds ruined, the newspapersaid.   ``They simply cannot be restored,'' Pravda said.   Tass said it is proving particularly hard to restore transportof supplies in Nagorno-Karabakh. The regions of Martuninski andGadrutski have been cut off since a bridge was blown up Saturday,the newspaper Red Star said Tuesday.   Krasnaya Zvezda also said weapons were found hidden in sacks offlour on an Armenian helicopter relief flight. The pilot denied anyknowledge of the weapons.</TEXT></DOC>
