The suspension will be effective until Nov. 30, when traderswill evaluate the progress made in adopting legislation modernizingthe stock market and simplifying a proposed capital gains tax.   The decision followed a meeting early Wednesday betweenrepresentatives of striking floor traders and members of theFinance Committee of the Chamber of Deputies.   Trading on Italy's 10 regional stock exchanges, which aredominated by the Milan bourse, is expected to resume Thursday.   The floor traders had called the strike to protest a newgovernment proposal for a 30 percent capital gains tax. They fearthat the way the government intends to collect the tax will scareinvestors away from the stock market and shift business to otherEuropean markets.   The government has said it is willing to consider technicalimprovements in the implementation of the law, but that it isn'twilling to renounce the capital gains tax itself.</TEXT></DOC>
