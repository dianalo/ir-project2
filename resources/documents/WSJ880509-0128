The Federal Home Loan Bank Board said commitments made in early April by real-estate lenders for conventional, fixed-rate mortgages carried an average effective rate of 10.48%, up from 10.33% in early March. In April 1987, the rate was 9.7%. Conventional mortgages aren't insured by the government.    Borrowing costs on fixed-rate home loans have crept higher in recent weeks. &quot;We believe that we could see an 11% level on fixed-rate mortgages by the end of the year,&quot; said Warren Lasko, executive vice president of the Mortgage Bankers Association of America.    Meanwhile, rates on adjustable-rate mortgages slid slightly in April to an average initial rate of 8.62% from 8.64% a month earlier, the Bank Board said. It was the first time in six months that the difference in interest rates between fixed and adjustable mortgages has widened.    Many home buyers have been trying to lock in relatively favorable rates for fixed-rate mortgages ahead of anticipated rate increases later this year. This demand accounts for much of the fixed-rate increase as well as the small slide in adjustable rates. Mr. Lasko said he expected prospective home buyers to jump into the market now to beat potentially higher rates.    The Bank Board's interest rates apply to mortgages maturing in 15 years or more, and include points paid by the buyer.    The board also reported that the average price of a new home in April was $147,000, essentially unchanged from a month earlier.    Separately, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. said the average rate for 30-year, conventional, fixed-rate mortgages rose slightly to 10.32% for the week ended Friday from 10.28% the week before. The rates apply to 30-year loans with down payments of 20% and don't include fees, points or private mortgage-insurance premiums. </TEXT></DOC>
