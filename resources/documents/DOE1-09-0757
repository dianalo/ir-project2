The results for both D {le}4 and D = 5 + 6, presentedin BS, 1983a, show some decrease of cluster density with latitude. Thisdependence is corrected for in the determination of the cluster correlationfunction by including the same selection effect, P(b), in the randomcatalogs. The frequency distribution, F(r), of all pairs of clusterswith separation, r, in the present sample was determined. Cluster separationswere calculated using the redshift distances and the angular separationon the sky {i.e., r = (R/sub 1//sup 2/+R/sub 2//sup 2/-2R/sub 1/R/sub2/cos{theta}/sup 1/2/}; peculiar velocities were assumed to be small.In order to minimize the influence of selection effects on the determinationof {xi}r), the author constructed a set of 1000 random catalogs, eachcontaining 104 clusters randomly distributed within the angular boundariesof the survey region, but with the same selection functions in both redshiftand angular position as the Abell redshift sample. The frequency distributionof cluster pairs was determined in both the real and random catalogsand the results were compared. This procedure ensures that the selectioneffects and boundary conditions will affect the data and random catalogsin the same manner, thus minimizing most of these effects.</TEXT></DOC>
