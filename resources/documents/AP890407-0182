DALE NELSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Former President Reagan and top officials ofhis administration were more deeply involved than previouslydisclosed in efforts to encourage other countries to aidNicaragua's Contra rebels, new trial evidence shows.   A statement of facts introduced in Oliver L. North's trial onThursday _ in a document agreed to by the government _ indicatedReagan, former Secretary of State George Shultz and formerSecretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger played key roles inproviding inducements for such aid.   The three-member Tower Commission, appointed by Reagan toinvestigate the Iran-Contra affair, said in its Feb. 26, 1987,report that it had found ``no evidence to suggest that thepresident was aware'' of North's activities in the 1984-86 periodon behalf of the rebels opposing the Nicaraguan government.   Direct government assistance by the United States was prohibitedby law at the time.   The statement of facts says that in mid-August 1984, one ofNorth's superiors, then-Deputy National Security Adviser JohnPoindexter, discussed with Reagan and others a proposal ascribed toShultz that would allow Congress to ``wink'' at lethal support forthe resistance.   Under the plan, the document says, the United States ``wouldprovide military aid to El Salvador, which in turn would providelethal aid to the resistance.''   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, who was amember of the Senate's Iran-Contra committee, said Thursday thatsuch an arrangement would be ``clearly inappropriate, possiblyillegal.''   Shultz testified at the Iran-Contra hearings that in seeking aidfor the Contras, ``it seemed to me not a particularly good idea togo to countries with which we had a big military or economicassistance relationship because it could easily be misinterpreted.''   The new document says that on Feb. 19, 1985, National SecurityAdviser Robert McFarlane sent a memorandum to Reagan about arecommendation to provide incentives to Honduras to aid the Contras.   ``The memorandum described each of the agreed-upon incentives,''according to the statement of facts. ``President Reagan personallyauthorized the entire plan.''   Later in February, it says, McFarlane asked Weinberger to``commence expedited delivery of military items, as previouslyplanned and personally authorized by President Reagan,'' toHonduras.   In testimony before the congressional panels, Weinberger wasasked what steps his department had taken to comply with thecongressional cutoff of U.S. military aid to the rebels. Hereplied, ``Well, we issued ... any instructions that were requiredby the new law. But we didn't have any activities there. So weweren't really monitoring anything that wasn't happening.''   Reagan's spokesman, Mark Weinberg, declined comment Friday onthe revelations. ``This is a pending legal matter and we do notcomment on developments in this trial,'' Weinberg said by telephonefrom Los Angeles.   Neither Shultz nor Weinberger immediately returned telephonecalls placed to their offices. Weinberger is with a Washington lawfirm and Shultz is on the faculty at Stanford University in PaloAlto, Calif.   The statement of facts also quoted the late CIA Director WilliamCasey as saying at a meeting with CIA and State Departmentofficials in mid-July of 1984 that ``those present ought to getmoving'' on obtaining funds for the Contras from sources other thanthe U.S. government.   It goes on to quote Casey as saying in that meeting that WilliamFrench Smith, then attorney general, ``had recently concluded thatraising the funds in this manner would not be an impeachableoffense.'' The statement says the possibility of impeachment hadbeen raised at a meeting of a national security planning group onJune 25, 1984.   Smith said by telephone from Los Angeles, ``I don't rememberever being involved in any conversation where there was any serioustalk of impeachment.'   ``At that time, nothing had happened, so I don't know whyanybody would be talking about impeachment at that point,'' hesaid. ``When I say nothing had happened, I mean nothing hadhappened that anybody knew about.''   President Bush, at a news conference Friday, declined to discussthe document introduced at the trial, and said that all of theinformation in it had been provided to the Tower Commission andcongressional investigators.   Neither former Sen. John G. Tower, R-Texas, chairman of thecommission, nor former Secretary of State Edmund Muskie, itsDemocratic member, immediately returned telephone calls to theiroffices seeking comment.   The third member of the commission, Brent Scowcroft, is nowBush's national security adviser. A telephone call to him wasreferred to his spokemsan, Roman Popadiuk, who also did notimmediately return a call.   Sarah Binder, press secretary to Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind.,chairman of the House Iran-Contra committee, said Hamilton wouldhave no comment until he had studied the document. Gregg Takayama,spokesman for Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, chairmana of the Senatepanel, said the senator ``has not wanted to comment on the evidencethat has come out at the trial.''</TEXT></DOC>
