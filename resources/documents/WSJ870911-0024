The increase, five times the rate of growth in the non-Hispanic population in the same period, means that Hispanics account for 7.9% of the total U.S. population, up from 6.4% in 1980. The report also shows that, while levels of education and employment among Hispanics have increased, the poverty rate has remained about the same.    Part of the population increase reflects the first use of census procedures changed to account for undocumented immigrants, officials said. The new procedures also account for emigrants from the U.S.    The proportion of Hispanics 25 years old and over who had at least a high school degree increased to 50.9% in 1987 from 45.4% in 1982. Unemployment rates among Hispanics 16 years old and over declined to 10.2% from 13.4%. However, the percentage of Hispanic families living below the poverty level increased to 24.7% in 1987 from 23.5% in 1982.    In this survey, the poverty level was defined as income of $11,230 or less for a family of four. All these percentages and rates of change were less favorable than for non-Hispanics. </TEXT></DOC>
