The current Sejm, or parliament, has only one chamber, and in thepast only approved candidates were placed on the ballot by theCommunist Party or its two allied parties working through aparty-dominated electoral commission.   The voter had the option of crossing out candidates on theballot, but write-in candidates were not allowed, and independentgroups could not field their own candidates for parliament.   The newly created senate was agreed upon by government andopposition negotiators of a working group on political reform thatforms part of larger ``round-table'' negotiations on Poland's future.   Negotiators must still work out details of the electoral law. Butin general, anyone nominated by an existing social or politicalgroup or who gathered an as yet undetermined number of signaturescould run on the ballot in the first round of two-stage elections,negotiators said.   The government side has proposed that 5,000 signatures berequired to nominate a candidate. The opposition is likely to pressfor a smaller number.   Before, voters theoretically had a choice among differentcandidates. But a majority of the seats were contested only byCommunist candidates, guaranteeing that no matter which individualswon the races, the Communists would gain the majority.   A certain negotiated minority of seats would be given in the samemanner to the Communist-allied Peasants Party and Democratic Party,plus a handful of seats to independents or members of certainsemi-independent organizations, such as the Polish Catholic SocialUnion.   Until last year's local elections, the party's preferredcandidate in any race was listed at the top of the ballot, and anyunmarked ballots were credited automatically to that candidate. Aparty loyalist never needed even to look at the ballot beforevoting, merely to drop it blank into the box.   Unlike the current system in which each party receives apre-allocated number of seats, the balance of power in the newsenate would be determined solely by the voters. Party Politburomember Janusz Reykowski said there would be no attempt to arrangeits composition beforehand.   In addition, negotiators agreed that opposition would be free torun for at least 35 percent of the seats to the Sejm, which willremain the most powerful parliament chamber.   Sixty-five percent of the Sejm seats would only be contested bythe Communist Party and its allies.   Although the new senate elections will be free for the firsttime, some opposition activists have cautioned that the CommunistParty will still have important advantages.   For example, no opposition political parties exist legally inPoland, independent groups here have no experience in mountingelectoral campaigns, and the amount of media exposure that thestate-controlled press and television will give oppositioncandidates is still unresolved.   Finally, authorities have insisted on elections in June, leavingthe independents little time to mount effective campaigns.</TEXT></DOC>
