Federal Election Commissioner S.A. Nusrat said on television thatIshaq Khan swept 78 percent of the presidential vote.   Of 446 valid votes, Ishaq Khan polled 348 compared with 91 to hisnearest rival, veteran politican Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan, Nusratsaid.   Ms. Bhutto won her first test of strength in the NationalAssembly, the country's lower house of parliament.   Of 203 members voting on the confidence motion, 148 said ``yes''and 55 said ``no.''   Her Pakistan People's Party party emerged as the largest singleparty Nov. 16 in the country's first free elections in more than adecade. But with 105 seats, it fell short of an outright majority inthe 237-seat legislature. The party since gained support fromseveral independents and minor parties.   The constitution dictates that the governing party pass aparliamentary test of confidence within 60 days of forming agovernment.   The Senate, National Assembly and four provincial assembliesfunctioned as an electoral college for the president.   Provincial assemblies were restricted to 45 votes each to putthem on equal footing. The populous eastern Punjab assembly has 260members, for example, compared to western Baluchistan's 45legislators.   Of the four presidential candidates, only Ishaq Khan, 73, of theconservative Pakistan Muslim League, had the support both of Ms.Bhutto's party and the right-wing opposition alliance, headed by theMuslim League.   Ishaq Khan has been credited with guiding Pakistan back todemocracy after 11 years of autocratic rule, eight of them undermartial law by President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq.   Zia died in an Aug. 17 plane crash investigators said wasprobably caused by sabotage.   Because he was Senate chairman, the presidency was passed toIshaq Khan, a venerable technocrat and constitutional scholar withnearly 40 years' experience in senior administrative posts, six ofthem as finance and commerce minister.   Pakistan's president holds a largely ceremonial post, but theroles of both president and prime minister are under debate here.   A 1985 constitutional amendment authored by Zia gave thepresident broad but vague discretionary powers.   Ms. Bhutto has called for a repeal of that amendment, which wouldrestore supreme political powers to the prime minister as theyexisted during her father's government of the 1970s.   Zia ousted Ms. Bhutto's father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, in 1977. Hehad Bhutto executed two years later allegedly for plotting tooverthrow a political foe.</TEXT></DOC>
