Gosman family, which holds a 9.8% stake in the bank, with violating various securities and banking laws.    Named as defendants are Mr. Gosman, a Massachusetts investor, his sons Michael and Andrew Gosman, and the two companies they control. The group has said it plans to increase its Northeast holdings, and last week received Federal Home Loan Bank Board approval to boost its stake to as much as 35%.    In response to the lawsuit Abraham Gosman said: &quot;I think everyone would be best served if they would focus their attention on the day-to-day operations of the bank instead of concerning themselves with whether an individual like myself wants to increase his holdings in it.&quot;    Northeast said it intends to petition the Bank Board to reconsider its approval of the Gosman group's application to increase its stake, and plans to appeal the board's decision in court.    As previously reported, four shareholders filed a class action lawsuit against Northeast in a Massachusetts court last week, challenging an anti-takeover plan that the board adopted in October. Mr. Gosman said his group isn't involved in that lawsuit, but said &quot;if management does not rescind the 'poison pill' we intend to litigate it on the issue.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
