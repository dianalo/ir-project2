(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Xerox Corp. will eliminate 800 managerialand professional jobs from its U.S. Marketing Group, but expects tobe able to shift displaced employees to other positions in thegroup, a company spokesman said.   The job cuts are being made only in areas that do not havedirect contact with customers, such as public relations, said Xeroxspokesman John Rasor.   The cutback is part of a companywide effort to reduce expensesand then invest in areas that directly serve the customer, Rasorsaid.   Workers whose jobs are eliminated will initially fill jobs nowavailable because of a hiring freeze that has been in effectthroughout the group, which sells and services the company'scopiers.   A. Barry Rand, the group's president, said Tuesday that layoffswould be a last resort and that no one who takes another job withthe company will take a pay cut.   The U.S. Marketing Group, headquartered in Rochester, employsabout 2,600 people here, and about 27,500 throughout the UnitedStates. The cutback will affect 675 jobs in Rochester and 125 atother locations, Rasor said.</TEXT></DOC>
