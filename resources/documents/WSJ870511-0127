Higgins</HL><DD> 05/11/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><TEXT>   When I first previewed the initial episode of Fox Broadcasting Co.'s &quot;Mr. President&quot; (it aired May 3), I concluded that this illustrious company had taken collective leave of its senses. The show was produced by Johnny Carson's company, which prepares and sells his and David Letterman's nightly entries to NBC, and also did such things as the theatrical movie, &quot;The Big Chill.&quot; The, ah, concept was Ed Weinberger's (&quot;Taxi,&quot;&quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;). The executive producer is Gene Reynolds (&quot;MASH,&quot; &quot;Lou Grant&quot;).    The male lead is George C. Scott, first seen on presidential election night in his home as Wisconsin Gov. Sam Tresch. He is surrounded by members of his loving family, none of whom appear to be carrying a full load of bricks. The early returns suggest that Tresch is either winning or losing, which sets the stage for some badinage between Tresch and staff members. We know these exchanges are supposed to be funny because Carson Productions has thoughtfully provided a laugh track. We know Mr. Carson's co-adjutors were not confident of that funniness, because they provided the laugh track. Mr. Carson's people were right.    Mr. Scott is 59 years old and has a &quot;curriculum vitae&quot; of thespian work that would stagger a Clydesdale. Yet he was modest in his appearance at the April 27 news conference on the Paramount Studio's set of the Oval Office: &quot;Well, I was out of a job and looking for work.&quot;    He had much to be modest about. The premiere featured him abusing aides, and marching through the White House in his cutaway and shorts in search of his wife (Carlin Glynn). Every so often he growled. The temptation is to say that comedy is not Mr. Scott's metier, but that would not be fair because this is not comedy. This is bad writing.    At the news conference, Mr. Carson objected to a reporter's use of the word &quot;sitcom&quot;: &quot;To me the word 'sitcom' means a jokey type of thing. This, if anything, is probably more of a drama with humor and comedy in it.&quot; Balderdash. This is a sitcom, and not a very good one, either. When Sam Tresch's opponent for the White House concedes defeat, he sings to his supporters several lines of Bob Hope's theme: &quot;Thanks for the Memories,&quot; on national television.    At the news conference, a reporter noted a &quot;certain irony that your company is selling a half-hour show to the network that put on Joan Rivers as its first offering. Do you see the irony in that?&quot; Mr. Carson said: &quot;I felt I owed Mr. Diller {Barry Diller of Fox Broadcasting} one.&quot;    Mr. Carson's even.    ---   Until the Miami Herald on the morning of May 3 published the best news that the Rev. Jim and Tammy Bakker had heard in a long time, I thought &quot;Mr. President&quot; was the most preposterous piece of buncombe I had seen in a long time. But then came the onslaught of news about Gary Hart, which bumped Jim and Tammy off the front pages and the evening news, and back into their Palm Springs home. And things looked somewhat different.    Television stations in Los Angeles, where I was when the Hart story broke, had a certain advantage over East Coast stations, reporting the rapid-fire, back-and-forth allegations about Mr. Hart's alleged hanky-panky. So did the West Coast newspapers. But the East Coast media seemed to be holding their own nicely when I got back home to Boston. Jeff Greenfield, on ABC's &quot;Nightline&quot; Monday, was on top of developments, suggesting that Mr. Hart take a positive approach, seeking electoral advantage by appealing to voters who have ever cheated on their spouses. Mr. Greenfield predicted a landslide plurality. I wondered whether that approach would work well in Iowa, where the first caucuses will be held next year, but I did admire Mr. Greenfield's wit.    All of the commentators whom I saw -- among them Hal Bruno on &quot;Nightline&quot; and John Chancellor on the NBC &quot;Nightly News&quot; -- justly stressed the fact that Mr. Hart's weekends with Donna Rice, whether chaste or steamy, displayed remarkably poor judgment on his part. Most pointed out correctly that extramarital ventures 20 years ago would not have made the news. Several raised the issue of whether a public figure's sexual adventures have any relevance to his or her qualifications for office. Geraldine Ferraro said on &quot;Nightline&quot; that the media revelations about this 50-year-old married man's Bimini idyll with a 29-year-old actress obscured his rectitude on, among other things, Women's Issues! Eleanor Smeal: Call your office at NOW.    None of the secular homilists I saw drew a parallel between Mr. Hart's behavior and that of Rev. Bakker. It seems to me that the issue overlooked here is that of apparent hypocrisy. Mr. Hart did not chivalrously duck the issue of whether he fools around. He challenged the press to prove it. Rev. Bakker regularly denounced sexual permissiveness, and was caught in its practice.    Johnny Carson made a good deal of fun of Mr. Hart on his show last Tuesday night, as had Mr. Carson's employee, David Letterman, early on the morning of that day. Mr. Hart richly deserved it. So, as well, do Mr. Carson and Mr. Scott deserve a loud and prolonged raspberry for &quot;Mr. President.&quot; On reflection, it's not a sitcom. It's just a plain old stinker. </TEXT></DOC>
