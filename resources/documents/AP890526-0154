The deportees said growing resistance to an assimilationcampaign in Bulgaria led to the violence. The campaign includesforcing ethnic Turks to change their Moslem names to Slavic ones.   ``At least 30 are dead, 200 seriously injured and about 2,000have been arrested,'' said Tahsin Haliloglu, one of 167 deportedethnic Turks who arrived in Ankara. Officials said 90 otherdeportees will arrive soon.   Haliloglu said he was an organizer of the weekend demonstrations.   ``We want our names back, education in Turkish in schools andthe right to carry on our traditions and our religious worshipwhich are all forbidden now,'' said Ali Ormanli, another deportee.   Ormanli had been participating in a hunger strike in Bulgaria.He said such strikes were spreading across Bulgaria.   Ormanli said he was sent to a concentration camp in 1985 andstayed there for two years and 10 months. After his release, hesaid he was exiled to another part of Bulgaria. He said he wasdeported May 9 without seeing his family.   ``All this was because I refused to change my name,'' Ormanlisaid in an interview at the airport.   About 300 people from emigre communities in Turkey greeted thedeportees. There were tearful reunions as some people found familymembers.   Premier Turgut Ozal also went to the airport and said Turkeywill ask all countries that signed a Helsinki agreement on humanrights in January to pressure Bulgaria to change its policies onits 900,000 ethnic Turks.   After the start of the campaign, Turkey asked Bulgaria fornegotiations and said it was willing to accept the entire Turkishminority.</TEXT></DOC>
