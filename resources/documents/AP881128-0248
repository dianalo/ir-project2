If they're right, the finding could revolutionize the treatmentof mental illness. Difficult and expensive psychotherapy could bereplaced with new drugs that would compensate for the genetic defect.   However, some geneticists say Dr. David Comings of the City ofHope National Medical Center and his wife, Brenda, are guilty of acolossal mistake or careless misuse of science.   An angry debate over their work erupted recently at the annualmeeting of the American Society of Human Genetics where DavidComings, president of the society this year, used his presidentialaddress to defend his findings.   He detailed a long list of behavioral disorders that he saidoccurred with unusually high frequency in the relatives of peoplewith Tourette syndrome.   David Pauls of Yale University presented similar research thatdirectly contradicted the Comings' findings. Pauls and hiscolleagues found no unusually high incidence of other disorders infamilies with Tourette syndrome.   After Pauls presented his data and responded to criticalquestions from David Comings, geneticists lingered to continue thediscussion.   ``I disagree with you completely,'' Dr. Arno Motulsky, professorof medicine and genetics at the University of Washington, told theComingses. ``You make these grandiose schemes without evidence.''   In Motulsky's view, that's a misuse of scientific data _ makinghypotheses that can't be supported by the facts.   ``You revolutionize genetics if it's true _ but I think it's veryunlikely,'' he said. David Comings was visibly hurt by thecriticism; Motulsky had been his teacher.   ``I think you are making claims that harken back to the earlydays of genetics... I think you're doing genetics a disservice,''Motulsky continued, referring to the early 20th century, whenlaziness, prostitution and criminality were said to be the result ofbad genes.   The implication was that it was a good idea to sterilize suchpeople, thereby ridding the population of undesirable traits, saysDaniel J. Kevles, a historian at the California Institute ofTechnology and author of ``In the Name of Eugenics: Genetics and theUses of Human Heredity.''   Making such generalizations has led to wildly erroneous anddamaging misuse of science in the past and could easily do so again,Kevles said. He said he hadn't read the Comingses' report andcouldn't comment on it directly.   Not everyone at the genetics meeting was critical of theComingses' work. Some praised the pair for their courage inproposing such a daring hypothesis.   Dr. Victor McKusick of Johns Hopkins University, a medicalgeneticist who has done extensive family studies with the Amish inPennsylvania, said, ``I lean toward the view that David Comings iscloser to the truth. He's a perceptive person.''   Dr. David Rimoin, director of medical genetics at the Universityof California, Los Angeles, noted that even if the Tourette gene isresponsible for some cases of mania, hyperactivity and compulsivebehavior it is not likely to be the cause of all cases of thosedisorders.   ``Many different causes can produce the same disease traits,''and a single disorder _ such as Tourette _ can show itself in manyways, ``so I'm not surprised'' by the Comings findings, Rimoin said.   Even the Comingses' most ferocious critics accused them of noworse offense than shoddy science; there was no suggestion ofdeliberate distortion.   The Comingses based their conclusions on extensive studies offamilies of patients with Tourette syndrome, an inherited disordermarked by jerky movements, or tics, and uncontrollable vocalmannerisms including grunts, yelps, barks and sometimes involuntaryoutbursts of profanity.   The syndrome had been thought rare, occurring in at least one in2,000 Americans, but David Comings said in an interview he believesit occurs in as many as 1 in 200 _ or about 1 million _ Americans,usually becoming evident in the young, more often in boys than ingirls.   In a 166-page report in the American Journal of Human Genetics,the Comingses said that attention-deficit disorder, with or withouthyperactivity, is 10 times more common in Tourette families than inthe general population. Obsessive-compulsive behavior is five timesas common. Conduct disorders, 17 times as common. Stuttering, fivetimes. Dyslexia, six times. Panic attacks, 13 times. Multiplephobias, three times. Depression, 11 times. Mania and severeanxiety, 20 times as common.   At the genetics meeting, Comings added alcoholism, compulsiveovereating and drug abuse. Other associated symptoms includeauditory hallucinations, short temper, exhibition and easiness toanger.   All of these disorders are manifestations of theyet-to-be-discovered gene that causes Tourette syndrome, the coupleasserted.   They explain the findings by suggesting that the gene isassociated with a biochemical loss of inhibitions. ``Many of thefeatures of (Tourette syndrome) can be visualized as disinhibited,active, intrusive symptoms...,'' they wrote.   David and Brenda Comings say Pauls doesn't see the connectionsbecause, unlike them, he doesn't treat patients with Tourettesyndrome. Pauls is a geneticist, not a psychologist.   Pauls says his studies included interviews with many relatives ofTourette syndrome patients, while many of the Comingses' studieswere based on interviews with only patients and their parents.   ``Our (finding) is based on direct interview information,'' Paulssaid. ``Theirs is based more on clinical impression.''   In a lengthy letter in the American Journal of Human Generics,Pauls and his Yale colleagues exhaustively criticized the Comingses'findings.   They said the weaknesses in their research ``make it impossibleto accept as valid any of the results presented...'' That's stronglanguage for an exchange in a scientific journal.   ``One of our major criticisms of Comings is that he confusessymptoms with diagnosis,'' said Kenneth Kidd, one of the Yaleresearchers. ``Tourette syndrome patients have symptoms ofobsessive-compulsive disorder but do not have the disorder...Different disorders can have symptoms in common.''   Sue Levi, past president of the Tourette Syndrome Association inNew York City, said the Comingses' findings have created confusionamong patients. ``Our organization was contacted by people who haveproblems with substance abuse, problems with obesity, problems withanorexia'' who suddenly thought they might be carriers of theTourette syndrome gene, Levi said.   ``We had to be even-handed about saying the jury is out,'' shesaid.   The jury may not be out for long. The association is spending$200,000 this year to enable six laboratories in the United Statesand Europe to search for the Tourette syndrome gene, or a geneticmarker that will indicate its approximate location on humanchromosomes.   Once such a marker is found, researchers will be able to directlytest the Comingses' hypothesis. That could happen within the nextfew years or the next few months, Levi said.   Despite their differences, David and Brenda Comings and the Yalegroup agree on one thing: Resolution of the controversy will benefitpatients.   ``The progress of science often involves debate and argument overdata that don't agree, trying to find out why they don't agree,''said Kidd.   ``In the best sense, this controversy can help the broaderscientific community understand what is different about the twogroups. Maybe some third party will gain some insight that neitherof us has.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Dec. 1</NOTE></DOC>
