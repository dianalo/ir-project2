Compared withlast season, when the Titans won once in 14 league games, this season alreadycould be described as a success.;   &quot;Not just yet,&quot; said Crane, who is in histhird season of coaching the Titans. &quot;We have a long way to go. We're muchimproved over last season and we're getting better every week.&quot;;   Crane begancoaching while his two sons, now grown, were coming up through the ranks ofyouth sports.;   He coached a Fremont soccer team for 10 years and hasparticipated in softball and basketball leagues since he was 21. Soccer is theonly sport Crane has never played.;   &quot;When (Kennedy's Athletic Director) PeteMichaletos called me and asked if I'd be interested in coaching the soccerteam, it probably took me 30 seconds to make up my mind,&quot; Crane said. &quot;To saythe least, it's been a rewarding experience. I'm still a kid at heart.&quot;;  Crane, 48, a lifetime CHP officer, began his quest for law enforcement at age12.;   &quot;We lived near the CHP's old academy school in Elk Grove, just south ofSacramento,&quot; said Crane, who lives in Fremont. &quot;I used to ride my bike nearthe facility nearly every day and that's when I decided to become anofficer.&quot;;   Crane has been an officer since 1966, when he was assigned toroad enforcement. He is now stationed at the Mission Grade inspection facilityon I-680, much less hazardous duty than the only time Crane pulled out his gunwhile on duty.;   &quot;It turned out that the guy was not the person we werelooking for,&quot; Crane said. &quot;It was somewhat startling at the time thinkingabout what could have happened.&quot;;   Crane has taken graveyard shifts in thepast so he could help coach his sons in youth sports.;   &quot;It was always greatto be near my boys and all kids,&quot; Crane said.;   &quot;Even though I can't teachthe kids what I want them to do, in soccer I can get it across to them. Theyunderstand me and I understand them.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  PEDRO GOMEZ, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Alameda County/Am  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911225  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  December  </MONTH><PG.COL>  10  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  462  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday, December 25, 199100360259,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
