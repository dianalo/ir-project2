Nuclear medicineis no exception. In one sense, medical imaging modalities, such as plainfilm and contrast studies, computerized tomography (CT), ultrasound,digital subtraction angiography, conventional nuclear imaging, and PET,are competitive. They compete for space, funds, people, enthusiasm, andinterest. For example, in the 1970s the use of radionuclide brain scansdropped sharply in hospitals when CT became available; ultrasound andnuclear medicine studies of the biliary system led to a significant decreasein the use of oral cholecystograpy and intravenous cholangiography. Somepredict that nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and digital radiographymay have a significant impact on CT scanning by 1990, because currentNMR images are comparable in anatomic resolution to CT without bone artifactsand, especially important in the 1980s, without ionizing radiation. Inthe face of all this competition, the continued growth and well-beingof the field of nuclear medicine will depend on the degree to which thefield can adapt itself to the changing circumstances of medical practiceand research in the 1980s. The forces that will shape the future of nuclearmedicine will continue to come from both within and outside the field.</TEXT></DOC>
