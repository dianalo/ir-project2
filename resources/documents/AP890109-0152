But don't get too excited, it's only temporary.   Reagan proposed Census Bureau spending of $1.47 billion forfiscal 1990, up from about $250 million in 1988 and about $559million in the current year.   The reason is the ``decennial'' census.   The Constitution requires the bureau to count all residents ofthe United States every 10 years. The next count will be conductedApril 1, 1990.   That requires opening dozens of offices across the country,mailing out more than 100 million census forms, sending an army ofpeople to the thousands of homes where folks fail to respond, andcompiling the tidal wave of data to be collected.   Overall, the 1990 national head count is expected to cost $2.6billion, but not all in one year. The costs are spread over severalyears because of the lengthy preparation of forms and maps andoffices and computers.</TEXT></DOC>
