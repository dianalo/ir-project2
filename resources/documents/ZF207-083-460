Schindler Jr.andM;IBM took the latest steps toward fulfilling its SAA pledge last month,announcing two packages that, for the first time, bring OS/2's CUAspecification to mainframe environments.andM;IBM is readying new versions of its Interactive System Productivity Facility(ISPF) software for MVS and VM/SP operating systems that implement CommonUser Access (CUA), which defines the ''look and feel'' of applications,including the layout, the use of function keys and the appearance of screens,company officials said.andP;  Version 3 of the software will allow developers tocreate mainframe applications that, for example, include the same keystrokecombinations and look the same as OS/2 applications.andM;ISPF is a ''dialogue manager,'' which lets users create screens that can beaccessed by high-level languages, which then pass back user-entered data.andM;When IBM introduced Systems Application Architecture (SAA) in March 1987, itsblueprint for providing common communications, programming languages and userinterfaces among its diverse systems, it promised that all elements would beavailable on all four of its major operating-system platforms: OS/2, OS/400(for the AS/400 midrange computer), MVS and VM/SP.andP;  The Presentation Managerin OS/2 Extended Edition implements CUA, but IBM has yet to integrate theprotocol into OS/ 400.andM;IBM will implement only part of CUA -- pop-up windows, action bars,action-bar ''pulldowns,'' message area (location, appearance and content) andfunction-key locations -- into the ISPF releases, officials said.andP;  This useof CUA (as well as a new on-line help facility) will promote betterprogrammer and end-user productivity, officials claimed.andM;The new ISPF versions will allow users to use either CUA mode or ISPF modescreens, officials said.andM;The new releases make it possible for mainframe programmers to begin writingapplications that make use of both a dialogue manager and CUA -- the kind ofapplications IBM says users can someday write for OS/2 Extended Edition.andM;IBM plans to release the ISPF version 3 for MVS environments in May, followedby the VM/SP version in June.andP;  Pricing of the software depends on mainframeconfiguration.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
