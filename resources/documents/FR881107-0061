FDA's research program is described in the Catalog ofFederal Domestic Assistance, No. 13.103.<ITAG tagnum="84">I. Background</ITAG>The Office of Orphan Products Development was established to identify andfacilitate the availability of orphan products. Orphan products are drugs,biologics, medical devices (including in vitro diagnostics), and foodsfor medical purposes that meet the criteria of the Orphan Drug Act. Theseproducts may be useful in a rare disease/disorder, but most lack commercialsponsorship because they are not considered commercially attractive formarketing. A subcategory of orphan products are those marketed productsin which there is evidence suggesting usefulness in a rare disease/disorderbut which are not labeled for that disease/disorder because substantialevidence of safety and effectiveness for that use is lacking. One way to make orphan products more easily available is to support researchto determine whether the products are safe and effective. FDA has allowedfunds to support such research since fiscal year 1983. All funded studiesare subject to the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and CosmeticAct (the act) and regulations promulgated thereunder. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Research Goals And Objectives </ITAG>A. Clinical StudiesIn general, FDA will only consider awarding grants to support clinicalstudies for determining whether the products are safe and effective forpremarket approval under the act (21 U.S.C. 301 <T3>et seq.</T3>) or under section 351 of the Public Health Service Act(42 U.S.C. 262). These clinical studies may be designed to assist in theapproval of unapproved products or approval of unapproved new uses forproducts already marketed. Ordinarily, at least some preliminary clinical research suggesting effectivenessand relative safety should already be available. However, FDA will alsoconsider applications concerning products for which persuasive pharmacologicevidence is available showing that a product has a reasonable possibilityof being effective even though no clinical trials have yet been performed.Applications should be for one discrete clinical trial. The applicant mustprovide supporting evidence that the product to be investigated is availableto the applicant in the form needed for the clinical trial. The typical study that FDA will consider for support may involve up toseveral dozen subjects, will be well-controlled, and will be designed toprovide substantial evidence of the product's safety and effectiveness.Because funds are limited, FDA cannot consider large research projectsinvolving many subjects and long-term follow up. The agency will also consider funding pharmacokinetic studies if such studiesare necesary to determine safe and effective doses in subjects with seriousorgan disease that might affect drug disposition. However, FDA will considerpharmacokinetic studies only if they are parts of studies for determiningeffectiveness of a product or are proposed to obtain information aboutproducts about which there is already a significant amount of evidenceshowing effectiveness. FDA's standards for adequate and well-controlled studies (21 CFR 314.126)should be followed. In designing a well-controlled study, the investigatorshould especially keep in mind that historical controls or use of the subjectas his or her own control is generally less desirable and reliable thanactive control or, when ethical, placebo controls. The applicant's proposalshould provide a rationale for use of the control method chosen to satisfyconsideration of scientific quality and ethical realities. In addition to FDA's general interest in clinical studies for the safetyand effectiveness of orphan products, the agency has recognized the followingareas of pediatric research for which applications are encouraged.1. Studies on marketed drugs currently approved only for adult uses whichwould provide data to support approving these drugs for pediatric patients.2. Studies on nutritional products (medical foods) for management of inbornerrors of metabolism for which adequate therapies are not currently available.<T3>B. Significance</T3>Each investigator submitting a grant application for a proposed orphanuse in response to this request for applications should include a shortstatement explaining why preliminary evidence suggests that the productmeets the objectives of the orphan products development program and whythe product to be studied is an orphan product as described in the ``Background''section of this notice. This statement should appear in the applicationunder Section 2. B._``Background and Significance.''<T3>C. Statistical Support</T3>Statistical expertise is helpful in the planning, design, execution, andanalysis of clinical investigations and clinical pharmacology to ensurethe validity of estimates of safety and efficacy obtained from human studies.Applicants are expected to provide a statistical justification for thenumber of patients chosen for the trial based on the proposed outcome measures.Applicants should also document the appropriateness of the statisticalprocedures to be used in analysis of the results.<T3>D. Journal Reference</T3>Published reports are necessary and often critical for the review processand can help to support the investigator's research intent. Applicantsshould include copies of reprints of all relevant references for FDA review.This includes favorable and unfavorable reports.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Human Subject Protection And Informed Consent </ITAG><T3>A. Research Involving Human Subjects</T3>Applicants should carefully review the section on human subjects on pages4 and 5 of the instructions in the application kit. The Specific Instructions-Section1, Item 4, Human Subjects, on pages 12 and 13 of the application kit shouldalso be carefully reviewed for the certification of institutional reviewboard (IRB) approval requirements. Applicants must provide informationabout six items described in Section 2-E of the instructions in the applicationkit. These six items include: The characteristics of the subjects, thesources of research materials, recruitment plans and consent procedures,any potential risks, and potential benefits to the subjects. Failure toinclude this information may result in deferral of the application. Thegoal should be to include enough information in a sufficiently clear fashionso that reviewers will not have to delay action on the application.<T3>B. Informed Consent</T3>Consent and/or assent forms and any additional information to be givento a subject must accompany the Grant Application Form PHS 398 (Rev. 9/86).Failure to include this information may result in deferral of the application.Information that is given to the subject or the subject's representativeshall be in language that the subject or his or her representative canunderstand. No informed consent, whether oral or written, may include anyexculpatory language through which the subject or the subject's representativeis made to waive any of the subject's legal rights, or by which the subjector representative releases or appears to release the investigator, thesponsor, or the institution or its agent from liability.If a study involves both adults and children, separate consent forms shouldbe provided for the adults and the parents or guardians of the children.<T3>C. Elements of Informed Consent</T3>The elements of informed consent are as stated in the regulations at 45CFR 36.116 and 21 CFR 50.25 as follows:<ITAG tagnum="81">1. </ITAG><T3>Basic Elements of Informed Consent</T3>In seeking informed consent, the following information shall be providedto each subject:(a) A statement that the study involves research, an explanation of thepurposes of the research and the expected duration of the subject's participation,a description of the procedures to be followed, and identification of anyprocedures which are experimental.(b) A description of any reasonably foreseeable risks or discomforts tothe subject.(c) A description of any benefits to the subject or to others which mayreasonably be expected from the research.(d) A disclosure of appropriate alternative procedures or courses of treatment,if any, that might be advantageous to the subject.(e) A statement that describes the extent, if any, to which confidentialityof records identifying the subject will be maintained and that notes thepossibility that FDA may inspect the records.(f) For research involving more than minimal risk, an explanation as towhether any compensation and any medical treatments are available if injuryoccurs and, if so, what they consist of, or where further information maybe obtained.(g) An explanation of whom to contact for answers to pertinent questionsabout the research and research subject's rights, and whom to contact inthe event of research' related injury to the subject.(h) A statement that participation in voluntary, that refusal to participatewill involve no penalty or loss of benefits to which the subject is otherwiseentitled, and that the subject may discountinue participation at any timewithout penalty or loss of benefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. </ITAG><T3>Additional Elements of Informed Consent</T3>When appropriate, one or more of the following elements of informationshall also be provided to each subject:(a) A statement that the particular treatment or procedure may involverisks to the subject (or the embryo or fetus, if the subject is or maybecome pregnant) which are currently unforeseeable.(b) Anticipated circumstances under which the subject's participation maybe terminated by the investigator without regard to the subject's consent.(c) Any costs to the subject that may result from participation in theresearch.(d) The consequences of a subject's decision to withdraw from the researchand procedures for orderly termination of participation by the subject.(e) A statement that significant new findings developed during the courseof the research which may relate to the subject's willingness to continueparticipation will be provided to the subject.(f) The approximate number of subjects involved in the study. The informedconsent requirements are not intended to preempt any applicable Federal,State, or local laws which require additional information to be disclosedfor informed consent to be legally effective.Nothing in the notice is intended to limit the authority of a physicianto provide emergency medical care to the extent that physician is permittedto do so under applicable Federal, State, or local law.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Reporting Requirements</ITAG>A quarterly Financial Status Report (SF-269) and program progress reportare required. An original and two copies of these reports shall be submittedto FDA's Grants Management Officer within 30 days following each Federalfiscal quarter, except the fourth report which shall serve as the annualreport and shall be due 90 days after the budget expiration date. The programstaff shall advise the grantee of the suggested format at the appropriatetime. A final program progress report, Financial Status Report (SF-269),and invention statement must be submitted within 90 days after the expirationdate of the approved project period.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Mechanism of Support</ITAG>A. Award InstrumentSupport will be in the form of grant awards which will be subject to allpolicies and requirements that govern the research grant programs of thePublic Health Service, including the provisions of 42 CFR Part 52 and 45CFR Parts 74 and 92. The regulations promulgated under Executive Order12372 do not apply to the program.All grant awards are subject to applicable requirements for clinical investigationsimposed by sections 505, 507, 512, and 515 of the act; section 351 of thePublic Health Service Act; and regulations promulgated under any of thesesections.B. EligibilityThese grants are available to any public or private nonprofit entity (includingState and local units of government) and any for-profit entity. For-profitentities must exclude fees or profit from their request for support.C. Length of SupportThe length of the study will depend upon the nature of the study. FDA anticipatesthat a majority of the studies can be completed in 1 year. For those studieswith an expected duration of more than 1 year, noncompetitive continuationof support beyond the first year will depend on (1) performance duringthe preceding year, and (2) the availability of Federal fiscal year appropriations.D. Funding PlanThe number of studies funded will depend on the quality of the applicationsreceived and the availability of Federal funds to support the projects.Applications will be funded by priority score. However, priority may begiven to those applications for studies of the following:1. Products for rare diseases/disorders.2. Products for rare disease/disorders where there is no current therapy.3. Products for rare disease/disorders which would improve the currenttreatment/therapy.4. Products for rare diseases/disorders which are currently at a laterphase of clinical study.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Review Procedure and Criteria</ITAG>A. Review MethodAll applications submitted in response to this request for applicationswill be reviewed and evaluated for scientific and technical merit by expertsin the subject field of the specific application. The applications willalso be subject to a second level of review by a National Advisory Councilfor concurrence of the recommendations made by the first-level reviewers.In addition, applications will be reviewed before issuance of an FDA grantaward to ensure to the extent practicable that proposed studies are consistentwith requirements for investigations and marketing approval under the actand the Public Health Service Act. This would include a review to ascertainwhether an investigational new drug (IND) application or an investigationaldevice exemption (IDE) could be obtained (where applicable).B.
