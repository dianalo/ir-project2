So far,everybody's been wrong.   A biological consultant wants to put the bewhiskered mammals ona diet by putting the fish out of reach. Greenpeace says feed themmore fish. Other folks have suggested killer whales, polar bearsand even alligators to scare them.   State officials say they've tried everything feasible and are atwit's end after four years of firecrackers, painful underwaternoises, barrier nets and transporting the animals all the way tothe Pacific Ocean coast _ only to see them swim hundreds of milesback to their easy Seattle supper.   Those four years' effort cost more than $200,000, and officialshave spent more than $70,000 this year, said Joe Scordino of theNational Marine Fisheries Service. ``They're smart animals. Theyadapt very quickly and they're very keen and sensitive toeverything in their environment.''   Now frustrated wildlife managers are seeking permission to killthe animals before they eliminate a valuable run of steelhead trout.   The sea lions may be pushing a ``unique strain'' to extinctionand must be stopped for steelhead populations to return to normalin the Lake Washington watershed, said Bob Byrne of the stateDepartment of Wildlife.   Steelhead are migratory fish, born in streams and spending thefirst two years of their lives in fresh water before swimming outto sea. They live in the ocean for two years, then return to theirbirth streams to spawn. The sea lions _ 39 different animals havebeen trapped so far _ wait for returning fish in the narrow locksthat connect Puget Sound with Lake Washington.   The Wildlife Department has asked federal permission to to killthe sea lions, and Scordino said it may be allowed to do so under apublic ``health, safety and welfare'' clause in the Marine MammalProtection Act.   If given the OK, the state would kill the sea lions ``if noother option were available to protect that run'' of steelhead,Byrne said. About half the 250 people attending a public hearing inJune favored killing them, he said.   An answer is expected from the Marine Fisheries Service thismonth.   Greenpeace spokesman Ben Deeble warned that the environmentalgroup would do ``whatever it takes'' to prevent the killing of sealions.   The Ballard Locks steelhead aren't worth saving since they havemingled with fish released from hatcheries and are no longer trulywild, he said. ``If they want more steelhead to get past the sealions at the Ballard Locks, they can do it by putting moresteelhead in the system.''   Jim Neilsen, head of the state migratory fish program, said thesteelhead ``have retained a separate identity in spawning time. Ifthey're not identical to the native fish they're certainlysuccessors to them.''   Wild fish are important because as indicators of environmentalquality, Byrne said. ``Because they exist and can actually thrivein the watershed, we see we are doing a pretty good job of managingthat environment.''   Biologist Steve Shanewise of Olympia said killing sea lionswouldn't solve anything; others will continue to find the locks,requiring more killing.   ``The problem is an artificial habitat, where the fish areconfined in a narrow place,'' said Shanewise, president of CootCo., a consulting firm. Fish in the wild can hide beneath logs andother obstructions, he said, but those in the locks ``have to run astraight shot through the gauntlet of sea lions.''   At the June hearing, Shanewise and colleague Bill Way presenteda plan to build an artificial cover for the fish, including aninternal wall of ``prison bars'' parallel to the channel walls atthe locks. The bars would run from the surface to the bottom,spaced far enough apart for fish but not sea lions.   The plan ``was a real good idea, but it's going to beexpensive,'' Byrne said. It will go into an environmentalassessment, along with others received before Aug. 15, which is tobe reviewed before a decision is made.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Aug. 7</NOTE></DOC>
