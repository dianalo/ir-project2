In recent days, Koreans, long accustomed to authoritarian one-party rule, have witnessed a remarkable and historic scene: leaders of the ruling and opposition parties holding hands and announcing direct presidential elections sometime before Dec. 20. This follows agreement earlier last week on a single, five-year term for the new president.    Yet, with each step toward democracy, many Koreans, ironically, seem to feel ever more pessimistic that the nation actually will be able to achieve its first peaceful transition of power in modern history. Clearly, there is a new window of opportunity in this Asian economic powerhouse; whether it amounts to an open door to a new democratic era remains to be seen.    President Chun Doo Hwan, the former general who has ruled Korea for nearly a decade, is finding it much harder to give up power peacefully than it was to seize it in a military coup. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, his first with a Western publication in nearly two years, he tacitly acknowledges the dilemma but proclaims guarded optimism.    &quot;There will be a peaceful transfer of power,&quot; he says. &quot;You can be sure of that.&quot;    The genie of public expectations is out of the bottle, manifesting itself in many ways. Korea's once-docile workers have spent the summer striking for higher wages and freely elected trade unions. Some of the more than 2,200 work stoppages since July 1 have turned violent. Last week, Korea's 1.2 million college students returned to their campuses, where thousands promptly resumed anti-government protests, demanding Mr. Chun's immediate resignation and the release of hundreds of students still in jail.    All this has put tremendous pressure on President Chun. On the one hand, he faces the specter of a country spiraling out of control and into Philippine-style chaos. On the other hand, calling out the military to reimpose order could cause a full-scale revolutionary explosion.    President Chun expresses concern about rising labor and student unrest but says, &quot;Even if there are some difficulties, I will never use that as a pretext&quot; for a military crackdown. But he makes clear that he is determined to use the police to stop violence. Over the weekend, police arrested hundreds of protesting workers.    A small, balding man in elevator shoes, President Chun sits stiffly erect in a high-backed chair in the center of a large reception room of the Blue House -- his physical image of isolation mirroring his political position. Speaking through an interpreter, he pointedly leaves himself a way out.    &quot;There is a fundamental difference,&quot; he stresses, &quot;between a military moving into a crisis situation . . . by order of an elected president who is commander-in-chief . . . and a situation where the military moves in to overthrow a duly elected government.&quot;    For the time being, however, Mr. Chun, his hand-picked successor and his main political opponents -- each interviewed by the Journal last week -- all seem to have a vested interest in avoiding a crisis, especially because neither side wants to be seen as responsible for upsetting Korea's long-laid plans to host the Olympics next summer.    Both sides view the support of the middle class as crucial. It was middle-class support for student demonstrators in June that forced the government to reverse itself and accept the principle of direct elections. Opposition politicians hope to sweep into power on a tide of middle-class antipathy to military rule. Meanwhile, the ruling party believes that rising unrest will, in the end, cause the middle class to side with law and order.    The next month is seen as critical by almost everyone. The fear is that increasing violence by workers and students could produce such anarchy that middle-class Koreans, who so far have sided with demonstrators' demands for democracy, may suddenly seek stability and thus give the government a pretext to impose a military crackdown.    What makes Korean politics so hard to handicap is that the country has almost no history of democracy and, despite all the recent talk of it, politicians remain fundamentally interested in personal power rather than public freedom.    But the lineup of hurdles still facing Korea before a new president is sworn in next Feb. 25 is formidable.    High on the list is the selection of an opposition party candidate. Once before, the two leading opposition figures, Kim Young Sam and Kim Dae Jung, ran against each other, splitting the opposition vote. Thus far this year, neither has yielded to the other.    The next few weeks are critical to that decision. Kim Dae Jung, whom many see as the Ted Kennedy of Korean politics -- a charismatic but controversial politician whose time may have come and gone -- is returning for the first time in more than a dozen years to his home province. Unless the cheering crowds there move him to listen to his heart and not his head, Mr. Kim, 61, is likely to stand aside for Kim Young Sam, 59.    The reasons: Stephen Cardinal Kim Sou Hwan has told his fellow Catholic that a presidential run could again endanger his personal safety, given the military's antipathy for Kim Dae Jung and his 1980 conviction for plotting to overthrow the government; there's talk of Kim Dae Jung winning the Nobel Peace Prize if he forgoes a presidential run and, besides, many believe that he would be the power behind a Kim Young Sam presidency anyway.    Over a breakfast of seaweed soup, milk and eggs, Kim Young Sam, a slim grandfather just back from his daily two-mile jog, says simply, &quot;I am convinced we will have one candidate by the end of September.&quot; Though he refrains from predicting that he will be that candidate, everything else he says in an hour-long interview is spoken like a man who not only sees himself as a presidential candidate but as the next president of Korea.    The second, more troublesome hurdle is the strength of anti-government activists. Dissidents and student and labor activists, who haven't been dissuaded by promises of reform, appear to be losing support among the middle class.    These activists believe that a fair election is impossible unless President Chun is removed immediately. And many of this group don't want any of the candidates for president but rather talk vaguely of rule by the &quot;masses.&quot;    Diplomats and Korean analysts think that the radical activists are seeking a confrontation with the government that might produce the sort of bloody overreaction that would bring the middle class solidly behind them.    &quot;It's a struggle for the middle class now,&quot; a Western diplomat says.    Opposition leaders also fret about a confrontation but for different reasons: They fear that it might turn the middle class against dissent and for the government.    &quot;If labor and the students cause serious confusion, our middle class will change its attitude and want military control,&quot; Kim Dae Jung says.    In fact, Kim Dae Jung believes the government is talking openly about the prospects of confrontation with protesters in order to create a climate of fear in the country. Such fear could serve two purposes: provide a pretext for a military crackdown or, short of that, encourage Koreans to vote for the ruling party candidate as a step toward stability.    As for the military, its true intentions are much harder to discern. One foreign military analyst familiar with the Korean military says the chief of the defense security command, the top military-intelligence officer, is &quot;champing at the bit.&quot; He adds that the security command's chief and other military hard-liners, including some close to the president, are anxious to move against so-called leftists.    In the midst of all this is Roh Tae Woo, the ruling party's candidate for president. A former general who helped President Chun seize power in 1979, the 54-year-old Mr. Roh has sought to portray himself as the man who would convert Korea from Sparta to Athens. It was Mr. Roh who went on national television June 29 to outline an eight-point program for bringing democracy to Korea, including direct presidential elections, after the government had refused such moves for more than a year.    Although Mr. Roh enjoyed a brief hero status, he now must come up with further dramatic moves to separate himself in the minds of voters from his old friend, Chun Doo Hwan. Otherwise -- so unpopular is the government -- Mr. Roh risks humiliation as Koreans seize an opportunity to vote against the government and the military.    To complicate matters further, Kim Jong Pil, a former prime minister, is considering running for president. Though no one believes that he could win, he could sap votes from Mr. Roh.    Mr. Roh insists that there is a silent majority in Korea that supports growth and stability and thus him. &quot;Before June 29, we were criticized for lack of political development, and because of that, the majority of people who wanted to participate more in politics had their grievances,&quot; he said in an interview. &quot;But now, the silent majority is stronger and supports us.&quot;    Mr. Roh, who says he will campaign by stressing his primary role in the historic June 29 plan for democracy, also seems intent on running as the candidate of stability. &quot;I do not think my background as a military man is a one-sided disadvantage to me,&quot; he said. &quot;Having a military background can be advantageous in coping with the problems we have ahead.&quot;    But, by all accounts, Mr. Roh's efforts to win public support are costing him support from President Chun. Diplomats say the president isn't taking well to Mr. Roh's growing influence. &quot;Mr. Chun isn't a lame-duck type,&quot; one diplomat says. &quot;He's finding it difficult to watch his power and authority wane as Roh becomes more visible.&quot;    One member of the ruling party's inner councils who knows both men well says Mr. Roh, one of the most visible proponents of military restraint in recent months, is &quot;very worried&quot; that the president will acquiesce in calls for military intervention if -- as is widely feared -- social unrest escalates later this month.    For the moment, Mr. Roh, like President Chun, proclaims his confidence in the inevitability of democracy.    ---   South Korea    Population        42 million   GNP $120.06 billion     Per capita GNP    $2,864   Trade surplus $6.7 billion     Combined Forces Command    (Headed by a U.S. general)    U.S. troops       39,000    Korean armed      forces          600,000   Note: One-third of national budget is devoted to defense,primarily because of threat from Communist North Korea   (Economic figures are projections for 1987)   Source: Korean and U.S. governments</TEXT></DOC>
