Chinese embassies in more than 20 countries said theirambassadors were being recalled to Beijing, and a diplomatic sourcesaid they were to meet to discuss the military crackdown on themovement for a freer society.   Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin said the ``work of quellingthe counterrevolutionary rebellion and putting an end to the turmoilmust be firmly carried on.''   ``We should thoroughly expose and mete out according to lawtimely and severe punishments to the plotters, organizers andbehind-the-scenes commanders,'' the official Xinhua News Agencyquoted him as saying in his first public comments since being namedparty chief Saturday.   ``For them, an iota of forgiveness should not be given,'' Jiangadded.   His comments were in line with his reputation as a politicalhard-liner.   As party boss in Shanghai, China's largest city, he took a strongstand against political dissent and press freedom that went beyondlimits acceptable to the party.   Jiang, 62, replaced party chief Zhao Ziyang, who was stripped ofhis party posts for expressing sympathy for the student-ledpro-democracy movement.   The government says fewer than 300 people, half of them soldiers,were killed when thousands of troops clashed with civilians in thestreets and drove protesters from Tiananmen Square on June 3-4.   Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence reports say the deathtoll could be as high as 3,000, mostly civilians.   In assessing China's political agenda, Jiang said an emphasis onfundamentalist communist ideology ``doesn't mean any change in theparty's policy on intellectuals and the policy of `letting a hundredflowers blossom and a hundred schools of thought contend.'''   He was referring to a movement initiated by the late leader MaoTse-tung, who in 1957 encouraged philosophical debate. Intellectualswho spoke out against the party, however, were persecuted and purged.   Jiang, also known for vigorously promoting economic ties with theWest, said China must push ahead with reforms but distinguishbetween socialist-oriented and capitalist-oriented change.   He also said Beijing would not alter its policies toward HongKong, which reverts to Chinese control in 1997, and Taiwan, withwhich China hopes to hold reunification talks.   Jiang's comments came as China summoned its ambassadors home andthe legislature prepared to convene Thursday to endorse thegovernment's crackdown on political dissent.   Embassies in West Germany, Italy, Yugoslavia, the Philippines,Australia, Turkey, Egypt, Spain, Poland and Belgium were among thosethat said their ambassadors had left or would return to Beijing soon.   Embassy spokesmen in Washington, Moscow and Vienna, however, saidtheir envoys would remain at their posts.   Most embassies said the diplomats were returning for ``forscheduled vacation'' or ``annual home leave.''   A diplomatic source in Beijing said they would probably meet July7 for instruction on the government's position on the pro-democracymovement _ that a small group bent on overthrowing the governmentand Communist Party were behind the unrest.   The envoys also probably will discuss how to stop the rash ofdefections by Chinese diplomats overseas, the source said.   ``We assume they're going to give them the government line, andtell them to go out and sell it. And stop your people fromdefecting,'' the diplomat said, speaking on condition of anonymity.   More than 20 Chinese diplomats reportedly have asked forpolitical asylum in North America, Europe and Japan since themilitary crackdown began.   Also on Wednesday, Radio Beijing announced the arrest of YuZhenbing, 27, for forming a ``counterrevolutionary organization'' inwestern Qinghai province and spreading anti-government propaganda.   Since the crackdown began, more than 1,800 people have beenarrested, and the government says it has executed 27 pro-democracyactivists.   Most of the student leaders wanted by the government have eludedcapture, and one was seen in an emotional videotaped message playedfor reporters Wednesday in Hong Kong.   Student leader Wu'er Kaixi vowed on the videotape to continue hisfight for reforms in hiding.   ``Those of us who remain alive, our lives no longer belong toourselves,'' he said, at times choking back tears. He predicted the``wild beast,'' China's communist leadership, would fall soon.   The Communist Party continued to exhort Chinese to learn from aJune 9 speech by senior leader Deng Xiaoping, who praised themilitary for quelling the seven-week pro-democracy movement andurged support for the party. The full text of the speech waspublished on on the front pages of newspapers and read on newscasts.   Radio Beijing said 50 students in rural Shanxi province gavespeeches on Deng's discourse. Some said they had taken part in thedemocracy movement but regretted their activities, according to thereport.</TEXT></DOC>
