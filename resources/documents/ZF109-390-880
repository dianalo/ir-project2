 Recently he was on a tour with5,000 other bicyclists when a woman rode up next to him and said, &quot;Hey, didyou know that there's a company with the same name as yours that makes powerprotection stuff?&quot; Try as he might, Gordon couldn't convince her that,indeed, he was the same.andP;  Obviously, she thought it was a cheapimprovisational pickup line.andP;  Then, a few weeks later, she called (she was anengineer for an operating company) to get information on Gordon Kapes'product line.andP;  She mentioned that some guy was trying to impersonate Mr.andO;Kapes and when, again, he tried to convince her that it was in fact him, shestill seemed skeptical.andP;  Gordon is also a lover of traveling.andP;

 Makes sensewhen you thing about it.andP;  By humanizing power problems, he makes it easier tofocus on combating it.andP;  Thus, Bill's personal role model isn't a person inthe true traditional sense, but rather a more metaphysical concept, whichwe'll call, simply, Mr. Power Disturbance.andP;  Bill's actual response: &quot;Fightingbig problems (Mr.andP;  Power Disturbance) in a big market - that's myinspiration.&quot;andM;Words he/she lives by: To save equipment and eliminate downtime.andP;  First/mostbizarre telecom memory: &quot;When I called this account and that every time itthundered, they lost their telephones.&quot; Special features: Amateur radioenthusiast.andP;  &quot;I build both equipment and antennas.andP;

 Every device seemed to suppress, nothing seemed to whollyeliminate EMPs.andP;  So he invented the Lightning Spike Eliminator, a device thatcompletely quells spikes and surges, for his own personal use.andP;  The LSEboasts a unique bandwidth filter, set to a degree where no electricalphenomena can wheedle their way through.andM;That was 1982.andP;  Eight years later, Bill's ABK Electronics is a rising star inthe power protection firmament.andP;  ABK manufactures the Lightning SpikeEliminator commercially to safeguard computers, modems, PBXs and otherdigital hardware.andP;  The device is selling like hot-cakes and Mr. Kitchens issoon to announce an innovative hybrid system to fill out the product line.andM;JANE LAINOandM;Jane  Laino, founder and leader of Corporate Communications Consultants,giver of many Dollar Saving Tips to TELECONNECT and, hopefully (if there'sany justice in this crazy, mixed up world), newly elected president of TheSociety of Telecommunications Consultants.andM;Company: Corporate Communications ConsultantsandM;Title: President/ownerandM;Years in the business: 24andM;Personal role model: Harry Newton.andP;

 She had a solid telecombackground going in.andP;  Her firm is New-York based, with most of her clientsdoing business in the Big Apple.andP;  Among other things, CorporateCommunications Consultants assists end users with planning and managing theirtelephone systems, including related technologies like voice mail, callaccounting, telemanagement, etc.andP;  They do a lot of work in the financialcommunity (designing trading rooms), considerable work in cost reduction anddisaster recovery planning, and have recently gotten into telephone etiquetteseminars.andM;Jane's also (as of this writing) executive VP of The Society ofTelecommunications Consultants, a nationwide organization of independentprofessional consultants.andP;  In fact, by the time you read this, she might evenbe president of this important association.andP;  She certainly deserves it.andM;ED LAVINandM;Here's Ed Lavin (on the right) with Robert Nihon, his first venture partnerin Canadian Telecommunications Group.andM;Company: CentelandM;Personal role model: William G. McGowan Words he/she lives by: Anything canbe sold - even telephones.andP;  Special features: Enjoys keeping airline seatswarm.andM;First telecom memory: Meeting Tom Kelly, founder of TIE/communications.andO;Remote polling: Sometimes.andM;We think Ed Lavin pulled off the coup of 1990.andP;  just as the year closed, hebought Centel.... with oodles of borrowed money (about $40 to $50 million).andO;This means he used none of his own money, just lots of his own charm, whichis abundant - except when it comes to returning phone calls from TELECONNECT.andM;You see we wanted to award him with this prestigious prize.andP;  But we can'tfind him.andP;  &quot;Where are you Ed Lavin?&quot;andM;Personal details: Lavin &quot;lives&quot; on a 100-acre farm in Vermont with a Frenchwife called Marietta and a daughter called Larissa.andP;  He really lives out ofplanes  and  hotel rooms.andP;  We think Centel may have given him an office inChicago or New Jersey.andP;  We're not sure.andM;Winner of TELECONNECT's 1990 Dealmaker of the Year award.andM;JOHN LOSIERandM;John Losier, who runs  Northern's Norstar key division, has good reason to begrinning ear-to-ear OAI and its Norstar future is good  news for Northern(besides, the photog cracked a good Dan-Quayle joke to loosen up this usuallyserious executive).andM;Company: Northern/Norstar DivisionandM;Title: VP and general managerandM;Years in the business: 6 (in data processing before that)andM;Personal role models: Mickey Mantle, Ross Perot, John F. Kennedy (notnecessarily in that order).andP;  Words he/she lives by: Do what you say you'regonna do !andP;  First telecom memory: Remembers two things: actually building atreetop networking solution with cans and strings when he was seven inPleasantville, NY; and talking to relatives, especially grandma, at holidaysas a wide-eyed child.andM;Special features: John enjoys all sports in a big way (among other things,he's an avid poor golfer).andP;  Major bonus points for being a big time Giantsfan.andP;  Spends much of his away from-work time with his family, rediscoveringhis youth through his two small children.andP;  He's no handy man.andP;  It recentlytook him seven trips back and forth to Channel Hardware as he wrestled with atricky garage-door-opener installation.andP;  Maximum configuration: Unlimited.andM;John's division is responsible for Northern's Norstar key system productline.andP;  With its access toolkit, the Norstar is unique.andP;  We're talking OAIhere, folks, since the toolkit allows integration of voice processing withdata processing to create customer-pleasing applications via third-partysoftware developers.andP;  Of course, it takes a brave new man to enter this bravenew OAI world.andP;  And John is absolutely committed to making it work.andP;  Thus,he's included in this elite gaggle of telecom heroes.andM;ALBERT J. MONTEVECCHIOandM;Moscom's Albert Montevecchio not just a telecom visionary, but asophisticated gentleman to boot A great believer in heavy Randamp;D investmentandM;Company: MoscomandM;Title: Chairman/CEOandM;Years in the business: 20andM;Personal role model: His father the best role model anyone could ask for,without his total support and encouragement, Albert would not have even comeclose to attaining what he has today.andM;Words he/she lives by: The key to any company is its employees and customers.andO;The greatest contribution a CEO can make is to treat them with respect andhonesty.andM;First telecom memory: Working for a previous company, they were selling toATandamp;T (in a different market than Moscom's call accounting/telemanagement)when a person walked into the meeting and asked if this was thecall-accounting/SMDR meeting.andP;  They tracked this person down and ultimatelygot into the market.andP;  Theoretically, then, if it wasn't for one confused ATandamp;Temployee, Albert might not have built such an important relationship withATandamp;T that his present company, Moscom, enjoys.andM;Special features: Albert didn't hesitate.andP;  &quot;Golf!&quot; he said in response to ourquestion concerning outside-business activities, with the inherent enthusiasmand frustration of a bogie player.andP;  He's also a devoted family man and holdsan electrical engineering degree from Gannon University.andM;Remote polling: If you need it.andM;Albert started Moscom with a partner (since retired) in 1983.andP;  His partnerwas involved primarily in Europe, which accounts for Moscom's excellentinternational presence.andP;  From the beginning, Albert was smart enough to knowthree things: he needed to surround Himself with talented management people(he's very proud of his staff); focus heavily on leveraging majordistribution channels Moscom has some of the biggest and best channels in thecall-accounting industry); and invest heavily in Randamp;D.andP;  That last one isparticularly important to him.andM;&quot;We don't look at changes in the industry as problems.andP;  We see them asopportunities.andP;  That's why we invest so heavily in Randamp;D.andP;  In fact, the moneywe put into Randamp;D efforts is bigger than most of our competitors' overallrevenues.andP;  It's the only way to take advantage of the new opportunities andgive your customers more bang for the buck.&quot;andM;WILLIAM G.
