But under cross-examination, Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind.,steadfastly defended the record of the House intelligence committeein protecting some of the nation's most well-kept secrets.   Hamilton, the panel's former chairman, testified Wednesday thatfor 18 months before the Iran-Contra affair became public, he reliedon White House denials that North was secretly helping theNicaraguan rebels despite a congressional ban on such aid.   ``I relied on what Col. North told me,'' Hamilton said of an Aug.6, 1986, meeting the intelligence panel had with North, then aNational Security Council aide, in the White House Situation Room.   ``I believed what Col. North told me at the meeting. I did notthink there was any credible evidence to the contrary,'' Hamiltonsaid.   The congressman also said that in 1985, he accepted as``accurate, honest and correct'' then-national security adviserRobert McFarlane's assurances that North was not raising money forthe Contras or giving them tactical military advice as prohibited bythe so-called Boland Amendment of 1984.   North, a retired Marine lieutenant colonel, is charged with 12felonies arising from the Iran-Contra affair that could result in 60years imprisonment upon conviction.   Among other things, he is accused of obstructing congressionalinquiries into his efforts to raise money for the Nicaraguan rebels.This allegedly included lying at the 1986 meeting and helpingMcFarlane, who has pleaded guilty to withholding information fromCongress, draft false denials in response to congressional inquiries.   Cross-examining Hamilton, defense attorney Brendan V. SullivanJr. argued that North rightly feared Congress couldn't be trusted tokeep secrets because it ``leaked like a sieve.''   ``From 1984, 1985 and 1986 leaks occurred on Capitol Hill as aresult of members and staff members who provided information,''Sullivan said.   ``(The late CIA) Director (William) Casey told me he didn't knowa single leak from the House intelligence committee,'' Hamiltonreplied. ``I will not deny leaks, but neither can I prove any suchleaks.''   Asked about a newspaper report containing classified informationthat appeared ``the very next day'' after the panel was briefed bythe CIA, Hamilton said he had only a ``cloudy recollection'' of theincident.   ``I don't assume for a moment that the leak came from theCongress,'' Hamilton added. ``There are some very experienced peoplein the administration who leak information after it comes to theCongress.''   He also denied threatening to leak CIA information himself in aJan. 16, 1985, letter to then-Secretary of State George P. Shultz.   ``I did not threaten to leak anything,'' Hamilton said. ``I wasprepared to follow certain procedures of the House intelligencecommittee to try to release information.   ``If I had succeeded in that, it would have been an authorizeddisclosure and not a leak,'' Hamilton said, describing an elaborateprocedure by which the House would meet secretly to discussreleasing sensitive information.   The matter was dropped, Hamilton said, after Shultz met with himand said he ``agreed with my point of view.''   Hamilton conceded Sullivan's suggestion that North's prosecution``is a product in one sense of the controversy that existed betweenthe Congress and the executive branch in 1984, 1985 and 1986.''   Sullivan tried to show that North can't be faulted for hisstatements to the intelligence panel because they were made in aninformal setting when no transcript was kept and no oath to tell thetruth was administered.   Even though it was called an informal meeting, ``it's an officialmeeting of the committee,'' Hamilton responded.   ``We did not administer oaths during my period of chairmanship ofthe intelligence committee until the very end of 1986'' _ after theIran-Contra affair had become public, Hamilton said.</TEXT></DOC>
