Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., said none of eight othergovernment agencies being investigated by his special committee hasbeen as difficult to deal with.   ``The Indian Health Service has been singularly uncooperativewith our committee's investigation,'' he said. Sen. Thomas Daschle,D-S.D., said the agency's actions amounted to ``stonewalling.''   Officials of the health service were scheduled to testifyMonday, but DeConcini said the committee was not ready to begin itsquestioning because the agency had not supplied requestedinformation until Friday.   Dr. Everett Rhoades, the service's director, told reportersafter the committee meeting that the agency should have been moreforthcoming and said the committee's March 2 letter requestingdocuments had not come immediately to his attention.   By the time he learned of the letter, he said, the amount ofwork involved in meeting the request was ``astronomical.''   ``The material was out in the field,'' Rhoades said. ``It tooktime to gather.'' Nonetheless, he said, he had directed hissubordinates to give the committee everything it wanted.   Rhoades said his agency has always been cooperative.   The special committee of the Senate Select Committee on IndianAffairs has been conducting a wide-ranging investigation ofIndians, the federal agencies that serve them and privateindustries with whom they do business.   During three weeks in February and last week, the panel hasbrought under intense questioning the heads of the governmentagencies with responsibilities to native Americans.   DeConcini said that all the other agencies came forthvoluntarily, but that ``if the committee does not receivecooperation from this point forward, we will consider subpoenaingIHS for documents and testimony.''   He said documents the committee requested 10 weeks ago were notdelivered by the health service until Friday night, ``less than 72hours before this hearing.''   He said the 7,000 pages of documents came in stacks, without anindex and seemingly unorganized.   ``This weekend, the committee received information suggestingthat a possible witness may have been subjected to pressure not tofully cooperate with the committee,'' said DeConcini. ``We clearlyneed to investigate this allegation further.''   Among the witnesses who did appear before the committee Mondaywas the deputy inspector general of the criminal division of theDepartment of Health and Human Services, Larry Morey, who saidcomplaints he has investigated alleging misuse of funds indicated apossible pattern of abuse at IHS.   He said $70,000 designated for an alcohol abuse program forIndians was used for a ``retreat'' for top officials from the IHSoffice serving Albuquerque, N.M.   He said the case was new and still under investigation, but notunusual among the kinds of complaints his office has received.   Ken Ballen, chief counsel for the committee, said committeeinvestigators have determined that the retreat was held at a resortnear Santa Fe and included massage therapy for the participants,only two of whom were tribal officials.   After the hearing, Rhoades defended the gathering as aneducational experience for IHS officials who need ``to change howthey regard themselves'' before they can help others.   He said about 50 people participated in the program designed topromote ``wellness.''   ``Massage therapy is a widely accepted treatment modality'' foralcoholism, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
