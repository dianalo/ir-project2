But they can tear up a fish too bad,can hurt them too much.''   Gergley and the Bass Anglers Sportsman Society ran an experimentat major BASSmaster tournaments last year ``and we did not lose afish,'' he said.   Livewells in boats were treated with Catch and Release, made byJungle Laboratories, and water inside was cooled with ice.   Catch and Release is a tranquilizer and water conditioner. Italso adds electrolytes to water to restore them to the fish.   The water treatment also stimulates slime protection by fish.When a fish is stressed by being caught and handled, the cellswhich produce slime ``clamp up,'' Gergley said. ``Taking off theslime is like taking the skin off a human. You are going to getinfection.''   Lower the water temperature in the livewell about 15 degreesfrom lake water temperature.   ``In a good-sized livewell, five to eight pounds of ice at onetime will not hurt your fish,'' Gergley said. ``I think they willlove you for it.''   The best way to monitor water temperature is to put an aquariumthermometer in the livewell, he said. The experiments with BASS, headded, ``disproved the old wives' tale that you can't droptemperature on bass or it will kill them.''   Finally, make sure the water in the livewell is clean. If youget your boat in very shallow water and the pump sucks mud into thelivewell, change the water, even if it means you have to dip it out.   ``It's less harmful to the fish to change the water and leavethem out of water for a minute or two than to leave them in dirtywater,'' he said.   New boats, he said, have aeration and recirculating systems inlivewells, making the livewells in-boat aquariums. Older livewellscirculate water from below the boat into the livewell.   By keeping your fish alive, you can return to the water thoseyou don't need for a tournament or don't want for dinner. They cangrow and be caught another time.</TEXT></DOC>
