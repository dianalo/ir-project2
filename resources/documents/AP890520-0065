In fact, a number of well-known wordsmiths are planning booksand articles based on the tale of greed and glitter that ledproducer Robert Evans to invoke the 5th Amendment when asked totestify about the murder of theatrical producer Roy Radin.   Evans, the former head of production at Paramount Pictures, wasonly one of the colorful witnesses who drew authors, magazinewriters and a cadre of celebrity watchers to the courtroom ofMunicipal Judge Patti Jo McKay on opening day of a preliminaryhearing last week.   Author and magazine writer Dominick Dunne was there for ``VanityFair.'' So were writers Steve Wicks and Michael Fessier Jr., whoplan books on the case. A Hollywood entertainment company announcedit had already optioned the story for a TV movie-of-the-week.   The hearing, now entering its second week, will determinewhether a woman who was a reputed drug dealer and Evans associateshould stand trial along with two former bodyguards of ``Hustler''Magazine publisher Larry Flynt in the ``Cotton Club Murder Case.''A fourth defendant, also a former bodyguard of Flynt's, is fightingextradition from Maryland.   The first witness, who had ties to drugs and Flynt's securitynetwork, implicated all of the defendants in the killing of Radin,33, a corpulent, cocaine-sniffing impresario. Police reportsindicate that other witnesses will implicate Evans.   Evans, now working on a sequel to his movie ``Chinatown,'' wascalled as the first witness last week but refused to testify ongrounds that he might incriminate himself. Tanned and tense, Evanssat nervously on the witness stand while his attorney won thebattle for him not to testify. Evans refused to say even whether heknew Radin.   The case might have been invented by a Hollywood scenariowriter. It has links to the secret deals of movie power brokers,the underworld of Colombian drug dealers and Flynt's lurid pornopublishing empire. Key figures in the drama are Evans; actor DemondWilson, the former star of TV's ``Sanford And Son''; and WilliamRyder, Flynt's former brother-in-law.   The slaying of Radin became known as ``The Cotton Club Murder''because it dates back to 1983 when Evans, a top Hollywood producer,was negotiating with Radin, a flamboyant New Yorker, to raisemillions for the movie about a Harlem nightspot of the 1920s and'30s.   A woman known as Elaine ``Laynie'' Jacobs had introduced the twomen. That same woman, said to have ties to the Colombian cocainenetwork of Carlos Lehder, is really Karen DeLayne Greenberger, nowcharged in the Radin murder. Charged along with her are Alex LamotaMarti, William Molony Mentzer and Robert Ulmer Lowe, the formerFlynt bodyguards. Lowe is fighting extradition.   When Radin disappeared in May 1983, he was en route to dinnerwith Mrs. Greenberger at the fashionable La Scala restaurant inBeverly Hills. The two had been quarreling over her demand for ashare of the profits from Evans' movie. But there were otherproblems. She had accused Radin of stealing $1 million in cash andcocaine from her garage.   A month after he was seen stepping into a limousine with Mrs.Greenberger, Radin's body was found in a dry riverbed near Gormanabout 65 miles north of Los Angeles. He had been shot repeatedly inthe head.   His death made headlines, but until last year no one was chargedwith the murder. Then Ryder came forward and said he had newinformation. Authorities ``wired'' him with tape-recording devicesand sent him to gather evidence.   Since charges were filed last October, Ryder has been aprotected witness. He is expected to testify this week along withRadin's former secretary, Jonathan Lawson, and Wilson. Wilson,whose career was being managed by Radin, has said the doomedproducer feared for his life and wanted Wilson to follow him to LaScala. Wilson lost the car in traffic when the driver ran a redlight, according to his earlier account.   Most of those details were corroborated last week by Carl Plzak,the first witness to link the defendants to the crime. Plzak, abody builder and sometime Flynt bodyguard, received immunity fromprosecution in the Radin murder for his testimony. He said he heardthe others make plans to ``grab a fat pig and take him to thedesert.'' Later, he said, they told him about the murder.   Plzak's motives have been attacked by the battery of defenseattorneys who were to conclude his cross-examination Monday. Theyportrayed him as a drug user and dealer with a conviction recordand suggested he would say anything to avoid serving jail time. Headamantly declared he was telling the truth.</TEXT></DOC>
