<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-86-0195 </DOCNO><TEXT>Reconstruction of images of objects with minor dimensions by x-ray computerizedtomography methods requires the performance of accurate evaluations ofincident radiation quantum optimal energy E/sub 0/. When E/sub 0/ fallswithin photoeletric absorption jump area under non-monotonous dependence{mu}(E), it is proposed to use the recording of the past intensity withenergodispersion detectors for the object components. The value of non-linearcorrections for the measured projections is evaluated. Experiments includingthe projection intensity recording with a semiconductor Si(Li)-detectorwith 0.2 keV energy resolution are conducted. A possibility of the objectcomponent separation by contrast when recording on characteristic serieslines, located close to the edge of the material absorption of givencomponents, as well as of determination of their element composition,is investigated.</TEXT></DOC>
