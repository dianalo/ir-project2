The private Center for Plant Conservation said 73 percent of theplants facing extinction are in southerly, subtropical regions withintense economic or population growth _ Hawaii, California, Texas,Florida and Puerto Rico.   ``The causes of extinction are by now quite familiar to us _destruction of habitat, population growth, urban, suburban andindustrial sprawl, irresponsible resource extraction, overuse ofpublic land,'' Donald Falk, the center's executive director, saidMonday. ``A consequence of that is this tremendously acceleratedrate of extinction that we're seeing in these priority regions.''   Falk said some of the endangered plants are relatives ofimportant timber products, food groups, or plants used inhorticulture and landscaping.   The center's 1{-year study found that 253 species may becomeextinct within five years and another 427 may vanish by the turn ofthe century. As many as 52 of the plant species may already beextinct in the wild.   The center is a consortium of 19 botanical gardens and arboretaheadquartered in Boston.   ``What we're dealing with here is just another sign of a planetin trouble and indeed, a national environment in trouble,'' saidThomas Lovejoy, an expert on tropical rain forests and assistantsecretary for external affairs at the Smithsonian Institution.   At least 200 kinds of plants already have become extinct duringthe past two centuries, experts generally agree, andconservationists worry that the rate may accelerate as populationand economic growth jeopardize habitats. A 1973 study by theSmithsonian found that 3,000 of the nation's 25,000 species areendangered.   ``Working with endangered species means working against theclock,'' Falk said at a news conference at the Smithsonian. ``It'skind of like being in the emergency room all the time.''   Falk said it would cost $10 million to $15 million to protect andpropagate all 680 of the threatened plants, $6 million to $7 millionto target only those in the priority areas, or $3 million to $4million to save only plants facing extinction within five years.   ``Every species lost represents an irretrievable loss ofbiological diversity and potential ecological values and potentialhuman values,'' Falk said. ``Once a species goes extinct, you can'tthen change your mind. You can't then say ... that species wasbeautiful, or that might have helped medicine or that species mighthave been scientifically interesting or might have been ecologicallysignificant. You don't get a second chance with endangered species.''</TEXT></DOC>
