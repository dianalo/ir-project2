The Ariane-4 rockets will be used to put satellites into orbitbetween 1991 and 1999.   France's state-owned Aerospatiale SA is one of the major partnersin the Ariane-4 project with a 20.4 percent share. Other majorpartners include state-controlled Societe Europeenne de Propulsionand Matra SA with shares of 21.1 percent and 8.7 percentrespectively, and MAN and ERNO of West Germany with 9.3 percent and5.1 percent respectively.   Smaller contractors include British Aerospace and Ferranti ofBritain, Volvo AB of Sweden, Air Liquide of France, FabriqueNationale of Belgium, SNIA and Aeritalia of Italy, Fokker of theNetherlands and Construcciones Aeronauticas SA of Spain.   Arianespace officials estimate that by ordering 50 rockets atonce, the consortium will be able to reduce its prices by 20 percent.   The cost of an Araine-4 launch would be reduced to between $90million and $100 million, making the vehicle competitive with otherlaunchers operating in the 1990s, said Arianespace ChairmanFrederick d'Allest.   The Ariane-4, which can put a 4.2-ton payload into orbit, madeits first flight at the end of last year.   D'Allest said 1988 had been a good year for Arianespace, with netincome of about $17 million on revenue of $612 million.   He said the consortium is consolidating its 50 percent share ofthe world satellite launch market and said Arianespace's schedulefor this year includes contracts for nine launches, most of whichwill be Ariane-4s.   D'Allest expressed concern about the entry of the Chinese intothe world market with their Long March rockets. The Chinese beganoffering to put satellites in orbit for between $20 million and $25million, he said, but they have now agreed to make their prices morerealistic.</TEXT></DOC>
