In largevessel diseases in the chest, adequate imaging was possible in most cases,especially in the main, right and left pulmonary artery and the aorta.However, second order (subsegmental) and more distal order branches weresometimes judged unsatisfactory because of poor image quality. Five caseswere evaluated as inadequate because of motion, i.e. respiratory or cardiacmovement. The pulmonary circulating time was measured by the time densitycurve of the pulmonary artery and vein by digital subtraction angiography,and converse correlation between pulmonary circulating time and cardiacindex was obtained. Thus it was possible to evaluate the pulmonary circulatingdynamics. As mentioned above, intravenous digital subtraction angiographywas a useful and safe method for chest diseases, especially in evaluationof large vessels in the elderly.</TEXT></DOC>
