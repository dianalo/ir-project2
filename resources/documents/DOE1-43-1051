It is shown that the sameabundance data which exhibit a strong dependence on n-bar(H) show notendency to correlate similarly with the strength of optical depth ofthe absorption lines, in contrast to the behavior expected if the apparentdensity dependence were due primarily to effects arising from line saturation.It is demonstrated that an apparent discrepancy between S II and P IIb-values is essentially independent of the strength of the S II linesand n-bar(H). 27 references.</TEXT></DOC>
