The nationality plan, announced Wednesday by British ForeignSecretary Douglas Hurd, is designed to prevent 50,000 key Hong Kongresidents and their families from emigrating before the colonyreverts to China.   He argued that giving important people in the civil service,business and the professions the right to live in Britain wasessential to persuade them to not join the ``brain drain'' of topwhite-collar workers leaving because of concern over impendingCommunist Chinese rule.   China's promise that Hong Kong can maintain its capitalistsystem for 50 years and enjoy a high degree of autonomy has metwith widespread skepticism here, particularly after the bloodysuppression of spring pro-democracy protests in Beijing.   Hong Kong's governor, Sir David Wilson, praised the plan ashelping ``create the sort of stability and the reassurances for asubstantial number of people which we have been looking for.''   Honor Hong Kong, a group of top business leaders formed to pressfor right of residency in Britain, also welcomed the package asencouraging key white-collar staff to remain in the territory.   ``We argued for more, we should have been given more; but thisfigure - we believe _ is a basis on which to rebuild confidence inour economy,'' said Simon Murray, the group's chairman.   Murray noted that a private study released last week estimatedas many as 315,000 key workers were essential to maintaining HongKong's vibrant economy.   Community leaders on the colony's Legislative Council who havelong argued that the right of residency should be granted to all3.25 million Hong Kong Chinese eligible for British passports vowedto pressure London to broaden the program.   Some expressed worries the plan will divide the community asonly 4 percent of the colony's 5.7 million people will qualify.Fears also were voiced that the offer will not stop the brain drain.   The lobbying group British Citizens for Hong Kong issued astatement saying the plan ``will have no effect in stemming theoutflow and ... is a divisive and dishonorable gesture of dismissalby Britain ...''   Wong-hyo, vice chairman of the Hong Kong Chinese Civil Servants'Association, was quoted by the Standard as saying the package was``inadequate to keep up morale and retain staff.''   Although the Xinhua News Agency, China's official representativein the colony, refused to comment on the package, a newspaper thatoften reflects Beijing's thinking was critical of the plan.   The Chinese-language Wen Wei Po argued that the package showedBritain was only concerned with maintaining the territory'sprosperity until 1997.   ``If the society is divided into two types of people who havedifferent futures and benefits, it would be very difficult for themto unite and live through the transitional period and the yearsafter,'' the paper said in an editorial.   ``To solve Hong Kong's confidence crisis, Hong Kong peopleshould develop trust in themselves'' and put into effect the ``onecountry, two systems'' policy China has promised for the territory,it said.</TEXT></DOC>
