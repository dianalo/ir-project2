Speculation about what a defendant might do in the future isnot admissible.;   More than a dozen times during the relentless questioning,the woman wept and repeatedly told Black that while she may have made a fewmistakes about the &quot;chronological order&quot; of the alleged events of March 30, itwas because she was so &quot;messed up&quot; by the trauma of the rape.;   Pantyhose astopic;   Portraying the evening as a romantic night of dancing, amorouskissing and late-night strolling on the beach, Black asked her more than 15times where and why she took off her black Givenchy pantyhose. They were foundinside her car, a Mazda RX-7, in the parking lot of the Kennedy family'soceanfront estate. In one statement to police, she had speculated that shemight have taken them off because Smith invited her to go for a stroll on thebeach.;   &quot;You weren't invited to go on the beach until you were in thekitchen,&quot; Black said to her, &quot;so you didn't take them off because you thoughtyou were going to the beach. Is that right?&quot;;   &quot;I didn't know I was going tothe beach,&quot; she acknowledged, breaking into tears. &quot;So it had to be for someother reason. . . . I don't know.&quot;;   Palm Beach police, criticized for notsurveying for 13 days the alleged crime scene at the Kennedy estate, had takenan extraordinary number of statements from her. Several lawyers have notedthat any time a person retells a story, there are slight variations.;  &quot;Little bits and pieces come back,&quot; she testified in explaining thediscrepancies. &quot;I have had flashbacks.&quot;;   At another point, she said, &quot;It'sdifficult to put it in chronological order when you are recalling frommemory.&quot;;   She said she had been awake for 36 hours before making heroriginal statement to police.;   &quot;I was scared to death,&quot; she said.;   Blackresponded by asking her why she could remember such minute details as thecolor and style of the jacket worn by Smith's uncle, Sen. Edward Kennedy,D-Mass., or the fact that she drank Cliquot champagne and ate rigatoni a lavodka that night, but could not recall when she removed her pantyhose orwhether she had left the bar to meet another man that night.;   'Your clientraped me';   On the last cross-examination, she had four final words forBlack: &quot;Your client raped me.&quot;;   Legal experts generally agreed the allegedvictim was an exceedingly effective witness when she took the stand Tuesdayafternoon, but they were split over whether the defense regained lost groundduring Thursday's cross-examination.;   Kennedy was rumored to have arrivedThursday in Palm Beach and is likely to testify today.; TV coverage; Coverageof the William Kennedy Smith trial can be found today on:; (box)Court TVchannel (25B on Heritage Cablevision) -- 6 a.m.; (box)KOFY (Ch. 20) -- 8:30a.m.; (box)CNN -- Live coverage, 5:30 a.m.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Mercury News Wire Services  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  West Palm Beach, Fla.  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911206  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  December  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  652  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday, December 6, 199100341055,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENGFRONT  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
