Thestock was selling at about $7 each. After the announcement ofthe deal before the market opened on May 11, the share pricejumped to more than $15.   On May 8, Deborah Castellucci bought 5,400 Modulaireshares based on nonpublic information given to her by Mr.Behar, the SEC said. She had been hired by Modulaire twoyears earlier to devise a pension plan for the company.   Meanwhile, Mr. Wailes had been keeping his wife, Adrienne,apprised of the progress of negotiations, the SEC said; about8:32 a.m., May 8, he called her from his office. Mrs. Wailesthen began calling friends and relatives &quot;in rapid successionto tip them to buy Modulaire before the acquisition wasannounced,&quot; according to the complaint.   The SEC said Mrs. Wailes called: Dorothy Carter, whosehusband, Donald, bought 4,300 shares; Mary Alice Graves, whobought 750 shares, and Christopher Scott, who bought 4,200shares but canceled his purchases before settlement. DorothyCarter then spoke to her son-in-law Jon Treder to pass alongthe tip, the SEC said. He bought 1,500 shares and his father,who wasn't charged, bought 750, the agency said.   The Wailes' son, Deven, who lived with his parents, alsofound out about the takeover from his mother and bought 5,000shares, although he also canceled the order beforesettlement.   Under their settlement agreements, Mr. Behar will disgorge$43,200, which amounts to Ms. Castellucci's profit. Ms.Castellucci and Mr. Behar also will each pay a penalty of$43,200.   Mrs. Wailes will pay a penalty of $78,130 representing theprofit of the people she allegedly tipped. The Carters willdisgorge and pay a penalty totaling $81,675, including Mr.Treder's profit. Mr. Treder will pay $30,525 in profit andpenalty, including his father's profit. Ms. Graves will pay atotal $12,375 in disgorgement and penalty.   Christopher Scott and Deven Wailes have agreed not toviolate securities laws in the future.   Mr. Behar's attorney, Kurt Mueller, said that by settling,his client &quot;is neither admitting nor denying guilt. In fact,he does not admit it.&quot; He also said Mr. Behar agreed tosettle because it would cost &quot;far more to litigate this casethan to settle it, not to mention the grief that litigationwould cause.&quot;   Ted Phillips, attorney for Ms. Castellucci, declined tocomment.</TEXT></DOC>
