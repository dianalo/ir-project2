(``PHLX'' or``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission''),pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')\1\<NOTE/> and rule 19b-4 thereunder,\2\<NOTE/> a proposed rule change to expand and extend the Exchange'sAutomated Options Market (``AUTOM'') system pilot program through December31, 1989. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1982). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4 (1988).  AUTOM is an on-line system that allows electronic delivery of options ordersfrom member firms directly to the appropriate specialist on the PHLX optionstrading floor, with electronic confirmation of order executions. Becauseall orders received through AUTOM are exposed to the specialist's limitorder book, the trading crowd, and to at least one registered options trader(``ROT''),\3\<NOTE/> the Exchange believes best execution of AUTOM orders is assured.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ PHLX Rule 1063(a) requires an Options Floor Broker toascertain that at least one ROT is present at the trading post prior torepresenting an order for execution.  All orders entered into the system are executed manually by the specialist,who, upon execution of the order, enters the relevant trade information(<T3>e.g.,</T3> the number of contracts executed, the price, and the identityof the contra-broker(s) into the system. An execution report then is sentautomatically to the firm that placed the order. In its rule filing seeking implementation of the AUTOM system, the PHLXnoted that the AUTOM system, including hardware as well as software, iscompletely separate from an independent of the hardware and software forPHLX's Philadelphia Stock Exchange Automated Communication and Execution(``PACE'') system for routing and executing stock orders. The Exchangestated that because the systems are independent, one system cannot havean adverse impact on the other during volume surges in terms of volumehandling capabilities or queuing.\4\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ Letter from Michael A. Finnegan, Senior Vice President,PHLX, to Howard L. Kramer, Assistant Director, Commission, dated March22, 1988.  In Securities Exchange Act Release No. 25540 (March 31, 1988), 53 FR 11390,the Commission approved implementation of the AUTOM system on a 90-daypilot basis. The Commission approved the Exchange's request that the pilotinclude up to 12 equity options, up to five order entry firms, and up tosix specialist units. During the pilot phase, only market orders of fiveor fewer contracts in the near-term expiration month were made eligiblefor delivery through the system for manual execution. In Securities Exchange Act Release No. 25868 (June 30, 1988), 53 FR 25563,the Commission approved a six-month extension of the pilot period, as wellas an expansion of the pilot to include an additional 25 equity options,bringing to 37 the total number of equity options eligible for deliverythrough the AUTOM system. In Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26354 (December 13, 1988), 53 FR51185, the Commission approved a modification to the existing 37-optionspilot, making all pilot options' strikes and expiration months eligibleto be handled by AUTOM and increasing the eligible order size for AUTOMto 10 contracts. The Commission also approved an extenisoin of the modifiedAUTOM pilot until June 30, 1989. The Exchange now proposes to expand the AUTOM pilot to include an additional25 equity options, increasing to 62 the number of equity options that wouldbe permitted to be traded in the AUTOM pilot. The Exchange also requeststhat the AUTOM pilot be extended until December 31, 1989.\5\<NOTE/> The Exchange requested accelerated approval of this proposedrule change so that the AUTOM pilot can be expanded without disruption.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ Letter from William W. Uchimoto, General Counsel, PHLX,to Mary N. Revell, Esquire, Division of Market Regulation (``Division''),Commission, dated January 25, 1989.  To date, executed volume through AUTOM has been minimal.\6\<NOTE/> While overall transaction volume has not appreciably increasedin the expanded pilot, the Exchange is approaching the pilot's 37 optionslimit, having placed 34 options on the pilot at this time. The Exchangeassets that expanding the pilot to include an additional 25 equity optionswould better serve users, attract additional interest to the system, andwould allow the PHLX to gain further trading experience to assess AUTOMas a permanent enhancement. In all other respects, the Exchange commitsto operating the pilot as represented in prior rule filings. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ In this regard, the Exchange does not foresee any significanttaxing of the Exchange's computer systems if the Commission approves theexpansion of the pilot as proposed herein. In all other respects, the Exchangestands by its representations conveyed in letters to Howard Kramer, AssistantDirector, Division, Commission, from Michael A. Finnegan, Senior Vice President,PHLS, dated March 22 and 30, 1988.  The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with therequirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicableto a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirementsof section 6 \7\<NOTE/> and section 11A \8\<NOTE/> and the rules and regulations thereunder. The Commissioncontinues to believe that the development and implementation of AUTOM willprovide for more efficient handling and reporting of orders in PHLX equityoptions through the use of new data processing and communications techniques,thereby improving order processing and turnaround time. The Commissionalso believes that the AUTOM system, by offering increased order routingefficiencies, should benefit public customers and PHLX member firms andcustomers.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ 15 U.S.C. 78f (1982).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ 15 U.S.C. 78k-1 (1982).Expanding the existing 37 options AUTOM pilot to permit up to 62 equityoptions to be handled by AUTOM and extending the pilot period for six months(<T3>i.e., </T3>through December 31, 1989) should enable the Exchange tobetter assess the effectiveness of the AUTOM system. The PHLX believesthat the AUTOM system will be able to handle the increased volume thatshould accompany expansion of the pilot to 62 equity options. As notedabove, the AUTOM system is completely independent from the Exchange's PACEsystem. Therefore, neither AUTOM nor the PACE system should impact on theother during periods of high volume. Moreover, as noted in the originalorder approving implementation of the AUTOM pilot,\9\<NOTE/> the PHLX asserts that the AUTOM system has significant excessorder handling and disc capacity.\10\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ 53 FR 11390-91.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ In particular, the PHLX informed the Commission thatthe AUTOM system's order handling and disc capacity was five times theestimated daily order flow for the original pilot, and that the AUTOM systemcapacity could be increased up to five times that capacity if needed. <T3>See </T3>letter from Michael A. Finnegan, Senior Vice President, PHLX,to Howard L. Kramer, Assistant Director, Division, Commission, dated March30, 1988. Based on the Exchange's experience to date under the pilot program,the Commission believes that increasing the number of equity options eligibleto be handled by AUTOM should not impact adversely the ability of AUTOMto handle the necessary volume levels.The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule changeprior to the thirtieth day of publication of notice of filing in the <T4>Federal Register. </T4>The Commission previously solicited commenton the AUTOM pilot program and has not received any negative comments onits operation. Moreover, the current pilot program has operated effectivelysince its implementation in April, 1988. Finally, the Commission's approvalis limited until December 31, 1989, or until the Commission acts on theExchange's request for permanent approval of the pilot program.Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and argumentsconcerning the foregoing.
