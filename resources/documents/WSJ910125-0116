Top Pentagon officials say they still want to wait beforestaging a big ground offensive. But there are hints limitedU.S. ground action could come sooner -- to draw Iraqi troopsout of defended positions, or to spur defections by crushingone or two Iraqi units. Military officials say the next weekmay see increasing allied movements on the ground andpreparations by Marine amphibious troops at sea.</LP><TEXT>   But former Defense Secretary Harold Brown warns Iraq couldtry to start ground action too, hoping to set off a war ofattrition by lobbing poison-gas artillery shells at U.S.forces. If so, he says &quot;there may be pressure&quot; to respond,but &quot;it would be a mistake&quot; to do so until the allies areready.   Some Iraqi units have already tried to move into betterfiring positions, drawing U.S. counterattacks.                                                                                                          GREENSPAN'S OPTIMISM draws fire in Washington and on WallStreet.   With interest rates and oil prices down since the warbegan, the Fed chief argues that the worst of the recessionis past. But Philip Braverman of DKB Securities in New Yorkasserts such arguments are &quot;misguided,&quot; while SalomonBrothers economist Robert DiClemente says, &quot;The chairman'sremarks are bolder than the evidence.&quot;   Greenspan's views lead administration officials to fear hewon't cut rates enough to combat the credit crunch. GOP Sen.D'Amato bitterly attacks him at a hearing -- then leavesbefore he can reply. Like many forecasters, the Fed chiefassumes a quick war and a rebound in consumer confidence. ButDiClemente cautions: &quot;As long as you've got this {war}backdrop, it puts a chill on spending plans.&quot;                                                                                                          GORBACHEV'S CRACKDOWN in the Baltics creates a quandaryfor the U.S.   The weekend trip here by new Soviet Foreign MinisterBessmertnykh could be decisive in shaping a U.S. response.Baker has been holding strategy sessions this week lookingfor ways to respond, but the overriding concern is thatGorbachev would in turn withdraw support for the Gulf war.   Some top officials think the Soviets are in too deep toback out of their cooperation on the Gulf now. But othersfear Gorbachev could insist that he supports the U.N.resolutions while accusing the U.S. of going far beyond them.The administration was jolted by a surprise anti-U.S.commentary in Pravda that accused Bush of seeking NATOhegemony in the Mideast.   If he wants to, Bush could easily postpone the Feb. 11summit, since the nuclear-arms pact it was meant to sign isbogged down by Red Army stalling.                                                                                                          ISRAEL WARNS that it has plenty of possible targets forretaliation against Iraq that the allies haven't yet hit. Amilitary official hints that Israel wouldn't be squeamishabout striking targets near where civilians live. &quot;We couldmake it so the Iraqis are using gas lamps for the next 100years,&quot; he says.                                                                                                          RESENTMENT RISES against Japan and Germany over their warefforts. In the new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, 42% ofvoters say they've lost respect for Japan during the crisis,while only 10% say they gained respect. By 23% to 17%, theyhave lost respect for Germany.                                                                                                          THE MEDIA GROW in public esteem, according to the newJournal/NBC poll: 45% say they have gained respect for themedia since the war broke out, while only 20% have lostrespect. But voters are unsympathetic to press complaintsthat the military is holding back information; by 73% to 23%,they say the Pentagon has been open enough.

DEMOCRATIC DIVISIONS deepen over the Gulf war.   Moderates gnash their teeth at plans for this weekend'smeeting of party liberals at a time when public opinionoverwhelmingly sides with Bush. Speakers include JesseJackson and Sens. Kennedy, Wellstone and Harkin. &quot;It lookslike the anti-war left is reconstituting itself,&quot; says partystrategist Mike McCurry.   Potential presidential candidates who opposed Bush on useof force now vie to outstrip each other in praise of thetroops. Gephardt lauds the &quot;lionhearted wives and husbands&quot;of those serving. Cuomo declares at a rally that &quot;we are hereto support our country and our president . . . {and} ourheroic armed forces.&quot;   Gore, the only major hopeful who backed use of force, nowmoves to stake out a position on how the peace can be wonfollowing a victorious war.
