The British flag carrier announced Friday it was pulling out ofthe group led by UAL management and pilots that has been strugglingto resurrect a buyout offer for the company, parent of the secondlargest U.S. airline.   The group's Oct. 13 announcement that it had failed to line upbank financing for its original $6.75 billion buyout plan helpedspark the second-worst U.S. stock market plunge ever.   Since then, the group has been trying to get support for arevised proposal at a lower price, about $5.62 billion.   Under the original buyout agreement, British Airways would haveprovided $750 million, or about three-quarters of the neededcapital for the takeover, and received a 15 percent stake in UAL.   British Airways in a brief statement Friday morning said it``does not intend to participate in any new deal for theacquisition of UAL in the foreseeable future.''   The company would not comment on its reasons for the decision.However, the statement noted that British Airways' two-year-oldmarketing agreement with United Airlines would remain in effect,and there is no change in the company's strategic objectives ofseeking marketing alliances and partnerships with other airlines.''   European airlines have been scrambling to link up with eachother and with American and Asian airlines to form mega-carriersbetter equipped to compete in the increasingly global andcompetitive air travel industry.   Analysts said the British Airways decision likely was a deathknell for the UAL buyout. But they also speculated the Britishcarrier might participate in a future buyout plan or other hookupwith another airline.   ``British Airways still ultimately would like to have a greaterpresence in the U.S. and Pacific markets,'' said Andy Chambers, ananalyst with Nomura Securities in London.   The analysts said they weren't surprised by British Airways'decision.   The withdrawal ``would be regarded as fairly positive in theshort-term,'' Chambers said. ``It's actually going to enhance theircash flow in the immediate future.''   ``Personally, I welcome it,'' said Nick Cunningham, an airlinesanalyst with the London investment firm Laing and Cruickshank. ``Idon't think they needed to do this deal. I think they were worriedthat some other European airline would take a stake. That's nowless likely.''   Cunningham cited the U.S. Department of Transportation's recentdecision to force KLM Royal Dutch Airlines to reduce its plannedstake in Northwest Airlines. KLM was part of an investor group thatacquired Northwest parent NWA Inc. earlier this year for $3.65billion.   Even though KLM's proposed holding was under the 25 percentlimit the U.S. government imposes on foreign stakes in Americanairlines, the Transportation Department decided the size of KLM'sinvestment would give it too much influence.   ``I think that's why British Airways feels pretty safe pullingout. They can always come back if another European airline stepsin,'' Cunningham said.   If British Airways really wanted a 15 percent stake in UnitedAirlines, it could buy it in the open market at a much cheaperprice, he said.   British Airways' shares fell the equivalent of 2 cents to closeat $3.13 a share Friday on London's Stock Exchange.</TEXT></DOC>
