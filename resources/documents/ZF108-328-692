 Running on a PC, its first module contains comprehensive facilitiesfor designing forms plus extensive features for setting up forms for avariety of printing applications.andP;  Two other modules to be available laterwill enable filling in forms from the keyboard or from a database.andM;The first module, called F3 Pro Designer, will be released later this month.andO;It takes into account the specification for many aspects of how the form orenvelope will be printed: the number of pages and carbons, the location ofholes to be punched in the form, the position of the window in the envelope,colors to be used, and so on.andP;  This information is selected from dialog boxesthat display all of the industry standard sizes and configurations, plusoptions for specifying different ones.andM;As with other aspects of the program, both the keyboard and a mouse areavailable for most operations.andM;In addition to specifying this setup information, the operator can includenotes, comments and instructions on how the form is to be printed.andP;  Theseinstructions are output as a separate piece of film that can be overlaid onthe form for convenience.andM;Building a form.andP;  F3 Pro Designer provides a WYSIWYG view of a form beingcreated, using Bitstream's Speedo system for displaying fonts.andP;  Two grids areavailable for alignment of elements; the operator selects either one asneeded.andP;  The screen can be zoomed, as comparing the two photos on these pagesindicates.andM;Rectangles and circles can be drawn on the screen conveniently in ruleweights specified in 1/10-point increments and in solid, dotted, dashed orscreened representation.andM;If some rules are already drawn on the screen, additional ones automaticallyseek natural boundaries--they extend to the next rule they meet.andP;  If they areto be extended farther, the operator grabs them and extends them as desired.andO;Rules also can be drawn from one specified point to another.andM;Where rules join, the corners can be constructed in a variety of ways:beveled, mitred, squared, etc.andP;  In the case of rectangles, not only canindividual corners be specified independently as round, square or inverted,but each corner can have an inside specification as well as an outside one(e.g., square on the outside and round on the inside).andM;Combs can be created, although currently it isn't possible to give thedifferent teeth of a comb different heights, as might be desired for fillingin a social security number or another number with multiple parts.andM;Multiple elements can be created automatically by indicating the number to becreated within a certain area or by indicating the total area and how farapart adjacent items are to appear.andP;  It is also possible to create oneelement and repeat it any number of times starting at a specified distancehorizontally or vertically from the original.andM;Individual elements can be grouped and acted on.andP;  An undo feature reversesthe last editing operation.andM;Forms templates can be created and stored for later use.andP;  Parts of forms alsocan be saved and reused.andM;As many as four 32-page forms can be open for editing at one time.andM;Adding text and graphics.andP;  Text can be imported from a few word processingprograms or typed within F3 Pro Designer.andP;  Text that is typed on the screencan be keyed outside the form area and moved into place.andP;  The operatordefines the typographic parameters (font, size, etc.) an d the gutter toappear between the form's rules and the text.andP;  Automatic leading isavailable, taking into account the largest point size on the line.andP;  Text canbe rotated in one-degree increments.andM;Editing is done in a window on the screen.andP;  Editing features appear to beadequate for the application: search/replace, delete word, change bold toitalics, and so on.andM;Automatic pair and track kerning are available in four degrees: none, loose,medium and tight, using Bitstream-provided tables.andM;Graphics in TIFF and EPS formats can be imported.andM;System requirements.andP;  F3 Pro Designer requires a minimum of an 80286 PC with640k of memory and an EGA monitor or better.andP;  If additional memory isavailable, the program will use it to speed the screen response.andP;  Output isto PostScript machines or HP LaserJet II-compatible printers.andM;F3 Pro Designer costs $795 with 13 fonts.andM;Futures.andP;  F3 Design by Data will contain all of the composition features ofF3 Pro Designer plus the ability to build forms quickly by working with anexisting database.andP;  Individual fields in the database will be converted toinformation areas on the form, with text labels and selected graphicenclosures.andM;When a form has been composed and the fields have been defined in F3 Designby Data, it will be distributed to central repositories on various local areanetworks within an organization or directly on a PC disk.andP;  Then, operatorsusing F3 Fill will be able to fill in the form by tabbing fromfield to field.andM;F3 Design by Data will cost $1,295, including one copy of F3 Fill, of whichadditional copies will cost $150 each.andM;Cirle, Solustan tackle languagesandM;Circle Noetic Services had demonstrated its Dashes hyphenation programs onthe Macintosh previously.andP;  Dashes, which can be used in conjunction with anypage composition program that already supports the use of discretionaryhyphens, is intended to improve the quality of hyphenation both by being surethat hyphenation points are correct and by locating as many correct points aspossible to make them available during the line-breaking process.andP;  Itprovides multiple preference levels to enable the user to restricthyphenation to a certain quality level.andM;At the Seminars, Circle and Solustan Inc. announced the ability to hyphenate16 languages on a PC running Ventura Publisher.andP;  The 16 languages, which canbe displayed and hyphenated, are Croatian, Danish, Dutch, English, Fin nish,French, German, Greek, Icelandic, Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese, Russian,Spanish, Swedish and Turkish.andP;  The most difficult ones have been Greek,Russian and Turkish, for which there is no standard character set.andM;These products come as loadable hyphenation modules working directly withinVentura.andP;  They can be used in two ways: in &quot;classic&quot; style, which providesbetter quality by limiting hyphenation to preferred points, and &quot;narrowcolumn&quot; style, which inserts more hyphens to achieve a tighter fit.andP;  CircleNoetic claims that its hyphenation accuracy is 99% and that it finds 98% ofthe points at which hyphens can be used if necessary.andP;  We didn't attempt totest that hyphothesis, but in the past we have been impressed by the accuracyof Circle's hyphenation.andM;Hyphenation modules for Ventura Publisher cost $145 for each language, withsite licenses and quantity discounts available.andP;  A demonstration disk thatincludes all of the available languages can be purchased from Solustan for$25.andM;Indian scripts on Mac, PC.andP;  Solustan also has developed a desk accessory forthe Macintosh that enables the operator to work in any of four Indian scriptsthat are used with seven languages.andP;  The program, called MacKalam, enablesthe keyboard to take on the standard layout adopted by the Indian governmenta few years ago.andP;  It requires fewer keyboard levels than most Indiantypesetting programs because of its approach to forming conjunct (combined)characters.andP;  Instead of attempting to put dozens of conjunct characters onindividual keys, MacKalam generates these characters using the basicconsonant characters and an algorithm.andP;  A &quot;link&quot; key indicates that twoconsonants are to be joined.andM;One Indian script and English can be mixed within the same job.andM;Solustan demonstrated MacKalam running with ReadySetGo.andM;The PC version runs under Gem and was exhibited running with VenturaPublisher, Logitech's Finesse page composition program and Delrina's PerFormforms creation system.andM;Solustan has an office in the U.S.andP;  and one in the UK (Polydiam).andP;  It isplanning to open an office in India also.andM;DeScribe makes progress with 1.1andM;The folks at DeScribe apparently take our criticisms to heart.andP;  After seeingDeScribe Word Publisher at the Seybold Computer Publishing Conference inSeptember, we had praised many of its features, but harped on a fewtypographic inadequacies (see Vol.andP;  4, No.andP;  3, p. 41).andP;  Most of the featureswe requested at that time showed up in the beta version of release 1.1 thatwe saw in Boston.andM;Special text.andP;  One of our biggest beefs had been the difficulties of creatingsome special kinds of text, such as sub-and superscripts, fractions anddropped capitals.andP;  In the old DeScribe, the user had to manually adjust pointsizes, baselines and so forth.andP;  Now these processes have been automated.andM;Although we're glad to see these features in place, some of theirimplementations still fall short of professional publishers' requirements.andO;Dropped caps are probably the best addition: the user can define the numberof drop lines, point size and set width, or merely pick the number of droplines and let the program take its best guess at the other parameters.andO;However, when text is selected for conversion to small caps, the programautomatically reduces it to a (non-specifiable) smaller point size; we wouldrather be able to define separate percentages for the height and width ofsmall caps.andP;  Text defined as part of a fraction is also automatically reduced(again with no user control), and the leading is changed, but the user mustselect the numerator and denominator separately.andP;  Similar drawbacks exist formost other special-text operations.andM;In all of these cases, the user can reformat the new text by hand, but thatwould defeat much of the value of automatic formatting.andP;  DeScribe'sformatting features outdo those of word processors, but fall short of theones offered by leading composition/layout programs.andM;Indexes and TOCs.andP;  DeScribe now supports multiple indexes and tables ofcontents.andP;  Items are added to indexes via menus or control keys; if there aremultiple indexes, the control key specifies the appropriate one.andP;  Text for atable of contents can be defined in the document or it can be typedseparately.andM;The user can choose from a variety of index formats, changing the indentingof each level of entry, the type of separator and the style of separatorcharacter.andP;  For a table of contents, page numbers can appear at the left orright edge.andM;Once the user generates an index, it is not interactive; if page numberschange, it must be regenerated by a simple comman d.andM;Graphic tools.andP;  Tools for creating graphics have been pumped up considerably.andO;The user can now create squares (with or without rounded corners), circles,ovals, polygons, perpendicular or freehand lines, and Bezier or Filletcurves.andP;  Objects can be shaded with any of 16 colors or multiple fillpatterns.andM;Graphics can now be cropped proportionally or anamorphically.andP;  One graphicobject can be placed inside another.andP;  Transparent text objects can becreated, letting a graphic object behind them show through.andM;DDE.andP;  Thanks to new support for OS/2's Dynamic Data Exchange, a user can nowcopy a spreadsheet or graph from any of a wide variety of programs into aDeScribe document.andP;  When the original file is updated, the new result isdisplayed in the document.andP;  DeScribe's powerful multilevel Undo feature hasbeen extended to these graphics, enabling a user to restore, for example, aprevious background color to an active Microsoft Excel graph.andM;Other enhancements.andP;  A host of other large and small enhancements have beenadded, showing DeScribe's commitment to improving the program.andM;* DeScribe can now import text and formats from many leading word processors.andO;Graphics from common formats can be converted to bitmaps or PresentationManager metafiles.andM;* The user can zoom a page display in or out in single-percentage incrementsand can view several &quot;thumbnail&quot; pages at once.andP;  By splitting a document intotwo windows, the user can make changes in an actual-size windows and see themreflected in a zoomed view.andM;* Five-point or smaller text is greeked, but it shows word spacing, lineendings, dropped caps, and sub- and superscripts.andM;* Outline (hollow) text can be created.andM;* Rules flow with text--a feature that even some leading layout programslack.andM;* A block of text can be locked with a password; other users can still changethe formatting of that text, but cannot add or delete characters.andM;DeScribe 1.1 is due to be released in May.andP;  Localized versions of the earlierDeScribe are now available in France, Germany and the UK.andM;Island shows IslandWrite under MotifandM;Island Graphics demonstrated the IslandWrite page composition program runningin the OSF Motif graphical environment on a Sun-4 platform using F3 fonts.andM;The basic functionality hasn't changed, but the product is more polished thanpreviously and has been gien a few new features.andM;IslandWrite started as an interactive layout program, but it is being givenmore features for technical documentation.andP;  It now supports unlimited pageformats, the ability to mix portrait and landscape pages within a document,support for multiple languages within the same document (even to thecharacter level) and Proximity dictionaries for hyphenation and spellingchecking.andM;A &quot;fast menu&quot; enables ready access to commonly used commands.andP;  Guides andgrids are available for snapping elements to a page.andM;When text exceeds the space available in a container, two different flagsdenote the status: one to show that text has been linked to another containerand one to show that the overflow text is being held until assigned toanother container.andM;SunWrite costs $595, or $1,000 if packaged with SunPaint and Draw.andM;Silicon Beach's Personal Press still simpleandM;We first saw Silicon Beach's Personal Press page layout program (in earlyform) at the Computer Publishing Conference last September (see Vol.andP;  4, No.andO;4, p. 53).andP;  At the time, most of the planned features had been implemented,but handamp;j functions were still absent.andP;  We made a point of seeing them inBoston.andM;Personal Press's handamp;j resembles most of its other features: sufficient forsimple applications, but not powerful enough for professional use.andP;  The usercan specify the length of the smallest hyphenatable word, the minimum numberof characters before (but not after) a hyphen, whether to hyphenatecapitalized words, and the maximum num ber of consecutive hyphenated lines.andO;There are no letterspacing controls and no widow/orphan controls.andM;Several other improvements have been make to Personal Press since September.andO;Although it was not demonstrated, rotated text will be editable.andP;  All linkeditems can now be highlighted together.andP;  Graphics can be previewed in color.andO;The search and replace routine works with fonts, styles and sizes of text.andM;Aldus acquired Silicon Beach earlier this year, so in theory PageMaker-likefunctions could be implemented in Personal Press.andP;  We were told, though, thatPersonal Press (which was due for a late March release) will be kept as asimpler program, without the mounting complexity that can intimidate noviceusers.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
