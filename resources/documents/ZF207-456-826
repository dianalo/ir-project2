What applications do you think of when you hear the word &quot;text&quot;?andO;Probably word-processing and mail-merge, maybe desktop publishing or textretrieval.andP;  E-mail perhaps.andP;  And that's probably it.andM;But there's much, much more.andP;  As with data (but 20 years later), there's aproliferation of text tools and applications based on client-serverarchitectures -- a text store as a back-end, with text applications asfrontends.andP;  In other words, a text application doesn't load a file; itselects the text or data it needs from shared files that can be usedconcurrently by other users or applications.andP;  This offers the same assurancesof integrity of text across applications and multi-user access as a databasedoes for more structured data.andM;The first system described here is Xanadu, the 19-year-old global textserverproject of hypertext guru Ted Nelson that has gained a poor reputation amongmany who were excited a few years ago but have waited too long in vain.andP;  Nowthere's visible progress at Xanadu -- mostly because of its 80percentpurchase by Autodesk, which has a practical application for this systemcreated by visionaries.andP;  Autodesk is visionary enough to support Xanadu'slong-term goals while insisting on short-term results.andM;Xanadu is building a back-end, which will come with its own front-endapplication and also support a more specialized system from Autodesk formanaging AutoCAD data.andP;  The dream behind Xanadu includes the idea of&quot;hypertext publishing,&quot; whereby people put their efforts into a gianttext/database, and other people or smart agents help readers find and selectonly what they want.andP;  Early efforts in this direction include AnteriorTechnology's In Moderation, and Pinpoint's Computer Focus and Individual'sFirst! customized newsletters.andM;Early text applications, most based on text/database servers, include supporttools from Answer and Lysis, and a documentation generator from Solutron forresale by Index Technology.andP;  Finally there are application development tools,such as Syntactics' Crystal series, Deucalion's Tomahawk, both withinterfaces to standard relational databases, and Lotus Notes, with its ownproprietary textbase, All of them are exciting.andP;  They illustrate that thereare many powerful ways to manipulate text without actually &quot;understanding&quot; it-- whatever that means.andP;  Drudgery can be reduced, mistakes of carelessness oromission eliminated, layout decisions and item selection can be automated,text bases can be automatically restructured for efficiency.andP;  As withdatabase, people are starting to understand the difference betweeninterpretive tools, which let the user manipulate text, and developmenttools, which let users delegate work by building compiled applications.'andM;But before you proceed, a caveat.andP;  Computers don't (for now) understand text.andO;They process input and generate &quot;meaningful&quot; output only as the result ofcriteria, rules and processes defined by humans -- and only for humans toread.andP;  Responsible vendors remember to point out that none of these systemsdesign themselves: The layout rules must be carefully decided and expressed;the text-selection filters may need a lot of fine-tuning; template documentsand boilerplate must be properly constructed and wellworded; answers toquestions must be accurate and intelligible.andP;  These systems help to dothings, but they must still be put into action by smart, sentient humanbeings.andM;Here is a matrix of text applications (a hybrid of one used by Lotus and onewe published last June in an article on groupware):andM;structure reference database structured workflow managementandM;E-mail document generationandM;support databases static filtered dynamicandM;news feedandM;unfiltered E-mail conferencing news feed desktop publishingandM;no structureandM;In essence, the matrix describes the interplay between the structure of thedata and the power of the applications applied to it.andP;  (Hypertext publishingis not listed here because it can use -- or support -- almost any of theseapplications, and so it fits everywhere or nowhere.) The matrix doesn't makemuch distinction between whether the operation is done manually or by apowerful application, or whether it's accomplished on a client-server or asingle-system model.andP;  The advantage of client-server, of course, is the easeof sharing a single text base (and data model) across multiple users andapplications.andP;  The problem right now is that there is no single standard datamodel that everyone can use.andP;  Xanadu is proposing one standard, while Lotusis using its own proprietary model, which will be open but which the companyis too sensible to propose as a standard as yet.andP;  (A vendor can be open, butonly the marketplace can create a standard.andP;  And a standards committee canofficiate.)andM;One's man's client is another man's serverandM;Note also that &quot;client&quot; software need not sit on &quot;client&quot; hardware.andO;Frequently a &quot;client&quot; application will sit on the server, managing andmanipulating the text files for access by other client applications that areused by individuals at workstations.andP;  This turns the server hardware systeminto an application server rather than simply a database server.andP;  Then theclient application sitting on the hardware server will look like a serverapplication as far as the end-user applications are concerned.andP;  It'sconfusing, but this is the point of cooperative processing and peer-to-peerarchitectures.andM;XANADU Xanadu will probably reach its 20th anniversary just about the time itachieves its first commercial incarnation.andP;  Xanadu, of course, is more thanjust a product: It's a dream; it's a mission; is it a mirage?andM;The full vision isn't likely to be realized anytime soon, but Autodesk has ahabit of delivering real products, and it appears that at least the firstinstantiation of Xanadu is going to ship early in 1990.andP;  There are still acouple of technical challenges to handle, but they're questions ofperformance rather than feasibility.andP;  From Autodesk's point of view, thelong-term promise of Xanadu - -a worldwide publishing medium -- may or maynot be realized, but the system should be immediately useful as a means ofstoring and managing AutoCAD documentation and diagrams.andM;Xanadu Operating Company, the creation of Ted Nelson and implementer RogerGregory, is still an independent, 10-person operation.andP;  It has its ownoffices (with ample beanbags, Jolt cola and whiteboards) in Palo Alto 50miles south of Autodesk's Sausalito headquarters -- &quot;close enough that we candrive there when we have to,&quot; says Xanadu vp of software engineering MarcStiegler, &quot;but not so close that they visit all the time.&quot;andM;The back-endandM;That first product will be a back-end for storing and managing chunks of data-- text, image or anything else that can be stored digitally, and pointers tothings that can't be stored digitally.andP;  Xanadu provides access to any givenchunk across a network of user- or application-defined links and links builtby the system between versions or items split by the addition of new data.andO;Because links run from point to point rather than from chunk to chunk, linksare fine-grained even though chunks may be as large as entire books orgovernment proposals.andP;  Nothing is ever lost, although it may be archived.andO;Things are simply added and linked to earlier versions.andM;The algorithms by which this is accomplished are complex, clever -- andsecret.andP;  Stiegler, an aerospace systems designer hired after the Autodeskacquisition, says he's confident the algorithms will scale up -- but he'sless sure of what the performance of any size system will be after finetuningover the next few months.andP;  Underneath, Xanadu is based on lots of indexesthat float over the data, which is rarely moved once it is stored.andP;  We havebeen assured we could understand and believe in the technology in the spaceof six hours or so if we signed a non-disclosure.andP;  We may do so, and we'lllet you know.andP;  Meanwhile, we can only cite the evident faith of the folksfrom Autodesk as testimony to its value.andM;Xanadu allows the user (or application) to define arbitrary link types, suchas citation, cross-reference, endorsement, refutation, examples andproblemanswer, as well as node types (book, document, etc.).andP;  In addition,frontends can add executable routines, such as &quot;move-to,&quot; &quot;insert,&quot;&quot;replace,&quot; and &quot;execute,&quot; which would execute a subroutine rather thandisplay data.andP;  (Of course, the execute command could be to display aparticular kind of data.) Chunks could also contain -- or be -- objects.andM;Each time a data chunk is updated, Xanadu retains the previous version (tothe extent specified by the user or system administrator).andP;  Technically, itis the changes that are stored, but the effect for users is the same.andP;  Thisis the basis of a comparison feature which works, of course, only to theextent that the user works with an application that is a true Xanadufront-end - -that he stays within the system, so to speak.andP;  Otherwise Xanaduwill treat each new version of a document or image as a different one,without its old links.andP;  The advantage is that Xanadu can detect things thathave been moved around (rather than mistakenly perceiving additions anddeletions); the disadvantage is that it can't effectively compare twoindependent pieces of text (to detect plagiarism, for example, or compare twolawyers' contracts).andM;In the first release, Xanadu will be single-server, although the vision (seebelow) is ultimately to fill the world with connected servers so that allinformation will be accessible everywhere.andP;  The system (including the API)runs on Suns right now, but it has been rewritten in C for portability.andP;  Thefirst front-ends will be PCs and Macs as well as Suns.andM;The APIandM;The system includes an application programming interface that will allowdevelopers and users to make use of all its facilities.andP;  Most basic is theability to define, create and manipulate the typed links.andP;  As illustrated inA priori (page 11), an application could monitor the paths users took to getto a certain piece of information and then collapse those paths so userscould avoid the extra steps.andP;  You could run a text-search program against aportion of a textbase, and create index links for specified key words, or youcould link specified chunks to fields in a relational database throughpointers, and then have all the power of the database to assign attributesand manipulate and find sets of data chunks.andM;Sensors detect whenever someone links to a chunk, with comments or alternateversions, and can be assigned to notify the author or assigned owner; theoriginal version is always identified as such to all readers.andM;The front-endsandM;Xanadu sees its product as the back-end to word-processors and otherindividual productivity tools, but at least in the beginning it will likelybe used more as a storage and hypertext medium than as a general-purpose filesystem, if only because it's a more compelling as an environment for newapplications than as a file system that would require rewriting of old ones.andO;(And we're still skeptical about maintaining an audit trail of everythingthat ever happens.)andM;But eventually Xanadu applications, and textbase applications in general,should move beyond the current ones of storage and retrieval to more activemanipulation.andP;  Xanadu will produce its own, a group-editing tool we believe,positioned consciously after MacPaint and MacWrite as an entry-level tool.andO;Xanadu's goal is for it to make the system immediately useful and todemonstrate its possibilities without much limiting the opportunities open todevelopers.andM;Payment systems will be one key front-end applications, resident on theservers and managed by whoever owns the server/service.andP;  As an author, youmay charge readers for that privilege, probably through some clearinghouse,or you may simply want to know, so that you can refute comments, elaborate onthem or simply know what context your work is appearing in.andM;Other possible applications include almost anything you can do with text orimages: document generation and workflow, documentation management, knowledgebase management for such activities as user support, on-line corporateprocedures and policy, and selection, editing and dissemination ofinformation of all kinds.andM;The vision: hypertext publishingandM;For example, suggests Mark Miller, a longtime member (the proper term) ofXanadu and also formerly with PARC, there's the whole field of hypertextpublishing.andP;  The goal, says Eric Drexler, linked to the project for the lastten years, is to have a database of &quot;99 percent rubbish that appears to be 99percent gold.&quot; At this point, we do what would be much easier if this were ahypertext publication, and refer you to Drexler's unpublished paper,&quot;Hypertext publishing and the evolution of knowledge&quot; (see Resources, page25).andP;  The paper covers the potential and the problems of hypertext publishingat length.andP;  But the garbage issue bears redundant quoting here:andM;&quot;An open publishing medium with links presents a major problem: garbage.andP;  Ifanyone can comment on anything, important works will become targets forhundreds or thousands of links, most...worthless or redundant.andP;  A [nunfiltered] hypertext system would become worthless precisely where itscontent is most interesting.andP;  To deal with this problem, authors must haveexclusive rights to unique names, so readers can use those names asindicators of quality.andP;  Readers must be able [yea, encouraged] to rate whatthey read, so that their judgments can aid later readers' choices....&quot;andM;The vital obverse of hypertext's ability to make texts widely available isthe ability of applications to let people cull the one percent of thatbroader base that is of interest or value to them.andP;  This is entirelyfeasible, just as it now happens with printed publications, where thedifficulty of getting published and distributed serves to keep out much ofthe junk, and individuals' own junk-detectors keep out the rest.andP;  (SeeAnterior Technology, page 10.) But it could happen much faster, and moreeffectively.andM;It will happen by means of filtering typed links.andP;  Those typed links, forexample, could have both values and payments associated with them.andP;  Just aseditors now select or commission articles and assemble them for readers, socould hypertext editors.andP;  Users could select from such assemblies.andP;  Butthere's more.andP;  Many people may not want to be editors, but might have strongand valuable opinions on what they read.andP;  Want a selection of what appeals toHenry Kissinger? Or Oprah Winfrey? Although privacy can be protected, Winfreymight be willing to let you in on her choices for a small fee.andM;On a more mass basis, readers in general could have the option to &quot;vote&quot; onwhat they have read.andP;  Other readers could ask for articles rated highly byfellow boat enthusiasts, or by single parents, or other demographicbreakdowns.andP;  How will the money change hands? That's one of the issues thathas not been worked out on a large-scale basis -- either by Xanadu or bysociety overall.andP;  But on a local basis, it can work any way the aXanadu-based service provider cares to build it using the Xanadu API.andP;  Withina community, for example, some editors' judgments would be more highly prizedand the editor could raise prices as he pleased; other editors might go outof business.andP;  People could publish their work for free or charge for it, asthey please.andP;  The goal of all this is to provide some way for people tofilter the huge amount of information that will be available but notnecessarily worthwhile.andM;Other benefits include automatic access to a writers' sources, to refutationsof novel ideas, and so forth.andP;  Quotes could be reviewed in context, ratherthan with only the quoter's spin.andP;  Easy access to old stuff would discouragerepetition and possibly even encourage original new stuff.andM;Dividing the spoilsandM;As usual, practice precedes policy and laws.andP;  Intellectual property issueswill proliferate in the years ahead: What is fair use? Who gets paid forcompilations of published materials? What rights do authors have to maintainthe integrity of their work? What notice is required when Juan criticizesAlice's work? Must she pay to read his attack? Most customers won't pay toread her rebuttal, or does Juan have to subsidize it? What's the charge for asearch that yields no results yet taxes system resources?andM;The vision: Dream or nightmare?andM;So what will all this feel like? Most of us are already suffering from toomuch information.andP;  Do we really want access to more, however well filtered?andO;Will filtering prevent us from encountering new ideas? Will literature becomethe mere patching together of old text? How do new writers make a name forthemselves?andM;As before, people will still write, and edit, and select.andP;  But by the timeyou see a Letter to the Editor, how often do you remember the article itreferences? Technology will make all these processes easier.andP;  Rather thanrepeat someone's argument, you can point to it -- whether to refute it,amplify it, or simply cite it with approval.andP;  In fact, technology does changethings.andP;  we will have the opportunity with hypertext publishing to become avastly better informed society.andP;  Good ideas should reach acceptance, and badideas rejection, more quickly, with a quick, free flow of propositions,corollaries and counterarguments.andP;  What automation and databases and airexpress did for business, speeding up the cycles and increasing the overalllevel of efficiency (because many laggards disappear), networks and hypertextpublishing may well do for thoughts and ideas.andM;Moreover, Ted Nelson's and Xanadu's wildest dreams to the contrary, hypertextpublishing need not be a global effort to provide rewards.andP;  On a commercialbasis, hypertext servers can increase communication and consistency ofpolicies and information within a company, with beneficial results.andP;  On asocietal basis, Drexler's and Miller's vision is that hypertext publishingwill start as a practical but still scholarly medium, an extension of theInternet, say, for thinkers who can refine their ideas by sharing them andgetting quick feedback.andP;  By searching indexes, you can avoid repeatingothers' ideas, and spend your time on something new.andP;  Which is why we nowrefer you again to Drexler's paper....andM;HYPERTEXT PUBLISHING: FIRST STEPSandM;Hypertext publishing isn't as far-off as it sounds.andP;  Aside from the threeservices described below, one early example of this kind of thing is themass-voting scheme of the Zagats, whose restaurant guide business has nowgrown to encompass hotels and theatrical productions.andP;  These are not online,but come out in the form of guidebooks and, most recently, a list publishedin New York Magazine.andP;  But the principle of consumer voting is clearlygaining ascendancy.andP;  Meanwhile, the restaurant guides published by Agendawareas Lotus Agenda files could easily be turned to such a purpose, as customersbuy them and add and share their own ratings with friends.andM;COMPUTER FOCUS: THE ONE TO READ WHEN YOU ONLY HAVE TIME FOR ONEandM;In partial fulfillment of the hypertext publishing dream, PinpointInformation Corp.andP;  of Chantilly, VA, has just launched Computer Focus.andP;  Thisis the proverbial personally tailored daily newsletter, focusing on thecomputer industry, for $2100 per year (but a mere $1800 for chartersubscribers).andM;As some Release 1.0 readers may recognize, this service is akin to one we ran-- and shut down - -some years ago, Computer Industry Daily.andP;  But there areso many differences that Computer Focus may succeed where we failed.andP;  Forstarters, CF is delivering by fax -- something hardly conceivable four yearsago but routine today.andP;  &quot;We've never come across a prospect without a faxmachine,&quot; says CF sales manager Jeff Goldman.andM;The basic benefit -- lacking in CID's less-tailored, less-comprehensiveservice -- is the certainty that you didn't miss something on page 35 ofWidget Weekly that could have changed your life -- or your posture on a deal.andO;The service is an amalgamation of article abstracts from 120 publications(identified by source); puff-removed, value-added press release rewrites; andoriginal reporting by staff and stringers.andP;  With fax delivery (vs.andP;  CID's useof MCI Mail hard-copy delivery), CF finishes its editorial day at 8 pm,letting it compete respectably with other dailies on important breaking news.andM;The nine (growing to 15) staff people who prepare the articles assign keywords to them.andP;  These low-level key words -- individual product names,company names, etc.andP;  -- are the leaves of a massive 70,000-term hierarchyrepresenting the computer industry, developed and maintained by CFspecialists.andP;  Customers are interviewed by Pinpoint's telemarketers todetermine their interest profile (usually using terms higher up in thehierarchy) and priorities.andP;  For example, &quot;Macintosh&quot; would belong tocategories such as Apple and personal computers; &quot;semiconductors&quot; wouldinclude a long list of companies and terms such as RAM, microprocessor,surface-mount technology and chip.andM;Pinpoint's inhouse search engine matches subscriber profiles against the keywords in each day's selection of 100 to 150 stories on a 386 and assemblesthe articles selected for each customer in an order determined by hispriorities.andP;  Each individual copy is then laid out on a pc for delivery byfax.andP;  &quot;We were concerned that people with few topics and low flow would findit low-value, but in fact it means they're getting exactly what they need,&quot;says Goldman.andP;  Those with lots of topics selected get only headlines whennecessary to make it all fit in six pages.andP;  They can order full text of anyarticle of interest, with appropriate royalties to the original publisher.andM;&quot;We follow carefully the legal guidelines for abstracting, i.e.andP;  you can'tquote more than one-twelfth of a given story, but you can paraphrase,&quot; notesco-founder and publisher Harvey Golomb.andP;  This is one of those practices thatmay come into question as hypertext publishing grows -- and as paymentmechanisms become more fine-grained, more efficient and more pervasive.andM;The primary benefit is productivity, says the company.andP;  It has determinedthat the typical target subscriber spends five to six hours a week readingtrade publications (four alone per month on Release 1.0?), while ComputerFocus takes only five minutes a day.. .but not if you then refer to the fulltext of stories of interest, either from the pile on your floor or throughCF's reprint service.andM;We suspect the ultimate determinant of CF's success will be editorialquality, unless CF can grow fast enough to drop its price to newspaper (notnewsletter) level quickly.andP;  It's nice to have a news service tailored to yourneeds, but not $2100-nice for most people.andP;  One of CID's weaknesses was itslack of focus, which CF has solved, but another was that it didn't offeranything you couldn't get elsewhere for less money.andP;  It did have uniquestories, as Computer Focus will, but quantity of stories is just whatcustomers are trying to avoid -- unless they stories are trulygroundbreaking.andP;  And what hotshot reporter wants to write for alimited-circulation publication? This lack of critical mass is the dilemma wefaced and that CF  faces.andM;For all that, Computer Focus is clearly the kind of service that will serveus all by 1995; the only question is whether it will belong to co-foundersGolomb, Jim Rutt (formerly with the Source and Business Research Corp.) andMike Walsh (also BRC), or to some existing publisher who knows how to sellenough ads to fund such a venture.andP;  No-ads is great, but a price below $400is even better.andM;&quot;This vehicle won't see ads,&quot; says Golomb, who sold his chain of stores toBusinessland in 1983 and has been an entrepreneur since.andP;  &quot;We hope to get tobreakeven within a year [although it has VC funding to last well beyond thatpoint], and then we might launch another one with ads.andP;  We've already had acouple of approaches concerning ads.andP;  But you have an inherent scarceresource with fax, which is the number of pages: What you sell, you don'twant to sell much of.&quot;andM;The company has been in business in start-up mode since April 1988, and isjust now launching a direct-mail campaign.andP;  (Check your mail)andM;INDIVIDUAL'S FIRST? UNTOUCHED BY HUMAN HANDSandM;Individual Inc., a company funded and advised in part by Ed Fredkin ofReliable Water fame (see Release 1.0, 89-6), is a few months behind Pinpointin going commercial with a similar but differently structured system.andO;Individual's First! is designed to be much more automated than ComputerFocus, from its reuse of text to its indexing techniques and its clientprofiles.andM;While Computer Focus seems to be selling mostly to individuals, Individual(oddly, considering the name) envisions its service as a departmentalresource -- hence the emphasis on automated profiling and a focus onmulticopy discounts.andP;  Pricing is $1995 per profile per site per year, plusabout $1 per person per month, and discounts on additional profiles.andP;  Whilethe CF profiles are a short list of interests expanded through synonyms andhierarchies into a set of terms matched against key words created by humanabstracters and classifiers, Individual runs its searches against the fulltext of a much larger number of stories untouched by human hands.andM;To build the profiles, Individual starts with templates for industry andfunctional areas (disk drives, spreadsheets, Randamp;D, financial) that wereinitially constructed by hand but that will be refined automatically withuser feedback.andP;  The technique is similarity ranking, using techniquesdeveloped by Cornell's Gerard Salton, who sits on Individual's advisoryboard.andP;  These techniques are also the basis of Third Eye's Elexir software,and are described in full in Release 1.0, 88-1.andP;  In short, they allowIndividual to ask customers which stories were most appropriate, and use allthe words in those stories as the basis of further queries, appropriatelyweighted.andP;  That is, each word is assessed on its relative frequency, so thatonly words that appear much more frequently in the sample good story thanthey do in the entire database will be used to construct the query.andP;  Location-- headline vs.andP;  body, topic sentence vs.andP;  last paragraph -- counts too.andM;Individual gets its news text straight off the newswires, with no abstractingor hand-indexing, for which it pays redistribution royalties to PR Newswire,Business Wire and McGraw-Hill News.andP;  It automatically scans 1500 or morestories a day on behalf of its clients, although many of them may beredundant across services or updates of earlier items.andM;Individual's software runs on a combination of Suns for indexing andsearching, and pcs for data capture and generation of each customer'sindividual newspaper as specified by the software on the Sun.andP;  One Sun canhandle approximately 750 customers, and one pc can handle 100, so the systemcan grow incrementally, while Pinpoint would have to add abstracters to covernew industries.andP;  Individual's next offering will be CBD Express, dailyclippings from Commerce Business Daily, the daily 50-page listing ofgovernment bids and contract awards that is virtually impossible to scan byeye.andP;  This service will cost subscribers $1000 to $2000 annually; it willcost Individual the price of a daily tape from the government, since theinformation itself is public-domain.andM;ANTERIOR TECHNOLOGY'S IN MODERATION: MUCH TOUCHED BY HUMAN MINDSandM;Flexing the hypertext publishing filter in a different way is AnteriorTechnology of Menlo Park, which is about to provide a junk-detector servicecalled the In Moderation Network.andP;  It so happens that this service isperformed by people, but it's just a foretaste of what we'll someday beprogramming agents to do.andP;  (We read a remarkably wrong-headed article on theservice in the San Jose Mercury, raising fears of censorship, etc.andP;  Thisservice is a form of editing, much like what they do at the Merc, except thatfor now content is merely selected rather than modified.andP;  Whole messages areeither used or left out; if used, their entire contents are kept intact.)andM;In Moderation, for now, will provide selected messages from discussion forumson the Internet and USENET.andP;  This is not an automated topic-selection serviceso much as a garbage-collection and fluff-removal service: It will take outthe &quot;toxic waste of included text, personal attacks, overstuffed armchairpostulations, conjectures and speculations [and] function as a sewagetreatment plant,&quot; says founder Geoff Goodfellow.andP;  A former principalinvestigator of computer security and networking at SRI (1974-1986) andcoauthor of &quot;The Hacker's Dictionary,&quot; he estimates the shrinkage at 80 to 90percent.andP;  (His hope is that the very existence of his service will drive thereal flamers away or induce them to clean up their act.andP;  Good luck!)andM;He has already signed up a number of moderators for such interest areas asprotocols, Mac, IBM PCs, UNIX, telecommunications, logic programming,computer architecture, video technology, legal issues, and comic books andscience fiction.andP;  Their compensation will reflect the popularity of thediscussions they moderate, says Goodfellow.andP;  For now there's only onemoderator per topic, but that could change, and users could pick the onewhose choices they liked better.andM;Charges to the readers, subject to modification as the system matures, startat $60 per month per site; Hewlett-Packard in Palo Alto would count as onesite, H-P in Cupertino as another.andP;  Individuals will pay around $10 permonth.andP;  Goodfellow is also considering wholesaling the moderated discussionsto other networks such as MCI bulletin boards, The Portal and the Well, aservice sponsored by The Point Foundation (a/k/a Stewart Brand).andP;  The sourcematerial on Internet and USENET is public-domain, but Goodfellow is putting acompilation copyright on the In Moderation output, and users' contractscarefully restrict their redistribution rights.andM;In Moderation users' responses to the system will be limited to the InModeration system by default, says Goodfellow, who is evidently hoping tocreate a higher-class paid service.andP;  (Of course, any subscriber can get fullInternet or USENET by logging on the regular way.) But this exclusivity mightend up isolating the In Moderation service from the general one to anexcessive degree.andP;  Non-customers might provide useful feedback to customers'comments if only they had access.andP;  On the other hand, what happens if an InModeration customer's responses are rubbish? It will be fun to watch as thesequestions and many others arise in a system that's a foretaste of aninevitable movement.andM;ALIEVIATING THE HEARTBREAK OF SERVICE AND SUPPORT: ANSWER AND LYSISandM;While they're no guarantor of success, service and support will becomeprimary differentiators as products and services become more complex andtaskspecific.andP;  There are now ways to automate support at least partially --and the vendors who do so effectively will have important advantages inconsistency, reliability, coverage and cost over their competitors.andP;  Theirproducts will be more useful by definition, because well-supported customerswill be better able to use them.andM;The implications for a vendor using such systems are exciting.andP;  Customers'questions can be answered more quickly and more consistently, saving time andenhancing customer relationships.andP;  This applies not just to computercompanies but to vendors of everything from chemicals and engines toinsurance policies, magazine subscriptions and travel services.andP;  In somebusinesses, support can bring in a third or more of revenues at low marginalcost.andP;  With automation the the job may be more pleasant.andP;  Happier customerslead to happier support people, which means less turnover and less trainingcost.andP;  And training should be easier when the information is easier to find.andM;Of course no system is foolproof.andP;  Sometimes a customer may ask a question insuch a way that it's hard for the support person to find the right match --or it might be such a tough question that it stumps even the specialist.andO;Moreover, if the product is truly terrible, good support can't make up forit.andP;  Finally, like most automated systems, these help systems automate onlythe relatively easy, routine tasks such as locating and sharing answers.andP;  Butthat lets people concentrate on the really hard stuff -- figuring out answersto new questions and beingnice to obnoxious customers with old questions whodon't bother to read the manual.andM;User-friendliness can go only so far.andP;  Simple tasks can be automated, andcomplex systems can be made easier to use or fix, but ultimately the best wayto make a complex product easy to use is to support it -- with real, livepeople who know what they're doing.andP;  These people are hard to get, hard totrain, and hard to keep.andM;And they're invaluable.andP;  In a small support group, everyone knows all theproblems, and difficult problems are handed to the topic expert.andP;  The supportgroup quickly gets a feel for the most common problems, and can recite theanswers almost by rote.andP;  Moreover, they can quickly understand what theproblem is: Customers may think it's the software when in fact it's thehardware (and it's rarely the product whose vendor they're calling!).andO;Nonetheless, you'd really like to be a friend to your customers (yes, it willpay off?), and so you'll help them regardless.andM;How do you maintain that illusion of knowing everything when there's so muchto know that a single small, well-connected group can't handle all of thecalls and all of the questions? Work has to be parceled out.andP;  What's toreplace the daily updates at the water cooler and over beers after work? Howcan you ease the learning process and let novices share the common knowledgeof experienced support people, and let experienced people share new problemsand solutions?andM;The answer, of course, is a shared knowledge base.andP;  And that's what you findin lots of places.andP;  The simplest shared knowledge base is the traditionalcollection of manuals, looseleaf binders with loose or missing leaves, onlinetext files accessible by keywords or indexes and tables of contents, buglistings, updates, bulletins, cafeteria conversations on the dumbestquestions everyone has heard lately, -- and so forth.andP;  The buzzword answer ishypertext -- a textbase full of cross-references that lead directly to theright answer.andP;  The problem is that hypertext is a result, not a tool.andP;  Howdid all those links get in there? Who's going to change them when the companyannounces a new product, when a customer discovers a new bug, when a thirdcompany announces a complementary product that works with yours -- but notquite seamlessly?andM;Answer serversandM;Two companies providing software to help automate the creation, operation andupdating of support knowledge bases are Lysis Corp. of Atlanta, with SupportInformation System, and Answer Corp.andP;  of San Jose, with A priori.andP;  Bothcompanies sell software packages for customer support organizations, startingat about $5,000 per seat (plus hardware).andP;  These packages manage databases oftypical customer questions and appropriate answers for retrieval by internalcustomer support staff answering phone calls.andP;  Of course, as Lysis founderand president Deborah Fain notes, &quot;There may be 50 ways to ask a questionthat all need the same answer.&quot; The support reps match the customer questionsto questions already in the database using key words, indexes, and othertechniques to narrow the search, and the database displays the correctanswer.andM;Unlike other support systems, they not only provide support information tosupport people, but they get more efficient as they do so.andP;  The informationin the answers initially may come directly from the vendor's manuals, but thedatabases grow as they are used.andP;  If a customer question is new (or so wordedthat it's not recognizable) the question is kicked upstairs over the networkto a product specialist who either answers it or matches it to an existingquestion.andP;  That answer is now available to any support person using thesystem.andP;  At first, the customer sees no difference: He calls in and getssomeone on the line who promises to help him.andP;  But that person is likely tobe better informed.andM;Lysis already has some customers, including Manpower Corporation, which isusing SIS to support its own personnel out in the field as well as someclient staff as they use a variety of vendors' software.andP;  Lysis emphasizesbreadth of coverage (lots of products on lots of platforms, like Manpower)and simple questions.andP;  &quot;In fact,&quot; says Fain, &quot;we see a big market outside thesoftware business, in highly competitive mature industries where customersupport is the only differentiator.andP;  We're talking to a valve company rightnow...&quot; Lysis is also promoting SIS as a system vendors can resell to VARs tosupport the VARs' customers using the vendors' products, hardware orsoftware.andP;  Ultimately, of course, there's no reason it couldn't go tocustomer sites, or travel around in a salesperson's laptop.andP;  The softwareitself fits into a 640K DOS pc; storage requirements depend on the quantityof questions and answers.andP;  (High-end SIS systems can use a VAX server.)andM;A start-up with $1.25 million in funding from Alpha Partners, Answer Corp.andO;is just now putting finishing touches on its A priori system, which runs onSun workstations and is targeted to high-end software and hardware vendors --the kind who already have Suns.andP;  Answer's first customer is Interleaf, soonto use a test version to support users of its Technical Publishing Systemsoftware.andP;  &quot;The only question was who would get it first -- us or ourcompetitors,&quot; says Bill Grossman, vp of operations at Interleaf.andP;  Answer'sedge is its automatic learning capability, which makes it ideal forexpensive, complex products that come in many versions and configurations.andO;Lysis's Fain comes from the PC business while Answer co-founders Tom Evansand Louise Kirkbride were in engineering.andM;The detailsandM;Both systems accomplish more or less the same task, and both vendors stressthat they're not &quot;expert systems,&quot; but systems that provide easy access toexpertise.andP;  In broad terms, both begin with a database of answers.andP;  With theLysis system, support reps &quot;capture&quot; new answers, and then &quot;guide&quot; them, orassign them by hand to appropriate categories for access by other supportreps.andP;  (Lysis prefers to keep further details proprietary, and some of thevagueness in our description of A priori is intentional, alas!)andM;Answer's A priori is more automated; the genius of the system is to make itsimprovement an automatic by-product of its use rather than a separate,tedious activity.andP;  The first screen the support person sees allows him topick from a broad support area, and lists the most common problems in thatarea for, say, the last three weeks, as shown on the next two pages.andP;  (Allthese parameters are adjustable by the system administrator.) As the supportreps enter the problems they encounter (with short titles) or match them withexisting problem statements, the system records their actions for use inestablishing the hierarchies and links that make A priori's database souseful.andP;  When a problem appears to have no ready answer, it is routed to thedomain specialist responsible for that area (who could be another supportperson with a specialty, a support specialist, or even the engineer whodesigned the product).andP;  He replies into the system, and that answer is postedas the solution to that problem, for all to see.andM;As shown, a single answer may be accessible in response to a variety ofproblems and by several paths.andP;  Ultimately, those that get used mostfrequently will bubble up to the top, just the way you might keep a cribsheet on your desk, a manual on the shelf and a full-blown reference work inthe department library.andP;  Rarely encountered problems and solutions sink tothe bottom -- and can be removed following support-group policy.andP;  (Theanswers, however, will generally remain just in case someone wants themsomeday.)andM;A priori also keeps customer records -- which products and which people aresupported for each customer -- and data for management to monitor how long ittakes to resolve questions, which modules of a product are most confusing orbuggy, parameters of employee performance and other useful data.andM;The structure is the dataandM;Sounds incredibly simple, but how does it happen? The initial set of answersgenerally gets into the system as text files that are chunked into &quot;answers&quot;and classified by the words in their headings.andP;  If the vendor already hasdocumentation on line, so much the better.andP;  Otherwise, it can be scanned andOCRed.andP;  The system administrator then spends some time developing automatedroutines to build pointers and titles for the text chunks.andP;  Although A prioriitself doesn't support it, a topic specialist could also use text-search or aproduct such as IZE in building the index pointers to the answers.andM;Organize yourself!andM;Thus the initial set-up of the database determines its immediate usefulness,but it is self-correcting -- or self-enhancing, depending where you startedfrom).andP;  It is yet another example of the self-organizing systems we discussedin the June issue of Release 1.0.andM;A priori keeps its data in tables that store short texts of problems andanswers (with pointers to the actual answers which may include drawings,source code for patches or anything else), customer records, usage data, andthe links among them built by hand and as a result of the usage data.andP;  (Bycontrast, Lysis's SIS is basically flat text files riddled with pointers.) Apriori also contains code modules -- call them agents -- which monitoractivity on the system.andP;  At a specified time (overnight works well), theycollect the usage data and reconfigure the system's apparent structure byrerouting the links to reflect that usage.andP;  They create direct links toreplace users' roundabout paths and the system updates itself automaticallyas a by-product of the support process, rather than as a chore no one takeson.andP;  (Although this is a client-server system, the client applications thatmanage this process physically run on the server.andP;  Other client applicationsthat manage user interaction with the system run on workstations.)andM;A priori makes most sense where there are complex products that come in manyversions, with a solution set too broad to be known thoroughly by any singleperson.andP;  That means software and complex capital equipment (which probablyhas a fairly high software component).andP;  A high proportion of such vendorshave Suns for A priori to run on, says Answer co-founder Louise Kirkbride,who previously founded a company called Cadri that resold time on CADmachines.andP;  Her unsatisfactory experiences with the CAD vendor's support ledto Answer Corp.andP;  Her co-founder Tom Evans, former vp of customer support atTektronix, literally wrote the book on software support; its title is &quot;TheSoftware Support Handbook.&quot;andM;As it happens, A priori's relational database was built in-house by Answer'sthird co-founder, Rick Gifford, because he couldn't find one to suit.andP;  Wefigure one such as Interbase, optimized for handling text, would work well insuch an application and provide nearly automatic portability and continuingenhancements.andP;  In a few years, an object-oriented database would beappropriate.andP;  You could probably build a similar system around Notes insteadof around a traditional relational database.andP;  Notes would probably give youfiner-grained control over the appearance and arrangement of the answers,whereas A priori treats them as discrete, ugly chunks.andP;  Either approach wouldwork, with Notes likely to appeal in environments with less technical people-- both because of its choice of platform (OS/2 server, DOS/windows clients)and its attention to display and formatting.andP;  Also, Notes is a lot moreflexible -- but would require a lot more work to build a full system such asA priori.andP;  For a company doing high-level technical support, A priori is apre-invented wheel; for a company that wants to integrate support with otherforms of customer tracking, Notes is a flexible toolkit of spokes and rims.andM;THE HEARTBREAK OF DOCUMENTAT-ON: SOLUTRON/INDEX'S XL/DOCandM;Index Technology is widely regarded as the Ashton-Tate of the CASE world: Fewpeople consider its Excelerator CASE tool to have the best technology, butits openness to third parties and its sales force combine to make it the mostsuccessful company in the field, (However, Index is avoiding some of theproblems now besetting Ashton-Tate by totally rewriting its five-yearoldproduct to ship in 1990 -- a feat that took A-T almost nine years.)andM;A case in point is Index's recent announcement that it will be remarketing aproduct called XL/Doc from Solutron of Alameda, CA.andP;  XL/Doc is adocumentation generator, sort of a report generator that uses information inExcelerator's data dictionary to generate documentation, code frames andother useful texts automatically.andP;  (Mind you, this documentation is nothinglike a user's manual, which should be written with wit and vision; it's morelike a bill-of-materials for code modules with some extra information on whatthe materials are for.andP;  But the text files it generates can be used as thebasis of something more readable.) It runs on a PC with DOS, the standardExcelerator environment.andP;  It's a client to the Excelerator database server;because it deals with Excelerator files rather than coexists with Exceleratoritself, there's no need for multi-tasking or a more capacious platform,andM;While the analysts and designers do their work, they create huge bodies ofknowledge which XL/Doc can mine for conversion into other useful forms.andO;While XL/Doc could be handy for almost anyone, its most immediate applicationwill be for benighted government contractors struggling to meet the DefenseDepartment's 2167A standard, a detailed specification for documentation, downto how paragraphs are numbered.andP;  (Solutron's people come out of the real-time-- read military -- systems business.) The spec requires certain informationin certain order, including code descriptions, crossreferences betweenrequirements and specs and code, and many other details.andM;When the government promulgates such specific rules, it's excruciating forpeople to create the documents by hand, let alone carry them around.andP;  Butit's relatively easy to code the rules to generate documents that conform.andO;They may not have much originality, and they may not be easy to read, but youcan be sure they meet specs.andP;  As long as the target system has been designedaccording to the rules, with proper citation of what each code module doesand how it relates both to other modules and the system requirements andspecifications, XL/Doc can pull out the information to assemble anappropriate document.andP;  This works, of course, only to the extent that theproper information is in the dictionary in the first place.andP;  XL/Doc willnotify you if it's missing, but doesn't notice if it's incorrect.andM;For regular folks, tooandM;But there's more to it than just meeting military requirements.andP;  Even forcommercial endeavors, it's handy to know what's in a system, especially ifmany people designed it and many others will use and enhance it.andM;The bulk of the smarts in XL/Doc is its specific knowledge of the structuresin the Excelerator data dictionary and their relationships (and Solutron hasan exclusive relationship with Index for this market).andP;  The Excelerator datadictionary isn't a simple set of tables, but rather a complex set ofhierarchies, interdependencies among modules and links to diagrams and blocksof text that illustrate or comment on the data and code elements, which maybe used in original or modified form in many places.andP;  There are datadefinitions and control flows, branches and loops.andP;  (This is why Index isrewriting the whole product, currently reliant on C-Tree, using Ontologic'sVbase object-oriented database.)andM;This &quot;understanding&quot; of the Excelerator structures gives XL/Doc greatflexibility.andP;  For example, it can describe and cross-reference the variouscomponents of a flow chart and the subtasks within it, It can refer properlyto data elements in the many sections of a program that use them.andM;And it can do all this in the order prescribed by the government, or in theorder specified by a user in Solutron's script language, a sort of SQL forthe data structures in the Excelerator dictionary.andP;  The user could alsospecify the structure of the documentation: data definitions first, then aflow chart, and then descriptions and requirementsanalyses for each item onthe flow chart, properly cross-referenced.andP;  Thus, he can run the samedocument structure against a variety of software systems, or he can get avariety of reports for a single system.andP;  For example, the same extraction andconstruction techniques can be used to generate code frames from specs,color-by-number units for programmers, They include the data definitions,titles, comments and other non-code elements that surround code, so that aprogrammer need write only the bare code itself.andM;More examples: Information Resources' exception reporting...andM;Another example, but with a less rigid rule-set, is an exception-reportingsystem, Coverstory, that's part of Information Resources' data-analysistools.andP;  About six high-end customers (e.g.andP;  Ocean Spray, Cadbury-Schweppes)are currently using a pilot version of the system, which uses expert systems,trend analysis and other techniques to monitor vast flows of brandedgoodspurchase data for unusual patterns.andP;  Rather than produce print-outs orcryptic listings, the system dumps its data into templates; sentencestructures vary randomly.andP;  It loads the resulting documents into Ventura toproduce memos of highlights - -&quot;Price war breaks out,&quot; &quot;Alice's restaurantshare is up&quot; -- formatted according to some simple rules complete withbullets, headlines and charts.andP;  (You can get the reports in ASCII if youdon't want to spring for Ventura, but the format rules work with Venturaonly.)andM;...and KnowledgePoint's Personnel Policy ExpertandM;KnowledgePoint uses an expert system (First-Class) to drive a documentgenerator that produces personnel policy manuals.andP;  Personnel Policy Expert isan example of the publishing medium of the future: It contains all theknowledge of an extensive reference manual with twice-yearly updates, and itlets users automatically generate manuals in accord with the policies theyselect in response to questions and accompanying explanations.andP;  Aside fromthe ease of producing and regularly updating manuals, users get an educationas they go through the process of building the manual.andP;  They are askedquestions that they may not have thought about, and can read backgroundmaterial before they make the choices that will be incorporated in themanual, which is basically cleverly assembled and cross-referencedboilerplate with user parameters.andP;  The system costs only $495 plus $95yearly, because costs are spread across a growing base of 2000 customers.andM;BUILD IT YOURSELF: TEXT APPLICATION TOOLSandM;By contrast with the applications above, the smarts in the tools below aremore general.andP;  The Crystal series and Deucalion's Tomahawk both work withmost SQL databases, and can be used to build documents incorporating a widevariety of data.andP;  Crystal Production Mode can even change a document'sstructure depending on the data it encounters; in fact, you could probablyuse it to build something along the lines of XL/Doc.andP;  But for all that, whatCrystal and Tomahawk do is produce documents and pages.andP;  Period.andP;  LotusNotes, by contrast, can do a wide variety of things to and with text, but itrelies on its own proprietary text database.andM;SYNTACTICS' CRYSTAL SERIESandM;Syntactics is a longtime UNIX office automation software vendor now expandinginto DOS and beyond the basic word-processor.andP;  Its Crystal DocumentManagement System runs on DOS as well as UNIX and lets you pull database datainto a document to create everything from dunning letters or sweepstakesinvitations (&quot;Yes, EDventure, you may already have won! Imagine a brightshiny Ferrari Testosterone outside the Holdings family home ....&quot;).andM;While the design center of XL/Doc is creation of variously structureddocuments from a large, highly structured database, Crystal DocumentManagement System is optimized for creating a large number of similardocuments where the data but not the document structure varies.andP;  It'sbasically a powerful document-processor with mail-merge facilities that canpaginate and lay out the resulting documents correctly.andP;  That is, rather thanan actual layout, you give it design rules through a menu, so that, forexample, you don't end up with the &quot;Sincerely&quot; on one page and space for thesignature on the last page.andP;  (The command is &quot;keep,&quot; which will keepdesignated text objects or number of lines together.) DMS can also easilyincorporate user insertions and is oriented to a user who is preparingdocuments at the keyboard.andM;Syntactics is about to announce a follow-on product (code-named CrystalProduction Mode) oriented towards mass production of documents such as wills,employee benefits reports, realty listings, personalized insurance policiesand configuration-specific documentation.andP;  The person creating the documenttemplates is probably not the one running Crystal P-Mode, which is a powerfulapplication-development tool targeted towards VARs and MIS rather than aninteractive document-preparation system.andP;  It includes a language that canidentify and select text objects and a command language to arrange them, anduses DMS as its formatting engine.andP;  While DMS treats data as data, CrystalP-Mode can use imported data as parameters for commands.andP;  For example, youcould express rules such as these, in more formal language: &quot;Count the numberof items and insert that number (spelled out) in the phrase 'the following -items'...&quot; or &quot;If sex = female, use she; otherwise, use he&quot; in designatedplaces.andP;  Crystal P-Mode can also easily incorporate tables (properlypositioned and with headings repeated if a table spills over to additionalpages), lists with bullets or numbers, and other complex structures.andM;Crystal P-Mode can be used in two styles: where the user sits inside thetext-processor and mass-produces documents, as in mail-merge or documentassembly, and a mode closer to XL/Doc where the user or application ismanipulating data and can produce formatted documents as required.andP;  Forexample, a single database application might use any of a number of Crystaldocuments, according to the data -- report card, notice to parents, letter tocollege admissions officer, letter to truant officer; or first notice, secondnotice, final warning, cement shoes requisition, letter to next of kin,insurance form fill-in.andP;  Other examples would include tasks such asgenerating a will by assembling the appropriate chunks of text with theblanks correctly filled in, where the system builds the proper documentstructure as determined by the data.andP;  In essence, the first mode is orientedto massproduction of one document for many records, whereas the second modeallows many documents from each record.andM;Crystal DMS runs on UNIX and DOS, while the newer product requires a UNIXenvironment for all its capabilities.andP;  Founder Erwin Morton stresses theopenness of Crystal P-Mode: Developer/users can modify the language to addtheir own commands or subroutines, and it can drive PostScript systems aswell as letter printers.andP;  However, it is targeted to office environments, notto high-end publishing operations.andP;  That's the province of Deucalion'sTomahawk, described below.andM;DEUCALION'S TOMAHAWKandM;Deucalion Resources Group, a longtime custom developer in the electronicpublishing business, decided in 1987 to build and sell a tool for resale sothat the company could leverage its knowledge while retaining its character --15 people in a large gabled townhouse in Ann Arbor.andP;  The tool, Tomahawk, isnow in its beta release, and customers such as printer R.R.andP;  Donnelley andnewspaper-system supplier CText are using it to add enhanced compositionmodules to their publishing systems.andM;Basically, Tomahawk is a language and data structure and objects forcomposition applications, or T/Ware', written in Deucalion's T language (withthe syntax of C).andP;  It uses VAX servers and pc-based front-ends, although it'sfairly portable at customer request.andP;  Developers can use it as the guts of asystem to which they add user interfaces or hooks to their own applications.andO;Tomahawk deals with such abstractions as fonts and lines, widows and orphans(bits of text that protrude awkwardly at the start of a page or a line, likethis).andM;It also knows about pagination, handling blocks of text or image,incorporating data from databases, page numbers and cross-references,hyphenation and justification, and so forth.andP;  Most of these parameters areadjustable by user commands.andP;  It's up to the application developer to hidethat with a user-friendly front-end or hooks into an application that does itautomatically.andP;  For example, R.R.andP;  Donnelley will be incorporating theTomahawk and T/Ware logic into the next release of Pulsar, a large-scalepublishing system for catalogue operations used at Tandy and other majorcatalogue retailers.andP;  These customers design, copywrite, compose and assemblepages and proof on site, and can also generate different versions of thepages merging in, say, regional prices from a database.andP;  &quot;All we do is add inthe scanned color images and print,&quot; says Harold Evans, general manager ofcustomer publishing systems at R.R.andP;  Donnelley.andM;This could be the start of something big for R.R.andP;  Donnelley.andP;  &quot;We could seeour customers wanting to do more and more things in house,&quot; says Evans, &quot;sowe decided to be proactive.andP;  We wrote a spec for inhouse development, becausewe couldn't get at the source code of our existing pc-based system.andP;  But thenwe ran into Deucalion, which had already built more functionality than wedescribed, and designed it to be integrated with other things.&quot; The prices ofthe resulting system range from $150,000 to $3 million, and Evans sees salesgrowing to hundreds but not thousands of units each year.andP;  Not all thecustomers are printing customers too, and the system can't help but endearDonnelley to them.andP;  The company also plans to provide similar systems forcustomers in other groups such as magazines, financial printing anddirectories.andM;Newspaper system vendor CText co-developed Tomahawk (and shares resalerights) and is using it to build a new editorial system, Dateline, for theChicago Tribune.andP;  While the Crystal and Donnelley systems import data fromservers, Dateline uses a server to manage its basic inventory -- text files.andO;The server in this case is a Tandem relational database, which performs muchthe same function SQL Server performs for Saros FileShare (see Release 1.0,89-6).andP;  A database application manages copy flow, audit trails and other filemanagement tasks, while the Tomahawk front-end provides the publishingcapabilities.andP;  Tomahawk works mostly on the hardware server, but itshyphenation and justification software sits on the user's desktop, coexistingin OS/2 with an OS/2-PM version of XyWrite.andP;  Dateline will be ready inOctober.andM;LOTUS NOTESandM;Lotus Notes has been under development since late 1984 at Iris Associates, aseparate company founded by Symphony developer Ray Ozzie; Lotus has exclusiverights to it.andP;  In short form, it's a general-purpose textbase with aforms-based front-end that gives users powerful text-manipulation andcommunication capabilities.andM;Each Note, or document, is akin to a database record, defined by the formused to create it.andP;  The Note can have a variety of fields, as in a database --text or numeric, graphics or image, optional or required, items in a listwith multiple or only single choices allowed.andP;  The Notes can be seen in views-- data selected according to field-based criteria such as dates or key wordsand selected fields in each form.andP;  As in an outline, you can see data inexpanded or abbreviated versions -- headlines only or full text, and soforth.andP;  The result is something like an extremely flexible text database: Ithas the extract-and-select feel of a database, and the hierarchical feel ofan outline.andM;As a result of its client-server architecture, it's networked and can workremotely (proved out by constant Notes-based communication between Iris andLotus over past months), with facilities for messages, notifications androuting among users.andP;  There are neat little features that enable theautomatic sending of mail outside the system through gateways on the server,etc.andP;  It will come with any combination of OS/2 and DOS for clients andservers, although we think the one that makes most sense except for trialversions is DOS clients and OS/2  servers.andM;Promise and perplexityandM;But it's likely to be a tough sell.andP;  It takes work to build a Notesapplication, and people can't quite understand it until they seeit...although once they do it's a quicker leap of mind than Agenda.andP;  But allAgenda needs for a sale is one person; Notes is designed for groups.andP;  Lotusitself recently had a crisis of faith on how to sell the product, andconsidered farming out the job.andP;  It has now decided to keep the productin-house.andP;  Evidently the thought of losing the product to some other marketerfocused management's attention, and they decided they couldn't forgo theopportunity after all.andM;Possible applications include the kinds of support systems mentioned above(page 11), sales-lead tracking, publishing of dynamic information internallyor for customers, task-force or project communication, any kind ofapplication where people are doing semi-structured work and need to keep eachother informed.andP;  Yes, that's a broad area.andP;  If Lotus proves out the idea, itwill have lots of competition, both from focused efforts such as A priori andAnswer, and from other textbases, including Xanadu plus application tools.andM;A model of the modelandM;Lotus Notes exemplifies many of the issues surrounding the business ofclient-server text applications.andP;  For performance and functionality, it wasbuilt on a proprietary text-oriented database.andP;  Could it have been built onSQL Server, like Saros? The project was started long before SQL Server wasavailable -- and even now the promise of support for objects rather than datafields in most databases is still a promise.andP;  The balance of the server'stips so far to other kinds of data structures and links that most of itneeded to be written fresh anyway -- and it might well be possible to hookthe relational database part of the server into some standard databaseservers one of these days.andM;The unavoidable problem is: If you do something genuinely new, it's not goingto be standard.andP;  (And only customers and even competitors can make it one.)andO;That doesn't matter so much if it's an application, or even a tailoreddevelopment tool such as Syntactics' and Deucalion's (which both frontendstandard systems), but it's a substantial disadvantage if you're trying tobuild a platform for third-party development,andM;In the old days, these things happened gradually: dBASE was considered anapplication for years, and Ashton-Tate, it seems, was the last to discoverthe secret.andP;  But now everyone wants standards and platforms from thebeginning.andM;Notes will be starting off as an application with a developer's front-end -arich set of menu-driven commands that can take user-defined parameters todefine fields and views and data flows.andP;  This product, to be released byyear-end, will enable users to build substantial applications, but Lotusitself is already building applications for beta sites that require moreintimate access to the Notes engine and linking with external C applicationmod ules.andP;  The customers should have the same chance, and they willeventually.andP;  The code, of course, is there, but the documentation requiredfor Lotus to release the application programming interface as a product isstill lacking.andP;  That will get Notes to the point of openness.andP;  The finalquestion is: Will it be a standard?andM;RUSSIA RELEASE 1.2: DECEPTIVE TRUTHS AND HONEST LIESandM;First, a straightforward correction: The price of 35,820 rubles in thepicture on page 10 of our Russia issue (Release 1.0, 89-5) applies not to asingle computer but to a 12-seat teacher/student set.andP;  That's the good news.andO;The bad news is that they're low-power systems, non-compatible, and even theteacher system's storage is limited.andM;This was pointed out to us by one of the Russians mentioned in the article,who was here on a visit.andP;  He mentioned two other items, enhancements ratherthan bug fixes, that provoke thought,andM;First, he disagreed that there is a shortage ofpaper.andP;  How could we misssomething so concrete, we wondered.andP;  &quot;That is just a euphemism,&quot; he asserted.andO;For political control? For what? But everyone we met said there was a papershortage.andP;  Michael Brodie of GTE Labs, who was over there shortly after us(and came back with a much more optimistic view), notes that conferenceproceedings generally aren't published -- because of paper shortages.andO;So...what's the truth? Probably there isn't really a paper shortage.andP;  Thereare lots of trees in the Soviet Union.andP;  Paper is theoretically available, butthere's a little slip-up in the production and distribution channels -- tothe extent that the Soviet Union recently signed a five-year contract withFinland to set up paper plants.andP;  In the end, if people can't get it, andarrange their lives on that assumption, does it matter if it's really ashortage or only inaccessibility? The point about life in the Soviet Union isnot the lack of resources, but the inability of people to find and use themeffectively.andM;But the greater point is the ambiguity of information in general.andP;  Right now,there is tremendous freedom.andP;  Meetings of the legislature were televisedrecently, until the powers decided the broadcasts were cutting into daytimeproductivity and the Soviet people had to get back to serious work.andP;  Or wasthat really the reason? What are the laws and what are the proposed laws? Ifthe law says you can do something but a frightened bureaucrat stalls you to astandstill, then what is the law? How free can you be, and how can youinvest, if you're not sure current conditions will last? Freedom and businessclimates don't exist for points in time: They're born of a history thatteaches people how to take advantage and a clear future that gives thepresent meaning.andP;  To put it financially, the discount rate in the SovietUnion for anything other than tangible goods is close to 100 percent.andM;Finally, a more cheerful comment.andP;  &quot;You missed an important point about thequeues,&quot; our friend told us.andP;  &quot;You realize of course that it is possible tosave a place in several queues at the same time.&quot; In other words, if you goshopping with a friend, the two of you can comfortably hold places in sixqueues, dramatically increasing your efficiency.andP;  (As long as you don't getto the front of the take-away queue before you've gotten your receipt fromthe payment queue or made your choice in the selection queue!) And onceyou've done that, why not hold down three places in the same limited-amountqueue? If a vendor limits you to, say, a kilo of grapes (a commonoccurrence), you can get three kilos by judicious queue-navigation.andM;The most aggressive jumpers may come up near to the front of a queue and askto someone, &quot;Can I have my place back?&quot; Vhen the innocent stander protests,the jumper says, &quot;Of course I was here! I remember you, with that red shirt!&quot;andO;It works more often than not.andP;  But it works only because the proportion ofpeople playing the game is still low.andP;  This reminds us of Bernardo Huberman'swork on the impact of intelligent agents in a population of mostly naiveagents (see Release 1.0, 89-6).andP;  Generally, a small number of intelligentagents make things go more smoothly.andP;  But if you get too many of them, allsecond-guessing each other, the system disintegrates into chaos.andP;  How aboutit, Bernardo? Could you run a simulation, please?andM;RELEASE 0.5: HALF-BAKED COMMENTSandM;OUR FIRST (AND PROBABLY ONLY) AD...andM;Thinking about the free flow of information and efficient markets, we figuredone of our readers moving to Boston might find the following genuine offeruseful:andM;Back Bay condominium for sale.andP;  Commonwealth Avenue at Exeter.andP;  One bedroom,1.5 bathrooms, 824 square feet plus patio in a century-old (renovated) brickbuilding, Previous tenant liked it, likes married life in a bigger place evenmore.andP;  $155,000.andP;  Call (617) 354-6837.andM;A TRUE STORY...andM;A software guy we know (you know him, too) who came from the hardwarebusiness: &quot;I don't understand what all this fuss is about quality control.andO;Why don't they just testevery tenth tape?&quot;andM;TOLERANCE FOR TURKEYS TOO...andM;Let's honor the flag by supporting the rights of free expression itsymbolizes.andP;  Burning the flag is generally a tacky, offensive thing to do,but it should not be outlawed.andM;Quick! What applications do you think of when you hear the word &quot;text&quot;?andO;Probably word-processing and mail-merge, maybe desktop publishing or textretrieval.andP;  E-mail perhaps.andP;  And that's probably it.andM;But there's much, much more.andP;  As with data (but 20 years later), there's aproliferation of text tools and applications based on client-serverarchitectures -- a text store as a back-end, with text applications asfrontends.andP;  In other words, a text application doesn't load a file; itselects the text or data it needs from shared files that can be usedconcurrently by other users or applications.andP;  This offers the same assurancesof integrity of text across applications and multi-user access as a databasedoes for more structured data.andM;The first system described here is Xanadu, the 19-year-old global textserverproject of hypertext guru Ted Nelson that has gained a poor reputation amongmany who were excited a few years ago but have waited too long in vain.andP;  Nowthere's visible progress at Xanadu - -mostly because of its 80percentpurchase by Autodesk, which has a practical application for this systemcreated by visionaries.andP;  Autodesk is visionary enough to support Xanadu'slong-term goals while insisting on short-term results.andP;  Xanadu is building aback-end, which will come with its own front-end application and also supporta more specialized system from Autodesk for managing AutoCAD data.andP;  The dreambehind Xanadu includes the idea of &quot;hypertext publishing,&quot; whereby people puttheir efforts into a giant text/database, and other people or smart agentshelp readers find and select only what they want.andP;  Early efforts in thisdirection include Anterior Technology's In Moderation, and Pinpoint'sComputer Focus and Individual's First! customized newsletters.andM;Early text applications, most based on text/database servers, include supporttools from Answer and Lysis, and a documentation generator from Solutron forresale by Index Technology.andP;  Finally there are application development tools,such asSyntactics' Crystal series, Deucalion's Tomahawk, both with interfacesto standard relational databases, and Lotus Notes, with its own proprietarytextbase.andP;  All of them are exciting.andP;  They illustrate that there are manypowerful ways to manipulate text without actually &quot;understanding&quot; it --whatever that means, Drudgery can be reduced, mistakes of carelessness oromission eliminated, layout decisions and item selection can be automated,text bases can be automatically restructured for efficiency, As withdatabase, people are starting to understand the difference betweeninterpretive tools, which let the user manipulate text, and developmenttools, which let users delegate work by building compiled applications.'andM;But before you proceed, a caveat.andP;  Computers don't (for now) understand text.andO;They process input and generate &quot;meaningful&quot; output only as the result ofcriteria, rules and processes defined by humans -- and only for humans toread.andP;  Responsible vendors remember to point out that none of these systemsdesign themselves: The layout rules must be carefully decided and expressed;the text-selection filters may need a lot of fine-tuning; template documentsand boilerplate must be properly constructed and wellworded; answers toquestions must be accurate and intelligible.andP;  These systems help to dothings, but they must still be put into action by smart, sentient humanbeings.andM;Here is a matrix of text applications (a hybrid of one used by Lotus and onewe published last June in an article on groupware):andM;structureandM;referenceandM;database structured workflow managementandM;E-mail document generationandM;support databasesandM;static filtered dynamicandM;news feedandM;unfiltered E-mail conferencingandM;news feed desktop publishingandM;no structure  In essence, the matrix describes the interplay between thestructure of the data and the power of the applications applied to it.andO;(Hypertext publishing is not listed here because it can use -- or support --almost any of these applications, and so it fits everywhere or nowhere.) Thematrix doesn't make much distinction between whether the operation is donemanually or by a powerful application, or whether it's accomplished on aclient-server or a single-system model.andP;  The advantage of client-server, ofcourse, is the ease of sharing a single text base (and data model) acrossmultiple users and applications.andP;  The problem right now is that there is nosingle standard data model that everyone can use.andP;  Xanadu is proposing onestandard, while Lotus is using its own proprietary model, which will be openbut which the company is too sensible to propose as a standard as yet.andP;  (Avendor can be open, but only the marketplace can create a standard.andP;  And astandards committee can officiate.)andM;One's man's client is another man's serverandM;Note also that &quot;client&quot; software need not sit on &quot;client&quot; hardware.andO;Frequently a &quot;client&quot; application will sit on the server, managing andmanipulating the text files for access by other client applications that areused by individuals at workstations.andP;  This turns the server hardware systeminto an application server rather than simply a database server.andP;  Then theclient application sitting on the hardware server will look like a serverapplication as far as the end-user applications are concerned.andP;  It'sconfusing, but this is the point of cooperative processing and peer-to-peerarchitectures.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
