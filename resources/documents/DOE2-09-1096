It was shown that a Ca decreasepromotes the intergranular YAG formation instead of the glassy phase.Moreover, it was found that HIP is highly beneficial when the intergranularphase is glassy whereas it is deleterious when YAG is present. Furthermore,the role of interfaces especially beta-prime-glass was analyzed downto the atomic scale. 8 references.</TEXT></DOC>
