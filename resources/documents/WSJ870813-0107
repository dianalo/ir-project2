The credit markets' mediocre performance once again stood in sharp contrast to the surging stock market, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average vaulted to another record with a gain of more than 44 points in extremely heavy trading.    Recent government reports indicating unexpectedly strong economic growth have helped fuel the stock market's explosive rise. Also, oil prices have fallen in five of the past six sessions, helping to ease some investors' fears about the inflation outlook. Meanwhile, though, the Treasury's enormous financing needs have weighed heavily on the bond market. Moreover, many analysts contend that the economy's faster growth will increase pressures for higher inflation and interest rates in the next few months.    &quot;All the action now is in stocks,&quot; said Edwin Kantor, vice chairman of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. &quot;I think stocks will perform better than bonds right through to the end of the decade.&quot;    The Treasury's three-part borrowing began with its sale of about $9.83 billion of three-year notes. The average annual yield was 7.94%, as had been expected by many traders. F. Ward McCarthy, senior money market economist at Merrill Lynch Economics Inc., said the auction was &quot;a good start to the rest of the Treasury's financing&quot; this week.    Nevertheless, many bond traders predict higher interest rates this week as the Treasury sells $9.25 billion of 10-year notes today and $9 billion of 30-year bonds tomorrow. Several traders contend that 30-year Treasury bonds, now yielding about 8.95%, will offer about 9% or slightly higher soon.    The three-year note sale &quot;went reasonably well,&quot; said Alfred G. Roth, managing director and head of U.S. government securities trading at Chemical Bank. &quot;But we're looking for higher yields&quot; over the next few days.    Prices of long-term Treasury notes and bonds traded in a narrow range throughout most of the day. Late in the afternoon, Treasury bonds due in 30 years inched lower to wind up with declines of slightly more than a quarter-point, or over $2.50 for each $1,000 face amount. Corporate bonds generally were flat, while municipal issues advanced.    &quot;Investment interest right now is in stocks, not bonds,&quot; said Lawrence A. Kudlow, chief economist at Bear, Stearns andamp; Co. Thus, he contended that bond dealers will end up absorbing unusually large amounts of the Treasury notes and bonds slated for sale today and tomorrow. &quot;The dealers are going to have to be very heroic,&quot; he said.    The two remaining Treasury auctions come amid widespread speculation that several government reports to be released soon will provide further evidence of improved economic growth. For example, the Commerce Department tomorrow is expected to report that retail sales rose about 0.5% last month, following a 0.4% increase in June.    With the economy perking up somewhat, the Federal Reserve doesn't have any reason to alter its credit policy, many analysts agree. The Fed's credit policy committee, which meets about eight times a year, is scheduled to meet next Tuesday. That will be Alan Greenspan's first as chairman of the Reserve Board. Mr. Greenspan was sworn in yesterday as Fed chairman.    &quot;There is no particular reason for the Fed to move policy,&quot; said Laurence H. Meyer, president of a St. Louis-based economic forecasting firm bearing his name. A credit-easing move &quot;is out of the question,&quot; while credit-tightening also isn't likely, he said.    The stock market's explosive rise this week lifted even many issues that are sensitive to interest rate changes, such as banks and utilities. But Mr. Kudlow of Bear Stearns said he is &quot;quite skeptical&quot; about this sector, saying he expects borrowing costs to continue rising later this year as &quot;economic growth and inflation exceed expectations.&quot; He added: &quot;The fundamentals are quite worrisome for bonds and great for stocks.&quot;    Mr. Kantor of Drexel Burnham is especially optimistic about stocks and leery of bonds. &quot;The long bull market of the '80s in bonds is over with,&quot; he said.    Many large Wall Street brokerage firms reported sizable losses on securities trading during the second quarter as bond prices plummeted. However, Mr. Kantor, speaking at a press luncheon yesterday, said Drexel Burnham made money in all areas of securities trading during the quarter, except for municipal bonds, where he said the firm incurred a pretax loss of about $10 million.    In yesterday's activity, Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury bonds fell 1.08 points to close at 1258.04. It ranged between 1261.53 and 1257.04.    The Treasury's 8 3/4% bonds due 2017 fell to a price of 97 26/32 from 98 Monday, while the yield increased to 8.96% from 8.94%. The government's 8 1/2% notes due 1997 declined to 98 16/32 from 98 18/32, as the yield rose to 8.73% from 8.72%.    Rates on short-term Treasury bills were mixed. The rate on 13-week bills rose to 5.94% bid from 5.93%, while the rate on 26-week bills fell to 6.05% bid from 6.14%.    The rate on federal funds, reserves banks lend each other overnight, averaged 6.49%, according to an estimate by Fulton Prebon (U.S.A.). On Monday, the fed funds rate averaged 6.58%.    In the municipal market, Florida sold $83 million of pollution control general obligation bonds. An underwriting group led by Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. submitted the winning bid for the issue.    The Florida issue was offered to investors at yields ranging from 5% on bonds due 1989 to 7.80% on bonds due 2008 through 2010. The bonds are rated double-A by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.    Separately, a group of underwriters priced a $250 million offering of general obligation bonds by the Palm Beach, Fla. County School District. Yields range from $4.50% on bonds due 1988 to 7 7/8% on those due 2007.    The heavy slate of new government securities helped damp activity in the corporate new-issue market. Yesterday's large offerings included:    --A $200 million issue of Security Pacific Corp. notes due September 1992. Underwriters led by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets priced the notes at par to yield 9% or 0.75 percentage point more than the Treasury's five-year note. The notes are rated double-A-3 by Moody's and double-A by Sandamp;P.    --A $150 million issue of Bank of New York deposit notes due September 1992. Prudential-Bache Capital Funding priced the notes at par to yield 9.125%. The notes are rated double-A-2 by Moody's and single-A-plus by Sandamp;P.    --A $142.9 million issue of Home Mac Mortgage Securities Corp. collateralized mortgage bonds issued and underwritten by Salomon Brothers Inc. Yields on the bonds maturing between June 2001 and September 2018 ranged from 9.27% to 10.86%, or between 1.3 percentage points and 1.85 percentage points more than similiar-maturing Treasury bonds. Average maturities for the securities ranged between 3.4 and 20.2 years. The bonds are rated triple-A by both Moody's and Sandamp;P.    Here are the details of yesterday's auction of three-year Treasury notes:    Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it.
