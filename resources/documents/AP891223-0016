Moises Giroldi, who ledOctober's failed coup attempt against Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega,the U.S. overthrow of the Panamanian strongman was the welcomeculmination of a sad story.   But Adela Bonilla de Giroldi said she doesn't think Gen. ManuelAntonio Noriega, who she believes killed of her husband, will eversee trial in the United States, despite the $1 million bountyoffered by President Bush.   ``I have faith that they will find him dead,'' she said. ``Theywill never catch him alive. It doesn't matter to me if Bush wantsto put a price on Noriega's head. The important thing is thatNoriega doesn't stay in Panama.''   Mrs. Giroldi, 36, called U.S. Army officials two days before thefailed Oct. 3 coup attempt by her husband to appeal for help. Thecoup failed, and Noriega was reported to have executed Giroldihimself after regaining control. Mrs. Giroldi is among those whoaccuse the United States of dooming the coup by failing to supportit quickly enough.   ``I was so frustrated because President Bush didn't do anythingfor my husband,'' Mrs. Giroldi said Thursday in Miami, where shefled after the failed coup. ``But now, even though many lives havebeen lost (in the U.S. invasion), I am relieved. My husband did notdie in vain. His dream of ridding Panama of Noriega has come true.He is dead but he died for a great cause.''   Mrs. Giroldi said her husband, a one-time confidante of Noriega,planned to deliver the general alive to U.S. authorities to facedrug trafficking charges. But Pentagon officials have said Giroldiplaned to let Noriega retire in Panama. The Bush administration itsinaction during the coup attempt stemmed from disagreement amongthe rebels about what to do with Noriega.   Like many Panamanian exiles, Mrs. Giroldi, a mother of three whoworked at the national bank of Panama, said she would return assoon as stability was restored.   ``It is our home and we want to help rebuild it,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
