Taft IV, the U.S. ambassador to theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization, says the crisis in theBaltic states is forcing the alliance to rethink its basicpolicies and future relationship with the Soviet Union.Though still far from erupting beyond the Soviet borders, themilitary crackdown in Lithuania is causing strains inEast-West relations at a time neither side can afford it.   Speaking in an interview at NATO headquarters here, Mr.Taft said the U.S. and its allies were worried that theSoviet Union was failing to realize just how concerned theWest is about the Baltics. The crackdown there is just partof a growing body of evidence of a new hard-line stance invarious aspects of political and economic life, he said.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The reforms that have been going on in the Soviet Union-- glasnost, perestroika -- are essential for the managementof the Soviet Union's problems and for meeting the legitimatedemands of its people for a better life,&quot; Mr. Taft said.&quot;They are also essential for a good relationship with theWest.&quot;   Diplomats from the 16 NATO members held a series ofmeetings last week trying to decide how to respond to thechanges in internal Soviet policies. Hanging in the balanceare crucial arms control agreements, a fragile Eastern Europeand an unstable Middle East.
