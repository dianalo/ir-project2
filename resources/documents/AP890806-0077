The 37-count indictment also alleges that Patrick G. King,former president of Vernon Savings Association, illegally used thethrift's money to to make $55,000 worth of political contributionsto several congressmen, including former House Speaker Jim Wright,D-Texas, and U.S. Rep. Jack Kemp, R-New York.   King is scheduled to be tried Monday on federal charges ofconspiracy, misapplication of funds and making false entries onVernon's books in connection with the use of thrift money. He haspleaded innocent.   King was the state's deputy thrift commissioner before he joinedVernon.   Prosecution documents filed Thursday detail the alleged use ofVernon funds to provide female escorts, lavish trips and otherentertainment for former thrift commissioner L. Linton Bowman III,Vernon Savings owner Don R. Dixon, King and other Vernon officials,The Dallas Morning News reported.   But King's attorney, Emmett Colvin of Dallas, filed motionscontending prostitution-hiring charges may have been improperlyhandled because Bowman was impotent at the time of the allegedincidents.   King was employed by the savings and loan commission underBowman's supervision, eventually becoming deputy commissioner,before joining Vernon in 1983.   Bowman was appointed state savings and loan commissioner in1983, presiding over the Texas thrift industry until November 1987,when he resigned. Vernon Savings was closed by federal regulatorsthat month, with losses totaling more than $1.3 billion.   Prosecutors allege that shortly after King was hired at Vernon,he set up several excursions that included paid femalecompanionship for his former boss at Dixon's request.   The alleged excursions reportedly continued from January 1985 toJanuary 1986, while state regulators _ under Bowman's supervision _and federal thrift examiners became increasingly critical ofspeculative lending, insider dealings and other questionablepractices at Vernon.   A defense motion filed Thursday suggests that governmentprosecutors may have misled the federal grand jury that indictedKing by failing to tell them that Bowman was impotent at the timethe women were hired.   U.S. Justice Department prosecutors Robert E. Hauberg Jr. andStephen P. Learned acknowledged in a letter July 24 that they knewabout Bowman's impotence but did not reveal it to the grand jury.   But prosecutors contended in the letter to King's lawyer thatBowman's condition was kept confidential at his attorney's requestand is not an issue in King's case.   ``Whether or not Mr. Bowman ... had the capacity, the desire orthe charm needed to engage in sex, given the opportunity to sharepaid female companionship, is irrelevant to a misappropriation ofbank funds ... ,'' the prosecutors' letter says.   Bowman could not be reached for comment. A secretary at hisAustin consulting office told the newspaper he was traveling andcould not be reached. Repeated telephone calls to his home andoffice were not returned Friday.</TEXT></DOC>
