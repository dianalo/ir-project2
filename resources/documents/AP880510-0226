The Bahamas decided to buy the ads as part of its response tocharges of Bahamian drug corruption raised in various quarters,including the federal trial of Colombia's reputed drug kingpin,Carlos Lehder Rivas, government spokesman Bill Kalis said.   The ad in The New York Times, Washington Post, Miami Herald andother newspapers was addressed to ``the people of the United Statesof America'' and signed by Bahamian Attorney General Paul L.Adderly.   It says the Commonwealth of the Bahamas has devoted much of itslimited resources to fighting drugs and needs more U.S. aid.   Specifically, the ad cites the need for ``more air search radarinstallations, more joint bases strategically located withhelicopter strike force teams, more air reconnaissance patrols,more sea patrols and intensified joint undercover and conspiracyinvestigations.''   It says the archipelago of 700 islands and keys and 250,000people spends 13 percent of its national budget on law enforcement,mostly fighting drugs produced in South America and bound for usersin the United States.   Published reports have said grand juries in Tampa and Miami areinvestigating Prime Minister Sir Lynden O. Pindling. And reports inCongress have raised doubts about Bahamian drug-fighting efforts.   ``He started thinking about this during these latest allegationsat the Lehder trial,'' Kalis said.   ``As you know, the position was not to respond while thetestimony was being heard. Now that the testimony is over, theprime minister wanted to take an opportunity to make the Bahamianposition better known.''   During Lehder's trial in Jacksonville, U.S. Attorney RobertMerkle had produced testimony that Pindling was receiving drugpayoffs of up to $5 million. Lehder allegedly used Norman's Cay inthe Bahamas as a key transfer point for Colombian cocaine bound forFlorida and Georgia.   Adderly's advertisement Tuesday called attention to a 1984 RoyalCommission of Inquiry report in the Bahamas that criticized lack ofcooperation by U.S. authorities during its probe into official drugcorruption. That commission found evidence of drug corruption insome levels of the Bahamian government and law enforcement, but didnot tie Pindling to drug payoffs.   Last week, Pindling issued a statement to the news media and ata rally flatly denying taking drug payoffs.   Pindling said he was not surprised by the allegations atLehder's trial but would be surprised if any of the grand juriesreportedly investigating his affairs indicted him.   Pindling was re-elected last year after criticizing thecorruption allegations, which first surfaced in a 1983 report. Hehas been in power since breaking the hold of the white-minoritygovernment in 1967.</TEXT></DOC>
