Even if production of the fleet of planes stays onbudget _ which is unlikely _ it is by far the most costly plane inhistory. That's the bad news.   Yet its promised capability to replace the U.S.'s aginglong-range bombers make it one of the key components to defendingAmerica into the next century.   Lines are being divided in Congress with most of the divisioncoming over the cost of the plane, not whether it is a reliabledeterrent to war.   Unlike industry, which can do testing and market research inprivate, U.S. defense is developed out in the open. That is how itshould be.   But it unfortunately allows decisions to be based on factorsother than need. While the need for Star Wars defense has alwaysbeen open to debate, the need for a new bomber system is not.   Congress should continue full funding for research anddevelopment of the B-2, and be ready to fund it if the testsresults are positive.</TEXT><TEXT>   July 20   Philadelphia Daily News on the B-2 bomber:   The B-2 flew the other day. It didn't go far or fast, but itflew.   Under ordinary circumstances, this would not be impressive.After all, the least a $500 million airplane should be able to dois fly a little. But these are not ordinary times.   Some people are presenting this unimpressive feat as vindicationof $22 billion already spent on the B-2 and an excuse to spendanother $70 billion.   Jimmy Carter canceled the troubled B-1 program in 1980 on theground that we could wait for the B-2. Reagan decided to do both.The B-1 works sometimes. The B-2 may never work. Neither has amission, at least one that makes any sense in the modern world.   Instead of wasting more piles of money, it would be more usefulto revive the old idea of the Marshal Plan. Send all that B-2 moneyto places like Poland and Hungary, where it can be put to usecuring a dreadful pollution problem and rebuilding an industrialbase.   That would go a lot further toward ensuring the security of theUnited States than a fleet of incredibly expensive warplanes withno reason for existing.</TEXT><TEXT>   July 24   The Daily Republic, Mitchell, S.D., on campaign reform:   At long last, a step has been taken in the right direction onthe issue of campaign reform.   If President Bush has his way, most political action committeecontributions to Congress members would be eliminated, personal useof campaign funds would be prohibited, and carrying over funds fromone campaign to the next would be barred. The proposal would alsomandate the disclosure of indirect campaign contributions called``soft money.''   Bush's bid is long overdue, and the public should be pleasedthat steps are being taken to end the backstage financing ofCongress members.   Money, says former Sen. Les AuCoin, D-Wis., is ``endangering theform of government and the democracy we have,'' and he decries the``endless ... virtual hourly pursuit of money'' by members ofCongress.   And so do we.</TEXT><TEXT>   July 25   The Wichita (Kan.) Eagle-Beacon on President Bush's clean airbill:   President Bush last week proposed a weaker air pollution billthan he'd led Americans to expect.   Last month, when ... Bush announced that he supported a tougherfederal clean air law and outlined what provisions he thought sucha law should have, he seemed ready to take on the nation's largestpollution source: the car.   But (his) proposal ... actually could increase auto pollution insome regions. ...   Bush at least is on board. And Congress is desirous of updatingthe woefully inadequate Clean Air Act passed in 1977.   Chances are good, in brief, that a better bill than ... Bushproposed will come out of the congressional pipeline. ...   The process is off to a good start.</TEXT><TEXT>   July 21   Waco (Texas) Tribune-Herald on protecting the environment:   Environmentalism has come a long way in the last two decades.Americans now generally accept the notion that society has aresponsibility to defend the environment just as it defendscitizens and the country.   The business of defending against ecological crimes has becomemuch more intricate since the infancy of the EnvironmentalProtection Agency.   Since the inception of the EPA's Office of CriminalInvestigations in 1982, the government has had considerable successin catching polluters in the act. It has convicted 145 corporationsand 375 people.   Up until recently, however, the effect of such convictions waslessened by the fact that generally companies faced only fines,since few of the crimes had felony status.   However, in recent times Congress elevated violations of theClean Water Act and Superfund law to felony status, meaning prisonfor the executives who oversee the crime.   That's as it should be. When a company uses illegal dumping as apractice and can afford to risk the fine levied against it, themanagement will hardly be deterred. However, when its executivesknow they can go to prison for illegal dumping, they will stop andthink.   Americans have come to behold crimes against the environment ascrimes against themselves. It makes sense to have punishment thatfits such a crime.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
