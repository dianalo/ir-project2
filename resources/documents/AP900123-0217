They don't outwardly show concern that what is happening inEastern Europe will happen to them; for one thing, Asian communismis rooted in still-revered nationalist heroes, such as China's MaoTse-tung and Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh in Vietnam.   Nor do they agree that the upheaval in Eastern Europe resultedfrom a failure of the communist system itself.   ``It's not that the tree is no good, but the ones who plantedthe tree are no good,'' as Maj. Gen. Trang Cong Man, permanent vicesecretary-general of the Vietnam Journalists Association, explainedit.   Unlike Eastern Europe's version, Asian communism finds strengthin traditional Confucianism, which emphasizes respect for authority.   At the same time, Asian communists face no organized oppositioncomparable to Poland's Solidarity labor movement that could form arallying point for dissent.   Thus, even in the face of Eastern Europe's sweeping changes,Asia's communist nations are vigorously defending their one-partyrule.   China's Communist Party chief, Jiang Zemin, said at year end theleadership of the party is a ``historical necessity. ... Withoutcentralism we will have extreme democracy and anarchy, and nothingcan be accomplished.''   Highly regimented North Korea, which is largely closed off tothe non-communist world, is reported to have recalled some of itsstudents from Eastern Europe, presumably so they would not witnessthe changes that Pyongyang considers political heresy.   Kim Jong Il, son of long-time leader Kim Il Sung and heirapparent, said the North Korean Communist Party ``must on noaccount admit hetergeneous ideas into it. In party activity, theunity of action based on a single ideology can be realized throughmonolithic leadership.''   Even tiny Laos, which has been led by communists since theIndochina War, had something to say. Its official radio opened thenew year with a broadcast acknowledging that 1989 was ``anightmare'' for communism and calling on the people to rally aroundthe party.   No Asian country has been more vocal than Vietnam in defense ofcommunism.   Nguyen Van Linh, the Vietnamese party chief, said in his NewYear's message that building socialism would be a goal for Vietnamin 1990. Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach said the communism systemwould emerge reinvigorated after overcoming the crisis it faces inEastern Europe.   Still, the Asian nations clearly are troubled by theimplications of the European revolution and are drawing lessons.   ``We follow these events in Europe so we can distinguish what isgood and what is bad,'' said Trang Cong Man of the journalistsassociation. The sweeping changes show, for example, that EasternEuropeans wanted more democracy and higher production levels, hesaid.   Hanoi already realizes that if communism is to survive it needsa dose of market-oriented reform to stimulate the economy.   After a decade of disastrous economic policies, Vietnam in 1986introduced reforms such as deregulating prices, permitting privateenterprise and vastly curtailing subsidies to state enterprises.   Although Vietnam remains one of the world's poorest nations,substantial gains in food production and in fighting inflation weremade last year and consumerism is on the rise.   Many Hanoi stores already are stocked with the foreign colortelevisions and video cassette recorders favored by Vietnamese.   In many ways, the economic program is similar to that institutedin China in the early 1980s by Deng Xiaoping, the senior leader.   Deng refused to open up the political system, however, leadingto widespread protests for democracy that eventually led to thebloody crackdown on dissent and the resurgence of aging,conservative leaders who are turning back on economic reform.   Hanoi also has opted to proceed with political change at a muchslower pace than economic reform.   The Vietnamese Communist Party newspaper Nhan Dan said inNovember the party ``does not accept opposition political partiesin a socialist society _ the main feature of political pluralismhas been rejected by our party.''   Exhausted from decades of fighting foreign armies, theVietnamese don't seem to hold a multiparty system as one of theirimmediate aims.   ``What the people like most is peace and security, and doingbusiness and developing the economy, that is the first and foremostdemand of the Vietnamese people,'' said Nguyen Dinh Thi, a writerand a party member for 40 years.   However, he indicated that while people are not necessarilyinterested now in a multiparty system they do want more opennessfrom the leadership.   ``This party must accept pluralism of opinions,'' he said in aninterview. ``I think we should have many social organizations, butit is not necessary to have many parties.''   In private conversations, however, Vietnamese encountered by avisiting reporter indicated approval of what has happened inEastern Europe.   ``Yes, I know what has happened in Eastern Europe,'' said astore clerk, in a typical reaction. ``It is good, and it will begood for Vietnam, too.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Monday PMs, Jan. 29</NOTE></DOC>
