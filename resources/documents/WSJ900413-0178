But Mr. Collor's success in his battle with Congress mayhave been the easy part. Now that he has a free hand, Mr.Collor faces the challenge of finding a way to soften theplan's recessionary effects without triggering a new wave ofinflation.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The situation in Congress looked pretty messy and what hedid is pretty extraordinary,&quot; said a diplomat who followedthe process closely. &quot;But administering this thing will be achallenge and a half. He has to fine-tune monetary policy,cut spending and balance the budget in the face of a possiblydeep recession.&quot;   Mr. Collor's biggest victory in the fight with Congress,which has been voting on the plan measure by measure for ninedays, came early Thursday when it unexpectedly approved by aslim margin the program's centerpiece: an 18-month freeze onabout 80% of the money in circulation in the Brazilianeconomy, estimated at about $115 billion.   The government achieved this freeze, believed to be one ofthe biggest liquidity squeezes in history, by bottling up allfunds in excess of 50,000 cruzeiros ($1,052) in savings andchecking accounts for 18 months, to be redeemed in 12 monthlyinstallments with 6% interest. The government also limitedwithdrawals from the overnight market, a one-day savingsaccount in which about $60 billion was invested as a hedgeagainst inflation; capped withdrawals from interest-bearingaccounts to 20,000 cruzeiros or 25% of total funds, whicheveris highest; and limited withdrawals from money-marketaccounts to 20%.   By deliberately starving the economy of cash, thegovernment is seeking to prevent the boom in consumer demandthat accompanied previous anti-inflation plans here and curbspending when price and wage controls are lifted. But thefreeze has brought to a standstill large parts of theBrazilian economy, including the automobile and constructionindustries, and many feel the government has simply replacedhigh inflation with deep recession. Industrial productionfell by 14.7% in March, according to the NationalConfederation of Industry, and many companies, deprived bothof working capital and cash flow, have had to borrow money topay wages, temporarily lay off workers or even close down.   In a bid to soften the plan's impact, the center-rightBrazilian Democratic Movement Party, the largest in Congresswith 179 of 570 seats, sought to push through an amendmentsignificantly raising the ceiling on withdrawals from thefrozen funds. But 51 Democratic Movement deputies broke rankswith their own party and voted down the proposal, ensuringthe approval of Mr. Collor's original text by a 249-206margin. &quot;I am extremely satisfied with the result of thesession in Congress,&quot; Mr. Collor said.   If that was his most important victory, it wasn't his onlyone. Almost all the most important of the 20-odd measures hesubmitted to Congress have been approved, although sometimeswith minor modifications. Key measures approved include theclosure of 23 state institutions, new taxes on financialtransactions, and authorization to sell off many of Brazil's188 state-run companies, which have a combined deficit of $62billion.   But in approving the privatization plan, Congressprohibited the sale of Banco do Brasil, the country's largestcommercial bank, Petrobras, the state oil company, Embratel,the national telecommunications giant, the postal service andnational development banks. Congress also limited foreignownership to 49% and a maximum of 40% of voting capital.Congress also decided that any debt-for-equity swaps in theprivatization process will be governed by a separate law.   With the major planks of his plan now approved, attentionis shifting to how Mr. Collor will succeed in avoiding toodeep a recession, or even a depression. Analysts now expectthe government to announce measures to boost the automobile,construction and other capital-goods industries and promoteexports, which have been paralyzed. The central bank earlierthis week effectively devalued the cruzeiro against thedollar by about 5%. The dollar is now worth about 47cruzeiros on the official market.</TEXT></DOC>
