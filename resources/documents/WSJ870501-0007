Mr. Weinberger's ruling is eagerly awaited by more than a score of potential airframe, engine and avionics contractors for the program, which has been challenged by critics in and out of the Pentagon since early this year.    &quot;We're fairly sure that the secretary will support the LHX,&quot; said Brig. Gen. Ronald Andreson, who manages the program for the Army's Aviation Systems Command. The letters designate the program's official name of Light Helicopter Experimental.    Approval by Mr. Weinberger would authorize two competing teams of airframe manufacturers to deliver prototypes of a lightweight, high-technology helicopter family to replace an aging fleet of Vietnam-era rotary-wing craft.    The Army earlier nominated the McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Co. unit of McDonnell Douglas Corp. and the Bell Helicopter Textron Inc. unit of Textron Inc. to make up one team, and Boeing Co.'s Boeing Vertol Co. division and United Technologies Corp.'s Sikorsky Aircraft division to make up the other.    The industry has been alerted by the Army to expect requests for bids on LHX contracts in a few weeks, an indication that the program is going forward, a McDonnell Douglas spokesman said.    The Army plans to replace 6,887 UH-1 Hueys, AH-1 Cobras and other old models with 4,168 LHXs in two versions -- one heavily armed for knocking out tanks and hostile helicopters and another for landing troops on a battlefield.    Production would stretch into the late 1990s. The LHX program would be the largest ever developed by the Army, comparable in cost to the Air Force's advanced tactical fighter, or ATF, program.    The LHX program appeared to be in doubt early this year when Pentagon analysts urged alternatives such as equipping the already developed McDonnell Douglas AH-64 Apaches with more-advanced flight and combat controls.    At the same time, some of the airframe bidders appeared to have other ideas for the new helicopter family. McDonnell Douglas, worried that its helicopter-assembly line in Mesa, Ariz., would run out of orders before the LHX is in production, pressed Congress this spring to use some LHX funds for extending Apache production beyond fiscal 1988, which begins next Oct 1.    However, at the most recent high-level review of the program on April 23, Gen. Andreson argued that an upgraded Apache would cost $3 million more than a brand-new LHX and wouldn't have the speed, resistance to radar observation and other technical advantages of the new model. There was some &quot;lively discussion,&quot; but the balance of opinion in the review board still favors the LHX, Gen. Andreson said.    A spokeswoman for Mr. Weinberger said he is hearing recommendations by the review board and will hand down his opinion next week to the board's chairman, Pentagon acquisition chief Richard Godwin. She declined to predict Mr. Weinberger's decision.    A firm Pentagon decision to take LHX to the crucial prototype stage could force both houses of Congress to adjust Army budget authorizations. The House Armed Services Committee, which has been skeptical of the LHX program, voted to authorize only $10 million for research and development on the program in fiscal 1988. The equivalent Senate panel is recommending $170 million. </TEXT></DOC>
