The investors' ultimatum underscores how much the buy-outbusiness has dwindled from its hectic pace in the late 1980s.Furthermore, the potential dissolution of the $178 millionAdler andamp; Shaykin fund may have implications for the dozens ofother buy-out funds that aren't living up to investorexpectations.</LP><TEXT>   Leonard Shaykin, Adler andamp; Shaykin general partner, said inan interview that his firm's buy-out fund may be dissolved byyear end. Mr. Shaykin said he originally opposed investors'requests to pull out of his buy-out fund, but is no longeropposing them. He added that he hopes to reconstitute asmaller successor fund once the withdrawals are completed.   Founded in 1983, Adler andamp; Shaykin for much of the 1980s hadbeen a highflier in the buy-out business. The firm completed$2.5 billion of acquisitions, buying Joy Manufacturing Co.,Best Products Inc., the Chicago Sun-Times and nearly a dozensmaller companies. Its current buy-out fund was raised inMarch 1989 and was due to keep making investments until 1994.   In the past two years, though, Adler andamp; Shaykin and itsbuy-out fund have fared poorly. The firm's largestacquisition, Best Products Inc., incurred large losses andwas forced to file last January for protection from creditorsunder Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Adler andamp; Shaykinwas unable to find any new acquisitions. And a series ofpartners and other executives quit the buy-out firm, oftenbecause of friction with Mr. Shaykin.   As is typical of buy-out firms, Adler andamp; Shaykin gets mostof the capital in its fund from major banks, insurancecompanies and pension funds. These investors agree to makemoney available to Adler andamp; Shaykin for acquisitions of itschoosing.   Buy-out fund investors generally have limited ability tocancel their financing commitments partway through the lifeof a fund. But Adler andamp; Shaykin, like other buy-out groups,allows its fund to be disbanded by unanimous consent of itsinvestors.   In recent weeks, according to people familiar with thenegotiations between Mr. Shaykin and his 24 investors, agroundswell of investors in the Adler andamp; Shaykin fund haveasked to withdraw. Among those reportedly asking to get outare Mellon Bank Corp., Equitable Life Assurance Society ofthe U.S. and Manufacturers Hanover Corp. Mellon Bankofficials were unavailable for comment; Equitable andManufacturers declined to comment.   &quot;It's a big blow for any group to have its money takenback,&quot; said Steven Galante, publisher of Private EquityAnalyst, a West Newton, Mass., newsletter that follows thebuy-out business. Mr. Galante said he knew of only one priorcase, involving a John Hancock Insurance Co. fund in 1989,where investors had pulled out of a buy-out-related fundpartway through its intended life.   But Mr. Shaykin predicted that his settlement with hisinvestors &quot;will have precedent value for what happens withother funds.&quot; Some large banks and insurance companies arefacing their own financial pressures, he observed, and areeager to reduce their commitments to buy-out funds. Suchcommitments, by some estimates, total more than $10 billionnationwide.   Even though Adler andamp; Shaykin hasn't completed anyacquisitions in nearly three years, the firm collects amanagement fee of about $3 million from its investors on theunspent portion of its buy-out fund. Some investors hadsquawked about paying fees for what they had come to regardas an inactive fund.   &quot;Quality transactions aren't available anymore,&quot; Mr.Shaykin said yesterday, explaining his fund's absence fromthe buyout scene. &quot;Financing is difficult. The world haschanged. We would rather back away from some deals ratherthan put money at risk.&quot;   This fall, Adler andamp; Shaykin told its limited partnerinvestors that it planned to spend $30 million of their moneyfor a minority stake in Multiserve International, asteel-mill servicing company based in Britain. Thatinvestment -- which is due to be completed this week and is adeparture from Adler andamp; Shaykin's traditional emphasis onleveraged buy-outs -- drew protests from investors, who toldMr. Shaykin they hadn't expected their money to be spent insuch a fashion.   &quot;That investment woke the limited partners up,&quot; Mr.Shaykin said. Even though he said he regards Multiserve as &quot;awonderful company,&quot; he said some investors disagreed,precipitating demands that investors be allowed to canceltheir involvement with Adler andamp; Shaykin.   The investor exodus from Adler andamp; Shaykin's 1989 funddoesn't affect any of the companies that the buy-out firmcurrently controls. Most of those companies were bought usingmoney from an earlier buyout fund raised by Adler andamp; Shaykinin 1983, which doesn't figure in the current investor mutiny.While Best Products is in Chapter 11, other acquiredcompanies have generally fared better.   Joy Manufacturing recently completed a public offering,selling stock at more than five times the price that Adler andamp;Shaykin's investors paid to acquire the company in 1986.</TEXT></DOC>
