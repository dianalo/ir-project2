<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-63-0878 </DOCNO><TEXT>The energies of the acoustic phonon modes in a single crystal of /sup7/Li/sub 2/O have been measured in the temperature range 293-1603 K usingthe technique of inelastic neutron scattering. The slopes of the phononenergy dispersion curves as they approach the Brillouin zone centre givevalues for the cubic elastic stiffness constants, C/sub ij/. C/sub 11/is found to undergo a sharp decrease above {approx_equal} 1350 K similarto that observed in structurally related compounds, such as CaF/sub 2/and SrCl/sub 2/, as they undergo a transition to a fast-ion phase. TheReuss and Voigt averaging methods have been used to calculate the temperaturedependence of the adiabatic Young's modulus, shear modulus, bulk modulusand Poisson's ratio of polycrystalline Li/sub 2/O. Estimates of the correspondingisothermal values are obtained using an expression for the linear thermalexpansion coefficient of Li/sub 2/O obtained in this work, together withthermodynamic data available from specific heat measurements. These resultsrepresent the first experimental data describing the elastic propertiesof Li/sub 2/O at elevated temperatures and are important in predictingthe behaviour of this material in its potential role as a tritium breedingblanket material for future fusion reactors.</TEXT></DOC>
