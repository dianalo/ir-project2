Martin Siegel has atoned by singing to the SEC and U.S. attorney Rudolph Giuliani. We worry that innocent people -- and more importantly, vital economic institutions -- will get trampled in the rush to clear consciences.    In the wake of the &quot;Wall Street scandals,&quot; there certainly is a lot of nonsense running around. Prof. Amitai Etzioni wants to close down &quot;selling options and futures and other such hokum.&quot; Stanley Sporkin, a former SEC enforcement chief lately of the CIA and now a federal judge, judiciously announced a &quot;Greed Gate&quot; in risk arbitrage. A usually serious newspaper explained to its readers, &quot;One of the most basic securities laws maintains that no investor can take advantage of others by using important corporate information before it has been publicly disclosed&quot; -- a notion for good reason rejected by the Supreme Court. It is certainly time to draw some distinctions.    First, the free market for corporate control is by and large a good thing. Last year's 3,300 takeovers, worth $175 billion, added inestimable benefits from more efficient managers, more autonomous divisions, more profits for shareholders. It's wondrous to think of Sen. William Proxmire -- the Golden Fleecer? -- responding to insider trading by entrenching corporate chieftains at the expense of shareholders.    Second, the merger boom was caused by benighted government policies. A decade of inflation drove down asset prices on balance sheets. When inflation ended abruptly, the assets looked a lot better. The result was takeovers. It's now cheaper to buy proven oil than drill for new oil.    Third, the risk arbitrage business is largely a result of the law's limitations on more direct bids for corporations. The Williams Act of 1967 required a bidder to stop accumulating stock at 5% and disclose his purchases. As Henry Manne, law dean at George Mason University, points out, this gave the arbitragers the chance to piggyback on takeovers by buying up shares of the target firm. Bidders began to pay premiums for warehoused shares, and guesses as to the eventual tender price overnight became matters of crucial gossip.    Fourth, securities are bought and sold by an anonymous auction process. Someone makes a bid to buy at one price, and computers or exchange specialists match it with someone else's offer to sell at the same price. Buyer and seller never meet, and make no representations to each other. Markets could not function long if one transaction is valid and another at the same time and price invalid depending on what was later learned about what someone knew.    Fifth, given this reality, what constitutes &quot;inside trading&quot; remains a matter of some confusion. In the Boesky case, for example, the SEC was content to let him unwind his company's market position without revealing that the stocks were about to plunge because of his own agreement with the SEC, which sure looks like inside trading as the public tends to understand it. In the Dirks case, however, the Supreme Court recognized reality in telling the SEC that insider trading required proof of some breach of contractual or fiduciary duty. Under current law, insider trading requires that material, non-public information be stolen or misappropriated.    Sixth, an investment banker often serves his client's interest in tipping the arbs. Bankers are paid to help the client win -- for raiders by getting a bid accepted, for targets by fending off an unwanted suitor. If the tip stimulates arb buying or selling, it can help the client achieve these goals (and in the process help the markets to arrive at a correct value for the security). If the banker's tip helps the client, what has been misappropriated? Interestingly enough, few clients have ever sued banks for divulging confidential information. In the extreme case, what if the client explicitly authorized the tip?    This argument of course doesn't excuse suitcases of cash. If an investment banker takes cash on the side for even perfectly legal work, it's certainly grounds for at least a firing. But curiously, Mr. Siegel seemed to start feeling guilty before this stage was reached. His tipping Mr. Boesky about Martin Marietta's Pac-Man defense against Bendix in 1982 clearly helped his client achieve what it was paying him to achieve.    Interestingly, the arrest charges for Robert Freeman, Richard Wigton and Timothy Tabor cited the bankers for activities that helped their clients fend off raiders by driving up their share prices. Goldman Sachs says that its lawyers are confident that Mr. Freeman did nothing wrong, and plans to pay for his legal defense. At some point someone, perhaps Mr. Freeman, will refuse to sign the usual consent decree and make the courts decide again what is and is not insider trading. In other words:    Seventh, under the common law, the accused are entitled to a presumption of innocence. </TEXT></DOC>
