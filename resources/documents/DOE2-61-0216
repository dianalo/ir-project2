These streams were analyzed for heavy metals, organics,dioxins, furans, as NOx, and inorganic acids. Leaching tests were performedon the ash. The results indicated that the PCB was reduced from 5 to100 ppm to less than 1 ppm in the ash, which was the purpose of the removalaction. Although research had indicated that the lead compounds in theash would become insoluble because they would be complexed with carbon,the ash could not be considered non-leachable based on toxicity tests.</TEXT></DOC>
