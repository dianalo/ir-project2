Plant</HEAD><BYLINE>By JANE E. ALLEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The government is fining a New Jerseybrake-shoe manufacturing plant $2.7 million for exposing workers towhat officials say are potentially deadly levels of asbestosdespite signed cleanup agreements, Labor Secretary Elizabeth Doleannounced Thursday.   In addition, her department posted ``imminent danger'' noticesinside the Trenton, N.J., plant Thursday in English and Spanish,warning workers, half of whom are Hispanic, of ongoing hazards totheir health, Mrs. Dole said.   ``I think there is much that can be done,'' she said, to ``getthem out of danger right now.''   Air inside the Friction Division Products Inc. plant, where 158workers produce brake shoes for automobiles and trucks, contains asmuch as 15 times the permissible level of asbestos, governmentinspectors said.   Mrs. Dole said her department lacked authority to shut down thecompany. However, she pledged department cooperation in protectingthe jobs of workers who refused to place themselves at further riskand said she would let New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean know money fromher discretionary fund could be used to help them.   A program of enforcement, including the highest OccupationalSafety and Health Administration fine ever levied solely for ahealth violation, was taken against the company, she said.   The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health hasgathered evidence that at least two of the workers have lungcancer, Mrs. Dole said. She added that two others have developed alung disease and others show evidence of sickness from exposure tothe fibers at work.   Robert Carney, president of the company, was out of town andcould not be reached immediately for comment, a company employeesaid. His firm has 15 days to respond to the citations.   Carney ``is well aware of the OSHA standards. He does know ofthe citations. He has signed agreements,'' in 1987 and 1988, saidAlan C. McMillan, acting assistant secretary of labor foroccupational safety and health. ``In each of these previousagreements, he has committed himself to an abatement schedule,'' hesaid.   McMillan said the plant ``is inches deep in dust which accordingto our findings is in some places 90 percent asbestos.''</TEXT></DOC>
