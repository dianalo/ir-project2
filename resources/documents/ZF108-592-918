Schruben, a USGS geologist whowrote much of the system's code.andM;At the Minerals Information Office, the MRDS system runs on a Macintosh IIwith 4M RAM and a 300M Macdisk hard drive, said Jane Jenness, the USGSgeologist who runs the office.andP;  The MRDS system takes up about 280M usingVersion 1.0.6 of 4th Dimension.andM;&quot;But the minute I go the Version 2.0, it'll jump to 350M,&quot; Schruben said.andM;The system has a Mac II 13-inch RGB color monitor, an Apple Laser Writer Plusprinter and a Hewlett-Packard Co. 7585B plotter, Jennes said.andM;&quot;We decided to use the Mac because of its graphics capabilities,&quot; Jennesssaid.andM;Jenness said she had never worked with computers before this application, butsaid the MRDS system &quot;is extremely easy to use, with the Mac windowing systemand 4th Dimension.andP;  I totally learned the system during my first week on thejob.&quot;andM;The MRDS, one of nine data themes in the ROCS system, is a mineral depositdatabase consisting of more than 84,000 records of deposits and occurrencesthroughout the world, Jenness said.andP;  Most records include information onlocation, commodities, geology, production, reserves and bibliographic data,she said.andM;The MRDS contains a USGS commodity specialists file, a projects file thatlists all the projects the agency is working on, and information about theareas the USGS is assessing for mineral deposits.andM;The MRDS is available for three hardware platforms: Prime minicomputers, IBMCorp. PCs and compatibles and Macintoshes.andP;  The idea for the MRDS originatednearly 20 years ago as a data file on mineral deposits for use in developingmodels that could be useful for predicting mineral occurrences.andP;  The MRDS wasoriginally named the Computerized Resource Information Bank.andM;The USGS routinely gathers data for the system as part of its mineralresource studies.andP;  The USGS concentrates its data gathering on commodity andgeologic data for mineral deposits that are useful to regional mineralresource assessments and reconnaissance exploration, agency officials said.andM;The Minerals Information Office is a cooperative venture of the USGS and theBureau of Mines and is the primary federal clearinghouse for inquiries aboutmineral resources and mining, Jenness said.andM;The USGS staff has begun to improve and maintain the MRDS database byrestructuring the database and modifying the existing 192-field databasestructure.andP;  The staff will work to develop a bibliographic subfile for theMRDS; develop a general geologic database for the United States; get ageneral federal lands boundary file for the United States; upgrade thesystem's Major Sites subfile; develop map-like plotting capabilities; anddevelop appropriate CD-ROM and optical-disk capabilities, agency officialssaid.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
