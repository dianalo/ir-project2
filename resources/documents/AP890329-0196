Following a constitutional referendum that opened up theone-party system, at least 19 political groups are planning tocontest the monopoly of the National Liberation Front inlegislative and municipal elections due this fall.   The riots in October _ largely directed against the one-partysystem instituted at the end of French colonial rule in 1962 _ left176 dead by official count; government opponents cited figures of500 or more killed. But they brought changes that fundamentallytransformed the structure of the state.   The main architect of these changes was President ChadliBendjedid, who was re-elected to a five-year term in Decemberwithout opposition.   Immediately following his election, Bendjedid opened a campaignfor a new constitution, which eliminated ``socialism'' from thebasic principles of the Algerian state and paved the way for theintroduction of a multi-party system. The constitution was approvedFeb. 24 by 73.4 percent of those voting.   In the current period of transition, the 19 groups _ rangingfrom the Communist Party and Islamic fundamentalists toWestern-oriented liberal and social democratic parties _ areadopting their statutes and future programs.   Abderezak Bouhara, executive secretary of the NationalLiberation Front, said there was no reason why a ``renewed andrevigorated party'' could not confront the democratic opposition ofother groups for the defense of what he called Algeria's``socialist achievements.''   ``The front is perfectly capable of playing the democraticgame,'' he added.   But Ali Belhadj, leader of the Islamic Salvation Front andregarded as one of the unconditional extremists of the Islamicmovement, said, ``We are for the full and unrestricted applicationof Islamic sharia law. Our only constitution is the Koran, and theplace of women is in the home.''   Other political opinions ranged widely. The Rally for Cultureand Democracy demands that Amazigh, the language of the Kabylepeople who have lived in Algeria since before the Arabs arrived, berecognized as a national language of Algeria. The leader of theSocial Democrats, Abderrahmane Adjerid, said, ``We do not only wantto distribute wealth but to create it, notably by encouragingprivate enterprise.''   Some time later this year, an extraordinary congress of theNational Liberation Front will take account of the changes andadopt a policy for the future. Until then, President Bendjedidremains the party's president and one of his close allies,Abdelhamid Mehri, its secretary-general.   An anomoly of the the present period of transition, the rulingparty remains dedicated to socialism and one-party domination.   In fact, rejecting views vigorously expressed by Mehri, theparty congress took a position against the new constitution. Thisreflected the views of the party stalwarts who feared for theirentrenched jobs and positions.   But the party was greatly weakened shortly afterwards by thesimultaneous resignation of all its army members. Many governmentofficials are said to be looking to one of the 19 new parties fortheir future political allegiance.   The new constitution requires that any political group thatrequests it be officially recognized and allowed to take part inthe future elections. The only condition is that the party shoulduphold the constitution itself.   The National Liberation Front's official organ, RevolutionAfricaine, foresaw a plot to liquidate the party, beginning withthe ``probability of an abandonment of the party by itspresident,'' Bendjedid himself.   The chairman of one of the budding new parties said thepresident would form his own party and take into it all those loyalto him.   Sources close to the president, speaking on condition ofanonymity, said it was ``not unlikely'' that those loyal toBendjedid would seek to establish a new party. They said thepresident himself intended to remain above the political turmoil.   Some sources said the simplest solution to the NationalLiberation Front's problems would be to change its name. ButRevolution Africaine commented that there was ``genuine risk of thedisintegration of the state and a danger for the construction ofsocialism in our country.''   This official party view runs close to an open statement ofopposition to Bendjedid.   It is not clear whether the president's adroit maneuvering willenable him to continue in control of the party long enough to takecharge of a new, more liberal, political grouping likely to winmajority support in the Algeria of the future.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Wed AMs, April 5</NOTE></DOC>
