The defendant burst into tears when his mother entered thecourtroom.   Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, is charged with murder and airpiracy in the June 1985 hijacking of a TWA jetliner to Beirut. U.S.Navy diver Robert Stethem, 23, was killed and 39 Americans were heldhostage for 17 days.   Stethem's parents also attended the trial Tuesday. His father,Richard, took notes and his mother, Patricia, watched theproceedings with little show of emotion.   Chief Judge Heiner Mueckenberger told Hamadi's mother, Fatima,that relatives can refuse to testify ``because it's easy to givefalse statements out of love.''   She replied: ``I know that my son is innocent. I know that he'svery young and that we live under terrible conditions'' in Beirut.   Of the case itself, she said: ``I don't know anything about this.I can't read or write.''   Hamadi has admitted taking part in the hijacking but deniedkilling Stethem.   Fatima Hamadi and her 59-year-old husband, Ali Hassan, traveledto Frankfurt from Beirut last week to testify. When she walked intothe courtroom Tuesday, in a black dress with a white shawl coveringher head, Mohammed Hamadi stood up until she was seated in thewitness stand.   He held his hand to his heart and bowed as she began replying toMueckenberger's questions in a soft, shaky voice, then suddenly heburst into tears and dried his eyes with handkerchief.   Those accused of terrorism in the Middle East seldom face trialand it is even rarer for parents of a defendant to appear in court.   Ali Hassan Hamadi testified his son fought with the Shiitemilitia Amal in Beirut ``because war had begun and everyone fought.''   ``Mohammed was injured in the fighting,'' said the father. ``Hewas hit in the head and we all thought we had lost him.''   Asked by Mueckenberger if he thought the young man had recoveredfully from the head injuries, he replied: ``I don't know exactly ifhe's right in his head.'' His son and others in the court laughed atthe response.   Both parents testified in Arabic, which was translated intoGerman by a court interpreter.   The judge asked Ali Hassan Hamadi about the work of Mohammed'solder brother, Abdul Hadi Hamadi, Beirut security chief for theShiite group Hezbollah, which is allied with Iran and is believed tobe an umbrella group for those holding foreign hostages in Lebanon.   ``I know about Amal and I know about Hezbollah, but I don't knowwho works for them and I'm not interested,'' the father said.   He said he lives in Bourj el-Barajneh. The south Beirut districtis a Hezbollah stronghold.   Court records show Mohammed Hamadi was born June 13, 1964. Thefather, when asked the birthdate, said:   ``He was born on Lebanon's Independence Day, Nov. 22, in 1964. Ican remember because it's a holiday and I did not have to work thatday.''   His age at the time of the hijacking _ whether he was an adult _is important in determining the length of the prison sentence ifMohammed Hamadi is convicted.   If it is determined that he was 21 at the time of the hijacking,he faces a maximum sentence of life in prison; if it is found thathe was younger at the time of the crime, the maximum sentence is 15years in prison.   The defendant's Lebanese wife, Najad, said in the spectatorsection, which is separated from the main courtroom by bulletproofglass, wearing a black chador that covered her hair but not herface. They were married in late 1986.   His oldest brother, Adnan, also was present. The father saidAdnan was born ``sometime in 1951'' and all the family's 11 childrenwere delivered at home by midwife.   Mohammed Hamadi was arrested at the Frankfurt airport Jan. 13,1987, after customs agents found liquid explosives in his luggage.The United States requested extradition but West Germany refused,fearing for the lives of two West German hostages held in Beirut atthe time.   Abbas Hamadi, 29, was convicted by a Duesseldorf court in Aprilof planning the kidnappings to gain Mohammed's freedom and wassentenced to 13 years in prison.   He also was arrested at Frankfurt airport in January 1987, twoweeks after his brother. Both West German hostages have beenreleased.</TEXT></DOC>
