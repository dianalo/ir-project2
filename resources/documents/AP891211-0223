And hard times could mean social unrest in an area whereanti-government guerrillas operate.   When the government declared its war Aug. 19, the demand forcoca leaf dried up around Miraflores as traffickers disappeared toavoid arrest. The price of coca base, which is made into cocaine,fell from $660 to $330 a kilogram _ 2.2 pounds. Prices havefluctuated since then and recently were about $475 a kilogram.   Many of Miraflores' residents, who were barely making a livingby growing coca even when prices were high, now say they have beenpushed to the economic brink.   ``We ask ourselves what we're going to do,'' said DavidGonzales, a coca grower. ``I mean, are we going to have to declarewar in order to get enough food to feed our families?''   Authorities estimate 80 percent of Miraflores' 17,000 peopledepend on coca cultivation for their livelihood. The town, 267miles southeast of Bogota near the headwaters of the Vaupes River,can be reached only by air; no roads go out from it to areas wherefarmers could sell other crops, such as corn or rice.   Peasants who work on the small farms owned by big coca producersearn the equivalent of $95 a month, Colombia's minimum wage.   A farmer working his own one or two acres might average $7 for a10-hour day. Most growers in Miraflores work for others and growtheir own coca crops as well.   Authorities estimate 550 to 1,100 pounds of coca leaves areneeded to produce one kilogram of coca base. The amount of leafrequired varies with its quality and with the efficiency of theprocessing.   The anti-narcotics police chief in Miraflores, Lt. EdgarBejarano, said Miraflores' population has decreased 30 percent inthe past three months. He and other officials attributed the exodusto the government's war on traffickers.   ``These days, traffickers are all on the run,'' said JavierEcheverry, the head of the government's agricultural developmentcorporation in the region. ``Since there is no one to buy coca, theprice has fallen.''   Any drop in the Colombian coca supply probably will not affectcocaine availability in the United States, since most coca is grownin neighboring Peru and in Bolivia.   But the Colombian government's war on drugs is almost certain toadd instability in Miraflores and other coca-growing regions inColombia.   Roberto Martinez, a former grower, has managed to stay inMiraflores although he abandoned his 25-acre coca field near thetown when prices of coca first began to fall in 1983 because ofoverproduction.   He got a job as a loader with one of the cargo airlines servingMiraflores.   Martinez said most people who quit cultivating coca had not beenso lucky. The choice is often between going hungry and getting out.   ``They leave, but they don't have anywhere to go,'' he said.``There are no jobs for them anywhere else in Colombia, and many ofthem turn to crime. The problems with coca are generating socialproblems.''   Farmers added that the influence of the Revolutionary ArmedForces of Colombia, the country's oldest and largestanti-government guerrilla group, is likely to grow in the areaalong with the economic misery.   Coca grower Gonzalez said people now are listening to theguerrillas' argument that armed revolution is the only way tobetter their lives.   ``If the government really wants to get rid of the guerrillas,it should do something to help us,'' he said.   Colombia produces only about one tenth of the coca grown in theAndean region, but the Guaviare region encompassing Mirafloresaccounts for 80 percent of Colombian coca.   Since no roads run to Miraflores, nine daily cargo flights, oldpropeller driven planes, are the town's only link to the rest ofColombia.   The planes bring food, liquor, cosmetics _ almost everything theresidents need _ including the gasoline they pour on coca leaves toextract juices.   Another problem for growers is that the planes are bringing farless gasoline than they did three months ago. Bejarano, whosepolice platoon controls the airstrip, said he had cut gasolineshipments to 10,000 gallons from 40,000 gallons in an effort toslow coca base processing.   The move has angered farmers.   ``This is a military dictatorship down here,'' said Gonzalez,surrounded by other growers as he talked to a reporter in a woodenshack that has been converted into a bar.   Almost all of the men who said they grew coca expressed a desireto get out of the business, which they say no longer is profitable,but not much is in store for them.   In boom years, growers made thousands of dollars a month butbeginning in 1983 found themselves trying to eke out a living.   Farmers could not pay their debts, and lenders working for drugtraffickers began settling scores with bullets. That brought in thepolice and army reinforcements and Miraflores suffered a wave ofviolence that left scores of dead every week.   Even with the drop in prices, communities like Miraflores thatcan be reached only by plane, coca is likely to be the principalcrop for years to come.   Farmers in Miraflores say they try to keep growing coca because,as poorly as the crop pays, the alternatives are even worse.   Under its National Rehabilitation Plan, the government set up aprogram to buy corn and other crops from farmers in backward areasand has subsidized them by paying the high cost of air transport tomarkets hundreds of miles away.   But the high production cost of corn and other alternative cropsin isolated areas limits farmers' interest in the program.   Some growers in Miraflores said they will try to get by untilthe price of coca goes back up.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Dec. 17</NOTE></DOC>
