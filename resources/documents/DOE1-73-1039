In this paper the effects of thesenew parameter values on the dynamic performance of the alternator ispresented so that the effects of the proposed changes in parameters dueto mechanical or screening considerations can be readily anticipated.These parameter sensitivity analysis results are presented here for futureuse in optimal superconducting alternator design.</TEXT></DOC>
