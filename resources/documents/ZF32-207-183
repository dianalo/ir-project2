(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Remaining competitive, profitable major challenges for today's playersandM;After showing impressive growth in the 1980s, the third-party maintenance(TPM) market has slowed down considerably, leaving many service companiesfighting to stay afloat.andM;Factors such as pricing wars, vendors trying to protect their installed base,increased reliability of hardware, mergers and acquisitions have taken theirtoll.andM;And while the market is expected to grow by six per cent in 1991, remainingcompetitive and profitable is becoming increasingly more difficult for manyTPM players.andM;&quot;In a market which is heavily driven by price it is still possible to beprofitable if you manage yourself well,&quot; says Andy Hay, president ofTestpoint Technical Services Inc. in Mississauga, Ont.andM;&quot;TPM companies are becoming more focused on specific hardware lines andshying away from servicing a diverse suite of products.&quot;andM;Most analysts are in agreement, however, that the TPM market is going to facesome tough economic times ahead.andM;&quot;What we have at the moment is a small group of players who are stillinvolved in cutting prices,&quot; says Bill Fournier, senior research consultantat Evans Research Corp. in Willowdale, Ont.andM;&quot;The overall maintenance market will grow somewhere between three and fourper cent through 1994, whereas the hardware market will be somewhere betweensix-and-a-half and seven-and-a- half per cent over that same time period.&quot;andM;The reason for this, Fournier explains, is an increase in the reliability ofhardware and a corresponding decrease in maintenance pricing which in turnhas led to a decline for maintenance contracts.andM;&quot;Looking at the market from 1984 through to 1988 shows that revenue growthgenerated from maintenance was significantly higher than overall hardwaresector growth.andM;&quot;This occurred because hardware prices were declining while maintenancepricing remained virtually constant.andP;  The market was ripe for companiesproviding third-party maintenance services.&quot;andM;According to George Bulat, research analyst for International Data Corp. inToronto, &quot;what we're seeing is more and more vendors getting in on the actand developing their own customer service organization.andM;&quot;Dealers are also throwing their hats in while vendors have become moremilitant in protecting their maintenance operations.andM;&quot;Everyone seems to want a piece of the maintenance pie, but with vendors anddealers getting involved TPM companies will have a tougher time beingprofitable.&quot;andM;&quot;Product manufacturers are competing more aggressively to retain theirinstalled base and because of this, discounts are larger and margins arelower,&quot; says Matthew MacFarlane, sales support manager for Digital Equipmentof Canada Ltd.andM;&quot;In addition, the customer base continues to migrate to newer technologieswhich are much more reliable and less costly to maintain.andP;  Because of higherproduct reliability, many customers won't buy service agreements at all.andM;&quot;Instead, they rely on per-call service.andP;  All these factors combine to createa decreased market for the traditional services that TPM's typicallyprovide.&quot;andM;Product reliability is demonstrated by the increase in PC warranty coverage-- expanding from a three-to a six- month to a two-year standard warranty,according to Fournier.andM;&quot;PCs have became reliable to a point where it becomes almost ridiculous insome cases to have a maintenance contract,&quot; he says.andM;&quot;Let's say you had 10 PCs in your department it would be cheaper to buy an11th PC and stick it in the closet until one of the others broke down than itwould to have a maintenance contract for a year,&quot; he says.andM;Hay and others are more optimistic: &quot;I don't think the cost of service isgoing to decrease that much...we'll be there to compete in any case for theservice market.andM;&quot;The service equation has changed with the increased reliability of hardwarebut the ones receiving the most pressure are the manufacturers like DEC, IBMand HP because they just can't support their installed base.andP;  TPM companiesstill represent a viable alternative to the vendors.andM;&quot;I think that vendors are going to be pushed by their customer base to play alittle straighter when negotiating maintenance agreements,&quot; Hay says.andM;David Lewis, sales manager for Brains II Inc. in Don Mills, Ont., an IBMmid-range TPM company says, &quot;We've noticed that IBM in the past few years hasbecome very competitive in their rate structures (by) trying to gain andmaintain account control.andM;&quot;There is no question that the market is becoming more competitive.andP;  IBM isproviding extended warranty on products, locking customers into long-termlease programs, bundling services and eliminating the need for customers toshop around.&quot;andM;Many computer vendors, however, do not have the infrastructure to support andservice their products.andM;An area of high growth in the TPM market is the mail-order computerdistribution chains, according to Bob Dawes, vice-president of marketing forBell Technical Services in Toronto.andM;&quot;You've got companies like Dell and Acer coming into play and they don't haveservice organizations.andP;  A few years ago those companies couldn't make inroadwith the Financial Post 500 companies.andM;&quot;But they managed to crack that market by providing onsite warranty serviceusually provided by a TPM company,&quot; he says.andM;As for maintaining a competitive edge in the future, Dawes says, &quot;customersare looking for more than just hardware maintenance.andP;  They want to be able tophone one number and get service, whatever the problem.andM;&quot;You can even take it so far as to mean facilities management whether it'syour phone system, copier, fax machine or PC is down you phone one number andthe service company fixes or arranges to have it fixed.andM;&quot;That's where the value is for the end-user, they don't want to have sixservice contracts from six different companies.andP;  That's where the TPMcompanies are going to have to evolve to stay afloat, expand their serviceofferings to include end-user training, software support, hotline support,etc.&quot;andM;Dawes sees a more ominous trend, in the loss of mid-sized TPM companies.andM;&quot;I see the medium-sized companies disappearing,&quot; he says.andP;  &quot;They'll either beacquired by bigger players or go out of business.andP;  The reason for this isthat they don't offer national support widely enough to attract the largercontracts.andM;&quot;You're still going to have the small regional shops which provide servicefor a small area and for a specific product base and national companiesproviding coast-to-coast coverage on a wide range of products.&quot;andM;To this Hay adds, &quot;If we took a cautious approach, some people within themarket are looking to consolidate because at a certain size companies find itdifficult to cover fixed costs.&quot;andM;Another consideration for Dawes is the use and implementation of technologywithin TPM companies.andM;&quot;Profits can be made but companies are going to get wiser about managingtheir business.andP;  They're going to be more cognizant about keeping theiradministrative costs down.andP;  That involves using technology internally whetherit's dispatch systems or logistics.andM;&quot;We've realized we can't be everything to everybody and decided to focus ondeveloping a portfolio of services.andM;&quot;There is room for growth but in very focused vertical niche markets, forexample hospitality or real estate management,&quot; he says.andM;Most TPM companies recognize that they cannot succeed based on TPM revenuealone, says MacFarlane.andM;&quot;The successful companies will be those who integrate their TPM activitiesinto a larger strategy of 'account partnership' via multi-vendor support.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
