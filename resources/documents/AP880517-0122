Two nationwide public opinion polls released this week showedDukakis leading Bush, and the two men swap charges almost routinelyas they make their campaign rounds.   In another sure sign that the nominating hostilities are fading,both Bush and Dukakis have begun making plans to help retirecampaign debts left over from rivals' campaigns.   Jackson, the only other active candidate on either side,complained during his Oregon campaign that he was not getting thesupport from party leaders that he deserves.   But even so, if he intends to play a spoiler to Dukakis, he'skept his intentions well hidden.   The two Democrats held a private meeting when their pathscrossed in New Jersey on Sunday, and the Massachusetts governorsounded anything but worried about the prospects for party unitythis fall.   Dukakis spent much of the past week behaving like thefront-runner he is, meeting with Democratic congressional leadersin Washington, conferring with South Africa bishop Desmond Tutu andtrying to raise doubts about Bush.   ``I don't believe you drop indictments against suspected drugrunners and murderers,'' he said in repponse to reports that theUnited States would drop drug charges against Manuel Noriega if thePanamanian dictator agreed to leave his country.   ``I think before we start talking about dropping indictments andmaking deals, the American people deserve a full explanation ofwhat kind of relationship this administration has had withNoriega,'' Dukakis said.   But Dukakis also ran into heckling by gay political activists inCalifornia who challenged a Massachusetts policy that gives themlow priority in determining suuitablity to be foster parents.``Bigot,'' shouted one man, while another yelled, ``You'reanti-gay. Why don't you admit it.''   The vice president also launched a few attacks at Dukakis, andgingerly began setting himself apart from President Reagan as heneared the end of his primary campaign.   He said Dukakis was ``an extremely liberal Democrat'' whoseelection would cause a ``radical swing'' in defense policies.   As for the president, whom he has served loyally for sevenyears, Bush said, ``I don't think we've been doing enough toprotect our environment in recent years. We need to do more,''particularly on the subject of acid rain.   Bush's last remaining active opponent, Robertson, officiallyabandoned his effort on Monday, but seemed to indicate interest inanother run in 1992 if Bush is defeated this fall.   Robertson, who became known to millions through his religiousbroadcasting, resumed his leadership of his Christian BroadcastingNetwork on Tuesday.</TEXT></DOC>
