The new policy went into effect slowly Tuesday, the day after itwas announced by Immigration and Naturalization Service officialswho said they wanted to discourage Central Americans from enteringthe United States with ``frivolous'' applications for asylum.   By Tuesday afternoon, only 45 Central Americans, half fromNicaragua, were under review while 200 others waited to be processed.   Two State Department advisers recommended denying asylum to 25 ofthe 45, and the others were still under consideration, INS spokesmanMario Ortiz said. He said the INS decided to detain at least 12 ofthe 25 pending deportation hearings.   INS District Director Omer Sewell said the addition of 500federal workers in the Brownsville area, the main entry point forCentral American asylum seekers, will help as the new process isphased in during the next few weeks.   But critics say it already is operating at inhumane speed, andthey have expressed outrage at INS plans to hold rejected applicantsin tents erected inside a minimum-security prison.   The Catholic Bishops of Texas charged that they foresaw ``thecreation of the largest concentration camp on U.S. soil since theincarceration of Japanese-Americans during World War II.''   Only immigrants who can show persecution are entitled to asylum;those who come to better themselves economically can be deported.The INS maintains that most Central Americans arriving in southTexas do not qualify for refugee status.   Under the new plan, asylum applicants may get an answer on thesame day they apply, but they are subject to immediate arrest anddetention if denied asylum.   Before Tuesday, applications could take weeks to process, andaliens were released on their own recognizance while they awaitedappeals or deportation.   The INS began erecting tents at its rural Port Isabel ServiceProcessing Center here in case the number of detainees at thefacility exceeds bed space. The agency said as many as 5,000 couldbe detained in large circus-like tents within the 315-acre facilitythat is surrounded by a 7-foot fence topped with barbed wire.   Many of the applicants showing up at the center Tuesday wereunaware that they were subject to arrest if their cases were denied.   ``We didn't know about it,'' said Luis Vasquez, 29, from ElSalvador, adding he would take his chances anyway.   ``I just can't go back to Nicaragua,'' said Manuela Diaz, whostarted crying while talking about conditions in her homeland.   The applicants entering the facility generally paid littleattention to six people who were fasting across the road from thecenter in protest of the new procedures.   The three Salvadorans and three Roman Catholic nuns from SouthTexas said they would remain there until the government grantedregugee status to Salvadorans and halted military aid to thatcountry.   The Texas Catholic Conference said the new policy ``ignores thefacts of life in Central America that are causing the massive influxof refugees to our country.''   ``The INS statement speaks of `frivolous' applications.Apparently any applications by people who have suffered dreadfullyfrom civil war are frivolous,'' it said in a statement.   Brownsville immigration attorney Linda Yanez said 15 attorneyshad formed a group called the Cameron County Pro Bono Project todefend those denied asylum.   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, called the new policy a ``real stepforward'' but termed it a ``short-term solution to what may not be ashort-term problem.''   ``The INS obviously believes it can reduce the flow of CentralAmerican immigration by sending a `no-free-ride' signal. That may bethe case,'' Bentsen said. ``But we've got 40,000 contras in Hondurasand the prospect of a detention camp in South Texas may not beenough to deter them from making the trip north.''</TEXT></DOC>
