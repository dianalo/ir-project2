(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   With no chance of winning the Republicanpresidential nomination, his campaign curtailed, and his formerfree spending shackled, Pat Robertson is trying to map out his roleat the party's national convention _ and beyond.   The former television evangelist confidently says the party willlisten to his conservative message, but other political analystsbelieve Robertson has squandered his strength with a string of poorprimary showings.   All agree that his real effect on the party is likely to come in1990 and 1992.   Robertson believes his active presence at the New Orleansconvention will ensure that the likely nominee, Vice PresidentGeorge Bush, will heed the conservative position on the issues.   ``I want to ask George Bush questions... Is he going to be asfervent for the Contras... as Ronald Reagan? Will he be truthfullyas fervent for tax cuts as Ronald Reagan?'' Robertson said Tuesdayafter finishing third in the Illinois primary behind Bush andKansas Sen. Bob Dole.   Robertson is claiming his forces will make themselves felt inthe convention platform and rules committees. He said he would liketo see the 1984 platform resurrected _ ``It was a good,conservative platform.''   That platform endorsed constitutional amendments to ban abortionand to allow prayer in school, and opposed the Equal RightsAmendment and any tax increases.   Robertson has spent nearly $25 million on a campaign that haswon 17 delegates. The federal spending cap for the primaries is $27million. Some longtime Robertson watchers question the amount ofclout that gives him.   ``He has no chance to win the nomination. He never did. Hiscandidacy is irrelevant in terms of the nomination,'' said LarrySabato, a professor of political science at the University ofVirginia and longtime observer of state and national politics.   Though Robertson may have some effect on the party's platformand procedural votes in the convention, ``he lost a great deal ofclout because of his pitiful performance in the South,'' Sabatosaid.   Robertson won none of the 14 Southern and border states holdingprimaries or caucuses on the March 8 Super Tuesday. He placed thirdin his home state of Virginia and was third in his hometown ofVirginia Beach.   Richard Pinsky, the national field director for Americans ForRobertson, said even though the candidate will not be contestingany of the primary states and will be taking his scaled-backcampaign only to states holding caucuses, he expects Robertson tocome to the convention with 150 to 200 delegates.   ``He has a substantial bloc of votes behind him,'' said WilliamWhitehurst, a professor of history at Old Dominion University andformer Virginia 2nd District representative for 19 years. ``What itboils down to is what does he want in the way of price to keep himin the party fold?''   Robertson met with Republican National Committee Chairman FrankFahrenkopf on Tuesday to discuss what the candidate called``housekeeping details'' surrounding the convention. Robertsonwould not say whether he asked the party for a chance to addressthe convention during prime time.   ``Hopefully we could be in that kind of time slot,'' said ConnieSnapp, Robertson's director of communications, ``but that was notdiscussed.''   It's difficult to predict what Robertson might get, saidWhitehurst. ``His showing has been sufficiently weak that he can'tmake too many demands,'' he said. Whitehurst said he does not seeRobertson being offered a Cabinet post or a place on the ticket.   ``He needs to wait for friendlier times,'' Whitehurst said.``And acquire the political maturity he desperately needs.''   Sabato and Merle Black, political scientist from the Universityof North Carolina and another commentator on Southern politics, seeRobertson's long-term effect on the party coming at the state andlocal level.   In many caucus states, Robertson's people, the majority of thempolitical newcomers, have taken control of the party at theprecinct level.   ``Although Robertson's viability as a candidate seems to bedissipating, I think we'll see the impact of his candidacy throughthese delegates, partly at the convention, partly in local andstate politics as well. This may be played out over years,'' saidBlack.   ``These new people are part of the party and are not fightingthe party. We are sending a signal at the convention that we aresticking with the party,'' Snapp said. ``And that the party isgoing to need us.''</TEXT></DOC>
