The next day, House Democrats rose and gave the Speaker a standing ovation. These are the same House Democrats who demand that Attorney General Meese resign if the merest puff of ethical smoke blows out of the independent counsel's office. But they are disinclined to look into the affairs of the man who is second in the line of presidential succession.    Instead, they will punish Common Cause. &quot;It kills them on the House side,&quot; one aide to the Democratic leadership said. We may assume that the House leadership didn't need to vote on its inclination to crush Common Cause's main legislative proposal, which would extend to Congress the coverage of the federal ethics law that now applies to the rest of government.    In a letter to the Ethics Committee, Common Cause asked for the creation of an outside counsel to investigate the Speaker. Common Cause noted that &quot;a series of newspaper reports&quot; (which have appeared in the Washington Times, Washington Post, and this newspaper) have raised questions about a book written by the Speaker that was published by the man who is the largest recipient of the Speaker's campaign funds.    Speaker Wright received an unusually generous royalty of 55% on the 117-page, 75-chapter book, &quot;Reflections of a Public Man,&quot; priced at $5.95. So far he has netted more than $60,000 in royalties. Common Cause says ethical questions would be raised if the practice &quot;amounted to a conversion of campaign funds for personal use,&quot; a violation of House rules.    House rules also prohibit any Member from accepting more than $100 in gifts from anyone &quot;with an interest in legislation.&quot; The Journal's Brooks Jackson has named two lobbyists who made bulk purchases of the Speaker's slim tome. The Teamsters' PAC bought 1,000 copies in 1986. It now develops that John White, a former chairman of the Democratic Party who is now a lobbyist, spoke about &quot;Reflections of a Public Man&quot; with the Speaker's deputy chief of staff and placed an order for 1,200 copies. Since a 55% royalty is far above that normally given authors, orders from lobbyists could be seen as circumvention of House rules.    Common Cause also asked that an outside counsel look into accusations that Mr. Wright sought &quot;special treatment . . . for constituents and party campaign contributors&quot; from federal regulators. Three savings and loan executives on whose behalf the Speaker intervened have been indicted on fraud charges.    The Speaker's office lashed out at Common Cause, calling it &quot;the handmaiden of a partisan, political initiative&quot; and the accusations &quot;an attempt to smear Mr. Wright's name and blacken his reputation.&quot;    Previous Speakers did not react in such a defiant manner when questions were raised about their behavior. Three 19th-century Speakers, aware their powerful position made it difficult for their affairs to be probed, insisted on independent inquiries into their conduct. In 1879, for instance, Speaker Samuel J. Randall was accused in a letter to a newspaper of misappropriating government funds. Randall gave up the Speaker's chair the day the letter appeared, and had a five-member committee appointed with broad powers. He didn't resume his position until he had been cleared. By contrast, Speaker Wright attacks the motives of Common Cause, a group never known for its Republican ties, and allows his associates to threaten it with political retribution.    The House of Representatives, where some 98% of the Members ride the PAC trail back into office, is looking more and more like a shoddy place. Its power is beyond challenge, and so its power has turned to forms of political abuse -- of its own employees, of the opposition, of any group, such as Common Cause, that raises a voice against it. The Economist magazine concluded this week that the House &quot;has fallen under a party hegemony whose duration is rivaled hardly anywhere outside the communist world.&quot;    One of the most used phrases in Washington political life is &quot;the House leadership.&quot; Leadership of the House of Representatives always has been a complex business, mixing partisanship with some governing vision of the national interest. It may be said that until recently, the House leadership stood for more than it does now. </TEXT></DOC>
