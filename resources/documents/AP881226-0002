The Washington Post reported Monday that Barry was in a cityhotel room with former city employee Charles Lewis on Thursday whentwo detectives were called back from an attempt to make anundercover drug buy from Lewis.   The detectives had gone to the hotel to investigate a complaintfrom hotel officials that Lewis offered drugs to a hotel maid. Theyleft the hotel after ``somebody called them back downstairs,'' thePost reported, quoting city government sources.   It was not revealed who called the detectives away or why theyleft when they did, the paper said.   The detectives were working from the 3rd District under Spurlock,sources told the Post. The paper reported that Assistant Chief IssacM. Fulwood told officers that Spurlock offered to lie to reporterswho called him about the actions of the detectives. However, Fulwoodlater denied making the statement.   Spurlock, asked about the report that he offered to lie about theprobe, said, ``I would arrest your mother or my mother if I caughtthem doing a crime.''   Police are conducting an internal investigation on whether Lewiswas involved in any drug activity, how police handled the complaintand why the mayor was at the hotel, the Post said.   The Post, in Tuesday's editions, quoted sources as saying thatthe two detectives had given conflicting accounts of their actionsto police investigators. The paper identified the two as PierreMitchell and Robert Thompson and said both had previously workedoff-duty at the Ramada Inn where Lewis stayed. However, the Postsaid it could not be determined how their accounts differed.   The paper also said Tuesday that Barry had acknowledged through aspokesman that he had called police officials during the weekend toask them when they would conclude their investigation. The spokesmansaid the mayor denied trying to influence the probe.   Traces of cocaine were discovered in Lewis' hotel room after hechecked out on Friday, although the tests did not indicate whetherthe cocaine had been in the room recently.   The Post quoted sources as saying Barry visited the hotel sixtimes last week. The mayor acknowledged through a spokesman that hevisited Lewis at the hotel at least three times, but the mayor hasdenied any wrongdoing.   ``I would never knowingly associate with anybody using drugs ordealing with drugs,'' the mayor said through a spokesman. ``Under nocircumstances would I associate with anybody doing this.''   Meanwhile, an elected member of the city Advisory NeighborhoodCommission called Monday for an independent investigation.   ``I'm not totally sure about the police department'sinvestigation in it because, remember, the chief (of police) isappointed by the mayor,'' said Virgil Thompson. ``I want noinvolvement of the police department, the city council or theexecutive branch of government.''</TEXT></DOC>
