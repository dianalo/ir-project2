Magnet systems whosematerials fall within acceptable limits for these two problems are considered.The comparative degradation and activation analyses led to the followingrecommendations for magnet systems operating in a fusion radiation fluxof 10{sup 10} neutrons per square centimeter per second: aluminum alloyas the structural material; V{sub 3}Ga as the superconducting material;aluminum as the stabilizing material; and glass fiber reinforced plasticas the insulating material.</TEXT></DOC>
