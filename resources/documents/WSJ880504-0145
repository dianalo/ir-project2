Staley, a corn processor and food service concern, said its board unanimously rejected as &quot;inadequate&quot; Tate andamp; Lyle's amended $1.38 billion, or $35-a-share, offer. Tate andamp; Lyle shareholders yesterday approved the offer, which was made last week; the offer expires at 12:01 a.m. EDT next Wednesday.    Tate andamp; Lyle is a London-based sugar refiner.    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Staley also disclosed that it has initiated discussions with several banks concerning a possible recapitalization.    The move could take the form of a substantial cash or stock dividend, a self tender offer or an offer to swap or buy back common shares outstanding, Staley said. The company said in its filing that it also is considering a leveraged buy-out, or the sale of all or part of Staley to a third party. In a leveraged buy-out, a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely with borrowing. Ultimately the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or the sale of its assets.    A Staley spokesman declined to elaborate on the company's plans other than to say that all of the options were still open. The spokesman also declined to identify the third parties taking part in discussions.    Staley rejected as inadequate Tate andamp; Lyle's original $32-a-share offer April 21. The company also said at that time that it was meeting with unidentified prospective buyers.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Staley closed at $38.375, up 50 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
