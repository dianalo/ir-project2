(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Eastern Airlines pilots are calling off theirsympathy strike and offering to return to work, dealing a stunningblow to Machinists on strike against the carrier since March.   The air line's flight attendants also voted to end their walkout.   The leaders of Eastern's union pilots voted Wednesday to endtheir walkout, although it remained unclear whether Eastern wouldwelcome back all of the more than 2,200 pilots still on strike.   The decision by the Air Line Pilots' Association instantlycrushed the solidarity of the strike begun by the Machinists anduntil now supported by the pilots and union flight attendants.   On Wednesday, Local 553 Transport Workers of America informedEaster Airlines of the union's immediate and unconditional returnto work.   ``This was a very difficult decision, but one made in the bestinterests of the flight attendants,'' said Mary Jane Barry,president of TWU Local 553.   The Machinists vowed to continue their walkout.   ``We're not calling this thing off,'' said union vice presidentJohn Peterpaul. Calls to the flight attendants' union were notreturned, but the attendants traditionally have honored Machinistspicket lines even when pilots have crossed them.   The 20-member Master Executive Council of the Eastern pilots'group said President Bush's veto of legislation establishing aspecial congressional panel to propose a solution to the strikeconvinced the pilots there was no end to the strike in sight andthat returning to work was the best way to protect their jobs.   ``It's a very interesting development,'' Miami-based Easternsaid in a statement. ``Our only regret is that it didn't comeearlier and we could have avoided all the trauma that has come toEastern Airlines.''   There currently are no openings for pilots at the airline, whichnow has about 1,800 fliers, the company said. But it indicatedthere could be slots in the future, which would be filled in theorder in which pilots returned to work _ except in cases wherepilots with experience on specific types of aircraft are needed.   Eastern said striking pilots ``will be recalled as jobs comeopen in the future'' and invited them to sign the recall list.   Eastern has been hiring replacement pilots and using severalhundred union pilots who crossed picket lines. The airline has beenplanning to reorganize as a carrier about 85 percent of its formersize.   ``They've got all the pilots they need,'' Paul Karos, an airlineanalyst at First Boston Corp., said Wednesday. ``The strike hasbeen mainly symbolic.''   Technically, under the Railway Labor Act which governs airlinecontract disputes, only the Machinists are involved in afull-fledged strike. The pilots and Eastern's union flightattendants have been honoring Machinist pickets in legal sympathystrikes.   The Machinists went on strike after refusing to agree to ademand for $150 million in concessions on wages, work rules andother issues sought by Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern's parentcompany, Texas Air Corp. The Machinists said later they would agreeto similar or greater concessions if Lorenzo would sell Eastern,but sale attempts have fallen through.   The pilots' union has a history of crossing the picket lines ofother unions, limiting the effectiveness of airline strikes. But itstood with the Machinists until Wednesday, giving organized laboran important boost even though in recent months Eastern has beenable to expand operations with replacements.   Duke Jack, spokesman for the local ALPA branch, said Bush's vetowas the final straw in leading the pilots to drop the strike.   ``President Bush at the eleventh hour decided working peopleweren't that important in his 1,000 points of light. When he vetoedthat (the resolution) we took a look around and said we didn't haveanywhere else to go,'' he said.   The decision to end the strike was announced by Skip Copeland,who in August replaced Jack Bavis as head of the Eastern pilotsafter Bavis advocated returning to work.   Copeland said the pilots have been instructed to contact thecompany about returning to work.   ``The time has come now to go back, rebuild Eastern and get onwith our lives and professions,'' Copeland said.   But Don Hanson, an 11-year Machinist and who was picketingoutside Miami airport on Wednesday, said, ``As long as FrankLorenzo is at the helm, I'll never go back to work. There's nofuture with the man. The man doesn't treat his people right.''</TEXT></DOC>
