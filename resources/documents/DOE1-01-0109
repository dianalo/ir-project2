<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-01-0109 </DOCNO><TEXT>We report for the first time the optical absorption and photovoltaic characteristicsof thin films of Cu/sub 2/SnS/sub 3/. Films obtained by the direct evaporationof the synthesized compound were observed to be deficient in copper,while those grown in an atmosphere of copper vapour were observed tobe more stoichiometric. Both sets of films are characterised by indirectand direct absorption edge properties. The indirect absorption edgesare at 1.065 and 1.510 eV, while the direct band edges are at 1.658 and1.770 eV for the copper deficient and stoichiometric films respectively.The stoichiometric film is characterised by p-type semiconducting propertieswhile a Schottky type solar cell developed from it is observed to havepotential photovoltaic characteristics.</TEXT></DOC>
