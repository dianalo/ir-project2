Thismethod consists of correcting the number of generators to be operatedand operation patterns of storage systems, one by one, to optimally saverunning costs based on the optimal start/stop patterns of generatorson the basis that the operation status of storage systems is set to zero.Although this method is not always optimal, it makes it possible to obtaina solution within a practical calculating time. Applying this methodand the D.P. (dynamic programming) method, which is a strict method,to six cases of seven generators and four storage systems under an 8-hourmodel load resulted in the following: the solutions from three out ofthe six cases corresponded to one another, and; in the remaining threecases, the number of starting generators failed to correspond by onlyone in one time band. The average calculation time required in this methodis about 1/600 that of the D.P. method. (5 figs, 6 tabs, 11 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
