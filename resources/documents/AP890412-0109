Gun importers have applications to bring in 965,000 of theweapons pending at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms,according to spokesman Dick Pedersen.   The import suspension was imposed March 14 after public andpolice outcries over the increased use of the weapons such assemiautomatic versions of AK-47s and Uzi carbines in drug-relatedviolence, and the January slayings of five schoolchildren inStockton, Calif..   The suspension covered some 400,000 weapons including about300,000 for which import permits already had been approved. Lastweek, the administration expanded the suspension to cover 240,000separate weapons.   ``We noticed the increase in these showing up in crimes, anincrease in demand, and we reacted to it,'' Pedersen said. ``Themain thing is that we might be nipping the semiautomaticassault-type rifle in the bud rather than have millions of themflooding in here.''   Nevertheless, gun importers are continuing to submitapplications, he said Tuesday.   ``It appears there have been a lot more applications that camein after the ban,'' Pedersen said.   The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms is required by lawto permit imports only of weapons suitable or adaptable to``sporting purposes,'' and it is studying the use of thesemiautomatic rifles to determine how they are being used. Thereview should take two to three months more months.   Despite the uproar over such weapons, FBI crime statisticsreveal that most murders by firearms are still committed by peoplewielding handguns. Of the 17,859 murders committed nationwide in1987, 10,556 were committed with firearms of which 7,807 werehandguns, according to the FBI.   Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman Con Dougherty saysthat increasing numbers of powerful and sophisticated handguns suchas the 9mm semiautomatic, particularly guns such as the Uzi pistol,are being confiscated during arrests.   Nevertheless, Pedersen said it is extremely unlikely that thecurrent import suspension on rifles will be expanded to anyhandguns.   ``Handguns are used in sport, in target shooting, extensively,''Pedersen said. ``That's negligible as far as assault weapons areconcerned.''   Many local and federal police agencies have recently begun toarm themselves with foreign-made 9mm semiautomatic handguns, hesaid.   It would be up to Congress to make any changes in theavailability of such guns, he said.   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, has introduced a bill that wouldplace some of the same restrictions on both semiautomaticmachine-style pistols and assault-style rifles that are now imposedon automatic weapons, including FBI background checks on purchasersand fingerprinting, but not the $200 fee charged to owners ofmachine guns, according to the senator's spokeswoman, Nancy Coffey.   Among the semiautomatic handguns that would be restricted ifMetzenbaum's bill passes are the Uzi pistol, the Ingram Mac 10 andMac 11 and the Tec 9 and Tec 22, she said.   About 231,000 foreign handguns, including semiautomatic weapons,were imported in 1986, the last year for which Pedersen had data.There was no breakdown for the number of semiautomatic handguns, hesaid.   The number of hanguns being imported has ``been decreasing overthe years,'' while more than 1 million handguns have been produceddomestically each year, he said.   In 1982, some 332,000 handguns were imported, followed by411,000 in 1983, 341,000 in 1984 and 229,000 in 1985.   Greg Risch of Handgun Control Inc. said police are findingassault-style handguns that ``have clips that hold 30, 40,sometimes 50 rounds of ammunition, but yet are still fairlyconcealable, as opposed to an assault rifle that is moreconcealable than a hunting rifle, but still a large size.''</TEXT></DOC>
