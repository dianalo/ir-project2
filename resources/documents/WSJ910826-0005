The trial, which began last week in Louisville federalcourt, comes nearly 10 years after workers sued Ford claimingit neglected to pay them supplemental unemployment fundsduring layoffs in the early 1980s. Plaintiffs' attorneys sayFord owes the workers $14 million in benefits plus interest-- a total of more than $35 million.</LP><TEXT>   According to their 1982 complaint, the approximately 2,000workers were entitled, under a union contract, to 95% oftheir after-tax weekly pay for a specified period of timeduring layoffs. The company was obligated to supplement stateand federal unemployment benefits so that workers wouldreceive that amount. But in the early 1980s, when workersfrom a Ford plant in Jefferson County, Ky., tried to collecttheir supplemental benefits called &quot;SUB&quot; funds, Ford didn'thave sufficient funds, the workers allege.   The workers claimed in their suit, which has beencertified as a class action, that the company had mistakenlypaid more than $250 million in supplemental unemploymentfunds to another group of Kentucky workers who were entitledto supplemental funding from a federal benefit called theTrade Readjustment Allowance or TRA. Some of those workerswere getting up to 150% of their take-home pay duringlayoffs.   Ford's SUB fund was able to recoup about $138 million ofthe $250 million through paycheck deductions from workers wholater returned to their jobs, according to Charles Zimmerman,one of the attorneys for the allegedly underpaid workers.   But some workers who did not get their jobs back did notreturn the SUB funds to Ford. This group, anotherapproximately 2,000 workers, has also sued Ford and UAWclaiming they do not have to repay the SUB funds. Their casewill also be decided during the trial under way in Louisvillefederal court. Their attorney, Frank Haddad, of Louisville,could not be reached for comment.   Both groups of workers sued the UAW for not preventingFord from paying out SUB funds to workers allegedly notentitled to them. The group that received the funds isfighting the repayment because they claim it was not theirfault for getting the funds.   &quot;We feel we should prevail and that we did everything wecould to protect our people,&quot; said Herbert L. Segal, aLouisville lawyer for the UAW. &quot;And now we seem to be caughtin the crossfire between two sets of plaintiffs, one set thatwas overpaid and the other set that was underpaid -- boththrough no fault of ours.&quot;   A spokesman for Ford said: &quot;We believe there is no meritto the claim that Ford made overpayments to some employees,which depleted the SUB fund. The purpose of the SUB fund wasto make up the difference between state and federalunemployment benefits and approximately 95% of a laid-offemployee's pay during a weekly period, if the fund hadsufficient assets. The company made payments from the fund toemployees based on the state and federal benefits that wereavailable at the time of the payment. The TRA was a federalbenefit that subsequently became available but was notavailable when a number of the SUB payments were made.&quot;   ---   TIME MAGAZINE FIGHTS Scientologists' efforts to subpoenareporter.   The magazine asked a federal judge in New York to rulethat the reporter, who wrote a Time cover story in Mayentitled &quot;Scientology: The Cult of Greed,&quot; can't be requiredto testify in a suit filed by Scientologists against theInternal Revenue Service. Time also asked Judge LawrenceMcKenna to issue sanctions against attorneys for theScientologists, claiming that their repeated subpoenas ofRichard Behar were meritless and meant to harass him.   The religious organization, founded by the late L. RonHubbard, wants the IRS to turn over certain documents thatthe Scientologists say will show that they have been treatedunfairly by the agency. In court filings, the Scientologistssaid they want to question Mr. Behar because his article wascited in the testimony of an IRS investigator. TheScientologists said in the court filing that they want to askMr. Behar about information that the group &quot;believes to havebeen intentionally omitted from the article.&quot;   Lawyers for Time and Mr. Behar, however, said in courtpapers that the latest subpoena &quot;is part of a campaign toharass a reporter who investigated and wrote about the Churchof Scientology.&quot; The attorneys said the federal subpoena isthe third that Mr. Behar has received from the Scientologistsin the past two months. In the first two cases, which involvedifferent Scientology suits against the IRS, federal judgesruled that Mr. Behar doesn't have to testify. A New Yorkstate court subpoena in a separate case also has been issuedagainst Mr. Behar.   The attorneys for Time said that under the First Amendmentand New York state law protecting reporters, Mr. Behar can'tbe forced to testify. Moreover, they also said that Mr.Behar's article and other information he may have areirrelevant to the Scientologists' suit against the IRS.   The Scientologists' &quot;true purpose . . . is to discredit areporter who has written negatively about Scientology,&quot; theTime attorneys said in their court filing.   Mr. Behar said in a court filing that the subpoena, ifenforced, could deter reporters from investigatingcontroversial stories.   Kendrick Moxon, an attorney for the Church of Scientology,said Mr. Behar should be required to testify because the IRSpartly relied on information from him in rejecting theScientologists' request for documents. &quot;The IRS specificallysaid that it was in communication with Behar,&quot; said Mr.Moxon, of the firm Bowles andamp; Moxon in Hollywood. &quot;It lookslike there's some real collusion going on between the newsmedia and the IRS.&quot;   Mr. Moxon said the request for sanctions is &quot;outrageous&quot;because the subpoena pertains to information relevant to thecase.   Judge McKenna set a hearing for Sept. 13 to decide whetherMr. Behar can be ordered to testify.   ---   CROWN CORK andamp; SEAL SETTLES sex discrimination suit for upto $4.3 million.   The suit was filed in 1970 by female employees whocontended that Crown Cork andamp; Seal Co., a Philadelphia-basedmetals company, maintained a policy of segregating jobcategories by sex. The suit named both the company and SheetMetal Workers Union, Local 266, but the entire settlementamount will be paid by Crown pending final court approval inNovember.   &quot;I think everybody's happy with the settlement,&quot; a companyspokesman said.   Plaintiffs' lawyer Alan M. Lerner, of the Philadelphia lawfirm Cohen, Shapiro, Polisher, Sheikman andamp; Cohen, will receive$800,000 in legal and expert witness fees. Elizabeth McNasby,the lead plaintiff, is set to receive $75,000, while 12 otherplaintiffs will each receive $50,000. About 280 other womenwill be given the option of accepting $6,500 or filing aproof of claim for a larger amount.   The suit accused Crown of maintaining separate seniorityfiles for women, who accounted for 27% of the company'sproduction and maintenance work force. Women were laid off inlarger numbers than men and denied seniority, according tothe suit. Although the company abolished separate jobcategories for men and women in its collective bargainingagreement in 1967, the discriminatory practices continued,the suit contended.   Under the terms of the settlement, the company does notadmit any wrongdoing. U.S. District Judge James T. Giles inPhiladelphia has given the agreement preliminary approval andhas scheduled a final hearing Nov. 4 to hear objections.   ---   JIM BAKKER'S SENTENCE is reduced to 18 years.   A federal judge shaved 27 years off the original 45-yearprison sentence handed down against the flamboyant televisionevangelist in 1989. A $500,000 fine imposed with the originalsentence was also eliminated.   The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ordered a new sentencelast February on grounds that U.S. Judge Robert Potter, whooriginally tried the case in Charlotte, N.C., allowed hisreligious feelings to interfere when he sentenced Mr. Bakkerin October 1989. The founder of the PTL television ministrywas convicted of fleecing millions from his followers to payfor his lavish home and life style.   Mr. Bakker, 51 years old, has spent nearly two years inprison in Rochester, Minn., since his conviction. The PTLtelevision ministry founder will now be eligible for parolein 1995.   U.S. District Judge Graham Mullen, of Charlotte, cited Mr.Bakker's prison record, including work with a hospice, fundraising for United Way and leading a stop-smoking class, asreasons for reducing the original sentence.   Mr. Bakker, who made an emotional plea for a reducedsentence, showed no reaction to the ruling.   ---   LOS ANGELES BANKRUPTCY law firm will disband.
