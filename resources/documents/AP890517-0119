Committee chairman Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, said thealteration in the 600-page bill reported to the full House onTuesday _ two weeks after it was approved by the panel _ was only atechnical change to ``define the clear intent of the committee.''   Republicans, however, called it a power grab that was donewithout a vote, and promised to fight it when the legislation isreferred to the House Rules Committee and on the House floor.   ``The language in the report differs markedly from the languageas reported from the committee ...,'' said Assistant House GOP WhipRobert Walker of Pennsylvania. ``Substantive sections of the billhave been unilaterally changed by the chairman.''   The uproar is over a provision authored by Gonzalez that thebanking committee's 20 Republicans unanimously opposed two weeksago. Basically, it would require Sandamp;Ls to subsidize below-marketmortgage rates for low-income home buyers by $75 million a yearfrom 1990 to 1994 and by $150 million a year in 1995 and thereafter.   According to consumer groups, the measure could provide 100,000low-income home buyers with mortgages that are 2 percentage pointsbelow market rates.   ``If we're going to save a savings and loan system that has anyrecognizable right to that name, then you have to do somethingabout making housing affordable,'' said Gonzalez.   Republicans had opposed the measure as ``social engineering''and said it did not belong in a bill in which taxpayers are beingasked to pay more than $200 billion over the next 30 years to coverbad loans made by Sandamp;Ls in the 1980s.   The dispute was reignited last week when congressional taxexperts told the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee thatthe low-income housing provision ``looks like a tax'' _ setting offclaims that the Banking Committee had exceeded its authority.   ``It's a usurpation of this committee's jurisdiction by anothercommittee,'' charged Rep. Bill Archer of Texas, the rankingRepublican on Ways and Means.   Ways and Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., persuaded hiscommittee to defer striking the provision, which has widescalesupport among Democrats, while he and Gonzalez attempted to workout a compromise. The Ways and Means Committee is scheduled toformally adopt the change on Thursday.   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., said an accord retaining theprovision but changing its language ``in a small way'' was reachedthrough mediation by House Speaker Jim Wright's office and Rep.Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., chairman of the Ways and Means subcommitteeon select revenue measures.   As Gonzalez' measure was approved by the committee, the 12district Federal Home Loan Banks that borrow funds for and areowned by the industry would have to devote 5 percent of their ``netearnings'' or profits, or a minimum of $75 million a year until1994 for the new low-income mortgages.   For 1994 the contribution was 6 percent of net earnings or aminimum $90 million and from 1995 on it was 10 percent of netearnings or a minimum $150 million a year.</TEXT></DOC>
