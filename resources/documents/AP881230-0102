Brezhnev guilty of taking bribes andabusing his office, and sentenced him to 12 years in a labor camp.   Yuri Churbanov, who served as first deputy interior ministerduring Brezhnev's years in power, systematically took thousands ofrubles of bribes instead of enforcing Soviet laws, said the judge,army Maj. Gen. Mikhail Marov.   The verdict came a day after the Kremlin struck a further blow atthe legacy of Brezhnev, accused of fostering a period of corruptionand stagnation, by ordering that a memorial plaque be removed fromhis former home and that all factories and schools still named forhim be renamed.   Churbanov originally faced the death penalty in the sensationaltrial that began Sept. 5 on charges that he had accepted bribes ofmore than $1.1 million.   But during the trial the court threw out some charges and reducedthe amount of bribes he was accused of taking to $145,000.Prosecutors had recommended a 15-year sentence.   The 52-year-old Churbanov, who married Brezhnev's daughter Galinain 1971, stood throughout the entire 3{ hour procedure at the SovietSupreme Court, staring calmly at the judge and two lay assessors.   He did not react to the announcement of the verdict and sentence,and declined to talk to reporters afterward.   But his lawyer, Andrei Makarov, said the court's decision showedthat the Soviet Union is on the way to a society based on law.   ``You can agree or disagree with the sentence, but in substancethe throwing out of most of the charges leveled by the prosecutorsis indisputable,'' he said.   Churbanov was tried along with eight other former governmentofficials from the Central Asian republic of Uzbekistan. One of theeight was aquitted and the case of another, former UzbekistanInterior Minister Khaibar Yakhyayev, was turned back to prosecutorsfor further investigation.   Tashtimur Kakhramanov, a former deputy interior minister, who wasacquitted, took a seat in the audience after the court pronouncedhim a free man. He broke down and cried, and nurses clad in whitecame to assist him.</TEXT></DOC>
