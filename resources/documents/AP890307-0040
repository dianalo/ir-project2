Forty-two people have been killed in the three crashes, thelatest of which occurred Monday near Glasgow and claimed the livesof two passengers. Forty-four people were hurt when the two commutertrains collided.   Transport Secretary Paul Channon later acknowledged passengerfears of traveling on the British Rail network.   ``We have got to allay that concern (among the public about railsafety) and remove that concern,'' he said in Parliament.   On Saturday, five people died and 94 were injured when twopassenger trains crashed near Purley station on London's southernoutskirts.   Thirty-five were killed and more than 100 injured Dec. 12 in acrash involving three passenger trains at Clapham Junction nearLondon.   John Prescott, transport spokesman for the opposition LaborParty, on Monday called for an inquiry into safety ``to ensure thatstandards are not being compromised in order to meet financialtargets that are too tight and demanding.''   Speaking in the House of Commons, Prescott quoted a formerBritish Rail safety official, Stanley Hall, as saying safety wasbeing compromised because Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher'sConservative government was ``tight-fisted.''   Prescott said the government grant to the rail system had beencut by 35 percent in five years, a decrease of more than $3.4billion.   Channon accused Prescott of trying to score political points. Hesaid government investment in British Rail was running at``historically incredibly high levels.'' It stands at $963 millionthis year and will rise to an average of $1.29 billion a year overthe next four years, he said.   Jimmy Knapp, general secretary of the National Union ofRailwaymen, the 117,000-member train engineers' union, saidgovernment cuts have impaired safety.   The liberal London newspaper The Guardian, in an editorial todayon the three crashes, wrote: ``This is becoming an epidemic .... Noone wants money spent foolishly. But if it is a choice between asafe or a more profitable railway, there is not much doubt which waythe public would vote.''   The independent Times of London, in a headline, spoke of a``safety crisis.''   The Conservative tabloid the Daily Mail spoke of a ``growingcrisis of confidence'' among passengers.</TEXT></DOC>
