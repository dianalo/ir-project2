Alan Simpson of Wyoming accepted $90,600in honoraria last year; Republican colleague David Durenberger ofMinnesota took $62,185. Across the aisle, Democratic Sens. DavidBoren of Oklahoma and Don Riegle of Michigan each raked in morethan $52,000.   Yet the four were among 77 senators who voted Wednesday to banoutside speaking fees, lining up to partake in one of CapitolHill's favorite events _ a free vote. Indeed, 56 of the 77 votingto ban honoraria accepted such payments last year _ to the tune ofnearly $2 million.   Several of the 56 have since stopped accepting honoraria. Butfor the rest who still do, Wednesday's vote most likely will notchoke the flow of millions in speaking and appearance fees fromspecial interests.   Last year alone, senators accepted nearly $3 million inhonoraria and kept $2.1 million for personal use, giving the restto charity _ in most cases to keep within Senate limits on outsideincome.   The vote Wednesday was significant, if only symbolically,because for the first time the Senate went on record againstaccepting special interest fees. Such honoraria have figuredprominently in several recent ethics cases against lawmakers andwere banned on the House side effective this year.   But the provision, sponsored by Democratic Sen. Christopher Doddof Connecticut, was attached to a campaign finance measure that isvehemently opposed by Republicans lawmakers and the Bushadministration.   The overall measure cleared the Senate late Wednesday night, butthe House has yet to act on the issue and has major differenceswith the Senate. On top of that, President Bush is promising toveto the legislation if it carries the Senate-passed provisions.   ``This bill clearly will not become law,'' Sen. Mitch McConnellof Kentucky told his colleagues after speaking to White House Chiefof Staff John Sununu.   Thus, in the words of Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, theamendment gave senators a chance to ``vote no and take the dough''_ at least until the proposal is attached to legislation with abetter chance of becoming law.   But some publicly hailed the vote, hoping to keep the pressureon senators.   ``It is just a matter of time before the Senate joins the restof the federal government in banning private interest speaking feesfor personal use,'' said Common Cause President Fred Wertheimer.   Election Day is just three months away, and the proposal to banhonoraria was popular among senators facing voters this year _ evenmany who have handsomely supplemented their Senate salary in thepast.   Among those voting for the proposal who face re-election wereDemocratic Sens. Max Baucus of Montana, Joseph Biden of Delaware,David Boren of Oklahoma, Albert Gore of Tennessee, Howell Heflin ofAlabama, J. Bennett Johnston of Louisiana, Sam Nunn of Georgia,David Pryor of Arkansas and Paul Simon of Illinois. They accepted acombined total of $335,148 in honoraria last year.   On the Republican side, five senators up for re-election thisyear who accepted at least $20,000 in honoraria in 1989 voted infavor of the ban _ Dan Coats of Indiana, William Cohen of Maine,Larry Pressler of South Dakota, Alan Simpson of Wyoming and TedStevens of Alaska. They accepted a combined $212,900 last year.Also voting in favor of the ban was GOP Sen. Pete Wilson, theRepublican candidate for governor in California, who accepted$48,500 in 1989.   Six Republican senators up for re-election this year, apparentlyundaunted by the potential use of their vote as a campaign issue,voted against the ban. The six _ Sens. McConnell of Kentucky, MarkHatfield of Oregon, Phil Gramm of Texas, Pete Domenici of NewMexico, Thad Cochran of Mississippi and Rudy Boschwitz of Minnesota_ collected a combined $212,815 in honoraria last year.   The Dodd proposal also found favor among all six senators withcases pending before the Ethics Committee: Democrat DennisDeConcini of Arizona, Alan Cranston of California, John Glenn ofOhio and Riegle, and Republicans John McCain of Arizona and AlfonseD'Amato of New York.   Cranston, DeConcini and Glenn were among 21 senators who did notaccept honoraria in 1989. Riegle, McCain and D'Amato accepted acombined $125,000 in honoraria last year, with McCain giving all$30,250 of his to charity.</TEXT></DOC>
