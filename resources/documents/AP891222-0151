Wakefieldsaid, adding that ``the bad news'' is that the departmentdiscovered earlier this week it cannot pay the judgment from a fundit planned to use.   The historic settlement came when the government, for the firsttime, acknowledged that a nuclear weapons plant might have harmedpeople living near it.   The Fernald, Ohio, plant has spread uncounted tons of powdereduranium dust into the surrounding area. Operations were suspendedearlier this year to intensify efforts to clean up thecontamination.   Wakefield said verbal notice of the decision was given to theplaintiffs' lawyers Thursday, but he would not say specifically whythe department changed its mind about the appeal.   The government had never contested the amount of the judgment,but appealed because it disagreed with a judicial interpretation ofthe terms of the settlement.   ``We think it's really past time,'' said Lisa Crawford, one ofthe plaintiffs who contended in a 1985 lawsuit that releases ofradioactive material from the plant had damaged their propertyvalues and caused them emotional distress.   ``My question is, when are they going to put the money in thebank?'' she said.   In an interview, Wakefield said the Justice Department told himearlier this week that he could not pay the $78 million from afederal contingency fund as planned because the lawsuit was broughtnot against the government but against National Lead of Ohio Inc.,which ran the plant under federal contract until 1985.   The Energy Department was required under terms of the operatingcontract to shield National Lead against liability in the case.   Wakefield said the department would have to ask Congress for aspecial appropriation to cover the settlement and that paymentsprobably would be made in installments.   ``That's terrible,'' said Paul Nemann, one of threecourt-appointed trustees overseeing the settlement.   He said the department's lawyers had said ``in no uncertainterms'' at the time of the settlement last summer that the moneywould be available by October. The department filed a notice ofappeal Oct. 17.   Stanley Chesley, the lead lawyer for Fernald residents,applauded the Energy Department's decision to abandon its appeal.   ``That's encouraging. We'd like to work with them and get themoney,'' he said.   The settlement clears the way for federal funds to pay forlong-term medical monitoring of the health of people living withinfive miles of the Feed Materials Production Center at Fernald,which processes uranium for the weapons program.   The purpose of the medical study is to determine whether therewas an excess of cancers or other health problems that could betraced to radiation released from the plant, which has operated for38 years. It is 18 miles from Cincinnati.   The department appealed the settlement to the 6th U.S. CircuitCourt of Appeals in Cincinnati because U.S. District Judge S.Arthur Spiegel ruled in September that the deal did not prevent twocompanies near the site from suing the department for environmentaldamage to their property caused by the weapons plant.</TEXT></DOC>
