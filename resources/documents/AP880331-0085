For nine years, Officer Charles Myers worked underground,patrolling the 3{-mile network of corridors, platforms and tunnelsof Philadelphia's mass-transit system. His unit was justly dubbedthe Mole Patrol.   He now helps run the Police Department's two battery-poweredcarts, which cruise silently through the concourse at the hub ofthe city's transportation system.   The white and blue industrial carts, fitted with searchlights,rescue gear, two-way radio, roll bar and dome lights, can carry8,400 pounds and have a top speed of about 10 mph. They cost $6,200apiece.   The new carts were quickly dubbed ``mole mobiles.'' After all,``transit response vehicles'' just sounds too stuffy.   Before the carts came, if Myers heard of trouble in another partof the concourse, ``it would be a footrace,'' he said. ``You'd beexhausted by the time you got there.''   ``We see a very positive response by all the store owners,''Capt. Lawrence Norton, commander of the transit unit, saidWednesday.   ``They see this cart, they come out and want to say hello. Thepublic stops you all the time,'' he said. ``They get a real kickout of the fact that the police are down here in strength.''   Within the next year the department hopes to add five more ofthe vehicles, because a cart is cheaper than paying for extraofficers, Norton said.   The vehicles are parked and recharged during morning and eveningrush hours, when the transit system's 350,000 daily passengers clogthe passageways.   Myers said he and another officer arrested a burglar their firstnight, when they received a suspicious-person report and sped offto a far-off part of the concourse, which features stores,restaurants and banks.   ``Lo and behold, there's a man standing there inside a closedstore,'' Myers said. ``The only thing he said was, `I didn't hearyou coming.'''</TEXT></DOC>
