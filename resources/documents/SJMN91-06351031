Even ads for so-called sin products,like cigarettes and liquor, are joining in.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Business  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  GOD REST YE MERRY ADMEN, LET NOTHING HALT YOUR PUNS  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     Print ads by Grace andamp; Rothschild for Jandamp;B Scotch have white letters on abright green background that read, &quot;ingle ells, ingle ells,&quot; followed by theexplanation: &quot;The holidays aren't the same without Jandamp;B.&quot;;   For Sharp'snon-alcoholic brew, ads by Frankenberry, Laughlin andamp; Constable Inc. inMilwaukee are headlined, &quot;Noel-cohol&quot; -- with a pair of bottle caps instead ofthe umlaut over the &quot;o.&quot;;   For Eastman Kodak Co., ads by Young andamp; Rubicam NewYork show a Scrooge-type character, next to the word &quot;Humbug,&quot; transformed bya Kodak Star 35 camera into a &quot;Shutterbug.&quot;;   Advertising executives say thewordplay is intended to tap into the spirit of the season, to add joy andcheer to pitches for products like Joy and Cheer.;   &quot;It's a lighter, joyoustime of year,&quot; said Roy Grace, chairman of Grace andamp; Rothschild in New York.&quot;That translates into 'Let's have a little fun, let's do a pun.' &quot;;   Andthere are many other examples of these playful ads:;   (check) For theNational Pork Producers Council, which for years has been selling pork as &quot;theother white meat,&quot; ads by Bozell Inc. in Chicago carry the theme &quot;WhiteChristmas.&quot;;   (check) For Baileys Original Irish Cream liqueur, ads by Geer,DuBois Inc. in New York urge consumers to &quot;Let it flow, let it flow, let itflow.&quot;;   (check) For Kix cereal, which contrasts its plain appearance toother brands' colorful gimmickry, ads by Saatchi andamp; Saatchi Advertising depict38 Kix puffs arranged in the shape of a Christmas tree. The headline reads,&quot;No decorations necessary.&quot;;   (check) For Virginia Slims cigarettes, printads by Leo Burnett U.S.A. in Chicago are captioned, &quot;You've come afa-la-la-la-la-long way, baby.&quot;;   While such ads have always been popular atthe holidays, executives say there are more than ever this year. The reason,they add, is a belief that humor might, in some small way, help banish theanxieties over the economy that are keeping consumers from becomingcustomers.;   One pitfall to this form of advertising is the subjective natureof the humor: One person's grin is another's groan.;   But that has not proveda problem for Sharp's, said Tom Cardella, a category manager at the MillerBrewing Co. in Milwaukee, adding that consumers and retailers have respondedthat the humor &quot;fits in well&quot; with the product's seasonal appeal.;   Anotherpotential drawback is the possibility that treating the holiday season in alight-hearted fashion, especially when it comes to the religious aspects ofChristmas, might prove offensive.;   &quot;There's always the question of theChristmas holiday being exploited for commercial purposes,&quot; said F. ForresterChurch, minister of All Souls Unitarian Church in New York, &quot;and that does cutradically against the grain of the Gospel.&quot;;   &quot;On the other hand,&quot; he added,&quot;anyone who gets too excited about this is also missing the point of theChristmas season.&quot; He cited what he called &quot;my favorite quote in theology,&quot;from the writer G.K. Chesterton: &quot;Angels can fly because they take themselveslightly.&quot;;   &quot;And I've added, 'The devil falls on account of his gravity.' &quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  New York Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Street  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911216  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  December  </MONTH><PG.COL>  5D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  572  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday, December 16, 199100351031,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
