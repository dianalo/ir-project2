Since the war began in 1975, the antagonists have been given tobelligerent talk. It will not be easy for them to tone down theirrhetoric if they feel that national honor is at stake.   South Africa has justified its support of the Angolan rebelmovement UNITA as necessary to thwart a communist onslaught insouthern Africa. Angola's Marxist government, backed by 40,000Cuban troops and about 1,000 Soviet advisers, has derided UNITA asa puppet of South Africa's ``racist regime.''   The two-day talks in London placed Cuba, Angola and South Africaat the same bargaining table for the first time. A joint communiqueissued Wednesday said they would meet again soon.   U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Chester Crocker, who served aschairman, said the session was an important step toward withdrawalof Cuban and South African troops from Angola and independence forSouth-West Africa, the South African-controlled territory known asNamibia.   ``But it is fair to be skeptical,'' Crocker said. ``There arebig, tough issues that lie ahead.''   Among those issues:   _UNITA, which was excluded from the London talks, insists thatit must be included eventually. The rebels' leader, Jonas Savimbi,is reviled by Angolan government officials, but he is a proud,self-confident commander who is unlikely to stand aside in theinterests of a settlement. The United States, which helps arm therebels, says it won't abandon him.   _Angola will not want to be seen by other Third World countriesas yielding to the white-minority rulers of South Africa. Merewithdrawal of South African troops from its territory is unlikelyto suffice, and Angola will probably insist on unconditionalindependence for Namibia.   _South African negotiators will likely balk at any steps thatcould be depicted by extreme-right whites as capitulation toSoviet-bloc pressure. There is skepticism about South Africa'spublic commitment to allowing U.N.-supervised independenceelections in Namibia once Cuban troops leave Angola. Such electionswould likely be won by the South-West African People'sOrganization, the leftist guerrilla movement that has been fightingSouth African rule for 22 years. South Africa may pursue somearrangement that would lessen SWAPO's chances of taking power.   Even as the talks concluded, the hostile rhetoric continued.   An Angolan general claimed his troops had forced a retreat byUNITA and South African units in southern Angola. Such boasts, trueor false, are unlikely to induce concessions from South Africanleaders who view conservative whites as their main constituency.   In South Africa, the state-run broadcasting company issued acommentary describing Cuba's troop deployment as the centralproblem.   ``As in the case of the Soviet troops in Afghanistan, the Cubansin Angola have been the cause of the destruction of that country,the destabilization of the region and a growing threat to thestrategic interests of the Western world,'' the South AfricanBroadcasting Corp. said.   South Africa's foreign minister, Roelof ``Pik'' Botha, suggestedthat his country might try to play upon the U.S. government'sapparent eagerness to broker a settlement.   Botha said U.S. congressmen should understand that furthersanctions against South Africa would jeopardize the peacenegotiations.   Balancing the potential obstacles to peace are several factorsconducive to a settlement. Perhaps foremost is the increasing costof the war, which has become the most intense conventional warfarein Africa since World War II.   The Soviet Union, which supplies the Cuban-Angolan forces,appears interested in a non-military settlement. Angola knows itsbattered economy cannot be rehabilitated without peace, and itreportedly has held secret talks with UNITA recently. South Africawould like to avoid raising the death toll of its white conscripts.   The London talks focused on an Angolan proposal for Cuban troopsto stage a phased withdrawal while South Africa pulled its forcesout of Angola and Namibia.   Cuba has suggested a four-year timetable and wants UNITA to bebarred from military operations. South Africa has said the Cubanwithdrawal must be completed before it would begin moves towardNamibian independence.   The Cubans came to Angola in 1975, helping the Marxist movementwhich now runs the government to win a power struggle with UNITAfollowing independence from Portugal.   The United States has been trying for eight years to get theCubans out of Angola. But Crocker said pressure for a settlementwas on the warring parties, not the United States, because ``it is,after all, their boys who are dying.''</TEXT><TEXT>   EDITOR'S NOTE: David Crary, news editor of the AP's Johannesburgbureau, has been reporting from eastern and southern Africa since1985.</TEXT></DOC>
