Telephone (202) 523-8151.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>The revised Occupational Exposure to Formaldehyde standard, which was promulgatedon December 4, 1987, lowers the permissible exposure limit for formaldehydeto 1 part per million (ppm), measured as an 8-hour time-weighted average(TWA), with a short term exposure limit (STEL) of 2 ppm measured over a15-minute period. The standard also contains provisions for employee exposuremonitoring, medical surveillance, recordkeeping, regulated areas, emergencyprocedures, preferred methods of compliance, maintenance and selectionof personal protective equipment, and hazard communication. This noticeamends the standard to correct errors or inconsistencies found in the provisionsfor respirator selection and recordkeeping and to correct some typographicalerrors found in the text of the standard.<ITAG tagnum="84">Corrections and Technical Amendments</ITAG>1. <T3>Paragraph (g), Respiratory protection:</T3> A few typographical errorsand omissions in Table 1_Minimum Requirements for Respiratory ProtectionAgainst Formaldehyde (52 FR at 46293) require a technical amendment ofthe final rule.The Table 1 entry for Type C respirators must be modified. The preambleto the final rule indicates that employers must select respirators fromthose certified as acceptable for protection against formaldehyde by theNational Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) (see 52 FRat 46266). As the NIOSH Certified Equipment List clearly indicates, TypeC supplied air respirators approved for use in formaldehyde atmospheresmust be operated in a positive pressure mode. OSHA inadvertently droppedthe word ``pressure'' from the phrase ``demand type'' in describing TypeC respirators in Table 1 in the final rule, thus appearing to approve theuse of a negative pressure respirator operated in the demand mode. OSHAalso failed to indicate that Type C supplied air respirators operated inthe continuous flow mode are approved for use in formaldehyde atmospheres.The correct entry in Table 1 should read as follows: Type C supplied airrespirator, pressure demand or continuous flow type, with full facepiece,hood, or helmet.Paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of the final rule (52 FR at 46293) requires employersto make powered air purifying respirators meeting the specifications ofTable 1 available to any employee who experiences difficulty wearing anegative pressure respirator to reduce exposure to formaldehyde. Table1, however, does not list any powered air purifying respirators. To avoidconfusion on this issue, OSHA is deleting the words ``meeting the specificationsin Table 1'' from paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of the standard and substitutinga requirement that any powered air purifying respirator used must provideadequate protection. This clarification is intended to remind employerssubstituting powered air purifying respirators for negative pressure respiratorsthat they must consider whether the protection factor that the poweredair purifying respirator supplies is adequate to protect a worker underthe conditions of the exposure.It was brought to OSHA's attention that the final rule for formaldehydeinadvertently omitted reference to chin style gas masks approved by NIOSHfor use in formaldehyde atmospheres. Since this respirator will adequatelyprotect workers exposed to formaldehyde, it should also be available forconsideration in selecting a comfortable and adequately fitting respirator.Consequently, OSHA is amending Table 1 in the final rule to permit useof chin style respirators for protection against formaldehyde in atmospheresup to 100 ppm and for emergency escape.The above described amendments are minor and not controversial. There isno need to subject these technical amendments to rulemaking or other publicprocedures (see 29 CFR 1911.5) and good cause is hereby found to dispensewith such procedures in this instance.2. <T3>Paragraph (o), Recordkeeping</T3>. In the preamble to the final ruleOSHA indicated its intent to add a specific reference to 29 CFR 1910.20,the access to medical records standard, to the paragraph allowing employeeaccess to medical records (see 52 FR at 46289). This was inadvertentlyomitted, and OSHA is correcting the standard to include this language inparagraph (o)(6)(iii).3. This document also corrects several typographical errors in the finalrule on Occupational Exposure to Formaldehyde that appeared in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on December 4, 1987 [52 FR 46168] which has nowbeen published in the Code of Federal Regulations as 29 CFR 1910.1048.<ITAG tagnum="84">Authority and Signature </ITAG>This document was prepared under the direction of Alan C.
