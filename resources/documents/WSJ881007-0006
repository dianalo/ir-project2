Then, as now, Drexel was on retainer by Pillsbury as part of the Minneapolis food and restaurant company's anti-takeover team. That team currently is seeking a strategy to repel Grand Metropolitan PLC's $5.23 billion surprise tender offer announced earlier this week.    Donald N. Smith, a former Burger King president who today operates several other restaurant chains, said that Investment Limited Partnership of Greenwich, Conn., and Fort Worth, Texas, proposed that Pillsbury spin off the 5,680-unit fast-food operation as a private company, which he would then manage. His investment backers would have held a majority ownership in the business, Mr. Smith said.    Investment Limited Partnership is headed by Dort A. Cameron III, who once worked at Drexel. In an interview yesterday, Mr. Cameron said of a possible Burger King acquisition: &quot;I don't think that interest has gone away.&quot; Asked whether his partnership would bankroll Mr. Smith in any future bid, Mr. Cameron replied, &quot;Clearly, our business is supporting capable, energized, smart businessmen, especially ones we're in business with already.&quot;    The partnership is part-owner of Tennessee Restaurant Co.; Holiday Corp. and Mr. Smith also are part-owners. Tennessee Restaurant recently paid $375 million to acquire the Friendly's restaurant chain from Hershey Foods Corp. Tennessee also owns and operates the Perkins Family Restaurants chain. Mr. Smith is Tennessee's chairman and chief executive officer.    Besides Drexel, the partnership investors include the Bass brothers of Fort Worth and Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S.    Drexel vigorously disputes that a formal offer was made for Burger King, and says it was &quot;a passive investor&quot; in Investment Limited. Nevertheless, Pillsbury apparently saw a possible conflict of interest in the investment banking firm's involvement, and questioned it at the time.    Mr. Smith said that a representative from the partnership's Fort Worth office, Peter Joost, met with an executive vice president of Pillsbury last April and suggested a spinoff of Burger King. Initially, Mr. Smith said, the group had considered offering $1.2 billion in cash and the assumption of $400 million in Burger King debt, but realized that would create a huge tax liability for Pillsbury. Details of such a spin-off transaction weren't available, and those involved in the discussions wouldn't elaborate.    &quot;We concluded it was worth $1.6 billion,&quot; Mr. Smith said. Analysts have calculated Burger King's value considerably lower than that.    But Pillsbury immediately rejected the proposal -- for months it has said Burger King isn't for sale -- and apparently concluded the spin-off suggestion didn't require consideration by its board.    Despite the initial rejection and Grand Met's bid for Pillsbury, Mr. Smith says he remains interested in acquiring Burger King, which he pursued at the suggestion of discontented Burger King franchisees. &quot;It's not over the hill,&quot; Mr. Smith said of the troubled fast-food chain. &quot;It has to be repositioned and directionally focused, but there's a fantastic group of franchisees highly dedicated to the concept.&quot;    Whether Pillsbury would ever be interested in selling to him is another matter. According to people who knew Mr. Smith while he was at Burger King, he did not get along well with some Pillsbury executives, particularly then-chairman and chief executive William H. Spoor.    Mr. Smith is well regarded in the restaurant industry. In addition to his stint at Burger King in the late 1970s, he was a senior executive at McDonald's Corp. and supervised PepsiCo Inc.'s Pizza Hut and Taco Bell fast-food operations.    Early this year, Mr. Smith met with numerous Burger King franchisees to explore how they might assume control of the chain, which many thought Pillsbury was short-changing. &quot;We said we'd be with him if it wasn't a traumatic thing on the system,&quot; said William Pothitos, president of the North American Burger King franchisee council.    After winning pledges of support, Mr. Smith contacted Mr. Joost, who works for Richard Rainwater, a former financial adviser to the Basses who now runs Investment Limited Partnership's Fort Worth office, to explore ways to acquire Burger King.    Meanwhile, Pillsbury got wind of Mr. Smith's meetings with franchisees. &quot;He was telling them he wanted to make an offer to Pillsbury to buy Burger King and that Drexel was financing the offer,&quot; said Jerry W. Levin, executive vice president and head of mergers and acquisitions at Pillsbury.    &quot;Drexel at that time was a signed-on and paid member of Pillsbury's defense team, and I thought that was a little odd,&quot; Mr. Levin said this week. &quot;So I called Drexel and said, 'What in the heck is going on?' And they said, 'We don't know. We'll find out.'&quot;    That led to a phone conversation between Messrs. Levin and Joost. &quot;We said we were really upset that they were interfering with our franchisees. They were saying nasty things about us and we wanted them to cease and desist,&quot; Mr. Levin said. &quot;I think Drexel informed them they had no interest in financing this,&quot; he added.    But Mr. Joost prevailed on Mr. Levin to hear him out, so the two met in Minneapolis, and Mr. Joost proposed the Burger King spinoff.    Exactly what was said is unclear. Mr. Joost couldn't be reached for comment and Mr. Levin said &quot;he never made an offer.&quot; But Mr. Smith and others familiar with events dispute that, although Mr. Smith said &quot;they never got into a dollars-and-cents discussion.&quot;    Jeffrey P. Beck, a Drexel partner, said, &quot;Mr. Rainwater and Mr. Smith, in my opinion, were on a fishing expedition at best. If anything, Drexel is at most a passive investor that makes absolutely no investment decisions&quot; in the partnership. &quot;Somebody's creating this fiction, not us,&quot; he said.    Shortly after Pillsbury senior management rejected the proposal, Mr. Spoor, who had retired but then returned as acting chairman, flew to Miami and met twice with groups of Burger King franchisees to calm what Mr. Levin described as &quot;turmoil&quot; in their ranks.    Attendees say Mr. Spoor alluded to the bid by Mr. Smith, but said Pillsbury was committed to retaining the chain. &quot;Spoor would never have sold off Burger King -- especially to Don Smith,&quot; said Mr. Pothitos, the franchisee council president. &quot;But (the offer) forced Bill Spoor to put his full attention on the Burger King problem. That's really what we wanted. We got their attention.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
