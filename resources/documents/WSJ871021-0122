Hercules, a chemicals and aerospace concern, said it expects the contract initially will generate $500 million in revenue and could increase if more contracts are awarded later.    The rocket motors are expected to be ready for launch by late 1990.    The award boosts Hercules's presence in the aerospace industry. The company said it expects to invest $100 million in the project, using cash from the $1 billion after taxes received last month from the sale of its share in Himont Inc. Hercules's aerospace backlog now stands at more than $10 billion, the company said.    In 1986, sales at Hercules's aerospace unit reached $906 million. Sales for the entire company totaled $2.6 billion.    The Titan award also marks the second time that the chemical and aerospace concern has been chosen over Morton Thiokol Inc. for a major contract. Earlier this year, Hercules won a contract to make boosters for the military's fleet of unmanned military rockets.    In Chicago, a spokesman for Morton Thiokol said the company is disappointed about not winning the contract. &quot;We believe our proposal offered a reliable booster at a very competitive price,&quot; he said. He declined to comment further, saying the company hasn't yet received a complete briefing about how the selection was made.    Hercules is also lobbying the National Aeronautics and Space Administration for a second supplier for the solid boosters on the space shuttle. Currently, Morton Thiokol is the sole supplier of the space shuttle boosters.    Martin Marietta, based in Bethesda, Md., is the primary contractor for the Titan project.    Regarding the Titan contract, Robert Reitzes, an analyst for Mabon, Nugent andamp; Co., said, &quot;This is really good for Hercules. It will be a solid source for earnings and is the best aerospace program to be in.&quot; He estimated the contract will contribute $20 million to $25 million to Hercules net income in 1989. In 1986, Hercules had net income of $227 million, or $4.02 a share, including a gain of $29.1 million from the sale of businesses. </TEXT></DOC>
