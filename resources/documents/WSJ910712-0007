Environmental issues arecomplex, and are difficult to describe to a lay audience evenwhen someone is trying. Your article addresses the symbol andignores the complexity.   The subtropical woodlands of south Texas are one of themost biologically diverse habitats in the U.S., with nearly400 species of birds -- many of them unique to this area --thousands of plants and dozens of mammals, plus countlessinsects, frogs, lizards and other species that are thefoundation of this unique ecosystem.</LP><TEXT>   The Brownsville Chamber of Commerce found that wildlife isthe second-biggest tourist draw, and in this pooragricultural region, a diversification of the economy is muchneeded. Also, the conservation effort has secondary benefitsnot explored in your article. For example, the Rio Grande isone of the most polluted rivers in the country; much of thepollution is caused by runoff from cleared lands. The effortto protect and restore natural vegetation on the riverbankswill do much to improve the region's water quality.   The Nature Conservancy has been helping for a number ofyears in the acquisition of land for the National WildlifeRefuge and establishing private refuges that complement thepublic effort. Our experience does not agree with the priceyou quote of $1,600 an acre; a range of $200 to $1,200 anacre is much more typical.
