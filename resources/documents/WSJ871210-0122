But at a White House meeting, Republican senators extracted from President Reagan an agreement that he will continue to put pressure -- including a threat to veto the entire measure -- on lawmakers to change other elements of the package that he opposes.    The legislation, the first of two bills that comprise a deficit-reduction package, would contain about $22.6 billion in savings from projected levels in the fiscal year that began Oct. 1. A $9 billion tax increase is part of that package.    Debate on the measure is scheduled to start today, and senators are expected to complete the package this week.    White House officials appear to have contented themselves with allowing the bill to move forward and will fight many of their battles in a later House-Senate conference where the final details would be worked out. Disagreements remain over asset sales, farm subsidies and the so-called fairness doctrine for broadcasters.    &quot;There are some things left in this bill that the president doesn't want,&quot; said Sen. Pete Domenici (R., N.M.), who met with Mr. Reagan yesterday. But he added, &quot;We're going to have to get something started. I said (to the president) we can only fix it in conference if you're willing to veto.&quot;    Yesterday, Reagan administration officials and Senate leaders agreed to compromise on a proposal that would allow Rural Electrification Administration cooperatives to pre-pay $5 billion in high-interest federal loans. The administration opposes the provision because it would lose revenue in the long run because of foregone interest payments, but would still give the new loans federal backing.    The compromise would add $2.5 billion in other federal loans chosen by the administration, anticipating that the amount of prepaid rural-electrification loans would be reduced to $2.5 billion in the final bill.    The negotiators also agreed to alter an oil-seeds subsidy provision that might have lost money in two years rather than raise money as lawmakers had hoped. The provision would have allowed farmers to plant idled corn acreage with oil seeds, such as soybeans. The compromise would compel farmers to keep their land idle and out of either corn or oil seeds if the price of soybeans fell low enough to require government subsidy payments.    The administration aides failed to strike from the package a provision that would make the fairness doctrine for broadcasters a law. The doctrine requires broadcasters that air controversial material to provide free air time to opposing viewpoints.    The aides also didn't remove fees in the measure that would penalize broadcasters who sell television and radio stations within three years of buying them. That may be fought out during the coming floor debate. </TEXT></DOC>
