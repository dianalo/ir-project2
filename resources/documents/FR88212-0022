Background </ITAG>On October 3, 1980 (45 FR 65956), EPA published Method 25, ``Determinationof Total Gaseous Nonmethane Organic Emissions as Carbon.'' Shortly afterpublication, testers began to report erratic results with the method andsuggested a number of different causes for the imprecision. As a result,EPA began a program to review the test method in March 1982. The EPA completedthe review and proposed revisions to Method 25, which will make the methodsimpler, more reliable, and more precise. The results of the various studies on Method 25 are summarized in the followingreports, which are included in the docket:1. Evaluation of Trap Recovery Design, EMB Project Number 82SFS-1. 2. Preparation of Method 25 Sampling Equipment and Determination of Limitof Detection and Limit of Quantitation, EMB Project Number 82SFS-1. 3. Evaluation of Method 25 Condensate Trap Packing Material, EMB ProjectNumber 82SFS-1. 4. Oxidation Catalyst Screening and Evaluation Study, ESED Project Number82SFSI-4-2. 5. Quality Control Procedures Evaluation, ESED Project Number 82SFS1-4-3.6. Condensate Trap Development and Evaluation, ESED Project Number 82SFS1-4-4.7. Trap Recovery Procedures Evaluation, ESED Project Number 82SFS1-4-5.8. Evaluation of Particulate Filters, ESED Project Number 82SFS1-5-2. The studies showed that the basic operating principle of Method 25 wassound, but some changes in equipment design and operating practices wouldimprove the reliability of the method. These changes can best be discussedby dividing the method into three parts: Sampling, sample recovery, andanalysis. The major changes in the sampling equipment are the addition of a heatedfilter, a redesigned condensate trap, and a different packing materialfor the condensate trap. The purpose of the filter is to remove organicparticulate matter from the sample and, thus, eliminate a potential sourceof imprecision. The filter is heated to a temperature of 120 anddegrees;C(248 anddegrees;F). The new trap design is a simple U-tube which may be moreeasily and cheaply produced than the current design. It also provides afaster and more complete sample recovery than the existing trap while showingequal collection efficiency. The new packing material is quartz wool, whichshows better durability and collection efficiency than the currently specifiedstainless steel packing. The major changes in the sample recovery system are a new oxidation catalyst,a simplified recovery system, and lower operating temperatures. The newoxidation catalyst has proven to be very durable and to provide 100 percentoxidation efficiency for a wide variety of organic compounds at much loweroperating temperatures than the current catalyst. The redesigned recoverysystem has eliminated some of the tubing and valving and, thus, reducedthe potential for sample loss during recovery and decreased recovery times.The lower temperatures for sample recovery will increase the life expectancyof the recovery system materials and simplify the operation of the system.The major change in the sample analysis system is a new separation columnfor the nonmethane organics analyzer. This new column provides separationof carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and methane from a wider range of organiccompounds than the currently specified column. In addition to these major changes, there are a number of minor changes,particularly in the area of quality assurance (QA) and calibration. This rulemaking does not impose emission measurement requirements beyondthose specified in the current regulations, nor does it change any emissionstandard. Rather, the rulemaking simply revises test procedures associatedwith emission measurement requirements that would apply irrespective ofthis rulemaking. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Public Participation </ITAG>The amendments and test methods were proposed in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on November 7, 1986 (51 FR 40448). To provideinterested persons the opportunity for oral presentation of data, views,or arguments concerning the proposed rules, a public hearing was scheduledfor December 22, 1986, at the Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, butno one wished to make an oral presentation. The public comment period wasfrom November 7, 1986, to January 21, 1987. Three comment letters werereceived concerning issues relevant to the revised test method. The commentshave been carefully considered and, were determined to be appropriate bythe Administrator, changes have been made in the proposed test method.<ITAG tagnum="85">III. Significant Comments and Changes to the Proposed Test Method</ITAG>Three comment letters were received on the proposed test method. A detai1eddiscussion of these comments and responses can be found in the backgroundinformation document which is referred to in the <T2>ADDRESSES</T2> section of this preamble. The summary of comments andresponses serves as the basis for the revisions which have been made tothe test method between proposal and promulgation. The major comments andresponses are summarized in this preamble. Two of the comment letters containedmultiple comments. One commenter thought that the addition of a heated filter and the associatedfilter heating equipment should be optional rather than mandatory becausemany sources have no particulate matter in the stack gas. Another commenterthought that filtration is necessary but that the proposed filtration systemis unnecessarily complex. This commenter suggested using an in-stack filterin place of the proposed out-of-stack filter. We believe that the method will yield acceptable precision only when thesample is filtered even at sources that are thought to be free of particulatematter. The method is extremely sensitive to contamination, and the bestway to prevent contaminant carbon from being included in the sample isto filter it. However, we think an in-stack filter is appropriate onlyat those sources where a heated out-of-stack filter would be prohibitedfor safety reasons. Because organic compounds can change physical statewith changing temperature, the filtration temperature determines whethersome organic compounds are counted as volatile organic compounds (VOC)or not. Under these circumstances, we believe that the only equitable mannerin which to measure VOC emissions is to filter all samples at the samefiltration temperature regardless of the source's operating temperature.A third commenter thought that the 250 anddegrees;F filtration temperaturewas too high and should be reduced to 190 anddegrees;F. This commenter claimedthat the filtration temperature was chosen to correspond to that of EPAMethod 5 and concluded that it had nothing to do with the photochemicalreactivity of volatile organic materials. The commenter argued that thetemperature should be reduced to one that was consistent with removal ofcondensible organic material or particulate matter that does not reactphotochemically to form ozone. The commenter suggested that the filtertemperature be reduced to 190 anddegrees;F because this would reduce theamount of condensible organic material collected in the sample.We do not agree that all photochemically reactive organic compounds mustbe gases at ambient temperatures. Even those compounds that are normallyliquids at ambient temperature may have a significant vapor pressure, andthus exist partly in the gas phase as evidenced by the evaporation of organicliquids stored in open containers. If the filtration temperature were reducedfrom 250 anddegrees;F to 190 anddegrees;F, we believe that compounds whichare properly considered VOC would be artificially excluded from the sample.One commenter thought that the proposed sampling procedure ignored theneed for isokinetic sampling when particulate matter is present. This commenterargued that when condensed organic material is present, it will be disproportionatelysampled by the method. We believe that isokinetic sampling is not necessary because particlesformed by condensation are typically submicron in size and will behavelike a gas. Thus, even if the sample is not collected isokinetically, itwill not contain a disproportionate amount of condensed organic matter.One commenter wrote that the method does not address the problem of residualcontamination in the sampling train. The commenter suggested that a pretestconditioning and quality assurance check be added to the method. We agree with this comment and have incorporated a contamination checkin the method. Another commenter thought that the leak check in the method could be reducedfrom 10 minutes to 5 minutes. We agree that the leak-check procedure can be reduced from 10 minutes to5 minutes and have revised the method to reflect this. This commenter also wrote that a mercury manometer is not appropriate forfield use and that vacuum gauges should be substituted. We agree that a vacuum gauge of sufficient accuracy could be used in placeof a mercury manometer and have revised the method to reflect this. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Administrative </ITAG>The docket is an organized and complete file of all the information consideredby EPA in the development of this rulemaking. The docket is a dynamic file,since material is added throughout the rulemaking development. The docketingsystem is intended to allow members of the public and industries involvedto identify readily and locate documents so that they can intelligentlyand effectively participate in the rulemaking process. Along with the statementof basis and purpose of the proposed and promulgated test methods and EPAresponses to significant comments, the contents of the docket will serveas the record in case of judicial review (Section 307(d)(7)(a)). Miscellaneous The rulemaking does not impose any additional emission measurement requirementson facilities affected by this rulemaking. Rather, this rulemaking revisesthe test method to which the affected facilities are already subject. Under Executive Order 12291, EPA must judge whether a regulation is ``major''and, therefore, subject to the requirement of a regulatory impact analysis.This regulation is not major because it will not have an annual effecton the economy of $100 million or more; it will not result in a major increasein costs or prices; and there will be no significant adverse effects oncompetition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on theability of U.S.-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprisesin domestic or export markets. This regulation was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)for review as required by Executive Order 12291. This rule does not contain any information collection requirements subjectto OMB review under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501<T3>et seq. </T3>Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that theattached rule will not have any economic impact on small entities becauseno additional test costs are incurred. Any written comments from OMB andany written EPA responses are available in the docket. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 60 </ITAG>Air pollution control, Intergovernmental relations, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements, Incorporation by reference, Automobile surface coating, Largeappliance surface coating, Beverage can coating, and Metal coil coating.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: February 3, 1988. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">A.

Method 25 of Appendix A is revised to read as follows: <ITAG tagnum="84">Appendix A_Reference Methods </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * * </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="75">Method 25_Determination of Total Gaseous Nonmethane Organic Emissionsas Carbon </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">1. Applicability and Principle </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1.1 Applicability. This method applies to the measurement of volatileorganic compounds (VOC) as total gaseous nonmethane organics (TGNMO) ascarbon in source emissions. Organic particulate matter will interfere withthe analysis and, therefore, a particulate filter is required. The minimumdetectable for the method is 50 ppm as carbon. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">When carbon dioxide (CO<T2>2</T2>) and water vapor are present together in the stack, they canproduce a positive bias in the sample. The magnitude of the bias dependson the concentrations of CO<T2>2</T2> and water vapor. As a guideline, multiply the CO<T2>2</T2> concentration, expressed as volume percent, times the watervapor concentration. If this product does not exceed 100, the bias canbe considered insignificant. For example, the bias is not significant fora source having 10 percent CO<T2>2</T2> and 10 percent water vapor, but it would be significant fora source near the detection limit having 10 percent CO<T2>2</T2> and 20 percent water vapor. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This method is not the only method that applies to the measurementof TGNMO. Costs, logistics, and other practicalities of source testingmay make other test methods more desirable for measuring VOC contents ofcertain effluent streams. Proper judgment is required in determining themost applicable VOC test method. For example, depending upon the molecularweight of the organics in the effluent stream, a totally automated semicontinuousnonmethane organics (NMO) analyzer interfaced directly to the source mayyield accurate results. This approach has the advantage of providing emissiondata semicontinuously over an extended time period. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Direct measurement of an effluent with a flame ionization detector(FID) analyzer may be appropriate with prior characterization of the gasstream and knowledge that the detector responds predictably to the organiccompounds in the stream. If present, methane (CH<T2>4</T2>) will, of course, also be measured. The FID can be applied tothe determination of the mass concentration of the total molecular structureof the organic emissions under any of the following limited conditions:(1) Where only one compound is known to exist; (2) when the organic compoundsconsist of only hydrogen and carbon; (3) where the relative percentagesof the compounds are known or can be determined, and the FID responsesto the compounds are known; (4) where a consistent mixture of the compoundsexists before and after emission control and <T3>only </T3>the relative concentrations are to be assessed; or (5) wherethe FID can be calibrated against mass standards of the compounds emitted(solvent emissions, for example). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Another example of the use of a direct FID is as a screening method.If there is enough information available to provide a rough estimate ofthe analyzer accuracy, the FID analyzer can be used to determine the VOCcontent of an uncharacterized gas stream. With a sufficient buffer to accountfor possible inaccuracies, the direct FID can be a useful tool to obtainthe desired results without costly exact determination. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In situations where a qualitative/quantitative analysis of an effluentstream is desired or required, a gas chromatographic FID system may apply.However, for sources emitting numerous organics, the time and expense ofthis approach will be formidable. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1.2 Principle. An emission sample is withdrawn from the stack at aconstant rate through a heated filter and a chilled condensate trap bymeans of an evacuated sample tank. After sampling is completed, the TGNMOare determined by independently analyzing the condensate trap and sampletank fractions and combining the analytical results. The organic contentof the condensate trap fraction is determined by oxidizing the NMO to CO<T2>2</T2> and quantitatively collecting the effluent in an evacuated vessel;then a portion of the CO<T2>2</T2> is reduced to CH<T2>4</T2> and measured by an FID. The organic content of the sample tankfraction is measured by injecting a portion of the sample into a gas chromatographiccolumn to separate the NMO from carbon monoxide (CO), CO<T2>2</T2>, and CH<T2>4</T2>; the NMO are oxidized to CO<T2>2</T2>, reduced to CH<T2>4</T2>, and measured by an FID. In this manner, the variable responseof the FID associated with different types of organics is eliminated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">2. Apparatus </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2.1 Sampling.

Procedure </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4.1  Sampling.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4.1.1 Cleaning Sampling Equipment. Before its initial use and aftereach subsequent use, a condensate trap should be thoroughly cleaned andchecked to ensure that it is not contaminated. Both cleaning and checkingcan be accomplished by installing the trap in the condensate recovery systemand treating it as if it were a sample. The trap should be heated as describedin the final paragraph of Section 4.3.3. A trap may be considered cleanwhen the CO<T2>2</T2> concentration in its effluent gas drops below 10 ppm. This checkis optional for traps that have been used to collect samples which werethen recovered according to the procedure in Section 4.3.3. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4.1.2 Sample Tank Evacuation and Leak Check. Evacuate the sample tankto 10 mm Hg absolute pressure or less. Then close the sample tank valve,and allow the tank to sit for 60 minutes. The tank is acceptable if nochange in tank vacuum is noted. The evacuation and leak check may be conductedeither in the laboratory or the field. The results of the leak check shouldbe included in the test report. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4.1.3 Sample Train Assembly. Just before assembly, measure the tankvacuum using a mercury U-tube manometer or absolute pressure gauge. Recordthis vacuum, the ambient temperature, and the barometric pressure at thistime. Close the sample tank valve and assemble the sampling system as shownin Figure 25-1. Immerse the condensate trap body in dry ice. The pointwhere the inlet tube joins the trap body should be 2.5 to 5 cm above thetop of the dry ice. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4.1.4 Pretest Leak Check. A pretest leak check is required. Calculateor measure the approximate volume of the sampling train from the probetrip to the sample tank valve. After assembling the sampling train, plugthe probe tip, and make certain that the sample tank valve is closed. Turnon the vacuum pump, and evacuate the sampling system from the probe tipto the sample tank valve to an absolute pressure of 10 ppm Hg or less.Close the purge valve, turn off the pump, wait a minimum period of 5 minutes,and recheck the indicated vacuum. Calculate the maximum allowable pressurechange based on a leak rate of 1 percent of the sampling rate using Equation25-1, Section 6.2. If the measured pressure change exceeds the calculatedlimit, correct the problem before beginning sampling. The results of theleak check should be included in the test report. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4.1.5 Sample Train Operation. Unplug the probe tip, and place theprobe into the stack such that the probe is perpendicular to the duct orstack axis; locate the probe tip at a single preselected point of averagevelocity facing away from the direction of gas flow. For stacks havinga negative static pressure, seal the sample port sufficiently to preventair in-leakage around the probe. Set the probe temperature controller to129 anddegrees;C (265 anddegrees;F) and the filter temperature controller to121 anddegrees;C (250 anddegrees;F). Allow the probe and filter to heat forabout 30 minutes before purging the sample train. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Close the sample valve, open the purge valve, and start the vacuumpump. Set the flow rate between 60 and 100 cc/min, and purge the trainwith stack gas for at least 10 minutes. When the temperatures at the exitends of the probe and filter are within their specified range, samplingmay begin. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Check the dry ice level around the condensate trap, and add dry iceif necessary. Record the clock time. To begin sampling, close the purgevalve and stop the pump. Open the sample valve and the sample tank valve.Using the flow control valve, set the flow through the sample train tothe proper rate. Adjust the flow rate as necessary to maintain a constantrate (andplusmin;10 percent) throughout the duration of the sampling period.Record the sample tank vacuum and flowmeter setting at 5-minute intervals.(See Figure 25-8.) Select a total sample time greater than or equal tothe minimum sampling time specified in the applicable subpart of the regulation;end the sampling when this time period is reached or when a constant flowrate can no longer be maintained because of reduced sample tank vacuum.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note._</T4>If sampling had to be stopped before obtaining the minimumsampling time (specified in the applicable subpart) because a constantflow rate could not be maintained, proceed as follows: After closing thesample tank valve, remove the used sample tank from the sampling train(without disconnecting other portions of the sampling train). Take anotherevacuated and leak-checked sample tank, measure and record the tank vacuum,and attach the new tank to the sampling train. After the new tank is attachedto the sample train, proceed with the sampling until the required minimumsampling time has been exceeded. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4.2 Sample Recovery. After sampling is completed, close the flow controlvalve, and record the final tank vacuum; then record the tank temperatureand barometric pressure. Close the sample tank valve, and disconnect thesample tank from the sample system. Disconnect the condensate trap at theflowmetering system, and tightly seal both ends of the condensate trap.Do not include the probe from the stack to the filter as part of the condensatesample. Keep the trap packed in dry ice until the samples are returnedto the laboratory for analysis. Ensure that the test run number is properlyidentified on the condensate trap and the sample tank(s).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4.3 Condensate Recovery. See Figure 25-9. Set the carrier gas flowrate, and heat the catalyst to its operating temperature to condition theapparatus.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4.3.1 Daily Performance Checks. Each day before analyzing any samples,perform the following tests: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4.3.1.1 Leak Check. With the carrier gas inlets and the flow controlvalve closed, install a clean condensate trap in the system, and evacuatethe system to 10 mm Hg absolute pressure or less.

The system is acceptable if the pressure change is less than 2mm Hg. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4.3.1.2  System Background Test. Adjust the carrier gas and auxiliaryoxygen flow rate to their normal values of 100 cc/min and 150 cc/min, respectively,with the sample recovery valve in vent position. Using a 10-ml syringewithdraw a sample from the system effluent through the syringe port. Injectthis sample into the NMO analyzer, and measure the CO<T2>2</T2> content. The system background is acceptable if the CO<T2>2</T2> concentration is less than 10 ppm. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4.3.1.3  Oxidation Catalyst Efficiency Check.

After sampling is completed,the condensate trap will contain condensed water and organics and a smallvolume of sampled gas. This gas from the stack may contain a significantamount of CO<T2>2</T2> which must be removed from the condensate trap before the sampleis recovered. This is accomplished by purging the condensate trap withzero air and collecting the purged gas in the original sample tank. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Begin with the sample tank and condensate trap from the test run tobe analyzed. Set the four-port valve of the condensate recovery systemin the CO<T2>2</T2> purge position as shown in Figure 25-9. With the sample tankvalve closed, attach the sample tank to the sample recovery system. Withthe sample recovery valve in the vent position and the flow control valvefully open, evacuate the manometer or pressure gauge to the vacuum of thesample tank. Next, close the vacuum pump valve, open the sample tank valve,and record the tank pressure. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Attach the dry-ice-cooled condensate trap to the recovery system,and initiate the purge by switching the sample recovery valve from ventto collect position. Adjust the flow control valve to maintain atmosphericpressure in the recovery system. Continue the purge until the CO<T2>2</T2> concentration of the trap effluent is less than 5 ppm. CO<T2>2</T2> concentration in the trap effluent should be measured by extractingsyringe samples from the recovery system and analyzing the samples withthe NMO analyzer. This procedure should be used only after the NDIR responsehas reached a minimum level. Using a 10-ml syringe, extract a sample fromthe syringe port prior to the NDIR, and inject this sample into the NMOanalyzer. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">After the completion of the CO<T2>2</T2> purge, use the carrier gas bypass valve to pressurize the sampletank to approximately 1060 mm Hg absolute pressure with zero air. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4.3.3 Recovery of the Condensate Trap Sample. See Figure 25-10. Attachthe ICV to the sample recovery system. With the sample recovery valve ina closed position, between vent and collect, and the flow control and ICVvalves fully open, evacuate the manometer or gauge, the connecting tubing,and the ICV to 10 mm Hg absolute pressure. Close the flow-control and vacuumpump valves. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Begin auxiliary oxygen flow to the oxidation catalyst at a rate of150 cc/min, then switch the four-way valve to the trap recovery positionand the sample recovery valve to collect position. The system should nowbe set up to operate as indicated in Figure 25-10. After the manometeror pressure gauge begins to register a slight positive pressure, open theflow control valve. Adjust the flow-control valve to maintain atmosphericpressure in the system within 10 percent. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Now, remove the condensate trap from the dry ice, and allow it towarm to ambient temperature while monitoring the NDIR response. If after5 minutes, the CO<T2>2</T2> concentration of the catalyst effluent is below 10,000 ppm,discontinue the auxiliary oxygen flow to the oxidation catalyst. Beginheating the trap by placing it in a furnace preheated to 200 anddegrees;C.Once heating has begun, carefully monitor the NDIR response to ensure thatthe catalyst effluent concentration does not exceed 50,000 ppm. Wheneverthe CO<T2>2</T2> concentration exceeds 50,000 ppm, supply auxiliary oxygen tothe catalyst at the rate of 150 cc/min. Begin heating the tubing that connectedthe heated sample box to the condensate trap only after the CO<T2>2</T2> concentration falls below 10,000 ppm. This tubing may be heatedin the same oven as the condensate trap or with an auxiliary heat sourcesuch as a heat gun. Heating temperature must not exceed 200 anddegrees;C.If a heat gun is used, heat the tubing slowly along its entire length fromthe upstream end to the downstream end, and repeat the pattern for a totalof three times. Continue the recovery until the CO<T2>2</T2> concentration drops to less than 10 ppm as determined by syringeinjection as described under the condensate trap CO<T2>2</T2> purge Procedure, Section 4.3.2. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">After the sample recovery is completed, use the carrier gas bypassvalve to pressurize the ICV to approximately 1060 mm Hg absolute pressurewith zero air. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4.4 Analysis.
