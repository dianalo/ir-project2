(b) <T3>Applicability. </T3>(1) This part applies to the Office of the Secretaryof Defense (OSD) which includes for the purpose of this Regulation theJoint Staff, Unified Commands, the Military Departments, the Defense Agencies,and the DoD Field Activities (hereafter referred to as ``DoD Components''),and takes precedence over all DoD Component regulations that supplementthe DoD FOIA Program. A list of DoD Components is at Appendix G to thispart. (2) The National Security Agency records are subject to the provisionsof this part, only to the extent the records are not exempt under Pub.L. 86-36. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 286.3 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">DoD public information. </ITAG>(a) <T3>Public information. </T3>The public has a right to information concerningthe activities of its Government. DoD policy is to conduct its activitiesin an open manner and provide the public with a maximum amount of accurateand timely information concerning its activities, consistent always withthe legitimate public and private interests of the American people. A DoDrecord requested by a member of the public who follows rules establishedby proper authority in the Department of Defense shall be withheld onlywhen it is exempt from mandatory public disclosure under the FOIA. In theevent a requested record is exempt under the FOIA, it may nonetheless bereleased when it is determined that no governmental interest will be jeopardizedby the release of the record. In order that the public may have timelyinformation concerning DoD activities, records requested through publicinformation channels by news media representatives that would not be withheldif requested under the FOIA should be released upon request. Prompt responsesto requests for information from news media representatives should be encouragedto eliminate the need for these requesters to invoke the provisions ofthe FOIA and thereby assist in providing timely information to the public.Similarly, requests from other members of the public for information shouldcontinue to be honored through appropriate means even though the requestdoes not qualify under FOIA requirements. (b) <T3>Control system. </T3>A request for records that invokes the FOIA shallenter a formal control system designed to ensure compliance with the FOIA.A release determination must be made and the requester informed withinthe time limits specified in this part. Any request for DoD records thateither explicitly or implicitly cites the FOIA shall be processed underthe provisions of this part or under the Privacy Act, when the requestis from the subject of the records requested. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 286.5 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Definitions. </ITAG>As used in this part, the following terms and meanings shall be applicable.<T3>Administrative appeal. </T3>A request by a member of the general public,made under the FOIA, asking the appellate authority of a DoD Componentto reverse an IDA decision to withhold all or part of a requested recordor to deny a request for waiver or reduction of fees. <T3>Agency record. </T3>(a) The products of data compilation, regardlessof physical form or characteristics, made or received by a DoD Componentin connection with the transaction of public business and preserved bya DoD Component primarily as evidence of the organization, policies, functions,decisions, or procedures of the DoD Component. (b) The following are not included within the definition of the word ``record'':(1) Library and museum material made, acquired, and preserved solely forreference or exhibition. (2) Objects or articles, such as structures, furniture, paintings, sculpture,three-dimensional models, vehicles and equipment, whatever their historicalvalue, or value as evidence. (3) Commercially exploitable resources and administrative tools by whichrecords are created, stored, and retrieved, including but not limited to:(i) Maps, charts, map compilation manuscripts, map research materials anddata if not created or used as primary sources of information about organizations,policies, functions, decisions, or procedures of a DoD Component. (ii) Computer software, if not created or used as primary sources of informationabout organizations, policies, functions, decisions, or procedures of aDoD Component. (This does not include the underlying data which is processedand produced by such software and which may in some instances be storedwith the software.) (4) Unaltered publications and processed documents, such as regulations,manuals, maps, charts, and related geophysical materials, that are availableto the public through an established distribution system with or withoutcharges. (5) Anything that is not a tangible or documentary record, such as an individual'smemory or oral communication. (6) Personal records of an individual not subject to agency creation orretention requirements, created and maintained primarily for the convenienceof an agency employee, and not distributed to other agency employees fortheir official use.  (7) Information stored within a computer for which there is no existingcomputer program or printout. (c) A record must exist and be controlled by the Department of Defenseat the time of the request to be considered subject to this part. Thereis no obligation to create, compile, or obtain a record to satisfy an FOIArequest. <T3>Appellate authority. </T3>The Head of the DoD Component or the Componenthead's designee having jurisdiction for this purpose over the record. <T3>DoD component. </T3>An element of the Department of Defense, as definedin andSection; 286.1(b), authorized to receive and act independently on FOIArequests. A DoD Component has its own initial denial authority (IDA) orappellate authority, and general counsel. <T3>FOIA request. </T3>A written request for DoD records, made by a memberof the public, that either explicitly or implicitly invokes the FOIA, 32CFR part 285, this part, or DoD Component supplementing regulations orinstructions. <T3>Initial denial authority (IDA). </T3>An official who has been grantedauthority by the head of a DoD Component to withhold records requestedunder the FOIA for one or more of the nine categories of records exemptfrom mandatory disclosure. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 286.7 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Policy. </ITAG>(a) <T3>Compliance with the FOIA. </T3>DoD personnel are expected to complywith the FOIA and this part in both letter and spirit. This strict adherenceis necessary to provide uniformity in the implementation of the DoD FOIAProgram and to create conditions that will promote public trust. (b) <T3>Openness with the public. </T3>The Department of Defense shall conductits activities in an open manner consistent with the need for securityand adherence to other requirements of law and regulation. Records notspecifically exempt from disclosure under the Act shall, upon request,be made readily accessible to the public in accordance with rules promulgatedby competent authority, whether or not the Act is invoked. (c) <T3>Avoidance of procedural obstacles. </T3>DoD Components shall ensurethat procedural matters do not unnecessarily impede a requester from obtainingDoD records promptly. Components shall provide assistance to requestersto help them understand and comply with procedures established by thispart and any supplemental part published by the DoD Components. (d) <T3>Prompt action on requests. </T3>When a member of the public complieswith the procedures established in this part for obtaining DoD records,the request shall receive prompt attention; a reply shall be dispatchedwithin 10 working days, unless a delay is authorized. When a Componenthas a significant number of requests, e.g., 10 or more, the requests shallbe processed in order of receipt. However, this does not preclude a Componentfrom completing action on a request which can be easily answered, regardlessof its ranking within the order of receipt. Requests by individuals foraccess to records about themselves are processed under the provisions ofthe respective Act cited in the request. Requests that cite both Acts orneither Act are processed under both Acts, using the fee provisions ofthe Federal Privacy Act and the time limits of the FOIA. If access is controlledby another Federal statute, follow the provisions of the controlling statuteand andSection; 286.15(a)(3). For further details, see DoD 5400.11-R.\2\<NOTE/> Even though a request that invokes the FOIA is administrativelyprocessed under Privacy Act procedures, no record shall be withheld thatwould be released under FOIA procedures.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Copies may be obtained at cost, from the National TechnicalInformation Service, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161. (e) <T3>Use of exemptions. </T3>Records that may be withheld under the exemptionsoutlined in Subpart C of this part shall be made available to the publicwhen it is determined that no governmental interest will be jeopardizedby their release. Determination of jeopardy to governmental interest iswithin the sole discretion of the Component, consistent with statutoryrequirements, security classification requirements, or other requirementsof law. (f) <T3>Public domain. </T3>Nonexempt records released under the authorityof this part are considered to be in the public domain. Nonexempt recordsmaintained in a DoD Component's Public Reading Room, or which can be madeavailable in the Public Reading Room within a short time frame (15 minutesor less) are considered to be in the public domain. Exempt records releasedpursuant to this part or other statutory or regulatory authority, however,may be considered to be in the public domain only when their release constitutesa waiver of the FOIA exemption. When the release does not constitute sucha waiver, such as when disclosure is made to a properly constituted advisorycommittee or to a Congressional Committee, the released records do notlose their exempt status. Also, while authority may exist to disclose recordsto individuals in their official capacity, the provisions of this partapply if the same individual seeks the records in a private or personalcapacity. (g) <T3>Creating a record. </T3>A record must exist and be in the possessionand control of the Department of Defense at the time of the search to beconsidered subject to this part. Mere possession of a record does not presumedepartmental control and such records, or identifiable portions thereof,would be referred to the originating Agency for direct response to therequester. There is no obligation to create nor compile a record to satisfyan FOIA request. A DoD Component,  however, may compile a new record whenso doing would result in a more useful response to the requester, or beless burdensome to the agency than providing existing records, and therequester does not object. Cost of creating or compiling such a recordmay not be charged to the requester unless the fee for creating the recordis equal to or less than the fee which would be charged for providing theexisting record. Fee assessment for direct search, review (in the caseof commercial requesters), and duplication associated with the requestshall be in accordance with andSection; 286.35(b). (h) <T3>Description of requested record. </T3>(1) Identification of the recorddesired is the responsibility of the member of the public who requestsa record. The requester must provide a description of the desired record,that enables the Government to locate the record with a reasonable amountof effort. The Act does not authorize ``fishing expeditions.'' When a DoDComponent receives a request that does not ``reasonably describe'' therequested record, it shall notify the requester of the defect. The defectshould be highlighted in a specificity letter, asking the requester toprovide the type of information outlined of this part. Components are notobligated to act on the request until the requester responds to the specificityletter andSection; 286.7(h)(2). When practicable, Components shall offerassistance to the requester in identifying the records sought and in reformulatingthe request to reduce the burden on the agency in complying with the Act.(2) The following guidelines are provided to deal with ``fishing expedition''requests and are based on the principle of reasonable effort. Descriptiveinformation about a record may be divided into two broad categories.(i) Category I is file-related and includes information such as type ofrecord (for example, memorandum), title, index citation, subject area,date the record was created, and originator. (ii) Category II is event-related and includes the circumstances that resultedin the record being created or the date and circumstances surrounding theevent the record covers. (3) Generally, a record is not reasonably described unless the descriptioncontains sufficient Category I information to permit the conduct of anorganized, nonrandom search based on the Component's filing arrangementsand existing retrieval systems, or unless the record contains sufficientCategory II information to permit inference of the Category I elementsneeded to conduct such a search. (4) The following guidelines deal with requests for personal records. Ordinarily,when personal identifiers are provided only in connection with a requestfor records concerning the requester, only records retrievable by personalidentifiers need be searched. Search for such records may be conductedunder Privacy Act procedures. No record may be denied that is releasableunder the FOIA. (5) The above guidelines notwithstanding, the decision of the DoD Componentconcerning reasonableness of description must be based on knowledge ofits files. If the description enables DoD Component personnel to locatethe record with reasonable effort, the description is adequate. (i) <T3>Referrals.</T3> (1) A request received by a DoD Component having norecords responsive to a request shall be referred routinely to anotherDoD Component, if the other Component confirms that it has the requestedrecord, and this belief can be confirmed by the other DoD Component. Incases where the Component receiving the request has reason to believe thatthe existence or nonexistence of the record may in itself be classified,that Component shall consult the DoD Component having cognizance over therecord in question before referring the request. If the DoD Component thatis consulted determines that the existence or nonexistence of the recordis in itself classified, the requester shall be so notified by the DoDComponent originally receiving the request, and no referral shall takeplace. Otherwise, the request shall be referred to the other DoD Component,and the requester shall be notified of any such referral. Any DoD Componentreceiving a request that has been misaddressed shall refer the requestto the proper address and advise the requester. (2) Whenever a record or a portion of a record is, after prior consultation,referred to another DoD Component or to a Government agency outside ofthe Department of Defense for a release determination and direct response,the requester shall be informed of the referral. Referred records shallonly be identified to the extent consistent with security requirements.(3) A DoD Component shall refer an FOIA request for a classified recordthat it holds to another DoD Component or agency outside the Departmentof Defense, if the record originated in the other DoD Component or outsideagency or if the classification is derivative. In this situation, providethe record and a release recommendation on the record with the referralaction. (4) A DoD Component may refer a request for a record that it originatedto another DoD Component or agency when the record was created for theuse of the other DoD Component or agency. The DoD Component or agency forwhich the record was created may have an equally valid interest in withholdingthe record as the DoD Component that created the record. In such situations,provide the record and a release recommendation on the record with thereferral action. An example of such a situation is a request for auditreports prepared by the Defense Contract Audit Agency. These advisory reportsare prepared for the use of contracting officers and their release to theaudited contractor should be at the discretion of the contracting officer.Any FOIA request shall be referred to the appropriate contracting officerand the requester shall be notified of the referral. (5) Within the Department of Defense, a Component shall ordinarily referan FOIA request for a record that it holds, but that was originated byanother DoD Component or that contains substantial information obtainedfrom another DoD Component, to that Component for direct response, afterdirect coordination and obtaining concurrence from the Component. The requesterthen shall be notified of such referral. DoD Components shall not, in anycase, release or deny such records without prior consultation with theother DoD Component. (6) DoD Components that receive referred requests shall answer them inaccordance with the time limits established by the FOIA and this part.Those time limits shall begin to run upon receipt of the referral by theofficial designated to respond. (7) Agencies outside the Department of Defense that are subject to theFOIA: (i) A Component may refer an FOIA request for any record that originatedin an agency outside the DoD or that is based on information obtained froman outside agency to the agency for direct response to the requester aftercoordination with the outside agency, if that agency is subject to FOIA.Otherwise, the Component must respond to the request. (ii) A DoD Component shall not honor any FOIA request for investigative,intelligence, or any other type of records that are on loan to the Departmentof Defense for a specific purpose, if the records are restricted from furtherrelease and so marked. Such requests shall be referred to the agency thatprovided the record. (iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in paragraph (i) of thissection, a Component shall notify requesters seeking National SecurityCouncil (NSC) or White House documents that they should write directlyto the NSC or White House for such documents. DoD documents in which theNSC or White House has a concurrent reviewing interest shall be forwardedto the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Public Affairs) (OASD(PA)),ATTN: Directorate For Freedom of Information and Security Review (DFOISR),which shall effect coordination with the NSC or White House, and returnthe documents to the originating agency after NSC review and determination.NSC or White House documents discovered in Components' files which areresponsive to the FOIA request shall be forwarded to OASD(PA), ATTN: DFOISR,for subsequent coordination with the NSC or White House, and returned tothe Component with a release determination. (8) To the extent referrals are consistent with the policies expressedby this paragraph, referrals between offices of the same DoD Componentare authorized. (9) On occasion, the Department of Defense receives FOIA requests for GovernmentAccounting Office (GAO) documents containing DoD information, either directlyfrom requesters, or as referrals from the GAO. The GAO is outside the ExecutiveBranch, and as such, all FOIA requests for GAO documents containing DoDinformation will be processed under the provisions of Security Review orMandatory Declassification Review (MDR) Directives. Requests received inDoD for unclassified GAO reports containing DoD information shall be transferredto the GAO Distribution Center, ATTN: DHISF, P.O. Box 6015, Gaithersburg,MD 20877-1450. Requests received in the Department of Defense for classifiedGAO documents (or documents unidentifiable as to classification) shallbe referred to the GAO, Office of Security and Safety, Washington, DC 20548.After internal review, the GAO shall refer the request and documents toOffice of the Inspector General, Department of Defense (OIG, DoD) and thatComponent shall refer the action to the OASD(PA), ATTN: DFOISR, for processingunder Security Review or MDR provisions. (j) <T3>Authentication.</T3> Records provided under this part shall be authenticatedwith an appropriate seal, whenever necessary, to fulfill an official Governmentor other legal function. This service, however, is in addition to thatrequired under the FOIA and is not included in the FOIA fee schedule. DoDComponents may charge for the service at a rate of $5.20 for each authentication.(k) <T3>Unified and Specified Commands.</T3> (1) The Unified Commands are placedunder the jurisdiction of the OSD, instead of the administering MilitaryDepartment, only for the purpose of administering the DoD FOIA Program.This policy represents an exception to the policies directed in DoD Directive5100.3 \3\<NOTE/> it authorizes and requires the Unified Commands to processFreedom of Information (FOI) requests in accordance with DoD Directive5400.7 and this part. The Unified Commands shall forward directly to theOASD(PA), all correspondence associated with the appeal of an initial denialfor records under the provisions of the FOIA. Procedures to effect thisadministrative requirement are outlined in Appendix A of this part.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ See footnote 1 to andSection; 286.1(a).(2) The Specified Commands remain under the jurisdiction of the administeringMilitary Department. The Commands shall designate IDAs within their headquarters;however, the appellate authority shall reside with the Military Department.(1) <T3>Records management. </T3>FOIA records shall be maintained and disposedof in accordance with DoD Component Disposition instructions and schedules.<ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart B_FOIA Reading Rooms </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 286.9 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Requirements. </ITAG>(a) <T3>Reading room. </T3>Each Component shall provide an appropriate facilityor facilities where the public may inspect and copy or have copied thematerials described below. DoD Components may share reading room facilitiesif the public is not unduly inconvenienced. The cost of copying shall beimposed on the person requesting the material in accordance with the provisionsof Subpart F of this part. (b) <T3>Material availability. </T3>The FOIA requires that so-called ``(a)(2)''materials shall be made available in the FOIA reading room for inspectionand copying, unless such materials are published and copies are offeredfor sale. Identifying details that, if revealed, would create a clearlyunwarranted invasion of personal privacy may be deleted from ``(a)(2)''materials made available for inspection and copying. In every case, justificationfor the deletion must be fully explained in writing. However, a DoD Componentmay publish in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> a description of the basis upon which it willdelete identifying details of particular types of documents to avoid clearlyunwarranted invasions of privacy. In appropriate cases, the DoD Componentmay refer to this description rather than write a separate justificationfor each deletion. So-called ``(a)(2)'' materials are: (1) Final opinions, including concurring and dissenting opinions, and ordersmade in the adjudication of cases, as defined in 5 U.S.C. 551, that maybe cited, used, or relied upon as precedents in future adjudications. (2) Statements of policy and interpretations that have been adopted bythe agency and are not published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. (3) Administrative staff manuals and instructions, or portions thereof,that establish DoD policy or interpretations of policy that affect a memberof the public. This provision does not apply to instructions for employeeson tactics and techniques to be used in performing their duties, or toinstructions relating only to the internal management of the DoD Component.Examples of manuals and instructions not normally made available are: (i) Those issued for audit, investigation, and inspection purposes, orthose that prescribe operational tactics, standards of performance, orcriteria for defense, prosecution, or settlement of cases. (ii) Operations and maintenance manuals and technical information concerningmunitions, equipment, systems, and foreign intelligence operations. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 286.11 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Indexes. </ITAG>(a) <T3>``(a)(2)'' Materials. </T3>(1) Each DoD Component shall maintain ineach facility prescribed in andSection; 286.11(a), an index of materialsdescribed in andSection; 286.11(b), that are issued, adopted, or promulgated,after July 4, 1967. No ``(a)(2)'' materials issued, promulgated, or adoptedafter July 4, 1967 that are not indexed and either made available or publishedmay be relied upon, used or cited as precedent against any individual unlesssuch individual has actual and timely notice of the contents of such materials.Such materials issued, promulgated, or adopted before July 4, 1967, neednot be indexed, but must be made available upon request if not exemptedunder this part. (2) Each DoD Component shall promptly publish quarterly or more frequently,and distribute, by sale or otherwise, copies of each index of ``(a)(2)''materials or supplements thereto unless it publishes in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> an order containing a determination that publicationis unnecessary  and impracticable. A copy of each index or supplement notpublished shall be provided to a requester at a cost not to exceed thedirect cost of duplication as set forth in subpart F of this part. (3) Each index of ``(a)(2)'' materials or supplement thereto shall be arrangedtopically or by descriptive words rather than by case name or numberingsystem so that members of the public can readily locate material. Casename and numbering arrangements, however, may also be included for DoDComponent convenience. (b) <T3>Other materials. </T3>(1) Any available index of DoD Component materialpublished in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, such as material required to be published bySection 552(a)(1) of the FOIA, shall be made available in DoD ComponentFOIA reading rooms.(2) Although not required to be made available in response to FOIA requestsor made available in FOIA reading rooms, ``(a)(1)'' materials shall, whenfeasible, be made available in FOIA reading rooms for inspection and copying.Examples of ``(a)(1)'' materials are: descriptions of an agency's centraland field organization, and to the extent they affect the public, rulesof procedures, descriptions of forms available, instruction as to the scopeand contents of papers, reports, or examinations, and any amendment, revision,or report of the aforementioned. <ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart C_Exemptions </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 286.13 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">General provisions. </ITAG>(a) <T3>General. </T3>Records that meet the exemption criteria in andSection;286.15 may be withheld from public disclosure and need not be publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, made available in a library reading room, orprovided in response to an FOIA request. (b) <T3>Jeopardy of government interest. </T3>An exempted record, other thanthose being withheld pursuant to Exemptions  1, 3 or 6, shall be made availableupon the request of any individual when, in the judgment of the releasingDoD Component or higher authority, no jeopardy to government interest wouldbe served by release. It is appropriate for DoD Components to use theirdiscretionary authority on a case-by-case basis in the release of givenrecords. If a DoD Component determines that a record requested under theFOIA meets the Exemption 4 withholding criteria set forth in this part,the DoD Component shall not ordinarily exercise its discretionary powerto release, absent circumstances in which a compelling public interestwill be served by release of that record. Further guidance on this issuemay be found at andSection; 286.13(a)(4) and andSection; 286.29(h). <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 286.15 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Exemptions. </ITAG>(a) <T3>FOIA exemptions. </T3>The following types of records may be withheldin whole or in part from public disclosure under the FOIA, unless otherwiseprescribed by law. (1) <T3>Number 1. </T3>Those properly and currently classified in the interestof national defense or foreign policy, as specifically authorized underthe criteria established by executive order and implemented by regulations,such as 32 CFR part 159a. Although material is not classified at the timeof the FOIA request, a classification review may be undertaken to determinewhether the information should be classified. The procedures in DoD 5200.1-R,\4\<NOTE/> section 2-204f., apply. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ See footnote 2 to andSection; 286.7(d). (2) <T3>Number 2. </T3>Those containing or constituting rules, regulations,orders, manuals, directives, and instructions relating to the internalpersonnel rules or practices of a DoD Component if their release to thepublic would substantially hinder the effective performance of a significantfunction of the Department of Defense and they do not impose requirementsdirectly on the general public. Examples include: (i) Those operating rules, guidelines, and manuals for DoD investigators,inspectors, auditors, or examiners that must remain privileged in orderfor the DoD Component to fulfill a legal requirement. (ii) Personnel and other administrative matters, such as examination questionsand answers used in training courses or in the determination of the qualificationsof candidates for employment, entrance on duty, advancement, or promotion.(iii) Lists of DoD personnel names and duty addresses (civilian and military)created primarily for internal, trivial, housekeeping purposes for whichthere is no legitimate public interest or benefit. This exemption is appropriatewhen it would impose an administrative burden to process the request, andthe requester is not seeking the information for the benefit of the generalpublic (see also paragraph (a)(6)(ii) of this section). (3) <T3>Number 3. </T3>Those concerning matters that a statute specificallyexempts from disclosure by terms that permit no discretion on the issue,or in accordance with criteria established by that statute for withholdingor referring to particular types of matters to be withheld. Examples ofstatutes are: (i) National Security Agency Information Exemption, Public law 86-36, section6. (ii) Patent Secrecy, 35 U.S.C. 181-188. Any records containing informationrelating to inventions that are the subject of patent applications on whichPatent Secrecy Orders have been issued. (iii) Restricted Data and Formerly Restricted Data, 42 U.S.C. 2162. (iv) Communication Intelligence, 18 U.S.C. 798. (v) Authority to Withhold From Public Disclosure Certain Technical Data,10 U.S.C. 130 and DoD Directive 5230.25.\5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ See footnote 1 to andSection; 286.1(a).(vi) Confidentiality of Medical Quality Records: Qualified Immunity Participants,10 U.S.C. 1102. (4) <T3>Number 4.</T3> Those containing trade secrets or commercial or financialinformation that a DoD Component receives from a person or organizationoutside the Government with the understanding that the information or recordwill be retained on a privileged or confidential basis in accordance withthe customary handling of such records. Records within the exemption mustcontain trade secrets, or commercial or financial records, the disclosureof which is likely to cause substantial harm to the competitive positionof the source providing the information; impair the Government's abilityto obtain necessary information in the future; or impair some other legitimategovernment interest. Examples include records that contain: (i) Commercial or financial information received in confidence in connectionwith loans, bids, contracts, or proposals, as well as other informationreceived in confidence or privileged, such as trade secrets, inventions,discoveries, or other proprietary data. (ii) Statistical data and commercial or financial information concerningcontract performance, income, profits, losses, and expenditures, if offeredand received in confidence from a contractor or potential contractor. (iii) Personal statements given in the course of inspections, investigations,or audits, when such statements are received in confidence from the individualand retained in confidence because they reveal trade secrets or commercialor financial information normally considered confidential or privileged.(iv) Financial data provided in confidence by private employers in connectionwith locality wage surveys that are used to fix and adjust pay schedulesapplicable to the prevailing wage rate of employees within the Departmentof Defense. (v) Scientific and manufacturing processes or developments concerning technicalor scientific data or other information submitted with an application fora research grant, or with a report while research is in progress. (vi) Technical or scientific data developed by a contractor or subcontractorexclusively at private expense, and technical or scientific data developedin part with federal funds and in part at private expense, wherein thecontractor or subcontractor has retained legitimate proprietary interestsin such data in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2320-2321 and DoD Federal AcquisitionRegulation Supplement (DFARS), subpart 27.4. Technical data developed exclusivelywith Federal funds may be withheld under Exemption Number 3 if it meetsthe criteria of 10 U.S.C. 130 and DoD Directive 5230.25 (32 CFR part 250)(see paragraph (a)(3)(v) of this section). (5) <T3>Number 5.</T3> Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(5) (ii) through(v) of this section, internal advice, recommendations, and subjective evaluations,as contrasted with factual matters, that are reflected in records pertainingto the decision-making process of an agency, whether within or among agencies(as defined in 5 U.S.C. 552(e)), or within or among DoD Components. (i) Examples include: (A) The nonfactual portions of staff papers, to include after-action reportsand situation reports containing staff evaluations, advice, opinions, orsuggestions. (B) Advice, suggestions, or evaluations prepared on behalf of the Departmentof Defense by individual consultants or by boards, committees, councils,groups, panels, conferences, commissions, task forces, or other similargroups that are formed for the purpose of obtaining advice and recommendations.(C) Those nonfactual portions of evaluations by DoD Component personnelof contractors and their products. (D) Information of a speculative, tentative, or evaluative nature or suchmatters as proposed plans to procure, lease or otherwise acquire and disposeof materials, real estate, facilities or functions, when such informationwould provide undue or unfair competitive advantage to private personalinterests or would impede legitimate government functions. (E) Trade secret or other confidential research development, or commercialinformation owned by the Government, where premature release is likelyto affect the Government's negotiating position or other commercial interests.(F) Records that are exchanged among agency personnel and within and amongDoD Components or agencies as part of the preparation for anticipated administrativeproceeding by an agency or litigation before any Federal, State, or militarycourt, as well as records that qualify for the attorney-client privilege.(G) Those portions of official reports of inspection, reports of the InspectorGenerals, audits, investigations, or surveys pertaining to safety, security,or the internal management, administration, or operation of one or moreDoD Components, when these records have traditionally been treated by thecourts as privileged against disclosure in litigation. (ii) If any such intra or interagency record or reasonably segregable portionof such record hypothetically would be made available routinely throughthe ``discovery process'' in the course of litigation with the agency,i.e., the process by which litigants obtain information from each otherthat is relevant to the issues in a trial or hearing, then it should notbe withheld from the general public even though discovery has not beensought in actual litigation. If, however, the information hypotheticallywould only be made available through the discovery process by special orderof the court based on the particular needs of a litigant, balanced againstthe interests of the agency in maintaining its confidentiality, then therecord or document need not be made available under this part. (iii) Intra or interagency memoranda or letters that are factual, or thosereasonably segregable portions that are factual, are routinely made availablethrough ``discovery,'' and shall be made available to a requester, unlessthe factual material is otherwise exempt from release, inextricably intertwinedwith the exempt information, so fragmented as to be uninformative, or soredundant of information already available to the requester as to provideno new substantive information. (iv) A direction or order from a superior to a subordinate, though containedin an internal communication, generally cannot be withheld from a requesterif it constitutes policy guidance or a decision, as distinguished froma discussion of preliminary matters or a request for information or advicethat would compromise the decision-making process. (v) An internal communication concerning a decision that subsequently hasbeen made a matter of public record must be made available to a requesterwhen the rationale for the decision is expressly adopted or incorporatedby reference in the record containing the decision. (6) <T3>Number 6.</T3> Information in personnel and medical files, as wellas similar personal information in other files, that, if disclosed to therequester would result in a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.(i) Examples of other files containing personal information similar tothat contained in personnel and medical files include: (A) Those compiled to evaluate or adjudicate the suitability of candidatesfor civilian employment or membership in the Armed Forces, and the eligibilityof individuals (civilian, military, or contractor employees) for securityclearances, or for access to particularly sensitive classified information.(B) Files containing reports, records, and other material pertaining topersonnel matters in which administrative action, including disciplinaryaction, may be taken. (ii) In determining whether the release of information would result ina ``clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,'' consideration shallbe given to the stated or ascertained purpose of the request. When determiningwhether a release is ``clearly unwarranted,'' the public interest in satisfyingthis purpose must be balanced against the sensitivity of the privacy interestbeing threatened. One example of such is lists of names and duty addressesof DoD personnel (civilian and military) assigned to units that are sensitive,routinely deployable, or stationed in foreign territories. Release of suchinformation could aid in the targeting of DoD employees and their familiesby terrorists (see also paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section). This exemptionshall not be exercised in an attempt to protect the privacy of a deceasedperson, but it may be used to protect the privacy of the deceased person'sfamily.(iii) Individuals' personnel, medical, or similar file may be withheldfrom them or their designated legal representative only to the extent consistentwith DoD Directive 5400.11\6\<NOTE/> (32 CFR part 286a).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ See footnote 1 to andSection; 286.1(a). (iv) A clearly unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the persons identifiedin a personnel, medical or similar record may constitute a basis for deletingthose reasonably segregable portions of that record, even when providingit to the subject of the record. (7) <T3>Number 7. </T3>Records or information compiled for law enforcementpurposes; i.e., civil, criminal, or military law, including the implementationof executive orders or regulations issued pursuant to law. (i) This exemption applies, however, only to the extent that productionof such law enforcement records or information could result in the following:(A) Could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings.(B) Would deprive a person of the right to a fair trial or to an impartialadjudication. (C) Could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasionof personal privacy of a living person, including surviving family membersof an individual identified in such a record. (D) Could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a confidentialsource, including a source within the Department of Defense, a State, local,or foreign agency or authority, or any private institution which furnishesthe information on a confidential basis. (E) Could disclose information furnished from a confidential source andobtained by a criminal law enforcement authority in a criminal investigationor by an agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence investigation.(F) Would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigationsor prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigationsor prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to riskcircumvention of the law. (G) Could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safetyof any individual. (ii) Examples include: (A) Statements of witnesses and other material developed during the courseof the investigation and all materials prepared in connection with relatedgovernment litigation or adjudicative proceedings. (B) The identity of firms or individuals being investigated for allegedirregularities involving contracting with the Department of Defense whenno indictment has been obtained nor any civil action filed against themby the United States. (C) Information obtained in confidence, expressed or implied, in the courseof a criminal investigation by a criminal law enforcement agency or officewithin a DoD Component, or a lawful national security intelligence investigationconducted by an authorized agency or office within a DoD Component. Nationalsecurity intelligence investigations include background security investigationsand those investigations conducted for the purpose of obtaining affirmativeor counterintelligence information. (iii) The right of individual litigants to investigative records currentlyavailable by law (such as, the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. 3500), is not diminished.(iv) When the subject of an investigative record is the requester of therecord, it may be withheld only as authorized by DoD Directive 5400.11.(v) Exclusions. Excluded from the above exemption are the following twosituations applicable to the Department of Defense:  (A) Whenever a request is made which involves access to records or informationcompiled for law enforcement purposes, and the investigation or proceedinginvolves a possible violation of criminal law where there is reason tobelieve that the subject of the investigation or proceeding is unawareof its pendency, and the disclosure of the existence of the records couldreasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings, Componentsmay, during only such times as that circumstance continues, treat the recordsor information as not subject to exemption 7. In such situation, the responseto the requester will state that no records were found. (B) Whenever informant records maintained by a criminal law enforcementorganization within a DoD Component under the informant's name or personalidentifier are requested by a third party using the informant's name orpersonal identifier, the Component may treat the records as not subjectto exemption 7, unless the informant's status as an informant has beenofficially confirmed. If it is determined that the records are not subjectto exemption 7, the response to the requester will state that no recordswere found. (8) <T3>Number 8. </T3>Those contained in or related to examination, operationor condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of any agencyresponsible for the regulation or supervision of financial institutions.(9) <T3>Number 9. </T3>Those containing geological and geophysical informationand data (including maps) concerning wells. <ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart D_For Official Use Only </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 286.17 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">General provisions. </ITAG>(a) <T3>General. </T3>Information that has not been given a security classificationpursuant to the criteria of an Executive Order, but which may be withheldfrom the public for one or more of the reasons cited in FOIA exemptions2 through 9 shall be considered as being for official use only. No othermaterial shall be considered  or marked ``For Official Use Only'' (FOUO),and FOUO is not authorized as an anemic form of classification to protectnational security interests. (b) <T3>Prior FOUO application. </T3>The prior application of FOUO markingsis not a conclusive basis for withholding a record that is requested underthe FOIA. When such a record is requested, the information in it shallbe evaluated to determine whether, under current circumstances, FOIA exemptionsapply in withholding the record or portions of it. If any exemption orexemptions apply or applies, it may nonetheless be released when it isdetermined that no governmental interest will be jeopardized by its release.(c) <T3>Historical papers. </T3>Records such as notes, working papers, anddrafts retained as historical evidence of DoD Component actions enjoy nospecial status apart from the exemptions under the FOIA. (d) <T3>Time to mark records. </T3>The marking of records at the time of theircreation provides notice of FOUO content and facilitates review when arecord is requested under the FOIA. Records requested under the FOIA thatdo not bear such markings, shall not be assumed to be releasable withoutexamination for the presence of information that requires continued protectionand qualifies as exempt from public release. (e) <T3>Distribution statement. </T3>Information in a technical document thatrequires a distribution statement pursuant to DoD Directive 5230.24 \7\<NOTE/> shall bear that statement and shall not be marked FOUO. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ See footnote 1 to andSection; 286.1(a). <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 286.19 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Markings. </ITAG>(a) <T3>Location of markings. </T3>(1) An unclassified document containingFOUO information shall be marked ``For Official Use Only'' at the bottomon the outside of the front cover (if any), on the first page, on the backpage, and on the outside of the back cover (if any). (2) Within a classified document, an individual page that contains bothFOUO and classified information shall be marked at the top and bottom withthe highest security classification of information appearing on the page.(3) Within a classified or unclassified document, an individual page thatcontains FOUO information but no classified information shall be marked``For Official Use Only'' at the bottom of the page. (4) Other records, such as, photographs, films, tapes, or slides, shallbe marked ``For Official Use Only'' or ``FOUO'' in a manner that ensuresthat a recipient or viewer is aware of the status of the information therein.(5) FOUO material transmitted outside the Department of Defense requiresapplication of an expanded marking to explain the significance of the FOUOmarking. This may be accomplished by typing or stamping the following statementon the record prior to transfer:<ITAG tagnum="21">This document contains information EXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSUREunder the FOIA. Exemptions * * * apply. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 286.21 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Dissemination and transmission. </ITAG>(a) <T3>Release and transmission procedures. </T3>Until FOUO status is terminated,the release and transmission instructions that follow apply:(1) FOUO information may be disseminated within DoD Components and betweenofficials of DoD Components and DoD contractors, consultants, and granteesto conduct official business for the Department of Defense. Recipientsshall be made aware of the status of such information, and transmissionshall be by means that preclude unauthorized public disclosure. Transmittaldocuments shall call attention to the presence of FOUO attachments. (2) DoD holders of FOUO information are authorized to convey such informationto officials in other departments and agencies of the executive and judicialbranches to fulfill a government function, except to the extent prohibitedby the Privacy Act. Records thus transmitted shall be marked ``For OfficialUse Only'', and the recipient shall be advised that the information hasbeen exempted from public disclosure, pursuant to the FOIA, and that specialhandling instructions do or do not apply. (3) Release of FOUO information to Members of Congress is governed by DoDDirective 5400.4 \8\<NOTE/>. Release to the GAO is governed by DoD Directive 7650.1\9\<NOTE/>. Records released to the Congress or GAO should be reviewedto determine whether the information warrants FOUO status. If not, priorFOUO markings shall be removed or effaced. If withholding criteria aremet, the records shall be marked FOUO and the recipient provided an explanationfor such exemption and marking. Alternatively, the recipient may be requested,without marking the record, to protect against its public disclosure forreasons that are explained. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ See footnote 1 to andSection; 281.1(a).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ See footnote 1 to andSection; 281.1(a).(b) <T3>Transporting FOUO information.</T3> Records containing FOUO informationshall be transported in a manner that precludes disclosure of the contents.When not commingled with classified information, FOUO information may besent via first-class mail or parcel post. Bulky shipments, such as distributionsof FOUO Directives or testing materials, that otherwise qualify under postalregulations may be sent by fourth-class mail. (c) <T3>Electrically transmitted messages.</T3> Each part of electrically transmittedmessages containing FOUO information shall be marked appropriately. Unclassifiedmessages containing FOUO information shall contain the abbreviation ``FOUO''before the beginning of the text. Such messages shall be transmitted inaccordance with communications security procedures in ACP-121 (US Supp1) for FOUO information. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 286.23</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Safeguarding FOUO information. </ITAG>(a) <T3>During duty hours.</T3> During normal working hours, records determinedto be FOUO shall be placed in an out-of-sight location if the work areais accessible to nongovernmental personnel. (b) <T3>During nonduty hours.</T3> At the close of business, FOUO records shallbe stored so as to preclude unauthorized access. Filing such material withother unclassified records in unlocked files or desks, etc., is adequatewhen normal U.S. Government or government-contractor internal buildingsecurity is provided during nonduty hours. When such internal securitycontrol is not exercised, locked buildings or rooms normally provide adequateafter-hours protection. If such protection is not considered adequate,FOUO material shall be stored in locked receptacles such as file cabinets,desks, or bookcases. FOUO records that are subject to the provisions ofPub. L. 86-36 shall meet the safeguards outlined for that group of records.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 286.25</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Termination, disposal and unauthorized disclosures. </ITAG>(a) <T3>Termination.</T3> The originator or other competent authority, e.g.,initial denial and appellate authorities, shall terminate ``For OfficialUse Only'' markings or status when circumstances indicate that the informationno longer requires protection from public disclosure. When FOUO statusis terminated, all known holders shall be notified, to the extent practical.Upon notification, holders shall efface or remove the ``For Official UseOnly'' markings, but records in file or storage need not be retrieved solelyfor that purpose. (b) <T3>Disposal.</T3> (1) Nonrecord copies of FOUO materials may be destroyedby tearing each copy into pieces to preclude reconstructing, and placingthem in regular trash containers. When local circumstances or experienceindicates that this destruction method is not sufficiently protective ofFOUO information, local authorities may direct other methods but must givedue consideration to the additional expense balanced against the degreeof sensitivity of the type of FOUO information contained in the records.(2) Record copies of FOUO documents shall be disposed of in accordancewith the disposal standards established under 44 U.S.C. Chapter 33 as implementedby DoD Component instructions concerning records disposal. (c) <T3>Unauthorized disclosure.</T3> The unauthorized disclosure of FOUO recordsdoes not constitute an unauthorized disclosure of DoD information classifiedfor security purposes. Appropriate administrative action shall be taken,however, to fix responsibility for unauthorized disclosure whenever feasible,and appropriate disciplinary action shall be taken against those responsible.Unauthorized disclosure of FOUO information that is protected by the PrivacyAct may also result in criminal sanctions against responsible persons.The DoD Component that originated the FOUO information shall be informedof its unauthorized disclosure.<ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart E_Release and Processing Procedures</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 286.27</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">General provisions. </ITAG>(a) <T3>Public information.</T3> (1) Since the policy of the Department ofDefense is to make the maximum amount of information available to the publicconsistent with its other responsibilities, written requests for a DoDrecord made under the FOIA may be denied only when: (i) The record is subject to one or more of the exemptions in subpart Cof this part and the Government's interest will be jeopardized by its release.(ii) The record has not been described well enough to enable the DoD Componentto locate it with a reasonable amount of effort by an employee familiarwith the files. (iii) The requester has failed to comply with the procedural requirements,including the written agreement to pay or payment of any required fee imposedby the instructions of the DoD Component concerned. When personally identifiableinformation in a record is requested by the subject of the record or hisattorney, notarization of the request may be required. (2) Individuals seeking DoD information should address their FOI requeststo one of the addresses listed in Appendix B of this part. (b) <T3>Requests from private parties.</T3> The provisions of the FOIA arereserved for persons with private interests as opposed to federal or foreigngovernments seeking information. Requests from private persons will bemade in writing, and will clearly show all other addressees within theFederal Government to whom the request was also sent. This procedure willreduce processing time requirements, and ensure better inter and intra-agencycoordination. Components are under no obligation to establish proceduresto receive hand delivered requests. Foreign governments seeking informationfrom DoD Components should use established official channels for obtaininginformation. Release of records to individuals under the FOIA is consideredpublic release of information, except as provided for in paragraph (c)of this section. (c) <T3>Requests from Government officials.</T3> Requests from officials ofState, or local Governments for DoD Component records shall be honoredon an expeditious basis whenever possible. For purposes of determiningwhether the record or records shall be provided, such officials actingin an individual capacity shall be considered the same as any other requester.(d) <T3>Privileged release to officials.</T3> (1) Subject to DoD 5200.1-R,applicable to classified information, DoD Directive 5400.11, applicableto personal privacy, or other applicable law, records exempt from releaseunder Chapter III of this Regulation may be authenticated and released,in accordance with DoD Component regulations, to officials requesting themon behalf of local, State or Federal governmental bodies, whether legislative,executive, administrative, or judicial, as follows: (i) To Congress, in accordance with DoD Directive 5400.4. (ii) To the Federal courts, whenever ordered by officers of the court asnecessary for the proper administration of justice. (iii) To other Federal Agencies, both executive and administrative, asdetermined by the head of a DoD Component or designee. (iv) To State and local officials, as determined by the head of a DoD Componentor designee. (2) DoD Components shall inform officials receiving records under the provisionsof paragraph (d)(1) of this section that those records are exempt frompublic release under the FOIA and are privileged. DoD Components also shalladvise officials of any special handling instructions. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 286.29</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Initial determinations. </ITAG>(a) <T3>Initial denial authority.</T3> (1) Components shall limit the numberof IDAs appointed. In designating its IDAs, a DoD Component shall balancethe goals of centralization of authority to promote uniform decisions anddecentralization to facilitate responding to each request within the timelimitations of the FOIA. (2) The initial determination of whether to make a record available uponrequest may be made by any suitable official designated by the DoD Componentin published regulations. The presence of the marking ``For Official UseOnly'' does not relieve the designated official of the responsibility toreview the requested record for the purpose of determining whether an exemptionunder this part is applicable and should be invoked. (3) The officials designated by DoD Components to make initial determinationsshould consult with public affairs officers (PAOs) to become familiar withsubject matter that is considered to be newsworthy, and advise PAOs ofall requests from news media representatives. In addition, the officialsshould inform PAOs in advance when they intend to withhold or partiallywithhold a record, if it appears that the withholding action may be challengedin the media. (b) <T3>Reasons for not releasing a record.</T3> There are seven reasons fornot complying with a request for a record: (1) The request is transferred to another DoD Component, or to anotherfederal agency. (2) The request is withdrawn by the requester. (3) The information requested is not a record within the meaning of theFOIA and this part.(4) A record has not been described with sufficient particularity to enablethe DoD Component to locate it by conducting a reasonable search. (5) The requester has failed unreasonably to comply with procedural requirements,including payment of fees, imposed by this part or DoD Component supplementingregulations. (6) The DoD Component determines through knowledge of its files and reasonablesearch efforts that it neither controls nor otherwise possesses the requestedrecord. (A ``no record'' determination is not considered a denial; thereforean appeal is not appropriate). (7) The record is denied in accordance with procedures set forth in theFOIA and this part. (c) <T3>Denial tests. </T3>To deny a requested record that is in the possessionor control of a DoD Component, it must be determined that the denial meetsthe following tests: (1) The record is included in one or more of the nine categories of recordsexempt from mandatory disclosure as provided by the FOIA and outlined inSubpart C of this part. (2) The use of its discretionary authority is deemed unwarranted. (d) <T3>Reasonably segregable portions.</T3> Although portions of some recordsmay be denied, the remaining reasonably segregable portions must be releasedto the requester when it reasonably can be assumed that a skillful andknowledgeable person could not reconstruct the excised information. Whena record is denied in whole, the response advising the requester of thatdetermination will specifically state that it is not reasonable to segregateportions of the record for release. (e) <T3>Response to requester.</T3> (1) Initial determinations to release ordeny a record normally shall be made and the decision reported to the requesterwithin 10 working days after receipt of the request by the official designatedto respond. (2) When a decision is made to release a record, a copy should be madeavailable promptly to the requester once he has complied with preliminaryprocedural requirements. (3) When a request for a record is denied in whole or in part, the officialdesignated to respond shall inform the requester in writing of the nameand title or position of the official who made the determination, and shallexplain to the requester the basis for the determination in sufficientdetail to permit the requester to make a decision concerning appeal. Therequester specifically shall be informed of the exemptions on which thedenial is based. When the initial denial is based in whole or in part ona security classification, the explanation should include a summary ofthe applicable criteria for classification, as well as an explanation,to the extent reasonably feasible, of how those criteria apply to the particularrecord in question. The requester shall also be advised of the opportunityand procedures for appealing an unfavorable determination to a higher finalauthority within the DoD Component. (4) The response to the requester should contain information concerningthe fee status of the request, consistent the provisions of Subpart F thispart. (5) The explanation of the substantive basis for a denial shall includespecific citation of the statutory exemption applied under provisions ofthis part. Merely referring to a classification or to a ``For OfficialUse Only'' marking on the requested record does not constitute a propercitation or explanation of the basis for invoking an exemption. (6) When the time for response becomes an issue, the official responsiblefor replying shall acknowledge to the requester the date of the receiptof the request. (f) <T3>Extension of time.</T3> (1) In unusual circumstances, when additionaltime is needed to respond, the DoD Component shall acknowledge the requestin writing within the 10-day period, describe the circumstances requiringthe delay, and indicate the anticipated date for substantive response thatmay not exceed 10 additional working days. Unusual circumstances that mayjustify delay are: (i) The requested record is located in whole or in part at places otherthan the office processing the request. (ii) The request requires the collection and evaluation of a substantialnumber of records. (iii) Consultation is required with other DoD Components or agencies havingsubstantial interest in the subject matter to determine whether the recordsrequested are exempt from disclosure in whole or in part under provisionsof this part or should be released as a matter of discretion. (2) The statutory extension of time for responding to an initial requestmust be approved on a case-by-case basis by the final appellate authorityfor the DoD Component, or in accordance with regulations of the DoD Component,or in accordance with regulations of the DoD Component that establish guidancegoverning the circumstances in which such extensions may be granted. (3) In these unusual cases where the statutory time limits cannot be metand no informal extension of time has been agreed to, the inability toprocess any part of the request within the specified time should be explainedto the requester with a request that he agree to await a substantive responseby an anticipated date. It should be made clear that any such agreementdoes not prejudice the right of the requester to appeal the initial decisionafter it is made. Components are reminded that the requester still retainsthe right to treat this delay as a defacto denial with full adminstrativeremedies. (4) As an alternative to the taking of formal extensions of time as describedin paragraphs (f) (1), (2), and (3) of this section, the negotiation bythe cognizant FOIA coordinating office of informal extensions in time withrequesters is encouraged where appropriate. (g) <T3>Misdirected requests.</T3> Misdirected requests shall be forwardedpromptly to the DoD Component with the responsibility for the records requested.The period allowed for responding to the request misdirected by the requestershall not begin until the request is received by the DoD Component thatmanagers the records requested. (h) <T3>Records of non-U.S. Government source.</T3> (1) When a request is receivedfor a record that was obtained from a non-U.S. Government source, or fora record containing information clearly identified as having been providedby a non-U.S. Government source, the source of tbe record or information(also known as ``the submitter'' for matters pertaining to proprietarydata under 5 U.S.C. 552, Exemption (b)(4)) (subpart C, andSection; 286.15(a)(4),this part and E.O. 12600), shall be notified promptly of that request andafforded reasonable time (e.g. 30 calendar days) to present any objectionsconcerning the release, unless it is clear that there can be no valid basisfor objection. This practice is required for those FOIA requests for datanot deemed clearly exempt from disclosure under Exemption (b)(4). If, forexample, the record or information was provided with actual or presumptiveknowledge of the non-U.S. Government source and established that it wouldbe made available to the public upon request, there is no obligation tonotify the source. Any objections shall be evaluated. The final decisionto disclose information claimed to be exempt under Exemption (b)(4) shallbe made by an official equivalent in rank to the official who would makethe decision to  withhold that information under the FOIA. When a substantialissue has been raised, the DoD Component may seek additional informationfrom the source of the information and afford the source and requesterreasonable opportunities to present their arguments on the legal and substantiveissues involved prior to making an agency determination. When the sourceadvises it will seek a restraining order or take court action to preventrelease of the record or information, the requester shall be notified,and action on the request normally shall not be taken until after the outcomeof that court action is known. When the requester brings court action tocompel disclosure, the submitter shall be promptly notified of this action.(2) The coordination provisions of this paragraph apply to any non-U.S.Government record in the possession and control of the Department of Defensefrom multi-national organizations, such as North Atlantic Treaty Organization(NATO) and North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), or foreigngovernments. Coordination with foreign governments under the provisionsof this paragraph shall be made through Department of State. (i) <T3>File of initial denials.</T3> Copies of all initial denials shall bemaintained by each DoD Component in a form suitable for rapid retrieval,periodic statistical compilation, and management evaluation. (j) <T3>Special mail services.</T3> Components are authorized to use registeredmail, certified mail, certificates of mailing and return receipts. However,their use should be limited to instances where it appears advisable toestablish proof of dispatch or receipt of FOIA correspondence.(k) <T3>Receipt accounts. </T3>The Treasurer of the United States has establishedtwo accounts for FOIA receipts. These accounts, which are described below,shall be used for depositing all FOIA receipts, except receipts for industrially-fundedand non-appropriated funded activities. Components are reminded that thebelow account numbers must be preceeded by the appropriate disbursing officetwo digit prefix. Industrially-funded and nonappropriated funded activityFOIA receipts shall be deposited to the applicable fund. (1) <T3>Receipt Account 3210 Sale of Publications and Reproductions, Freedomof Information Act. </T3>This account shall be used when depositing fundsreceived from providing existing publications and forms that meet the ReceiptAccount Series description found in Federal Account Symbols and Titles.(2) <T3>Receipt Account 3210 Fees and Other Charges for Services, Freedom ofInformation Act. </T3>This account is used to deposit search fees, feesfor duplicating and reviewing (in the case of commercial requesters) recordsto satisfy requests that could not be filled with existing publicationsor forms. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 286.31 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Appeals. </ITAG>(a) <T3>General. </T3>If the official designated by the DoD Component to makeinitial determinations on requests for records declines to provide a recordbecause the official considers it exempt, that decision may be appealedby the requester, in writing, to a designated appellate authority. Theappeal should be accompanied by a copy of the letter denying the initialrequest. Such appeals should contain the basis for disagreement with theinitial refusal. Appeal procedures also apply to the disapproval of a requestfor waiver or reduction of fees. A ``no record'' finding may not be appealed,although the requester may ask the agency to search other files or providemore detailed identification to facilitate another search of the files.(b) <T3>Time of receipt. </T3>An FOI appeal has been received by a DoD Componentwhen it reaches the office of an appellate authority having jurisdiction.Misdirected appeals should be referred expeditiously to the proper appellateauthority. (c) <T3>Time limits. </T3>(1) The requester should be advised to file an appealso that it reaches the appellate authority no later than 60 calendar daysafter the date of the initial denial letter. At the conclusion of thisperiod, the case may be considered closed; however, such closure does notpreclude the requester from filing litigation. In cases where the requesteris provided several incremental determinations for a single request, thetime for the appeal shall not begin until the requester receives the lastsuch notification. Records which are denied shall be retained during thetime permitted for appeal. (2) Final determinations on appeals normally shall be made within 20 workingdays after receipt. (d) <T3>Delay in responding to an appeal. </T3>(1) If additional time is neededdue to the unusual circumstances described in andSection; 286.29(f) the finaldecision may be delayed for the number of working days (not to exceed 10),that were not used as additional time for responding to the initial request.(2) If a determination cannot be made and the requester notified within20 working days, the appellate authority shall acknowledge to the requester,in writing, the date of receipt of the appeal, the circumstances surroundingthe delay, and the anticipated date for substantive response. Requestersshall be advised that, if the delay exceeds the statutory extension provisionor is for reasons other than the unusual circumstances identified in andSection;286.29(f) they may consider their administrative remedies exhausted. Theymay, however, without prejudicing their right of judicial remedy, awaita substantive response. The DoD Component shall continue to process thecase expeditiously, whether or not the requester seeks a court order forrelease of the records, but a copy of any response provided subsequentto filing of a complaint shall be forwarded to the Department of Justice.(e) <T3>Response to the requester. </T3>(1) When an appellate authority makesa determination to release all or a portion of records withheld by an IDA,a copy of the records so released should be forwarded promptly to the requesterafter compliance with any preliminary procedural requirements, such aspayment of fees. (2) Final refusal to provide a requested record or to approve a requestfor waiver or reduction of fees must be made in writing by the head ofthe DoD Component or by a designated representative. The response, at aminimum, shall include the following: (i) The basis for the refusal shall be explained to the requester, in writing,both with regard to the applicable statutory exemption or exemptions invokedunder provisions of this part. (ii) When the final refusal is based in whole or in part on a securityclassification, the explanation shall include a determination that therecord meets the cited criteria and rationale of the governing ExecutiveOrder, and that this determination is based on a declassification review,with the explanation of how that review confirmed the continuing validityof the security classification. (iii) The final denial shall include the name and title or position ofthe official responsible for the denial. (iv) The response shall advise the requester that the material being denieddoes not contain meaningful portions that are reasonably segregable. (v) The response shall advise the requester of the right to judicial review.(f) <T3>Consultation. </T3>(1) Final refusal, involving issues not previouslyresolved or that the DoD Component knows to be inconsistent with rulingsof other DoD Components, ordinarily should not be made before consultationwith the Office of the General Counsel of the Department of Defense. (2) Tentative decisions to deny records that raise new or significant legalissues of potential significance to other agencies of the Government shallbe provided to the Department of Justice, ATTN: Office of Legal Policy,Office of Information and Policy, Washington, DC 20530. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 286.33 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Judicial actions. </ITAG>(a) <T3>General. </T3>(1) This section states current legal and proceduralrules for the convenience of the reader. The statements of rules do notcreate rights or remedies not otherwise available, nor do they bind theDepartment of Defense to particular judicial interpretations or procedures.(2) A requester may seek an order from a United States District Court tocompel release of a record after administrative remedies have been exhausted;i.e., when refused a record by the head of a Component or an appellatedesignee or when the DoD Component has failed to respond within the timelimits prescribed by the FOIA and in this part. (b) <T3>Jurisdiction. </T3>The requester may bring suit in the United StatesDistrict Court in the district in which the requester resides or is therequester's place of business, in the district in which the record is located,or in the District of Columbia. (c) <T3>Burden of proof. </T3>The burden of proof is on the DoD Component tojustify its refusal to provide a record. The court shall evaluate the casede novo (anew) and may elect to examine any requested record in camera(in private) to determine whether the denial was justified. (d) <T3>Actions by the court. </T3>(1) When a DoD Component has failed to makea determination within the statutory time limits but can demonstrate duediligence in exceptional circumstances, the court may retain jurisdictionand allow the Component additional time to complete its review of the records.(2) If the court determines that the requester's complaint is substantiallycorrect, it may require the United States to pay reasonable attorney feesand other litigation costs. (3) When the court orders the release of denied records, it may also issuea written finding that the circumstances surrounding the withholding raisequestions whether DoD Component personnel acted arbitrarily and capriciously.In these cases, the special counsel of the Merit System Protection Boardshall conduct an investigation to determine whether or not disciplinaryaction is warranted. The DoD Component is obligated to take the actionrecommended by the special counsel. (4) The court may punish the responsible official for contempt when a DoDComponent fails to comply with the court order to produce records thatit determines have been withheld improperly.  (e) <T3>Non-United States Government source information. </T3>A requester maybring suit in a U.S. District Court to compel the release of records obtainedfrom a nongovernment source or records based on information obtained froma nongovernment source. Such source shall be notified promptly of the courtaction. When the source advises that it is seeking court action to preventrelease, the DoD Component shall defer answering or otherwise pleadingto the complainant as long as permitted by the Court or until a decisionis rendered in the court action of the source, whichever is sooner. (f) <T3>Litigation status sheet. </T3>FOIA managers at DoD Component levelshall be aware of litigation under the FOIA. Such information will providemanagement insights into the use of the nine exemptions by Component personnel.The Litigation Status Sheet at Appendix C of this part provides a standardformat for recording information concerning FOIA litigation and forwardingthat information to the Office of the Secretary of Defense. Whenever acomplaint under the FOIA is filed in a U.S. District Court, the DoD Componentnamed in the complaint shall forward a Litigation Status Sheet, with itemsl through 6 completed, and a copy of the complaint to the OASD(PA), ATTN:DFOISR, with an information copy to the General Counsel, Department ofDefense, ATTN: Office of Legal Counsel. A revised Litigation Status Sheetshall be provided at each stage of the litigation.<ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart F_Fee Schedule </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 286.35 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">General provisions. </ITAG>(a) <T3>Authorities. </T3>The Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), asamended; by the Freedom of Information Reform Act of 1986; the PaperworkReduction Act (44 U.S.C. 35); the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a);the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 (31 U.S.C. 1 et. seq.); the Budgetand Accounting Procedures Act (31 U.S.C. 67 et. seq.); the Defense AuthorizationAct for FY 87, section 954 (Pub. L. 99-661), as amended by the DefenseTechnical Corrections Act of 1987 (Pub. L. 100-26). (b) <T3>Application. </T3>(1) The fees described in this Subpart apply to FOIArequests, and conform to the Office of Management and Budget Uniform Freedomof Information Act Fee Schedule and Guidelines. They reflect direct costsfor search, review (in the case of commercial requesters), and duplicationof documents, collection of which is permitted by the FOIA. They are neitherintended to imply that fees must be charged in connection with providinginformation to the public in the routine course of business, nor are theymeant as a substitute for any other schedule of fees, such as DoD Instruction7230.7 \10\<NOTE/> (32 CFR Part 288) which does not supersede the collectionof fees under the FOIA. Nothing in this Subpart shall supersede fees chargeableunder a statute specifically providing for setting the level of fees forparticular types of records. A ``statute specifically providing for settingthe level of fees for particular types of records'' (5 U.S.C. 552 (a)(4)(A)(vi))means any statute that enables a Government Agency such as the GovernmentPrinting Office (GPO) or the National Technical Information Service (NTIS),to set and collect fees. Components   should ensure that when documentsthat would be responsive to a request are maintained for distribution byagencies operating statutory-based fee schedule programs such as the GPOor NTIS, they inform requesters of the steps necessary to obtain recordsfrom those sources.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ See footnote 1 to andSection; 286.1(a) (2) The term ``direct costs'' means those expenditures a Component actuallymakes in searching for, reviewing (in the case of commercial requesters),and duplicating documents to respond to an FOIA request. Direct costs include,for example, the salary of the employee performing the work (the basicrate of pay for the employee plus 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits),and the costs of operating duplicating machinery. These factors have beenincluded in the fee rates prescribed at andSection; 286.37. Not includedin direct costs are overhead expenses such as costs of space, heating orlighting the facility in which the records are stored. (3) The term ``search'' includes all time spent looking for material thatis responsive to a request. Search also includes a page-by-page or line-by-lineidentification (if necessary) of material in the document to determineif it, or portions thereof are responsive to the request. Components shouldensure that searches are done in the most efficient and least expensivemanner so as to minimize costs for both the Component and the requester.For example, Components should not engage in line-by-line searches whenduplicating an entire document known to contain responsive informationwould prove to be the less expensive and quicker method of complying withthe request. Time spent reviewing documents in order to determine whetherto apply one or more of the statutory exemptions is not search time, butreview time. See paragraph (b)(5) of this section for the definition ofreview, and andSection; 286.37(b)(2) for information pertaining to computersearches. (4) The term ``duplication'' refers to the process of making a copy ofa document in response to an FOIA request. Such copies can take the formof  paper copy, microfiche, audiovisual, or machine readable documentation(e.g., magnetic tape or disc), among others. Every effort will be madeto ensure that the copy provided is in a form that is reasonably useableby requesters. If it is not possible to provide copies which are clearlyuseable, the requester shall be notified that their copy is the best availableand that the agency's master copy shall be made available for review uponappointment. For duplication of computer tapes and audiovisual, the actualcost, including the operator's time, shall be charged. In practice, ifa Component estimates that assessable duplication charges are likely toexceed $25.00, it shall notify the requester of the estimate, unless therequester has indicated in advance his or her willingness to pay fees ashigh as those anticipated. Such a notice shall offer a requester the opportunityto confer with Component personnel with the object of reformulating therequest to meet his or her needs at a lower cost. (5) The term ``review'' refers to the process of examining documents locatedin response to an FOIA request to determine whether one or more of thestatutory exemptions permit withholding. It also includes processing thedocuments for disclosure, such as excising them for release. Review doesnot include the time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regardingthe application of exemptions. It should be noted that charges for commercialrequesters may be assessed only for the initial review. Components maynot charge for reviews required at the administrative appeal level of anexemption already applied. However, records or portions of records withheldin full under an exemption which is subsequently determined not to applymay be reviewed again to determine the applicability of other exemptionsnot previously considered. The costs for such a subsequent review wouldbe properly assessable. (c) <T3>Fee restrictions. </T3>(1) No fees may be charged by any DoD Componentif the costs of routine collection and processing of the fee are likelyto equal or exceed the amount  of the fee. With the exception of requestersseeking documents for a commercial use, Components shall provide the firsttwo hours of search time, and the first one hundred pages of duplicationwithout charge. For example, for a request (other than one from a commercialrequester) that involved two hours and ten minutes of search time, andresulted in one hundred and five pages of documents, a Component woulddetermine the cost of only ten minutes of search time, and only five pagesof reproduction. If this processing cost was equal to, or less than thecost to the Component for billing the requester and processing the feecollected, no charges would result. (2) Requesters receiving the first two hours of search and the first onehundred pages of duplication without charge are entitled to such only onceper request. Consequently, if a Component, after completing its portionof a request, finds it necessary to refer the request to a subordinateoffice, another DoD Component, or another Federal Agency to action theirportion of the request, the referring Component shall inform the recipientof the referral of the expended amount of search time and duplication costto date. (3) The elements to be considered in determining the ``cost of collectinga fee'' are the administrative costs to the Component of receiving andrecording a remittance, and processing the fee for deposit in the Departmentof Treasury's special account. The cost to the Department of Treasury tohandle such remittance is negligible and shall not be considered in Components'determinations. (4) For the purposes of these restrictions, the word ``pages'' refers topaper copies of a standard size, which will normally be ``8\1/2\ x 11''or ``11 x 14''. Thus, requesters would not be entitled to 100 microficheor 100 computer disks, for example. A microfiche containing the equivalentof 100 pages or 100 pages of computer printout; however, might meet theterms of the restriction. (5) In the case of computer searches, the first two free hours will bedetermined against the salary scale of the individual operating the computerfor the purposes of the search. As an example, when the direct costs ofthe computer central processing unit, input-output devices, and memorycapacity equal $24.00 (two hours of equivalent search at the clerical level),amounts of computer costs in excess of that amount are chargeable as computersearch time. (d) <T3>Fee waivers. </T3>(1) Documents shall be furnished without charge,or at a charge reduced below fees assessed to the categories of requestersin paragraph (e) of this section when the Component determines that waiveror reduction of the fees is in the public interest because furnishing theinformation is likely to contribute significantly to public understandingof the operations or activities of the Department of Defense and is notprimarily in the commercial interest of the requester. (2) When assessable costs for an FOIA request total $15.00 or less, feesshall be waived automatically for all requesters, regardless of category.(3) Decisions to waive or reduce fees that exceed the automatic waiverthreshold shall be made on a case-by-case basis, consistent with the followingfactors: (i) Disclosure of the information ``is in the public interest because itis likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operationsor activities of the Government.'' (A) <T3>The subject of the request. </T3>Components should analyze whetherthe subject matter of the request involves issues which will significantlycontribute to the public understanding of the operations or activitiesof the Department of Defense. Requests for records in the possession ofthe Department of Defense which were originated by non-government organizationsand are sought for their intrinsic content, rather than informative valuewill likely not contribute to public understanding of the operations oractivities  of the Department of Defense. An example of such records mightbe press clippings, magazine articles, or records forwarding a particularopinion or concern from a member of the public regarding a DoD activity.Similarly, disclosures of records of considerable age may or may not beardirectly on the current activities of the Department of Defense; however,the age of a particular record shall not be the sole criteria for denyingrelative significance under this factor. It is possible to envisage aninformative issue concerning the current activities of the Department ofDefense, based upon historical documentation. Requests of this nature mustbe closely reviewed consistent with the requester's stated purpose fordesiring the records and the potential for public understanding of theoperations and activities of the Department of Defense. (B) <T3>The informative value of the information to be disclosed. </T3>Thisfactor requires a close analysis of the substantive contents of a record,or portion of the record, to determine whether disclosure is meaningful,and shall inform the public on the operations or activities of the Departmentof Defense. While the subject of a request may contain information whichconcerns operations or activities of the Department of Defense, it maynot always hold great potential for contributing to a meaningful understandingof these operations or activities. An example of such would be a heavilyredacted record, the balance of which may contain only random words, fragmentedsentences, or paragraph headings. A determination as to whether a recordin this situation will contribute to the public understanding of the operationsor activities of the Department of Defense must be approached with caution,and carefully weighed against the arguments offered by the requester. Anotherexample is information already known to be in the public domain. Disclosureof duplicative, or nearly identical information already existing in thepublic domain may add no meaningful new information concerning the operationsand activities of the Department of Defense. (C) <T3>The contribution to an understanding of the subject by the generalpublic likely to result from disclosure. </T3>The key element in determiningthe applicability of this factor is whether disclosure will inform, orhave the potential to inform the public, rather than simply the individualrequester or small segment of interested persons. The identity of the requesteris essential in this situation in order to determine whether such requesterhas the capability and intention to disseminate the information to thepublic. Mere assertions of plans to author a book, researching a particularsubject, doing doctoral dissertion work, or indigency are insufficientwithout demonstrating the capacity to further disclose the informationin a manner which will be informative to the general public. Requestersshould be asked to describe their qualifications, the nature of their research,the purpose of the requested information, and their intended means of disseminationto the public. (D) <T3>The significance of the contribution to public understanding. </T3>Inapplying this factor, Components must differentiate the relative significanceor impact of the disclosure against the current level of public knowledge,or understanding which exists before the disclosure. In other words, willdisclosure on a current subject of wide public interest be unique in contributingpreviously unknown facts, thereby enhancing public knowledge, or will itbasically duplicate what is already known by the general public. A decisionregarding significance requires objective judgment, rather than subjectivedetermination, and must be applied carefully to determine whether disclosurewill likely lead to a significant public understanding of the issue. Componentsshall not make value judgments as to whether the information is importantenough to be made public.  (ii) Disclosure of the information ``is not primarily in the commercialinterest of the requester.'' (A) <T3>The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest.</T3> If the requestis determined to be of a commercial interest, Components should addressthe magnitude of that interest to determine if the requester's commercialinterest is primary, as opposed to any secondary personal or non-commercialinterest. In addition to profit-making organizations, individual personsor other organizations may have a commercial interest in obtaining certainrecords. Where it is difficult to determine whether the requester is ofa commercial nature, Components may draw inference from the requester'sidentity and circumstances of the request. In such situations, the provisionsof paragraph (e) of this section, apply. Components are reminded that inorder to apply the commercial standards of the FOIA, the requester's commercialbenefit must clearly override any personal or non-profit interest. (B) <T3>The primary interest in disclosure.</T3> Once a requester's commercialinterest has been determined, Components should then determine if the disclosurewould be primarily in that interest. This requires a balancing test betweenthe commercial interest of the request against any public benefit to bederived as a result of that disclosure. Where the public interest is servedabove and beyond that of the requester's commercial interest, a waiveror reduction of fees would be appropriate. Conversely, even if a significantpublic interest exists, and the relative commercial interest of the requesteris determined to be greater than the public interest, then a waiver orreduction of fees would be inappropriate. As examples, news media organizationshave a commercial interest as business organizations; however, their inherentrole of disseminating news to the general public can ordinarily be presumedto be of a primary interest. Therefore, any commercial interest becomessecondary to the primary interest in serving the public. Similarly, scholarswriting books or engaged in other forms of academic research, may recognizea commercial benefit, either directly, or indirectly (through the institutionthey represent); however, normally such pursuits are primarily undertakenfor educational purposes, and the application of a fee charge would beinappropriate. Conversely, data brokers or others who merely compile governmentinformation for marketing can normally be presumed to have an interestprimarily of a commercial nature. (4) Components are reminded that the above factors and examples are notall inclusive. Each fee decision must be considered on a case-by-case basisand upon the merits of the information provided in each request. When theelement of doubt as to whether to charge or waive the fee cannot be clearlyresolved, Components should rule in favor of the requester. (5) In addition, the following additional circumstances describe situationswhere waiver or reduction of fees are most likely to be warranted: (i) A record is voluntarily created to preclude an otherwise burdensomeeffort to provide voluminous amounts of available records, including additionalinformation not requested. (ii) A previous denial of records is reversed in total, or in part, andthe assessable costs are not substantial (e.g. $15.00-$30.00). (e) <T3>Fee assessment.</T3> (1) Fees may not be used to discourage requesters,and to this end, FOIA fees are limited to standard charges for direct documentsearch, review (in the case of commercial requesters) and duplication.(2) In order to be as responsive as possible to FOIA requests while minimizingunwarranted costs to the taxpayer, Components shall adhere to the followingprocedures: (i) Analyze each request to determine the category of the requester. Ifthe Component determination regarding the category of the requester isdifferent than that claimed by the requester, the Component shall: (A) Notify the requester that he should provide additional justificationto warrant the category claimed, and that a search for responsive recordswill not be initiated until agreement has been attained relative to thecategory of the requester. Absent further category justification from therequester, and within a reasonable period of time (i.e., 30 calendar days),the Component shall render a final category determination, and notify therequester of such determination, to include normal administrative appealrights of the determination. (B) Advise the requester that, notwithstanding any appeal, a search forresponsive records will not be initiated until the requester indicatesa willingness to pay assessable costs appropriate for the category determinedby the Component. (ii) Requesters must submit a fee declaration appropriate for the belowcategories. (A) <T3>Commercial.</T3> Requesters must indicate a willingness to pay allsearch, review and duplication costs. (B) <T3>Educational or noncommercial scientific institution or news media.</T3>Requesters must indicate a willingness to pay duplication charges in excessof 100 pages if more than 100 pages of records are desired. (C) <T3>All others.</T3> Requesters must indicate a willingness to pay assessablesearch and duplication costs if more than two hours of search effort or100 pages of records are desired. (iii) If the previous conditions are not met, then the request need notbe processed and the requester shall be so informed. (iv) In the situations described by paragraphs (e)(2) (i) and (ii), Componentsmust be prepared to provide an estimate of assessable fees if desired bythe requester. While it is recognized that search situations will varyamong Components, and that an estimate is often difficult to obtain priorto an actual search, requesters who desire estimates are entitled to suchbefore committing to a willingness to pay. Should Component estimates exceedthe actual amount of the estimate or the amount agreed to by the requester,the amount in excess of the estimate or the requester's agreed amount shallnot be charged without the requester's agreement. (v) No DoD Component may require advance payment of any fee; i.e., paymentbefore work is commenced or continued on a request, unless the requesterhas previously failed to pay fees in a timely fashion, or the agency hasdetermined that the fee will exceed $250.00. As used in this sense, a timelyfashion is 30 calendar days from the date of billing (the fees have beenassessed in writing) by the Component. (vi) Where a Component estimates or determines that allowable charges thata requester may be required to pay are likely to exceed $250.00, the Componentshall notify the requester of the likely cost and obtain satisfactory assuranceof full payment where the requester has a history of prompt payments, orrequire an advance payment of an amount up to the full estimated chargesin the case of requesters with no history of payment. (vii) Where a requester has previously failed to pay a fee charged in atimely fashion (i.e., within 30 calendar days from the date of the billing),the Component may require the requester to pay the full amount owed, plusany applicable interest, or demonstrate that he or she has paid the fee,and to make an advance payment of the full amount of the estimated feebefore the Component begins to process a new or pending request from therequester. Interest will be at the rate prescribed in 31 U.S.C. 3717 andconfirmed with respective Finance and Accounting Offices. (viii) After all work is completed on a request, and the documents areready for release, Components may request payment before forwarding thedocuments if there is no payment history on the requester, or if the requesterhas previously failed to pay a fee in a timely fashion (i.e., within 30calendar days from the date of the billing). In the case of the latter,the provisions of paragraph (e)(2)(vii) of this section apply. Componentsmay not hold documents ready for release pending payment from requesterswith a history of prompt payment. (ix) When Components act under paragraphs (e)(2) (i) through (vii) of thissection, the administrative time limits of the FOIA (i.e., 10 working daysfrom receipt of initial requests, and 20 working days from receipt of appeals,plus permissible extensions of these time limits) will begin only afterthe Component has received a willingness to pay fees and satisfaction asto category determination, or fee payments (if appropriate). (x) Components may charge for time spent searching for records, even ifthat search fails to locate records responsive to the request, or if recordslocated are determined to be exempt from disclosure. In practice, if theComponent estimates that search charges are likely to exceed $25.00 itshall notify the requester of the estimated amount of fees, unless therequester has indicated in advance his or her willingness to pay fees ashigh as those anticipated. Such a notice shall offer the requester theopportunity to confer with Component personnel with the object of reformulatingthe request to meet his or her needs at a lower cost. (3) <T3>Commercial requesters. </T3>Fees shall be limited to reasonable standardcharges for document search, review and duplication when records are requestedfor commercial use. Requesters must reasonably describe the records sought(see andSection; 286.7(h)). (i) The term ``commercial use'' request refers to a request from, or onbehalf of one who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthersthe commercial, trade, or profit interest of the requester or the personon whose behalf the request is made. In determining whether a requesterproperly belongs in this category, Components must determine the use towhich a requester will put the documents requested. Moreover, where a Componenthas reasonable cause to doubt the use to which a requester will put therecords sought, or where that use is not clear from the request itself,Components should seek additional clarification before assigning the requestto a specific category. (ii) When Components receive a request for documents for commercial use,they should assess charges which recover the full direct costs of searchingfor, reviewing for release, and duplicating the records sought. Commercialrequesters (unlike other requesters) are not entitled to two hours of freesearch time, nor 100 free pages of reproduction of documents. Moreover,commercial requesters are not normally entitled to a waiver or reductionof fees based upon an assertion that disclosure would be in the publicinterest. However, because use is the exclusive determining criteria, itis possible to envision a commercial enterprise making a request that isnot for commercial use. It is also possible that a non-profit organizationcould make a request that is for commercial use. Such situations must beaddressed on a case-by-case basis. (4) <T3>Educational institution requesters. </T3>Fees shall be limited to onlyreasonable standard charges for document duplication (excluding chargesfor the first 100 pages) when the request is made by an educational institutionwhose purpose is scholarly research. Requesters must reasonably describethe records sought (see andSection; 286.7(h)). The term ``educational institution''refers to a pre-school, a public or private elementary or secondary school,an institution of graduate higher education, an institution of undergraduatehigher education, an institution of professional education, and an institutionof vocational education, which operates a program or programs of scholarlyresearch. (5) <T3>Non-commercial scientific institution requesters. </T3>Fees shall belimited to only reasonable standard charges for document duplication (excludingcharges for the first 100 pages) when the request is made by a non-commercialscientific institution whose purpose is scientific research. Requestersmust reasonably describe the records sought (see andSection; 286.7(h)). Theterm ``noncommercial scientific institution'' refers to an institutionthat is not operated on a ``commercial'' basis as defined in paragraph(e)(3) of this section and which is operated solely for the purpose ofconducting scientific research, the results of which are not intended topromote any particular product or industry. (6) Components shall provide documents to requesters in paragraphs (e)(4)and (5) of this section for the cost of duplication alone, excluding chargesfor the first 100 pages. To be eligible for inclusion in these categories,requesters must show that the request is being made under the auspicesof a qualifying institution and that the records are not sought for commercialuse, but in furtherance of scholarly (from an educational institution)or scientific (from a non-commercial scientific institution) research.(7) <T3>Representatives of the news media. </T3>Fees shall be limited to onlyreasonable standard charges for document duplication (excluding chargesfor the first 100 pages) when the request is made by a representative ofthe news media. Requesters must reasonably describe the records sought(see andSection; 286.7 (h)). (i) The term ``representative of the news media'' refers to any personactively gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated topublish or broadcast news to the public. The term ``news'' means informationthat is about current events or that would be of current interest to thepublic. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stationsbroadcasting to the public at large, and publishers of periodicals (butonly in those instances when they can qualify as disseminators of ``news'')who make their products available for purchase or subscription by the generalpublic. These examples are not meant to be all-inclusive. Moreover, astraditional methods of news delivery evolve (e.g., electronic disseminationof newspapers through telecommunications services), such alternative mediawould be included in this category. In the case of ``freelance'' journalists,they may be regarded as working for a news organization if they can demonstratea solid basis for expecting publication through that organization, eventhough not actually employed by it. A publication contract would be theclearest proof, but Components may also look to the past publication recordof a requester in making this determination. (ii) To be eligible for inclusion in this category, a requester must meetthe criteria in paragraph (e)(7)(i) of this section and his or her requestmust not be made for commercial use. A request for records supporting thenews dissemination function of the requester shall not be considered tobe a request that is for a commercial use. For example, a document requestby a newspaper for records relating to the investigation of a defendantin a current criminal trial of public interest could be presumed to bea request from an entity eligible for inclusion in this category, and entitledto records at the cost of reproduction alone (excluding charges for thefirst 100 pages). (8) <T3>All other requesters. </T3>Components shall charge requesters who donot fit into any of the above categories, fees which recover the full directcost of searching for and duplicating records, except that the first twohours of search time and the first 100 pages of duplication shall be furnishedwithout charge. Requesters must reasonably describe the records sought(see andSection; 286.7(h)). Requests from subjects about themselves willcontinue to be treated under the fee provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974,which permit fees only for duplication. Components are reminded that thiscategory of requester may also be eligible for a waiver or reduction offees if disclosure of the information is in the public interest as definedunder paragraph (d) of this section (see also paragraph (e)(3)(ii)). (f) <T3>Aggregating requests. </T3>Except for requests that are for a commercialuse, a Component may not charge for the first two hours of search timeor for the first 100 pages of reproduction. However, a requester may notfile multiple requests at the same time, each seeking portions of a documentor documents, solely in order to avoid payment of fees. When a Componentreasonably believes that a requester or, on rare occasions, a group ofrequesters acting in concert, is attempting to break a request down intoa series of requests for the purpose of avoiding the assessment of fees,the agency may aggregate any such requests and charge accordingly. Oneelement to be considered in determining whether a belief would be reasonableis the time period in which the requests have occurred. For example, itwould be reasonable to presume that multiple requests of this type madewithin a 30 day period had been made to avoid fees. For requests made overa longer period; however, such a presumption becomes harder to sustainand Components should have a solid basis for determining that aggregationis warranted in such cases. Components are cautioned that before aggregatingrequests from more than one requester, they must have a concrete basison which to conclude that the requesters are acting in concert and areacting specifically to avoid payment of fees. In no case may Componentsaggregate multiple requests on unrelated subjects from one requester. (g) <T3>Effect of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365). </T3>TheDebt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365) provides for a minimum annualrate of interest to be charged on overdue debts owed the Federal Government.Components may levy this interest penalty for any fees that remain outstanding30 calendar days from the date of billing (the first demand notice) tothe requester of the amount owed. The interest rate shall be as prescribedin 31 U.S.C. 3717. Components should verify the current interest rate withrespective Finance and Accounting Offices. After one demand letter hasbeen sent, and 30 calendar days have lapsed with no payment, Componentsmay submit the debt to respective Finance and Accounting Offices for collectionpursuant to the Debt Collection Act of 1982. (h) <T3>Computation of fees. </T3>The fee schedule in this Subpart shall beused to compute the search, review (in the case of commercial requesters)and duplication costs associated with processing a given FOIA request.Costs shall be computed on time actually spent. Neither time-based nordollar-based minimum charges for search, review and duplication are authorized.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 286.37 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Collection of fees and fee rates. </ITAG>(a) <T3>Collection of fees. </T3>Collection of fees will be made at the timeof providing the documents to the requester or recipient when the requesterspecifically states that the costs involved shall be acceptable or acceptableup to a specified limit that covers the anticipated costs. Collection offees may not be made in advance unless  the requester has failed to paypreviously assessed fees within 30 calendar days from the date of the billingby the DoD Component, or the Component has determined that the fee willbe in excess of $250 (see andSection; 286.35 (e)).

(g) <T3>Costs for special services. </T3>Complying with requests for specialservices is at the discretion of the Components. Neither the FOIA, norits fee structure cover these kinds of services. Therefore, Componentsmay recover the costs of special services requested by the requester afteragreement has been obtained in writing from the requester to pay for oneor more of the following services: (1) Certifying that records are true copies. (2) Sending records by special methods such as express mail, etc. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 286.39 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Collection of fees and fee rates for technical data. </ITAG>(a) <T3>Fees for technical data. </T3>(1) Technical data, other than technicaldata that discloses critical technology with military or space application,if required to be released under the FOIA, shall be released after theperson requesting such technical data pays all reasonable costs attributedto search, duplication and review of the records to be released. Technicaldata, as used in this Section, means recorded information, regardless ofthe form or method of the recording of a scientific or technical nature(including computer software documentation). This term does not includecomputer software, or data incidental to contract administration, suchas financial and/or management information. DoD Components shall retainthe amounts received by such a release, and it shall be merged with andavailable for the same purpose and the same time period as the appropriationfrom which the costs were incurred in complying with request. All reasonablecosts as used in this sense are the full costs to the Federal Governmentof rendering the service, or fair market value of the service, whicheveris higher. Fair market value shall be determined in accordance with commercialrates in the local geographical area. In the absense of a known marketvalue, charges shall be based on recovery of full costs to the FederalGovernment. The full cost shall include all direct and indirect costs toconduct the search and to duplicate the records responsive to the request.This cost is to be differentiated from the direct costs allowable underandSection; 286.37 for other types of information released under the FOIA.(2) <T3>Waiver. </T3>Components shall waive the payment of costs required inparagraph (a)(1) of this section which are greater than the costs thatwould be required for release of this same information under andSection;286.37 if: (i) The request is made by a citizen of the United States or a United Statescorporation, and such citizen or corporation certifies that the technicaldata requested is required to enable it to submit an offer, or determinewhether it is capable of submitting an offer to provide the product towhich the technical data relates to the United States or a contractor withthe United States. However, Components may require the citizen or corporationto pay a deposit in an amount equal to not more than the cost of complyingwith the request, which will be refunded upon submission of an offer bythe citizen or corporation; (ii) The release of technical data is requested in order to comply withthe terms of an international agreement; or, (iii) The Component determines in accordance with andSection; 286.35(d)(1),that such a waiver is in the interest of the United States.
