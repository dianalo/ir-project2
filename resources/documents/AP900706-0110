Unlike them, he would not be brushed aside.   He made the destitute of this city visible. He got a roof overtheir heads.   He could be a nuisance. He could exasperate the city and thecitizenry. He drove critics and allies to distraction by aninsistent demand that the homeless be accorded the respect duehumankind.   Now that he is dead, it dawned on Washington _ Washington thecommunity, not Washington the world capital _ what he meant to thiscity.   The dispossessed will have to fend for themselves. And so willthe possessed. The goad is gone. It will be up to people to see thehelpless poor without him.   By common estimate, 15,000 homeless people live on the streetsand grates of Washington.   One of Snyder's triumphs was the enactment of a 1984 law _ bythe citizens, in an initiative, over the objections of officialdom_ compelling the city to guarantee them an indoor place to spendthe night.   Of that number, 1,200 found a spot in the shelter that Snyder,in his guerrilla warfare, wrestled from Ronald Reagan in 1984.   He did that by fasting for 51 days. Snyder looked then like hewas nearly dead. CBS cameras were about to capture the showdown for``60 Minutes.'' The presidential election was two days off.   Reagan capitulated and gave Snyder's outfit, the Community forCreative Non-Violence, a tumbledown federal building a few blocksfrom the Capitol for use as a shelter and $6 million torehabilitate it.   Rep. E. Clay Shaw, R-Fla., didn't like the show boating. Hecalled Snyder ``a masochist who influences government bythreatening to starve himself.''   Snyder had a genius for attracting attention. But no one everaccused him of capitalizing on the poor. He hobnobbed withcelebrities, coming to their parties in the wrinkled clothes givento the shelter. He always needed a shave.   He held public funerals for homeless people who died on thestreets in the cold. He scavenged through dumpsters with members ofCongress. Once, he got movie stars to spend a night sleeping on thestreet. He got Cher to dish out the mashed potatoes at Christmasdinner at the shelter.   He got the Navy to alter plans to name a new nuclear submarineCorpus Christi, after the city in Texas. He said no warship shouldbear the name ``the body of Christ,'' and the Navy changed it tothe USS City of Corpus Christi. That fast lasted only 11 days.   But angry, scornful, confrontational Mitch Snyder had failures,too. He walked out of a middle-class marriage, leaving behind inNew York City two small children and forcing his wife onto welfare.He said he could not spend his life selling Electrolux vacuumcleaners and Maytag washing machines.   Eleven days ago, Snyder suffered his greatest defeat. He couldnot keep the city council from voting to gut the homeless shelterlaw or slashing spending on the destitute.   The change, awaiting Mayor Marion Barry's signature, wouldrequire homeless people to go though a screening process beforebeing approved for shelter.   Washington has accustomed itself to the sight of people sleepingon the streets. The outrage and passion have diminished.   There were suggestions that difficulties with Carol Fennelly,Snyder's companion for 15 years, led him to take his life.   In his room at the shelter where he hanged himself, Snyder leftbehind a note discussing his failed love relationship with Ms.Fennelly, police sources said. He was 46.   Maybe he was a victim of that disease of the upwardly mobile:burnout. He had been at it for 17 years.</TEXT></DOC>
