But Mrs. Aquino, in a Human Rights Day speech, blamed most abusesin the Philippines on communist rebels and dared critics to provecharges that her government pays only lip service to human rights.   Mrs. Aquino acknowledged ``sporadic'' violations of human rightsby soldiers and said that although the government does not condonesuch abuses, they are likely to continue because of the 19-yearcommunist insurgency.   ``Yet I will not accept the heat of battle as an excuse forbrutality toward the people we are pledged to protect and eventoward our enemies,'' Mrs. Aquino said. ``Democracy needs force, butthis government will not stoop to terrorism to survive.''   Mrs. Aquino, who has survived six reported coup attempts sinceshe came to power in 1986, said she had every reason to punish humanrights violators in the military because ``the hand that can abuse aprisoner will have the mind to plot a coup d'etat.''   As the president spoke, about 1,500 students demonstrated in adowntown Manila square denouncing human rights abuses which theyblamed on the ``U.S.-Aquino regime.'' The rally ended peacefully.   ``This new government has never adopted by neglect or design apolicy or pattern of human rights violations for any purpose,'' Mrs.Aquino said.   That violations will continue ``is inevitable in a country drivenby a rebellion led by fanatics,'' she said, referring to the25,000-strong communist New People's Army which has fought since1969 to set up a Marxist state.   ``If there is a conscious policy of terrorism in this country,you will find it among them,'' she added, citing killings of policeand soldiers by urban guerrillas, executions of rebels planning tosurrender and extortion of money from people in the countryside.   Mrs. Aquino said she has ordered the military to step up itscounterinsurgency ``to shorten the agony'' of her country.   The government's Commission on Human Rights said it has receivedreports of 951 cases of human rights violations since June 1986, ofwhich 578 were allegedly committed by rebels, 303 by anti-communistvigilantes and 70 by soldiers. Most of the cases filed against therebels were for insurgency-related killings.   A few hours before Mrs. Aquino's speech, a six-member delegationrepresenting various foreign human rights groups reported theresults of a 10-day fact-finding tour of the Philippines.   Laurie Wiseberg, leader of the group, composed of a Canadian,three Australians and two Americans, said they received reports thathuman rights abuses have increased since a 60-day cease-fire betweenthe government and communist rebels collapsed in February 1987.   On Friday, Mrs. Aquino ordered the Justice Department toinvestigate reported disappearances of human rights activists.   Trade union and social activist organizations have complainedthat Mrs. Aquino has failed to live up to a promise she made whenshe took power in 1986 to end human rights violations.   On Tuesday, Human Rights Watch, a New York-based civil libertiesgroup, said the Philippines leads the world in the number ofdocumented cases of violence against human rights workers.   The organization said 30 human rights workers worldwide wereslain last year, nine of them in the Philippines.</TEXT></DOC>
