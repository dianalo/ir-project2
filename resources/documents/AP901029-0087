The driver, Tim Cardwell, 28, of Marianna, Ark., told police hisfoot slipped off the brake pedal Sunday and hit the accelerator.The truck slammed into a wall of an overpass above Point StatePark.   The cab came to rest beside the wall, but the truneration of thoseborn in Cuba but raisedfor the most part in the United States. Others include pop musicstar Gloria Estefan, actor Steven Bauer, Oakland A's slugger JoseCanseco, Miami Mayor Suarez, Florida Democratic Party chairmanSimon Ferro and Marty Urra, head of the South Florida AFL-CIO.   The young Cuban-Americans sometimes call themselves ``yucas.''That stands for Young Upscale Cuban-Americans and is a takeoff onthe potato-like yucca that is a staple of Cuban diets.   They often move in and out of mainstream American life andpersonal lives that emphasize their native culture. They usuallydescribe themselves as patriotic toward both Cuba and the UnitedStates.   State Sen. Lincoln Diaz-Balart, 36, spends much of his dayspeaking English in the Legislature or his Coconut Grove law firm,but tries to speak only Spanish at home to his children, ages 5 and7.   Many afternoons find him slipping away at lunchtime to meet oneor more of his three brothers - they include a banker, a staterepresentative and the weekend anchor on a leading English-languagetelevision station - at La Hacienda restaurant for the day'sspecial, always with fried bananas and black beans over rice.   ``I never actually separated being a Cuban-American from beingAmerican,'' Diaz-Balart says. ``I was always proud of my roots,proud of Cuba. And I was always proud of the United States, theland of freedom and hope.''   Diaz-Balart's first name evinces the affinity Cubans long havehad for the United States, which intervened in the Cuba's war forindependence that exiles smilingly note is called ``theSpanish-American War'' in U.S. history.   He is eager to help rebuild a Cuba he says has been devastatedby his uncle. Castro was married to Diaz-Balart's aunt and Castro'sson, Fidelito, is a first cousin.   ``Diaz-Balart says very few Cubans would move back to Cubapermanently after three decades here. However, many will beinvolved in a post-Castro Cuba.   ``There's going to be a lot of duality,'' Suarez says, with Cubaonly 90 miles from Florida's southern tip. ``There will be peoplewith homes in both places, investments in both places ... trade,tourism. A lot of people are going to feel very comfortable herebut also want to spend part of the time there.''   Castro has vowed to maintain his system in Cuba, but excitementover his potential downfall is as high here as perhaps anytimesince before the failed U.S.-backed Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961.   Around Miami there is a new sign: ``Christmas in Cuba.''</TEXT><NOTE>END ADV</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
