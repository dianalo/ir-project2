A full-page ad bearing some 500 names, most of them professorsand other intellectuals, appeared in Tuesday's New York Times,appealing for donations for the Ad Hoc Committee in Support of theChinese Democratic Movement.   An organizer, Princeton University Professor Ying-Shih Yu, saidthe money will go toward such things as setting up a network ofcomputers, fax machines and copiers and helping the studentprotesters put out their own newspapers.   ``I think they need all kinds of money for good causes, forpushing the movement further,'' Yu said Tuesday in a telephoneinterview from Princeton, N.J.   He said more than 1,000 people, mostly intellectuals andbusinessmen, have joined the fund drive that took out the $45,000ad. ``This is mostly by American citizens, ethnic Chinese most ofthem,'' he said.   The professor said the campaign, organized at Princeton, expectsto raise about $200,000 and send it to China in cash and checkswith Chinese students and scholars returning to their homeland fromthe United States.   The money will go directly to the students to take advantage ofthe black market exchange rate, which is nearly three times theofficial rate, Yu said. Otherwise, the government will ``rob themoney out of the students' pockets.''   ``The black market is not really so black. Everyone uses it.It's kind of an open secret,'' he said.   Students in Boston, New York, San Francisco and other citiesalso have raised tens of thousands of dollars for the students andothers who have occupied Beijing's central Tiananmen Square fornearly three weeks to press their demands for democracy. The UnitedStates is host to an estimated 40,000 students from China.   Yu said he knows of no one who has run afoul of the law in Chinafor taking money in for protesters. ``Most people have relatives inthe United States that send them money from time to time, and theytake it to the streets,'' he said.   Other methods will include electronic transfers betweencompanies doing business in both the United States and China andtransactions carried out in Chinatown storefronts, said Yu, aprofessor of history and East Asian studies.   ``In the states I have guessed we have raised $150,000 fromoverseas Chinese students,'' said activist Pei Minxin, a third-yeargraduate student at Harvard.   ``In the Boston area, several universities pooled theirresources together and we collected something like $37,000. Of thatamount about $11,000 has already channeled back in the form of cashand equipment.''   The rest will be sent when there is confirmation that the moneyhas been spent properly, he said Wednesday.   ``Let's just say the money is being brought in, wired in,transferred in _ all the ways business gets money into the countryis being copied by us,'' Pei said Wednesday. ``The government wouldhave to shut down all the international transactions in order tostop money from being sent in. And that's impossible for them.''   He said money is being taken in by tourists and other``good-hearted people,'' none of whom are given large sums so asnot to arouse suspicion with bulging wallets. Pei also said heknows of no one who has run afoul of Chinese authorities.   ``They've got to catch people delivering money and even that isvery hard, because we can say he's paying off a debt, it's just arelative's money,'' Pei said.   Storefront transactions are routinely used by Chinese to sendgifts home, said Justin Yu, a reporter for the World Journal,America's largest Chinese language newspaper.   For example, a person leaves $100 with a storefront operator,who then has a contact in China deliver the equivalent in Chinesemoney out of his own pocket to the intended recipient, the reportersaid. In return, the contact has $100 on deposit outside thecountry.   ``It's illegal activity, but it's not secret in the Chinesecommunity,'' said Yu, president of the Chinese Language Press Clubin New York. ``Too many people are doing this kind of business. Youjust can't stop it anymore.''   Justin Yu said supporters of the students are also takingadvantage of U.S.-Chinese business links by putting down money for,say, a fax machine, at an electronics company in America; themerchandise is picked up at a connected store in China.</TEXT></DOC>
