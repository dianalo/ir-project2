The report, compiled by Bell Communications ResearchCorp., also will show that the software didn't cause thefailures alone. Faulty data, failure of computer clocks andother triggers led to a chain of events that caused theoutages, according to the Dallas Morning News, which said itobtained a copy of the report.</LP><TEXT>   The newspaper said the report will conclude that none ofthe &quot;trigger&quot; events were caused by computer hackers.   The disclosure echoes testimony before Congress last July,in which DSC officials admitted that three bits ofinformation in a huge computer program were incorrect,omitting computational procedures that would have stoppedDSC's signaling systems from becoming congested withmessages.   A spokesman for DSC, which makes the signal transfer pointthat carries signals to set up a call, but not the callitself, confirmed that a &quot;6&quot; in a line of computer codeshould actually have been a &quot;D.&quot; That one error caused theequipment and software to fail under an avalanche ofcomputer-generated messages. The error was in an Aprilsoftware modification for the signal transfer point systems.   The spokesman said the company won't distribute finalcopies of the report until Bellcore, as the researchconsortium of the Baby Bells is known, presents a copy to theFCC and a congressional telecommunications committee,possibly this week.   While the error has been fixed and the outages haven'trecurred, the mistake has continued to haunt DSC. In partbecause of the problem and partly because of a weak economy,the company posted a net loss of $100.3 million, including$55 million in charges and write-downs, for the first ninemonths. Revenue was $348.3 million, a 5% drop from theyear-earlier period, although third-quarter revenue fell 23%from the prior year. The loss put the company in violation ofcertain terms of its debt agreements, but it said last monththat it has reached tentative agreements to restructure itsdebt and restore its credit line.</TEXT></DOC>
