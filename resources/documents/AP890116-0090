One killed a 15-year-old girl who was walking in a graveyard,residents of the area said.   Western diplomats in embassies near the road to the airport saidthey heard eight rockets land. It was the first reported attacksince Dec. 27 by Moslem insurgents, who have moved into the hillsaround the capital as Soviet soldiers leave Afghanistan to meet aFeb. 15 deadline.   An Interior Ministry statement said the rockets hit the Qalyszmandistrict, a neighborhood where most houses are built of mud. It saidcasualties included women and children, but did not elaborate.   Guerrillas have increased pressure on supply convoys bound forthe capital.   On Sunday, Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze of the SovietUnion ended a three-day visit with a pledge of arms supplies to thegovernment after the remaining 50,000 Soviet soldiers are gone.   Shevardnadze implied the withdrawal would go ahead as scheduledand said his government believes the army of President Najib cancope with the insurgents on its own.   Moslem guerrillas began fighting after a communist coup in April1978 and use border towns and refugee camps in Pakistan, to whichmillions of Afghans have fled, as bases and supply points. They aresupported by Pakistan and the United States.   Soviet soldiers entered Afghanistan in December 1979 and wereestimated to number 115,000 when the withdrawal began May 15 underan agreement mediated by the United Nations.   Moscow has insisted that communists have a role in a postwargovernment, but the guerrillas refuse and broke off talks withKremlin representatives Jan. 6.   An insurgent news agency in Islamabad, Pakistan, said Mondayguerrillas had overrun two military posts in the border area butallowed 200 food trucks through to Kabul.   It said the posts were captured in the past week and put theguerrillas within three miles of Jalalabad, a government-held city42 miles from Pakistan.   There was no independent confirmation of the report, which saidinsurgents captured six tanks and 3,000 weapons. Guerrilla sourcesclaimed 600 Afghan soldiers and militiamen surrendered.   Guerrillas also claimed to have increased attacks near Kandaharin the southeast, Herat in the west and in northern provinces on theSoviet burder.   Their news agency said about 200 supply trucks were allowed intoKabul last week to relieve food and fuel shortages. Reports in thecapital, however, said insurgents continued to attack highwayconvoys and few supplies were reaching the city.   Lines for food and fuel begin to form in early morning. Pricesare rising rapidly in Kabul and power blackouts last several hours aday.</TEXT></DOC>
