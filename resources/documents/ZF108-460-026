 It's not known what the actual figure is becauseless than 15 per cent of these crimes are ever reported.andM;Speaking to a meeting of the Information Processing Association (IPAC)recently, Det.andP;  Sgt.andP;  Ted Green of the Ontario Provincial Police'sAnti-Rackets Branch said the OPP has faced an uphill battle in educatingcorporations on the prevention of computer crime.&quot;The difficulty indescribing computer crime,&quot; says Green, &quot;is in its definition.&quot;andM;The police call it computer-related crime, and define it as &quot;any crime thatinvolves a computer as an integral part of the crime, and which could nothave been committed without the computer.&quot;andM;Major corporations are often unaware of their vulnerability.andP;  As a result,Green is an advocate of what he calls &quot;proactive policing,&quot; which is creatingawareness of the possibilities for wrongdoing as well as the investigation ofcomplaints.andM;With people in key positions onside, security can be tightened beforeproblems occur, he argues.andM;Nowhere is safe.andP;  Computer-related crime exists in every city and town.andP;  Andmost of it is committed by long-time, trusted employees -- pillars of thecommunity.andM;Even when they're caught, though, employers more often than not simplydismiss the employee instead of prosecuting.andP;  Green suggests three mainreasons for this: corporations perceive criminal investigations as bad fortheir image; they upset the shareholders; and, companies refuse to admittheir vulnerability.andP;  As a result, these employees are free to go elsewhereand repeat the offence.andP;  The offences vary from petty to major, but theaverage cost of a computer-related crime is high.andP;  While the average takefrom a bank robbery is just over $5,000, and bank fraud tends to produceabout $16,500, the take from an average computer crime is $178,000.andM;For example, one individual netted more than $1 million in an elaboratecomputer-assisted cheque-kiting scheme.andP;  Cheque-kiting refers to the processof continually writing one cheque to cover another, taking advantage of thetime it takes to process each cheque from one bank to the next.andP;  Theindividual was not prosecuted but after the incident, the financialinstitutions involved modified their systems to prevent a repeat.andM;Another potential problem lies in logic bombs.andP;  There have been severalinstances in which an employee planted programs that potentially could havedestroyed his employer's systems and which he alone could defuse, and thenblackmailed the employer.andP;  The Criminal Code of Canada now containsprovisions under which this offence can be prosecuted.andM;Two sections of the Criminal Code now specifically deal with computer crime.andO;Section 342 covers Unauthorized Use and provides for up to 10 yearsimprisonment for anyone who &quot;fraudulently and without color of right,&quot; usescomputer services, intercepts any function of a computer system or uses acomputer system with the intent to commit an offence under the preceding twopoints.andM;Section 430, Computer Mischief, deals with cases in which data is destroyed,altered, rendered meaningless or useless, and cases in which access to or useof data by authorized persons is somehow obstructed.andM;Green warns, however, that for organizations, the cost of not being educatedin the basics of computer-related crime can be substantial.andP;  For example, incase of theft of information, a company must show that it has tried toprotect itself and its data before prosecution can be successful.andP;  Green saysthere have been several recent cases in the courts which died immediatelybecause the victims had not even changed system passwords in five years.andM;For organizations seeking help, the OPP has published the Executive Guide toComputer Crime andamp; Security, which offers the following advice:andM;* establish an overall policy listing objectives, then assign one person theresponsibility for computer security;andM;* conduct a security review to establish vulnerable areas, then select andimplement safeguards;andM;* make employees aware of security through briefings and (possibly)employment contracts;andM;* establish and test recovery plans; and,andM;* report suspected computer crime to both senior management and the police.andM;Green emphasizes that, where evidence exists, the police will prosecute allinstances of computer-related crime.andP;  But, he stresses, they can only do soif it's reported.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
