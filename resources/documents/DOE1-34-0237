Since the isomerizationreaction is reversible, with only 10% to 15% of the xylose convertedto xylulose at equilibrium at fermentation temperatures (30{sup 0}-37{sup0}C), a process configuration is used to continuously remove xylulosefrom the fermentation allowing for maximal isomerization rates and hencehigh rates of ethanol production. A DNA fragment containing the genefor xylose isomerase was isolated from a bacterium, E. coli, and thenreintroduced into various strains of this bacterium using plasmid vectorsthat allow for massive production of the enzyme. This has been completelysuccessful; it is estimated that as much as 40% of the total proteinin the cells represents xylose isomerase, and equivalent overexpressionhas been obtained in all strains tested. This overproduced enzyme ishighly active and the cells containing the enzyme have been used to convertxylose to ethanol by a bench-scale process.</TEXT></DOC>
