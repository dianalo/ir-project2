SHEERAN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Texas billionaire Robert Bass may want to buyRevco D.S. Inc. for $925 million because he thinks the nation'saging population will be spending more money in Revco drug stores,an analyst said Tuesday.   Bass leads a group of investors bidding for the privately held1,900-store chain, which is the first big leveraged buyout to filefor protection from creditors in U.S. Bankruptcy Court.   The deal would add $260 million in debt to the books of acompany that was plunged into Bankruptcy Court last year because itcouldn't keep up with its existing debt payments. It went privatein a $1.3 billion leveraged buyout in 1986.   Jeffrey Stein of McDonald andamp; Co. of Cleveland said the offerreflected Revco's prescription business, which is about 30 percentof its sales, and the increasing number of older Americans moredependent on prescription drugs.   Revco's stores in 27 states fill 65 million prescriptions yearly.   ``The company still has a strong franchise in the drugstoreindustry,'' said Stein.   Revco spokeswoman Diana Lueptow declined to comment on merits ofthe Bass bid, saying not enough information was available. She saidthe company technically considers it an expression of interestrather than an offer. Under Chapter 11, Revco itself has firstrights until Feb. 28 to propose any reorganization plan for thecompany.   The bid was made in an Oct. 20 letter from Acadia Partners andthe Robert M. Bass Group Inc. of Fort Worth, Texas, and made publicMonday.   The $925 million figure overstates what the Bass-led group wouldactually put up for Revco. It would pay $150 million in cash forall stock in the reorganized company and assume responsibility for$515 million of debt on Revco's books. It would also have thereorganized company borrow an additional $260.5 million.   The Bass organization has a policy that ``we don't discuss anybusiness with the news media,'' said a woman handling newsinquiries at Bass offices in Fort Worth. She declined to identifyherself.   Acadia Partners specializes in leveraged acquisitions and iscapitalized in excess of $1.6 billion. Principal partners includethe Bass group, American Express Co., Equitable Life AssuranceSociety of the U.S. and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.   Robert Bass, whose holdings were valued at $1.6 billion in thelatest Forbes 400 list of wealthy individuals, has interests inreal estate, finances and oil.   David Schulte, who advises Revco creditors on bankruptcy issues,and Stuart Hertzberg of Detroit, representing Revco suppliers, wereunavailable for comment Tuesday.   Anac Holding Corp., parent of Revco D.S. Inc., reported afirst-quarter loss Sept. 29 of $16.2 million, compared with a $27.9million loss for the same period last year. Sales increased 2.4percent, from $583 million to $597 million.   Revco was hampered late last year by dwindling stocks amidstsupplier concerns. It is ``fully in stock and looking forward tothe upcoming holiday season,'' the company saidin a preview ofRevco's second quarter, which ends in late November.   Stein said that, if bought at the right price, Revco couldoperate profitably because it currently operates at a profit beforecorporate debt payments are taken into account.</TEXT></DOC>
