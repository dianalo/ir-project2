Gutfreund's 38-year career at SalomonBrothers Inc. ended with two calls from the Federal ReserveBank of New York.   On Thursday afternoon, Mr. Gutfreund, a legendary WallStreet survivor, was still insisting he would ride out hisfirm's unfolding Treasury-bidding scandal. In meetings thatday with top Salomon executives, Mr. Gutfreund's message wasclear: He planned to tough it out. Nestled in his elegant43rd-floor office overlooking the Hudson River, he toldSalomon executives: &quot;A lot of people are upset, the stock'sdown big, but we'll work our way out of this.&quot;                                                                                                          But then came the calls from powerful New York FedPresident E. Gerald Corrigan, one on Thursday night and oneearly Friday morning. Mr. Corrigan was furious aboutSalomon's admissions that it repeatedly violated rules at theTreasury's multibillion-dollar note auctions. He demandedthat Mr. Gutfreund take immediate action.   He got it. Less than six hours after the second call, Mr.Gutfreund offered to resign as Salomon's chairman and chiefexecutive and Thomas W. Strauss offered to resign aspresident. Yesterday, amid new sanctions levied by theTreasury Department, the Salomon Inc. board accepted theirresignations along with that of Vice Chairman John W.Meriwether in an attempt to stanch the worst scandal in thebig investment bank's 81-year history. Billionaire investorWarren Buffett, looking to protect his 16% Salomon stake,took the reins as interim chairman and chief executive. Inhis first move yesterday, Mr. Buffett named Deryck C.Maughan, an eight-year Salomon veteran recently based inTokyo, as chief operating officer.   For the 61-year-old Mr. Gutfreund, the week's events capone of the swiftest falls for a leading Wall Street chiefexecutive. Just a few weeks ago, Salomon was reveling inrecord six-months earnings, driven largely by profits frombond trading. But Wall Street executives say it was Mr.Gutfreund's hubris that led to his downfall and to thescandal that has crippled the firm he epitomized, which heonce boasted was &quot;the greatest trading organization the worldhas ever known.&quot; The swagger that made Salomon one of themost feared trading powers on Wall Street may evaporate withMr. Gutfreund's departure.   At Mr. Buffett's first meeting with Salomon employees, hesuggested the investment bank should take fewer risks. In apep talk to about 100 Salomon managing directors in thefirm's 39th-floor conference room Friday evening, Mr. Buffettsaid any action by Salomon even approaching impropriety won'tbe tolerated. &quot;Anything not only on the line, but near theline, will be called out,&quot; a senior managing director saidMr. Buffett told them.   For Salomon, the tough times are only beginning. Theembattled investment bank is struggling to reassure nervouscreditors. Securities firms such as Salomon borrow heavily tofund their trading and other activities, so a funding crisisis potentially devastating. More than $1.1 billion ofSalomon's commercial paper, or short-term IOUs, is coming duein the next few weeks.   Salomon can turn to a $2 billion backup line of creditfrom banks led by Citibank and Bank of America. But majorcredit-rating agencies said late last week they may downgradeSalomon's $7 billion in long-term debt and $7.7 billion incommercial paper, an action that would increase Salomon'sborrowing costs.   Yesterday morning, just as the Salomon Inc. board meetingbegan, the Treasury Department barred Salomon from bidding atfurther Treasury auctions until &quot;appropriate steps are takento address irregularities, and pending the results of ongoinginvestigations.&quot; A few hours later, after Mr. Buffett wasformally voted chairman -- and after several phoneconversations between him and Treasury Secretary NicholasBrady -- the Treasury reduced the scope of Salomon'ssuspension and said the firm could continue to bid atauctions, but only for its own account. This damagesSalomon's power as a bond firm by prohibiting it from buyingTreasury securities at auctions on behalf of clients.   Says a Salomon Brothers executive: &quot;We're not out of thewoods at all.&quot;   Salomon faces other major hurdles. Government regulatorspromise a top-to-bottom investigation of all of Salomon'strading activities. Defections are sure to rock the firm, asbonuses are threatened. Salomon will have to set asidereserves for possible substantial government fines and forpotential civil liability from burgeoning investor lawsuits.That could wipe out some or all the firm's record six-monthearnings this year of $451 million.   Mr. Gutfreund, a one-time bond trader, kept his tough-guyimage to the end. Late Friday, after formally offering toresign, Mr. Gutfreund, dressed nattily in his trademark darksuit and white shirt, told top executives at a closed-doormeeting: &quot;I'm not apologizing for anything to anybody.Apologies don't mean {expletive}. What happened, happened.&quot;   The same arrogance that enabled Mr. Gutfreund to buildSalomon into the dominant force in the $2.3 trillion Treasurysecurities market also led to his becoming ensnared in agovernment trap that became his undoing. The seeds of hisdemise were sown shortly after the Treasury's May 1991auction of $12.26 billion of two-year notes. Within days ofthe auction, institutions caught in a &quot;squeeze&quot; complained toboth the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Treasurythat they believed Salomon had cornered the market in thenotes, grabbing much more than the 35% limit to which it wasentitled at the auction.   In the wake of those complaints, government officialscarefully laid out a plan of attack for uncovering potentialwrongdoing by Salomon.   In a series of conference calls the week after theauction, officials of the SEC, the Justice Department, theTreasury and the Federal Reserve agreed that rather thaninforming Salomon of their concerns, they would quietlymonitor trading in the new two-year Treasury notes. Theseofficials agreed that Salomon shouldn't, under anycircumstances, be told that it was under investigation.   For the next three weeks, officials of the SEC, workingwith Treasury and the Justice Department, pieced together howthey believed Salomon might have cornered the market. Becausethe agencies didn't want to let on that they wereinvestigating Salomon, they waited until the securitiesbought at auction went through a New York-based clearingfirm. With records subpoenaed from that firm, they couldretrace the commitments Salomon had made to clients beforethe auction occurred and the delivery of those securities inthe after-market.   By mid-June, suspicious regulators sent subpoenas fordocuments to about five Salomon clients. They quickly noticeda discrepancy in at least one case. One large New York firmthat is a Salomon client appeared to have sold back toSalomon some $500 million of notes soon after the auction.That meant that Salomon itself had bought far more than the35% of the two-year note issue to which it was entitled.   Salomon was only notified that it was under formalinvestigation by the SEC and Justice Department during thelast week of June, when it received subpoenas for documentsand trading records.   Martin Lipton, a founding partner of the elite New Yorklaw firm of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen andamp; Katz, was immediatelycontacted by Mr. Gutfreund and told about the subpoenas. Mr.Lipton, working with Wachtell partner Lawrence Pedowitz, aformer top prosecutor in the U.S. attorney's office in NewYork, quickly determined that if the SEC and JusticeDepartment were focusing on the May auction, the Wachtelllawyers should undertake to learn everything the governmentwas looking at, too.   After the July 4th holiday, the Wachtell attorneys beganinterviewing each of the traders and clerks on Salomon'sgovernment-bond desk in its cavernous trading floor in theWorld Trade Center here.   Paul Mozer and Thomas Murphy, the desk's two top traders,who were both managing directors, hired their own lawyers.   Salomon hasn't released details of the internalinvestigation. But according to individuals familiar with thereport, Wachtell concluded that Messrs. Mozer and Murphy had,on at least five occasions, violated bidding rules atTreasury auctions. The most recent violation, the lawyersconcluded, occurred in the May auction. Lawyers for Messrs.Mozer and Murphy declined comment.   Salomon has disclosed that it violated government biddingrules in at least four Treasury-note auctions in the pasteight months. The firm admitted that it had submitted bids inthe names of customers who hadn't authorized it to do so, andrepeatedly violated Treasury rules that bar anyone frombuying more than 35% of a Treasury issue at an auction.Yesterday, Salomon fired Mr. Mozer, whom the firm paid $10million last year, and Mr. Murphy.   Its most damaging admission, though, was that Messrs.Gutfreund, Strauss and Meriwether were told in April thatSalomon had made an illegal bid in a Treasury-note auctionsale, but didn't report the wrongdoing to the governmentuntil last week.   Salomon conceded last week that just before a Treasuryauction in February, one of the fired managing directors --believed to be Mr. Mozer -- persuaded a customer to play a&quot;practical joke&quot; on a Salomon employee. As a result, Salomonsubmitted a phony $1 billion unauthorized bid in the name ofa customer, purchased the securities, but never told theTreasury about the incident.   Mr. Mozer apparently realized the end was near in lateApril. At a news conference yesterday, Mr. Buffett said thatMr. Mozer at that time received a copy of a letter from aregulator seeking information from a Salomon client about adiscrepancy in bids in connection with a February auction.Although the government didn't have any knowledge ofwrongdoing at that time, Mr. Mozer was apparently concernedenough to report another unauthorized bid to Mr. Meriwether,who in turn discussed the problem with Messrs. Gutfreund andStrauss.   Government regulators were shocked and angered by thewrongdoing admitted by Salomon, which has tarnished theintegrity of the $2.3 trillion Treasury market. Onegovernment official fumes about the &quot;level of arrogance.&quot; Hesays it is shocking that Salomon &quot;could do it at the Februaryauction, learn about it in April, not tell us, and do itagain in May.&quot;   But on top of that, Salomon's strategy of beating thegovernment to the punch by publicly disclosing wrongdoingbefore the government could complete its investigationfurther angered regulators.   Mr. Lipton phoned the SEC, the Justice Department, theTreasury and the Fed on the morning of Aug. 9, told officialsat those agencies of the general conclusions of the Salomoninternal report and agreed to meet the following Wednesday.   But the same day, Salomon released a statement to themedia saying it was under investigation in connection withits submission of bids in certain Treasury auctions.   On Wednesday, Salomon supplied additional details to thegovernment based on the conclusions of its internal report.The actual report itself wasn't shared. Government officialswere furious. The amount of wrongdoing that the internalreport found went well beyond what Wachtell had previouslydisclosed. Indeed, the SEC, the Fed and Justice hadn't anyidea of the February &quot;practical joke&quot; or of the failure ofMessrs. Gutfreund, Strauss and Meriwether to do anythingabout it.   According to attorneys with knowledge of theinvestigation, Wachtell was worried that damaging andmisleading information might be conveyed to the press bygovernment lawyers. Wachtell was concerned that ifinformation was going to get out, it should reach the publicwith Salomon's own spin. Wachtell also hoped that theappearance of full disclosure to the public would help itavoid a long, drawn-out investigation and constant publicity,as occurred during the Drexel investigation that began in1986 and ended only last year.   Messrs. Mozer and Murphy are understood to differ sharplywith the official Salomon version of events, claiming that incertain instances, customers had authorized the use of theirnames for purposes of bidding. The two apparently also rejectthe idea that Salomon led a market squeeze in May. They willlikely tell their stories to government officials before toolong.   Mr. Gutfreund's downfall is particularly ironic since heoften boasted that his firm was untouched by Wall Street'sinsider-trading scandal. He was one of the most vocal criticsof Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and Michael Milken, its fallenjunk-bond king.   Only a month ago, fresh from record six-month earnings,Salomon scored a significant coup but alienated rival MerrillLynch andamp; Co. by snatching the lead role in Time Warner's stockoffering from Merrill Lynch after a secret meeting betweenMr. Gutfreund and Time Warner Chairman Steven J. Ross.   Nor had Mr. Gutfreund made many new friends in recentyears. Gossip columnists regularly poked fun at Mr. Gutfreundand his second wife, Susan, a former flight attendant, fortheir extravagant society parties. Salomon and Mr. Gutfreundalso were hurt by the firm's depiction in the best-sellingbook &quot;Liar's Poker,&quot; which chronicled the bawdy antics ofsome Salomon traders. At Salomon's 1990 annual meeting, Mr.Gutfreund admitted that the book had made the firm &quot;alaughing-stock&quot; and caused tension with clients. But, headded, &quot;We have overcome that by doing our job well.&quot;   The biggest blow to the firm may not be the loss of Mr.Gutfreund or even the easygoing Mr. Strauss. Rather, Salomonexecutives are worried about defections stemming from theresignation of the 44-year-old Mr. Meriwether, who ran thefirm's highly profitable bond-arbitrage group.   These high-tech traders employ rigorous mathematicalmethods to make huge bets on tiny price discrepancies betweensecurities. Mr. Meriwether's close-knit group was thrust intothe spotlight earlier this year when it was disclosed thatLawrence Hilibrand, a 31-year-old managing director in thegroup, made $23 million in salary and bonus last year. (Mr.Meriwether made about $10 million last year, people familiarwith the firm say.)   The debate over Mr. Meriwether's fate boiled over Friday,when the Salomon Brothers board met. At the board's behest,Messrs. Gutfreund, Strauss and Meriwether left the room, andthe board began discussing their futures. &quot;Is John out?&quot; oneboard member asked. &quot;Absolutely,&quot; was the reply. &quot;Is Tommyout?&quot; &quot;Absolutely.&quot; But they disagreed about Mr. Meriwether.   While a majority of the board members wanted Mr.Meriwether to resign, others argued that he should be given achance to defend himself and stay on in a limited capacity,given the money he earned for the firm.   Yesterday, Mr. Meriwether's opponents won out and Mr.Meriwether tendered his resignation. But he insisted heshouldn't be held responsible, even though he directlyoversaw the activities of Messrs. Mozer and Murphy. &quot;When Ilearned of their improper conduct, I immediately reportedwhat I knew to the appropriate senior officers of the firmand to our inside counsel, and I concurred in the decisionthat they would promptly notify the regulatory authorities,&quot;Mr. Meriwether said in a statement.   Privately, Salomon insiders say Mr. Meriwether was fuming.On Friday, he told associates he objected to &quot;being joined atthe hip&quot; with Messrs. Gutfreund and Strauss. In hisstatement, Mr. Meriwether said: &quot;I am confident that theinternal and governmental reviews of the situation willconfirm that I acted properly at all times, but I believethat my resignation today is in the best interests of thefirm.&quot;   At a crowded news conference yesterday afternoon, Mr.Buffett made clear that he wouldn't be running Salomon forlong. &quot;I do not want this job to last any longer thannecessary,&quot; he said.   &quot;The most important job we have is to come clean in anaggressive way&quot; to regulators, Mr. Buffett said. He added:&quot;My job is to clean up the sins of the past and capitalize onthe enormous attributes that this firm has.&quot;   Mr. Buffett conceded that Salomon's freewheeling,aggressive style probably contributed to its currentdifficulties. He said that style would be toned down. &quot;Therewere aspects of the culture that could have contributed tothat,&quot; Mr. Buffett said. &quot;{It is} what some might call macho,some might call cavalier.&quot;   He said the &quot;behavior and goals&quot; of the top officials willchange. &quot;Do I think everyone will get the message? No,&quot; Mr.Buffett said. But he said those people will &quot;be out&quot; of thefirm quickly. &quot;I intend to set an example that people willtake quite seriously.&quot;   Right now, Salomon's biggest hurdle is to convincecustomers and creditors that it is worthy of keeping theirtrust and that it is a creditworthy institution. It must alsopersuade the Federal Reserve Bank of New York that itdeserves to maintain its designation as one of the 40 primarydealers allowed to trade directly with the Fed.   Losing its primary dealership would be a major blow.That's because many institutional investors will only dobusiness with a primary dealer when buying and selling U.S.government and other securities. The New York Fed isconsidering penalties ranging from temporarily suspending itstrading relationship with Salomon to revoking Salomon'sprimary dealership and forcing it to reapply. With thecentral bank's credibility on the line, some on Wall Streetbelieve the Fed will be forced to make an example of thefirm.   The Treasury's suspension of Salomon from bidding forcustomers at auctions may give rivals a rare opportunity tomake inroads into Salomon's long-standing relationships withsome of the world's biggest investors.   Salomon's Treasury bond desk is crucial to many of itsother businesses. For instance, Treasury securities are thekey to many of the sophisticated financial transactions --such as swaps, futures and options -- in which Salomon isconsidered a leader.   Like other securities firms, Salomon funds its hugetrading positions with a combination of equity, long-termdebt, commercial paper and bank borrowings. Salomon, sayanalysts, is vulnerable because of its heavy reliance oncommercial paper, with $7.7 billion of such debt nowoutstanding world-wide. Salomon must refinance $1.1 billionof that within the next two weeks.   &quot;Rolling over&quot; that $1.1 billion, say analysts and U.S.officials, will be the first big test of what Salomon'screditors now think of the firm.   John G. Macfarlane III, Salomon's 37-year-old treasurer,is confident Salomon can deal with the situation, even ifbuyers balk. &quot;Were we not to roll over any of the outstandingcommercial paper, we would have no difficulty funding all ofour assets, because we have adequate alternative sources offunds,&quot; he says. In stages, he says, the firm would borrowagainst unencumbered securities it currently owns, whichamount to $9.3 billion in market value; utilize bank linesthat &quot;have been reconfirmed with most of our major U.S.lenders&quot; and draw down the $2 billion commercial paper backupfunding that the firm has never used.   If all else failed, Salomon could begin selling offassets, 71% of which consist of highly liquid U.S. Treasurysecurities, U.S. federal agency securities and debt issued bymajor foreign governments such as Japan and Germany.   The strength of Salomon's liquidity management, says Mr.Macfarlane, rests in its diversity of instruments,maturities, currencies and lenders. &quot;We're in good shape;from a liquidity standpoint, I don't think we're vulnerable,&quot;says Mr. Macfarlane. He adds that as Salomon has presentedits funding position to lenders since the crisis broke, &quot;theresponse has been quite favorable.&quot;   &quot;Salomon has strong financial management plus a goodalternative liquidity system in place,&quot; says John J. Kriz, avice president at Moody's Investors Service Inc. &quot;In Salomon,you are looking at a company with a healthy level of capital.It's profitable, has good quality assets, has good businessesand is liquid.&quot;   A big German bank said that some European institutions hadquietly lowered their trading limits with Salomon. Big U.S.banks have mostly stood by Salomon and not cut either lendingor trading lines, but a spokesman for one New York bank saysthat top management was reviewing the situation daily. At theleast, some analysts expect banks to increase the cost of theloans and credit lines they extend to Salomon when theymature.   ---   Michael R.
