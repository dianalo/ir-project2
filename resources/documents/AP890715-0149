The debt-financed megabid crazein America has thundered across the Atlantic with a vengeance in theform of a hostile $21 billion offer for leading conglomerate BATIndustries PLC, shattering an assumption that the biggest Europeanbusinesses are immune from attack.   Regardless of whether Anglo-French financier Sir JamesGoldsmith's investor group succeeds in its offer for the Britishcompany, the bid has rewritten the rules and could incite a spree ofmultbillion dollar deals.   ``It has sent shivers down the spines of the chief executives ofmany of our companies,'' says Philip Healey, editor of the Britishpublication Acquisitions Monthly.   Nonetheless, such large takeovers financed with borrowed moneyface considerable obstacles in Britain and elsewhere in Europe,where the buying and selling of companies historically has been muchmore conservative and slow-moving than in the United States.   Most high-profile American deals have taken the form of aleveraged buyout, in which a would-be buyer puts up almost no cashbut borrows the purchase price, pledging the target company's assetsas collateral. After the deal is completed, the new owner sells offpieces of the company to repay the debt.   Many European investors have doubts about following the U.S.buyout trend. They are less keen on borrowingly heavily, tend to bemore loyal to companies and are more sensitive about post-takeoverjob losses.   Yet, said Johnathan Mervis, chief executive of J.P. Mervis Ltd.,an acquisitions adviser, ``Time has moved on and the opposition isnot quite as firm as it was.''   The announcement last Tuesday of the BAT bid, which nearly rivalsthe record $25 billion purchase of RJR Nabisco Inc. earlier thisyear, means that ``in the British takeover scene, the perception hasbeen totally changed. This has really changed the whole ball game,''Healey said in an interview.   ``If they are going to take pot shots at BAT, who else is safe?''he said. ``There are very few companies safe.''   Europe's economy already has been influenced by an accelerationin takeovers, spurred partly by the perception that many companiesare undervalued, particularly since the October 1987 stock marketcrash.   The approach of 1992, when Europe becomes a trade-barrier freemarketplace of 320 million consumers, also has played a role in theincreased number of corporate mergers. Many company strategists seeacquisitions as a good way to prepare for an onslaught ofcompetition from inside and outside Europe.   In addition, a generation of postwar entrepreneurs are nowapproaching retirement. Many are looking for buyers because theirown children aren't interested in running the family business.   Britain is Europe's busiest takeover battlefield _ the number ofBritish deals has quadrupled in the past five years _ because thereare more publicly held companies and bidders face fewer corporatedefenses and regulatory hurdles than in other European countries.   Indeed, Goldsmith chose Britain after becoming disenchanted withthe United States, where competition among dealmakers has squeezedreturns and where the most obvious takeover targets have beenplucked.   According to Acquisitions Monthly, a record 2,241 takeovers ofBritish companies worth 37.6 billion pounds or $61.3 billion werecompleted last year, vs. 1,937 deals worth 27.7 billion pounds or$45.2 billion in 1987.   Prices soared on London's Stock Exchange this past week onexpectations that other British corporate giants would becometargets now that the ground has been broken. Shares in otherEuropean bourses also jumped.   Many British investment strategists say takeover activity hasbecome a strong underpinning for the London market.   ``A lot of people now are seeing the low value of some of ourvery large and very successful companies,'' Healey said.   But others question whether a bonanza for takeover investors isimminent in Britain.   ``I'm not sure that will happen,'' said Mervis. ``I think that itwill all settle down.''   Analysts doubted the Goldsmith group could woo BAT's large-scaleshareholders with a bid that is 80 percent debt-financed.   ``The institutional investors are very hostile to such bids,''Healey said.   BAT Chairman Patrick Sheehy described the offer as ``anill-conceived attempt at destructive financial engineering.''   The bidders, who also include British merchant banker JacobRothschild and Australian entrepreneur Kerry Packer, will have topay a higher price and include some cash to win, analysts said.   Goldsmith has said he wants to dismantle BAT by selling off itsnon-tobacco interests, which include financial services, retailingand paper. But many Europeans fear that breaking up companies canworsen Europe's relatively high unemployment.   ``Will chief executives be more worried about takeovers thanrunning their companies?'' said Healey. He expressed concern thattakeover paranoia could make corporate bosses change basic strategyto the detriment of their companies' long-term futures. For example,they might spend or borrow huge sums to repurchase stock insteadusing the money for research and investment.   ``What might come out later is the political backlash,'' Healeysaid. ``Is this good for Great Britain PLC?''   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government, although a strongsupporter of free market forces, has blocked big takeovers in thepast, including the Australian company Elders IXL Ltd.'s bid forliquor company Allied-Lyons PLC.   But one of two rival bids for Gateway Corp., a large supermarketoperator, is expected to succeed.   The British takeover scene has attracted many Americanparticipants, including leveraged buyout leader Kohlberg KravisRoberts and Co., the takeover strategist firm Wasserstein, Perellaand Co., and speculator Asher Edelman.   In the BAT battle, the Goldsmith group has lined up Bankers TrustCo. and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. to help finance its offer, andBAT has enlisted Goldman Sachs and Co. and Shearson Lehman HuttonInc. for a defensive response.</TEXT><NOTE>End adv for Sunday July 16</NOTE></DOC>
