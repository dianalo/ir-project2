 However, these guidelines should be qualified since theempirical literature on the effects of color is troubled by poor researchdesigns and is lacking in consistent and conclusive findings [13].andO;Researchers view color itself as an elusive design variable [20] becausethere has been little analysis of the interrelatedness of color as a variablewith other presentation variables, and because of flawed research designswhich prohibit meaningful interpretation.andM;The purpose of this study is two-fold: theory develoment and practicalapplication.andP;  First, the study examines the effects of color on performancewithin a carefully designed program of research whose purpose is theorydevelopment.andP;  It is this type of systematic research resulting in consistent,valid, and cumulative findings that can be used to develop theory forunderstanding a complex phenomenon.andP;  Second, the stdy is practicallyapplicable for practitioners faced with the changing technologies ofgraphical output.andP;  It answers basic questions about the use of color withinformation presentations.andM;The Program of Research for Investigating Management Information Systems(PRIMIS) [19] provides the conceptual model for studying and developingtheory on color and graphics within the user-system interface.andP;  PreviousPRIMIS graphics research [11, 22, 30[ has investigated the effects of form ofpresentation (F), question complexity (Q), and information complexity (I) onperformance (P) as measured by speed and accuracy in an informationextraction task.andP;  These measures are operationalizations of constructsarticulated by Berlin in his Semiology of Graphics [3].andP;  A formal statementof the functional relationship among these variables is:andM;P = f(I, Q, F)andM;Another construct of interest within Betin's treatise is that of color (C).andO;The study reported here introduces color as a variable within PRIMIS graphicsresearch and measures its relationship to form of presentation in terms oftheir single and joint effects on performance.andP;  By examining the effects ofcolor and its interrelatedness with other variables, the theoreticalfoundation for understanding how humans use graphics as decision aids isexpanded.andP;  A formal statement of the functional relationship examined is:andM;P = f(I, Q, F, C)andM;Specially, this study focuses on answering the following questions:andM;1.andP;  Is there a significant difference between subjects' performance in aninformation extraction task using multicolor (color) vs.andP;  monocolor (mono)information presentations?andM;2.andP;  Does the use of color have different effects on performance withdifferent forms of information presentation when the colors are used in thesame way across the various forms?andP;  If so, what are these differences?andM;The answers to these questions are as important to practitioners as toacademic researchers.andP;  According to the current literature, managers arelooking to reserach to help them resolve the conflicting reports concerninggraphics design and to guide them in the selection and use of graphicstechnologies [26].andP;  A basic question with all technological change is whetheror not it will improve the productivity of its target audience.andP;  This studydirectly addresses the question of improved performance using technologywhich can be incorporated into DDS or ESS.andP;  Financial, accounting, andmarketing data are all incorporated in such systems, and all can be presentedin graphical or tabular formats, with or without color.andP;  With the prevalenceof color technologies and the accompanying vendor claims, it is importantthat basic issues regarding their use be addressed and resolved.andM;BACKGROUND LITERATUREandM;Studies on the use of color in the management information systems (MIS)literature and related disciplines vary in their focus, yet severalcontribute to the understanding of the use of color in business graphics.andO;Gremillion and Jenkins [14] conducted a study in which they examnied theeffects of color-coded tranparencies on information retention fro a lecture.andO;Color was used to emphasize distinctions and relationships in the informationcontent.andP;  The findings showed a significant improvement in recall when colorwas used in a comprehension and learning task.andP;  Similar performanceimprovements in comprehension a~d learning have been documented by Lamberskiand Dwyer [21] and Vogel, Dickson, and Lehman [29].andP;  Improved comprehensionwith the use of color suggests that similar comprehension of graphicalinformation would improve performance in extracting such information from agraph.andM;Empirical studies [5, 6, 8] have examined the performance improving abilityof color in search-and-locate tasks under various conditions.andP;  These studieswere concerned with how color could be used to group information sets tospeed up the location of a specific item.andP;  Similar grouping and locating ofdesired information within a graphical presentation is a first step inextracting that information.andM;Benbasat, Dexter, and Tood [2] conducted a series of lab experiments toexamine the joint and individual effects of color and graphics within thecontext of different user characteristics and task settings.andP;  The decisionmaking task setting was chosen, specifically to require the use of judgmentrather than recall or search-and-locate.andP;  The authors found main effects ofcolor on performance measures and user prerferences as well as an interactionbetween personality and color.andP;  The assumption in these studies is that ifinformation is to be used in making a judgment decision, it must first beextracted from the information presentation.andM;The major findings from the color literature in MIS and the referencedisciplines can be summarized as follows:andM;* color improves performance in a recall taskandM;* color improves performance in a search-and-locate taskandM;* color improves performance in a retention taskandM;* color improves comprehension of instructional materialsandM;* color improves performance in a decision judgment task.andM;Yet, one issue remaining to be demonstrated is that color improves theinformation extraction itself.andM;The study presented here incorporates previous PRIMIS findings [11, 22] bycontrolling for both information and question complexity.andP;  It theninvestigates whether performance using different forms of presentation varieswith multicolor or monocolor presentations; i.e., whether the findings ofLauer [22] and Davis [11] hold when the color variable is included.andP;  Thestudy examines the effects of color in an information extraction task.andP;  Whileit is important to understand the effects of color in a judgment or decisionmaking task, the findings are limited in generalizeability due to the natureof that task.andP;  Information extraction precedes judgment or choice in decisionmaking, and is generic to the various sorts of tasks that are supported byDSS and ESS.andM;EXPERIMENTAL DESIGNandM;The effects of color and form of presentation were examined by conducting alaboratory experiment employing a full factorial (4 X 2) within subjectsdesign.andP;  This design controls subjects' individual differences by moving thebetween subjects variance which can increase the sensitivity of theexperiment to treatment differences.andP;  The laboratory methodology provided forthe control necessary for unambiguous manipulations, measurements, andfindings resulting in minimal confounding of the effects of interest.andM;Variables.andP;  The independent variables are color and form of presentation.andO;Color was presented at two levels: monocolor (mono) and multicolor (color).andO;The colors for the treatments were chosen from the representative set ofcolors accompanying graphic software packages and were used according tocurrently accepted design conventions [16, 24].andP;  In particular, a moderatelevel of saturation and contrast were chosen to minimize a particular color'sability to dominate as its area increased.andP;  Likewise, contiguous bars or pieslices of red/green, blue/yellow, green/blue, and red/blue were avoidedbecause of their tendency to create vibrations, illusions of shadows, andafterimages.andM;The mono treatments were presented in yellow on a black background CRT.andP;  Thebars, lines, and pie slices were differentiated using cross-sectioningpatterns.andP;  An example of the monocolor bar treatment is shown in Figure 1.andO;The monocolor tabular treatment presented a table of numbers in yellow on theblack background CRT.andM;The color treatment used solid lines, pie slices, and bars without anycross-sectioning patterns.andP;  Pilot studies determined that solids produced themost effective and consistent results from among the possible colortreatments [15].andP;  In each case, the bars, pie slices, and lines werepresented in red, white, green, and yellow on a black background CRT.andP;  Theremainder of the treatment (legend, title, question) was presented in cyan.andO;The color tabular treatment presented a table with four rows of numbers: onerow each of red, white, green, and yellow.andP;  As with the graphicalpresentations, the remaining portions of the tables and their accompanyingquestions were presented in cyan.andM;Form of presentation was presented at four levels: pie charts, bar graphs,line graphs, and tables.andP;  The four forms of presentation were used to presenttime-series data.andP;  This is a representative use of graphical and tabular datain DSS and ESS since 75 percent of the information presentations used forbusiness data are time-series in nature [28].andM;The two dependent variables are time of information extraction and accuracyof the extraction.andP;  These variables are recognized in cognitive psychology asbeing jointly important as indicators of mental activity [25].andP;  Likewise,they are regarded as two of the major dependent variables in graphicsresearch [13] and are the most appropriate for measuring performance in aninformation extraction task.andM;Information complexity and question complexity are controlled variables.andO;They are controlled by selecting questions and information presentations inthe mid-range of complexity as determined using previously developed [12, 23]or enhanced [1] metrics.andM;Subjects.andP;  The subjects for the experiment were recruited as volunteers fromthe graduate student population at Indiana University.andP;  A statistical poweranalysis [9] indicated that 18 subjects would be needed to provide a desired.80 power with alpha at the .05 level.andP;  It was decided that 35 to 50 subjectswould be used to increase the power of the test and to satisfy theassumptions of MANOVA.andP;  A total of 53 subjects volunteered for theexperiment.andM;Procedures.andP;  The experiment consisted of three phases: an orientationsession, an experimental session, and a posttest interview.andP;  During theorientation session, the subjects viewed a video-taped presentation givinginstructions concerning the overall procedure of the experiment.andP;  Theexperimental session consisted of a practice session providing feedback tothe subject as to whether or not each question was answered correctly.andP;  Thiswas followed by the experimental treatments consisting of eight pairs ofquestions and information presentations.andM;Each subject worked through all eight treatments.andP;  A single informationpresentation and question appeared concurrently on the CRT.andP;  The subject wasrequired to answer the question using the information presentation on thescreen.andP;  After the subject entered a response to the question, the nextinformation presentation and question appeared.andP;  The subject data wascollected unobtrusively by the system during the experimental task.andP;  Time wasmeasured in the number of seconds (to the nearest hundredth) betweencompleting the display of the information presentation with its accompanyingquestion and the pressing of the [ENTER] key indicating the subject'sresponse.andP;  The accuracy measure, a dichotomous variable, consists of whetheror not the subject answered the question correctly.andM;After the experimental treatments were completed, the subject was given aposttest interview to determine whether the subject understood the purpose ofthe study or had any confusion in performing the task.andP;  Subjects were thentested for color-blindness using Pseudo-Isochromatic plates.andP;  Two subjectswere determined to be color-blind, and their responses were excluded from theexperimental analysis.andM;Data Analysis.andP;  The data were analyzed using the multivariate analysis ofvariance (MANOVA) approach to repeated measures over single dependentvariables.andP;  This technique is not subject to the assumption of equalvariances and covariances and takes into account the subject correlationbetween treatments.andP;  Yet, since each of the dependent variables is animportant measure of performance, they were examined separately.andP;  The datastill violate the assumption of normality with regard to the accuracy dataand independence of the repeated measures.andP;  However, these violations aretolerable, and MANOVA is generally robust to them when there is a reasonablylarge sample size and equal observations per cell [4].andM;The MANOVA technique was used to test for main effects of color and form ofpresentation (C and F) as well as for the interaction effect between the two(C X F).andP;  The test statistic used for the analysis was the Hotelling'sT-squared (TSQ) that tests for equality of means in a repeated measuresdesign [10].andP;  The TSQ statistics were transformed for use with theF-distribution.andP;  In addition, planned and post hoc comparisons were made tofurther examine the nature of the effects.andM;EXPERIMENTAL RESULTSandM;Table I presents the cell means and standard deviations for the time data.andO;The means are also presented graphically in Figure 2, while Table II presentsthe MANOVA results.andP;  The analysis yielded three significant effects: a maineffect for color, a main effect for form of presentation, and an interactioneffect between form and color.andP;  The graphical presentation of the means(Figure 2) gives a visual representation of the nature of the effects.andP;  Forthree of the four forms of presentation (pies, bars, and tables), colorimproved performance in terms of time.andP;  A second analysis was performed toinclude only data for pies, bars, and tables.andP;  The findings of this analysisconfirm that if the time data for lines is excluded, there exists a maineffect for color (p [is less than] .0001) and a main effect for form (p [isless than] .0000), but no interaction effect between the two (p [is lessthan] .7565).andP;  It is concluded that the overall interaction effect can bedirectly attributed to the performance deterioration of line graphs presentedin color.andM;Planned comparisons of the monocolor and multi-color treatments for all fourforms of presentation were analyzed.andP;  In the case of pies, bars, and tables,the color treatment significantly improved performance over the monotreatment in terms of time.andP;  The performance deterioration with line graphswas not significant at the .05 level.andM;Table III presents the cell means and standard deviations for the accuracydata.andP;  The accuracy means are presented graphically in Figure 3, while theMANOVA results are presented in Table IV.andP;  The MANOVA on the accuracy dataalso yielded three significant effects: a main effect for form ofpresentation, a main effect for color and an interaction effect between formand color.andP;  The graphical representation confirmed by planned comparisonsindicates that color significantly improves accuracy performance for piecharts and line graphs.andP;  However, bar charts result in high levels ofaccuracy performance for both mono and color treatments.andP;  Color did notimprove accuracy performance for bar charts.andM;Tables resulted in marked deterioration of performance in terms of accuracywhen presented in color.andP;  A comparison between the two means for tablesindicated that the difference is significant at the .05 level.andM;The graph of the means for the accuracy data also indicated another result.andO;With the mono treatments, there were significant differences in performance(p [is less than] .0000) among all forms presentation ranging from the lowestdegree of accuracy for pie charts (mean = .59) to the highest degree fortables (mean = .96).andP;  However, with the color treatments, the performancedifferences among the three graphical forms (pies, bars, and lines)disappear.andP;  Only the tables result in a significant difference in performance(see Table V).andP;  In terms of accuracy, this indicates the performanceadvantage that bar graphs have over the other graphical forms of presentationis nullified when the graphs are presented in color.andP;  The only form thatdecreases in performance accuracy when presented in color is the table.andM;FINDINGSandM;Graphical Presentations.andP;  From the analysis of the time data, it can beconcluded that color improves time performance for pie charts and bar graphs.andO;While the data for line graphs indicate a deterioration in time performancewith color, overall conclusions regarding the use of color in line graphs arenot appropriate since the difference between monocolor and multicolor lineswas not statistically significant.andM;Color also improved accuracy performance with graphical presentations for piecharts and line graphs, while it neither improved nor hindred performancewith bar graphs.andP;  Even though accuracy performance did not improve using bargraphs, accuracy was at a high level for both the monocolor and colortreatments.andP;  These high levels of accuracy indicate that the scale ofmeasurement of the dependent variable--percentage accuracy--may not besensitive enough to measure performance changes using bar graphs.andP;  It isdifficult to determine whether there is, in fact, no change in accuracyperformance with bar graphs at these levels of complexity, or whether themeasures are simply the result of a ceiling effect since percentage accuracycan never exceed 1.0.andM;Tabular Presentations.andP;  When information presentations were given in tabularform, time performance improved but accuracy performance deteriorated.andP;  Thesefindings are consistent with the literature regarding the use of color withalphanumeric data [7].andP;  As with search-and-locate tasks, the intorduction ofcolor interfered with the accuracy of information extraction using tables.andM;This study answers questions about using color in various forms of graphicalpresentations.andP;  A listing of the best choices for all forms of presentationbased on the findings of this study can be found in Table VI.andP;  Colorfacilitates quicker information acquisition from graphical and tabularpresentations.andP;  This faster extraction applies to all forms of presentationexcept line graphs.andM;Color allows information to be extracted more accurately from graphicalpresentations.andP;  It serves to nullify the performance advantage of bar graphsin terms of accuracy.andP;  Color as implemented in this study hinders performancein terms of accuracy when information is presented in tabular format.andM;However, the reader must be cautioned regarding the use of color with tables.andO;The tables in this study were designed to be directly analogous to the threegraphical forms of presentation to achieve a comparable measure ofinformation complexity.andP;  These tables were not amenable to current guidelinesfor the use of color with tables [27].andP;  Further research is neededspecifically in the appropriate use of color with tables before thesuperiority of monocolor tables for accuracy performance can be generalizedto all tables.andM;FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONSandM;Within PRIMIS graphics research, an important extension of this study will beto examine the effects of complexity, both information and questioncomplexity, as they interact with color.andP;  Empirical evidence from the humanfactors literature [5, 6, 8] can be extrapolated to predict that asinformation complexity increases, color would improve performance in terms oftime.andP;  Varying complexity would also determine where thresholds are for bothtime and accuracy beyond which color offers no improvement.andM;Other research [2, 13, 18] has stressed the importance of examiningperformance using business graphics in light of the task.andP;  Varying questioncomplexity would provided insight into issues involved with the task.andP;  Also,there may be questions that are part of an information extraction task thathave the same level of complexity as the question used in this experiment,but which are semantically different.andP;  Some questions, for example, may bemore typical of a particular environment, or more amenable to the use ofcolor.andP;  An examination of the qualitative differences among types ofquestions and how they are related to the use of color in informationextraction would provide further understanding of this task domain.andM;This study has also demonstrated the need to address the particular issues ofinformation extraction using tables.andP;  Current research regarding thedifferences between presenting information in graphical and tabular formatsdoes not address the issue of color stating that &quot;not enough work has beenperformed to provide the basis for constructing guidelines&quot; [17].andP;  Researchis needed to assess the ways in which color can assist the cognitiveprocessing of information using tables.andP;  Guidelines for the use of color withtables may be particularly applicable to larger tables with more rows andcolumns than those in this study.andP;  The measures of information complexity andquestion complexity should address the issue of tables containing numerousrows and/or columns with complexity levels exceeding the highest levelscurrently under investigation.andP;  The use of color in tables can then bereassessed at these levels of complexity.andM;There are a number of other variables of interest that play an important rolein information extraction when color is involved.andP;  Shade, hue, brightness,contrast, and saturation are all components of color presentations which werecontrolled at moderate levels in this study.andP;  Of these, brightness andcontrast are directly controllable by the user in most computer environmentsas adjustments to the display.andP;  Design decisions regarding shade, hue, andsaturation may affect the user's ability to extract information from adisplay.andP;  This points out the importance of further theory-based research toguide designers and generally advance the field of MIS.andM;CONCLUSIONSandM;The results of this study support the view that the uncritical addition ofcolor to displays may not be uniformly beneficial.andP;  Color is a subtlevariable that can significantly enhance the decision maker's ability toextract information.andP;  In addition to answering questions relevant to the useof color in business graphics, this study has operationalized color in thecontext of a group of related experiments.andP;  This is an important step towardthe development of a theory of information presentation.andM;REFERENCESandM;[1] Addo, T.B.A.andP;  Development of a valid and robust metric for measuringquestion complexity in computer graphics experimentation.andP;
