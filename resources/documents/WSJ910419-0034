After three days of talks, the bulk of which was taken upby negotiations over the islands, both sides claimed to havemade modest progress, but agreed that there was nobreakthrough. &quot;Everything is still ahead of us,&quot; Mr.Gorbachev told a late-night news conference.</LP><TEXT>   The continuing impasse over the islands, which the SovietUnion occupied at the end of World War II and which Japansays must be returned, means that relations between the twoneighbors are likely to remain uneasy. Mr. Gorbachev hadhoped that his visit to Tokyo, the first by a Soviet leader,would end decades of mistrust between the two nations andclear the way for a much-needed injection of Japaneseeconomic assistance.   In what Soviet officials described as a show of good will,Mr. Gorbachev offered to reduce Soviet troop strength on theislands and allow Japanese citizens to visit without visas.But Tokyo stuck fast to its position that Moscow shouldacknowledge Japan's sovereignty over all four islands --known as the South Kuriles in the Soviet Union and as theNorthern Territories in Japan. A senior Japanese ForeignMinistry official told reporters that the issue had to firstbe resolved before Tokyo would agree to provide anylarge-scale assistance.   All questions of economic aid, he said, &quot;will be dependenton how seriously the Soviets' attitude to the territorialquestion is reflected in ensuing negotiations.&quot;   The four islands, north of Hokkaido, are the last majorobstacle to conclusion of a World War II peace treaty betweenthe two nations that would mark a full normalization ofrelations. A joint communique at the end of the talks spokeof &quot;the primary importance of accelerating work on a peacetreaty.&quot; But the Soviets rejected any mention of a specifictimetable, which Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu haddemanded.   The talks, however, weren't a total failure; Japaneseofficials expressed satisfaction that the final communiquespecifically named the four islands -- Habomai, Shikotan,Kunashiri and Etorofu -- as the key issue yet to be resolved.In the past, the Soviet Union had rejected the idea that theislands dispute in any way affected bilateral relations.   Japan said Moscow had agreed to hand over two of theislands in 1956, when the two nations restored diplomaticrelations, but rescinded the offer when Japan and the U.S.renewed a security treaty five years later. Mr. Gorbachevmade clear he no longer considers the offer valid.   &quot;We aren't in a position 30 years later to revivesomething that was missed in the past,&quot; he told the newsconference.   Failure to resolve the islands problem is likely todisappoint Japan, which expected Mr. Gorbachev to bring abold initiative with him on the issue. But Japan's hopes mayhave been too high, considering Mr. Gorbachev's precariousposition at home. Both hard-liners who now dominate theKremlin and many reform-minded Soviets oppose returning theterritory, and the islanders themselves overwhelmingly votedagainst any such move in a recent referendum.   The Soviet leader apparently thought he could mend fenceswith Japan without tackling the central issue. He expressedirritation at his news conference about Tokyo's insistence onreturn of the territory, saying, &quot;The Soviet Union and Japanhave wasted a lot of time issuing preconditions andpresenting iron-clad positions.&quot;   He suggested that Moscow and Tokyo should first expandtheir economic, political, cultural and social ties. &quot;Then itwill be easier to find answers to all questions.&quot;   During the negotiations with Prime Minister Kaifu and atthe news conference, Mr. Gorbachev drew parallels to recentevents in Germany. The Soviet Union had agreed to theunification of Germany only after Bonn and Moscow hadestablished much deeper ties, he said.   But Japan has been only lukewarm to such an approach,rejecting closer contacts until the islands issue isresolved.   The Japanese Foreign Ministry official did hint, however,that Tokyo is softening its stance. In the final communique,the two sides agreed &quot;on the need to further deepen anddevelop practical relations . . . in various fields,&quot;including trade, science, transportation and culture.   A package of 15 documents signed at the conclusion oftalks gave some clue as to how far Tokyo is prepared to go inthe absence of a peace treaty. They include protocols thatwould provide Japanese training for Soviet managers, increasethe air traffic between the countries, do joint archeologicalresearch and provide Japanese medical assistance to Sovietsaffected by the nuclear accident at Chernobyl in 1986.   For its part, Moscow promised to tend the graves of 60,000Japanese prisoners of war who died in Siberia in the late1940s and 1950s. After years of denials that Moscow had anyinformation on the subject, Mr. Gorbachev even presented Mr.Kaifu with a list of the dead POWs.</TEXT></DOC>
