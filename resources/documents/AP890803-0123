RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An American Bar Association committee thatincludes former Nixon and Carter administration officials urgedCongress on Thursday to abandon efforts to outlaw desecration ofthe American flag.   The committee said the nation's commitment to freedom ofexpression will be damaged by any attempt to reverse a SupremeCourt ruling that Americans have a right to burn the flag as apolitical protest.   ``All through human history, tyrannies have tried to enforceobedience by prohibiting disrespect for the symbols of theirpower,'' the task force said. ``The American flag commands respectand love because of our country's adherence to its values and itspromise of freedom, not because of fiat and criminal law.''   Headed by former Internal Renenue Service Commissioner RandolphThrower, an appointee of former President Nixon, the panel will askthe ABA's policy-making House of Delegates to endorse its reportnext week during a convention of the lawyers group in Honolulu.   The committee said that because Congress appears to be rushingtoward some action, the ABA should go on record now opposing eitherlegislation or a constitutional amendment to reverse the courtruling.   Lawyers have ``a special obligation to defend the Constitutionand its cardinal principles,'' the task force said.   ``We agree that the burning of the American flag as a form ofpolitical protest is very offensive to the vast majority of ourcitizens,'' the panel said. But, ``it is just when people takegreat offense because of disrespect shown to an honored symbol thatthe right of free expression needs protection, not prosecution.''   The Bush administration and leading Republicans in Congresssupport a constitutional amendment that would permit states tooutlaw flag desecration. Democratic leaders in Congress aresponsoring legislation to make flag desecration a crime.   The Senate Judiciary Committee is conducting hearings on theproposals and the House could vote on one or more of the measuresafter it returns in September from its August recess.   The high court on June 21 ruled that Texas improperly prosecuteda man who burned the flag at a protest during the RepublicanNational Convention in Dallas in 1984. The ruling apparentlyinvalidated flag desecration laws of 48 states and the federalgovernment.   Other members of the ABA task force are Barbara Black, dean ofColumbia University Law School; Warren Christopher, deputysecretary of state under former President Carter; Erwin Griswold,former dean of Harvard Law School and solicitor general in theNixon administration; Prof. Gerald Gunther of Stanford UniversityLaw School; Robert McKay, former dean of New York Univrsity LawSchool; Earl Silbert, a U.S. attorney appointed by Nixon and CyrusVance, former secretary of state under Carter.   In a separate development, Griswold and Norman Dorsen, presidentof the American Civil Liberties Union, announced the formation of a20-member committee opposed to the amendment. Charles Fried, aprofessor of law at Harvard who was solicitor general in the Reaganadministration, is co-chairman with them.   ``The First Amendment embodies this nation's strong commitmentto free expression,'' the committee said in a statement. ``It hasstood for nearly 200 years as a guardian against governmentcensorship or limitation of vigorous public debate. We disagreewith any effort to restrict the First Amendment by constitutionalamendment.''   Griswold said at a news conference that he is also opposed toefforts to overturn the court's decision by adopting a statute,because he does not believe one could be enacted that wouldwithstand consttitutional challenges in court.   Other members of the committee, called the Emergency Committeeto Defend the First Amendment, include Derek Bok, president ofHarvard University; Benjamin Civiletti, attorney general in theCarter administration; William T. Coleman Jr., secretary oftransportation in the Nixon administration; Lloyd N. Cutler, WhiteHouse counsel in the Carter administration; Hanna H. Gray,president of the University of Chicago, and Benno Schmidt Jr.,president of Yale University.</TEXT></DOC>
