 As it finishes itsvast telecom network, and crams it with vast computer intelligence, itwrestles with an inevitable question.andP;  What should I be when I grow up?andM;The question is relevant since it now has the money, the service &quot;smarts,&quot;the marketing ability, the technology, the largest digital network in NorthAmerica, and the enthusiasm (average age of its 17,500 employees is 31) toredefine the long distance business.andM;Should it become a telecom equipment maker?andP;  An owner of one of more regionalBell operating companies?andP;  A value-added long distance operator processingother people's information?andP;  Or a provider of the information it carries andprocesses (e.g.andP;  become a broadcaster)?andM;These questions spell out MCI's major options.andP;  Little known fact: MCI was a&quot;quiet partner&quot; in Ted Turner's failed bid to buy CBS.andP;  And MCI's stillobsessed with what it sees as synergisms between that it does (namely carryinformation) and &quot;media&quot; -- films, TV, broadcasting, magazines, books, etc.andM;As to the options, manufacturing is out because MCI is now a big enough buyerfor the world's leading manufacturers to design to its tastes.andP;  Manufacturingis nowhere as profitable as long distance, or value-added long distance.andP;  Sowhy bother?andM;Buying Bell operating companies is an obvious alternative -- a way toalleviate the 45.2% of MCI's revenues siphoned off in &quot;access&quot; fees to localphone companies.andM;Yet that alternative is out (at least for the moment), since MCI doesn't wantregulators to get the message it's OK for a local phone company to be in longdistance.andP;  They're excluded from it today.andM;In 1990, MCI will invest $750 million in its network and its computers, andthrow off about $700 million in space cash.andP;  So, the world has become thecompany's oyster...andM;It's the mid-1990s.andP;  You're looking on your desk.andP;  Disaster has struck.andO;There are no paper clips.andP;  You call an 800 number.andP;  It's MCI's (though youdon't know it at the time.)andM;A computerized voice answers: &quot;Hullo, John.andP;  Thanks for calling Ginzustationery.andP;  Would you like your order billed to your usual Visa card?&quot;andM;You answer: &quot;Yes.&quot;andP;  The voice response machine has recognized your phonenumber and programmed itself to recognize your voice.andP;  It walks you throughyour order.andP;  Where it can't recognize your responses, it asks you totouchtone your order in.andM;Your order is complete.andP;  &quot;Thanks.andP;  Your credit card checks out.andP;  You'll haveyour package within six working days.andP;  Bye.&quot;andP;  Click.andM;A few moments later, a thousand miles away in Kansas City, two computerprinters start up.andP;  A clerk tears a picking slip off one and a shipping labeloff the other.andP;  A robot-packed box comes sailing by.andP;  The clerk slaps on thelabel and the picking slip in a &quot;packing slip enclosed&quot; envelope.andM;MCI's computer is now talking to Visa's computer.andP;  Within seconds, your Visacard has a $150 charge on it, ready for next month's billing and Visa's bankhas wired (via MCI) $144 to Ginzu's Kansas City bank.andP;  That's $150 less the4% fees.andM;Meantime, MCI Mail is compiling statistics on the day's sales andprofitability, ready for forwarding early next morning (via MCI Mail) toGinzu's headquarters in Chicago.andM;A month later, MCI sends you a friendly MCI Mail message suggesting you'rerunning out of paper clips and it's time to buy again.andP;  If you don't respond,MCI's outdial telephone computers will call you and an agent will ask youyour stationery needs.andP;  He'll try to convince you a regular monthly order(with full refund privileges) &quot;is the best way to avoid the hassle of runningout of stationery, restocking at the last minute,&quot; etc.andM;In this scenario, MCI emerges as the country's biggest mail order processor,with several major benefits:andM;1.andP;  It now owns a massive database of the buying habits of millions ofAmericans.andM;2.andP;  Reselling the database in a myriad of specialized ways to specializedmanufacturers and resellers is now the most profitable part of MCI'sbusiness, far exceeding the margins on long distance.andM;3.andP;  It now owns one of the biggest transaction processing computer/telecomnetworks in the world.andM;It has also transformed retailing.andP;  Your favorite store is as close as yourtelephone.andM;Two major forces are operating on MCI, according to Richard Liebhaber,executive vice president:andM;1.andP;  Enormously improving price performance.andP;  In 1984, the capital cost(investment) to construct a 64 kilobit channel from Washington, DC, to NewYork was $1,000 per circuit mile.andM;In 1989, MCI is adding 64 kilobit channels for 83 cents a circuit mile!andO;That's a three orders of magnitude reduction in five years.andM;Says Liebhaber, &quot;this is effectively taking the concept of distance out oflong distance communications.andP;  We are seeing the postalization of thetransmission plant.andP;  Now we can begin to talk about cost per minute anywhere,not cost per mile, as we do today.andP;  If it's weekday peak, it's $10 an hourfrom anywhere to anywhere.andP;  If it's Saturday evening, it's $5 an hour.andP;  Inthe old days you worried about distance when you optimized networks.andP;  Now nomore.&quot;andM;2.andP;  Great intelligence layered on our network.andP;  MCI now has more than 1,000MIPS of general-purpose computing power additional to, and unrelated to whatit needs to switch cals.andP;  MIPS are millions of instructions per second.andP;  Theyare a measure of computer power.andM;Says Liebhaber, &quot;One third of MCI's capital spending is on addingintelligence and function to the network.andP;  We are adding general purposecomputers -- everything from IBM 3090s to ubiquitous DEC 8700s.andP;  There aretwo reasons I prefer general purpose computers:andM;&quot;A, they're cheap.andP;  More DEC 8700s are made in one month than NorthernTelecom makes DMS-100s in a year.andM;&quot;B, if I implement our new software in telephony machines the vendor wants meto pay for its development, retain the software and then wants to lease it tomy competitors!andP;  Not so with general purpose computers.&quot;andM;Says Liebhaber, &quot;I'm using switches to do what switches do well -- set up andtake down calls.andP;  All the integration and translation for advanced functions,I do in my general purpose computer machinery, my slick DEC machines that arecommodity priced and for which software is available and/or easily written.andM;&quot;As a result, I do not view my network as a network, i view it as atransaction processor.&quot;andM;In-WATS 800 lines are the classic &quot;intelligent network&quot; service.andP;  You dial an800 number.andP;  The network shunts you to a humongous database lookuptable/translation service.andP;  What's the &quot;real&quot; number?andP;  MCI changes the dialednumber and sends it on its way.andM;When you call 800-999-0345 (our MCI In-WATS number), MCI's database willchange the number to 212-473-0729 and dial that number.andM;Once you add intelligence to the 800-network and open it up, you can do somespectacular things.andP;  Within several months MCI salespeople will walk intoyour office with a laptop computer, order your 800 line on-line and place atest call from your office to your new 800 line before they leave.andM;Soon you can get into that database.andP;  You can now program in your own 800features and change them at will from your own laptop, or desktop.andP;  Your 800number will ring in New York from 9 to 5.andP;  In Los Angeles it will ring from 5to 9, except on alternate weeks and when the moon is full.andP;  But when thetraffic exceeds 1,500 calls per hour, both places will ring.andM;Better yet.andP;  Send out a catalog.andP;  Be overwhelmed with orders.andP;  Order up 15more instant 800 In-WATS lines.andP;  Kill the lines when you don't need them.andM;Suddenly, you have real ability to traffic engineer your own In-WATS network.andO;You now have statistics on what's happening in the network before it reachesyour ACD.andM;Similarly, you can monitor usage on your outbound lines and your credit cardson a moment-to-moment basis, shutting them off, turning up new ones,fine-tuning, etc.andM;MCI is now developing the ability to process two things -- transactions (seeexample above) and phone calls.andP;  Processing phone calls means a massiveintelligent and transparent network able to switch calls backwards andforwards across the country to numbers bearing no relation to the number thecaller originally dialed -- but bearing direct relation to the person,company or service the caller needs to solve his/her problem.andP;  Simpleexamples:andM;* Dealer or service center locator.andP;  Dial an 800 number.andP;  MCI figures whereyou are, based on your phone number, and switches you to your nearest serviceshop.andM;* Talking phone book.andP;  Dial an 800 number.andP;  A voice response machine answers.andO;It asks you to punch in the name via the numbers on your phone.andP;  MCI'sartificial intelligence program figures which name you want or asks youenough questions to figure it out.andP;  Once you've okayed the number, it dialsthe number and connects you.andM;* Selling classified ads.andP;  See a car ad in the local paper.andP;  Call an 800number, punch in some digits.andP;  If the car isn't sold, call the classified adplacer and ask if they'd like to extend the ad.andM;* Selling rock concert tickets.andP;  Call an MCI 900 number.andP;  For 50 cents youhear the concert schedule.andP;  Then a MCI voice processor asks: &quot;Which citywould you like tickets to?andP;  Dial 1 for New York, 2 for LA, 3 for Chicago.andO;Punch in your Visa card number.andP;  Thanks...andP;  Our records show you're at 12West 21 Street, New York, is that correct?...andP;  Would you like the ticketsmailed there?...andP;  Thanks for your purchase.andP;  The 50 cent charge for your 900call has now been applied to the cost of the tickets.andP;  This call is now free.andO;Thanks.&quot;andM;Two weeks before each concert, MCI routes the call to the local city's boxoffice.andP;  It's now too late to mail tickets out from a central place.andM;Next time your 800 line rings, the first thing you'll hear will be a bunch oftouchtone bleeps.andP;  These sounds will tell you the phone number of the personcalling you.andM;With that number, you can look it up on your database and bring up thehistory of your customer's buying.andP;  Your operator can now answer, &quot;Goodmorning, Mr. Newton.&quot;andP;  You'll also be able to route the call to the correctplace.andP;  All the insurance claims from Maryland will go to the Marylandopertor, unless he's busy, in which case it goes to the Colorado operator.andM;One large 800-line user figures knowing the calling number will shave anaverage of 20 seconds off each call.andP;  MCI will be all ANI by 1990.andM;Best thing about ANI, according to Liebhaber, is opportunities it will bringto outside VARs (value added resellers).andP;  &quot;If I were in that business I'dtake the incoming in-band messages and create applications on PCs, on LANs,on minis, on mainframes.andP;  This will be a massive software opportunity forpeople who understand telephony.&quot;andM;Says Liebhaber, as ISDN comes along with its huge increase in incomingmessages, VARs and VADs will be as important to the telecom carriers (localand long distance), as they are to data processing makers today.andM;MCI already has distributors.andP;  (Perhaps we should call them apprentice VARs?)andO;They include Amway dealers, American Express, Visa, payphone companies,hotels, motels and hospitals.andM;MCI's 17,500 employees send each other 400,000 MCI Mail messages a week.andP;  Todo that, they use 22,000 terminals.andP;  There are more terminals in MCI thanthere are people.andP;  (There are also 154 LANs and 7,500 PCs.)andM;You can now use MCI Mail to send fax, or telexes.andP;  You can dial into MCI Mailfrom Australia (and umpteen other countries).andP;  MCI Mail is now the biggestinternational electronic mail, message, telex and fax provider.andM;There are MCI Mail Scripts.andP;  Dial up.andP;  Get a form on screen.andP;  Fill in theform (for example, an order form).andP;  Send the data, but not the form.andP;  Savetransmission.andM;We haven't scratched what we may see: your MCI phone bill delivered via MCIMail.andP;  If you're a hotel, you'll have it within seconds of your guest hangingup.andP;  Customized database information retrieved and delivered.andP;  Even jobsearches and job matching.andM;As 800 In-WATS customer calling ID spells opportunity to one form of VARS, soMCI Mail (or whatever its new name) will be to another form of telecomvalue-added VARs.andM;Saturday Night Live forever changed the way intellectual services aredelivered in the US when it asked its viewers to call a 900 number to letLarry the Lobster live or die.andM;900 numbers charge the caller for the call.andP;  800 numbers charge the calledcompany.andP;  Sample 900 services: software support, stock quotes, insurancepolicies priced out, mortgage rates and financial services, charitydonations, medical and legal advice, etc.andM;Sadly, 900 numbers haven't developed as they should.andP;  Today, local phonecompanies do all the billing.andP;  Their cut, like their local access charges, isvery steep.andP;  Too steep.andM;But bypass, in the form of ANI, is coming to 900 services.andP;  Combine ANI withcredit card database lookup and intelligent voice response units and yousuddenly have the wherewithal to overcome the 900 industry's biggest problem-- collecting the money.andM;Lands Ends customer files are indexed by credit cards.andP;  Your MCI Credit cardmay soon be your VISA Credit Card.andP;  Dial a 900 number, buy information andproducts.andP;  Dial it, have it &quot;Thank You.&quot;andP;  You've bought a set of Ginzuknives, an airline ticket, the latest Robert Ludlum novel, etc., in fiveseconds.andP;  Totally automatic.andM;This business has real potential.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
