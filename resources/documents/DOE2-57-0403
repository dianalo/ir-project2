The linking of salt transportthrough the mesophyll to abaxial salt excretion was investigated usingenergy dispersive X-ray analysis and ATPase cytochemistry. The role ofsalt excretion in maintaining growth-favourable salt and water balancesin euhalophytic species is discussed in terms of the pathways and mechanismsof salt excretion suggested for Avicennia marina. To enable analysisof surface structures such as stomata, trichomes were shaved from thefresh leaf immediately prior to analysis. Specimens were examined uncoatedin a Jeol SSm 35 scanning electron microscope. The attached KEVEX/supR/ energy dispersive X-ray analyser was used for ion localization studies.</TEXT></DOC>
