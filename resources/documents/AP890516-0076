It was by far the largest gathering so far in Tiananmen Square,where crowds stopped traffic on a six-lane avenue and nearlysurrounded the adjacent Great Hall of the People, which wasprotected by hundreds of troops and police.   Embarrassing China's Communist leaders, the protesters _ about3,000 of them on a hunger strike since Saturday _ have refused toleave the square during the first Sino-Soviet summit in 30 years.The added attention from Mikhail S. Gorbachev's visit seems to haveencouraged them.   A scheduled meeting in the Great Hall between Gorbachev andChina's Premier Li Peng was hastily moved to the state guest houseabout 3 miles away as entrances to the hall were clogged withstudents and onlookers.   Because of the student occupation, officials already had to movethe official welcoming ceremony for Gorbachev from the 100-acresquare on Monday and cancel a wreath-laying ceremony today.   ``Government _ how long will you allow the students to starve?''read a banner carried by journalists of the conservative state-runGuangming Daily, one of thousands of red-and-white banners loftedby marchers.   More than 350 hunger strikers had been hospitalized sufferingfrom dehydration and exposure by late today, although some laterreturned after treatment. A steady stream of ambulances withflashing blue lights entered the square.   Observers estimated today's crowd at more than 300,000, by farthe largest crowd since pro-democracy demonstrations broke out onApril 15.   The students want democratic reform, chiefly a free press, butanother condition for ending the hunger strike is a governmentapology for an April 26 newspaper editorial that accused them ofplotting against the state.   A top party official, Yan Mingfu, addressed the students in aspeech over loudspeakers and said that he supported their demands.But he said the government needed more time to consider them andurged the students to leave. Fasting students took a hasty vote anddecided to remain in the square.   Protest groups from at least eight newspapers, emboldened by thestudents' demand for freedom of the press, joined the march on thesquare. Another group of 800 from the Chinese Academy of SocialSciences was led by a trumpeteer.   ``We are giving the government a push toward a more democraticstate,'' said Zhang Yong, who reads the nightly English-languagenewscast on nationwide television.   Zhang, who wore sunglasses and handed out autographs, said hiscolleagues were ``very, very embarrassed'' by coverage of theprotests censored by officials.   Workers, including factory laborers and coal miners, wereprominent in the crowds, and employees of at least three governmentministries also participated.   ``I saw them (the students) passing by and ... I knew I had tojoin them,'' said one worker who refused to give his name.   ``We want the right to strike,'' said Song Lou, a teacher at theWorkers' Movement Institute.   One group of 60 museum workers dramatically entered the squarefrom underneath the huge portrait of Mao Tse-tung that hangs abovethe gate to the adjacent Forbidden City, once home to China'semperors.   They carried a huge yellow banner reading, ``Forbidden Cityworkers'' and chanted, ``Democracy, democracy.''   At least 1,000 students also took to the streets in Shanghaitoday in support of the hunger strikers in Beijing, an Americanteacher in the city said.   On Tiananmen Square, more than 1,000 medical students anddoctors set up an emergency tent amid the sprawled bodies of thehunger strikers and administered glucose and salt waterintraveneously to fainting fasters.   ``We can handle 10 at a time,'' said one medical student.   Twelve students had decided last night to stop drinking water.``They are terrible. They are lying on ice'' to keep them cool, adoctor said. Two had fainted by late afternoon.   The number of hunger strikers also grew as more people,including some teachers pledged abstinence until their demands fora dialogue with the government and democratic reforms are realized.   Students said the strike could go on indefinitely if the numbersof participants continues to grow.   The city's emergency medical center sent aspirin and othermedication for the students. Almost every hospital in the city wasinvolved.   ``If they are wise the government will give way,'' a doctor said.   One of the strikers, Mao Shijing, a philosophy graduate studentat Beijing Normal Univiersity, said, ``sometimes I have a littlepain, sometimes I'm dizzy. Yesterday I stood up too fast and Ifainted. By night it's cold and by day it's hot. The worst thing ofall is the sun beating down on us.''   Students who have been collecting contributions fromsympathizers bought umbrellas and hats for the strikers.   The students are demanding recognition of their independentlyformed organizations and a dialogue with the government on suchissues as press freedom and official corruption.   The government has agreed to talk to representatives of officialstudent groups, but maintains that the student activist groups areillegal.</TEXT></DOC>
