We analyze multiplephase-shift PSDFB lasers by solving numerically the coupled-wave equations.Our results show that the use of even two phase-shift regions can substantiallyreduce the axial inhomogeneity of the mode intensity. Although the gainmargin is generally reduced by the use of multiple phase shifts, it isstill large enough for most practical purposes if the phase shifts aresuitably optimized.</TEXT></DOC>
