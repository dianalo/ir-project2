Lawmakers voted 49-47 to adopt the Democratic aid plan after turning aside a competing Republican plan that included military supplies that had been purchased earlier but hadn't been delivered when authority for military aid ended Feb. 29.    No Republican senator voted for the Democratic plan. Sens. Brock Adams of Washington, John Melcher of Montana, Patrick Leahy of Vermont and William Proxmire of Wisconsin were the only Democrats to vote against it. The 59-37 vote against the GOP plan also generally followed party lines.    The package was made part of the Senate's $282.6 billion Pentagon spending bill, which must be reconciled with the House-passed version. The House measure doesn't provide any aid to the rebels, known as the Contras.    The plan was carefully crafted by Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd to give Senate Democrats, who are widely split on the issue, a Contra-aid plan most of them could vote for just days before the Republican National Convention. It denies the immediate shipment of weapons and ammunition, satisfying those who oppose military aid, but sets the stage for a vote on resuming those deliveries, satisfying those who want to keep pressure on the Nicaraguan government.    Sen. Byrd (D., W.Va.) had hoped to win bipartisan support for the package, but nearly a week of negotiations with Senate Republicans and the Reagan administration came to naught. Just before the vote on the Democratic plan, White House officials said they couldn't support it.    &quot;We have given, and given, and given, and given,&quot; a tired and frustrated Mr. Byrd angrily told his colleagues. &quot;I'm sick and tired of dealing with a White House that has no more steel in its gut than this White House has.&quot;    The food, clothing, shelter and medical supplies would be delivered by the U.S. Agency for International Development from Oct. 1, when current aid ends, through March 31. In addition, the $5 million would be given to the Roman Catholic Church in Nicaragua for the medical care of civilians wounded in the seven-year civil war.    Under the package, President Reagan this year could ask Congress to release $16.5 million of the undelivered military supplies if he finds that two of three conditions exist: an unprovoked attack by the Sandinistas on the Contras, blatant violations of the Sandinistas' agreement to move toward a democracy, and military shipments to Nicaragua from Soviet-bloc nations.    But the Senate-passed plan would require that the request first be approved by the House, which has been opposed to resuming military aid, before the Senate could consider it. House Speaker James Wright (D., Texas), an ardent critic of Mr. Reagan's Central American policies, has promised swift action on a presidential request, but has indicated that Democrats would probably offer an alternative aid plan.    The provision for a second vote ensures that the question of military assistance for the Contras will be before Congress next month, as the presidential campaign gathers momentum.    While considering the Pentagon spending bill, the Senate voted to include its version of the defense authorization measure Mr. Reagan vetoed last week, largely because of House-passed arms-control language. In his veto message, the president said the Senate's authorization bill was acceptable.    Lawmakers from the House and Senate again will try to work out a compromise that Mr. Reagan would sign. To increase their legislative maneuverability, senators also plan to again pass a separate Pentagon authorization bill, which defines the programs the government may carry out and sets spending ceilings for them.    The Senate also adopted on a voice vote an amendment offered by Sen. Sam Nunn (D., Ga.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. The amendment would designate $103 million to keep in service for drug-interdiction efforts eight of the 16 Navy frigates Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci wants to retire.    Also yesterday, the Senate passed on a voice vote a $633 million spending bill to meet unanticipated federal costs for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30. The measure would shift $45.4 million within the Agriculture Department for the expected costs of processing applications from farmers for drought relief. The measure also includes $498.1 million for the Veterans Administration, which needs more money for certain inflation-adjusted benefits.    The House-passed version of the measure doesn't include the VA funds. A House-Senate conference committee hopes to reconcile differences between the two bills today so that the House and Senate can ratify the compromise and send it to President Reagan, who is expected to sign it. </TEXT></DOC>
