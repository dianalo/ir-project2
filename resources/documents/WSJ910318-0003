Marian Houghton is content to cover this prettylittle town and its 5,000 residents like a blanket.   Chronicler of Grange and VFW meetings, antiquarian teasand bean suppers, the 78-year-old feature writer for theJaffrey-Rindge Chronicle got her start in the news businessjust six years ago. But she is fast making up for lost time.</LP><TEXT>   Open the 1,500-circulation weekly Chronicle, and there isMarian Houghton's byline splashed all over the front page,and most pages that follow. Her column, &quot;Ear to the Ground&quot;is on the editorial page -- and another column containstidbits she collects while gathering other news. And don'tforget the photo credits: Mrs. Houghton fills the Chroniclewith snapshots of local doings, taken with a Vivitarautomatic slung on a chain around her neck.   &quot;I try to limit myself to 10 stories a week plus thecolumns,&quot; she says, stressing that she's a part-timer.   It is only a few miles from Jaffrey to Peterborough, N.H.,immortalized as Grover's Corners in Thornton Wilder's &quot;OurTown.&quot; In these parts, a line from that play is as true todayas it ever was: &quot;In our town we like to know the facts abouteverybody.&quot;   To that end, Mrs. Houghton says, &quot;I listen. I keep my eyesopen and my ears flappin'.&quot; Jaffrey fairly crackles withnews: not the sort that shakes the world, perhaps, but ratherthe homely routines and rituals that stitch a communitytogether.   Townsfolk are forever calling her with tips, or stuffingpress releases in her mailbox. &quot;They say Marian, I've got ahot lead for you,&quot; she says, &quot;when sometimes it's so lukewarmthat you wish they hadn't wakened you.&quot; Like the night thestable called to report that a horse had kicked over thecarriage it was pulling, injuring a passenger. But by then,the horse had run off and there was nothing to photograph buta broken horseshoe. &quot;I wasn't goin' out for that at 7 o'clockat night]&quot; she says, still indignant.   When she was 72 and working as a saleswoman at a localarts and crafts shop, Mrs. Houghton got her big break. TheState Line News in Winchendon, Mass., offered her the job ofJaffrey correspondent. (The paper subsequently became theJaffrey-Rindge Chronicle, and now is part of the WorcesterCounty Newspapers chain.) Mrs. Houghton was recruited morefor her longstanding roots in the community than for provenjournalistic skill; though she had once written radiocommercials, she had never before tackled a news story oroperated a camera. But she rose to the challenge, dictatingher own terms from the start.   Finding it &quot;degrading&quot; to be paid by the column inch (10cents an inch, 12 cents if she made the front page), she heldout for a salary. She insists on working out of her homerather than making the 20-minute drive each day to thepaper's Winchendon editorial offices. Nor will she covernight meetings in winter if roads are slippery. &quot;And I won'tchase ambulances,&quot; she says. &quot;The only thing we'd gain is metaking a grisly picture, and I don't think that's fair to theperson, dead or alive.&quot;   Otherwise, she keeps a schedule that would exhaust many acub reporter. Donning Reeboks on a recent icy morning, sheheads out with briefcase in hand for the Jaffrey GrammarSchool, where a preliminary heat of the National GeographicSociety's &quot;geography bee&quot; is in progress. A fifth-grader ispuzzling over this question: &quot;What four-legged animal is usedby the Indians of the Andes as a beast of burden?&quot; &quot;Acrocodile?&quot; he ventures shakily. Mrs. Houghton snaps thecontestants' picture in front of a map, and is on to her nextappointment: St. Patrick's School, where they are celebratingNational Catholic School Month.   Before heading for her afternoon assignment, a profile ofthe drama director at nearby Franklin Pierce College, Mrs.Houghton sits in her Dodge Omni and, as is her custom, writesup the morning's items on the fly. &quot;That way,&quot; she says, &quot;Icome home with three stories ready to put on the wordprocessor.&quot;   Evenings, she usually mulls over her column in herLa-Z-Boy recliner. These range from humorous family anecdotes(a widow, she has six children, 10 grandchildren and threegreat-grandchildren) to tart commentary on the passing scene.(Here she is on wearing a flattering new scarf: &quot;As I wentout the door, I heard 20 years drop with a thud behind me andI skipped down the path.&quot; In another, she describes abicyclist as wearing &quot;. . . parachute boots and sheer greenSpandex briefs, which exposed a shocking display of rearcleavage.&quot;)   Jaffrey doesn't lack for excitement. When an elderly localwoman broke her hip on a visit to Montreal, the operator ofthe Jaffrey airport invited Mrs. Houghton along to helpescort the woman home. She flew up and back the same day,delivering the invalid to a crowd of well-wishers waiting onthe Jaffrey runway and delivering a story for the front page.   Then there was the day the local fireworks factory blewup. Mrs. Houghton got to the scene ahead of the fire trucks.&quot;I made believe I was deaf to get by the cops,&quot; she says.   But don't look to Mrs. Houghton for scandal-mongering orsensationalism. &quot;Living alone, I don't want to get intothat,&quot; she says. &quot;I might find myself under the bed insteadof on it.&quot; She was just as happy to let others cover the townmeetings about a local teen-age Satanic cult (&quot;candles anddead cats,&quot; she says with a shudder). She did attend ameeting of the American Legion women's auxiliary where thepolice chief spoke on local crime. &quot;He told it like it was,&quot;Mrs. Houghton says. &quot;And those biddies almost dropped theirteeth.&quot; The chief's remarks, she adds, were &quot;too rough toprint.&quot;   During the 1988 presidential primary, when Sen. RobertDole made a swing through Jaffrey, Mrs. Houghton got toobserve the big-time media first-hand. &quot;I was walking intothe high school and someone said, `The press is upstairs,'&quot;she recalls. &quot;Well, there were the AP, the New York Times,and the TV people all piled in with their tripods, lights andvideo cameras. What a grubby bunch -- and the women just asbad as the men]&quot; She says she was &quot;too stunned&quot; to ask aquestion at the press conference, but she got the senator'spicture afterward.   Mrs. Houghton takes pains not to ruffle feathers locally-- though she admits that when friends see her coming theysay, &quot;Stop talking, here comes the snoop.&quot; Indeed, Jaffreyseems to embrace her precisely because she is so unlike theyapping news hounds they watch on TV. &quot;People trust her,&quot;says Martha O'Connor, the Chronicle's publisher. &quot;She coverswhat's really important in little New England towns.&quot;   Jaffrey innkeeper Barry Miller concurs, suggesting thatabrasive reporters would strike out with the locals here.&quot;They'd get the real Yankee `Can't say not knowin' response,&quot;he says. &quot;They wouldn't find out a thing.&quot;   Alfred P. Sawyer is one such &quot;damned, arrogant Yankee,&quot; ashe describes himself. His family settled in this area 13generations ago, and as Jaffrey's state representative, hisavowed purpose is &quot;to prevent legislation.&quot; As he guides ahorsedrawn sleigh through a snowy woods, he reflects onJaffrey and Marian Houghton's place in it. &quot;This town runssmoother than most,&quot; he says. &quot;It's so conservative thatthere's not a lot of muck for even reporters to find.&quot;   Maybe so, but there are 5,000 stories in this town, andMrs. Houghton is determined to ferret them out. &quot;Everybodyhas a story in their own funny way,&quot; she says. &quot;There'ssomething in there that they didn't know they had until youlet them talk.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
