John Martin, chief of molecular pathology at USC MedicalCenter, Los Angeles, says he found the virus in the cerebralspinal fluid of about 10 patients with severe neurologicalabnormalities that mimic problems associated with brainailments such as multiple sclerosis. Many people afflictedwith chronic fatigue syndrome suffer some unexplainedneurological problems. The virus, from a family known asspumaviruses, hadn't been previously linked to human disease.</LP><TEXT>   Chronic fatigue syndrome is characterized by severefatigue, muscle and joint pain, and often by suchneurological symptoms as loss of balance and coordination anddifficulty in arithmetic and in recalling words and phrases.It isn't known how many people suffer from the affliction.But individual symptoms vary widely and are similar to thoseof many other illnesses, making specific diagnosis difficult.   Some doctors and scientists have long been convinced thatsome infectious agent underlies the syndrome, but othersthink that while symptoms are real, patients suffer them as aresult of psychological problems, or some other yet-to-bediscovered cause. The disease has been derided as &quot;yuppieflu,&quot; because it appeared to strike well-educated men and,especially, women, in their 30s.   Disputes over diagnosis are also reflected in medicalresearch, where just looking for a cause of the ailment isextraordinarily controversial. Indeed, Dr. Martinacknowledges that three prominent medical journals havedeclined to publish his current data, even as a letter to theeditor. The data haven't yet been replicated by otherresearchers.   Dr. Martin presented his findings at a recent meeting ofchronic fatigue researchers in San Francisco. He will discussthem again next weekend with other scientists -- some of whompreviously reported evidence of a viral cause of the syndrome-- at a meeting at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control inAtlanta. One possible topic of discussion at the next meetingis whether researchers who appear to be considering differentviruses as a possible cause of the syndrome may actually belooking at the same one.   &quot;It's too early to say {a spumavirus} is a cause ofchronic fatigue syndrome,&quot; says Dr. Paul Cheney, a Charlotte,N.C., doctor who treats chronic fatigue patients and isfamiliar with Dr. Martin's work. But when considered in thecontext of other recent research, he says, &quot;it's a veryappealing {candidate} as a cause.&quot;   But other scientists say that even if Dr. Martin'sfindings are replicated, it isn't clear that his seriouslyill patients suffer from the syndrome as opposed to anatypical neurologic disease. Dr. Martin says he also foundevidence of the virus in about half of 300 patients diagnosedwith chronic fatigue syndrome -- some of whose symptomsaren't so serious. But he adds that he isn't ready to saydefinitely that all of those patients are infected with aspumavirus. In any event, finding a new viral cause of anyhuman illness would have important public healthimplications.   Many scientists investigating the syndrome say they arenow convinced that it reflects the immune system's responseto an invading infectious agent, possibly a virus. Theysuspect that the agent engages the immune system and keeps itfrom shutting down, with the resulting biological activityconsuming the body's energy at the molecular and cellularlevel. So far, experimental efforts to treat the disease havefocused on regulating the immune system, and results of atrial of a drug called Ampligen, which is believed tomodulate the immune system, are expected to be announced nextmonth.   If researchers can pinpoint a viral cause of the syndrome,Dr. Martin says, efforts would be launched to find ananti-viral treatment. Such a finding would also provide adefinitive means of diagnosing the disease, thus perhapsavoiding costly regimens of ineffective tests and treatments.   Dr. Martin said in an interview that the 10 seriously illpeople he tested were referred to him by such specialists aspsychiatrists, neurologists and rheumatoidologists. They hadbeen suspected of having such diseases as multiple sclerosis,lupus and encephalitis, but their symptoms didn't clearly fitthe classic definition of any of them. &quot;They get all types oftests and therapies and they won't get better. These are verysad stories of people groping for some kind of a diagnosisfrom a specialist,&quot; Dr. Martin says.   One reason other scientists may question whether his first10 patients are legitimate chronic fatigue patients, heasserts, is that chronic fatigue patients aren't usuallythought to be so sick. &quot;It's not a trivial illness,&quot; he says.&quot;We are dealing with something much more serious and complexthan the name implies.&quot;   Dr. Martin prefers a diagnosis such as myelagicencephalopathy, denoting disease of the brain and spinalcolumn, for such patients, a description that focuses on theillness's impact on the brain rather than the immune system.   He says the spumavirus was grown in culture in hislaboratory using cerebral spinal fluid extracted from theseriously ill patients.   From an additional 300 patients, mostly referrals fromthree doctors, including Dr. Cheney, who regularly treatchronic fatigue, the same test turned up positive in 160cases. A thorough analysis of those patients, Dr. Martinsays, hasn't been completed.   Dr. Cheney, who recently visited Dr. Martin's lab, sayshis referrals included patients with mild, moderate andsevere symptoms and that there wasn't any correlation betweenthose who tested positive for the virus and how sick theywere.   He says one question is whether the culture test used issensitive enough to find the virus in all cases. If it is,then a roughly 50% positive rate would indicate the virus isassociated, but not necessarily a cause of chronic fatigue.If a more sensitive test turns up a much higher positiverate, say 85% or more, it would suggest a spumavirus as acause.   Dr. Cheney says one factor pointing to causation is astudy published recently in the magazine Science by a Germanresearch team that injected mice with human spumavirus. Amongtheir findings, he says, was that the mice developed a lossof balance and coordination similar to that experienced bychronic fatigue patients.   Spumaviruses are one of a class of agents calledretroviruses. Other retroviruses include humanimmunodeficiency virus, or HIV, that causes AIDS.</TEXT></DOC>
