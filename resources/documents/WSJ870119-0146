The insurance commissioners of Arkansas and Indiana took over Baldwin's financially troubled annuity operations in 1983. Metropolitan previously was selected to offer new Metropolitan contracts to customers of the Indiana unit. The two Baldwin companies together have about 165,000 policyholders and assets of about $3.5 billion.    Arkansas county Judge Perry V. Whitmore indicated last fall that he intended to select Metropolitan over competing bidder Kaufman andamp; Broad Inc. In anticipation of the formal order that has just been issued, a spokeswoman for Kaufman andamp; Broad said that the Los Angeles-based housing and insurance concern intends to appeal. </TEXT></DOC>
