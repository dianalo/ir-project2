The maneuver by the nation's No. 1 steelmaker illustrates the growing competitiveness overseas for steel and other basic U.S. industries in the wake of the dollar's freefall against major currencies.    It also signals an emerging strategy at USX for coping with the next recession. When today's strong domestic market weakens in an economic downturn, the giant steel and energy concern hopes to offset lost steel volume through higher exports.    Named to head the long-dormant export unit -- U.S. Steel International Inc. -- was Giuseppe Colombari, a native of Italy. Mr. Colombari is currently senior vice president for USX's domestic and Canadian iron ore operations.    &quot;We think we can face the Japanese, the Germans, the French, even the British -- all the major steel-exporting nations in the world,&quot; Mr. Colombari said. &quot;The principle is to reestablish ourselves in the world export market to stay.&quot;    Mr. Colombari, whose appointment takes effect at year end, said USX initially is targeting developing nations with limited or no steel-making capacity, including Africa, South America and the Middle East. But he added that the steelmaker also hopes to export to industrialized areas, too, including Japan and Europe.    Steel exports at USX peaked in 1974, when the company was known as U.S. Steel Corp. That year the company exported roughly two million tons, or 10% of its total shipments. Mr. Colombari said he hopes within three years to reach that 10% threshold from today's almost negligible levels.    Economists and analysts differ on the company's prospects. One thing, though, is clear: While the falling dollar hasn't done much to stave off imports here, it has made steel exports far cheaper in foreign markets. Since the beginning of the year, the dollar has plummeted 18% against the yen and 15% against the West German mark, continuing a two-year decline.    American steel exports peaked in 1968 at 7.1 million tons, or about 7.8% of industry shipments that year. Exports steadily declined afterward, dipping under one million tons for each of the past three years. The bottom came in 1985 when domestic producers exported just 932,000 tons, or 1.3% of the 73 million tons shipped that year.    So far this year, steel exports have risen only modestly. Through October, exports totaled only 904,000 tons, compared with 765,000 tons during the same 10-month period in 1986. Some economists, though, say today's strong domestic demand masks the potential for a surge in exports in coming years.    &quot;There are wild possibilities here,&quot; says Peter F. Marcus, PaineWebber Inc.'s steel analyst. Mr. Marcus expects steel exports to jump as high as five million tons next year, and thinks USX may be moving to qualify its steel for major Japanese buyers, including its auto makers.    Still, some economists caution that exporting commodity-grade metal into the heart of mercantilist nations like Japan may be an uphill battle.    &quot;The dollar has fallen so sharply that we're very close to being able to export to Japan and make money,&quot; notes Donald Barnett, a former World Bank consultant. &quot;The problem, though, is that you may offer them an attractive price, yet be rejected because they're worried it's a one-shot deal or that they may disrupt long-term relationships with their original suppliers,&quot; he added, noting that low-cost South Korean exports are also meeting resistance.    Charles Stitt, a vice president of Armco Inc., the nation's No. 5 steelmaker, also agrees on the difficulty of cracking the Japanese market. &quot;We're selling only token tonnages or products they don't care to make themselves,&quot; said Mr. Stitt, who suspects that the Japanese accept some foreign steel &quot;to demonstrate that their markets are open.&quot;    Whatever barriers, USX is restarting its export business on a modest scale. The unit will initially employ a staff of just five, including Mr. Colombari. In the mid-1970s, the export group employed 300 people, plus another 50 overseas agents.    Thomas Graham, USX vice chairman, disbanded the unit in 1984 shortly after joining the steelmaker. Hurt by an overvalued dollar, the unit's sales were negligible. &quot;The prospects just weren't there for meaningful business,&quot; Mr. Graham recounted in an interview last week.    Customers won't greet the news with open arms. Some buyers, complaining about stretched-out delivery schedules and high prices, say they're convinced USX is already regularly diverting steel to foreign buyers even though unable to keep up with domestic demand.    USX denies such assertions. Officials say the company's only two significant sales this year were to Japan and Spain -- each totaling only 20,000 tons.    Other steelmakers are exploiting the falling dollar, too. Pittsburgh-based Allegheny Ludlum Corp., a maker of stainless steels, estimates that exports will account for 2.5% of its shipments this year, up from 1.5% last year. Armco meanwhile hopes to double its specialty steel exports over the next two years.    Steel executives pin the turnabout on the dollar's plunge. &quot;If somebody had told me at the beginning of the year that the yen would fall to 130 to the dollar, I would have asked them what they were smoking,&quot; said Mr. Graham. </TEXT></DOC>
