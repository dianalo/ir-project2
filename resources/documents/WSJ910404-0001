A Molson spokesman said the charge wouldn't have anyimpact on the company's brewing alliance with Fosters BrewingGroup Ltd., 38%-owned by Harlin. Harlin is controlled byAustralian John Elliott, Fosters Brewing's deputy chairman.</LP><TEXT>   Molson said it is taking the charge because of the&quot;uncertainty and the length of time likely to be involved inany recovery&quot; by Harlin, which has debt of roughly 3 billionAustralian dollars (US$2.33 billion). The brewer said itbelieves its investment could be recovered in the future, butthat this depends on &quot;the ongoing cooperation of Harlin'smajor creditors.&quot;   The charge, to be taken in Molson's fiscal year endedMarch 31, represents a write-down of its 6% equity investmentin Harlin, valued at A$50 million and a provision against theloss of 111 million Canadian dollars (US$96.1 million) inHarlin debt and accrued interest that Molson indemnified.   Molson said it plans to purchase the debt obligation fromthe lender, which it identified only as a North Americanfinancial institution. The debt is in the form of a note thatmatures Aug. 24, 1994. Interest on the note is accrued andpayable upon maturity.   The charge came as no surprise to analysts familiar withHarlin's financial situation. Martin Kaufman, at NesbittThomson Deacon Inc., said Molson has a &quot;very good chance&quot; ofrecovering its investment once Fosters Brewing completes itsplan to dispose of all its non-brewing assets and return theproceeds to shareholders.</TEXT></DOC>
