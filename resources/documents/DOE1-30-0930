<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-30-0930 </DOCNO><TEXT>Much of the second year of the grant has been devoted to refinishing thepreparative for the anions, CpFe(CO)(PPh{sub 3})COO{sup -}M{sup +} (M=Li,Na, K) and the corresponing calcium salt, and in the establishing thecharacteristic reactions of these compounds. All of the compounds havebeen isolated in good yields and characterized spectroscopically by IR(DRIFTS)and by {sup 1}H and {sup 13}C NMR. The IR spectral data indicate thateach salt is obtained as a hydrate; {sup 1}H NMR data confirm that. Tothis point we have been unsuccessful in obtaining x-ray quality crystalsfrom any of the salts (we are still trying). Preliminary communicationsregarding the improved preparation of CpFe(CO)(PPh{sub 3})COOH and itspotassim and lithium salts and some of the reactions of the salts havebeen published (or are in press). Reactions of the metallocarboxylateanions which have been studied to the present time are summarized.</TEXT></DOC>
