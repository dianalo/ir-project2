Bufe, chief financial officer of Goldome's Goldome Savings Bank unit, on fraud and stock manipulation charges.    The 10-count indictment accuses Mr. Bufe, 33 years old, and Florida banker Fred Langford, 62, of conspiring to inflate the earnings of Palmetto Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association in 1981. At the time, Mr. Bufe was Palmetto's controller and Mr. Langford was its president. When Goldome acquired the Palmetto, Fla.-based thrift in 1983, Mr. Bufe stayed on as chief financial officer. Mr. Langford left and now is chairman of Preferred Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, also in Palmetto.    The indictment charges that the two men engineered a series of sham real estate deals and other artificial transactions that enabled Palmetto to report net income of $1.2 million in 1981, when in fact the thrift had a loss that year. The indictment further alleges that the two misapplied Palmetto funds and later misled Goldome and thrift regulators about their actions and the condition of the thrift.    Through his attorney, Mr. Bufe &quot;vehemently&quot; denied any wrongdoing and said he intends to plead not guilty. A spokesman for Goldome, based in Buffalo, N.Y., said Mr. Bufe is still employed by the company. He said Goldome &quot;knew absolutely nothing&quot; of the alleged actions and declined to comment further. Mr. Langford, through an attorney, also denied any wrongdoing and said he'll plead not guilty, too.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Goldome shares closed at $3.50, unchanged. </TEXT></DOC>
