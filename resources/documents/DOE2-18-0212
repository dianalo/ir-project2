The maximumsubsidence over caved workings was generally not more than 60% of extractionthickness underground, while in the case of hydraulically sand stowedworkings it was generally not more than 5%. The relationships have beenuseful in extraction of more than 7-million tonne of coal from underneathand in the vicinity of surface properties.</TEXT></DOC>
