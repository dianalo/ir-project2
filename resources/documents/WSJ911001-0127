Kerrey Enters Presidential Race,   Echoing Theme of Generational Change   ----   By Dennis Farney   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>10/01/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A22</SO><IN>BIOGRAPHY (BIO)</IN><NS>BIOGRAPHY (BIO)POLITICS (PLT)</NS><GV>CONGRESS (CNG)</GV><RE>NORTH AMERICA (NME)UNITED STATES (US)</RE><LP>   LINCOLN, Neb. -- Democrat Bob Kerrey launched hispresidential bid -- an experiment in the politics ofgenerational change -- with a pledge to &quot;build for greatnessagain.&quot;   In its cadence, its content and its implicit campaignstrategy, Sen. Kerrey's formal announcement here echoedcandidate John F. Kennedy and his promise to &quot;get thiscountry moving again.&quot; The theme, too, was candidateKennedy's theme: A call for a new generation of politicalleadership to break with the past.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;I want to lead America's fearless, restless voyage ofgenerational progress,&quot; the 48-year-old candidate told anoutdoor rally bathed in the balmy sunlight of early autumn.&quot;. . . I believe Americans know deep in their bones thatsomething is terribly wrong and that business as usual -- theprescription for the '80s -- cannot work for our future. . .. My generation is uniquely positioned to understand whatmust be done.&quot;   Mr. Kerrey lost his lower right leg in Vietnam and wasawarded the Medal of Honor. A Navy SEAL then, he was woundedwhile leading a predawn commando raid. His political campaignwill live or die on charisma. Its central task is to ignitethe Vietnam and post-Vietnam generations -- generationslittle moved by more conventional politicians and skepticalthat national politics makes much difference in their dailylives.   The first-term senator is an unconventional man, and hiscampaign promises to be unconventional, too. A divorcedfather of two, he's probably best known outside Nebraska forhis relationship with actress Debra Winger. He generallyvotes liberal, yet distrusts ideology. He was one of eightsenators to oppose the savings and loan bailout. He alsoopposed the Persian Gulf War. Yet, after that war ended invictory, he praised President Bush and deprecated himself:&quot;Not only did I fail to persuade a majority of the Congress,I didn't persuade a majority of Nebraskans]&quot;   In contrast to Iowa Democratic hopeful Tom Harkin, whoattacks President Bush on personal terms, Sen. Kerreycontinued to be polite and respectful. His prepared text evencontained a line, omitted in his delivery, praising RonaldReagan and the &quot;Evil Empire&quot; phrase he applied to the oldSoviet Union. Yet Sen. Kerrey portrayed Mr. Bush as aninhabitant of a vanishing world: &quot;A proud man of the Cold Wargeneration.&quot; And his speech ripped &quot;the unchecked selfishnessand greed&quot; of the Reagan-Bush era.   &quot;They invoked morality but winked at greed,&quot; he said togrowing applause. &quot;They criticized the public sector but thenrobbed it blind. They spoke of balanced budgets but neversubmitted one. They railed against taxes but then raisedtaxes on the middle class. They called for civil rights but .. . practiced racial politics.&quot;   Sen. Kerrey's first stop after announcing was Denver -- achoice foreshadowing a campaign likely to look more towardthe West than Democrats usually do. The Kerrey campaign staffis full of ex-staffers for Colorado's Gary Hart, whose 1984presidential bid also was built around the theme ofgenerational change.   &quot;. . . President Bush is not the enemy,&quot; he told the crowdin Lincoln. &quot;A more difficult enemy for us to defeat is ourown pessimism, particularly for us in the Democratic Party.&quot;   He added: &quot;I want the Democratic Party to become a can-doparty again. . . . It is time again for us to do greatthings.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
