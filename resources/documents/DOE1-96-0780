Some of the shortcomingswhich still persist in realizing the efficiency such systems can offerare due to objective and subjective factors within and outside the managementsystems: the creation of the component base, automation equipment, andcomputer technology, on the one hand, and the organization, process,engineering, and coordination of mining work on the other. This reviewaddresses several of these shortcomings with recommendations for theirsolution in a primary and systematic way and suggests methods for theimplementation of microprocessors and a network of flexible data transmissionand processing facilities for both surface and underground mining.</TEXT></DOC>
