Patents applyonly to strict copies of a defined process (which is why it's easier to seeif you infringe, but harder to determine if a patent is valid), and otherinventors may sell or patent improvements.andP;  Copyrights, however, apply alsoto derivative works  - whether copies in other forms (different language,say) or enhancements or other modifications.andP;  In either case, you need alicense (or resale agreement) if your work includes the original.andP;  Apatent-holder may frequently execute a cross-license with the inventor of animproved product, leaving them both free to sell the improved product.andO;(Relative value and market factors determine the share of royalties eachreceives.) Copyright: The law ain&quot;t broke; it just ain&quot;t working yetandM;On the copyright front, things will resolve themselves (slowly) as thecopyrig cases wend their way through the courts.andP;  Ashton-Tate's suit, whichmay decide the copyrightability of a computer language as opposed to the&quot;look and feel&quot; of a product to the user, will be a landmark if it's notdecided on a technicality.) Whoever suffers in the short run, everyone willbenefit in the long run as the courts make clear what is protectable and whatis not, and as judges become better-educated.andM;Some lawyers such as Pamela Samuelson, a widely published lawyer in thefield, are uncomfortable with the idea of copyrighting software because ofthe uncertainty of its applicability, the long period of protection (50 yearsor more) and the long-tail way it works.andP;  Moreover, she notes, it has nodoctrines for dealing with technology issues such as compatibility or sheerfunctionality.andM;Software, even user interfaces, is functional material.andP;  But while thepatent/copyright line is fuzzy, we believe it's real: The two means ofprotectio apply to different aspects of a program.andP;  First of all, we believe,copyright protects what you see on the screen, the structure and sequence ofthe program (how it's organized), and the actual code.andP;  These may befunctional in the abstract, but the function of how you achieve an effect  -say, how you highlight a particular section of the screen, as opposed to thedescription or effect of the display itself thereby created  - is the kind offunction protected by a patent.andP;  These are equivalent to the facts in atextbook, which are not protected by copyright, but may be protected bypatent (especially if it's a technical textbook).andM;Of course, there may be large parts of a program not protectable by any means- vanilla expressions of vanilla ideas using technology and structures ingeneral use.andM;Vanilla visionandM;At this point, the general direction of the courts is unclear.andP;  The recentdecisions in the Ninth Circuit4 appear to be knowledgeable, not prone tosweeping phrases such as 'look and feel.andP;  They're deciding cases along tradition lines: Look at the facts, see what you have to decide, and then decidethat, without making speeches,&quot; says computer lawyer Esther Schachterapprovingly.andP;  Thus, many court decisions are being based on other issues  -indicating a judiciary that is reluctant to set general precedents.andP;  Forexample, most of the recent Apple decision was based on contract law, whenthe judge found that the displays in Windows 2.03 were covered in the 1985contract between Apple and Microsoft, and did not rule on whether they werecovered by copyright.andP;  open to question is the specific issue of overlappingwindows  - which we consider an idea - and some specifics of icon behavior -which may well be copyrightable expressions.andM;Nonetheless, there seems to be some movement towards supporting copyrightprotection of software look and feel, but not in a way that unduly restrictsnew development (as opposed to knock-offs).andP;  Reverse-engineering (as in theIntel case and most likely in the language portion of the Ashton-Tate suit)seems to be okay.andM;Take a legislator to lunch...andM;( ...  preferably before you have a case pending in his jurisdiction!)andM;There are still a couple of things the industry can do to speed improvementthe situation.andP;  One is simply to educate the courts and legislature.andP;  You cando this by talking with the ones you know, writing to the ones who representyou, speaking to the press, and getting active in your trade associations(ADAPSO and SPA).andP;  The problem with the trade associations, however, is thatthey can't come to agreement among their own members, and thus are notterribly effective as lobbying forces on this issue  - although they've beeneffective in raising consciousness on outright duplication of software.andP;  Butit's important that government officials at least understand the issues.andO;Make yourself clear One obvious immediate response is for vendors themselvesto provide guidelines themselves, as noted above, rather than rely onuncertain interpretation of possibly inapplicable copyright laws.andP;  Softwarevendors should  make it clear whether they consider their productsproprietary, just as they doandM;with patents.andP;  In short, they should provide   an explicit unilateralandM;contract (not a legal notion!) to guide customer and third-party behavior andlegal interpretation of their rights.andP;  (ADAPSO is currently discussing aposition along these lines; see page 21.andP;  Adobe, page 4, is exemplary in thisrespect.andP;  By contrast, one big issue in the Ashton-Tate case is that thecompany encouraged third parties to use its language for many years beforedeciding recently that it wanted to retain that privilege for itself.) It'sno fair waiting for your product to become a standard before you turn aroundand sue many of the very people who helped it become one.andP;  Users and thirdparties have a responsibility too: They should avoid using the products of,and rewarding, vendors who haven't made a clear statement of what theyconsider proprietary.andM;FOR EXAMPLE: THE APPLE SUITandM;As we've said before (see Release 1.0, 88-4), we think Apple should havetended to business rather than file a suit which it appears to have lost onthe basis of a carelessly drawn contract.andP;  According to the most recentruling by Judge Schwarzer, the contract basically allows Microsoft (andthereby Hewlett-Packard) to use anything that was in Windows 1.0 in any wayand any product it pleases.andP;  Apple's argument was basically: We can't havemeant that; we wouldn't have been so stupid.andP;  But if you read that contractcarefully, that's basically what it says.andP;  This leaves unresolved for nowonly the issue of overlapping windows and some details of how icons arelabeled and move around the screen  - and of course the slightly broaderissue of whether Apple would have had any claims at all even if it had notgiven them away.andM;A basic tenet of copyright law is the separation between ideas and expressionof those ideas.andP;  To us, windows, even overlapping windows, are an idea, whilethe precise arrangement and design of scroll bars, window icons and the like,all together, might be an expression of that idea.andP;  It might seem a littlesilly to avoid a copyright lawsuit by moving a few icons around and changingtheir (visible) design, but that's what expression is.andP;  The fundamental ideais precisely what underlies the window, and the component that is notprotectable.andM;Thus, we figure a simple solution would be for Microsoft to change a coupleof pixels on a couple of icons  - and to fight fiercely for the notion ofoverlapping windows.andP;  Aside from being a staple of the Xerox interface (longbefore it was ever called Viewpoint) that's an obvious idea  - and one of twobasic feasible ways of covering a screen.andP;  However, Microsoft isn't planningto back down, and neither is Apple.andP;  We haven't had any substantialsettlement discussions in months,&quot; says Microsoft senior corporate attorneyBill Pope.andP;  &quot;Apple is still trying to fight the case on the overall conceptand feel.andP;  They want to get rid of the overlappin windows and I know wewon't.&quot; They will meet on September 8 to plan further actions (moremeetings?).andP;  The judge has clearly indicated that it's something the partiesought to be able to settle by themselves, but don't hold your breath.andP;  Allthis smacks of a situation where the judge thinks he knows the score, but isreluctant to set a precedent until he fully understands things.andP;  We hope hetries a few more such cases and we start getting the benefit of an educatedjudiciary.andM;Xerox's Viewpoint: A &quot;safe haven&quot;andM;Meanwhile, the granddaddy of them all, Xerox, explicitly views itself asoffer a &quot;safe haven&quot; for developers who are uncertain of their rights,  saysspokesman Peter Hawes.andP;  Xerox has signed licenses for the use of itsViewpoint interface so far with Sun and with Metaphor.andP;  Those rights extendto (and royalties are payable by) ATandamp;T and IBM, among others, when they useOpenLook or the Metaphor interface.andP;  The royalties are &quot;reasonable but notnominal,&quot; says Hawes.andP;  Which is as it should be.andP;  The only argument we havewith Xerox is that it didn't act sooner, but at least it seems to be actingwith appropriate restraint.andP;  Meanwhile, Xerox, a company founded around apatent, is still talking to other people, presumably including Apple.andP;  ShouldApple pay royalties to Xerox, it would strengthen its moral case forownership of its interface  - even if that ownership went partially to Xerox.andO;Apple would lose the battle against Microsoft, but it might win the war ofprinciple.andM;A brief comment: The Lotus suitandM;The Lotus suit strikes us as a clear case against some rip-offs.andP;  A couple ofcompanies said in effect,  We're going to trade on the popularity of the1-2-3 spreadsheet, and charge less.&quot; Neither of these vendors made enoughperformance improvements (not a copyright defense anyway) to trade on muchother than price, and to rise out of the category of clearly derivativeworks.andP;  We prefer the approach of Microsoft, which genuinely advanced thestate of the art with Excel (and hasn't been sued for it).andO;</TEXT></DOC>
