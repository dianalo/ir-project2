It was found out that, by replacing calciumhydroxide by calcium formiate or calcium formiate mixed with calciumhydroxide in a component current of the scrubber water cycle, the conversionrate for Na/sub 2/SO/sub 3//NA/sub 2/SO/sub 4/ into CaSO/sub 3//CaSO/sub4/.2H/sub 2/0 can be increased and that the component current volumefrom the scrubber water cycle can be reduced in order to save energycosts.</TEXT></DOC>
