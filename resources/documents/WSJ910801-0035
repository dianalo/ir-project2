Quebec Superior Court ruled Friday that the three-year-oldfederal advertising ban is unconstitutional because itviolates the right to free speech. The Canadian governmenthas 30 days to decide whether to appeal the decision to ahigher court. The government said it's studying the ruling.</LP><TEXT>   If the government files an appeal, it isn't clear if thetobaccco concerns could begin ads before the appeal is heard.The three companies, which control about 98% of Canada'scigarette market, include Imperial Tobacco Ltd., a unit ofMontreal-based Imasco Ltd.; Toronto-based RJR-Macdonald Inc.,a unit of RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp.; and Toronto-basedRothmans, Benson andamp; Hedges Inc., which is 40%-owned by PhilipMorris Cos. and 60%-owned by a unit of Rothmans InternationalPLC of Britain.
