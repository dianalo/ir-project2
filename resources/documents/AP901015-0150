So I'lljust leave it there,'' Bush told reporters who traveled with him onAir Force One, the presidential jet.   The State Department, going a step further in criticizing theIsraeli Cabinet's decision, said through spokeswoman Margaret D.Tutwiler: ``The United States voted for this resolution because wethink it is right. And therefore we are disappointed that theIsraeli government has decided not to cooperate with the mission.''   The U.S. official added: ``In fact, we think that failure tocooperate denies Israel an opportunity to present its case to theSecretary-General. We are hopeful that the Secretary-General'speople will be able to carry out this mission.''   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, in a message to ForeignMinister David Levy before the vote, ``made clear our sense ofconcern over Israel's handling of the situation,'' Ms. Tutwilersaid later.   The 19 Palestinians were killed by Israeli police on thehallowed Temple Mount, sacred to Moslems and Jews, last Monday. Theshootings were the climax to a riot that began when Palestiniansthrew rocks onto Jewish worshipers praying below at the WesternWall, a sacred site to Jews. Police first used tear gas and rubberbullets, then live ammunition.   The United States drafted a resolution for the Security Councilto condemn the Israeli police while also regretting interferencewith worship. The Palestine Liberation Organization, through Yemen,proposed censuring Israel and establishing U.N. oversight ofIsrael's treatment of Palestinians.   Finally, the Council last Friday night adopted a modifiedversion of the U.S. draft, authorizing Secretary-General JavierPerez de Cuellar to send investigators to Jerusalem but withoutcalling for permanent U.N. involvement.   Israel's Cabinet on Sunday issued a communique calling theresolution ``completely unacceptable.'' It said Israel would notreceive the delegation.   State Department spokeswoman Tutwiler, confirming reports in theIsraeli press, said Baker had interceded with Levy before the vote.   In a message through the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv, he told Levythat admitting the U.N. mission would not have set a precedentsince Israel had accepted a representative of Perez de Cuellar inJune, the U.S. official said.   ``We would like to see this issue concluded and hope that Israelwill find a way to work with the Secretary-General'srepresentative,'' Ms. Tutwiler said in a statement.   Israeli reports said Baker wrote Levy he was worried thatrejection would focus world attention on Israel instead of Iraq,whose annexation of Kuwait the United States is trying to reverse.   According to the newspaper Yediot Ahronot, Baker told Levy: ``Ata time when I am sure that you would have preferred that therewould not have been any Security Council decision at all, weexerted every effort, including threats of a veto, against the muchharsher proposal that had been approved.   ``We supported this decision that we felt that Israel shouldhave been prepared and capable of dealing with the violence andrioting without killing 20 people or injuring 150. In the fact thatthey were not prepared, Israel played into the hands of (IraqiPresident) Saddam Hussein...   ``I am worried that if you reject this mission that is about totravel to Israel, you will put Israel, and not Iraq, at the centerof world attention.''   Baker also told Levy the United States would ask the SecurityCouncil to reconvene ``to reach a new decision'' on Iraq'saggression against Kuwait. ``We will not allow Saddam Hussein toget off the hook,'' the letter said.   Spokeswoman Tutwiler did not confirm the authenticity of theletter or release a text here. She said she had to consult Baker.   The administration has taken the position it was not connectingIraq's invasion of Kuwait with the dispute between Israel andPalestinians.   Saddam Hussein has called for considering the two issuessimultaneously. Bush in a speech to the U.N. General Assembly twoweeks ago said an Iraqi withdrawal could lead to opportunities toresolve the Israeli-Palestinian issue.</TEXT></DOC>
