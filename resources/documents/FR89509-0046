The Department has now completedthat administrative review in accordance with section 751 of the TariffAct of 1930 (``the Tariff Act'').<ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of Review</ITAG>The United States, under the auspices of the Customs Cooperation Council,has developed a system of tariff classification based on the internationalharmonized system of Customs nomenclature. On January 1, 1989, the UnitedStates fully converted to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS), as providedfor in section 1201 et seq. of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Actof 1988. All merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumptionon or after that date is now classified solely according to the appropriateHTS item number(s).Imports covered by this review are shipments of Mexican ceramic tile, includingnon-mosaic, glazed, and unglazed ceramic floor and wall tile. During thereview period, such merchandise was classifiable under item numbers 532.2400and 532.2700 of the Tariff Schedules of the United States Annotated. Thismerchandise is currently classifiable under HTS item numbers 6907.10.0000,6907.90.0000, 6908.10.5000 and 6908.90.000. The HTS item numbers are providedfor convenience and Customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive.The review covers the period January 1, 1986 through December 31, 1986and thirteen programs: (1) FOMEX; (2) Article 15 of the General Law ofCredit Institutions and Auxiliary Organizations; (3) CEPROFI; (4) FONEI;(5) FOGAIN; (6) state tax incentives; (7) National Industrial DevelopmentFund (FOMIN); (8) NDP preferential discounts; (9) Trust Fund for the Studyand Development of Industrial Parks (FIDEIN); (10) Bancomext loans; (11)delay of payments on loans; (12) delay of payments to PEMEX of fuel charges;and (13) import duty reductions and exemptions.<ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Comments Received</ITAG>We gave interested parties an opportunity to comment on the preliminaryresults. We received written comments from three respondents: CeramicaRegiomontana, Ceramica y Pisos Industriales de Culiacan and IndustriasIntercontinental (``the respondents'').<T3>Comment 1:</T3> The respondents contend that the Department does nothave the legal authority to impose countervailing duties on ceramic tilefrom Mexico and must revoke the countervailing duty order.Effective April 23, 1985, the date of the Understanding between the UnitedStates and Mexico Regarding Subsidies and Countervailing Duties (``theUnderstanding''), the United States Trade Representative designated Mexico``a country under the Agreement'' as defined in section 701 of the TariffAct. Since Mexico is now a ``country under the Agreement,'' section 303of the Tariff Act is no longer applicable to any merchandise from Mexico.The United States Trade Representative did not exclude existing countervailingduty orders from the application of ``country under the Agreement'' status.Therefore, section 701 entitles Mexico to a determination by the InternationalTrade Commission (``ITC'') that the subject merchandise materially injuresor threatens material injury to a United States industry producing a likeproduct. Pursuant to section 701, the Department cannot impose countervailingduties on any merchandise from Mexico without an affirmative ITC injurydetermination. Since the ITC has indicated that it does not have the authorityto conduct an injury investigation on merchandise already subject to anoutstanding order, the Department should revoke this order.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We continue to believe that we cannot revokethis countervailing duty order on the basis of the Understanding. Whileit is true that the United States Trade Representative determined on April23, 1985, that Mexico became a ``country under the Agreement'' (50 FR 18335;April 30, 1985), the application of that status was limited by Article5 of the Understanding to countervailing duty proceedings which had notprogressed to the issuance of a final determination (and simultaneous order).We have confirmed with the principal U.S. negotiators that the intent ofArticle 5 was to exclude from the application of the Understanding, andhence application of ``country under the Agreement'' status, countervailingduty orders existing before April 23, 1985. Section 303 continues to applyto such orders.As we explained in several other final results notices, we believe thatwe lack the authority to revoke any countervailing duty order on Mexicanproducts on the basis of the Understanding. <T3>See, e.g., Certain Iron-Metal Construction Castings from Mexico; FinalResults of Countervailing Duty Administrative Review </T3>(51 FR 9698;March 20, 1986), Portland Hydraulic Cement and Cement Clinker from Mexico;Final Results of Counterviling Duty Administration Review, (51 FR 44501;December 10, 1986), and <T3>Portland Hydraulic Cement and Cement Clinker from Mexico; Final Resultsof Countervailing Duty Administrative Review </T3>( 53 FR 18325; May 23,1988).<T3>Comment 2:</T3> The respondents maintain that the Department is inerror by contending that the injury provision of the Understanding affectsonly countervailing duty orders issued after April 23, 1985. In a recentCourt of International Trade (``CIT'') decision, <T3>Cementos Anahuac del Golfo, S.A.</T3> v. <T3>United States,</T3> 12 CIT ___, 687 F.Supp. 1558 (1988), the CIT determinedthat after the effective date of the Understanding, countervailing dutiescould only be imposed on Mexican merchandise following an affirmative ITCinjury determination, regardless of whether the countervailing duty orderwas issued before or after the effective date of the Understanding. TheCIT remanded the review, instructing the Department to follow section 701rather than section 303 of the Tariff Act. The Department should do thesame in this case.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> The CIT's decision in <T3>Cementos Anahuac del Golfo, S.A.</T3> v. <T3>United States</T3> (``<T3>Anahuac I</T3>'') applies only to <T3>Portland Hydraulic Cement and Cement Clinker from Mexico; Final Resultsof Administrative Review of Countervailing Duty Order</T3> (50 FR 51732;December 19, 1985), which covered the period July 1, 1983 through December31, 1983. Moreover, we are appealing the <T3>Anahuac I </T3>decision.The respondents ignore an even more recent decision in the cement proceeding,<T3>Cementos Anahuac del Golfo, S.A.</T3> v. <T3>United States,</T3> Slip Op. 88-75, (June 9, 1988), (``<T3>Anahuac II</T3>''), which supports our position that the Understandingdoes not require an affirmative injury determination for Mexican countervailingduty orders issued before April 23, 1985.<T3>Comment 3:</T3> The respondents contend that the Department's failureto revoke this order is inconsistent with past practice. In three previouscountervailing duty administrative reviews, where an outstanding countervailingduty order was issued pursuant to section 303(a)(1), <T3>Certain Fasteners from India; Final Results of Administrative Reviewand Partial Revocation of Countervailing Duty Order</T3> (47 FR 44129;October 6, 1982), <T3>Certain Scissors and Shears from Brazil; Preliminary Results of AdministrativeReview of Countervailing Duty Order</T3> (50 FR 11927; March 26, 1985),and <T3>Carbon Steel Wire Rod from Trinidad and Tobago; Intention to Reviewand Preliminary Results of Changed Circumstances; Administrative Reviewand Tentative Determination to Revoke Countervailing Duty Order</T3> (50FR 19561; May 9, 1985) the Department determined that it did not have theauthority to impose countervailing duties when events subsequent to theissuance of the order required an affirmative ITC injury determinationprior to imposition of countervailing duties.Merchandise subject to an outstanding countervailing duty order, issuedpursuant to section 303(a)(1) without benefit of an ITC injury determination,is entitled to an injury determination when there is a change in the statusof the merchandise or the country. Since the ITC has indicated that itdoes not have the authority to conduct an injury investigation concerningmerchandise already subject to countervailing duty orders, the Departmenthas in the past concluded that it could not impose countervailing dutiesand revoked, or preliminary determined to revoke, the order effective thedate the affirmative injury determination became a requirement.<T3>Department's Response:</T3> In the cases cited by the respondents,the United States had international obligations with the exporting countriesbased on their membership in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,and the merchandise was duty-free during the potential assessment period.Consequently, the Department determined that the merchandise covered bythe countervailing duty order was subject to section 303(a)(2) of the TariffAct. None of the precedents cited by the respondents is analogous to thisproceeding because ceramic tile from Mexico is not duty-free and, therefore,is not subject to section 303(a)(2).Further, as explained in our response to Comment 1, the application of``country under the Agreement'' status was limited by Article 5 of theUnderstanding to countervailing duty proceedings under section 303 thathad not progressed to the issuance of a countervailing duty order. Additionally,the CIT's decision in <T3>Anahuac II</T3> supports our position.<ITAG tagnum="84">Final Results of Review</ITAG>After considering all comments received, we determine the total bountyor grant to be zero or <T3>de minimis</T3> for 36 firms and 4.28 percent <T3>ad valorem</T3> for all other firms during the period January 1, 1986through December 31, 1986.The following 36 firms received zero or <T3>de minimis</T3> benefits during the period of review:(1) Augustin Cedillo Ruiz(2) Alfonso Cortez Coronel(3) Azulejos Orion(4) Benjamin Chavez Torres(5) Ceramica Santa Julia(6) Dionicio Sanchez Cruz(7) Eduardo S. Garcia de la Pena(8) Fernando Espinosa Sanchez(9) Francisco Almanza Estrada(10) Francisco Gallegos Olivares(11) Idelfonso Chavez Parga(12) Ines Bustos Vargas(13) Isabel Cortez Coronel(14) Jesus Ambrosia Garcia R.(15) Jesus Garza Arocha(16) Jesus Gallegos Olivares(17) Jesus Jimenez Lucio(18) Jose Angel Hernandez Martinez(19) Jose Davilla Torres(20) Jose Dolores Herandez Zaucedo(21) Jose R.

Therefore, for purposesof the cash deposit of estimated countervailing duties, we determine thatthe rates are the same as the review period assessment rates.The Department will instruct the Customs Service to waive cash depositsof estimated countervailing duties, as provided by section 751(a)(1) ofthe Tariff Act, on shipments of this merchandise from the 36 firms listedabove and to collect a cash deposit of estimated countervailing dutiesof 4.28 percent of the f.o.b. invoice price on shipments from all otherfirms entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or afterthe date of publication of this notice. This deposit requirement and waivershall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the nextadministrative review.This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1)of the Tariff Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1)) and section 355.22 of the CommerceRegulations published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on December 27, 1988 (53 FR 52306) (to be codifiedat 19 CFR 355.22).<ITAG tagnum="6">Timothy N.
