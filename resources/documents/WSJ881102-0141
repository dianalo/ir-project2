If the ruling stands, banks, particularly state-chartered ones, could lose some powers that they now have to invest in real estate and sell insurance and securities. The Fed generally has been more conservative than many states and the federal Comptroller of the Currency in granting bank holding companies broader powers.    The ruling, which involves a unit of Citicorp's Citibank, also has important political repercussions because it diminishes the role of the states, as well as the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency, in regulating banks.    Kenneth Guenther, executive director of the Independent Bankers Association of America, a trade group representing small banks, said, &quot;This decision, if it stands, will result in an enormous shift of regulatory powers toward the Fed.&quot;    The Independent Bankers Association, as well as the American Bankers Association, The Association of Bank Holding Companies, and the Consumer Bankers Association have joined to file a friend of the court brief asking the appellate court to reconsider the case. If that fails, they will ask the U.S. Supreme Court to take up the issue.    Under the existing regulatory scheme, the Fed regulates the activities of bank holding companies. Individual banks within holding companies are monitored by either the Comptroller of the Currency or state bank supervisers.    In the case at hand, the American Insurance Association challenged Comptroller of the Currency Robert L. Clarke's approval of the purchase of American Municipal Bond Assurance Corp. by Citibank. The insurers claimed federal law prevents banks from selling insurance.    On Aug. 23, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia upheld the Comptroller of the Currency's approval of the purchase of the insurance company. The Comptroller had found that municipal bond insurance is functionally the same as banks' standby letters-of-credit. However, the court said that Citicorp needed the Fed's permission, as well as the Comptroller's, to make the acquisition.    Upset by the Fed portion of the ruling, Mr. Clarke and L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., persuaded Solicitor General Charles Fried to take up the appeal in order to put the full weight of the executive branch on their side. And, although it initially trumpeted the ruling as a victory, Citicorp is also seeking to have part of the ruling reversed.    On Oct. 24, the three-judge appellate panel agreed to reconsider its earlier ruling. But regardless of the appellate court's final action, the case appears headed for the U.S. Supreme Court.    Some banking experts argue that the Fed should be able to set the boundaries on businesses that state and national banks can undertake. If one of these banks were to fail and endanger the nation's payment system, the Fed likely would be called upon to fashion a rescue plan. They argue that the Fed should have some say in what these banks can do.    A Fed spokesman said: &quot;We think that the court was correct. I assume we'll be filing a brief in support of it.&quot;    So far, eleven states allow banks to operate full-service insurance brokerages. More than 20 states permit banks to engage in real estate development and investment. In 16 states, banks can underwrite securities.    Moreover, several states, including New York, are under pressure to give banks even broader powers since the 100th Congress recently adjourned without acting on bank powers legislation.    State-rights advocates say the ruling tramples on the states' role in supervising state-chartered banks.    David Roederer, an attorney with Jones, Day, Reavis andamp; Pogue who represents the Conference of State Bank Supervisers, said: &quot;We view this ruling with substantial alarm. If it stands, the Fed will be able to dictate what powers are appropriate for a bank. The states have the right to decide what banking activities are necessary to enhance the economies of their states. This is what states are all about.&quot;    The ruling affects even small state-chartered banks, since many have shell holding companies for purposes related to taxes and shareholder voting.    H. Rodgin Cohen, an attorney with Sullivan andamp; Cromwell, said: &quot;The irony is that the initiative in virtually every other arena of banking deregulation -- from interstate banking to interest rates -- has been left to the states. Banking powers represent the last step.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
