The former employee, Steven W. Agee, an aerospace engineer, worked for a special safety team set up by Thiokol at its Brigham City, Utah, plant during the 1987 rebuilding of the rocket motor.    &quot;We had nothing but problems on the project. I did everything a human being could to warn Morton Thiokol and they wouldn't listen,&quot; Mr. Agee said.    Mr. Agee, who now runs his own exporting company in Seattle, said that it was his understanding that a federal grand jury in Salt Lake City has begun taking testimony in connection with the investigation. Mr. Agee said that at the request of the FBI he wore a tape recorder for three months and recruited others as undercover informants while working at the Brigham City plant in 1987.    The latest controversy over Morton Thiokol's redesigned rockets comes only weeks before the expected launch of the space vehicle. The shuttle is now expected to go into orbit by early October. Earlier this week, the National Research Council, a scientific watchdog group, approved Morton Thiokol's redesigned booster rocket and said it should result in &quot;considerably enhanced safety and reliability.&quot;    Anthony W. Laine, a Phoenix, Ariz., physicist who worked on the project in 1987 also said yesterday in an interview that the FBI taped Morton Thiokol employees as part of an investigation into suppression of safety information. Edwin B. McLean, a Phoenix attorney who represents both Messrs. Agee and Laine said they have provided information to the FBI alleging Morton Thiokol executives hushed up safety concerns.    Messrs. Agee and Laine filed separate lawsuits in federal court here Monday charging they were wrongfully dismissed by Morton Thiokol. Mr. Laine said senior Morton Thiokol officials ordered him to stop investigating a potential hazard involving the rocket motor's electromagnetic &quot;plume.&quot; Mr. Agee said he wrote 221 hazard reports that Thiokol officials kept from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.    Morton Thiokol released a statement yesterday calling the charges in the lawsuits &quot;without merit.&quot; The company said the two former employees were &quot;job shoppers&quot; hired by ARC Technical Services, a subcontractor set up to hire for the Chicago-based company's Brigham City project. A Morton Thiokol official declined to confirm or deny that federal investigators have been looking at the Utah project.    Spokesmen for the FBI in Washington and Salt Lake City didn't return telephone calls about the allegations. The FBI customarily declines to comment on pending investigations.    Earlier this month, a federal judge in Salt Lake City dismissed two claims against Thiokol totaling $3 billion by another engineer who said he had been defamed by the company after he told federal investigators about problems with the booster rocket.    Thiokol made the rocket whose failure caused the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger Jan. 28, 1986. NASA subsequently paid Thiokol more than $500 million to redesign the space vehicle and improve safety procedures.    A NASA spokesman couldn't be reached for comment late yesterday on the lawsuits filed by the former Thiokol employees.    Mr. Agee, who has worked in the aerospace industry for more than 20 years, was hired by Morton Thiokol in November 1986 to work on the project's systems safety analysis unit. The unit was supposed to analyze each component of the rocket motor to determine potential points of failure and report directly to NASA. &quot;We found nothing but problems,&quot; Mr. Agee said. &quot;We tried to get our information to NASA and (Morton Thiokol) suppressed it.&quot;    Mr. Laine, who also has a lengthy aerospace resume, said in his lawsuit that he was told by Thiokol officials to stop his work on the potential hazard of the electromagnetic plume and concentrate only on &quot;cut and paste&quot; rehashes of old reports. The physicist, who is a specialist in electromagnetic field effects, said he was fired about a month later after he kept on with his research. </TEXT></DOC>
