Brazil's O Globo newspaper said police in the Paraguayan city of Ciudaddel Este arrested two men after the fugitives' planelanded at Hernandario airport, about 20 miles from the border. The menwere not identified.   Neither Paraguayan officials nor Brazil's Air Force Ministry couldimmediately confirm the report.   The drama began Aug. 3 when 9-year-old Said Agel Filho was abductedin front of his home in the central Brazilian city ofGoiania, 850 miles northwest of Rio.   Six days later, police traced a phone call from the kidnappers to theboy's family and surrounded a house on the city'soutskirts. The kidnappers negotiated a ransom of about $42,000 and an armoredcar to escape.   Three adults, including two television news reporters, then offeredto exchange places with the boy, and the kidnappers accepted.   The kidnappers, identified as two married couples, headed for the GoianiaAirport, but authorities there refused to give them aplane and pilot. The kidnappers then set off on a 500-mile trip throughthe states of Goias, Minas Gerais and Sao Paulo.   To eat, one kidnapper stepped out of the car holding a pistol to acaptive's head.   The hostages were released unharmed Sunday after authorities in PresidentePrudente, 630 miles southwest of Rio, provided thekidnappers with a plane and a pilot.   ``I lived for four days with a pistol at my head but not for one minutedid I believe I would die,'' said released hostage MonicaCalassa. ``A person who trades their life for that of another's can't dielike that.''   A police spokesman, Nivaldo de Pirondi, told The Associated Press thepilot who flew the getaway plane was Aniceto de OliveiraGomes, a rancher and a local mayor. De Pirondi said a second unidentifiedman accompanied Gomes on the plane.   Brazilian press reports said the group planned to fly to Paraguay wheretheir leader, identified as Rui Ribeiro de Campos, owns afarm.   Several previous attempts to negotiate the hostage's release in exchangefor getaway transportation for the kidnappers ended infailure.   A plane promised by police on Friday developed mechanical troublesand was forced to land in a nearby field.   On Saturday, police agreed to supply a helicopter and pilot to flythe kidnappers to Paraguay. But the plan collapsed at the lastminute when the pilot refused to fly the craft after the kidnappers demandedthey carry submachine guns, hand grenades, pistols andshotguns aboard.   Police dispatched a plane Saturday night but the pilot was forced toturn back as darkness made it impossible to land on thenarrow highway where the kidnappers' car was parked.</TEXT></DOC>
