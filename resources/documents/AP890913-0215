He had just arrived from CostaRica.   Robelo is the latest of several former and current members of theNicaraguan Resistance directorate who have returned to Nicaraguafrom exile. All have said they will take part in general electionsset for Feb. 25.   A chemical engineer and businessman, Robelo co-founded the SocialDemocratic Movement in 1978 with businesspeople, industrialists andprofessionals opposed to then-President Anastasio Somoza.   The movement is one of 14 parties now making up the NationalOpposition Union, the main anti-Sandinista bloc in the campaign.   Robelo was one of the five original members of the provisionalgovernment junta after Somoza fled the country in July 1979 and theSandinistas came to power. He resigned from the junta in April 1980over disagreements with Sandinista policies and left the country inMarch 1982.   Robelo was elected to the directorate of the NicaraguanResistance, an umbrella group of exiled anti-Sandinista group, inMay 1987. He resigned in January 1988, when President Oscar Arias ofCosta Rica ordered that Nicaraguans living in Costa Rica mustrenounce membership in armed anti-Sandinista groups.   On Wednesday, Robelo drove across the Nicaraguan-Costa Ricanborder and arrived at party headquarters alone in the earlyafternoon in a red sedan, apologizing for being late and saying hehad gotten lost.   ``I have not come looking for positions; I didn't come to competewith anybody,'' Robelo told journalists. ``I'm happy to say I'mpresent.''   He said he would not seek an elected post but had come to helphis party and the opposition alliance ``in whatever way I can beuseful.''</TEXT></DOC>
