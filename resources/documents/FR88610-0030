Schaefer, telephone(202) 673-5263.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>Section 302(f)(6) of the Magnuson Actrequires each Council to determine its organization, and prescribe itspractices and procedures for carrying out its functions under the Act inaccordance with such uniform standards as are prescribed by the Secretaryof Commerce. This action repromulgates the Secretary's uniform standardsgoverning the operations of the Councils. It includes: (1) Implementationof parts of Title I of Pub. L. 99-659; (2) supplementary instruction onrequirements affecting the Councils under other applicable law; (3) guidelinesfor the fishery management process; and (4) guidelines for (a) CouncilStatements of Organization, Practices, and Procedures, (b) Council organization,(c) employment practices, (d) financial management systems, and (e) recordkeeping.Included are some of the changes to the fishery management process approvedby the Under Secretary that had been recommended by the two fishery managementstudies commissioned by NOAA in 1985 and 1986: the NOAA/Council Task GroupReport, and the NOAA Fishery Management Study. These two studies, eachof which generated wide public comment, were undertaken to assess the MagnusonAct fishery management system after ten years of operation, with a viewto making administrative and legislative improvements.Other 1986 efforts to examine the Magnuson Act system, including the MackerelInvestigative Committee, the joint New England and Mid-Atlantic Councilproposal, and the Center for Ocean Management Systems conference on RethinkingFishery Management, have figured in the development of these regulationsand guidelines. Some of the ideas are derived from procedures successfullyimplemented by the Councils over the years. Selected material from theMagnuson Act Operations Handbook and from the Operational Guidelines forthe Fishery Management Process has been updated and included.Three new parts and one subpart have been added: (1) Part 500_Definitions,is designed ultimately to consolidate the definitions, word usages, andabbreviations that apply to Chapter 6 of the CFR in one place. For purposesof this revision, only those definitions broadly connected with Parts 601-605are included; definitions and word usages uniquely associated with particulartopics remain in their appropriate section. (2) Part 601, Subpart D_Membership,addresses requirements affecting Council members individually, such asappointment, term, removal, conduct, compensation, financial disclosure,and so forth. (3) Part 604_Other Applicable Law_describes the requirementsof other law that the Secretary has determined to be applicable to thefishery management process. (4) Part 605_Guidelines for Council Operationsand Administration_provides guidance for the development of (a) fisherymanagement plans, and (b) each Council's Statement of Organization, Practices,and Procedures (SOPP).The basic structure and authorities under the Magnuson Act were not changedby Title I of Pub. L. 99-659; however, certain requirements were modifiedor added. Provisions reflecting approved Task Group and Study recommendationsare identified with an asterick (*) in the following descriptive text.Statutory procedures addressed in these regulations include:<ITAG tagnum="84">Council Structure and Operation</ITAG>(1) Nomination and Appointment of Council Members*Section 601.33(b) defines ``knowledgeable and experienced'' to clarifythe basis on which governors nominate and the Secretary appoints. Thissection also includes the Pub. L. 99-659 requirement that governors consultcommercial and recreational fishing representatives in the nomination process,and that the Secretary ensure a fair apportionment of membership. An oathof office, recommended by the Fishery Management Study, is included. Thefinancial disclosure requirements of Pub. L. 99-659 are set forth in andSection;601.37. In addition, NOAA is making a technical amendment, recommendedby the Study, to eliminate confusion regarding geographic proprietorshipof a Council seat. By deleting the obligatory and at-large classification,governors are required to submit nominations for every vacancy regardlessof perceived interstate representational patterns. It does not change theState representation nor the Governor's obligation to nominate three namesfor each vacancy. It does, however, provide greater flexibility for theSecretary in choosing among names provided by the Governors, because individualseats would not be designated. NOAA particularly solicits comments on theseprovisions.(2) Council Procedures for Protection of Confidential StatisticsSection 601.27 specifies that Council procedures must be consistent withprocedures of the Secretary and the laws and regulations of a State submittingthem, and expresses NOAA policy with regard to Council member and staffaccess to confidential statistics, pursuant to Pub. L. 99-659. These regulationssupplement 50 CFR Part 603, which is being revised to regionalize the accesssystem. Section 605.21 specifies that the Council SOPP should include theseprocedures.(3) Security Investigations and ClearancesSection 601.38 provides expanded and updated instruction regarding thesecurity clearance process. Paragraphs (h), (i), and (j) require the submissionof any lawful disclosure agreement, required by the National Security Councilor other lawful Directive, that may be developed in the future. (PublicLaw 100-202 prohibits the use of appropriated funds during FY 88 to requiresubmission of, to implement, or to enforce the current Government-wideNon-Disclosure Agreement Form SF-189, ``Classified Information Non-DisclosureAgreement.'')<ITAG tagnum="84">Fishery Management Process</ITAG>(4) Role of Council Advisory Groups*Section 605.23(d) highlights the functions of the advisory groups and specificallydefines advisory group involvement in the fishery management planning anddevelopment process, as per Pub. L. 99-659. This section, in combinationwith Part 605, Subpart B, suggests an operational structure that respondsto recommendations from both commissioned studies. Part 605, Subpart B,describes a process whereby issues can be identified and resolved, andavailable expertise is called upon on a continuing basis, including relevantNMFS offices, State and academic scientists, advisory groups, planningteams, and others as appropriate.(5) The Conservation Standard*In a separate action, NOAA is in the process of developing amendments tothe guidelines for two of the national standards (andSection;andSection; 602.11and 602.12), precipitated in part by recommendations of the NOAA FisheryManagement Study. The Study recommended that NOAA be responsible for determininga biologically acceptable catch for each managed fishery_the total allowableremovals from the resource which would maintain a healthy and productiveresource into the future. The Study's intent was that stocks be maintainedat some level above that which preserves the minimum spawning stock fromrecruitment overfishing. The Study sought a conservation standard suchthat stocks are not continually driven to or maintained at the thresholdof overfishing. NOAA is currently in the process of developing this conservationstandard through a series of NMFS/Council workshops.(6) The Stock Assessment and Fishery Evaluation (SAFE) Report*As part of this separate action to amend the guidelines for national standards1 and 2, NOAA is also proposing that a periodic Scientific Assessment andFishery Evaluation (SAFE) document or set of documents be prepared or aggregatedas a summary of the best biological, social, and econmic information availableto a Council when it needs such data to determine annual harvest levelsor OYs for species in each fishery management unit.Recognizing the need for early public involvement in developing new approaches,NOAA is including the SAFE proposal language in andSection; 605.13 of <T3>these </T3>guidelines_analogous to an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking_toinvite public comment early in the process. However, as indicated above,NOAA intends to present the SAFE proposal again as part of the proposedamendments to national standard guidelines 1 and 2.While the Secretary has responsibility for assuring that the SAFE reportis produced, it is not intended to be exclusively authored by NOAA. TheSAFE report may be produced by any combination of talent from Council,academic, government, or other sources. The SAFE reports are not requiredto be revised each year, except as there have been new developments orsignificant changes in a fishery. Although the contents of SAFE reportsare not mandatory, certain basic descriptive data on the stocks and industryshould be included.The SAFE report is designed to provide a tracking tool for assessing therelative achievement of FMP objectives. It would establish a time-seriesdata base indicating the relative health of stocks and the industry dependenton them. Including social and economic information in the same documentor set of documents with biological information does not diminish the integrityof either type of information. By providing a summary of the best scientificinformation available for each type of data required in the determinationof OY, subject to Council and outside peer view, the SAFE report is designedto improve the ability of Councils to derive OY or any specified harvestlevel as the Act prescribes.<ITAG tagnum="84">Other Applicable Law</ITAG>(7) Administrative Operations and Employment PracticesSection 604.3 address the statutes in this category, which include theFederal Tort Claims Act, the Fair Labor Standards Act, conflict of intereststatutes, Workmen's Compensation, and Unemployment Compensation.(8) The Fishery Management Decision ProcessSection 604.4 addresses laws in this category, which require considerationof environmental, paperwork, and/or economic and social impacts, or establishrules of procedure for public and State participation or access. They includethe Administrative Procedure Act, the National Environmental Policy Act,the Paperwork Reduction Act, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, ExecutiveOrder 12291, and Executive Order 12612.(9) Uses of Oceans and CoastlineSection 604.5 explains how the following statutes affect the fishery managementprocess: the Coastal Zone Management Act, the Endangered Species Act, theMarine Mammal Protection Act, and the Marine Protection, Research, andSanctuaries Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">Administrative Management Systems</ITAG>(10) Employment PracticesSection 605.25 establishes guideline standards to be implemented in eachCouncil's SOPP, for staffing, recruitment, details, personnel actions,salary and wage administration, benefits, and travel reimbursement.(11) Financial ManagementSection 605.26 sets out the cooperative agreement requirements and detailsrelevant portions of Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-110governing financial management systems, procurement, property and spacemanagement, and financial reporting. It establishes audit schedules andcriteria for programmatic funding.(12) RecordkeepingSection 605.27 addresses the requirements for FMP administrative records,Privacy Act records, and Freedom of Information Act requests.In summary, the proposed regulations/guidelines have been directed to providinguniform standards and guidelines which clarify the system and strengthenaccountability at both the administrative and programmatic levels.<ITAG tagnum="84">Classification</ITAG>The Under Secretary for Oceans and Atmosphere has determined that thisproposed rule is not a ``major'' rule under E.O. 12291 requiring a regulatoryimpact analysis. It prescribes agency policies and procedures and willhave no economic impact until specific management decisions contained withinspecific FMPs are made; until a given FMP is developed there is no basisfor evaluating the consequences of these management decisions. Economicimpact on small entities is addressed at a later date through regulatoryflexibility analyses for individual FMPs. For the same reasons, the GeneralCounsel of the Department of Commerce has certified to the Small BusinessAdministration that this proposed rule, if adopted, will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. As a result,a regulatory flexibility analysis was not prepared.This proposed rule is categorically excluded from the requirement to preparean environmental assessment by NOAA Directive 02-10. Section 601.37 proposesa collection-of-information requirement subject to the Paperwork ReductionAct which has been approved by the Office of Management and Budget underControl No. 0648-0192. This proposed rule does not contain policies withfederalism implications sufficient to warrant preparation of a federalismassessment under Executive Order 12612, and is issued in compliance withExecutive Order 12291. <ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: June 6, 1988.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James E.

No personmay have access to classified information unless that person has been determinedto be trustworthy, and unless access is necessary for the performance ofofficial duties. This determination, referred to as a security clearance,shall be based on an investigation in accordance with the standards andcriteria of Department Administrative Order (DAO) 207-4. The authorityhaving custody of the classified information determines whether the requesterhas a need to know the information in the performance of the requester'sofficial duties. The noncritical sensitive position has access to informationclassified as CONFIDENTIAL or SECRET which is normally sufficient for Councilpurposes; however, clearance for access to TOP SECRET information may begranted by the Secretary following regular Federal procedures. Foreignnationals may not receive security clearance; however, with the consentof the Director, DOC Office of Security, classified information may bereleased to a foreign national.(b) All Council members, staff, and members of advisory groups are individuallyrequired to protect classified information and may be subject to sanctionsif they violate E.O. 12356, 18 U.S.C. 793, 794, or 952, or the NationalSecurity Act (50 U.S.C. 401 <T3>et seq</T3>.)(c) Security clearances are required for all Council members and ExecutiveDirectors. Other staff and advisory group members may be required to obtainclearances at the Councils' discretion.

The list of laws affecting the Councils and their operations are grouped,for ease of description, into three general categories: those dealing withadministrative operations and employment practices; those dealing withthe fishery management decision process; and those dealing with other usesof the oceans and coastline.

These statutes include the Administrative Procedure Act (APA),5 U.S.C. 551-553; the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), 42 U.S.C.4321; the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA), 49 U.S.C. 3501; and the RegulatoryFlexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601. Procedures under these statutes andunder Executive Orders (E.O.) 12291 and 12612 are described as follows:(a) <T3>Administrative Procedure Act (APA). </T3>Sections of the APA (5 U.S.C.551-553) establish procedural requirements applicable to decisionmakingof Federal agencies. The purpose is to ensure public access to the rulemakingprocess, protect the rights of individuals under the Privacy Act and makeavailable to the public information requested under the Freedom of InformationAct. The effect on the Magnuson Act process is: To require a minimum 15-to 30-day public comment period for proposed rules and a 30-day delayedeffectiveness date for final rules, with justification possible for waivingor shortening both; to require the Council to maintain security of personalrecords of Council members, employees, consultants under contract, andadvisory group members; and to require NOAA to respond to requests forinformation under specified criteria for denial and time limits. Requiredprocedures under these statutes are detailed in sections 604.34 and 605.25.(b) <T3>E.O. 12291. </T3>This Executive Order (E.O.) applies to the issuanceof new rules, the review of existing rules, and the development of legislativeproposals concerning regulations. The E.O. requires that: regulatory objectivesand priorities be established with the aim of maximizing net benefits tosociety; rules be developed with a cost/benefit approach when possible;the chosen regulatory approach or alternative be the one with the leastnet cost to society; regulatory action should not be undertaken unlessthe potential benefits outweigh the potential costs to society; and administrativedecisions be based on adequate information concerning the need for andconsequences of the proposed government action. The E.O. also requiresthat a semi-annual regulatory agenda be prepared. The effect on the MagnusonAct process is to require all rules to be reviewed by OMB unless coveredby specific exemption, and to require a Regulatory Impact Analysis if therule is ``major''. A prior determination whether the rule is major or nonmajorand whether the rule complies with the above requirements is made basedon a Regulatory Impact Review.(c) <T3>National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). </T3>NEPA requires that theeffects of Federal activities on the environment be assessed. NEPA's purposeis to ensure that Federal officials weigh and give appropriate considerationin policy formulation, decisionmaking, and administrative actions to environmentalvalues and ecological, economic and social benefits and costs and thatthe public is provided adequate opportunity to review and comment on theimpact of major Federal actions. NEPA requires preparation of an EnvironmentalImpact Statement (EIS) for major Federal actions that significantly affectthe quality of the human environment. NEPA's effect on the Magnuson Actprocess is that a draft EIS, or environmental assessment for a findingof no significant impact, must be prepared. NEPA procedures are detailedin NOAA Directives Manual (NDM) 02-10.(d) <T3>Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA). </T3>The PRA requires agencies to minimizepaperwork and reporting burdens whenever collecting information from thepublic. PRA's effect on the Magnuson Act process is that if an FMP requiresany form of information collection from the public, that collection mustreceive OMB approval. To obtain OMB approval, a written justification mustbe submitted. In addition, formal Council input is needed each Spring whenthe overall NMFS information collection budget request is formulated forsubmission to OMB. Procedures under the PRA are detailed in NDM 59-11.(e) <T3>Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA). </T3>The RFA establishes the principlethat where Federal regulation is necessary, the regulation should be tailoredto the regulated entity's size and capacity to bear the regulatory burden.RFA's effect on the Magnuson Act process is to require a determinationof whether a proposed rule is likely to have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities. If the determination is affirmative,initial and final regulatory flexibility analyses must be prepared to accompanythe proposed and final rules respectively. These analyses must considerthe benefits and costs of compliance, with particular emphasis on the effectsof the rule on the competitive position, cash flow and liquidity, and abilityof the small entity to remain in the market. The RFA also requires a projectionof reporting and record-keeping requirements.(f) <T3>E.O. 12612. </T3>This E.O. requires Executive departments and agencies,in formulating and implementing policies, to be guided by federalism principlesand criteria. Federalism principles and criteria involve close consultationwith the States in any actions which have substantial direct effects onthe States or on the distribution of power and responsibility between andamong the levels of government. The effect on the Magnuson Act processis to require the Councils to identify federalism issues before submittingmanagement programs to the Secretary for approval. Any principal Stateofficial opposed to adoption of an FMP or amendment may file a dissentingreport explaining the nature of the State's objection and its relationto the policies of the executive order. (See andSection; 605.24(a)(3)(iv).)<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 604.5</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Uses of oceans and coastline.</ITAG>This category of laws also applies to the fishery management process, anddeals with the competing uses of the ocean, the protection of certain livingmarine resources and their habitats, and the management of the nation'scoastal areas. These statutes include the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA),16 U.S.C. 1451; the Endangered Species Act (ESA), 16 U.S.C. 1361; 1531;the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), 16 U.S.C. and Title III of theMarine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA), 16 U.S.C. 1431.Procedures under these statutes are described as follows:(a) <T3>Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA). </T3>The principal objective ofthe CZMA is to encourage and assist States in developing coastal zone managementprograms, to coordinate State activities, and to safeguard the regionaland national interests in the coastal zone. Section 307(c) of the CZMArequires that any Federal activity directly affecting the coastal zoneof a State be consistent with that State's approved coastal zone managementprogram to the maximum extent practicable. CZMA's effect on the MagnusonAct process is to require determination that an FMP has no direct effecton the coastal zone, or is consistent with the State's approved coastalzone management program to the maximum extent practicable. Procedures underthe CZMA are detailed in 15 CFR Part 930.(b) <T3>Endangered Species Act (ESA). </T3>The ESA provides for the conservationof endangered and threatened species of fish, wildlife, and plants. Theprogram is administered jointly by the Department of Interior (DOI), whichgenerally has jurisdiction over terrestrial and freshwater species, andthe Department of Commerce (DOC), which generally has jurisdiction overmarine species. With respect to endangered or threatened sea turtles, DOChas jurisdiction while the turtles are in the water and DOI while the turtlesare on land. Conflicts between the ESA and Federal actions are to be resolvedby a consultation process between the project agency and DOC and/or DOI,as appropriate. ESA's effect on the Magnuson Act process is to requirebiological assessment and consultation with NMFS or the Fish and WildlifeService (FWS) if an FMP or amendment may affect endangered or threatenedspecies or cause destruction or adverse modification of any designatedcritical habitat. The consultation must conclude that there is no likelihoodof jeopardy to any listed species, or, if jeopardy exists, reasonable andprudent alternatives approved by NMFS or FWS must be adopted before theFMP can be approved.(c) <T3>Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA). </T3>The MMPA establishes a moratoriumon the taking of marine mammals and a ban on the importation of marinemammal products with certain exceptions. Responsibility is divided betweenDOC (whales, porpoises, seals, and sea lions) and DOI (other marine mammals)to issue permits and to waive the moratorium for specified purposes, includingincidental takings during commercial fishing operations. The Magnuson Actamended the MMPA to extend its jurisdiction to the EEZ. MMPA's effect onthe Magnuson Act process is that if the FMP has an effect on the marinemammal population, certain information must be included in the EIS, andthe FMP should indicate whether permits are needed for any incidental takings.(d) <T3>Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA). </T3>TitleIII of the MPRSA authorizes the Secretary to designate as marine sanctuariesareas of the marine environment that have been identified as having specialnational significance due to their resource or human-use values. The MarineSanctuaries Amendments of 1984 amend this Title to include, as consultativeagencies in determining whether the proposal meets the sanctuary designationstandards, the Councils affected by the proposed designation. The Amendmentsalso authorize the Council affected to prepare draft regulations for theSecretary's approval, consistent with the Magnuson Act national standardsand the goals and objectives of the proposed designation, for fishing withinthe EEZ as it may deem necessary to implement a proposed designation.<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 605_GUIDELINES FOR COUNCIL OPERATIONS/ADMINISTRATION</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart A_General</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">605.1 Purpose and scope.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart B_Operations</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">605.11 General.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">605.12 Use of available expertise.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">605.13 Use of best available scientific information.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">605.14 Planning.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">605.15 Fishery management objectives.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">605.16 Establishment of management measures.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart C_Administration</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">605.21 Council Statement of Organization, Practices, and Procedures(SOPP).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">605.22 SOPP checklist.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">605.23 Council organization.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">605.24 Council meetings and hearings.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">605.25 Employment practices.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">605.26 Financial management.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">605.27 Recordkeeping.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>16 U.S.C. 1801 <T3>et seq.</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart A_General </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 605.1</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89"> Purpose and scope.  </ITAG>(a) This part sets forth guidelines for the development of fishery managementplans and for the organization, practices, and procedures of the Councils.(b) The definitions, word usage, and abbreviations set forth in Part 600apply within this part. <ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart B_Operations </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 605.11</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89"> General. </ITAG>The primary functions of each Council are to develop, monitor, evaluate,and propose amendments to FMPs and associated regulations for each fisherythat requires conservation and management within its geographical areaof authority. The following describes the Councils' and the Secretary'sroles and responsibilities and sets out key activities necessary to produceFMPs, amendments, and annual specifications acceptable for review by theSecretary. It is designed to_ (a) Bring to bear the necessary expertise on all aspects of the process;(b) Be responsive to other applicable law, the public interest, and shiftsin Council priorities and objectives; and (c) Ensure the quality, relevance, reliability, and independence of sciencein the management process. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 605.12</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89"> Use of available expertise. </ITAG>Councils should use all available expertise as necessary and appropriatein carrying out their functions. This includes experts within NMFS withMagnuson Act responsibilities, at State and academic institutions, Scientificand Statistical Committees (SSCs), Advisory Panels (APs), plan teams, and/orother working groups established to assist in the processes described below.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 605.13</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89"> Use of the best available scientific information. </ITAG>Management decisions must be based on the best scientific information availableconcerning the present and probable future condition of the stocks. (a) The Stock Assessment and Fishery Evaluation (SAFE) report is a documentor set of documents that provides Councils with a summary of the most recentbiological condition of species in the fishery management unit (FMU), andthe social and economic condition of the recreational and commercial fishingindustries and the fish processing industries. It summarizes, on a periodicbasis, the best scientific information concerning the past, present, andpossible future condition of the stocks and fisheries being managed underFederal regulation. (1) The Secretary has the responsibility to assure that a SAFE report isprepared, reviewed annually, and changed as necessary for each FMP. TheSecretary or Council may call on any combination of talent from Council,State, university, or other sources (but at a minimum must include Counciland NMFS representatives) to acquire and analyze data and produce the SAFEreport. (2) The SAFE report provides information for determining annual harvestlevels from each stock, documenting significant trends or changes in theresource and fishery over time, and assessing the relative success of existingState and Federal fishery management programs. In addition, the SAFE reportmay be used as a basis to update or expand previous environmental and regulatoryimpact documents, and ecosystem and habitat descriptions. (3) Each SAFE report must be scientifically based, and cite data sourcesand interpretations. (b) Each SAFE report should contain information on which to base harvestspecifications. Examples are: (1) Estimates of total biomass and/or spawning biomass for each stock inthe FMU; (2) Estimates of the annual surplus production (ASP) and maximum sustaimableyield (MSY) for each stock in the FMU; (3) Description of the estimated biomass, ASP, and MSY in previous yearsrelative to those estimates for the current or next year; (4) Description of the model or assumptions on which these estimates arebased and a discussion of the reliability of each estimate; (5) If a stock is below the level which will produce MSY, estimated timenecessary to allow a stock to rebuild to MSY, threshold or other specifiedlevel under various harvest levels, and prevailing environmental conditions;and (6) Significant changes (if any) in the habitat or ecosystem since it waslast described in the FMP, an amendment to the FMP, or previous SAFE report.(c) Each SAFE report should contain information on which to assess thecondition of the recreational and commercial fishing industries and fishprocessing industries. Examples are: (1) Estimate of the amount of fish harvested from each stock in the FMU,by gear type and area, in the most recent three years and in the year immediatelyprior to implementation of the FMP governing fisheries for (or in) theFMU. If applicable, a description of the amount of fish harvested in thesame time period by wholly domestic, joint venture and foreign fisheries;(2) The approximate ex-vessel value of the harvested fish described inparagraph (c)(1) of this section; (3) Amounts and estimated value of each type of processed products derivedfrom the harvested fish described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section;(4) Estimates of the numbers of commercial vessels by gear type and interms of individual vessels involved in each fishery for (or in) the FMU;(5) Estimates of the number of commercial fishermen employed in each fisheryfor (or in) the FMU; (6) The numbers of processing plants, floating and shore-based, individualand by product type, involved in processing the harvested fish describedin paragraph (c)(1) of this section; (7) Estimates of the amount of fish harvested by recreational fishermenfrom the FMU;(8) Estimates of the numbers of recreational fishermen who harvested fishfrom the FMU; (9) Estimates of the number of charter vessels and party boats involvedin the recreational fishery; and (10) The estimated value of the recreational fishery for (or in) the FMU.(d) Each SAFE report may contain additional economic, social, ecological,and other information pertinent to the success of management or the achievementof objectives of each FMP. Examples are: (1) Enforcement actions taken and penalties assessed and collected overthe most recent three years under an implemented FMP; (2) Significant changes (if any) in State regulations pertinent to theFMU and their known or anticipated effects on stocks in the FMU; (3) Significant changes (if any) in related fisheries which may affectthe fishing effort for (or in) the FMU; and (4) Potential conservation and management problems, their possible causesand solutions. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 605.14</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Planning. </ITAG>(a) <T3>General. </T3>Councils must establish procedures for identifying, ona continuing basis, fishery management issues and needs. The proceduresestablished must ensure consideration of, and responsiveness to, the SAFE,economic and social impact analyses, enforcement experience, public perceptionsand proposals, management priorities and long-term management goals andobjectives. In its planning process, the Councils should define the FMU,determine the need for management, identify data and information needs,examine the range of issues to be addressed, propose management objectives,and schedule future actions. (b) <T3>Data Collection Program (DCP).</T3> (1) The Magnuson Act authorizescollection of information and data which would be beneficial in determiningwhether an FMP is needed for a fishery or in preparing an FMP. Councilsmay request that the Secretary implement a DCP for a fishery which wouldprovide the types of information and data specified by the Councils. Ifthe need for data is justified for conservation and management and approvedby OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act, the Secretary will approve sucha DCP and issue proposed regulations to implement the program within 60days and establish an estimated date of availability of the data. If theSecretary determines the need for a DCP is not justified, the Council mustbe informed in writing of the reason(s) for the determination within areasonable period of time. (2) NOAA is authorized under the Magnuson Act and other statutes to collectproprietary or confidential commercial or financial information and providenonconfidential aggregations of such data to fulfill a Council's request.Information and data that would disclose proprietary or confidential commercialor financial information regarding individual fishing operators or fishprocessing operations would not be provided to the Council except as providedin andSection; 601.27 and Part 603. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 605.15</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Fishery management objectives.</ITAG>Each FMP and amendment, whether prepared by a Council or by the Secretary,should identify what the FMP is designed to achieve, i.e., the managementobjectives to be attained in regulating the fishery under consideration.(See andSection; 602.10, national standard guidelines, which sets out therole of objectives in the development and review process.) <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 605.16</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Establishment of management measures. </ITAG>(a) The Council develops management measures to achieve optimum yield (OY)and the management objectives of the Council. The Council must proposemanagement measures that are consistent with the national standards, othersections of the Magnuson Act, and other applicable law. The Council mustprepare draft regulations that implement the management measures for submissionto the Secretary with the FMP or amendment. Supporting documents requiredby other applicable law (see Part 604) must accompany the Council submission.Procedural detail may be found in the NMFS <T3>Operational Guidelines. </T3>(b) Prior to the Council's adoption of the management measures: (1) The Council must prepare a regulatory analysis of the economic andsocial effects of alternate management measures and their effectivenessin achieving the objectives in the FMP. The analysis must discuss the needfor Federal action, and the benefits and costs of each alternative, andthe effects on small entities and fishery-dependent communities. The analysismust include a conclusion concerning the expected net economic and socialbenefits to be achieved by each alternative management measure or system.To the extent such net benefits cannot be quantitative, qualitative estimatesmust be provided. (2) The SSC must advise the Council on the adequacy of all support analysesand whether they are based on the best scientific information available,and on the efficacy of proposed management measures. (3) NOAA and the Coast Guard, upon request of a Council, must provide writtencomments pertaining to the feasibility and cost of alternatives relativeto enforcement and on vessel safety implications of the management measures.(4) The Council may solicit comment from the AP, and any other interestedgroup or individual concerning the effects and probable effectiveness ofthe proposed alternatives. <ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart C_Administration </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 605.21</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89"> Council Statement of Organization, Practices, and Procedures (SOPP).</ITAG>Council SOPPs required under andSection; 601.22 must, at a minimum, implementthe standards outlined below in this subpart.

(b) <T3>Designees. </T3>(1) The Magnuson Act authorizes only the principalState officials, the Regional Directors, and the nonvoting members to designateindividuals to attend Council meetings in their absence. The Chair of theCouncil must be notified in writing, in advance of any meeting at whicha designee will initially represent the Council member, the name, address,and position of the individual designated. A designee may not name anotherdesignee. However, such officials may submit to the Chair, in advance,a list of several individuals who may act as designee, provided that thelist designates who would serve if more than one designee is in attendance.(2) Reimbursement of travel expenses to any meeting must be limited tothe member, or, in the case of the absence of the member, one designee_inany case, one person.

Proceduresfor appointing members of these groups should also be specified in theSOPPs. (1) <T3>Scientific and Statistical Committee (SSC). </T3>The SSC provides expertscientific and technical advice to the Council on the development of fisherymanagement objectives and strategies, the scientific information supportingpreparation of FMPs, the appropriateness of the ABC and OY levels, theadequacy of the regulatory analysis, and the effectiveness of FMPs oncein operation. In providing this advice, the SSC assists the Council inidentifying the need for research and data collection and the scientificresources available, and in establishing criteria for framework actions.Membership must be multidisciplinary, and should include biological andsocial scientists from the Federal and State governments, and private scientificcommunity who are knowledgeable about the fisheries to be managed. (2) <T3>Advisory Panel (AP). </T3>The AP provides pragmatic advice from individualsmost affected by, or interested in, Council matters of fishery management.A balanced representation should be maintained of those who are eitheractually engaged in harvesting, processing, marketing, or consuming fish,or knowledgeable and interested in the conservation and management of thefisheries within the Council's jurisdiction. With respect to each FMP oramendment under consideration by the Council, the AP should provide adviceconcerning the recommended OY, the management measures and allocationsunder consideration, the supporting documentation to any regulatory action,management objectives, and any other subject, as required by the Council.(e) <T3>Working groups. </T3>Fishery management planning and development ofFMPs may be performed by various types of working groups, under the directionof the Council. For example, the Council may establish a Plan Team to assessthe need for management, assemble information, conduct and evaluate analyses,evaluate public/industry proposals and comments, and estimate the costsof plan development, implementation, and monitoring. In addition, Councilsmay use ad hoc groups to address resource user conflicts or other issues.(f) <T3>Committees. </T3>The Council may appoint standing and ad hoc committeesfrom among the voting and nonvoting members as it deems necessary for theconduct of Council business.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 605.24</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Council meetings and hearings. </ITAG>In fulfilling the Council's responsibilities and functions, the Councilmembers may meet in plenary session, in working groups, or individuallyto hear statements in order to clarify issues, gather information, or makedecisions regarding material before them. To provide for review and decisionby the Secretary, recommendations of each of these groups must be documentedand available. The documentation must include, at a minimum, a statementof the problem, recommendations for corrective action, likely impact onthe affected resource, and likely impact on affected user groups. (a) <T3>Meetings_</T3>(1) <T3>General. </T3>The Councils meet in plenary session at the call of theChair or upon request of a majority of the voting members. Advisory groupsmay meet with the approval of the Chair. Emergency meetings may be heldat the call of the Chair or equivalent presiding officer. (2) <T3>Notice. </T3>With respect to the conduct of business at meetings ofa Council, and of the scientific and statistical committee and advisorypanels of a Council, timely public notice of each regular meeting and eachemergency meeting, including the time, place, and agenda of the meeting,must be published in local newspapers in the major fishing ports of theCouncil's region (and in other major fishing ports having a direct interestin the affected fishery) and such notice may be given by such other meansas will result in wide publicity. Timely notice of each regular meetingmust also be published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. (3) <T3>Conduct of meetings. </T3>(i) All meetings of the Council advisoryand working groups must be open, unless closed in accordance with paragraph(a)(5) of this section. Interested persons will be permitted to presentoral or written statements regarding the matters on the agenda at regularmeetings of the Council, within reasonable limits established by the Chair.A vote is required for Council approval or amendment of a fishery managementplan (including any proposed regulations), a Council finding that an emergencyexists involving any fishery, or Council comments to the Secretary on foreignfishing applications or fishery management plans developed by the Secretary.(ii) A majority of the voting members of any Council constitutes a quorumfor Council meetings, but one or more such members designated by the Councilmay hold hearings. (iii) Decisions of any Council are by majority vote of the voting memberspresent and voting (except for proposed removal of Council members, seeandSection;601.36). Voting by proxy is not permitted. An abstention doesnot affect the unanimity of a vote. (iv) Voting members of the Council who disagree with the majority on anyissue to be submitted to the Secretary, including principal State officialsraising federalism issues, may submit a written statement of their reasonsfor dissent. If any Council member elects to file a minority report, itmust be submitted at the same time as that of the majority. (4) <T3>Record. </T3>(i) Minutes of each meeting must be kept and must containa record of the persons present, an accurate description of matters discussedand conclusions reached, and copies of all statements filed. (ii) Subject to the procedures established by the Council under andSection;601.27,and the regulations prescribed by the Secretary under Part 603 relatingto confidentiality, the administrative record (including minutes requiredunder paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section) of each meeting, and recordsor other documents which were made available to or prepared for or by theCouncil, SSC, or APs incident to the meeting, must be available for publicinspection and copying at a single location in the offices of the Council.(5) <T3>Closed meetings. </T3>(i) Each Council, SSC, and AP: (A) Must close any meeting, or portion thereof, that concerns matters orinformation that bears a national security classification; and (B) May close any meeting, or portion thereof, that concerns matters orinformation that pertains to unclassified national security matters, employmentmatters, or briefings on litigation in which the Council is interested.(ii) Closed meetings must be announced in the news media. (6) <T3>Frequency. </T3>Each Council must meet in plenary session at leastonce every six months. Council advisory groups may meet as frequently asnecessary, with the approval of the Council Chair.(7) <T3>Location. </T3>(i) Each Council must conduct all meetings within itsgeographic area of concern. In the particular case of the North PacificCouncil, ``geographical area of concern'' means within the State of Alaska.When two or more Councils have been designated by the Secretary to preparean FMP jointly, Councils so designated may meet jointly within any of theirconstituent States for the purpose of developing or amending such a planor discussing issues of mutual concern. (ii) The Council meeting place should have a capacity large enough to accommodatethe anticipated public attendance and be accessible to those interestedin attending, including consideration of the cost of transportation andlodging. (b) <T3>Hearings_</T3>(1) <T3>General. </T3>The Magnuson Act directs the Councils to hold publichearings, at appropriate times and in appropriate locations in the geographicalarea concerned, to provide the opportunity for all interested persons tobe heard in the development of FMPs and amendments, and with respect tothe administration and implementation of the Magnuson Act. The term ``geographicalarea of concern'', for purposes of holding hearings, may include an areaunder the authority of another Council if the fish in the fishery concernedmigrate into, or occur in, that area or if the matters being heard affectfishermen of that area; but not unless such other Council is first consultedregarding the conduct of such hearings within its area. (2) <T3>Notice. </T3>Hearings must follow the same procedures for announcementas for Council and advisory group meetings. Timely public notice also shouldbe given to the local media where the hearing is to take place. Publicityshould be sufficient in time, substance, and area coverage to assure thatall interested parties are aware of the opportunity to make their viewsknown. (3) <T3>Conduct of hearings. </T3>When it is determined that a hearing is appropriate,the Chair of the Council must designate at least one voting member of theCouncil to officiate. All points of view must be given a fair chance tobe heard. (4) <T3>Record. </T3>An accurate and timely report of the participants andtheir views must be provided in writing to the Council and maintained asa part of the Council's official records. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 605.25</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Employment practices. </ITAG>The following sets forth the responsibilities of the Councils with regardto personnel matters and establishes personnel-related standards. Councilmembers (except for Federal government officials) and staff are not Federalemployees subject to Office of Personnel Management (OPM) regulations.(a) <T3>Staffing. </T3>Each Council may appoint and assign duties to an ExecutiveDirector and such other full- and part-time administrative employees asthe Secretary determines are necessary to the performance of Council functionsconsistent with budgetary limitations. The Executive Director is responsibleto the Council, and the staff is responsible to the Executive Director.Each position must be justified during the budget process described inOMB Circular A-110, or prior to filling a new position established duringthe course of the cooperative agreement year. Descriptions of the workto be performed must be submitted. (1) Council staff positions must be filled solely on the basis of merit,fitness, competence, and qualifications. Employment actions must be freefrom discrimination based on race, religion, color, national origin, sex,age, or physical handicap. (2) No employee of the Council may be deprived of employment, position,work, compensation, or benefit provided for or made possible by the MagnusonAct on account of any political activity or lack of such activity in supportof or in opposition to any candidate or any political party in any national,State, county, or municipal election, or on account of his or her politicalaffiliation. (3) Council members and staff generally have the same protection from individualtort liability as Federal employees or official actions, and are protectedby the Federal workmen's compensation statute, by the minimum wage/maximumhour provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), and by the rightsof access and confidentiality provisions of the Privacy Act (PA). (4) Council staff are eligible also for unemployment compensation in thesame manner as Federal employees. (b) <T3>Experts and consultants. </T3>As long as funding is available in itsbudget, each Council may contract with experts and consultants as neededto provide technical assistance not available from NOAA. This includeslegal assistance in clarifying issues, but Councils must contact NOAA GeneralCounsel before seeking outside legal advice. Such experts and consultantsmay not provide services on a continuing basis. (c) <T3>Details of Government employees. </T3>All Federal agencies are authorizedby section 302(f)(2) of the Magnuson Act, 16 U.S.C. 1852(f)(6), to detailpersonnel to the Council on a reimbursable basis to assist the Councilin the performance of its functions. Nonreimbursable details are not precluded.Council requests to the heads of such agencies must contain the purposeof the detail, length of time, compensation to be paid, if any, and thestipulation that the Assistant Administrator be consulted prior to grantingthe request. Copies of this correspondence will be transmitted to the AssistantAdministrator through the servicing Regional Office. Federal employeesso detailed retain all benefits, rights, and status as they are entitledto in their regular employment. The Councils may negotiate arrangementswith State or local governments to utilize employees of those governments.Assistance in arranging these details may be obtained through the servicingRegional Office. (d) <T3>Personnel actions. </T3>Subject to these instructions, and within budgetarylimits, the Councils may establish positions, recruit, hire, compensateand dismiss personnel. Dismissal will be made for misconduct, unsatisfactoryperformance, and/or lack of funds, with reasonable notice to the employee.(e) <T3>Salary and wage administration. </T3>(1) In setting rates of pay forCouncil staff, the principle of equal pay for equal work must be followed.Variations in basic rates of pay should be in proportion to substantialdifferences in the difficulty and responsibilities of the work performed.(2) A cost of living allowance may be applied to the salaries of Councilmembers and staff whose post of duty is in one of the following areas:Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, Virgin Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, andPuerto Rico. Members from American Samoa will receive post differential.The rate of cost of living allowance may not exceed that paid by the FederalGovernment in the same area. The current rates may be obtained from theapplicable NOAA field unit. (3) The duties of any new position must be contained in a brief descriptionto be submitted to the Regional Office assigned to a Council prior to thesubmission of a budget in which the salary of that position is requested.The Council will be provided a salary range appropriate to the positionand a determination of the applicability of the Fair Labor Standards Act.The Council then may fill the position at any salary level within thatrange; the policy of hiring at the beginning rate should be followed exceptin unusual cases when recruitment of an exceptionally qualified employeeis hampered thereby. The annual pay for any staff position may not exceedthe current rate for the top step of grade 15 of the Federal General Scheduleat any time. (f) <T3>Recruitment. </T3>All personnel vacancies should be filled on a competitivebasis, unless unusual circumstances clearly dictate otherwise. For thispurpose, the Council may avail itself of the vacancy advertising systemoperated by NOAA through the servicing Regional Office or any other recruitmenttool, including newspapers and local employment agencies. (g) <T3>Leave. </T3>Council employees should be granted paid leave for holidays,vacations or exigencies, sickness, and civil duties (e.g., jury duty, militaryreserve obligations) as determined by the Council. Councils should informemployees that leave is not transferable to or from Federal agencies. Leaveis subject to the following limitations: (1) <T3>Annual leave. </T3>Full-time Council employees may accrue annual leaveat rates not to exceed those for Federal employees. Part-time employeesaccrue leave at the same rate, per hours worked. (i)(A) Up to three years of service_maximum of 2 hours leave per 40 hours(13 days per year); (B) Three to 15 years_maximum of 3 hours per 40 hours (20 days per year);and (C) Over 15 years: maximum of 4 hours per 40 hours (26 days per year).(ii) If the Council so desires, it may credit prior Federal, State, orlocal government service for the purpose of determining leave accrual ofindividual employees. Application of such a policy must be uniform andpublic. (iii) Employees may carry over up to 240 hours (30 days) unused annualleave from one calendar year to the next. Amounts remaining above 240 hourswill be forfeited. Employees who were authorized to carry over more than240 hours in accordance with Council SOPPs prior to the effective dateof these guidelines may continue under such policy. Under certain conditions,forfeited annual leave may be restored if it was properly scheduled foruse and circumstances beyond the employee's control caused the forfeiture.Approval for this restoration must be obtained from the Council Chair orhis/her designee, who will refer to the NOAA Personnel Regulations andother source documents for guidance. Lump sum reimbursements not to exceed240 hours carryover plus current year earnings of unused leave are authorizedupon employee separation. (Councils should neither budget nor account separatelyfor anticipated or accrued leave costs payable upon employee separation.Should such costs arise and exceed Council funding availability, NOAA willdefray these costs in total.) (2) <T3>Sick leave. </T3>(i) Full-time Council employees may accrue sick leaveat the rate of two hours per week (13 days per year). Part-time employeesmay accrue at a percentage of the hours worked compared to 40 hours. A20-hour-a-week employee would accrue half the leave accrued by a 40-hour-a-weekemployee. Accumulation is without limits. Lump sum payments upon separationare not authorized. However, unused sick leave may be credited, upon anemployee's retirement, as additional time worked. (ii) In meritorious cases, Councils may advance up to one year's earningsof sick or annual leave when it is reasonably expected that the advancedleave will be repaid by the employee. This must be approved by the CouncilChair or designee (designation must be in writing). (h) <T3>Employee benefits. </T3>Employee benefits are identified in Councils'SOPP, a copy of which should be provided to each employee. The Councilshould provide its employees the opportunity to participate in group medicalinsurance, life insurance, and retirement plans, and pay a reasonable proportionof the cost of such plans. Total employee benefits may not exceed 20 percent(exclusive of FICA) of employees' gross salary, without NOAA approval.(1) <T3>Medical insurance. </T3>Councils may provide group medical and dentalinsurance to their employees either through a commercial underwriter orthrough a State or local government program, within the total percentagelimitation previously stated. Councils are not authorized to increase employeesalaries in lieu of a medical or dental insurance plan. (2) <T3>Life insurance. </T3>Councils may provide group life insurance foremployees within the total percentage limitation previously stated. Anincrease in salary in lieu of insurance coverage is not authorized. (i) <T3>Travel Reimbursement_</T3>(1) <T3>General. </T3>(i) Each Council must include travel reimbursement procedures in its SOPP.Current per diem and actual subsistence rates contained in the NOAA TravelHandbook apply. (ii) Actual expenses include transportation by air coach, rail coach, busor privately owned vehicle (automobile or private plane reimbursed on aper mile basis); room and meals within a reasonable limit established bythe NOAA Travel Handbook; and incidental expenses such as taxi fares, parking,and telephone calls on official business.(iii) Coach air transportation must be utilized when available. Travelvia first class air must be justified on the reimbursement voucher andapproved by the Council Chair or his/her authorized representative. Privatelyowned vehicles (POVs) may be authorized when other modes of transportationare either unavailable or inconvenient. When a POV is authorized for theconvenience of the traveler, the reimbursed costs must not exceed the costsof coach air fare. Accommodations equivalent to other-than-first-classshould be utilized in the unlikely event that water vessel transportationis required. When substantial savings can be realized by utilizing railtravel, this mode of transportation should be considered when availableand adequate. (2) <T3>Council, AP, SSC Members. </T3>Section 302 (d) and (f) of the MagnusonAct provide that the voting members of each Council, the Executive Directorof the Marine Fisheries Commission on each Council, the additional non-votingmember of the Pacific Council, and members of advisory groups will be reimbursedfor actual expenses incurred in the performance of Council duties. Theyare not bound by the separate per diem limits for meals and lodging asset forth in the GSA Rules. They are subject, however, to the total reimbursementlimits established by the Handbook for actual expenses, and they must itemizetheir actual expenses up to the specified limit each day. Lodging receiptsare required. The rates are included in the GSA Rules. Federal employeesserving in the above capacities are subject to the reimbursement rulesof their agencies. (3) <T3>Council staff, members of plan teams, and others. </T3>Members of theCouncil staff and plan teams, invited experts, consultants, or others specificallyinvited, unlike those described in paragraph (i)(2) of this section, mustadhere to the per diem limits or actual expense requirements set forthin the GSA Rules. (4) <T3>Non-NOAA team members. </T3>Non-NOAA team members may be reimbursedfor travel expenses but receive no other compensation from the Council.(j) <T3>Foreign travel. </T3>(1) Foreign travel must be approved, in advance,by the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries or designee and by the GrantsOfficer. Requests for foreign travel approval should be submitted, in writing,at least 15 days in advance to the Assistant Administrator, through theNMFS Office of Management and Budget and the Grants Officer. Routine across-the-bordertravel to Mexico and Canada is exempt. (2) Each Council should specify in its SOPP any delegation of authorityto approve routine across-the-border travel which has been granted to itby NOAA. (3) Council Chairmen or their authorized representatives may approve routineacross-the-border travel to Canada or Mexico for Council members and employeeswithin specified Federal rates. (4) Domestic invitational travel for non-Council personnel may be approvedby the Council Chairman or his/her authorized representative. Foreign invitationaltravel must be approved as described in paragraph (j)(1) of this section.The per diem limits or actual expense requirements described above alsoare applicable to non-Council personnel traveling at Council expense. Paymentfor NOAA personnel from Council funds is not authorized. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 601.26</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Financial management. </ITAG>The Councils' administrative operations are governed by OMB Circular A-110(Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements with Institutionsof Higher Education, Hospitals, and other Non-Profit Organizations) andOMB Circular A-122 (Cost Principles for Non-Profit Organizations). A-110prescribes standards for financial management systems, procurement, propertymanagement, financial reporting, cash depositories, and grant close-outprocedures. Councils are required to comply strictly with the provisionsof the Circulars, DOC regulations and directives, NOAA directives, andterms and conditions of the awards. (a) <T3>Cooperative agreements. </T3>Councils receive funds through cooperativeagreements for two basic types of expenditures: Administrative (or operations)funds to cover general operating expenses, such as salaries, office space,utilities, travel, State liaison activities, etc., and programmatic (orcontract) funds primarily designed to fund contracts generated by the Councilsfor development of FMPs (including amendments) or FMP-oriented information.(1) <T3>Administrative. </T3>The funding for the administrative and technicalsupport of Council operations is included in the budget of the Departmentof Commerce and, through that agency, in the budgets of NOAA and NMFS.The funding requirements for the Councils are subject to regular budgetaryreview procedures. Annual grants and cooperative agreements will providesuch Federal funds as the Secretary determines are necessary to the performanceof the functions of the Councils and consistent with budgetary limitations.Requirements for periodic reports for purposes of NOAA budgetary controlare described in individual grants and cooperative agreements issued tothe Councils. (i) <T3>Application for cooperative agreement. </T3>(A) The Council must submita formal application (Standard Form 424, Federal Assistance Short Form)to the appropriate Regional Director. This application includes a BudgetData Form, a Program Narrative Statement supporting the application, anda Statement of General Assurances. As backup to the Budget Data Form, eachCouncil must prepare a Budget Summary Worksheet for three fiscal/calendaryears. The amounts reflected in lines A1 through A8 of the Worksheet arethen transferred to the appropriate categories of the Budget Data Form.On the budget submission, Councils should list all contemplated equipmentpurchases over $500 each; approval of the application will convey approvalof these purchases. The Program Narrative Statement should describe inappropriate detail the purpose for which funds are sought, e.g., operationalexpenses, FMP-oriented contracts, State liaison support. (B) Upon receiving a recommendation from the Regional Director (RD), theAssistant Administrator will review the application and transmit the applicationthrough the RD to the appropriate Grants Officer for processing. If theapplication is disapproved by the Assistant Administrator, the RD willbe contacted and supplied with the reasons for disapproval and the criteriafor resubmission.(ii) <T3>Accounting. </T3>A Cash Receipts and Disbursement Journal with a monthlySummary of Accounts is required as a minimum bookkeeping system. In addition,a Statement of Income and Expenses for the Council must be prepared monthlyfor the Council membership. Each cash disbursement must be approved bythe Council Executive Director. All checks for amounts more than $5,000require two signatures_the Council Executive Director and another persondesignated by the Council. The approval authority must be included in anySOPP published after the effective date of this regulation. When budgetestimates are submitted to the Assistant Administrator, the uniform accountclassification titles should be used. (iii) <T3>Advance of funds. </T3>A Letter of Credit will be established for eachcooperative agreement. Drawdowns from the Treasury will be made at thecommercial bank through electronic fund transfer from Treasury. The Councilshall initiate each drawdown at approximately the same time that checksare issued by the Council in payment of Council liabilities. Drawdownsshould not be made more frequently than daily or in amounts less than $10,000.These requirements are under the Department of the Treasury Circular 1075,``Withdrawal of Cash from the Treasury for Advances Under Federal Grantsand Other Programs'' (31 CFR Part 205). (2) <T3>Programmatic_</T3>(i) <T3>Nature of request. </T3>Councils may enter into cooperative agreementswith Federal agencies, State, and private institutions on matters of mutualinterest which further the objectives of the Magnuson Act. Approval fromthe Secretary of Commerce must be obtained prior to entering into sucharrangements, and each agreement must specify the nature and extent ofCouncil participation. The Councils are not authorized to accept giftsor contributions directly. All such donations must be directed to the NOAAAdministrator in accordance with Agency regulations, which are availablefrom NMFS Regional Offices upon request. (ii) <T3>Criteria. </T3>NOAA has established the following criteria to guideeach year's decisions on programmatic funding: (A) Proposed projects must be directly related to the formulation of anFMP, amendment, or emergency action (including data collection necessaryto determine whether an FMP should be formulated); necessary to evaluatean FMP already in place; or, necessary to obtain information for use inframework FMP management actions. (B) Proposed projects must be short-term, preferably one year or less butgenerally not longer than two years. (C) Proposed projects must avoid duplication of effort and operate as costefficiently as possible in order to maximize benefits for Federal expenditures.When a Council has identified data needs for a particular fishery, availableresources from NOAA, the States, Office of Sea Grant, academic institutions,and other established sources of information should be utilized to avoidduplication of effort. If certain biological, ecological, economic, orsocial data is needed on a high-priority basis which cannot readily besupplied free-of-charge by NMFS or other institutions, the Councils maybe authorized to contract for the information collection and analysis.The SSC of each Council should assist in identifying immediate and longer-rangeresearch and data needs. (iii) <T3>Procedure. </T3>(A) Requests for programmatic funding may be submittedat the same time as the Council's administrative budget, or at other timesas requested by the Assistant Administrator. Documentation should includea cover letter explaining the need for the project, how it contributesto an FMP (proposed, developing or existing), and how it meets criteriaoutlined in this section. An additional factor that is considered duringNOAA review is documentation jointly submitted by the Regional Directorand Chief Scientist stating that needed information is not available fromNOAA or other sources and establishing regional priorities among the variousCouncil requests. (B) Competing project proposals which meet the above criteria may be fundedbased on an evaluation of urgency of problem to be addressed, impact offailing to fund, impact of delay in funding, and importance and size offishery. (C) Programmatic contract services always must be described in the contextof overall Council plans in a particular programmatic area. The relationshipof individual contracts to past and projected goals must be reflected inall Council applications for contract funds. (b) <T3>Procurement. </T3>Draft contracts or solicitations relating to thedevelopment or monitoring of FMPs must be submitted to the RD. Proposedsole source procurements over $5,000 and contracts for automated data processing(ADP) equipment purchases and leases must also be submitted to the RD priorto award. Solicitations will not be released, nor contracts awarded, untilall substantive issues noted by the RD have been satisfactorily resolved.Proposed sole source contracts over $10,000 must be approved in writingby the Grants Officer. Final copies of all contracts awarded will be filedwith the appropriate Grants Officer. The cost and financial managementprinciples outlined in OMB Circulars A-122 and A-110 are to be appliedfully to all Council procurement actions. (1) To avoid duplication of work, efforts must be made to use existingsupport sources (Federal, State, other Councils, etc.) before commercialsources are sought. (2) Competition must be held for all commercial purchases over $5,000 unlessthe unique nature of the procurement, unforeseen time constraints, and/orsubstantiated overall savings (administrative plus contractual) clearlydictate otherwise. All sole source procurements above $5,000 with individualsand commercial vendors will be documented and reviewed by the RD as describedabove. Such purchases over $10,000 must be approved by the Grants Officer.Internal Council evaluations may be made on unusual and large procurementsto ensure their legality, economy, and viability, or the Council may delegatesuch authorization to its Executive Director or Chair. (3) Efforts must be made to inform minority firms of planned Council procurements.The <T3>Commerce Business Daily </T3>(CBD) should be considered by each Councilas a means of publicizing contemplated contracts. (4) The purchase or lease of ADP equipment by Councils and its subcontractorsrequires prior approval by the RD. Such approval will be made only aftera cost-benefit analysis (system life cost, lease vs. purchase, compatibility,etc.) by the Council demonstrates the economy of the proposed action. (5) Councils are authorized to purchase supplies and services from GSAdirectly. Individual accounts have been set up for each Council, and informationis available through Regional Offices. (c) <T3>Property management. </T3>A listing of Federally-owned (Council) propertymust be submitted to the Grants Officer annually. Theft of Council propertyshould be reported promptly to local law enforcement personnel, includingthe FBI, the Grants Officer, and to the Regional Office. Property managementprocedures must ensure adequate control and protection of Council propertyat all times. Such procedures are included in Council's SOPP, and mustinclude the following as a minimum:(1) A perpetual inventory system for all nonexpendable items, e.g., officeequipment, furniture, etc.; (2) Procedures for marking such items as Council property; (3) Provision for safeguarding sensitive items such as cameras and biologicalequipment. Insurance should not be obtained. (4) Procedures to be followed in disposing of surplus items; (5) Listing of all personnel, including consultants if appropriate, authorizedto have access to Council property. (d) <T3>Space management. </T3>In all cases, reason should be exercised regardingthe amount and cost of space acquired. When acquiring office space, Councilsmay avail themselves of the following: (1) General Services Administration leasing assistance; (2) Regional Office assistance; (3) Direct negotiations within the guidelines stated above. (e) <T3>Accounting system. </T3>Councils must maintain a document-oriented,obligation-accounting system (with accruals, as necessary, for budget projectionpurposes) rather than a cash-accounting system. Actual journals and ledgersmust be maintained either manually or on an automated system; in eithercase, however, all obligations must be clearly documented and organizedin order to provide quick access and verification by professional auditors.The actual composition (chart of accounts) of the system may vary somewhatfrom Council to Council. As a minimum, however, the system must providefiscal control over expenditures in line with those object classes depictedin the Council budget submission. This will allow not only timely submissionof the periodic financial status reports, but it will also ensure closecoordination between actual spending rates and budgeted amounts so thatcomparisons and changes can be made at any time. All financial recordsmust be handled in accordance with OMB Circular A-110. (f) <T3>Audits. </T3>An independent audit is required at least biennially byDOC auditors or an independent public accountant (IPA). All Councils aresubject to audit by the Secretary and the General Accounting Office. Thescope of the audit may include: conduct of financial operations; compliancewith applicable laws and regulations; economy and efficiency of administrativeprocedures; and achievement of results. (1) If an IPA is to perform the audit, the request for proposals and contractmust comply with the Audit Guidelines. (2) As part of the IPA's examination of Council records, it is requestedthat they comment on whether efforts have been made by the Council to includesmall, minority, and women-owned businesses as sources of supplies andservices. (3) In order to provide guidance or provide additional information to theauditors and the Councils on audit-related matters, it is suggested thatthe following NOAA personnel be invited to participate in the audit exitconference: (i) The Grants Officer; (ii) The Assistant Administrator's staff and/or a representative of theRegional Office; (g) <T3>Financial reports. </T3>Reports are required which summarize totalexpenditures made and Federal funds unexpended for each award, and thestatus of Federal cash received. The Report of Federal Cash Transactions(Form SF-272) is required from each Council quarterly and is due to theGrants Officer no later than 30 working days after the end of the quarter.A final report is required upon completion of the grant, to be submittedwithin 90 days after completion of the grant. The Financial Status Report(Form SF-269) is required from each Council quarterly and is due to theGrants Officer no later than 30 working days after the end of the quarter.A final report is required 90 days following completion of the grant. Guidancefor the preparation of these reports and other financial reporting proceduresis in Attachment G of OMB Circular A-110. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 605.27</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Recordkeeping. </ITAG>(a) <T3>Administrative records for FMPs. </T3>(1) Councils and NMFS Headquarters,Regions and Centers collectively are responsible for maintaining recordspertaining to the development of FMPs and amendments within their geographicarea of authority. In the event of litigation, compilation of an administrativerecord for a court case will be under the direction of the NOAA GeneralCounsel. (2) Categories of documents which generally constitute an administrativerecord include the following: (i) Council meeting agendas; (ii) Minutes of Council meetings; (iii) Plan Team reports, if any; (iv) SSC reports; (v) AP reports; (vi) Hearing reports; (vii) Council reports/recommendations; (viii) Correspondence relating to the FMP; (ix) Scoping comments; (x) Work plan, if any; (xi) Discussion papers, if any; (xii) NEPA documents; (xiii) Regulatory analyses (xiv) PRA justification (xv) Proposed regulations; (xvi) Final regulations; (xvii) Emergency regulations; and (xviii) Notices of meetings (Council, SSC, AP, Team). (b) <T3>Disposition of records. </T3>(1) The goal of an effective dispositionprogram is annually to destroy at least enough unneeded records to equalthe volume of records created, while preserving records having long-termor enduring value because of administrative, legal, scientific, or historicalimportance. (2) Councils must consult with NOAA before destroying Council records.Financial records (including time and attendance records) should be handledaccording to the stipulations of OMB Circular A-110. Councils must sendrecords associated with FMPs to the appropriate Region for disposition.(3) All records and documents created or received by Council employeeswhile in active duty status belong to the Federal Government. When employeesleave the Council, they cannot take the original or file copies of recordswith them; to do so violates Federal law. (c) <T3>Permanent records. </T3>The designation of a file as ``permanent''means that the records are appropriate for offer to the National Archiveswhen 15 years old, unless otherwise specified. Destruction of permanentrecords is not authorized. The following are examples of permanent files:(1) <T3>EIS files: </T3>Documents relating EIS's or environmental assessments.Cut off at end of calendar year when created. Permanent retention; no approveddisposition at this time.(2) <T3>Annual report files: </T3>Input for the DOC Annual Reports and relatedcorrespondence. Cut off at end of calendar year when created; permanent.(3) <T3>Meeting files: </T3>Including agendas, minutes, reports, studies andrelated correspondence. Cut off at end of calendar year; permanent. (d) <T3>Privacy Act (PA) records. </T3>Each Council will maintain in its office,under appropriate safeguards in accordance with the PA, personnel fileson employees, experts and consultants under contract, and advisory groupmembers. (1) <T3>Maintenance. </T3>A file for each Council member containing appointmentpapers, security reports, biographical data and other official papers willbe centrally maintained in NOAA under security and safeguard conditionsrequired of files subject to the PA. This file will be available to membersto which it pertains on request, and to other members and government officialswhen a need to know the information in the performance of the requester'sofficial duties is established. (2) <T3>Protection. </T3>The PA provides the following protection for individuals,including Council employees, except as otherwise limited by law: (i) An individual is permitted to determine what records pertaining tohim/her are collected, maintained, used, or disseminated. (ii) An individual is permitted to prevent records pertaining to him/her,which have been obtained for a particular purpose, from being used or madeavailable for another purpose without his/her consent. (iii) An individual is permitted to gain access to information in Federalrecords pertaining to him/her, to have a copy made of all or any portionof such records, and to correct or amend such records. (iv) The collection, maintenance, use, or dissemination of any record ofidentifiable personal information must be in a manner which assures thatsuch action is for a necessary and lawful purpose, that the informationis current and accurate for its intended use, and that adequate safeguardsare provided to prevent misuse of such information. (v) Exemption from the requirements of the PA are permitted only in thosecases where there is an important public need for such exemption as hasbeen determined by specific statutory authority. (vi) Federal agencies are subject to civil suit for any damage which occursas a result of willful or intentional action which violates any individual'srights under the PA. (3) <T3>Request for PA information. </T3>Any time an individual is asked toprovide information about himself/herself to be maintained in a PA record,the individual must be given a written statement for his/her retentionwhich provides the following information: (i) The authority (law or executive order) which authorizes the collectionof the information, indicating whether the authority either imposes orauthorizes any penalty for failing to answer; whether providing the informationis mandatory or voluntary; (ii) The principal purpose for which the information is to be used; and(iii) Any other uses which may be made of the information. These uses mustbe limited to those published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, and the effect(s), if any, on the individualof not providing all or any of the requested information, both beneficialand adverse. (4) <T3>Disclosure of PA records. </T3>The disclosure of PA records to theindividual to whom they pertain, to a person accompanying the individual,to the parent of a minor, or to a legal guardian comprise a fundamentalaspect of the Act. Otherwise, Councils may only disclose PA records underone of eleven situations outlined in NOAA Circular 75-82. (5) <T3>Disposition of PA records. </T3>Councils must contact NOAA for guidancebefore disposing of PA records. Examples of PA records with recommendedtimeframes for disposition are as follows: (i) Membership files: Containing biographical data on members. Cut offwhen member leaves Committee; destroy five years later. (ii) Time and attendance files: Retain for three years following the finalfinancial report for each grant year in accordance with OMB Circular A-110.(e) <T3>Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). </T3>All FOIA requests must be submittedin writing. The envelope and letter should be clearly marked ``Freedomof Information Request.''(1) <T3>Requests. </T3>(i) FOIA requests should be time-and-date stamped uponreceipt. Each request must be acknowledged within 10 working days and filledas expeditiously as possible. Time limits for processing FOIA requestsstart upon receipt of the request for information. In unusual circumstances,the 10-day time limit may be extended up to an additional 10 working days.Discretion should be used in invoking the 1- to 10-day extension provision.Any extension reduces availability by the same number of days of an extensionthat otherwise can be invoked, if partial or full denial should resultin an appeal. (ii) FOIA requests received by a Council should be coordinated promptlywith the Regional Office. The Region will coordinate logging the FOIA requestand obtain clearance from the NOAA General Counsel concerning initial determinationfor release or denial of information (under paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of thissection. (iii) FOIA requests will be controlled and documented in the Region bycompletion of Form CD-244. Councils may obtain copies of this three-partform from the NOAA Logistics Supply Center at Kansas City or from localGSA stores, and assist the Regional Office in completing the form as wellas in assigning an official response date. Copies of the CD-244 shouldbe distributed to the Regional Director (white copy) and the Council (yellowcopy), and an information copy with the incoming request should be providedto the NMFS FOIA Officer. (iv) Councils should recover allowable costs for locating and reproducinginformation released under the FOIA and forward these funds through theNOAA Freedom of Information Officer to the U.S. Treasury. Appropriate chargesare outlined in the DOC Uniform Schedule of Fees. (2) <T3>Initial denials. </T3>(i) The purpose of the FOIA is to make availableto the public all information requested, with some exceptions in nine categoriesof information. Each Council may determine who may disclose unclassifiedinformation in its possession. However, only the Assistant Administratorhas been delegated authority to make initial determinations on whetherto deny information requested under the FOIA. This authority may not beredelegated. Regions must keep Councils informed. (ii) Proposals to deny, or partially deny, a request for information shouldbe coordinated with the appropriate Regional Attorney who will, in turn,coordinate with the DOC's Office of General Counsel, and with NOAA's Officeof Public Affairs, and NOAA's FOIA Office. No initial denial may be issueduntil the concurrence of the Department's Office of General Counsel hasbeen obtained. (iii) After the coordination mentioned in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of thissection, the Assistant Administrator must send a letter to the requestingparty denying the request for information. The denial letter should includethe following: (A) The specific exemption(s) which apply and why they apply. (B) In the case of a partial denial, a statement of the specific mannerin which a portion of a record is being provided after deletion of theportions which are determined to be exempt. (C) A statement of the right to appeal to the DOC General Counsel within30 days of the receipt of the denial. (D) A statement that the appeal should include a copy of the original request,the initial denial, the requester's reasons why the records should be madeavailable, and the reasons why the initial denial is believed to be inerror. (E) Copies of the letter of denial, along with the original FOIA request,should be sent to the DOC Office of General Counsel, the NOAA FOIA Officer,and the NMFS FOIA Officer.<ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 88-12987 Filed 6-9-88; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 3510-22-M 94andpara; </ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
