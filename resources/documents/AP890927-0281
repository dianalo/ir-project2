But the final accord still grossly understated the actual amountof oil the cartel is believed to be producing, and at least threemembers said they would refuse to recognize the deal.   Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, already producing beyondtheir assigned limits, said they had no plans to restrain theirpumping. Algeria declared the deal illegal.   OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman said the group would raise itsoutput ceiling by a million barrels a day to 20.5 million barrels,from 19.5 million, for the final three months of the year. Variousestimates put OPEC's actual production at closer to 22.5 millionbarrels a day.   The meeting of the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries ended in confusion after the ministers failed to resolvetheir deep divisions. Several countries reportedly had asked for abigger share of the pie.   Crude oil prices fluctuated during the talks as investorsawaited a decision.   Some analysts predicted the cartel's decision would translateinto even higher production and dampen prices.   Fergus MacLeod, analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in London,said, ``It means oil prices could weaken a bit from now on.''   ``On the consumer side, it may portend slightly lower prices,''said Michael Rothman, analyst at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets inNew York.   West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude, was off abouta dime at midday but closed 6 cents higher at $19.59 a barrel onthe New York Mercantile exchange.   A basket of crudes monitored by OPEC had been trading about adollar off the cartel's target of $18 a 42-gallon barrel.   Lukman said the extra production would be dividedproportionately among all 13 members. Each country's quota, orsupply target, would be raised by a certain amount.   Lukman said the arrangement should mean slightly lowerproduction. ``We'll see a lot better prices,'' he predicted.   Indonesia's oil minister Ginandjar Kartasasmita said he feltpositive about the agreement.   ``The others are worried prices will go down,'' he said. ``Ithink at the minimum they will stay level.''   Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have been ignoring theirquotas to press their demands for bigger shares.   Ali Khalifa al-Sabah, the Kuwaiti oil minister, said he made nocommitments ``either legal or moral to anybody'' to hold downproduction.   The United Arab Emirates' Mana Saeed Otaiba said he did notintend to go along with the deal, according to Ginandjar.   Sabah predicted demand would rise to 23 million barrels a day inthe October-December quarter.   ``Hopefully,'' he said, ``that will keep prices at very near(OPEC's) reference price.''   Others, however, have estimated demand for OPEC oil at 22million barrels.   The decision to increase the ceiling was made after theministers struggled for a day with a surprise Iranian plan to solvethe output demands of Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates.   After failing to do so they settled on the stopgap measure.   Immediately after the decision was announced, the head of theAlgerian delegation, who demanded anonymity, said, ``It issomething that Algeria doesn't associate itself with.''   ``It is a decision that is illegal,'' he said, adding it wasbased on ``poor thinking.''   The Algerian minister, Sadek Boussena, returned to Algiers onMonday to attend a legislative meeting. Before his departure, hehad urged the participants to concentrate on getting prices up tothe cartel's $18 target.   The ministers were at odds throughout the meeting over how muchthey could raise any production ceiling without sending pricessliding.   OPEC Secretary-General Subroto said that if prices tumbled much,the ministers would gather again. OPEC has already planned ameeting for November to plan production strategy for 1990.   The ministers said they intended to take up the Iranian planagain at that meeting.   Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh said his proposal wouldraise the supply ceiling to 21.5 million barrels a day. This, hesaid, would satisfy the demands of Kuwait, the United ArabEmirates, Gabon and Ecuador for bigger slices of the production pie.   Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq and Qatar would retain their currentshares. All others would lose some.   ``This would be the basis to solve the problems of OPEChopefully for good,'' Aqazadeh said.   He said Libya and the United Arab Emirates could not immediatelygo along with the plan. Libya has demanded the same share as Kuwait.   Each country is assigned an individual quota, based on a formulaof percentages. For example, Saudi Arabia, the cartel's No. 1producer, has nearly a 25 percent share of the total supply.   Several OPEC members, such as Kuwait and the UAE, believe theyare entitled to larger quotas based on production capacity.   OPEC members include Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran,Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United ArabEmirates and Venezuela.</TEXT></DOC>
