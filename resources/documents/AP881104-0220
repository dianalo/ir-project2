Tutu, leader of the Anglican Church in southern Africa and winnerof the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize, made the comments in Nairobi whileattending the annual conference of the All-Africa Council ofChurches.   He is council president and chairman.   Tutu did not mention either Democrat Michael Dukakis orRepublican George Bush by name. He also did not single out policiesadvocated by either candidate that would be harmful or helpful toblacks in South Africa.   The Reagan administration preferred a policy on South Africa thatbecame known as constructive engagement _ dialogue with thewhite-led Pretoria government rather than the diplomatic andeconomic confrontational tactics pursued by former DemocraticPresident Jimmy Carter.   Tutu said President Reagan's policy had failed.   ``We are now virtually being ruled by martial law,'' he said.   The archbishop said South African authorities had declared astate of emergency three times during Reagan's tenure at the WhiteHouse. During that period, he said, more than 2,000 people werekilled, many by security forces.   Tutu is a key activist against apartheid, the policy of racialsegregation under which South Africa's 26 million blacks have novote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economyand maintain separate districts, schools and health services.</TEXT></DOC>
