So when Dandamp;R Associates telephoned him saying it could recoup his losses, he leaped at the opportunity.    &quot;The guy said he could get silver so cheap and sell it for so much more that he could get all my money back,&quot; Mr. Jagnecki says. &quot;Like a stupid fool, I believed him.&quot;    From December 1985 to February 1986, Mr. Jagnecki, a 73-year-old retired farmer from Freesoil, Mich., sent seven payments totaling $27,000 to Dandamp;R in North Miami. He never got a nickel back. Dandamp;R, it turns out, was itself a boiler room that preyed on former Wellington investors, according to criminal charges filed in Dade County Circuit Court by the state prosecutor's office.    It may seem that a victim burned by one fraud would be twice wary with future investments, but many people repeatedly fall prey to scam artists. Some become repeat victims out of misplaced trust in a particular salesperson. Others may continue to invest with the same firm as a way of denying to themselves that they are being bilked. Often, like Mr. Jagnecki, victims are lured back by the prospect of recovering their losses.    &quot;It's not uncommon for people to invest again and again,&quot; says Terree Bowers, chief of the major frauds section of the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles. &quot;There's a sense that if I can find a legitimate firm, I can make money in this.&quot;    A former salesman who worked in boiler rooms from coast to coast says, &quot;It's like the guy who goes to Vegas to the 21 or craps tables. He's losing, but he keeps playing because he thinks there's a chance of winning it back.&quot; The salesman says he is &quot;rehabilitated&quot; since an arrest and doesn't want his name used.    The willingness of burned investors to gamble again makes boiler-room operators eager to target them. The former salesman says he sometimes would tote customer lists from one boiler-room job to the next and solicit clients he'd already defrauded -- using a new name and a new accent. Some firms compile and sell &quot;sucker lists&quot; of people known to buy by telephone, sometimes with information on their income and investment tastes.    Many scam artists will feign sympathy for a victim's past investment troubles, sometimes mentioning an earlier fraud to disarm them, investigators say. &quot;They'll make a direct tie-in to a previous scheme, saying, 'Yeah, we know those guys, we helped put them out of business,'&quot; says Kent C. Neal, chief of the economic crime unit of the Broward County state attorney's office in Fort Lauderdale.    Indeed, Mr. Jagnecki says he was fooled by Dandamp;R in part because the caller seemed knowledgeable about his Wellington investment. The Florida comptroller's office says Dandamp;R solicitors either posed as agents of the state attorney general's office authorized to help Wellington victims recoup losses or claimed that they could buy silver at below-market prices and sell it at a profit.    In January, four people, including two former Wellington salesmen, were charged in the Dandamp;R case in Dade County Circuit Court with racketeering, organized fraud, grand theft, fraudulent securities sales and operating a boiler room. All four have pleaded innocent; the charges are pending.    But even since the Dandamp;R and Wellington episodes, Mr. Jagnecki has put money into various deals solicited by telephone. Early last month, he was told he had been selected by computer as a winner of five American Eagle gold coins -- but he had to send in $349 to claim his prize, for reasons he still isn't clear on. As of yesterday, no gold coins had arrived.    &quot;They come up with a high-falutin story,&quot; he says of the salesmen who have exploited him. &quot;You've almost just got to believe them.&quot; He adds: &quot;You just keep on biting.&quot;    Dee L. Pace, a 78-year-old retiree in Twin Falls, Idaho, blames a series of bad investments on &quot;just plain dumbness.&quot; One mistake was placing &quot;a lot of confidence&quot; in a telephone saleswoman who led him through a series of soured investments in at least three shady firms, including Wellington Precious Metals. &quot;She seemed very interested in my behalf,&quot; he says. &quot;I thought she knew what she was doing.&quot;    Mr. Pace also was defrauded by a firm that, like Dandamp;R, preyed on an earlier boiler room's victims, according to Florida authorities. The state comptroller's office says First New York Group Inc. in Fort Lauderdale specialized in targeting former customers of McCarthy andamp; McCarthy, a defunct North Miami precious metals firm that failed to make delivery on orders and is under investigation by the state. In 1986, Mr. Pace made a $10,000 deposit for platinum from McCarthy andamp; McCarthy, which closed without refunding his investment.    First New York's sales pitch was that it had access to McCarthy customers' metals and could sell their unreceived orders if customers would send money to buy more metal. Papers filed by state prosecutors in Dade County Circuit Court in Miami allege that after victims sent money, they were stalled and sent phony wire confirmations.    Gregory Francis Long, a director of First New York who authorities say previously worked at McCarthy andamp; McCarthy, and John Edward McDougall, a First New York salesman, have been charged in Dade County Circuit Court with grand theft and securities violations. They pleaded innocent to the charges; lawyers for the pair say they won't comment.    Mr. Long called Mr. Pace last April, saying First New York could sell his McCarthy stake if he'd buy 25 more ounces of platinum -- to round out his holdings to a size a buyer sought, Mr. Pace says. &quot;He said, 'I can get all your money for you in 48 hours if you wire me a check for $4,400,'&quot; Mr. Pace says. &quot;I was a little skeptical, but the man convinced me. He said, 'I've got a market for it,' and I just believed him. Nothing ever happened.&quot;    Mr. Pace has had many other investment troubles. Last September, he sent a check to Numismatic Coins Ltd. in Melville, N.Y., for some silver coins. &quot;After I sent $2,153 for some choice coins, I couldn't even get them on the phone,&quot; he says. The U.S. Postal Inspection Service says Numismatic Coins, which has gone out of business, is under investigation for fraud.    Mr. Pace now says he is finished being bilked. &quot;No one could ever sell me anything by phone.&quot;    Some victims are reluctant to accept that they have been swindled and continue sending money to a boiler room &quot;because they have a stake in the investment,&quot; says Mr. Neal of the Broward County state attorney's office. Albert Krieger, a 68-year-old retiree in Gackle, N.D., says over the course of a year starting in August 1985, he invested $300,000 in some 11 oil partnerships through Miller andamp; McKinzie in Fort Lauderdale. &quot;When you're in that deep,&quot; he says, &quot;you don't want to believe you're in a bad investment.&quot;    Mr. Krieger continued to invest even though the saleswoman offered only excuses for why his prior ventures hadn't started paying off. He says the saleswoman &quot;painted a beautiful picture&quot; of the oil deals and criticized his other investments. &quot;She always told me that anything I'd invested in doesn't come near the possible profits this had.&quot; He liquidated stocks and bonds to invest in the oil ventures.    Eventually, Miller andamp; McKinzie closed, and its owner pleaded guilty in Broward County Circuit Court to charges of racketeering and unlawful operation of a boiler room. Mr. Krieger now heads a group of investors trying to recover their funds through a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Dallas. </TEXT></DOC>
