The defense begins presenting its case Monday at North's trialon charges ranging from lying to Congress to receiving an illegalgratuity.   While prosecutors were presenting their side over the last sixweeks, North's lawyers brought out a number of secret actions takenby Reagan while in the White House on behalf of the Contra rebelsfighting to overthrow Nicaragua's Sandinista government.   But that failed to persuade U.S. District Judge Gerhard A.Gesell that Reagan should be called to the stand as requested byNorth's lawyers.   On Friday, Gesell declared that ``the trial record presentlycontains no proof that defendant North ever received anyauthorization from President Reaan to engage in the illegal conductalleged, either directly or indirectly, orally or in writing.''   That represented a blow to North's strategy but is not expectedto deter his lawyers from focusing on Reagan.   They still may draw on secrets contained in a 44-page admissionby the government, outlining the administration's inducements toother countries in exchange for help to the Contras.   In addition, they are expected to zero in on exhibits alreadypresented at the trial suggesting authorization.   For example, after North denied in an Aug. 6, 1986, meeting withthe House Intelligence Committee that he was aiding the Contras,then-national security adviser John Poindexter wrote hissubordinate: ``Well done.'' North now is accused of obstructingCongress in connection with the meeting.   The defense subpoenaed Poindexter, a co-defendant in theIran-Contra case who will be tried separately from North later thisyear. Asserting his constitutional rights, Poindexter is decliningto appear.   In his absence, North's lawyers want to show several hours oftelevised testimony Poindexter gave on Capitol Hill in 1987 duringthe congressional Iran-Contra hearings.   Poindexter testified that his one regret was that he didn'tfollow up personally after North reported a threat on his life byterrorist Abu Nidal. Part of North's defense to the charge ofaccepting an illegal gratuity, a home security system, is that hefeared for his family's safety and that the government wouldn't payfor a security system.   The office of independent counsel Lawrence Walsh opposesintroducing the Poindexter videotape.   The problem with focusing on Reagan is that North's lawyers havebeen unable to place him at the scene of any of the alleged crimes.The closest brush to date involving the president came in thetestimony of former national security adviser Robert McFarlane.   McFarlane said he had talked with Reagan in the Oval Officeabout congressional inquiries before sending letters to Congress inSeptember 1985 which denied North was assisting the Contras.McFarlane later pleaded guilty to misdemeanors in connection withthe letters, which North is accused of preparing and for which heis now charged with felonies.   McFarlane testified that he got no guidance from Reagan on whatto say in the letters, but North's lawyers said they needed toquestion the president about the matter.   North's lawyers also tried to show a pattern of concealment fromCongress.   It was disclosed that Reagan, who told the Tower Commission in1987 he didn't know about National Security Council involvementwith the Contras, followed through on recommendations from the NSCstaff to help the rebels.   During a two-year congressional ban on Contra aid, Reagan signedoff on a secret plan to provide $110 million in extra aid to enticeHonduras to support the Contras.   In response to a memo from McFarlane, Reagan also telephoned thepresident of Honduras to get a military shipment destined for theContras released. It had been seized earlier in the day by theHonduran military.   Testimony at North's trial also shows that Reagan alsoapparently approved a secret airdrop of recoilless rifles and otheritems to the Contras. The rifles were to be used to destroy twoarms-bearing ships headed for Nicaragua.   McFarlane testified that when he told Reagan of a Saudi Arabiangovernment contribution to the Contras, ``he made clear to me thatno one should know and let's keep it that way.''</TEXT></DOC>
