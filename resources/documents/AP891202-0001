Tropical storm warnings for Cuba were lifted by the NationalHurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla.   The storm, moving in a clockwise loop, could make a completecircle in the Caribbean if it stays together long enough to meetwith a big funnel trough located in the Gulf of Mexico, forecasterBob Case said.   ``That could cause the storm to move to the northeast in a bigcircle,'' Case said.   But, there is a 50-50 chance the storm will dissipate beforethen, he said.   ``We don't see any major dramatic effect on land areas,'' hesaid.   The system surprised forecasters by achieving tropical stormstrength Thursday when its winds hit 39 mph.   Rainfall reports Thursday from Cuba included more than 14 inchesat Punta del Este on the Isle of Youth, more than seven inches inMatanzas and nearly five inches in Havana.   At 10:30 p.m. EST Friday, the center of the storm was locatednear latitude 17.8 north, longitude 85.2 west, or about 175 mileseast of Belize. Karen's highest sustained winds were near 40 mph.
