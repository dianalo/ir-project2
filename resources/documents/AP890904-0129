(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jurors head back to federal court Tuesdayto learn whether PTL founder Jim Bakker is competent to continue histrial for fraud and conspiracy.   The TV evangelist spent Labor Day confined for psychiatricexamination in the Federal Correctional Institute mental health unitin Butner, about 100 miles northeast of here, on the orders of U.S.District Judge Robert Potter.   ``It's still a little bit up in the air,'' Bakker's psychiatrist,Dr. Basil Jackson, said Monday in a telephone interview fromMilwaukee. ``I haven't been given the green light yet to go and seehim.''   Bakker, anxious and disheveled with chains on his hands and legs,was escorted by federal marshals to Butner after Jackson testifiedBakker was hallucinating and hiding his head under a couch in hisattorney's office.   Potter suspended Bakker's trial pending a determination ofwhether the TV evangelist is competent to stand trial. The jurorswere not told about Bakker's condition, but were told to check withthe court on Tuesday to see whether court proceedings would continueWednesday.   Jackson said he was told psychiatrists at Butner were speeding uptheir evaluation of Bakker's emotional state over the weekend.   ``If that's true, then it's conceivable one of their people couldcome back into court Tuesday or Wednesday to certify that he's(Bakker) ready to come back into trial,'' he said.   Attempts on Monday to reach administrators at Butner wereunsuccessful, and attorneys and others in the case are forbidden todiscuss it under a gag order issued by Potter.   Dr. Sally Johnson, chief of psychiatric services at Butner, hassaid evaluations of patients like Bakker typically last 30 days butcould take 45 days or more.   Jackson, who said he has not been allowed to talk with Bakkersince his arrival at Butner, said he has been in daily contact byphone with Bakker's wife, Tammy Faye Bakker, and Bakker's attorneysfor news on his condition.   Jackson also said he has heard Bakker has tried to contact himdaily.   ``I think that he has settled down and certainly has improved alot from the way he was Thursday morning,'' Jackson said.   ``I continue to be impressed with the emotional strength of thisman and his resilience.''   He said it was possible Bakker would be ready to return to courtthis week.   ``I'd like to see what condition he's in and have an opportunityto make a clinical judgment as to the likelihood of whether he mighthave a similar reaction to stress in the days ahead,'' Jackson said.   ``I'm interested not in his ability to be competent to withstandtrial on one day but competent for the entire trial,'' thepsychiatrist said.   Bakker is charged with 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy andfaces 120 years and prison and more than $5 million in fines.Prosecutors say Bakker used nearly $4 million in ministry funds tofinance a lavish lifestyle.</TEXT></DOC>
