The indictment accused Binyamin Shenkman, 35, of giving PLOofficials in Athens secret information on the Israeli army duringthree trips to Greece in 1988, the radio said.   He also offered to fly to PLO headquarters in Tunis and hold apress conference where he would answer questions on Israel'smilitary capabilities and publically tear up his Israeli passport,it said.   Shenkman demanded $1.5 million from the PLO in return for hisactions, the radio said. But he was never paid and police arrestedhim at the airport when he returned from Athens.   The radio said Shenkman moved to Israel from the Soviet Union in1978 and served in the army for four months in 1985.   Details of the information disclosed by Shenkman and his role inthe military have been banned from publication.   It is unusual, however, for a new immigrant who has served only ashort time in the military to be given a position in which he workswith sensitive information.   The radio had previously quoted Shenkman, whose name was firstreleased Sunday, as saying his actions were motivated in part by hisdisillusionment with Israel after immigrating.   ``I ask that you take into consideration that all my life I onlywanted to come to Israel, and here I suffered.'' the radio quotedShenkman as telling the court after he his arrest.   ``There were people who embittered my life every day and eachhour,'' he said. The radio did not elaborate.   The court has not yet set a date for Shenkman's trial.   A 1986 law bans unauthorized meetings with members of a terroristgroup. Israel views the PLO as a such a group.   Charges of espionage carry a maximun 30-year prison sentence.   Shenkman's is the second case of alleged espionage involving aSoviet emigre. On Dec. 15, Shabtai Kalmanovich, 45, was sentenced tonine years in prison on charges of spying for the Soviet Union andhaving contacts with a foreign agent.</TEXT></DOC>
