The St. Louis aircraft maker said it couldn't yet estimate the size of the charge.    McDonnell Douglas said it discovered cracks in the airframes of six of 150 Navy F-18s it has inspected so far, and it will begin a program of structurally modifying all F-18s early next year. So far, the stress problems haven't caused any accidents or performance problems with the plane, a McDonnell Douglas spokesman said. &quot;We are doing this well before we think there is any problem with the structural integrity of the aircraft,&quot; he said. &quot;Safety isn't an issue at this point.&quot;    The inspections began after the company's laboratory tests indicated stress problems could show up well before the planes reached their rated flight life of 6,000 hours. Some F-18s have already logged nearly 2,000 flight hours, the company said. &quot;Our inspections show we don't think the aft section is going to make it to the 6,000-hour mark, so we want to improve that section,&quot; the spokesman said.    McDonnell Douglas has been making F-18s since 1981 and to date has sold 594 of the aircraft. The company's spokesman said 419 of the planes are in the Navy and Marine Corps fleet, and another 116 are being flown by the Canadian air force. The aircraft also has been sold to Australia and Spain, he said.    The spokesman said McDonnell Douglas would probably take the charge for repairing the planes in 1988 but that it hadn't yet calculated the full cost of the repair program. An F-18 sells for about $18.5 million, and the company doesn't plan to change the price for its existing supply contracts, the spokesman said.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, McDonnell Douglas closed at $61.25 a share, down $1.    Over the past couple of years the Navy has had two problems with the F-18. It noticed that the tail wings seem to experience considerable stress that showed up in brackets on them that rotated. Also, the landing gears were subject to stress. At one time the Navy restricted the weight on F-18s to prevent damage to rods and other parts in the gears.    In 1984, McDonnell Douglas began reinforcing the F-18's structure to reduce stress on the plane's aft section.    The company said its latest laboratory tests showed cracks in the plane's aft airframe after 1,500 hours of simulated flight. The 150 Navy aircraft McDonnell Douglas inspectors recently looked at had more than 750 hours of flight time. The company's spokesman said the cracks didn't constitute a safety hazard, although he couldn't provide detail about the extent of the problems. All six planes are being repaired, he said.    He said that the company had concluded that under present conditions the planes &quot;probably wouldn't be flyable aircraft&quot; by the time they reached 6,000 flight hours.    McDonnell Douglas said the modifications to the aircraft will include a small metal flange that will be attached to the forward area of the fuselage. The flange will modify the flow of air before it reaches the vertical tail section, significantly reducing stress on the aircraft's aft section.    The company called the test results of its flange modification &quot;highly encouraging&quot; and said it should increase the F-18 aft section's service life &quot;substantially.&quot; The company spokesman said McDonnell Douglas is reaching for a full 6,000-hour service life for the planes when the modifications are complete.    Before any full-scale modification program is begun, McDonnell Douglas said it will first obtain Navy approval for the changes. &quot;We haven't determined what the process of modification will be,&quot; the company spokesman said, &quot;but it will be done in such a way as to minimize impact on fleet operations.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
