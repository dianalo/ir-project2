 On the other hand, mainframe terminal usersbelieve their lives will be unnecessarily complicated by network operations.andO;They are anxious about losing security.andM;&quot;Many users have grown to 'cherish' the Pc as their own device rather thanseeing it as a corporate tool,&quot; says Alex Perez, information centre analyst at South Bank in Miami.andP;  &quot;people think we're taking control of their machinewhen, in fact, we're giving them more freedom.&quot;andM;Perez approaches potential LAN users cautiously.andP;  &quot;We try to sell on thebenefits.andP;  Once we get one in the appreciation for what the network doesspreads.andP;  Department A sees that department B is on the LAN and the networkbegins to sell itself.&quot;andM;Despite end user apprehension, a well thought out and executed networkinstallation soon gives benefits.andP;  &quot;The key to a successful installation isthat the people network should drive the computer, rather than vice versa,&quot;says Jessica Lipnack, president of the Network Institute in Newton,Massachusetts.andM;Unfortunately, most computer manufacturers and many information systemsmanagers don't look at corporate networks this way.andP;  Instead, they focus ontechnology, giving little attention to business needs.andM;For example, while discussions of through-put and bandwidth are important,they're secondary.andP;  Perez suggests that network managers should begin theirplanning efforts by asking about the work that needs to be done, the locationof the business activity, reporting structures and who needs to talk to whom.andM;At the University of California at San Diego, network managers go through aseries of steps during network installations to ease the transition for theusers, says Steve Relyea, vice chancellor of business affairs.andP;  UCSD's 24campus and building networks connect more than 500 users.andM;One of the first steps was the standardization of applications software toeliminate the need for constant conversions between file formats.andO;Additionally, the use of a standardized frontend menu system designed tomaintain transparency between the user and the computer has had a majorimpact on the LAN appeal for the UCSD's users.andM;Groupware applications have been a controversial topic partly because of thedifficulty of execution.andP;  Few such programs exist, and one of the first,Action Technologies The Coordinator, caused a furore with its stringentrequirements for end user participation.andP;  The developer was forced tocompletely redesign the product to win user approval.andM;However, groupware can pay off, providing users with a reason to use andappreciate the network.andP;  At the Houston Chronicle users love their newintegrated software package from Uniplex Business Software, which runs ontheir Sun workstations and various X-Windows System terminals.andP;  The packagebuilds group schedules from personal calendars.andM;Other users aren't as happy with the initial software that they're using onnetworks.andP;  Southeast Bank ran into difficulty with its software,Ashton-Tate's dBase III.andP;  With a non-network program, users wereinadvertently corrupting data because the older program had no mechanism forrecord or file-locking - critical issues for multi-user applications.andM;Another tactic for enchancing the comfort level of end users is to sponsortraining classes, says Steve Stein, director of Strategies for Microcomputersand Office Systems, and end user service of the market research firmInternational Data in Framingham, Massachusetts.andP;  It's crucial to stress thebasics.andP;  &quot;I've never had a situation where users didn't want to work on a LANafter a training class,&quot; he added.andM;&quot;Support and training is the most important element in making networkadministration work,&quot; Stein says.andP;  &quot;The technology stuff - choosing the rightbox - is easy.andP;  Information centre managers have to listen to the usersbecause they're the ones who make the network a success.&quot;andM;The situation is changing, but many networks hav ebeen installed byindividual departments with little regard to corporate designs.andP;  Corporateinformation managers are trying to re-establish control over networking,centralizing the network under the central information systems manager.andM;Contrary to what many believe, networks can enhhance the security of userapplications and data.andP;  Not only can a network provide redundancy, it canhelp prevent intrusion.andP;  Diskless PCs supplemented by nightly backup ofnetwork files is another form of security.andM;No network installation is perfect.andP;  Users will always find something tocomplain about.andP;  But those who see the increase of productivity are undoubtlyhappier computer users.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
