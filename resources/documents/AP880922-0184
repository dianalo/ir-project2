They're offering more models than ever before, 40, that getcaught by the U.S. ``gas-guzzler'' excise tax, according to theannual fuel economy ratings released by the EnvironmentalProtection Agency on Thursday for 1989 models.   Five cars bearing U.S. names are also taxed. Two of them arelargely made in Europe and are aimed at the same hang-the-expensemarket segment that the Europeans are going after. The other threeare the only entirely U.S. models ever to pay the tax, which theyalso paid in 1987 but escaped last year.   As usual, the Japanese are the mileage champs. For the fourthstraight year the fuel-stingiest cars are the Japanese-made GeoMetro, formerly the Chevrolet Sprint, and the two-seater HondaCivic CRX HF.   The Metro's mileage was 53 miles per gallon in the city, 1 mpgbelow last year's figure for the same car, and 58 on the highwaytest, the same as last year. Geo is the new nameplate GeneralMotors Corp. is putting on the imports of its Chevrolet division.   The Civic's figures are identical to last year's: 50 mpg city,56 mpg highway.   The gas-guzzler tax, unique to the United States, assesses apenalty in the form of an excise that rises with declining fueleconomy. It starts at $500 and goes up to $3,850. It was enacted in1975, when fears of fuel shortages were rampant, and aimed atdiscouraging the unthrifty.   In all, 45 models _ some of them identical except for trim _ areofficial gas-guzzlers. Last year's list included only 24, and theyear before that the count was only 18.   This year's includes five Rolls-Royces that escaped in previousyears through a now-closed loophole that exempted cars of more than6,000 pounds gross vehicle weight.   European models that will pay the tax come from Rolls and itsBentley badge, plus Maserati, Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche,Aston-Martin, Jaguar, Volvo and BMW.   The proliferation of guzzlers reflects a growing desire forperformance and status, analysts say.   ``Around here it's almost a status symbol to have paid a $3,000penalty tax,'' commented Garrett Stasse, auto editor of TheRegister in Shrewsbury, N.J., in affluent Monmouth County.   ``If you have a car in your lineup that does not live up to itsperformance image, you're in more trouble today than if you have anofficial gas-guzzler,'' said Ed Miller, a senior editor at Ward'sAutomotive Publications in Detroit.   Clarence Ditlow, director of the Center for Auto Safety inWashington, an advocacy group that frequently has opposedrelaxation of government fuel standards, said: ``We are going inthe wrong direction. We ought to be headed the other way and makinggas-sippers.''   But manufacturers, he said, ``think they'll make more in profitsthan they pay in penalties.''   ``The tax really isn't objected to by the buyer'' of luxurycars, said Kyle Johnson of GM's Cadillac division. ``It does notalter GM's commitment to stay away from the gas-guzzler tax onU.S.-built cars.''   Johnson was commenting on the Cadillac Allante, a $50,000-plustwo-seater introduced last year to compete against the upscaleEuropeans. A larger engine this year brought it under the tax witha rating of 15 mpg in the city and 23 mpg on the highway, adding$650 to the sticker price.   The other taxed U.S. entry is one model of the Chrysler TC byMaserati, which had readings of 17 and 21. Other TC models escapethe tax, but not the one with the turbocharged 2.5-liter engine(152 cubic inches) without the top-gear lockup feature on thethree-speed automatic.   This car is built in Italy using many U.S.-supplied components.The Cadillac Allante is built in the United States using an Italianbody.   The other U.S. gas-guzzlers are the Chrysler Fifth Avenue andits identical twins, the Dodge Diplomat and the Plymouth GrandFury. They get 16 mpg in the city and 23 mpg out of town, accordingto EPA, compared with 17-23 last year and 16-21 in 1987.   Repeat tests of the same car can yield slightly differingresults. ``The car has not changed,'' said Tony Cervone, a Chryslerspokesman.   The Fifth Avenue family is in its last year. Successors wereintroduced last year: the Chrysler New Yorker and Dodge Dynasty,rated at 18 mpg city and 26 mpg highway for 1989.   In all, Japanese and Korean manufacturers captured the top 10spots, as they did last year. Because Japanese-owned plants in theUnited States and in Japan have in the past supplied the same carsto the U.S. market simultaneously, EPA no longer lists the topdomestic models. But the top U.S.-manufactured car from a Big Threecompany appears to be a Ford Escort recorded at 32-42.   The biggest guzzlers this year are four Aston-Martin sports carsnew to the United States, all 8-11 and carrying the top penalty of$3,850.</TEXT></DOC>
