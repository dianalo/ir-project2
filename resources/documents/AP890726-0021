SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   America's wives are bringing home a lot moreof the family bacon than they used to, but still trail theirhusbands by a wide margin, the Census Bureau reports.   Wives earned just 57 percent of what their husbands brought inas of 1987, although their income had increased nearly twice asfast as the men's during the decade.   Between 1981 and 1987, the average earnings of wives rose 23.3percent, while husbands' income climbed 11.8 percent, according tothe study, ``Earnings of Married-Couple Families: 1987.''   That brought average income of all wives _ including those notemployed outside the home _ to $13,245 in 1987, compared with$29,154 for all husbands.   A major reason for the gain by women was that ``more of them areworking year-round, full time, instead of part time,'' Censusstatistician Robert W. Cleveland said Tuesday. In past years, hesaid, women were more likely to accept part-time jobs, resulting inlower average income.   ``Also, more women are in professional and technical jobs whichtend to have better pay,'' Cleveland said, adding that one factorin the change is the tendency of women in recent years to pursuemore education.   ``I think there is more equal treatment, things are not asdiscriminatory for women. The opportunities are more available forthem now than in the past,'' Cleveland said.   Wives working full time at least 50 weeks per year averaged$18,929 in 1987, only 57 percent of the average $33,005 annualearnings of husbands who worked full time 50 weeks or more.   Recent government statistics for all men and women showed womenaveraging 65 percent of men's income, somewhat more than the 57percent for full-time working wives.   Wives are more likely to have to take time off to tend children,or to have delayed careers during child rearing, than women ingeneral.   Indeed, the effect of children may be noted in the incomes ofwives by age, as reported in the study.   The most rapid income rise between 1981 and 1987 was among wivesaged 35 to 44, who saw their average jump 31.5 percent, more thantriple the 9.8 percent increase for husbands in the same age group.   ``In that age bracket, the kids are grown, the women can enterthe labor force and ... start working full time,'' Cleveland said.   For all wives, those with no children averaged $14,256 in 1987compared with $13,067 for women with children aged 6 to 17; $12,163for those with children under age 6 and just $10,732 for those withchildren in both age groups.   Husbands averaged $31,636 for those with children aged 6 to 17;while those with some under 6 and some 6 to 17 averaged $29,564.For those with children under 6 average income was $28,181, and itwas $27,755 for husbands without children.   While husbands may bring home most of the bacon for a majorityof families, that isn't a universal situation.   About 5.3 million wives earned more than their husbands in 1987,about 18 percent of the 29.1 million married couples in which bothhusband and wife had earnings, the report said.   In many cases, husbands were 55 or older and often partlyretired, Cleveland said, while their wives tended to be slightlyyounger and still working full time. Wives who earned more thantheir husbands were more likely than other wives to have attendedcollege and to have no children at home, the report found.</TEXT></DOC>
