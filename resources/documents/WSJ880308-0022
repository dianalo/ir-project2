Analysts believe some U.S. companies will want to buy out minority interests in Canadian subsidiaries to facilitate corporate restructuring expected as a result of the trade agreement.    This view has helped fuel the recent rise in Toronto of such stocks as Celanese Canada, which has gained 15.5% the past six trading days. Other gainers include Union Carbide Canada, up 13.3% in the same period, Xerox Canada, up 12.1%, Budd Canada, up 4.4%, and Du Pont Canada, up 4.1%.    Two recent takeover announcements have sharpened investor interest in the equity of subsidiary companies. RJR Nabisco Inc. has offered to buy the 20% of the shares it didn't already own in its Canadian subsidiary, Nabisco Brands Ltd. And Britain's Imperial Chemical Industries PLC is considering a bid for the 28% of the shares it didn't already own of the Canadian chemical firm C-I-L.    Simon Gulden, a Nabisco Brands vice president, said that while free trade has become the market's &quot;current buzzword,&quot; it was just one of various factors that RJR Nabisco considered in deciding to buy out Nabisco Brands' Canadian shareholders. In the offering document, RJR Nabisco said increased integration of certain U.S. and Canadian operations is important &quot;to remain competitive on a world-wide basis.&quot;    Dismantling of U.S.-Canada trade barriers is to start Jan. 1, provided the pact, which has been signed by President Reagan and Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, is approved by the U.S. Congress and Canadian Parliament.    The agreement is expected to have a considerable effect on several industrial sectors in which U.S. investment in Canada has been heavy. These include petrochemicals, food processing and appliance manufacturing.    Ira Katzin, research director at Toronto-based Merit Investment Corp., said the buy-out of the Canadian shareholders in Canadian subsidiaries would give European and U.S. firms a freer hand to integrate their U.S. and Canadian operations.    He predicted Hoechst AG of West Germany may want its U.S. subsidiary, Hoechst Celanese Corp., to buy the 44% minority shareholding in Celanese Canada. The Canadian textile and chemical company is 56%-owned by Hoechst Celanese. In Summerville, N.J., a Hoechst Celanese spokesman declined to comment on the possibility of the company increasing its ownership of Celanese Canada.    John Pepperell, research director at Toronto-based McLeod Young Weir Ltd., said many Canadian subsidiaries of foreign-owned corporations were established as publicly traded vehicles in Canada to meet former Canadian government policy that required or encouraged participation by Canadians. &quot;This policy requirement has become substantially less exacting under the current federal Conservative government, and it will virtually disappear in most industries with the proposed U.S.Canada free trade agreement,&quot; he said.    Mr. Pepperell, in a research report, cited 36 major foreign-owned subsidiaries listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange and made buy recommendations for such issues as Scott Paper, a subsidiary of Scott Paper International Inc., British Columbia Telephone Co., a subsidiary of GTE Corp., and Camco Inc., a subsidiary of General Electric Co.    Appliance industry analysts have speculated that U.S. appliance companies may want to buy out the minority interests in Canadian subsidiaries to ease integration of their U.S. and Canadian operations.    The Canadian Appliance Manufacturers Association, which represents Canadian household appliance makers, predicted free trade will lead to &quot;a massive and costly restructuring&quot; of Canadian appliance plants because of lower U.S. production costs. This will result &quot;in fewer, larger and more specialized factories located close to the U.S. border, and consequent plant shutdowns in less economic regions,&quot; it said. All the major appliance companies in Canada are owned by U.S. companies.    Whirlpool last year increased its interest in the Canadian appliance maker Inglis to 72% from 50%, but a Whirlpool spokeswoman said she didn't know of any plan to take full ownership of the company. Inglis closed in Toronto yesterday at 18 Canadian dollars ($14.36), off 1.    Ray Kilroy, chemical industry analyst with Toronto-based Nesbitt Thomson Deacon Inc., said shares of some subsidiary companies can at times be difficult to trade because of the limited share float.    Rod White, a University of Western Ontario business administration professor, said he doesn't expect U.S.-Canadian free trade to result in a huge buy-out of minority shareholders by U.S. companies. Having a subsidiary quoted on a Canadian stock exchange, he said, has advantages, including better access to the Canadian capital market. </TEXT></DOC>
