(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Tracey A. Stewart will be missed when shegraduates from high school Sunday. After all, teachers and studentsin Raleigh County have seen her in class every day for the past 13years.   ``Some times when I think about it, I think I must have beencrazy,'' said Ms. Stewart, a senior at Liberty Raleigh High School.``I can't believe I did all this for a certificate.''   Ms. Stewart said she has no secret formula for perfect attendance.   ``I don't think it's a big deal,'' she said. ``My parents go towork, so I would rather go to school than be at home by myself.''But she also said she'd probably not keep up the perfect record ifshe had it to do over again.   Ann Stewart, Tracey's mother, said she remembers plenty of timeswhen her daughter dragged herself from a sickbed to attend classes.   ``There were times when I tried to get her to stay home fromschool, but she wouldn't do it,'' Mrs. Stewart said.   Ms. Stewart said the closest she came to staying home was duringher sophomore year, when she was depressed about her brother and hisfriends having graduated the year before.   ``But I got over it,'' she said.   Ms. Stewart had a lot of incentives besides classwork to make herget out of bed every day. She participated in basketball, volleyballand several clubs and held a job.   Now, she's ready to move on to Beckley College and, eventually,West Virginia University.   ``I'm just like every senior. I'm just ready to graduate,'' saidMs. Stewart.</TEXT></DOC>
