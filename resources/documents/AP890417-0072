Meanwhile, guerrilla reports in Pakistan claimed the insurgentshad breached the southern defenses of the eastern Afghan city ofJalalabad after a six-week siege.   However, diplomats in Kabul, the Afghan capital, said thegovernment may have succeeded in reopening the highway from thecapital to Jalalabad. The U.S.-backed guerrillas had destroyed abridge to close the road during their offensive.   In the Kabul trial, the Special Court for National Security saidthe defendant, Abdul Razaq, deserved the death penalty. However,the court said it commuted his sentence to 16 years in prisonbecause he asked for mercy. The court said he could appeal.   The three-judge panel found the man guilty of illegally enteringAfghanistan, military spying, collaborating with insurgents, andtrying to persuade government soldiers to defect to neighboringPakistan.   Razaq admitted entering Afghanistan illegally, but he said hecame only to preach Islam.   ``I am not a professional killer,'' he told the court. ``I cameto make peace between two (guerrilla) commanders. I am not a spy.My objective was to remove tension between two disputing sides.''   He was arrested last December by government troops who stormed aguerrilla hideout in northwestern Afghanistan, prosecutors said.   He said his home was a Palestinian refugee camp in Jordan.   On April 5, the court convicted two Pakistanis of spying fortheir government. One was sentenced to 16 years in prison, theother to 18 years.   The most powerful anti-government forces are based in Pakistan,which supports their fight.   The Afghan News Agency, mouthpiece of the seven-party guerrillaalliance based in Pakistan, today quoted a guerrilla commanderidentified as Fazli Haq Muhajid as saying the insurgents had brokenJalalabad's stiff southern defenses.   Al-Bunyan News Service, linked to the guerrillas' fundamentalistIttehad-i-Islami Party, said battles raged around the headquartersof the Afghan Army's 81st Brigade south of the city.   However, there were no immediate reports of casualties and noindependent confirmation.   The diplomats in Kabul, speaking on condition of anonymity, gaveno details in reporting the highway from Kabul to Jalalabad may beopen again. However, they said a convoy of about 65 trucks withweapons and ammunition left today for Jalalabad.   The city, where an estimated 100,000 people now live, was theguerrillas' first major objective since Soviet troops withdrew fromAfghanistan two months ago. They had intervened nine years beforein support of Marxist rulers.   The city's capture would be a major morale boost for theguerrillas, who earlier predicted that the country's governmentwould quickly collapse without the Red Army's help.   In other fighting today, government troops battled for the fifthday to dislodge guerrillas who had cut the Salang highway runningnorth from Kabul to the Soviet Union. The blockade has preventedhundreds of trucks carrying food and fuel from reaching the capital.   The guerrilla reports also said there was heavy fighting nearKhost, another eastern garrison town about 78 miles south ofJalalabad. They claimed guerrillas killed or wounded 350 governmenttroops and captured five tanks, two armored personnel carriers, andsome heavy weapons over the weekend.   Those reports were also impossible to confirm.</TEXT></DOC>
