(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Wildlife officials say they are stumped bythe discovery of three more dead eagles along the Piney River,bringing to 10 the number of eagles found dead in the area recently.   About 30 eagles are killed each year in Colorado. Most are hitby cars while as they feed on dead animals in the road, or areelectrocuted when they land on power lines, said Todd Malmsbury,spokesman for the state Division of Wildlife.   But in this case, he said, ``We're looking at somethingcompletely different.''   The state and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service are conductingtests to find out what might have killed the birds.   Traces of mercury in their systems would not necessarily causethe birds to die, and officials have been unable to find a sourceof mercury in the area.   The birds are protected by several state and federal laws,including the Endangered Species Act.</TEXT></DOC>
