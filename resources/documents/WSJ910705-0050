Michael Lloyd, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc.,estimated that earnings for the group were down 15% to 20% inthe quarter from a year earlier. &quot;Rail carloadings continueto remain weak,&quot; he said. Nevertheless, some analysts saythat aggressive cost-reduction moves helped most of the railgroup weather the drop in traffic with surprisingly littleharm.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Earnings are down in most cases, but not significantly,&quot;said Burton Strauss Jr., an analyst at Shearson LehmanBrothers Inc. &quot;The rails have done quite well within theframework of a poor economy.&quot;   Consolidated Rail Corp., usually considered among the mostcyclical of railroads, demonstrated unexpected resilience,reflecting the company's decision to cut costs early in therecession. Some analysts expect Conrail to match or slightlysurpass its fully diluted earnings of $1.28 a share, beforenonrecurring gains, in the year-earlier second quarter.   On the other hand, Burlington Northern Inc.'s performanceprobably will be the most disappointing; last month, thecompany said it couldn't rule out break-even second-quarterresults, excluding a $435 million special charge taken duringthe latest period. Analysts also expect lower earnings atNorfolk Southern Corp. and Union Pacific Corp.   Overall, rail carloadings fell 7.2% in the 12 weeks endedJune 22, according to the Association of American Railroads.The recession depressed shipments of industrial goods rangingfrom motor vehicles, which declined 14%, to lumber, whichfell 10.7%. Shipments of grain were off 14.6%, largelybecause of weak export demand. Even coal traffic was down5.6%, reflecting unusually warm spring weather that cutdemand for utility power. And some shippers diverted freightto trucks in April during a one-day nationwide rail strike.   Analysts said that among major railroads, only the railunits of Union Pacific and Santa Fe Pacific Corp. postedcarloading gains during the second quarter. They expect SantaFe to report second-quarter earnings of about 10 cents ashare, compared with a year-earlier loss of one cent a share.   However, analysts said their projections of modestly lowersecond-quarter earnings at Union Pacific were based on lowernatural gas prices at the company's resources unit andtraffic declines at its trucking unit. In the 1990 secondquarter Union Pacific reported net income of $153 million, or$1.53 a share.   A Norfolk Southern spokesman declined to comment onanalysts' estimates that the company would post lowersecond-quarter earnings, compared with net of $155.9 million,or 95 cents a share, in the year-ago period. The spokesmansaid the rail's export coal shipments improved in the quarterbut not enough to offset lower carloadings of domesticutility coal.   Analysts expect modestly lower earnings at CSX Corp.,excluding a one-time gain of $96.7 million taken in thelatest quarter from sale of a one-third interest in its HongKong shipping terminal. In the 1990 second quarter, CSX hadnet of $109 million, or $1.08 a share. CSX's main unitsshowed mixed results in the latest quarter, with higheroperating earnings at the company's ocean shipping company,Sea-Land Service, while its inland barge unit was hurt byweak export grain traffic. Efforts at its rail unit toimprove productivity and reduce accidents helped to cushion a10% to 11% drop in carloadings.   Conrail officials declined to comment on analysts'estimates. But they acknowledged that the company'sdemonstrated ability to slash costs will put to rest anydoubts that Conrail can weather a recession. &quot;There was someconcern on Wall Street and even among customers that Conrailcould make its costs variable enough to survive a downturn,&quot;said James Hagen, Conrail's chairman, president and chiefexecutive officer. &quot;We got hit hard by the recession, but ithas gone well,&quot; he said. &quot;We demonstrated that we can controlour costs in a downturn and keep service levels up and ourtrack in good shape.&quot; However, Mr. Hagen said he doesn'texpect a significant improvement in business conditions untillate in the year.   &quot;Conrail has written the book on costcutting in arecession,&quot; said Joel Price, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkinandamp; Jenrette Securities Corp.   But Mr. Price said he is &quot;extremely disappointed&quot; by thelikelihood that Burlington Northern will post very low orzero earnings in the second quarter, excluding the $435million after-tax write-off for personal injuries andemployee reductions. In the 1990 second quarter, BurlingtonNorthern earned 92 cents a share.   &quot;The railroad that is presumed to have the greatest degreeof recession resistance because of its reliance on coal andgrain is performing the worst,&quot; Mr. Price said. &quot;Whathappened to Burlington Northern reflects a deterioration ofits coal yields and a cost structure that clearly has beenout of control relative to other railroads.&quot;   A Burlington Northern spokesman said the company was hurtby lower coal shipments in the quarter, though the biggestproblem was lack of foreign demand for grain. However, hesaid freight &quot;traffic has firmed up&quot; in recent weeks, and thecompany's prediction of break-even second-quarter results &quot;isprobably the worst case.&quot; He added that the full benefit ofBurlington Northern's recent cost-control measures will berealized in the second half of 1991.</TEXT></DOC>
