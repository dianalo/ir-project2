It is the only subspeciesof this group whose range once included both the North American and Asiancontinents (Amaral 1985). The Aleutian Canada goose is now known to nestonly on remote islands of the Alaska Peninsula and Aleutian Island chain,Alaska. It can be distinguished from most other Canada geese by its smallsize (only cackling Canada geese, <T3>B. c. minima,</T3> are smaller) and by a ring of white feathers atthe base of the neck in birds older than 6 to 8 months. Most Aleutian Canadageese migrate from their Alaska breeding grounds in September, sometimesstopping along the Oregon coast en route to the wintering grounds in California,where they begin arriving mid-October. One distinct subpopulation wintersin coastal Oregon near Pacific City. Aleutian geese depart the winteringareas in April and return to Alaska to nest and rear young during May throughSeptember.The Aleutian Canada goose was added to the U.S. Department of the Interior'slist of endangered species on March 11, 1967 (32 FR 4001), and to the listof foreign endangered species (Japan) on June 2, 1970 (35 FR 8495). Thedecline in numbers of Aleutian Canada geese and the reduction of theirbreeding range is largely attributed to predation by arctic fox, whichwere introduced on many Aleutian islands during the period starting 1836to about 1930. Before their wintering grounds were identified in 1975,Aleutian geese were also among waterfowl hunted recreationally and forfood in the Pacific Flyway, particularly California.At the time of listing, a reliable estimate of the total number of AleutianCanada geese was not available. However, Kenyon (1963), speculated thatonly 200-300 individuals of this species remained. Nesting was believedto be restricted to a single island in the western Aleutian archipelago,Buldir, and the migratory route and wintering habits of this species wereunknown. Introduced arctic fox persist on most islands throughout the Aleutianchain_islands that formerly provided nesting habitat to the once numerousAleutian Canada goose. Surveys in the Aleutian Islands in the late 1930'sindicated that geese were rare or extirpated in locations where foxes hadbeen introduced (Murie 1959).Even prior to listing, efforts were undertaken to eliminate introducedfox populations from Aleutian Islands formerly occupied by nesting geese.By 1965, arctic fox had been eradicated from Amchitka Island and by thelate 1970's, Alaid, Nizki, and Agattu Islands were also fox free. Morerecently, Amukta and Rat Islands have been cleared of introduced foxes.All fox have also apparently been eliminated from Kiska, but additionalsurveys are needed to verify the island is fox free.While fox control efforts in Alaska were making former breeding habitatonce again suitable for nesting geese, hunting closures in key Californiaand Oregon wintering habitat have been primarily responsible in allowingthe wild population to increase from 790 birds in 1975 to about 5,800 birdsin fall 1988. Annual increases in numbers of Aleutian Canada geese on theCalifornia wintering grounds have averaged 16 per cent (McNab and Springer1988; Springer and Gregg 1988) during this 14-year period (Table 1). Therehas been an increase every year since accurate counts started in the springof 1975, although the increase in 1985-86 was only 2%.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table</T4> 1._<T4>Peak Number of Aleutian Canada Geese Wintering in California,</T4>1975-1988.<H1>Year</H1><H1>Peak count</H1><H1>Increase (%)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">1975 (spring<D>790</D><D>_</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1975-76<D>900</D><D>15</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1976-77<D>1,200</D><D>33</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1977-78<D>1,500</D><D>25</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1978-79<D>1,590</D><D>6</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1979-80<D>1,740</D><D>9</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1980-81<D>2,000+</D><D>15</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1981-82<D>2,700</D><D>35</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1982-83<D>3,500</D><D>30</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1983-84<D>3,800</D><D>9</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1984-85<D>4,200</D><D>11</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1985-86<D>4,300</D><D>2</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1986-87<D>4,800+</D><D>12</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1987-88<D>5,400</D><D>12</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1988-89<D>5,800</D><D>7</D></ITAG></ITAG>The Aleutian Canada Goose Recovery Plan, dated 1977 and revised in 1982,includes the following criteria for reclassification and delisting, respectively:<ITAG tagnum="21">After self-sustaining populations of 50 or more breeding pairs havebeen reestablished on each of 2 areas or a total of 100 or more pairs havebeen reestablished on 3 acres (with 10 pairs the minimum colony size),recommendations for reclassifying the Aleutian Canada goose to threatenedstatus will be sent to the Director, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. When50 or more breeding pairs are reestablished on each of 3 areas, recommendationsfor removal from the list of threatened and endangered species will besent to the Director.</ITAG>These criteria are conditional on the wild population maintaining a levelof 1,200 birds or greater and the ``reestablished populations'' being consideredadditional to and not inclusive of the Buldir Island nesting colony.Based on the best current estimates available, the Service believes thatthe primary breeding population on Buldir numbers 1,100-1,500 pairs; 20-22pairs nest on Kiliktagik Island in the Semidi Islands; and 35-40 pairsnest on Agattu, Nizki and Alaid Islands, which are all in the Near Islandgroup. The Service is less confident of the number of pairs breeding onChagulak Island in the Islands of Four Mountains. However, based on surveysin 1982 and 1984, the total population is estimated at 250-300 birds (Deinesand Hatch 1984), with 50 pairs breeding there currently (Bailey and Trapp1984). A single breeding pair was also discovered on nearby Amukta Islandin 1989.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Factors Affecting the Species</ITAG>The Service proposes to reclassify the Aleutian Canada goose (<T3>Branta canadensis leucopareia</T3>) from endangered to threatened.The Service's listing regulations (50 CFR part 424) provide for a reviewof five factors when reclassifying (or listing or delisting) a species(andSection;424.11). The Service has studied the relevant information availablefor the Aleutian Canada goose in North America and summarizes this informationfor each of these five factors below:1. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or Curtailmentof its Habitat or Range. Historically, Aleutian Canada geese are known to have bred on most of thelarger Aleutian Islands as well as the Commander and northern Kuril Islands(U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1982). At the time of listing, the knownbreeding range for the species was restricted to 4,914-acre (1,990-hectare)Buldir Island, which because of its ruggedness and small size was sparedthe introduction of foxes. The wintering range was thought to have includedJapan and from British Columbia to California in North America (Delacour1954). The precise wintering area(s) of the remnant population breedingat Buldir Island was unknown.While private inholdings, military activity and the introduction of mammals(e.g., fox, cattle, voles, and ground squirrels) have disturbed some islands,most of the historical breeding range of the Aleutian Canada goose andthe islands where Aleutian geese are currently known to nest are uninhabitedand relatively undisturbed. Current nesting islands include Buldir, Agattu,Nizki, Chagulak and Kiliktagik. Single nesting pairs were also discoveredon Alaid and Amukta Islands in 1989. All nesting locations are within theAlaska Maritime Natural Refugee.The wintering range for this species has been the focus of study from 1974to the present. Areas in California and Oregon essential to the wintersurvival of this species have been identified and partially protected.Major accomplishments in this respect include additions to the NationalWildlife Refuge system in western Oregon, acquisition of Castle Rock andits inclusion in the National Wildlife Refuge system, habitat acquisitionand protective easements in the San Joaquin and Sacramento Valleys, andrecent approval for habitat acquisition for the new San Joaquin River NationalWildlife Refuge. Other areas important to the wintering flock in Del NorteCounty have been acquired by the State of California and are part of theDepartment of Fish and Game's Wildlife Area and State Park systems. Notwithstanding,perhaps the greatest remaining threat to the future well-being of thisspecies is the availability of sufficient wintering habitat. Some privatelyowned agricultural areas currently utilized by the wintering flock arebeing converted from row crops or pasture to other crops of little or nofood value to geese or lost competively to commercial development. 2. Utilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific, or EducationalPurposes Historically, this species was harvested for subsistence purposes by aleuts,a native people indigenous to the Aleutian Islands eastward to Kodiak Island.Aleutian geese were also taken by market hunters in their wintering grounds.In the recent past, Aleutian Canada geese were among other waterfowl huntedrecreationally and for food within the Pacific Flyway, paticularly California.Although it is generally recognized that the severe numerical decline ofthe species is attributable to predation on the nesting islands by introducedarctic fox, hunting in migration and wintering areas was signficiant inthat it was the likely factor preventing remnant breeding populations suchas those on Buldir and Chagulak Islands, from recovering. Management ofthe Canada goose harvest in California was complicated by three factors:(1) Specific areas important to <T3>leucopareia </T3>had not yet been identified; (2) may subspecies ofCanada geese intermix in California during winter; and (3) most hunterscannot readily differentiate the various subspecies.Since 1973, the area of Unimak Pass, Alaska, has been closed to the huntingof Canada geese. In the wintering grounds the distribution and movementsof Aleutian Canada geese were determined by sightings and band returnsof individuals that were color marked by their Buldir Island nesting groundsand at the spring staging areas near Crecent City, California. A comprehensiveeffort ensued to protect the wintering flock from hunting and to secureroosting and feeding habitat. Three areas in California_Del Norte and HumboldtCounties, areas near Colusa, and localities near Modesto and Los Banos_havebeen closed to Canada goose hunting since 1975. In Oregon, portions ofCoos, Curry and Tillamook Counties have similarly been closed since 1982.More recently, Aleutian Canada geese in Washington, Oregon, and Californiahave also benefited indirectly, from hunting closures designated to protectwintering dusky Canada geese (<T3>B. c. occidentalis</T3>) and cackling Canada geese.Cooperation and support among all levels of government (federal, state,county, and municipal) and hunger and waterfowl interest groups have madethe effort to protect the geese on the wintering grounds possible. Theeffectiveness and success of the hunting closures are clearly demonstratedin two ways: (1) Available data indicate that annual mortality to illegalhunting is usually far less than one percent of the total population; and(2) the wild population has increased from 790 birds in 1975, when theclosures in California were implemented, to almost 6,000 birds in 1988(McNab and Springer 1988). It is anticipated that key migration and winteringareas in Alaska, Oregon, and California will continue to be closed to AleutianCanada goose hunting until this species has fully recovered and is delisted.3. Disease or PredationPredation by introduced artic fox in the Aleutian Island nesting groundshad a severe impact on this species. In the period from 1949 to the present,Service efforts have resulted in the removal of introduced arctic fox fromAmchitka (73,024 acres; 29,552 hectares), Agattu (55,535 acres; 22,475hectares), Alaid and Nizki (3,175 acres; 1,285 hectares), Rat (6,861 acres;2,777 hectares), and Amukta (12,425 acres; 5,028 hectares) Islands. Foxremoval efforts have also apparently succeeded on Kiska Island (69,598acres; 28,166 hectares), although additional surveys are needed for verification.Together with the several small islands that either escaped fox introductionsor where fox populations have died out, more than 244,000 acres (98,785hectares) are currently fox free in the Aleutians. However, this representsless than 15 percent of the habitat that was available to nesting geeseprior to the era of fox introductions.Concurrent with the fox removal program, an effort was conducted to reintroduceAleutian geese to these former nesting islands where foxes were eliminated.Initial reintroductions were of captive raised geese. In 1979, wild familygroups of geese were transplanted to release islands from the nesting populationat Buldir. In 1984, the Service confirmed that a small population of nestinggeese had been reestablished on Agattu Island. This marked the first nestingof wild Aleutian Canada geese on Agattu since the 1930's. Service effortshave also resulted in the return of Aleutian geese to Nizki and Alaid Islandswhere a small breeding population was confirmed in 1988. Although morethan 450 Aleutian geese have been released on Amchitka and 116 geese wererecently released on Little Kiska, nesting on these islands has not yetbeen confirmed.The Service intends to continue the fox eradication effort on additionalislands. Rats, which have been introduced to Amchitka, Kiska and Rat Islands,are a potential predator on goslings and eggs. No other mammalian predatorsoccur in the breeding grounds and losses to avian predators (bald eagles,common ravens, parasitic jeagers, glaucous-winged gulls, and peregrinefalcons) are not known to pose a significant threat except in the Rat Islandgroup (Amchitka, Kiska, and Little Kiska) where the bald eagle predationis a problem following the release of either captive raised or transplantedgeese. Although coyotes, peregrine, and prairie falcons may occasionallyprey on Aleutian Canada geese wintering in California, predation thereis not a significant mortality factor.Low level bacterial and parasitic infestations have been detected amonggeese on Buldir Island, but in the breeding range, losses to these or otherdiseases are not known to have ever been significant. In California however,the wintering flock is often concentrated in areas of available food, water,or roosting sites and considerable mortality to disease has occurred. In1987, approximately 50 Aleutian Canada geese succumbed during an outbreakof avian cholera that killed several hundred waterfowl in the Modesto area.Cholera is a chronic problem in the San Joaquin Valley and, while the geesecan be hazed from locations where cholera is prevalent, few safe alternativeroosting areas are currently available.The threat of large losses to disease will increase as the population growsin number but remains concentrated. A Disease and Contamination HazardContingency Plan has been prepared by the Aleutian Canada Goose RecoveryTeam. The purpose of the plan is to minimize losses of geese through establishinga protocol to respond to disease or contaminant occurrences.4. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory MechanismThis species is protected by the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended;the Migratory Bird Treaty Act; and the Convention on International Tradein Endangered Species as an appendix I species. Captive rasied <T3>B. c. leucopareia</T3> are treated as if listed in appendix II. Itis also currently designated as endangered by the Alaska Department ofFish and Game and recognized as endangered by the State of California,the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, and the Washington Departmentof Wildlife. If the proposed reclassification to threatened status becomesfinal, no substantive change in the protection afforded this species underthese regulatory mechanisms is anticipated. Existing regulatory mechanismsdetermined necessary to protect this species and its essential habitatwill remain in effect.5. Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting its Continued ExistenceIn 1982, the discovery of a remnant breeding population of Aleutian Canadageese on 2,082-acre (842-hectare) Chagulak Island (Bailey and Trapp 1984),which also apparently escaped the introduction of foxes, greatly benefitedthe recovery program. Another apparent remnant breeding population wasdiscovered on Kiliktagik Island (230 acres, 93 hectares) south of the AlaskaPeninsula in 1979 (Hatch and Hatch 1983). This location is east of whatwas previously considered the historical breeding range for the species(U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1982). Physical measurements of the birdsindicated that the geese on Kiliktagik were intermediate between AleutianCanada geese and a slightly larger mainland occurring subspecies, <T3>B. c. taverneri</T3> (Johnson <T3>et al.</T3> 1979). Shields and Wilson (1987) examined samples of mitochondrialDNA from these and other geese <T3>(leucopareia</T3>) from Buldir and Chagulak, and two mainland occurringsubspecies, <T3>taverneri</T3> and <T3>minima</T3>. Their study demonstrated that subspecies of Canada geesehave distinct mitochondrial DNA by which they can be identified. Shieldsand Wilson concluded that the Kiliktagik Island geese showed a clear affinityto <T3>leucopareia</T3> from Buldir and Chagulak and were, in fact, separablefrom both <T3>taverneri</T3> and <T3>minima</T3>. This information, together with morphological and behavioralsimilarities, and historical accounts which indicate geese were presentin the Semidi Island group as early as 1970, support the conclusion thatthe geese on Kiliktagik are a relict population from what probably wasonce a continuous island occurring form that extended from the westernGulf of Alaska and Alaska Peninsula region to the Commander and Kuril Islandsof the Soviet Union (Hatch and Hatch 1983).Aleutian geese using coastal areas traditionally roost on off-shore islandsas Castle Rock near Crescent City, California and on rocky islands suchas Chief Kiwanda Rock near Pacific City, Oregon. The use of these sitesexposes the geese to storm systems that sometimes drive the birds intothe sea. Storm-related drowning accounted for the mortality of 43 AleutianCanada geese near Crescent City in 1984, and 23 Aleutian geese near PacificCity in 1987 (Springer <T3>et al. </T3>in preparation; Lowe 1987). Although these occurrencesare isolated events, Aleutian geese traditionally spend a large part oftheir annual life cycle in proximity to the marine environment, includinga twice annual trans-oceanic migration, and drowning may be an importantnatural mortality factor. A small number of Aleutian geese have also diedas a result of collisions with man-made structures such as powerlines andfrom lead poisoning from the ingestion of spent lead shot. Man-made structuresdo not currently pose a significant collision hazard for the species, andmortality from lead poisoning in the future should be negligible as theuse of lead shot is phased out. Endangered species that are reduced to very small numerical levels maysustain the added threat of reduced genetic fitness. In effect, they maylack resiliency or the ability to adapt to environmental changes or eventsthat may jeopardize their existence (Brussard 1986). Early population estimatessuggest that Aleutian Canada geese numbered from 200-800 at their lowestpopulation level and relict populations persisted on three widely separatedislands. Therefore, it is unlikely that the present population is sufferingdeleterious effects from lost genetic fitness. <ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Status</ITAG>This species has been the focus of a 20-year comprehensive recovery programsince listing, and has benefited from many management and research accomplishmentsin both the breeding and wintering grounds. The wild population has increasedan average of 16 percent annually since 1975 and now exceeds 5,000 birds.As population growth continued an upward trend, the known breeding rangehas also expanded. In addition to Buldir Island, Aleutian geese are nowalso known to breed on Chagulak and Kiliktagik Islands (remnant populationsdiscovered since listing) and the Near Islands (Agattu, Alaid and Nizki).A single pair of nesting geese was also discovered on Amukta Island in1989.A method for reestablishing breeding populations extirpated by introducedfoxes was developed on Agattu Island and is currently being used in theeffort to return geese to Amchitka and Little Kiska Islands. The Servicealso plans to reintroduce geese to Kiska Island in the near future. Allcurrent nesting islands and most of the historic breeding habitat for thisspecies in North America is within the Alaska Maritime National WildlifeRefuge. Although arctic fox have been eradicated on six Aleutian islands, fox populationspersist on many other islands that formerly supported nesting geese. TheService's logistical ability to carry out recovery programs including foxremoval and reestablishing geese on fox free islands has been greatly enhancedby the acquisition of the research vessel, <T3>Tiglax. </T3>In California and Oregon, efforts to acquire or protect key wintering habitathave been partially successful. Several important areas, including CastleRock, have been acquired and are now part of the National Wildlife Refugesystem. Other important wintering areas are not currently protected andare threatened with conversion from pasture or agricultural lands to otheruses such as housing, highway, and commercial development. Recent authorizationfor a 10,300 acre (4,170 hectare) addition to the National Wildlife Refugesystem west of Modesto may alleviate some of the threats to the winteringpopulation in this region (Helvie 1987). Chronic outbreaks of avian cholera and botulism pose additional threatsto wintering waterfowl populations. Cumulatively, fewer than 100 Aleutiangeese are known to have succumbed to disease since 1975. Although documentedmortality to date has been low, the potential exists for catastrophic lossesto occur. Hence, geese are routinely hazed from areas where cholera isprevelant which forces them to use less preferred roosting sites, travelgreater distances to feeding areas and increases the potential for mortalityfrom illegal hunting. The recent development of a Disease and ContaminantHazard Contingency Plan (Wilbur <T3>et al. </T3>1987) will quicken agency response and minimize lossesto these potential threats. The Service's Madison National Wildlife HealthResearch Center has also developed a vaccine effective in immunizing Canadageese from avian cholera. Although no wild Aleutian Canada geese have beeninnoculated, the capability exists. The methodology for raising this birdin captivity is also well established. More than 140 <T3>leucopareia</T3> are currently being held by zoos and waterfowl propagatorsin the United States and Canada. This captive flock ensures a separateand secure gene pool should the wild population suffer severe losses fromdisease or natural calamity. The definitions of endangered, species, and threatened at andSection; 424.02of this title are as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">(e) ``Endangered species'' means a species that is in danger of extinctionthroughout all or a significant portion of its range.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(k) ``Species'' includes any species or subspecies of fish, wildlife,or plant, and any distinct population segment of any vertebrate speciesthat interbreeds when mature * * *.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(m) ``Threatened species'' means any species that is likely to becomean endangered species within the foreseeable future throughout all or asignificant portion of its range.</ITAG>Population increases, current nesting on seven fox free Aleutian islands,and protection of the wintering flock through hunting closures and habitatacquisition have significantly reduced the degree of threat to this species.The Service is most encouraged by the existence of additional breedingpopulations but acknowledges that current biogeographical and extinctiontheory strongly suggest that small, isolated populations are very vulnerableto extirpation from random environmental events or other factors. In reviewingthe progress toward recovery that this species has made since listing,the Service concludes that the Aleutian Canada goose is no longer in dangerof extinction. However, due to the small size of reestablished breedingpopulations, the continued presence of introduced arctic fox on many formernesting islands, and threats to the species on the wintering grounds fromhabitat alteration and disease, the Service finds that delisting is premature.Based on a careful assessment of the best scientific and commercial informationavailable regarding past, present and future threats faced by this species,the preferred action is therefore, to reclassify the Aleutian Canada goosefrom endangered to threatened. The Service will recommend that this speciesbe delisted when recovery criteria as outlined in the recovery plan arereached (see <T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION, </T2>Background section).<ITAG tagnum="84">Effects of Rule</ITAG>If made final, this rule would change the status of the Aleutian Canadagoose at 50 CFR 17.11 from endangered to threatened. These rules wouldacknowledge the population of Canada geese breeding on Kiliktagik Islandin the Semidi Islands and wintering in Tillamook County, Oregon as being<T3>Branta canadensis leucopareia.</T3> Furthermore, these rules wouldformally recognize the relative security of this species from no longerbeing in imminent danger of extinction throughout a significant portionof its range. This proposed change in classification does not significantlyalter the protection fo this species under the Endangered Species Act.Anyone taking, attempting to take, or othewise possessing an Aleutian Canadagoose in an illegal manner would still be subject to penalty under section11 of the Act. There would be no difference in penalties for the illegaltake of an endangered species versus a threatened species. Section 7 ofthe Act would also continue to protect this species from federal actionsthat would jeopardize the continued existence of the species. <ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comments Solicited </ITAG>The Service intends that any final action resulting from this proposalwill be accurate and as effective as possible. Therefore, any commentsor suggestions from the public, other concerned governmental agencies,the scientific community, industry, or any other interested party concernigany aspect of this proposal are hereby solicited. Comments particularlyare sought concerning: (1) Biological or other relevant data concerning any threat (or lack thereof)to Aleutian Canada geese;(2) The location of any additional populations of this species; (3) Additional information concerning the range and distribution of thisspecies; and(4) Current or planned activities in the subject area and their possibleimpacts on this species.Final promulgation of the regulation on <T3>Branta canadensis leucopareia</T3> will take into consideration thecomments and any additional information received by the Service, and suchcommunications may lead to adoption of a final regulation that differsfrom this proposal.The Endangered Species Act provides for a public hearing on this proposal,if requested.
