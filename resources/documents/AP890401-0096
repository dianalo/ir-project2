Gorbachev arrives inHavana Sunday for talks that focus attention on the contrastbetween President Fidel Castro's doctrinaire Marxism and thepragamatic reforms of his communist sponsor.   It will be the Soviet leader's first visit to a Latin Americancountry and only his third meeting with Castro, who traveled toMoscow for the 27th Communist Party Congress after Gorbachev tookpower and participated in the November 1987 Kremlin ceremoniesmarking the 70th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution.   In addition to the formal talks beginning Monday, Gorbachev willparticipate in ceremonial wreath layings and visit a health clinic,a genetic engineering center, and a crew of people who buildhousing on a voluntary basis.   He is expected to address the National Assembly in a nationallybroadcast speech Tuesday and leaves the next day for London andmeetings with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Queen ElizabethII.   Gorbachev will be accompanied by his wife Raisa.   Both nations have stressed in recent public statements thefriendly nature of the visit and the healthy relations between thetwo communist countries.   But Castro in the past has been openly critical of``perestroika,'' Gorbachev's ambitious modernization program, forborrowing free-market concepts from capitalism. There areindications the Soviets have substantially reduced their aid to theisland nation 90 miles off the Florida coast.   The Soviets highlighted another difference in the two systemswhen they held a news conference in Havana on Friday to trumpet theSoviet Union's March 26 parliamentary elections.   In Cuba, most forms of dissent are still banned ascounterrevolutionary and can carry long prison terms.   At a time when Gorbachev is searching for new ideas andproposing experiments to spur economic development, Castro haswarned that financial incentives for individuals and decentralizingthe economy are dangerous.   ``We must watch over the ideological purity of the revolution,''Castro told his nation on the 30th anniversary of his victory onJuly 26. ``That is why we cannot use any methods that reek ofcapitalism.''   Soviet officials and Western observers agree Gorbachev isunlikely to lecture the Cuban leader in public or respond directlyto his charges that Soviet reforms take too much from capitalism.   That would be seen as a direct contradiction of Gorbachev'soften-stated view that there is no one correct route to socialistdevelopment.   Diplomats in Havana and Moscow said it is unlikely Gorbachev iswilling to continue subsidizing the Cuban economy at present levelswhile faced with widespread shortages, deficit spending andincreasingly difficult economic problems at home.   According to U.S. estimates, the Kremlin provides Cuba from $4billion to $6 billion annually in economic and military assistance,and the aid programs and subsidies account for as much as 20percent of the Cuban gross national product.   The diplomats, speaking on condition of anonynmity, said theSoviets already appear to have reduced their purchases of Cubansugar, which they buy at higher-than-market prices as a way ofproviding Cuban foreign aid.   Some diplomats said they expect Gorbachev to tell Castro bluntly_ but in private _ that Cuban must put its economic house in order.   But they suggest Gorbachev may make a public show of superpowersupport by announcing the Soviet Union's willingness to forgive allor part of Cuba's ruble debt, which has accumulated in the 30 yearssince the Cuban Revolution.   To forgive a debt that is unlikely ever to be repaid actuallywould cost Gorbachev very little, one diplomat said, while raisingthe ante for Western industrialized countries that hold most of theThird World debt.   Gorbachev told the United Nations in December the Soviet Unionwas prepared to offer the least-developed countries a moratorium ondebt service and ``in quite a few cases to write off the debtaltogether'' if the West would go along with a program to solve thedebt problems of poorer countries.</TEXT></DOC>
