Clayton Robard's directors welcomed the bid, under which Tyndall is offering 6.40 dollars ($4.55) for each ordinary share and 9.60 dollars for each preferred share.    Tyndall yesterday raised its holdings in Clayton Robard to 19.9% from 2.3% by buying a 17.6% stake from the Darling family of Sydney in exchange for Tyndall shares valued at #31.8 million ($51 million). The British company plans a rights issue to raise as much as #142.7 million to buy additional Clayton Robard shares. It also has arranged bank credits of #53.3 million.    Garnet Harrison, Tyndall's chief executive officer, is a Clayton Robard director and formerly was managing director of Keywest Investments Ltd., which merged with Koitaki Ltd. in 1986 to form Clayton Robard.    The offer is conditioned on Tyndall's receiving approvals from Tyndall holders, London's stock exchange and Australia's Foreign Investment Reveiew Board, and on its obtaining acceptances for at least 50% of Clayton Robard's shares. </TEXT></DOC>
