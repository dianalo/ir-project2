The company says its new &quot;high definition imaging&quot;technology uses digital electronics to produce a muchsharper, more detailed picture of various body tissues andorgans than existing ultrasound machines that use analogtechniques.</LP><TEXT>   Ultrasound experts who have seen the new technology say itappears to be one of the biggest advances in ultrasoundtechnology in several years and should help doctors make suchdiagnostic decisions as whether a breast lump is malignant orbenign. In some instances, they say, the new technology mightpermit ultrasound to replace the more expensive magneticresonance imaging, or MRI, method of visualizing internalorgans. In other instances, the new ultrasound technologymight avoid the use of angiography, in which special dyes areinjected into blood vessels to make them visible in X-raypictures.   Ultrasound diagnosis is familiar to many mothers-to-be whohave undergone &quot;sonograms&quot; to show the position and size ofthe fetus. It is also widely used to diagnose breast lumpsinitially discovered by X-ray mammography, to evaluateuterine fibroids and ovarian cysts and to gauge the extent ofclogging of arteries in the neck and legs.   Advanced Technology is one of the two operating divisionsof Westmark, a Bothell, Wash., company that was spun off bySquibb Corp. when that drug maker merged in 1987 withBristol-Myers Co. Dennis Fill, a former Squibb president andchief operating officer, is president of Advanced Technologyand chairman of Westmark.   The company says it is introducing its new digitalultrasound technology as an option on new equipment or anupgrade of existing equipment for visualizing the breast,thyroid gland, testicles and similar tissues. Later it plansto add the new technology to machines used for gynecologicaland obstetric diagnoses and for heart and blood vesseldiagnoses.   The new technology is &quot;very exciting,&quot; says Dr. DennisSarti, director of diagnostic ultrasound at Cedars SinaiMedical Center in Los Angeles, who has been trying out thenew equipment for the last two weeks. &quot;I always try out newmachines on my own thyroid, and for the first time I thinkI've seen my parathyroid glands, which are only two or threemillimeters in diameter,&quot; Dr. Sarti says.   At the Yale University-New Haven Medical Center inConnecticut, radiologist Kenneth Taylor says the new machinemarkedly improves the visualization of internal organs andtissues through layers of fat and thus should improvediagnoses in obese patients. Dr. Sarti says the new method&quot;might well be every bit as good&quot; as MRI scans at diagnosingblood vessel disease in the legs or neck.   Ultrasound diagnoses are based on ultrasonic wavesdirected at the body that bounce back as echoes changed instrength and frequency. Each of the various tissues producesa unique echo that ultrasound diagnostic equipment canconvert to an image on a television screen. Images producedby ultrasound are shadowy and less detailed than X-ray imagesbut don't involve harmful radiation and can show organs inmotion and the flow of blood. A top-of-the-line ultrasoundmachine costs about $250,000, compared with more than $1million for an MRI system.   Much of the indistinct nature of sonograms results fromthe narrow &quot;bandwidth,&quot; or range of frequencies, that theequipment can process into an image. If frequencies of theechoes coming from the body differ by as much as five millioncycles a second -- five megahertz -- but the equipment canhandle a bandwidth of only two megahertz to make an image,then &quot;you've lost half the information,&quot; says Eugene Larson,executive vice president of Advanced Technology.   Mr. Larson says the company's advance involves a device,called a beamformer, that receives the incoming echoes andstores the signals until enough information is built up foran image. In the past, the echo information has been held inanalog form by tiny magnets. By &quot;going digital,&quot; AdvancedTechnology's beamformer can now handle a bandwidth of up to10 megahertz, or as much as twice the bandwidth of analogbeamformers.   Until recently, Mr. Larson adds, such digital conversionrequired four circuit boards in the ultrasonic imagingequipment. The advance that led to the new equipment was anew microchip that does the same job as the four circuitboards.</TEXT></DOC>
