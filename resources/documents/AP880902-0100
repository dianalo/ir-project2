(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A woman who posed either as a sexsurrogate or someone bored with sex on three TV talk shows says asex therapist asked her to ``play the part,'' but the therapistsays he didn't intend to deceive anyone.   Dean C. Dauw, a Chicago clinical psychologist, licensed sextherapist and author, defended himself during an appearance viasatellite Thursday on ``The Sally Jessy Raphael Show,'' which istaped here.   ``I never intended to perpetrate a ruse. I never said `Gopretend,''' Dauw said.   Appearing in person was Tani Freiwald, 37, a former officemanager for Dauw who earlier this year posed as either a sexsurrogate or a woman bored with sex on talk shows hosted byRaphael, Oprah Winfrey and Geraldo Rivera.   Wes Bailey, 33, also of Chicago, who pretended on one show to bea virgin and on another to be an impotent husband, also wasinterviewed via satellite. He and Ms. Freiwald have worked togetherin community theater.   Raphael said she decided to do the program with the three, to bebroadcast Sept. 8, to give the public a chance to question peoplewho had ``blatantly lied.''   Dauw said he had given Ms. Freiwald some training in sexualsurrogacy and ``I thought her to be functioning as a surrogate.''   ``I assumed, perhaps falsely, she was working with my othertherapist,'' he said.   Ms. Freiwald said she had done some research into sex surrogacybut decided it was not for her, and she charged that Dauw has askedher: ``Do you think you can play the part?''   ``You asked me to dress provocatively for these parts. You askedme to look like I was a sexy girl,'' she said.   Dauw said he may also have falsely assumed that Bailey, a friendof Ms. Freiwald's, was working with his other therapist. ``We wereacting in good faith,'' said Dauw. ``It is very easy to haveunclear communications or miscommunications.''   Ms. Freiwald said she had decided to play the part of a sexsurrogate on Raphael's show because it was ``an improvisationalchallenge I didn't think I could pass up'' and an opportunity tosee how one of her favorite talk shows is produced.   Ms. Freiwald said the deception had an educational value in thatit showed ``you have to be a critical, analytical, participatorywatcher of television.''   Bailey said he agreed to take part in the trickery because ``Ifelt it was like going white-water rafting or climbing a mountain.''</TEXT></DOC>
