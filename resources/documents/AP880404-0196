The Beijing Medical University researcher recently saw thesuccess of three years of work when a 39-year-old primary schoolteacher bore China's first test-tube baby, a girl.   The birth, nearly 10 years after the world's first test-tubebaby, Louise Joy Brown, was born in England, was celebrated as anational achievement, proof that China can master advanced medicalprocedures.   It also was a sign of the government's relatively recent supportfor programs to help the infertile, overcoming opponents who arguethat the last thing China needs is more babies.   Large families once were a tradition in China, and boys werefavored because they could help support the family later on. Butwith the population burgeoning, the government instituted rigorousbirth control measures in the late 1970s and each couple wasrestricted to one child. The government's goal is to achieve zeropopulation growth by the year 2000.   The penalties for couples who have more than one child can afine and the loss of valued government or work benefits.   But there was rejoicing when Zheng Mengzhu, the 8{-pound,test-tube girl was born March 10, for it meant a breakthrough forthose couples unable to have the one child permitted by law.   Mengzhu's picture and her mother's were published on the frontpages of leading newspapers, and China Central Television broadcastan operating-room interview with the mother after the delivery byCaesarean section.   ``If she's clever enough and studies hard I want her to become adoctor or lawyer,'' said the mother, Zheng Guizhen, who spent herentire nine months of pregnancy in the hospital to ensure nothingwent wrong.   ``Everything was smooth,'' said Mrs. Zhang, the doctor. ``Shehad some morning sickness but no high blood pressure.''   But Mrs. Zhang is taking no chances with this baby, a smallsymbol of China's progress in medicine. She isn't letting themother and child make the arduous, four-day trip to the family'shome in rural northwest China until the weather is warmer and thebaby is several months old.   Meanwhile, Mrs. Zhang is closely watching the progress of awoman pregnant with China's second test-tube child, due in May.   She also has conducted two gamete fallopian transfers, analternate method of artificial fertilization in which the doctorplaces the mother's eggs and father's sperm together in the woman'sFallopian tubes, instead of in a laboratory dish.   Mrs. Zhang's first attempt ended in a miscarriage, but thesecond resulted in the birth of Zheng Mengzhu.   Mrs. Zhang, aided by eight other doctors, began her test-tubebaby program in 1984 at the Beijing Medical University's No. 3Teaching Hospital. In 1986, the government made producing atest-tube baby one of the goals of China's Five-Year Plan, andappointed Mrs. Zhang to head the effort.   The government allocated the yuan equivalent of only $108,000for the task, a sum Mrs. Zhang said showed ``spiritual support''but fell far short of the need.   To observe the procedure in action, she and two assistantsvisited doctors in the United States who did pioneering work in thefield.   But her own relatively primitive laboratory facilities, shesaid, could not match those of the American doctors. In winter, shehad trouble just keeping the lab warm enough for the delicate eggand sperm cultures. Many Chinese public buildings have little or noheat.   Mrs. Zhang said she implanted artifically fertilized eggs in thewombs of 14 patients without success before the two pregnanciesresulted.   ``I feel just a bit relieved that I fulfilled what I said Iwould,'' Mrs. Zhang said after Mengzhu's birth. ``Actually it'snothing very outstanding _ it's almost the 6,000th test-tube babyworldwide _ but in China I think it's very hard to do this work dueto our facilities and public opinion.''   Many believe China has no need for artificial fertilization whenthe natural birth rate threatens to outpace the food supply.   ``One of the reasons we started this program quite late is thatwe knew there would be different opinions,'' Mrs. Zhang said.``Everybody knows China is overpopulated.''   But the law permits all couples to have one child, she added,even the infertile. She said hundreds of women have written orvisited to seek her help, some in tears because of family pressureto produce a child, especially a son.   ``Probably the woman will be mistreated by her mother-in-lawbecause she can't give birth,'' Mrs. Zhang said. ``Some even thinkof suicide.''   Mrs. Zheng, China's first test-tube mother, said as shebreastfed her baby, ``Most people can't understand how a womansuffers when she hasn't had a baby.   ``For 20 years, I expected I would have a child but couldn't. IfDr. Zhang had not given me a child I would not have wanted to keepliving.''   China does not keep statistics on the number of infertilecouples. Mrs. Zhang estimated that about 50,000 women might becandidates for test-tube fertilization, but emphasized that nostudies have been done.   Traditionally, women who could not become pregnant madeofferings to the Earth God and ate herbs believed to increasefertility. Mrs. Zhang said some herbs appear to help in individualcases, although the reason has not been researched.   Since 1981, sperm banks have opened in several major cities,including Beijing, Canton, Shanghai and Chungking. They haveclaimed dozens of pregnancies.   At least four hospitals or research institutes in addition tothe Beijing Medical University have begun test-tube baby programs,although none has yet produced a pregnancy.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Mon AMs, April 11</NOTE></DOC>
