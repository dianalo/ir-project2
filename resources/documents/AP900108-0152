Pedigrees count for naught. Most of them have beenrescued from the pound.   These dogs easily work for up to six hours in frigidtemperatures, sniffing charred debris, even through ice and water.Park Avenue dogs, with their little cold-weather outfits for15-minute walks, need not apply.   The top requirement for these dogs is to have the will andstamina to play all day long, because for them, it is a game.   For arson investigators, it is serious business.   The investigators credit these dogs with helping bring infirst-degree murder indictments, saving hundreds of man-hours andthousands of tax dollars, and they say their true potential isstill unknown.   They are officially called Accelerant Detection Dogs and theprogram is one of the newest ways to use man's best friend.Trainers estimate there are only about two dozen trained dogs inabout a dozen states thus far.   The dogs are trained to take the investigator to the spot wherean arsonist poured gasoline, alcohol, fingernail polish remover orsome other inflammable liquid.   The dogs must find all of the spots where the accelerants werepoured, which is why trainers stress the importance of the dog'sinnate play drive. After he is rewarded for the first find, he'scalled upon to keep looking until he exhausts all possible sites.   One of the reasons investigators collect multiple samples isthat the dogs are better than the sophisticated equipment back atthe laboratory. The dogs, they think, can sniff out parts pertrillion. The best science can do is parts per million. Handlersare often sure their dogs are correct, but the equipment cannotcorroborate it.   The dogs can also differentiate between accelerants and similarchemical gases normally found at a fire scene when items such asplastic have burned. The field equipment often gives false positivereadings. The dogs don't.   ``He doesn't make mistakes,'' says Michael E. Knowlton, a NewYork state arson investigator who has a 90-pound yellow Labradorretriever named Buddy. New York state has two dogs, available toevery city and county.   In Maryland, the second state in the country to have anarson-sniffing dog, Barney was instrumental in the first-degreemurder indictments of an arsonist in the deaths of three children.   Barney, a 123-pound black Labrador, picked the suspect out of alineup. Four men plus the suspect were standing in a room when JohnFarrell, Barney's handler, opened the door and sent the big dog in.Barney roamed around, then sat down directly in front of thesuspect. All of the dogs sit when they make a positiveidentification. Some, like Barney, will go a step further.   ``Show me,'' commanded Farrell. Barney put his nose on the man'sshoes.   The FBI lab confirmed the dog's findings: kerosene on the shoes.Barney had earlier identified the spots where kerosene had beenpoured at the fire site.   The man goes to trial in late March.   Barney and John Farrell, chief of operations in the Arson K-9Unit in Baltimore, have traveled up and down the East Coast helpingstates without arson-sniffing dogs of their own.   The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms in Connecticut,along with the Connecticut State Police, trained the first arsonsniffing dog.   Farrell, who had trained hunting dogs for more than 40 years,heard about the program and went up to Connecticut to investigate.He could not get government funds when he got back to Maryland.   ``In frustration, I trained my own dog to see if I could do whatI saw. I wanted to prove that it worked,'' says Farrell, who hasalmost 25 years of service in the Maryland state fire marshal'soffice.   Thanks to the success of Barney, the nation's second arson dog,Maryland now has six arson dogs.   New Jersey Police Sgt. Dennis McSweeny, a K-9 instructor formany years, has trained many of the dogs for other states. The twodogs working for New York state, Buddy and Hershey, were trained byMcSweeny in a 10-week course in Atlantic City, N.J.   McSweeny and Farrell know of arson dogs in North and SouthCarolina, Maine, Florida, Washington, Iowa and Kansas, as well asNew York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Maryland.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
