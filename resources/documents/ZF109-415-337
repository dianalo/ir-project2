(the digital workbench provides agraphically oriented testing interface)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Geary, Greg.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>The digital workbench (DWB) is a graphically oriented interfaceand collection of tools for 'in-circuit, functional and cluster'testing.andP;  It is implemented with the Computer Aided Design DataInterface Format (CADDIF) which provides bidirectional operationto a simulator and to testing equipment.andP;  The DWB supports theimport of vector and timing data, fault directory, andgood-activity data.andP;  The general test programming process consistsof evaluating the device to be tested, importing a net-list orsignal list from a computer-aided design system, drawing thetiming characteristics, assembling test sequences, simulation todetermine fault coverage, and verification of test vectors againsta unit under test.andP;  The combination of a DWB with other automateddesign systems can significantly speed the product design andimplementation process.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Circuit DesignTestingProgrammingGraphics SystemsSpecificationsImplementationComputer-Aided Engineering.andO;Feature:   illustrationchart.andO;Caption:   The digital workbench allows users to 'draw' test procedures.andO;(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT></DOC>
