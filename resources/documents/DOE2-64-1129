Several centuriesago he fully depended upon the energy of his muscles and the energy thathe received from the sun. Today we cannot think of any activity withoutusing energy from external sources in one form or the other. Energy hasthus joined the rank of food and shelter, the two essential requirementsfor the existence of human race. Efforts are being made to search fornew energy sources which are long lasting, easily available and are pollutionfree. Since solar energy has all these qualities and human beings havebeen using this energy in different forms from the very beginning, intensiveefforts are being made to utilise solar energy for various applicationsall over the world. Discussed in this paper are the conversion and utilisationof solar radiant energy, through the thermal route only, and the solarthermal energy program in India.</TEXT></DOC>
