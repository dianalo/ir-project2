The feature has since been reported in Comet Wilson. The presenceof the feature is of considerable interest for a number of reasons. First,it may represent the detection of a new parent molecule, and when combinedwith data from Giotto and Vega yield new information on cometary chemistryand the early solar system composition. Secondly, it may represent alink to the interstellar medium, the feature corresponds in wavelengthand shape with an interstellar feature seen in absorption in a luminousstar, towards the Galactic center known as GC-IRS7. The feature in turnis thought to be related with a growing family of unidentified infraredemission features seen in stellar objects, planetary nebulae, reflectionnebulae, HII regions and extra galactic sources. These features occurat wavelengths 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, and 11.25 micrometers. Furtheridentification theory is given.</TEXT></DOC>
