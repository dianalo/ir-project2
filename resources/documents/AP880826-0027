This fiscal year's export value is expected to jump 22 percentto a four-year high of $34 billion, up from $27.9 billion in1986-87, the department said Thursday.   Shipments were forecast at 146 million metric tons in the yearthat will end Sept. 30, up 13 percent from last year.   Both the value and quantity estimates were up from the previousUSDA forecasts on May 26 of $33.5 billion and 145.5 million tons.   Although the report cited no figures for subsequent years, itsaid export values may increase in 1988-89 due to higher prices butthe volume of shipments may decline.   In another report last week, the department's Economic ResearchService said the volume of 1989 wheat exports may drop 12 percentfrom this year; corn, 4 percent; and soybeans, 29 percent.   Thursday's report said the rise in 1988 estimates since Maystemmed from larger-than-expected exports of animal products,slightly larger subsidized wheat exports, and higher corn pricesdue to the drought.   Noting that 1987-88 exports are now expected to be up $6.1billion and 16.8 million tons, the report said, ``This largelyreflects reduced competitor supplies; higher prices for grains,oilseeds and cotton; and increased U.S. export competitiveness''helped by a lower-valued dollar and the Export Enhancement Program,or EEP.   Under EEP, selected countries _ including the Soviet Union andChina _ can get wheat and other designated commodities subsidizedby the U.S. government.   The new forecast showed the value of grain exports at $12.2billion, up from $11.8 billion expected in May and 1986-87shipments worth $9.33 billion.   Oilseeds, mainly soybeans, were forecast at $7.6 billion, downslightly from $7.7 billion indicated three months ago. But that wasup from $6.47 billion last year.   Exports of livestock products this year were raised to $4.7billion from the May forecast of $4.5 billion. In 1986-87, thosewere valued at $3.96 billion.   Other major categories included: horticultural products, $3.7billion this year, the same as indicated in May but up from $3.15billion in 1986-87. Cotton export values were shown at $2.2billion, the same as the earlier forecast. Last year's cottonshipments were worth $1.43 billion.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   World cigarette production climbed 2.9 percentlast year to 5.12 trillion cigarettes, or ``pieces,'' says anAgriculture Department analysis.   ``China, accounting for 28 percent of the world cigaretteproduction, continues to be the driving force behind thisincrease,'' the report said Thursday. ``China's output in 1987increased 10 percent to 1.4 trillion pieces, registeringdouble-digit growth for the fourth consecutive year.''   Not including China, world output remained nearly unchanged at1.43 trillion cigarettes, although U.S. production rose 6 percentto 689.4 billion pieces.   Other countries posting gains of 3 billion or more cigarettes in1987 included the Soviet Union, Poland, Spain, Philippines, Mexico,Hong Kong, Bulgaria and South Korea.   ``Increased production in the United States, Hong Kong andBulgaria went towards expanded exports,'' the report said.``Production increases in the remaining countries were generally inresponse to increased domestic consumption.''   But some countries showed significant production cuts last year.Japan led the way as cigarette output declined 10 percent to 266.4billion pieces, the report said.   ``This reduction was a result of a dramatic increase in importsthat reduced the market share of domestically producedcigarettes,'' the report said.   Other countries showing reduced production in 1987 includedIndia, Brazil, West Germany, Romania, Italy, France, Syria andYugoslavia.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The National Association of Wheat Growers saysa plan by the Agriculture Department to change price support loanprocedures should be withdrawn.   Frank Johannsen, president of the association, said Thursdaythat wheat growers strongly oppose USDA's Aug. 10 proposal ``toprovide that 1987 and all subsequent crops of wheat, feed grains,rice and soybeans would be ineligible for an extension of theoriginal 9-month loan.''   The support loans are made to farmers who then are required torepay the loans when due or forfeit the grain to the department'sCommodity Credit Corp. It has been a common practice in periods ofabundance to extend the loans, allowing the grain to be kept offthe market longer and not depress prices.   Johannsen said in a letter filed with USDA that he recognizedthe market situation changed in 1988 because of the drought butthat it does not justify prohibiting loan extensions on futurecrops.   ``Decisions on future loan extensions should be made on ayear-to-year basis and should be based on U.S. stocks, productionand projected domestic and world demand,'' he said.   The USDA policy affecting loan extensions and the farmer-ownedreserve program, in which grain is stored over extended periodsuntil rising prices force their release, is facing legal challengesby a group of farmers in U.S. District Court, St. Paul, Minn.</TEXT></DOC>
