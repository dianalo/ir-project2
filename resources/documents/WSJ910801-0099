Venture-capital funding for small companies plunged 66% inthe first quarter, industry researchers report.</LP><TEXT>   Investments declined to $185 million from $539 million ayear earlier, says Venture Economics Publishing Co., anindustry research concern in Needham, Mass. The number ofcompanies getting funds slid to 173 from 333. With thedecline continuing in the second quarter, venture capital forsmall companies could sink below $1 billion for 1991, lessthan half 1990's $2.1 billion, Venture Economics says.   &quot;The downward trend in venture investing has intensified,&quot;says David Schutt, editor in chief of Venture Economics. Hesays big institutions, disappointed by recent returns, arescaling back their involvement in venture funds. Only 15venture-capital funds raised money from investors in thefirst half of this year -- a combined $541 million, off 43%from $954 million a year earlier.   Analysts say the recession has also slowed the flow ofmoney, as venture capitalists negotiate bargain prices forstakes in struggling concerns.   Direct investments in small companies by big corporationsare offsetting some of the decline, Mr. Schutt says.Investments by International Business Machines Corp., XeroxCorp., American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. and others &quot;couldpick up some of the slack,&quot; he says.   ---   LOCAL LENDERS GET TOUGHER with their small-businesscustomers.   Community bankers, sobered by the regulatory crackdown andthe recession, are tightening the credit screws.   Nearly two-thirds of community bankers surveyed by thePrivate Company Practices Section of the American Instituteof CPAs said they were applying more stringent standards tosmaller customers. Fully 10% said they had turned awaycreditworthy borrowers. Community banks, most of which haveassets between $50 million and $200 million, deal mostly withsmall companies.   Of the banks surveyed, 65% said they were demanding morecollateral, and 59% reported employing more restrictivecovenants.   &quot;When I now lend to someone, I don't just see hisbusiness, I go to the guy's house. And I don't just speak tohim, I speak to his wife,&quot; says Robert Rader, chief executiveofficer of Destin Bank, a community bank in Destin, Fla.Michael Ross, president of Capital Bank andamp; Trust Co. ofClayton, Mo., says pressure from regulators is drivinglenders to take a tougher stance.   &quot;There's a changed -- and strained -- relationship betweenbankers and their customers,&quot; says Jerrel A. Atkinson ofAtkinson andamp; Co., an Albuquerque, N.M., accounting firm.&quot;Borrowers feel that banks aren't going out of their way tohelp them anymore. They feel they're instead being burdenedwith paperwork and costly requirements.&quot;   The tight lending isn't going to ease soon, says Mr.Rader. &quot;Bankers finally are recognizing they aren't lendingtheir own money; they are lending someone else's,&quot; he says.   ---   PUBLIC OFFERINGS by small companies are a big hit withinvestors.   The boom in new stock offerings is giving small concerns awindow of opportunity -- and they are scrambling through.GMIS Inc., a Malvern, Pa., company with 1990 revenue of $6.1million, last week sold 1,250,000 shares at $13 each in a newoffering that was oversubscribed. GMIS, which is profitable,designs software that helps insurers and large corporationscontain costs for health care and workers-compensationprograms. Similarly, Meris Labs, a San Jose, Calif., clinicallaboratory company with sales last year of $13.8 million,recently sold 2.1 million shares at $9.25 each. Meris also isprofitable.   Small concerns that last year might have had a difficulttime raising money privately are finding smooth sailing inpublic offerings, says Sorrell Mathes, senior managingdirector of Furman Selz Inc., one of the underwriters of theGMIS offering.   &quot;There's a tremendous appetite among institutionalinvestors for small companies,&quot; says Edward Mathias, managingdirector of T. Rowe Price Associates, a Baltimoremoney-management firm. And because shares of new issues havebeen performing well, &quot;many buyers of small-company sharesnaturally are turning to the new-issues market,&quot; he says.   Institutional investors, who traditionally favored biggerconcerns, are becoming more willing to consider smallcompanies with growth potential, says Parag Saxena, managingdirector of Chancellor Capital Management, a New York moneymanager. &quot;Any company in the business of cost-containment isbound to be a hit with investors,&quot; he says.   The creation of specialized funds to buy small publiccompanies financed by venture capitalists has added to theranks of potential buyers, says Mr. Mathias of T. Rowe Price.These funds, such as Brinson Partners' Post-Venture Fund andT. Rowe Price's Threshold Fund, are buying into many smallcompanies that might be shunned by traditional institutionalinvestors, he says.   ---   OFF-BALANCE-SHEET financing for biotechnology researchgains momentum.   Such transactions -- commonly the sale of research anddevelopment partnerships or of stock in spinoffs -- giveoutsiders a chance to profit directly from future researchbreakthroughs. Small companies get long-term capital forresearch without reducing earnings.   Last month, Gensia Pharmaceuticals Inc. said it soldresearch and development partnership interests for $26.2million. The funds will be used to develop the SanDiego-based biotechnology concern's system for the diagnosisof coronary-artery disease.   In May, Genetics Institute Inc. sold $37.3 million ofstock in a spinoff concern that will develop, among otherthings, its technology to treat cancers, infectious diseasesand cardiovascular diseases. And Synergen Inc. this yearraised more than $50 million to fund the development of itsIL-1 drug to treat a variety of diseases, includingrheumatoid arthritis and septic shock.   Aside from leaving balance sheets intact, such financingsenable small companies to retain rights to technologies orproducts that might be lost in joint ventures or corporateinvestments, says Mark Simon, a biotechnology analyst withRobertson, Stephens andamp; Co. The recent surge in biotechnologystocks, spurred by booming sales at some companies andgovernment approvals of several new drugs at others, iskeeping investor interest high.   &quot;There are more companies and more products to do suchdeals with,&quot; says Linda Miller, who follows biotechnology forPaineWebber Inc.</TEXT></DOC>
