The general approachbeing proposed is a tiered safe-harbor system keyed to the continued soundcapitalization of an insured institution after giving effect to such transactions.This approach prohibits such transactions by institutions with net capitalbelow their fully phased-in capital requirement unless the Board has givenprior authorization, while giving institutions that meet their fully phased-incapital requirement and have received ratings of 1 or 2 under the MACROsupervisory ratings system (``MACRO system'') significant flexibility toeffect such transactions out of capital in excess of their fully phased-incapital requirement.<ITAG tagnum="84">I. Reasons for Amending the Board's Current Regulation </ITAG>Capital distributions in the form of dividends, stock repurchases, andcash-out mergers \1\<NOTE/> (collectively ``capital distributions'' or ``capital-distributingtransactions'') all reduce insured institutions' tangible capital and distributea portion of that capital to third parties that generally are not partof the FSLIC deposit insurance system. These three types of transactionsof constitute capital-distributing transactions because they representdifferent ways in which investors can recover their initial investmentsand a return on such investments; in the case of dividends and stock repurchases,the distribution is made to the institution's own shareholders; in a cash-outmerger, the cash payment made by an acquiring institution is to the stockholdersof the institution it is acquiring. Currently, however, these transactionsare not treated uniformly, despite their similar economic consequencesfor insured institutions and the FSLIC.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ A cash-out merger is a transaction in which an acquiringinstitution pays cash to the shareholders of a target insured institutionto acquire ownership of and to merge with the target insured institution.The terms ``cash-out merger,'' as used in this regulation, includes anypayment to the shareholders of a target institution by an acquiring insuredinstitution, other than a distribution of shares of the acquiring insuredinstitution, to purchase ownership of a target institution from its shareholders.The Board believes that uniform treatment of these transactions by regulationwould provide a consistent Board policy regarding insured institutions'capital needs and the necessity of preserving and enhancing the tangiblecapital levels of all institutions. Adequate capital is essential to thesafe and sound operation of insured institutions because it provides abuffer to absorb losses resulting from insured institutions' operationaland financial policies. Furthermore, in order to protect their equity interestsand the market for their shares, investors may impose a prudential disciplineon institutions' management and on their policies and strategies. A uniformapproach would better address the Board's concerns regarding institutions'distribution of their capital, which serves to reduce the institutions'capital cushions and, when such a reduction occurs, to increase FSLIC'sloss exposure. In formulating a rule, however, the Board believes it is imperative toencourage capital formation and to attract new investors in FSLIC-insuredinstitutions. To facilitate the raising of capital by insured institutionsin the capital markets, the Board seeks to assure investors that insuredinstitutions in which they have equity stakes will be subject to consistent,reasonable capital requirements. Furthermore, when those requirements aremet, those investors will have the ability to redeploy surplus capitalin ways that meet their own investment objectives.To protect depositors and the insurance fund while encouraging such capitalformation, the Board is proposing to adopt a safe-harbor approach, allowingcapital distributions by insured institutions within parameters set bythe Board. This safe-harbor approach would predicate institutions' capitaldistributions to shareholders on the institutions' capital levels and supervisoryratings under the MACRO system. This would enable the owners of institutionsmeeting their fully phased-in capital requirements and not presenting significantsupervisory problems to redeploy capital in excess of their fully phased-inlevels (``surplus capital'') to meet their own business needs and investmentobjectives. For example, a holding company owning an insured institutionwith surplus capital may wish to shift capital to other subsidiaries inlight of their current business needs and subsequently to reinvest suchcapital in the insured institution if the institution's capital needs increase.In the interest of the safety and soundness of the depository system, however,the safe-harbor seeks to ensure that insured institutions making such capitaldistributions remain soundly capitalized, thereby providing a strong capitalbuffer protecting depositors and the insurance fund from loss. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Current Treatment of Capital Distributions; Dividends, Stock Repurchasesand Cash-Out Mergers </ITAG>Dividend payments, stock repurchases, and cash-out mergers are currentlytreated in dissimilar ways despite their similar economic consequencesfor an institution's capitalization. The treatment of dividend paymentsis based on the type of transaction and on factors such as how long agothe institution converted from mutual to stock form and whether the institutionis affiliated with a holding company. Stock repurchases are currently onlycontrolled as a general matter by regulation if the institution has convertedfrom mutual to stock form, with substantially greater restrictions applyingif the conversion has been within the last three years. Currently, <T3>de novo </T3>stock institutions are not subject to regulatory limitationon their dividend payments or stock repurchases. Finally, cash-out mergershave been dealt with on an application-by-application basis in accordancewith evolving perspectives of the Board. The following is a discussionof the current treatment of each type of transaction.A. DividendsThe ability of an insured institution to pay dividends may be, but is notalways subject to restriction, with restrictions varying markedly, dependingon whether the institution is a converted institution or is owned by aholding company.A converted institution is prohibited from paying cash dividends if, ona <T3>pro forma </T3>basis, the insured institution's regulatory capitalwould be reduced below its regulatory capital requirement or the amountrequired for the institution's liquidation account. <T3>See </T3>12 CFR 563b.3(g)(2). Converted institutions also are prohibitedfor the first three years after conversion from paying cash dividends inexcess of one-half of the greater of: (1) the converted institution's netincome for the current fiscal year, or (2) the average of the institution'snet income for the current fiscal year and not more than two precedingfiscal years. <T3>See </T3>12 CFR 563b.3(g)(3).As a condition to the approval of holding company applications, the Boarduntil recently had routinely imposed a condition that a subsidiary insuredinstitution of a holding company may not declare or pay dividends in anyfiscal year exceeding 50 percent of the subsidiary insured institution'snet income for that fiscal year, although permitted dividends could bedeferred and paid in a subsequent fiscal year. In no event, however, coulddividends be paid that would cause the insured institution's capital tofall below its regulatory capital requirement under 12 CFR 563.13(b) orsuccessor regulations.The Board's basic approach to limitations on payments of dividends hasbeen modified recently in connection with the recent Board policy statementon ``Regulatory Capital Maintenance Obligations of Acquirers of InsuredInstitutions'', adopted on August 12, 1988, 53 FR 31761 (Aug. 19, 1988),and the supplemental guidelines, ``Net Worth Maintenance and PrenuptialAgreements,'' issued by the Office of Regulatory Activities on October19, 1988. The current form of dividend restriction agreement required fromacquirers of insured institutions in general employs a tiered capital approachfor dividends that is similar to, but less conservative than, the approachproposed herein.In sum, the present dividend agreement employed to implement the guidelinesuses a three tier approach keyed to an institution's ``net capital''.\2\<NOTE/> An institution with net capital equal to or in excess ofits fully phased-in capital requirement pursuant to 12 CFR 563.13, as modifiedby 12 CFR 563.14 and 563.14-1, may pay dividends in any quarter up to theamount of its cumulative net income for the preceding eight quarters asreflected on the institution's quarterly reports to the Board, less cumulativedividends paid in such prior eight quarters, without prior approval ofthe institution's Supervisory Agent. These institutions are only allowedto pay out 100% of their cumulative net income over the prior eight quartersif the dividend payments would not cause the institution to fall belowits fully phased-in capital requirement.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Net capital is an institution's capital as defined undergenerally accepted accounting principles (``GAAP capital'') plus qualifyingsubordinated debt and redeemable preferred stock.If an institution's net capital exceeds its regulatory capital requirement,but is less than its fully phased-in capital requirement, the institutionmay not pay dividends exceeding 50 percent of its cumulative net incomefor the prior eight quarters as reflected on its quarterly reports to theBoard, less cumulative dividends paid for such prior eight quarters, withoutprior approval of its Supervisory Agent. These institutions cannot makedividend payments without approval if the payout would result in the institutionfalling below its minimum regulatory capital requirements.An institution may not pay a dividend without approval of its SupervisoryAgent if its net capital is below its regulatory capital requirement orwould fall below its regulatory capital requirement after paying the dividend.This proposed regulation would apply a similar, but more conservative,approach to all institutions' capital distributions.The Board has also modified both the old and the new dividend restrictionson a case-by-case basis, however, in approving some applications involvingwell-capitalized insured institutions. For example, one institution wasauthorized to pay out dividends up to 100 percent of its net income eachyear provided that its capital as computed under generally accepted accountingprinciples remained at or above 10 percent of its total liabilities.Finally, the Board previously has proposed to adopt a regulation prohibitingany insured institution from paying dividends or making stock repurchasesif, after giving effect to the transaction, the insured institution's regulatorycapital would be less than the institution's regulatory capital requirementunder section 563.13. <T3>See </T3>Board Res. No. 85-10, 50 FR 52462 (December 24, 1985) (``CorporateGovernance II'').B. Stock Repurchases Currently, the only general restrictions on stock repurchases by insuredinstitutions are the restrictions applicable to stock repurchases by convertedinstitutions, which are the same restrictions applicable to dividend paymentsby such converted institutions. This includes the 50 percent of net incometest if the institution converted within the last three years. <T3>See </T3>12 CFR 563b.3(g)(2) and (g)(3). Furthermore, the Board inCorporate Governance II also proposed that stock repurchases by all insuredinstitutions be treated in the same manner as dividend payments. Accordingly,such repurchases would be permitted only if the insured institution ona <T3>pro forma </T3>basis would continue to meet its regulatory capitalrequirement under 12 CFR 563.13. Logically, this capital floor for dividendsand stock repurchases would be the capital requirement andSection; 563.13,as modified by 12 CFR 563.14 and 563.14-1. In addition, no converted institution may repurchase any of its stock fromany person for three years after conversion with the exception of: (i)A repurchase on a <T3>pro rata </T3>basis pursuant to an offer approved by the Board andmade to all shareholders of such institution, (ii) the repurchase of qualifyingshares of a director, or (iii) the purchase on the open market by the institution'stax-qualified or non-tax-qualified employee stock benefit plan in an amountreasonable and appropriate to fund the plan. <T3>See </T3>12 CFR 563.b(g)(1). Additionally, andSection; 563b.3(g)(4),adopted by the Board on January 20, 1988, preapproves open market repurchaseprograms provided that the following conditions are met: (i) No more than5 percent of the insured institution's or holding company's outstandingcapital stock is to be repurchased during any six-month period, (ii) theinsured institution's ratio of regulatory capital to total liabilitieswould not be reduced below 6 percent of total liabilities, and (iii) therepurchases would not adversely affect the financial condition of the insuredinstitution. Board. Res. No. 88-31, Jan. 20, 1988, 53 FR 2477 (Jan. 28,1988). C. Cash-Out Mergers Cash-out mergers can have similar effects to dividends and stock repurchases,although the analysis is more subtle. From the perspective of the acquiringthrift, a cash-out merger is just a purchase of an asset_albeit, a comparativelylarge purchase and one that carries both assets and liabilities and henceincreases the leverage of the resulting entity. From the perspective ofthe depository insurance system, however, the transaction represents acash payment by the acquiror to the shareholders of the acquired institutionwithout a corresponding decrease in the institution's liabilities. Consequently,the new combined institution has less capital to support the same levelof assets, thereby decreasing its capital-to-assets ratio. The greaterleverage of the resulting entity is a reflection of the system-wide reductionin net worth. To demonstrate the similarity between a cash-out merger anda stock repurchase, the following example is illustrative. Assume thata merger was effected through payment to the acquired thrift's stockholdersof shares of new ``class B'' stock issued by the acquiring thrift. Subsequently,the resulting entity repurchases all of the class B stock. The net effectwould be the same as if the merger had originally been a cash-out merger.In considering the proposed approach to cash-out mergers, it is worthwhilenoting that the Federal Reserve Board has adopted a policy against diminutionin capital strength to support expansion proposals.\3\<NOTE/> Under this policy, the FRB will only approve an expansionproposal if, before consummation of the acquisition, the acquiring bankraises new equity capital replacing most of its cash outlay for the acquisitionand commits to raise additional new capital within a short time periodto replace the remainder of its cash outlay. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ <T3>See </T3>Citicorp, 72 Federal Reserve Bulletin 497 (1986). <T3>See Id. </T3>Security Pacific Corporation, 72 Federal Reserve Bulletin800 (1986); New York Company, Inc., 74 Federal Reserve Bulletin 257, 264-265(1988). <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Recent Dividend Experience of Insured Institutions</ITAG>The Board's Office of Policy and Economic Research has conducted a preliminaryreview of the dividend payment history of insured institutions from 1984through 1988 (annualized based on the first three quarters). Other variablefactors considered were the institution's capital levels and holding companyaffiliations. The Board stresses, however, that this preliminary review of insured institutions'dividend records is not meant to provide economic or supervisory evidenceto the need for a proposal with the exact criteria of this proposed regulation.Furthermore, this study does not attempt to draw a direct correlation betweendividends paid and the FSLIC's loss experience. Rather, the Board is makinga safety and soundness oriented determination that institutions failingtheir minimum capital requirement should be subject to restrictions ontheir capital payouts, which delay attainment of sound capitalization.The Board further believes it is necessary to impose a reasonable limitationon capital distributions by institutions with capital exceeding their fullyphased-in requirements because accounting information is imperfect andnet worth levels can be subject to rapid swings.The following brief analysis of institutions' recent dividend paymentswas undertaken by staff and is set forth here to provide a summary understandingof the perceived need for and level of dividends paid by managers of institutionsin exercising their discretion under current regulations.  The preliminary review and analysis of average dividends paid by institutionsin stock form led to the following observations, including identificationthat there are a number of undercapitalized institutions paying substantialdividends despite the institutions' risk to the insurance fund. First,many stock institutions did not pay any dividends over the period. Second,dividend payments by thrifts paying dividends at least once during theperiod averaged 2.36 percent of capital and 23.8 percent of after-tax income.Third, thrifts with negative capital paid few dividends in the four yearperiod, and none after 1986. Finally, insitutions affiliated with holdingcompanies consistently had higher dividend averages than non-holding companyaffiliated insitutions. When only those thrifts paying dividends duringthe period were considered, however, the differences fell significantly. The staff also reviewed the dividend payment record of insured institutionsduring this period on a median basis. Since the distributions of thriftdividend/income and dividend/capital ratios are highly skewed, the average(mean) dividend rate differs substantially from the median rate. Some institutionsas reflected by the average data discussed above, paid greater dividendsthan income received, or paid a significant fraction of capital out individends. On the other hand, many stock institutions have never paid anydividends. If the thrifts that never paid dividends are omitted, the medianratio of annual dividend payments to annual income was 5.1 percent of income.The median ratio of annual dividend payments, by such institutions to theirGAAP capital was 0.33 percent of their GAAP capital. Another observationis that the median dividend ratios of thrifts affiliated with holding companieswere generally higher than those of non-holding company affiliated thrifts. Finally, the analysis reflected that some institutions with negative capitalmay have paid high dividends in earlier quarters in anticipation of insolvency.Of 319 thrifts that became insolvent from 1984 through September 1988,16 (about 5 percent) of them paid dividends greater than 5 percent of bookcapital in the quarters prior to insolvency, or paid dividends after capitalfell below zero. Of this group, six were affiliated with holding companies.Obviously, such dividends allow investors to recoup their investment whileincreasing the financial loss that the insurance fund must absorb.  For example, of the 1049 stock-issuing thrifts that operated in all fourquarters of 1986, 692 had GAAP capital below 6 percent of assets. Of theseinstitutions, 191 paid some dividends and 54 paid dividends in excess of50 percent of their after-tax income.  In 1988, there were 1167 stock issuing thrifts operating during all fourquarters. Of these institutions 720 had a GAAP capital-to-assets ratiobelow 6 percent. Of the thrifts in this group, 209 paid dividends, and984 paid dividends in excess of 50 percent of 1988 after-tax income.  The Board views the dividend payment record of well-capitalized insuredinstitutions as generally reflecting reasonable management action consistentwith the Board's policy views and well within the parameters establishedby this proposed regulation. The record, however, also reflects that institutionsneeding to reach their fully phased-in capital level are paying dividends,thereby delaying attainment of that goal. Accordingly, the Board is proposingthis regulation to help protect the insurance fund from losses caused bythe diminution of capital by those insured institutions that have not reachedtheir fully phased-in capital levels, particularly those undercapitalizedthrifts that are paying dividends inconsistent with their capital, netincome and risk to the deposit insurance fund.  At the same time, however, the Board wishes to leave ample management discretionwith respect to capital distributions for institutions meeting or exceedingtheir fully phased-in capital requirements and not posing significant supervisoryproblems. The Board believes that this safe-harbor approach is logicalin light of the reasonable dividend payment records of most insured institutionsand the fact that the approach advances the Board's policy of increasingthe capital levels of insured institutions. <T3>See </T3>Bard Res. No. 88-1342 (December 15, 1988), 53 FR 51800 (December23, 1988).  <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Proposal  </ITAG>The Board seeks to exercise the greatest supervisory control over thoseinstitutions that are below their regulatory capital requirements becauseof the potential effect of actions taken by such institutions on theirsafe and sound operation and the increased risk of loss that such institutionspose to the FSLIC. The Board is also concerned about the ability of insuredinstitutions that are between their minimum and fully phased-in capitalrequirements to meet expeditiously their fully phased-in capital requirements.Capital distributions by institutions not meeting their fully phased-incapital requirements retard the attainment of this goal.  The Board, on the other hand, seeks to give greater management discretionto institutions meeting or exceeding their fully phased-in capital requirementsand not posing significant supervisory problems. Thus, the Board is proposinga tiered approach to capital distributions,\4\<NOTE/> based on the soundness of an institution's capitalizationand the safety of its operation.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\In brief, the Board considers the following transactions,as defined in the proposed regulation, to be capital distributions subjectto the tiered approach. First, all non-stock dividends on and repurchasesof an institution's common or preferred stock, are defined as capital distributions,as are repurchases of options, warrants, and other rights for the purchaseof or conversion into such stock. All of these transactions entail thepayout of an institution's capital to its shareholders or to those investorswith entitlements to become shareholders. The term capital distributionalso encompasses cashout mergers, as defined above, because they causethe acquiring or resulting institution to have a lower capital-to-assetsratio on a <T3>pro forma </T3>basis than the acquiring insitutions had before givingeffect to the tranaction. Finally, the Corporation would be authorizedto find that other transactions involving the payout of capital by an institutionare capital distributions to be subject to this regulation.  This proposed regulation establishes three tiers of insured instiutions.Tier 2 and tier 3 institutions, however, will be treated similarly, butnot identically, in their ability to make capital distributions. The threetiers are: (1) Tier 1, an insured institution that has net capital exceedingthis fully phased-in capital requirement under 12 CFR 563.13, 563.14 and563.14-1 as reported on its quarterly reports to the Board and that israted in one of the top two categories of the MACRO system; (2) tier 2,an insured institution with either (a) net capital above its regulatorycapital requirements under andSection;andSection;563.13, 563.14 and 563.14-1,but below its fully phased-in capital requirements, or (b) net capitalthat would qualify it for tier 1, but that is not rated in one of the toptwo categories of the MACRO system and (3) tier 3, an insured institutionwith net capital below the amount of its regulatory capital requirement.     An institution is considered to be in a lower tier, such as tier 2 insteadof tier 1, if its capital would fall into the lower tier either immediatelyprior to, or on a <T3>pro forma </T3>basis after giving effect to, a proposed capital distribution.The percentage by which a tier 1 institution's net capital-to-assets ratioexceeds the ratio of its fully phased-in capital requirement to its assetsis referred to as its ``surplus capital ratio''. <T3>A. Tier 1 Institutions </T3>A tier 1 institution would have the greatest discretion to make capitaldistributions. A tier 1 institution would be permitted (without application)to make aggregate capital distributions during a calendar year up to theamount that would reduce its surplus capital ratio below one-half of itssurplus capital ratio at the beginning of the calendar year, as adjustedto reflect its net income to date during the calendar year. If the institutionwishes to make capital distributions in an amount above the ``safe-harbor''standard, it must receive approval in advance from the Board. The Board has specifically determined that earnings over a calendar yearshould logically be regarded as ``instantaneous capital''. As such, a tier1 institution's capital distributions during a calendar year are limitedto the amount that would reduce by one-half its surplus capital ratio atthe beginning of a calendar year as adjusted to reflect its net incomefor the calendar year to date. This amount is calculated by computing 50percent of a ratio with a numerator equal to the sum of the institution'ssurplus capital at the beginning of the calendar year plus its net incometo date for the year and a denominator equal to the institution's totalassets on the date of the proposed capital distribution. This regulationdoes not prohibit a tier 1 institution's net capital from falling belowthis level but does prohibit capital distributions by a tier 1 institutionif its net capital is below this level immediately prior to the capitaldistribution or to the extent that it would fall below that level on a<T3>pro forma </T3>basis after a proposed capital distribution. For example, if at the beginning of a calendar year, a $100 million assetinstitution has net capital of $10 million (10 percent of assets) and afully phased-in capital requirement of $6 million (6 percent of assets),it would have surplus capital of $4 million and a surplus capital ratioof 4 percent of assets. Assume its fully phased-in capital requirementremained constant. Also assume that the institution had earnings of $1million during the calendar year, thereby increasing its net capital to$11 million (11 percent of assets). This institution's surplus capitalratio at the end of the calendar year would not be permitted to be below8.5 percent of assets, a reduction of 50 percent of its initial surpluscapital ratio of 4 percent (2 percent or $2 million) plus 50 percent ofits additional 1 percent ($1 million) from earnings ($500,000). Therefore,this institution could make capital distributions up to $2.5 million duringthe calendar year without application. With regard to such tier 1 institutions, the Board's goal is to guard againstrapid decreases in their capital levels, while enabling owners of tier1 institutions to redeploy the institutions' surplus capital as long asthe institutions remain soundly capitalized. Because accounting informationis imperfect and net worth levels can be subject to rapid swings, the Boardbelieves that the proposed limit of one-half of tier 1 institutions' surpluscapital ratios is a conservative and prudent means to protect the safetyand soundness of insured institutions. Subjecting current year earningsto the same 50 percent standard applicable to surplus capital reinforcesthe safeguards of the proposed payout limit during a calendar year of one-halfof a tier 1 institution's surplus capital without application, althoughthe Board recognizes that such a rule imposes higher <T3>de facto </T3>minimum capital standards on institutions with higherearnings unless approval is received to drop below this regulatory floor.<T3>B. Tier 2 Institutions </T3>Institutions that qualify as tier 2 institutions on either a current or<T3>pro forma </T3>basis would generally not be authorized to make capitaldistributions except upon application. The proposed regulation adopts aformal application procedure for relief from the regulatory requirementsfor tier 2 institutions. It will allow supervisory personnel to approvethe making of capital distributions by tier 2 institutions, when appropriate,according to Board delegations of authority and guidelines promulgatedby the Office of Regulatory Activities on behalf of the Board. In theseguidelines, supervisory personnel will be directed to look favorably uponapplications for approval to pay dividends by tier 2 institutions thatare making new issuances of stock to raise their capital levels and thatare making significant and rapid progress toward meeting their fully phased-incapital requirements. The guidelines would also direct supervisory staffon the appropriated supervisory action to take for violations of this regulation.In proposing this general limitation on capital distributions by tier 2institutions, the Board seeks to encourage these insured institutions tobuild their capital levels through the retention of earnings as well asthrough securities issuances in the capital markets, while simultaneouslyadopting an applications process to provide relief in appropriate circumstances.The Board also is providing an incentive through the tiered system in thisand other regulations for such insured institutions to attain compliancewith their fully phased-in capital requirements prior to the required compliancedates under the Board's regulations. All insured institutions must file either an application or a notice withtheir Principal Supervisory Agents (``PSAs'') prior to making capital distributions.First, all insured institution subsidiaries of savings and loan holdingcompanies must comply with the statutorily required notice provisions ofandSection; 584.5 prior to paying dividends. Second, all tier 1 institutionsmust provide written notice to their PSAs ten days prior to the makingof capital distributions. This notice requirement is satisfied by compliancewith andSection; 584.5. Finally, the notice of requirements under andSection;584.5 may be satisfied by the filing of applications required for capitaldistributions by tier 1 or tier 2 institutions, if filed 30 calendar daysbefore making the proposed capital distribution. C. Tier 3 InstitutionsAn institution that qualifies as a tier 3 institution either immediatelyprior to or after making a capital distribution is not authorized to makecapital distributions. Exceptions to this policy will not be granted withinthe confines of the proposed regulation.The Board firmly believes that it is imperative to prohibit the distributionof capital to shareholders by tier 3 institutions that do not satisfy eventheir minimum regulatory capital requirements. Protection of the safetyand soundness of such institutions, their depositors, and the FSLIC demandsthat tier 3 institutions preserve any existing capital and dedicate anyearnings to building their capital.The requirements of the proposal, when finalized, will be generally applicableto all insured institutions, including those with current outstanding dividendlimitation agreements. These new regulatory requirements will also supplantany forbearances previously granted with regard to dividend payments orother capital distributions. Insured institutions initially will be subjectto the more restrictive set of restraints under either their existing dividendagreement or the requirements of the regulation. Institutions under a stricteragreement than the new regulatory requirements, however, may apply to theirPSAs to substitute the proposed regulatory standards. These requests willgenerally be favorably considered barring special supervisory circumstances.The Board expressly seeks comment on this aspect of the proposal.This proposal's thresholds for capital distributions are keyed to whetherinsured institutions have net capital equal to their minimum regulatorycapital requirements or fully phased-in capital requirements under 12 CFR563.13, 563.14, and 563.14-1. The proposal is intended to adapt to anyfuture changes to these regulatory requirements, including but not limitedto the adoption of risk-based capital regulations currently being consideredby the Board and other federal banking agencies and any capital requirementsimposed by the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and EnforcementAct of 1989. <T3>See </T3>S 413, 101st Cong., 1st Session, 135 Cong. Rec. 5113; S 577,101st Cong., 1st Session, 135 Cong. Rec. S4304; HR 1278, 101st Cong., 1stSession, 135 Cong. Rec. H2602 (1989). (``FIRREA'').Accordingly, references in this proposal to the terms regulatory capital,regulatory capital requirement and fully phased-in capital requirementrelate to the current regulations (andSection;andSection; 561.13, 563.13 and563.14) and to any successor to these regulations. These terms refer tocurrent or prospective regulations and relate to the Board's policies onthe minimum permissible amount of capital during a transition period (``minimumcapital requirement'') and attainment by an institution of full capitalizationat the end of a transition period (``fully phased-in capital requirement'').The Board also believes that this tiered approach should be used as a guidefor various types of corporate restructurings and reorganizations. Onesuch use would be in establishing the amount of proceeds from a mutualto stock conversion by an insured institution that its holding companywould be permitted to retain. The amount would depend upon the capitaltier into which the institution falls on a <T3>pro forma </T3>basis. Because such a transaction is the economic equivalentof the institution receiving all of the proceeds and then paying a dividendto the holding company, the amount of proceeds retained by the holdingcompany would be aggregated with the insured institution's other capitaldistributions subject to the ceiling for the institution's capital tier.Another transaction that would be appropriate to treat as a capital distributionis the capitalization of a holding company in a reorganization. Under thestandards of this proposal, the amount of capital infused into the newlyformed holding company by the insured institution would be aggregated withother capital distributions for the period and would be limited by applicationof the tiered ceilings.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Solicitation of Comment on Specific Issues</ITAG>The Board, in addition to seeking comment on the entire proposal, expresslyseeks comment on specific alternative provisions of the regulation thatthe Board may adopt in the final regulation.First, although the Board has determined not to explicitly address growthissues in this proposed regulation, there is a strong argument for doingso. Both growth and capital distributions can involve ``capital dissipation''and, as such, effectively reduce an insured institution's capital ratio.There is no substantive economic difference between a cash-out merger (fullyaddressed in the proposal) and asset/liability growth of an equivalentamount in terms of the increase in the leverage of the resulting institution.The Board recognizes, however, that the existing regulatory and supervisorypolicies on growth, restricting the growth of insolvent and troubled institutions,as well as requiring sufficient capitalization of all new growth, addressmany of the supervisory difficulties that the Board has experienced inthe past with regard to rapid growth. Furthermore, FIRREA is expected toprovide the Board with an explicit statutory mandate and authority to restrictthe growth of any insured savings association that is not meeting applicableregulatory capital requirements. The Board's successor agency will needto implement this authority in a comprehensive regulatory fashion, whichcannot be done at this time because the legislation has not been finalized.Because of the many issues that will arise in the context of amending theBoard's growth regulations and policies and the desire of the Board tokeep this proposal simple in order to issue it in an expeditious manner,the Board is not proposing to address growth issues at this time. The Board,however, expects to incorporate growth in a consistent fashion with thisproposed policy after FIRREA becomes law and requests comment on the appropriateregulatory interrelationship between growth and capital distributions inthe post-FIRREA era.Second, the Board solicits comment on what other types of capital distributionsshould or should not be encompassed under the same approach, either explicitlyin this regulation or by providing the discretion for the Board or itsdesignee to make a subsequent finding that an activity constitutes a capitaldistribution that should be subject to this regulation. The Board alsospecifically seeks comment on whether contributions to employee stock ownershipplans, because of their potential effect on institutions' capital and thedistribution to the employees, officers, and directors of insured institutions'capital, warrant separate express treatment under this proposed regulation.Third, the Board also seeks comment on whether preferred stock dividendsshould be treated differently under this proposed rule, particularly inlight of insured institutions' commitments to pay dividends and to accumulateunpaid dividends on existing classes of preferred. If insured institutionswere unable because of this proposed rule to pay preferred stock dividends,to what extent would this require insured institutions to violate the termsof their issued preferred stock and expose such institutions to liabilityor immediate acceleration? Also, would such action generate undue concernand negative market perceptions resulting in impairment of such institutions'market access? These matters present significant problems and the Boardasks for comment on the appropriate method of dealing with these issuesin its final rule.Finally, from a supervisory standpoint, the Board seeks comment on whetherthere is any need for supervisory concern if tier 1 institutions that makecapital distributions early in a calendar year subsequently suffer lossesduring the calendar year that causes their net capital to fall below one-halfof their surplus capital ratio at the beginning of the calendar year plusone-half of their earnings during the calendar year. The proposal doesnot expressly prohibit a tier 1 institution's net capital from fallingbelow one-half of its surplus capital ratio at the beginning of the period(plus one-half of earnings year-to-date), but does prohibit further capitaldistributions if the institution's net capital is at or below this levelon a current or <T3>pro forma </T3>basis. Should the Board, however, require institutionsto wait until later in a calendar year to make capital distributions oronly permit capital distributions early in a calendar year deemed by theinsured institution to be consistent with their projections of net income/lossesduring the coming year?<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Solicitation of Comment on Alternative Approaches</ITAG>In addition to seeking comment on specific aspects of this proposal, theBoard also requests commenters to address the merits of adopting alternativeapproaches to this proposal. One such alternative has been used previouslyin imposing conditions to the approval of certain holding company applications.This option utilizes a sliding-scale approach based on an institution'scapital instead of the tiered approach herein proposed.Under one form of sliding-scale system, an institution would be allowedto declare and pay dividends up to 50 percent of its net income for anyquarter if the institution has regulatory capital at least equal to itsregulatory capital requirement. If the institution's regulatory capitalis greater than or equal to its fully phased-in regulatory capital requirementand its GAAP capital is greater than or equal to 6 percent of total liabilities,the institution would be permitted to declare and pay dividends up to 75percent of its net income for any quarter. If the institution's regulatorycapital is greater than or equal to its fully phased-in regulatory capitalrequirement plus 2 percent of total liabilities and its GAAP capital isgreater than or equal to 6 percent of total liabilities, then the institutionwould be permitted to declare and pay dividends up to 90 percent of itsnet income for any quarter.The ability to declare and pay dividends under the foregoing approach wouldbe subject to a ``rolling'' four-quarter period test of dividends paidand net income. Dividends declared and paid in any quarter would not onlybe limited to the net income of the quarter but would be aggregated withthe dividends and net income from the three immediately preceding quarters.In no event would the institution be permited to declare and pay dividendsthat would reduce its capital below its minimum regulatory capital requirement.The Board requests comment on whether adoption of such a sliding scaleapproach applied to all capital distributions would provide greater protectionto the FSLIC and would provide greater enhancement of the safe and soundoperation of insured institutions than the tiered approach proposed herein.Another alternative to the proposal would make further distinctions betweenthe limitations on capital distributions for tier 2 and tier 3 institutions.For example, a tier 2 institution could be allowed to make aggregate capitaldistributions during any calendar year up to 50 percent of its net incomefor the calendar year without application. (This standard, if adopted,would also be available as an alternative for tier 1 institutions.) TheBoard could also permit tier 2 institutions to pay dividends on new classesof stock issued by the institution to raise capital without having to submitan application. Since the Board is unclear on the best method of implementingthis option, if adopted, (<T3>i.e.</T3>, Class B common stock, special classes of preferred), itrequests comment on the optimal approach. Finally, under either of thesealternatives, institutions qualifying as tier 3 institutions on eithera current or <T3>pro forma</T3> basis would still generally be prohibited from makingcapital distributions, but could be authorized to make such capital distributionsin rare instances upon receiving supervisory approval of their waiver applications.The Board is also considering options eliminating either the 50% of netincome restriction or all restrictions on capital distributions by tier1 institutions that are in compliance with their fully phased-in requirementsimmediately prior to and after the proposed capital distributions. TheBoard strongly urges all interested persons to comment on the foregoingspecific provisions and alternative approaches.<ITAG tagnum="81">Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis</ITAG>Pursuant to Section 3 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 603,the Board is providing the following initial regulatory flexibility analysis:1. <T3>Reasons, objectives and legal basis underlying the proposed rule. </T3>Theseelements are incorporated above in <T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION</T2>.2. <T3>Small institutions to which the proposed rule would apply. </T3>TheSmall Business Administration defines a small financial institution as``a commercial bank or savings and loan association, the assets which,for the preceding fiscal year, do not exceed $100 million.'' 13 CFR 121.13(a)(1988).Therefore, small entities to which the proposed rule applies are the 1,651insured institutions that had assets totaling $100 million or less as ofDecember 31, 1987.3. <T3>Impact of the proposed rule on small entities. </T3>The proposed rulewould not have a substantial impact on small insured institutions and wouldapply uniformly to all insured institutions.The rule would not impose any unnecessary financial, recordkeeping or administrativeburden on small insured institutions.4. <T3>Overlapping or conflicting federal rules. </T3>There are no known federalrules that duplicate, overlap, or conflict with this proposal.5. <T3>Alternatives to the proposed rule. </T3>The Board is not aware of anyalternatives that would be less burdensome than the proposed rule in addressingthe concerns expressed in the <T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION</T2> set forth above. The Board, however,specifically requests comment on appropriate alternatives to this proposedrule.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 563 and 563b</ITAG>Bank deposit insurance, Currency, Investments, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements, Savings and loan associations, Securities.Accordingly, the Board hereby proposes to amend parts 563 and 563b, SubchapterD, Chapter V, Title 12, Code of Federal Regulations, as set forth below:<ITAG tagnum="72">SUBCHAPTER D_FEDERAL SAVINGS AND LOAN INSURANCE CORPORATION</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">PART 563_OPERATIONS</ITAG>1.
