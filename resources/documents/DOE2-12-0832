Wind power will provide the lion'sshare of it in the low scenario as well as in the middle and high scenarios.For the high scenario even 3000 MW is expected in the year 2010. In thisarticle on estimation the cost price development until 2010 is made forwind power, hydro energy, solar energy, and geothermal energy, takinginto consideration a price decrease as a result of technical developmentsand mass production. Then it is determined which technical-economicalpotential can be realized in every scenario, in competition with energyfrom traditional sources. For energy out of waste material, the amountof waste, available in the coming years, was estimated, taking into accountthe increase of recycling. 2 figs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
