TATRO</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The cozy relationship between private armssellers and the Defense Ministry is at the heart of a debate overthe need for controls on arms merchants and Israeli officers whoreportedly trained hitmen for Colombian drug lords.   ``Israel is a small country. Everybody who was a colonel orbrigadier general in the army has very intimate contacts with thedefense establishment,'' said Ehud Olmert, minister of Arab affairsin the Cabinet and a right-wing Likud bloc member.   ``The question is what is the involvement of the defenseministry? It is one of the questions that will be investigated,''Olmert said.   The left-leaning daily Davar newspaper in an editorial said itwas ``inconceivable that the security establishment didn't know whatwas going on in Colombia.''   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, however, told reporters theministry did not learn of the training until April when it issued awritten warning to the company involved.   ``There are those who are not obeying the law. But I believe thenumber of people who have not obeyed the law ... is very, verylimited. Israeli mercenaries are basically non-existent,'' Rabinsaid.   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, once a senior official in theMossad intelligence service, promised a thorough investigation butexpressed skepticism about whether Israelis knowingly helped druggangs.   ``I know our officers, and I cannot believe that they would havebeen involved in such crimes,'' Shamir said.   Conservatives in Parliament's Law Committee blocked a move byliberals to tighten existing controls that make it a crimepunishable by six months in jail for a reservist to sell weapons orgive training without authorization.   Urging more control, Labor Party lawmaker David Libai said onIsrael radio: ``It cannot be that we train people to kill in thearmy for the sake of our country, and that later people use it fortheir own personal profit without any control.''   However, Eli Landau, mayor of the Tel Aviv suburb Herzlia,defended the reservists accused of helping drug kingpins. ``With awave of their hands, they forgot the 20 years in which you and yourfriends risked your lives for us all,'' he wrote in an ad in Israelinewspapers.   Industry Minister Ariel Sharon, former defense minister andgeneral, criticized the debate over the Colombian affair.   ``There is certainly not one man among us who would want to seeIsraelis linked to drug deals. But nothing has been proven. Nobodyhas been tried. We with our own hands are turning Israel into theone responsible for drugs in Colombia,'' Sharon said today.   ``We are talking about our army officers. We are talking aboutpeople who risked their lives for years, who served the army's bestunits. What has been proven about them to this day is that they arefirst-rate fighters. Nothing else,'' Sharon added.   The close-knit nature of the relationship between officialdom andprivate arms merchants shows up in the ``Israel Defense SalesDirectory.'' The ministry's annual catalogue lists government armsmakers side-by-side with private companies that arrange sales ofweapons or services.   Among the companies is Hod HaHanit (Spearhead), which describesitself as ``specializing in fighting terrorism by establishing andtraining anti-terror units, internal security and intelligenceforces ... presidential guard units and VIP security.''   The company is headed by reserve Lt. Col. Yair Klein, whoassociates say was once an instructor in a parachute course headedby Dan Shomron, now Israel's chief of staff.   Former commander of an elite anti-terror unit, Klein is the focusof a police probe of the Colombia affair in which six formerofficers have been questioned so far.   At one point, Klein threatened to blow the whistle on otherhigh-ranking officers and at least one member of parliament who hesugggested were involved in unauthorized arms dealings in LatinAmerica.   Two right-wing members of parliament, Yehoshua Saguy and RehavamZeevi, said they had been in Colombia on arms-related business butonly with government authorization.   Yoram Perry, a military historian and journalist, said in aninterview that the Colombia affair was an outgrowth of too close arelationship between those still in uniform and their retired armybuddies.   ``The crux of the issue is the social relationship between thosewho are now in power and those who do a job overseas. They arefriends. They say, `I know this guy. He's not going to deal insomething to do with narcotics.' So they believe there is no need toformalize ways of control,'' Perry said.   Many Israelis, especially conservatives, argue that Israel wasonly marketing skills it had honed in repeated wars with the Arabs.   ``It's a central fact that Israel has something that peoplewant,'' Zeev Chafets, a former Government Press Office director,said in an interview.   ``It's no more exceptional than people who want to buy Saudi oilor Swiss watches. It just happens to be what we've got to export.''   Israel's arms exports have totaled more than $1 billion since themid-1980s. A reported $350 million in Kfir warplanes, Galil rifles,communications equipment and other hardware has gone to Colombia thepast decade.</TEXT></DOC>
