Flies Into Video Stores With Record Orders</HEAD><BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   ``E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial'' soared into thestratosphere Thursday, the first day of the movie's release onvideocassette.   ``Nobody's buying just one,'' said Gail Boswell, manager of TowerVideo. ``I had one customer come in and buy 120 cassettes. Othersare buying two or three or four.''   Demand has been so great that MCA Home Video, the video'spackager, has been unable to fill orders. Some retailers willreceive only 75 percent of their requests.   Boswell said she ordered 2,500 cassettes, expected 1,700 butreceived only 1,200.   In any case, MCA Home Video, a subsidiary of MCA Inc., couldenjoy revenues of close to $200 million from the ``E.T.'' sales.   There are more than 11 million advance orders for the $24.95video. Pepsi Cola is sponsoring a $5 ``E.T.'' rebate offer, and willpromote the video in a $25 million advertising campaign. There is noPepsi commercial on the video itself.   Most movies are released within six months of their opening inmovie theaters. ``E.T.,'' released in 1982, has never been shown onbroadcast or cable television.   The video release of the movie was delayed because StevenSpielberg, the film's director and producer, told Universal severalyears ago that he wanted the cassettes to be affordable.   The previous low price for a major video release was last year's``Top Gun,'' which sold for $26.95. About 3 million ``Top Gun''cassettes were bought. ``Cinderella,'' which has sold more than 5million copies in the last month, is priced at $26.99.</TEXT></DOC>
