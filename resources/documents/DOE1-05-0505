The 32 casesof normal subjects and the 13 cases of patients with mandibular diseasesof ameloblastoma, primordial cysts, squamous cell carcinoma and odontomawere analyzed by their intra-oral radiographs in the right premolar regions.The radiograms were digitized by the use of a drum scanner densitometrymethod. The input radiographic images were processed by a histogram equalizationmethod. The result are as follows : First, the histogram equalizationmethod enhances the image contrast of the textures. Second, the outputimages of the textures for normal mandible-trabeculae radiograms areof network pattern in nature. Third, the output images for the patientsare characterized by the non-network pattern and replaced by the patternsof the fabric texture, intertwined plants (karakusa-pattern), scatteredsmall masses and amorphous texture. Thus, these results indicates thatthe present digital image system is expected to be useful for revealingthe texture patterns of the radiographs and in the future for the textureanalysis of the clinical radiographs to obtain quantitative diagnosticfindings.</TEXT></DOC>
