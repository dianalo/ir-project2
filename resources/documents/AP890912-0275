Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, whose committee is expected to writea tax bill later this month, said his plan also would allowpenalty-free withdrawals from IRAs to buy a first home or finance acollege education.   Bentsen, who has been a consistent supporter of a capital-gainstax cut, said the federal deficit is too big to allow both such areduction, which President Bush has recommended, and expanded IRAs.   ``We must make a choice (of which will do more to encouragesaving) and I am convinced that my IRA deserves priority,'' Bentsentold a news conference. ``Cutting capital gains (taxes) is aninvestment incentive for a few but the problem is broader than that.With the IRA, we'd have the participation of a broad spectrum ofMiddle America.''   Bentsen made his proposal public an hour before the House Waysand Means Committee resumed consideration of a capital-gainsreduction. He said it had been warmly received by the SenateDemocratic Caucus and by Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine.   A Bush-backed capital-gains cut has a one-vote majority on theHouse panel, but Democratic leaders have postponed considerationseveral times in an effort to turn around at least one of the sixDemocrats who favor the reduction.   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of Ways and Means, foundlittle support among fellow Democrats for his latest attempt at acapital-gains compromise, although several Republicans seemedwilling to accept it. The proposal would protect capital gainsagainst inflation and provide a special break for long-term holdersof assets.   The panel put off further consideration until Wednesday.   Capital gains, which are profits from the sale of stock and otherassets, are taxed at the same rate as other income, ranging up to 33percent. The compromise bill that Bush backs, sponsored chiefly byReps. Ed Jenkins, D-Ga., and Bill Archer, R-Texas, would cut the toprate to 19.6 percent for 2{ years. The top rate then would rise to28 percent. Investors would be protected against having to pay taxeson profits generated by inflation.   There is general agreement that the proposal would increase taxcollections for a year by encouraging investors to sell long-heldassets. After that, Democrats say, it would cut tax collections.Bush insists it would raise money in the long run.   The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that the Jenkinscapital-gains cut would cost about $5 billion in lost revenue in1994, while Bentsen's IRA plan would cost $4 billion.   ``IRA affects average folks,'' Bentsen said. ``It helps addressthree of the primary concerns of middle-income Americans,lower-income Americans: buying that first home, financing a collegeeducation and providing for one's retirement.''   Under his proposal, a person could contribute up to $2,000 a yearto an IRA and avoid current taxation on half the sum. Thecontribution and the interest earned would not be taxed until themoney was withdrawn for retirement, tuition or making the downpayment on a first home.   Since passage of the 1986 tax overhaul, fully deductible IRAshave been available only to workers not covered by a company pensionand to single people earning less than $25,000 and couples under$40,000.   In 1986, when deductible IRAs were available to all workers,nearly $38 billion was contributed to such accounts. Almost 15percent of all taxpayers claimed an IRA deduction. Those figureshave dropped significantly since that time.   When deductible IRAs were scaled back, they were criticized asrewarding people who would save anyway, and as encouraging thetransfer of savings from taxable accounts into IRAs.   However, Bentsen said a new study commissioned by Merrill LynchConsumer Markets disputes those points. That study concluded that 80percent of IRA contributions were new savings.</TEXT></DOC>
