(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   More than 1,000 anti-nuclear protesterswere arrested at the nation's nuclear testing grounds Saturday aspart of the annual ``Reclaim the Test Site'' demonstration.   Energy Department spokesman Jim Boyer estimated that 1,500people turned out Saturday for the ninth day of the protest at theNevada Test Site. The event ends Sunday.   Boyer said 1,060 protesters were arrested, mostly on misdemeanortrespass charges.   They were taken by bus to the Nye County Sheriff's office inBeatty, 55 miles away, where they were to be released after beingcited on the misdemeanor charge, Boyer said.   ``Because of the numbers, we just decided to put securitypersonnel on the buses so they can write the citations while thebuses are rolling,'' Boyer said. ``The same ones that were arrestedyesterday are the ones we are taking out there there today.''   County officials announced earlier this month they would nolonger prosecute the trespassers because of the growing number ofprotests and arrests at the remote desert site.   A total of 2,818 arrests were reported at the site last year,including 2,065 during the 1988 ``Reclaim the Test Site'' action.   More than 100 law officers were on hand to collect and handcuffthe demonstrators as they walked across a cattle guard raised onthe main road leading to the test site.   The cattle guard, consisting of slats placed across the road,has been a rallying point for protests the past eight years, andlaw officers have arrested activists who crossed that point ontotest site property.   Hundreds of protesters slipped through barbed wire fencessurrounding a section of the site, then waited on the sun baked,windswept desert for officers to arrest them.   Sensitive areas of the test site, where nuclear tests areconducted, are remote and highly guarded.</TEXT></DOC>
