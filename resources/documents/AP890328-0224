The Japanese government is currently embroiled in a stockscandal of its own that has implicated government officials and isputting pressure on Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita.   Giuliani, whose office brought about 50 securities fraudindictments in his term that ended in January, said he wascontacted by private attorneys in Japan and will lecture toofficials in Tokyo April 13-14.   ``I think it's very, very important for the United States thatin other countries that are part of the world market that we have asimilar set of rules,'' he said. ``Otherwise we're at a competitivedisadvantage.''   Giuliani, a possible New York mayoral candidate now in privatepractice, said he will meet with more than 10 Japanese investmentfirms and U.S. firms with offices there, as well as governmentagencies, securities officials and law enforcement organizations.He said he will discuss U.S. insider trading and other securitiesfraud laws and cases.   Japan, home to the world's biggest stock market, modeled itspostwar laws on securities fraud after those in the United Statesbut rarely enforced them. Markets in some European countries andHong Kong are loosely regulated, and insider trading and otherfinancial scandals recently hit France and Mexico.   ``Many of them have statutes and laws, some similar to ours,some a little different,'' Giuliani said.   ``The major problem they're undergoing is the same problem wewere undergoing in the '40s, '50s and '60s _ not enforcing them,not knowing how to enforce them and not having educated theinstitutions on the importance of the rules,'' he said.   The current scandal in Japan involves the sale of thousands ofshares of unlisted stock by the Recruit Co. to politicians andother prominent people at bargain prices. The buyers reapedwindfalls when the shares were publicly traded later.   At least 17 senior politicians, including Takeshita and formerPrime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, have been linked to the scandal.</TEXT></DOC>
