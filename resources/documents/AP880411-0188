The gunmen said the dead man was a ``Kuwaiti officer.'' He wasthe second Kuwaiti military man slain by the hijackers during theweeklong ordeal aboard the Kuwait Airways jet.   The hijackers have demanded that Kuwait release 17 pro-Iranianterrorists convicted in 1984 for bombings at the U.S. and Frenchembassies.   Sources close to the negotiations said, however, that thehijackers demanded freedom Monday only for the three men among the17 who have been sentenced to death. Kuwait has rejected all of thegunmen's demands.   In Kuwait, Foreign Minister Sheik Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah saidhis country is prepared to lose more hostages rather than give into terrorism.   ``We will try our utmost to protect our dear ones aboard theplane, but we will not surrender to any blackmail, even if we losemore of them,'' he told a news conference. ``This is not thedecision of Kuwait's government. It is a decision of the people.''   There are 52 people aboard the Boeing 747, including threemembers of Kuwait's extensive royal family and the hijackers, whoare wearing blue hoods and armed with grenades and handguns.   Sabah said there are at least eight hijackers, all of themArabs, carrying forged passports from Bahrain, Iraq and Colombia.   He was asked if the jet would be attacked and said, ``Thedecision to storm is not ours. It lies with the Cypriot government,on whose land the plane stands.''   The man killed Monday was pushed from the blue-and-white planeat 3:07 p.m. (8:07 a.m. EDT) after Cypriot officials ignored twodeadlines to refuel the jet.   Doctors at Larnaca morgue said he had suffered injuries to theside of his face, apparently from a beating. They said he had beenshot twice in the head at close range before his body, hands boundbehind his back, was thrown onto the tarmac at Larnaca Airport.   ``We have executed a Kuwaiti officer,'' a hijacker told thecontrol tower. ``We also reconfirm that the craft must be refueledimmediately, immediately, before we take more dangerous steps.''   At dusk, the hijackers put one of the passengers, identified asFadl Marzouk el-Oteibi, on the radio.   Speaking in Arabic, he told the control tower: ``The hijackerssay that if you don't give us fuel they will kill all thepassengers. Please listen to this and greetings to my family.''   The hijackers said they wanted about nine hours' worth of fuelso they could fly to an unspecified ``neutral country.''   On Saturday, the hijackers killed their first victim, a24-year-old Kuwaiti border guard.   They set the first deadline for refueling Monday at 1 p.m. (6a.m. EDT) and warned that ``we will kill a personality related tothe unjust Kuwaiti regime.''   The members of the royal family on the plane are businesmanFadel Khaled al-Sabah and his sisters Ebtesam and Anware.   The first deadline passed without incident after Malaz Abdo,deputy director of the Palestine Liberation Organization's officein Nicosia, and a Cypriot official negotiated with the hijackers.   The hijackers then set a 2:30 p.m. (7:30 a.m. EDT) deadline andtold the tower that refueling must start or ``you'll receive thecorpse.'' Forty-seven minutes later, the body was thrown out.   On Sunday, a pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem faction in Lebanonthreatened to kill American and French hostages it holds if anyattempt is made to storm the plane.   Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, made the threat in astatement delivered to the Reuters news agency in Beirut along withphotographs of American Terry Anderson and Frenchman Jean-PaulKauffmann, both journalists kidnapped in 1985.   Anderson, 40, is the chief Middle East correspondent of TheAssociated Press. Islamic Jihad also holds Thomas Sutherland, 55.   Kidnappers of another American, Marine Lt. Col. William R.Higgins, theatened on Monday to hang him.   A communique issued in Beirut by the pro-Iranian Organization ofthe Oppressed on Earth said: ``We shall put the American agent Col.William Higgins on the gallows if anyone attempts to attack theplane.'' No photo accompanied the communique.   Higgins, 43, of Danville, Ky., served with a U.N. observer groupin southern Lebanon and was kidnapped on Feb. 17.   Kuwait Airways Flight 422 was hijacked April 5 with 112 peopleaboard as it flew from from Bangkok to Kuwait. It was forced downin Mashhad, Iran, where 57 people were freed.   The plane left Iran on Friday after refueling. Lebanon and Syriarefused to let it touch down at their airports and it landed atLarnaca after the pilot radioed that he was running out of fuel.   Another captive, an ailing 32-year-old Kuwaiti, was freed inLarnaca Saturday.   The hijackers' reference to a ``neutral country'' Monday was thefirst time since landing at Larnaca that they have given anyinkling of where they want to fly if they get fuel. They did notname a country.   But Kuwait's Al-Qabas daily reported that Algerian officialshave become involved in the negotiations.   On Sunday, the hijackers threatened to take off and force thepilot to crash the jet into the emir's palace in Kuwait City.   In Washington, the Reagan administration expressed support forthe Cypriot refusal to refuel the plane.</TEXT></DOC>
