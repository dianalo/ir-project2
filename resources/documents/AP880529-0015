A communique released Saturday by the Khmer Rouge militarycommand said Hanoi actually was shifting its troops around Cambodiain a frantic attempt to counter escalating guerrilla attacks.   Vietnam, which invaded Cambodia in late 1978, is fighting acoalition of three resistance groups including the communist KhmerRouge. On Thursday, it announced a partial pullout of 50,000 troopsto be followed by a total withdrawal in 1990.   Vietnam says it has made annual withdrawals since 1982, but theUnited States says the only genuine pullout was in November, when20,000 troops were withdrawn.   The United States estimates Vietnam still has 120,000 to 125,000troops in Cambodia and says the other troop movements were onlyrotations.   Vietnam and the pro-Hanoi regime in Cambodia said bettersecurity in the country made possible the Vietnamese reductionscheduled to begin next month.   But the Khmer Rouge communique, broadcast over the clandestineKhmer Rouge radio, said Vietnam this month has been ``moving troopsback and forth from one battlefield to another aimlessly like afrightened monkey'' to withstand guerrilla strikes. It called theclaim ``stinking and deceitful.''   ``There is no sign that the Vietnamese enemy is preparing towithdraw 50,000 troops from Cambodia,'' the communique said. ``Thisis more shameless propaganda to deceive world public opinion.''   The communique cited details of what it claimed to be Vietnamesetroop movements in recent months.   Western analysts regard Khmer Rouge claims with suspicion andmost are not verified by independent sources.   On Saturday, China also said the Vietnamese claims of troopwithdrawal were deceptive.   The Khmer Rouge is the most powerful of three rebel groups in acoalition led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk. Announcements of theVietnamese withdrawal have sparked some fears that the Khmer Rougecould return to power.   The Khmer Rouge ruled Cambodia from 1975 until the Vietnameseinvasion. Millions of Cambodians were killed or died of starvationor disease in the regime's attempt to impose radical agrariancommunism.</TEXT></DOC>
