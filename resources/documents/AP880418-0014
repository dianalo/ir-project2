JOHN'S, Newfoundland (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   France recalled its ambassadorto Canada on Sunday after 21 French nationals were arrested forillegally fishing in Canadian waters.   The French citizens, who had been protesting a fishing ban onFrench trawlers when they were arrested on Thursday, were releasedfrom jail on Sunday following a bail hearing.   The French foreign ministry said the decision to recallAmbassador Philippe Husson to Paris was taken because of a``worsening of the French-Canadian dispute over fishing.''   The trawler the fishermen were on was based in St.Pierre-Miquelon, a group of small French-held islands south ofNewfoundland.   The islanders have been banned from their traditional fishinggrounds in the Gulf of St. Lawrence because of a dispute betweenCanada and France over the size of the fishing boundaries aroundthe islands. The men are scheduled to appear in St. John's for apreliminary hearing on Oct. 3.   ``Canada has a lot of progress to make as a civilized country,''said Albert Pen, a senator from the islands and one of the 21people who took part in the fishing protest.   Also among the group was Gerard Grignon, a member of the Frenchchamber of deputies on the islands, and Victor Reux and MarcPlantegenest, two members of the islands' territorial government.   In Edmonton, External Affairs Minister Joe Clark defended thearrests.   ``This is a matter which is essentially a fishery dispute, avery important one. It is capable of being resolved bynegotiation,'' said Clark. ``In the meantime, if Canadian law isbreached Canadian law will be enforced.''   During the weekend, President Francois Mitterrand of France saidit was ``intolerable'' that the islanders were not able to fishnormally ``in waters they have for a long time been accustomed touse for that work.''</TEXT></DOC>
