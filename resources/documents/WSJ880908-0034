They contend that market inefficiency is creating buying opportunities in the most household of household names -- consumer-staple stocks such as McDonald's, PepsiCo, Coca-Cola Co. and Anheuser-Busch.    Several such big-name issues this year have underperformed the Standard andamp; Poor's 500, which has gained 7.6% since Jan. 1. Market watchers point to the price/earnings multiple of the consumer growth stocks to make their case.    Take McDonald's, for example. Based on analyst projections that the fast-food company will earn $3.40 a share this year, the stock is selling at about 13 times 1988 earnings. (It closed yesterday at 45 1/4.)    Then compare that with the Sandamp;P, which is selling at about 12.5 times estimated 1988 earnings. Says Scott M. Black, president of Delphi Management, a Boston money manager: &quot;These are companies that are industry leaders, that you know in 20 years are still going to be industry leaders. Yet you can still buy them at right around the multiple of the Sandamp;P.&quot;    To make his point another way, Mr. Black asks: &quot;Which would you rather own over the next several years, Coke or a cyclical like Aluminum Co. of America, which is going to have good years and bad years?&quot; Many of the big consumer-goods stocks are trading at just a point or two more than the market multiple.    The values were created, analysts say, because investors bolted en masse from consumer stocks to heavy industry, cyclical-type issues earlier this year. &quot;It reflects the market's myopia in not looking at the longevity of potential earnings growth,&quot; contends Joseph J. Doyle, a managing director at Smith Barney. &quot;When it became clear that the crash wasn't the beginning of the end of the U.S. economy, then the cyclical names came to the forefront.&quot;    But the belief on Wall Street has shifted radically since then. Now some economists think that many cyclicals are posting near-peak earnings and that a recession is in view for 1989.    This would appear to be good news for holders of companies with household names that tend to show double-digit earnings growth in good economic times and bad. &quot;When you have a cyclical rebound, with steel companies emerging from the depths, a 15% growth rate doesn't look so good,&quot; says Emanuel Goldman, an analyst at PaineWebber in San Francisco. But that same 15% growth will look mighty strong when the economy enters a recession and those steel companies' profits slow, he adds.    The consumer issues have started coming &quot;to the forefront on a selective basis,&quot; Smith Barney's Mr. Doyle says. &quot;I've been getting calls from analysts and portfolio managers I haven't heard from in several months.&quot;    If the recession theory holds, consumers will continue to buy the fast-food, beer and soft drinks that these companies offer, the analysts argue.    In the most recent recession, which lasted roughly from the beginning of the fourth quarter of 1981 until the end of 1982, Anheuser shares outperformed the overall market by 40%, Mr. Doyle says. During that period, McDonald's did 20% better than the market and Coke outperformed the market by 22%. (Pepsi was beset by some accounting problems in late 1982 and underperformed the overall market.)    Messrs. Doyle and Goldman estimate that the stocks historically have sold at about a 25% to 35% premium to the Sandamp;P 500 based on current years' earnings.    To be sure, some Wall Street players dispute that a 1989 recession is in the offing, and therefore aren't buying the consumer staples play. Bruce Calvert, research director at Alliance Capital Management, New York, says, &quot;We don't think we're headed into a recession. We think we're going to have good economic growth through next year and into 1990.&quot;    Under the continued growth scenario, Mr. Calvert argues, the more compelling equity values are in the basic industry and processing companies and some technology concerns. Moreover, even if there is a downturn, &quot;we don't buy the model that during the next recession all the cyclical companies will earn what they earned during 1982, which is nothing,&quot; he adds.    Those companies will still have an exchange-rate advantage for exports and are far more streamlined than they were during the last recession, Mr. Calvert says.    Despite Mr. Calvert's general avoidance of the consumer-growth issues, he and PaineWebber's Mr. Goldman agree in one area: tobacco stocks, particularly RJR Nabisco and Philip Morris.    &quot;The risk-reward here is just outstanding,&quot; Mr. Goldman says. He expects Philip Morris to earn about $10.20 a share this year; at its current market price of 95 7/8, it sports a 9.4 multiple, well below the Sandamp;P 500.    &quot;You have a 20% growth rate, a great yield (about 5%) and a huge discount to the market,&quot; Mr. Goldman says. Of course, tobacco stocks continue to be held back by the question mark of liability cases. But Mr. Goldman contends that no new cases have been brought since the recent ruling that awarded no punitive damages to a New Jersey widower.    For Mr. Goldman, who follows beverages, food and tobacco stocks, these are exciting times. &quot;You can see it happening already,&quot; he says. &quot;Every analyst has his day and I think you're coming into mine.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
