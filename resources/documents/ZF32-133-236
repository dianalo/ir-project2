SullivanandM;S3 Inc. this week will announce its entry into the graphics chip market witha single-chip graphical user interface accelerator.andM;Designed for use on add-in graphics cards and 386/486 motherboards, S3's new86C911 GUI accelerator will maintain VGA compatibility while performingfaster than competing Super VGA chip sets, said Ron Yara, vice president ofmarketing for the 2-year-old Santa Clara, Calif., firm.andP;  &quot;With the shift fromDOS to GUI environments, the things that make the system run faster willchange,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;What we have done is put those functions in hardware.&quot;andM;For example, graphics operations such as moving blocks of bit maps withindisplay memory and hardware support for cursor functions are off-loaded fromthe CPU onto the new chip, he said.andP;  Add-in boards based on the new S3 chipand priced at less than $500 are expected to be demonstrated at PC Expo inNew York later this month, said Yara.andP;  The 86C911 will support displays withrefresh rates up to 72Hz and non-interlaced resolutions of 1,024 by 768pixels.andM;Graphics-board manufacturers said the coprocessor functions of the 86C911will make it an attractive product.andM;Jim Anderson, director of strategic marketing for Video Seven, a businessunit of Headland Technology Inc. in Fremont, Calif., said the new chip &quot;getsyou around having to transfer massive blocks of pixels over the AT bus.&quot; Hedeclined to comment on whether Video Seven will incorporate the S3 chip intoa product.andM;S3 is planning to begin volume production of the 86C911, priced at $75 inquantities of 1,000, in August, Yara said.andM;Founded by Chips and Technologies Inc. co-founders Yara and Dado Banatao, S3can be reached at (408) 986-8144.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
