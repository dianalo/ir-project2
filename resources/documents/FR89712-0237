If a mass-withdrawal-terminated plan has sufficient assetsand is closed out by purchasing annuities or making other permitted formsof distributions that provide all nonforfeitable benefits upon the termination,or if it becomes sufficient to close out based on its collection of withdrawalliability after the termination and does so, plan participants and themultiemployer insurance program will not be harmed. If, however, the planexperiences financial difficulties, such as losses in the value of planassets, adverse mortality, or inability to collect the full amount of withdrawalliability owed the plan, the interests of plan participants and the insuranceprogram may be adversely affected.Because a mass-withdrawal-terminated plan cannot look to employers forcontinued contributions or for additional withdrawal liability (beyondthat assessed pursuant to ERISA section 4219(c)(1)(D) and 29 CFR Part 2648as a result of the mass withdrawal), the Act imposes certain rules andobligations on the sponsor of a plan that has terminated by mass withdrawaland gives the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) authority toprescribe others. These rules require a plan sponsor to monitor the financialcondition of the plan and, depending on the condition of the plan, reduceor suspend benefits and apply to the PBGC for financial assistance. TheAct also restricts the types of payments that may be made by a plan thatis not closing out, regardless of its financial condition.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Proposed Regulation and Comments</ITAG>On July 7, 1986 (51 FR 24536), the PBGC published a proposed regulationon Powers and Duties of Plan Sponsor of Plan Terminated by Mass Withdrawal.The proposed regulation contained rules for the administration of multiemployerplans that terminated by mass withdrawal, including rules for determiningthe sufficiency of plan assets, distributing plan assets and reportingto the PBGC.The PBGC received comments on the proposed regulation from one interestedparty. The PBGC has reviewed the comments and made several changes in theregulation as a result of them. The PBGC has also made several editorialchanges in the regulation.The commenter noted that proposed andSection; 2675.12(c) reflected the limitationin ERISA section 4041A(c)(1) that a mass-withdrawal-terminated plan notpay benefits in excess of the amount that is nonforfeitable under the planas of the termination date. The proposed regulation did not, however, containa provision restating the PBGC's authority under section 4041A(f)(1) topermit payments in excess of nonforfeitable benefits if the PBGC determinesthat such payments are not adverse to the interests of the plan's participantsand beneficiaries generally and do not unreasonably increase the PBGC'srisk of loss with respect to the plan. (The same standard applies to PBGCapproval to pay benefits valued at more than $1,750 in a form other thanas an annuity.) The commenter urged that this authority be specificallyincluded in the regulation, and the PBGC believes this point is well taken.Therefore, the PBGC has added a new andSection; 2675.17 to the final regulation,which essentially restates section 4041A(f)(1).On a related point, the commenter questioned whether the limitation inandSection; 2675.12(c) was intended to cover the payment of qualified pre-retirementsurvivor annuities (QPSA's) where the participant had not died prior tothe date of the plan termination. The commenter noted that pursuant tothe definition of ``nonforfeitable benefit'' in ERISA section 4001(a)(8),the PBGC has always taken the position that pre-retirement death benefitsare not nonforfeitable if the participant is still alive at plan termination.The commenter went on to suggest that it was Congress' intent that QPSA'sbe payable under terminated plans, even though the participant had notdied before termination. The commenter cited as evidence the amendmentto ERISA section 4022, which applies only to single-employer plans, containedin the Single-Employer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1986 (SEPPAA). Underthat amendment, a QPSA under a terminated plan is not to be treated asforfeitable under section 4022 solely because the participant has not diedas of the plan termination date (section 4022(d), subsequently redesignatedsection 4022(e)). Given this expression of Congressional intent, the commenterconcluded, the PBGC should not interpret Title IV's multiemployer planprovisions so as to reach a contrary result.The PBGC agrees with the commenter that the Congress, through the enactmentof the Retirement Equity Act of 1984 (REA) and the subsequent amendmentto ERISA section 4022, has demonstrated a clear intent that pension plans,both ongoing and terminated, provide and pay qualified pre-retirement survivorannuities. However, in effecting this intent under Title IV, Congress didnot change the Title IV definition of ``nonforfeitable benefit''. Underthat definition the PBGC has taken the position described by the commenter:that QPSA's and other pre-retirement death benefits are not nonforfeitableif the participant is still alive at plan termination. Thus, it would bepermissible for a terminated multiemployer plan to pay QPSA's only if theplan obtained the PBGC's approval to do so pursuant to ERISA section 4041A(f)(1).After carefully reviewing this matter, the PBGC has concluded that it shouldgrant a blanket approval under section 4041A(f)(1) permitting all terminatedplans to pay QPSA's to the extent otherwise permitted by Subtitle E ofTitle IV. This approval is set forth in an amended paragraph (c) of andSection;2675.12.This decision is based on the PBGC's determination under section 4041A(f)(1)that the payment of QPSA's by terminated plans would not in any case beadverse to the interests of plan participants and beneficiaries generally,nor unreasonably increase the PBGC's risk of loss with respect to a terminatedplan. The Congress has, in essence, already determined that the paymentof QPSA's is beneficial to plan participants and beneficiaries. The PBGCdoes not find that the slight risk of a plan's becoming underfunded fornonforfeitable benefits or insolvent as a result of paying subsidized QPSA'ssupports a finding that the payment of QPSA's is adverse to the interestsof plan participants and beneficiaries generally. (In fact, in plans thatpay unsubsidized QPSA's, even this slight risk disappears.) The PBGC alsonotes in this regard that if a plan became insufficient for nonforfeitablebenefits, it would be required to stop paying and eliminate from the planQPSA's (and any other non-guaranteeable benefits), to the extent necessaryto ensure that plan assets are sufficient to pay when due all nonforfeitablebenefits under the plan (ERISA section 4281(c)).Similarly, the PBGC finds that because QPSA's are not guaranteed benefitsand because the value of QPSA subsidies is small, their payment cannotunreasonably increase the PBGC's risk of loss with respect to a terminatedplan.Finally, it is emphasized that because QPSA's are not nonforfeitable benefits,they remain subject to reduction or elimination under ERISA section 4281.This authorization for terminated plans to pay QPSA's in no way altersthe section 4281 rules pertaining to benefit reductions and suspensionsin financially trouble terminated plans.Section 2675.14(a) of the proposed regulation required plan sponsors todetermine the value of plan assets and nonforfeitable benefits not laterthan 150 days after the end of each plan year. The commenter objected tothis, asserting that this deadline is much shorter than that provided inthe regulation on Redetermination of Withdrawal Liability Upon Mass Withdrawal,andSection; 2648.2, for computing the amount of withdrawal liability to bereallocated to employers after a mass withdrawal termination. The PBGCfinds this argument unpersuasive.The relatively long time frame for calculating reallocation liability underPart 2648 is not intended to permit plans to delay the actuarial valuationfor the plan year in which the mass withdrawal termination occurred. Rather,it is intended to give the plan sponsor adequate time to determine theuncollectible amounts of outstanding withdrawal liability assessments (includingthose arising from the mass withdrawal), an integral part of the calculationof reallocation liability. Thus, the liberal time limit of andSection; 2648.2(b)(3)should normally provide enough time for the resolution of most withdrawalliability disputes prior to the deadline for calculating reallocation liability.The time limit for performing the annual plan valuation required of allmass-withdrawal-terminated plans (section 4281(b)(1)) is a separate issue.One purpose of the valuation is to enable the plan sponsor to determinewhether the plan must be amended to reduce or eliminate any nonguaranteeablebenefits provided under the plan pursuant to section 4281(c). (Nonguaranteeablebenefits must be reduced or eliminated whenever the annual valuation showsthat the value of the plan's nonforfeitable benefits exceeds the valueof plan assets.) Since any such amendment must be effective no later thansix months after the end of the plan year, it follows that the valuationmust be performed less than six months after the end of the plan year.For that reason, the final regulation provides that the annual valuationmust be completed within 150 days after the close of a plan year. The PBGCbelieves that 150 days is fully adequate for performing valuations of mass-withdrawal-terminatedplans.With respect to the benefit reductions required by section 4281(c), andSection;2675.21 of the proposed regulation contained the following sentence:<ITAG tagnum="21">Benefit reductions required to be made under this subpart shall applyonly to <T3>accrued</T3> benefits under plans or plan amendments adopted afterMarch 26, 1980, or under collective bargaining agreements entered intoafter March 26, 1980. (Emphasis added).</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The commenter noted that this sentence could be read to permit reductionsonly with respect to accrued benefits. This was not the PBGC's intent.Rather, this provision was meant to protect benefits accrued under pre-March27, 1980, plans, plan amendments or collective bargaining agreements. Thefinal rule has, therefore, been revised to clarify this point.The commenter raised two issues relating to the rules in Subpart E forclosing out mass-withdrawal-terminated plans. First, the commenter suggestedthat andSection; 2675.42 of the proposed regulation could be read as requiringplan sponsors of sufficient plans to pay out all benefits in all cases.The commenter recommended that plans be allowed to apply for a waiver ofthis requirement and also suggested that a provision be added to the finalregulation authorizing the PBGC to waive any of the requirements in theregulation.Section 2675.42, which addresses the method of distributing plan assets,is applicable only when the plan sponsor chooses to close out a sufficientplan. Section 2675.41 does not require the closeout of a sufficient plan.Rather, it provides merely that the plan sponsor of such a plan <T3>may </T3>close out the plan in accordance with the rules in SubpartE of the regulation. Read in context, it is thus clear that andSection; 2675.42does not require the plan sponsor of a sufficient plan to distribute planassets in full satisfaction of plan liabilities, unless it chooses to doso. There is, therefore, no need to permit plans to apply for a waiverof the requirements of andSection; 2675.42 to protect plans from having toclose out when that is not in the best interests of plan participants.Further, since the commenter offered no other examples of situations inwhich waivers of the regulation's requirements might be appropriate, thePBGC is not persuaded that a broader waiver provision should be added tothe regulation.The commenter also addressed andSection; 2675.43(b)(1) of the proposed regulation,which (pursuant to ERISA section 4041A(f)(1)) permitted a plan sponsorthat was closing out a plan to pay benefits attributable to employer contributionsin a form other than an annuity if the present value of the participant'sentire nonforfeitable benefit did not exceed $1,750. The commenter notedthat REA increased the non-consensual cashout limit for ongoing plans to$3,500 and suggested that the regulation be changed to incorporate thishigher cashout limit. The commenter also suggested that the regulationclarify whether plans must use select and ultimate interests rates in determiningthe present value of a participant's nonforfeitable benefit for this purpose.As alluded to previously the PBGC is authorized under section 4041A(f)(1)to permit the payment in a lump sum of benefits that exceed $1,750. Inorder to approve these higher cashouts, the PBGC must find that they arenot adverse to the interests of the plan's participants and beneficiariesgenerally and do not unreasonably increase the PBGC's risk of loss withrespect to the plan. When a plan is being closed out under Subpart 4, ahigher cashout limit would not be adverse to the interests of the plan'sparticipants and beneficiaries, since their nonforfeitable benefits mustbe fully satisfied as part of the closeout. This fact also ensures thatthe higher cashout limit will not unreasonably increase the PBGC's riskof loss with respect to the plan. Therefore, the PBGC has amended andSection;2675.43(b)(1) in the final regulation to increase to $3,500 the cashoutlimit for mass-withdrawal-terminated plans that are closing out. Such plansmay, of course, apply to the PBGC for permission to pay lump sum benefitsgreater than $3,500 (andSection; 2675.17).The select and ultimate interest rates referred to by the commenter arepart of the PBGC's regulation on Valuation of Plan Assets and Plan BenefitsFollowing Mass Withdrawal (29 CFR Part 2676). Proposed andSection; 2675.43(b)(1)required that benefits be valued in accordance with that regulation forpurposes of determining whether a benefit could be paid as a lump sum.The PBGC has since concluded that this is not the best approach.Section 1139 of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA), which applies to bothsingle-employer and multiemployer plans, provides that plans must calculatethe present value of benefits to be paid as a lump sum using ``the interestrate which would be used (as of the date of the distribution) by the PensionBenefit Guaranty Corporation for determining the present value of a lumpsum distribution on plan termination.'' The only situation in which thePBGC determines the present value of a lump sum distribution in a terminatedplan is under terminated single-employer plans trusteed by the PBGC. Thus,the reference in TRA section 1139 is to the interest rates prescribed under29 CFR Part 2619, Subpart C. These are the interest rates that ongoingmultiemployer plans are required to use for calculating sump sum benefits,and the PBGC believes that no valid purpose would be served by requiringthese plans to use a different interest assumption for these calculationsafter plan termination. (The PBGC also notes that, for some plans, thePart 2619, Subpart C interest assumption may be easier to use for calculatinglump sum than the Part 2676 interest assumption.) Accordingly, the PBGChas modified andSection; 2675.43(b)(1) to provide that the present valueof the benefit is to be determined using the interest assumption underSubpart C of Part 2619.(The PBGC reminds plan sponsors that they may not use the Part 2619, SubpartC mortality assumption for calculating lump sum benefits. Rather, the planmust employ a unisex mortality assumption for this purpose. The mortalityassumption used must be, in conjunction with the Part 2619, Subpart C interestassumption, reasonable in the aggregate.)Finally, the PBGC, at its own initiative, has made one minor change inandSection; 2675.43(c), deleting the requirement that the notice of electionfor alternative forms of distribution contain a statement that the PBGCdoes not guarantee the alternative form. This language was misleading inpossibly suggesting that the PBGC's guarantee of multiemployer plan benefitsextends beyond the obligation to provide financial assistance to insolventplans (<T3>see </T3>PBGC Opinion Letter 85-24).<ITAG tagnum="84">E.O. 12291 and Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation has determined that this regulationis not a ``major rule'' for the purposes of Executive Order 12291 becausethe rule will not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 millionor more; or create a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individualindustries, or geographic regions; or have significant adverse effectson competition, employment, investment, innovation or the ability of UnitedStates-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domesticor import markets. ERISA establishes requirements and standards for theadministration of multiemployer plans that have terminated by mass withdrawal;this regulation implements those requirements and standards.Under section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the PBGC certifiesthat this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities. Pension plans with fewer than 100 participantshave traditionally been treated as small plans. The proposed regulationaffects only multiemployer plans covered by the PBGC under Title IV ofERISA. If ``small'' plans are defined as those with fewer than 100 participants,the PBGC's coverage of small plans extends to less than 14 percent of allmultiemployer plans covered by the PBGC (346 out of 2,485 plans). Further,small multiemployer plans represent only 0.4 percent of all small planscovered by the PBGC (346 out of 84,288 plans). Based on the PBGC's experienceto date, it is estimated that no more than 10 multiemployer plans willbe terminated by mass withdrawal in any given year. Thus, the PBGC expectsthere to be few plans that may need to be administered under these rules.Therefore, compliance with sections 603 and 604 of the Regulatory FlexibilityAct is waived.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>29 CFR Part 2670Employee benefit plans, Pension insurance.29 CFR Part 2675Employee benefit plans, Pensions and reporting requirements.In consideration of the foregoing, Subchapter H of Chapter XXVI of Title29, Code of Federal Regulations is amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 2670_DEFINITIONS</ITAG>1.
