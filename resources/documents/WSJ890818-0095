He avoids using the word apartheid. He talks fondly of a new South Africa free of white domination. He pledges to use &quot;every ounce of energy&quot; to begin negotiations with black leaders for a new constitution. But much of his audience, in one of this country's few bastions of white liberalism, isn't convinced. Hecklers say his new South Africa sounds a lot like the old, or present, one.    Finally, Mr. de Klerk makes a final, impassioned pitch. &quot;Stop making racists out of us,&quot; he says. &quot;We aren't racists.&quot;    South Africa's campaign trail has always been a rough-and-tumble place, where the intense emotions of this deeply polarized country are stripped bare. But this year's trail, leading to the Sept. 6 parliamentary election, is particularly treacherous for Mr. de Klerk's National Party, which is facing its sternest test from parties to both the left and the right since it assumed power in 1948. It is also turning into a tough proving ground for Mr. de Klerk, who is enduring the scrutiny not only of South African voters but also of a curious international community as he tries to retool his reputation from conservative segregationist to enlightened reformer.    Even the voteless black majority is testing Mr. de Klerk's reformist intentions. The Mass Democratic Movement, a coalition of anti-apartheid groups, says organizations that have been restricted under the government's three-year-old state of emergency will defy their restrictions this weekend by holding previously forbidden political gatherings. In recent days, police have begun arresting and detaining participants in the movement's &quot;defiance campaign,&quot; and Mr. de Klerk warns that he won't hesitate to clamp down on protesters if violence erupts. But the movement, in a press statement, says any government action against this weekend's meetings will &quot;belie Mr. de Klerk's assertion that he is moving away from apartheid toward a South Africa free from racial oppression.&quot;    On the campaign stump, Mr. de Klerk is trying to erase the two most vivid images of South Africa: the scowling and vengeful countenance of P.W. Botha, who resigned from the presidency earlier this week after a power struggle with Mr. de Klerk, and the oppressive and unjust face of apartheid, the National Party's policy of racial segregation that has made South Africa an international pariah. In contrast, Mr. de Klerk projects a smiling and jocular presence; instead of belittling campaign hecklers, as Mr. Botha would have, Mr. de Klerk jousts good-naturedly with them. And, in those rare moments when he mentions apartheid, it sounds as if it is a concept from another time and another place -- and another party.    &quot;I have been in Parliament for 17 years and have never used the word apartheid positively,&quot; Mr. de Klerk tells a campaign rally held at a primary school in a wealthy, liberal suburb of Johannesburg. &quot;Apartheid is the policy of the Conservative Party. Stop hanging it around the National Party's head.&quot;    But whether the National Party is indeed ready, and willing, to shed the yoke of apartheid is a key question of this election. For while the Nationalists are trying to lure support away from the anti-apartheid Democratic Party with reformist talk, they also are careful not to give away too much ground to the pro-apartheid Conservative Party, which is enticing voters with its claims that the National Party is selling out white interests. This makes for confusing rhetoric and leaves few hints as to how far Mr. de Klerk will actually travel down the road of reform to accommodate the political aspirations of the disfranchised black majority, should he win the election, as is expected.    Leaning on a podium festooned with a National Party poster proclaiming &quot;fairness, firmness, peace,&quot; Mr. de Klerk says, &quot;White domination must come to an end, but we're not prepared to exchange it for black domination.&quot; Asks a heckler: &quot;What then?&quot; &quot;Two wrongs don't make a right,&quot; says Mr. de Klerk. Fairness, he later adds, &quot;also means fairness for us,&quot; meaning whites.    He promises justice for all, but not at the expense of security for whites. &quot;We're not prepared to make other people free to allow this country to fall into chaos,&quot; he says. Shouts another heckler, &quot;It's in chaos already.&quot;    He pledges to negotiate with everyone, but not with the banned African National Congress, which includes guerrilla activity in its campaign to topple the government. &quot;We're not afraid to talk to people who differ with us. But we say we aren't prepared to compromise with violence and terrorism,&quot; he says. &quot;We want to engage recognized leaders in discussion.&quot; Someone calls out the name of Nelson Mandela, the leader of the ANC and the world's most famous political prisoner. &quot;I think much too much credence is given to the ANC,&quot; Mr. de Klerk says.    He vows to rebuild a vibrant economy, without which, he says, a political solution isn't possible. &quot;Your party wrecked the economy,&quot; says a heckler. Mr. de Klerk admits that mistakes have been made, but adds that much of the damage has been done by international sanctions, such as &quot;a total cutoff of foreign capital.&quot; An angry voice shouts, &quot;Why? Tell us why?&quot; Mr. de Klerk responds: &quot;Mainly because we refused to accept an ANC government.&quot;    He says all South Africans, regardless of color, should participate equally on all levels of government, but not necessarily together. A common voters roll would lead to black majority rule and infringe on the rights of minority groups, such as whites, he warns. Group protection has been at the heart of National Party policy for the past 40 years, and will remain so, he says. &quot;Safety, prosperity and dignity as an individual and within his or her own group,&quot; promises Mr. de Klerk. &quot;This reflects the reality of South Africa.&quot; A voice from the back cries, &quot;Sounds like apartheid.&quot;    Mr. de Klerk, the reformer, is encouraged, for he senses at least one consensus here. &quot;The status quo must be changed,&quot; he says, &quot;and be changed drastically.&quot;    Mumbles a heckler: &quot;I'll say.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
