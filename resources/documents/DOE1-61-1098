Of those contaminants associatedwith uranium mull tailings which were identified as not being effectivelyimmobilized by tailing neutralization, radium imposes an important environmentalconcern in terms of potential groundwater contamination. Control or attenuationof radium is of special concern primarily due to its radiological healthimplications. For that reason, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)has implemented strict guidelines governing the maximum allowable concentrationin drinking waters. Current EPA guidelines call for total radium activitiesnot to exceed 5 rhoCi/L. Due to the high activity of soluble radium inthe acidic uranium mill tailings environment (several hundred to severalthousand rhoCi/L), specific ion removal procedures were investigatedfor use in attenuating radium in order to prevent future groundwatercontamination. Results of these investigations led to the developmentof a tailing additive comprised of a moisture of hydrated lime and bariumchloride, which, added to acidic tailings, can reduce the amount of leachableradium escaping a designated tailing impoundment. In laboratory verificationtests, this radium specific tailings treatment reduced the effluent solutionactivity of radium by three orders of magnitude, from andgt;3500 rhoCi/L to1.7 pCi/L, in comparison with untreated acidic tailings.</TEXT></DOC>
