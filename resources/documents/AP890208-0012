The broker, Byron T. ``Bud'' Brown, taped the conversations incooperation with investigators for the Senate Select Committee onIndian Affairs and testified with a grant of immunity before thecommittee's special investigative unit.   Brown said he arranged for businessman Tom Tracy to buy the491,000-acre Big Boquillas ranch in Arizona for $26.2 million fromTenneco West Co., and then immediately sell it for $33.4 million tothe Navajos. Brown, a real estate broker, also received a $750,000commission from Tenneco.   Brown said the $7.2 million profit was shared by Tracy, Brown andPeter MacDonald, chairman of the Navajo tribe.   Brown told the panel he paid MacDonald $25,000 to cover a bankloan and gave him $50,000 in cash and an expensively equipped BMWautomobile as his share of the profits.   He said MacDonald's reaction to the idea of ``flipping'' theranch to the tribe for the higher price, was to smile and say ``Iassume that I will be taken care of.''   ``I said `certainly,''' Brown told the panel.   Brown said the dollar amount was not arrived at immediately, butlater MacDonald came to him and said he needed $25,000 to pay on abank loan. The money was supplied through Tracy, Brown said.   MacDonald's loan money request was followed by one for the BMWwhich also was supplied through Tracy, Brown said.   Following sale of the ranch, Brown said he personally paidMacDonald several $5,000 increments in $100 bills. The payments werearranged by MacDonald's son, Peter MacDonald Jr. who called Brownwhen his father needed money and use the word ``golf balls'' as acode for money.   Sale of the ranch raised eyebrows locally and press publicity wasfollowed by an investigation by the local U.S. attorney, Brown said.   When the probe began, the senior MacDonald wanted to cover up thefact that he had received the $25,000 bank loan payment and the BMW,the real estate broker said.   In a recording of a conversation made Nov. 22, 1988, the seniorMacDonald told Brown he should say that his son Peter was therecipient of the $25,000 and the car.   When Brown talked to the junior MacDonald on Dec. 14, 1988, thetape has the son saying, ``We're all three of us Three Musketeersshoulder to shoulder,'' in reference to Brown's question as towhether he would stick by the story with his father and Brown.   On Monday, the junior MacDonald, an attorney, told the committeeunder immunity that he went along with the scheme ``because I lovemy father.''   The senior MacDonald has not testified and committee staff saidno agreement to grant him immunity has been reached. Furthermore,his part in the ranch land sale is under investigation by a federalgrand jury and a movement has begun among the Navajos to recall himas chairman.   However, a letter was released Tuesday from a Navajo task forcesaying, ``Various individuals have implicated and levelled chargesagainst the Navajo Nation without substantiating their allegationswith facts. Such malicious allegations are attempts to discredit theintegrity of the Navajo Nation, its people, government andsovereignty.''   The letter called for representation by the Navajo nation beforethe committee for rebuttal.   The letter said the Navajos understood that the hearings wereprimarily to be into alleged misconduct by the Bureau of IndianAffairs.   ``While corruption may exist in any government or at any levelwithin the Navajo Nation, as it may in Washington, D.C., theCommittee's nearly exclusive focus on selected abuses is creatingthe public impression that corruption at Navajo is universal,'' theletter said.   The hearings began Jan. 30, will continue through this week, andfor several days later this month.   Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., who chairs the specialinvestigative unit, said arrangements to have members of the Navajotask force testify in the latter part of the month would be made.</TEXT></DOC>
