The Pandarama exhibit, sponsored by Michigan United ConservationClubs and the state Department of Natural Resources, would havedisplayed the animals for 100 days this summer at the MichiganState Fairgrounds in Detroit.   Under an agreement with China's Sichuan Province, the exhibitorswould pay at least $300,000 for the loan of the pandas, and themoney would be used to build a panda captive-breeding facility andto improve wild pandas' natural habitat.   ``There are some risks to the species from the loan which arenot adequately outweighed by the potential benefits,'' the Fish andWildlife decision said. ``A reduction in the threat of extinctionfrom this import cannot be demonstrated from the information in therecord.''   The decision said expansion of facilities for breeding pandas incaptivity ``could lead to the removal of additional animals fromthe wild to stock it.''   The two pandas proposed for the Michigan exhibit are alreadyliving in captivity in the Chendu Zoo.   Under an international treaty, pandas born in 1984 and aftercannot be imported without a permit. Fewer than 1,000 giant pandasare thought to exist.   A spokesman for Michigan United Conservation Clubs, Don Stypula,said the agency's ruling was ``preposterous'' and the exhibit'sorganizers would appeal through administrative channels.   ``We're wondering now how the Chinese are going to react tothis,'' Stypula said. ``This is a slap in the face to them, more sothan to us.''   The Fish and Wildlife decision came amid efforts by the WorldWildlife Fund and the American Association of Zoological Parks andAquariums, to close an exhibition of two Chinese pandas in Toledo,Ohio.   After the Fish and Wildlife Service granted permission for theToledo exhibition, the animal preservation groups sued in federalcourt in Washington. They argued that the Fish and Wildlife Servicefailed to determine that the pandas weren't imported for commercialpurposes and that their display would promote survival of thespecies. Both are criteria for issuing an import permit.   The Toledo Zoo argued that closing the exhibit would deny thepublic a chance to see the endangered species and to learnsomething about China. Zoo attorneys also said closing theexhibition could harm international relations between the UnitedStates and China.   David Klinger, a spokesman for the Fish and Wildlife Service,said the agency found ``a more conclusive demonstration of benefitto the species in the Toledo case.''   The decision also said having an exhibition in Detroit at thesame time one was under way in nearby Toledo would reduce theeducational benefits.   Backers of the Toledo exhibit reached agreement for the loanwith the China Wildlife Conservation Association, which isaffiliated with China's national government.   The Michigan organizers dealt with official bodies in SichuanProvince, where most wild pandas live. The provincial authoritiesin turn handled contacts with China's national government, Stypulasaid.   William Reilly, president of the World Wildlife Fund, praisedthe denial of the Michigan permit. ``Short-term loans of giantpandas to the United States were out of control,'' he said.``Economic incentives simply cannot be allowed to drive Americanzoos and amusement parks to import pandas.''</TEXT></DOC>
