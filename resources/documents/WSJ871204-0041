A look at them shows a field nearly as diverse as the nation itself. They range from the scion of one of America's great family fortunes to the son of immigrants to an illegitimate child reared in a working-class black family.    Their occupations differ as well. Several are lawyers. But two made their mark as men of the cloth. One spent most of his life as a professional soldier.    They are from every geographic corner of the country. Some are from states -- Arizona, Delaware -- that have never before given the nation a president.    Politically, they would chart widely different courses on issues from arms control to AIDS.    To find out more about the candidates, The Wall Street Journal sent each a questionnaire asking about their beliefs and the experiences and influences that shaped them. Some of the answers were perhaps predictable: The most common influences on the political development of the candidates were Abraham Lincoln and Thomas Jefferson. Others were not: If he weren't in politics, one candidate says he would be excavating an archeological site; another claims he might be hosting the &quot;Tonight&quot; show.    Here, then -- in answers drawn from their campaigns and public statements, and augmented by the Journal questionnaire -- are the candidates of 1988.
