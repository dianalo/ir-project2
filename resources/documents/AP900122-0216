It holds annualtennis and golf tournaments and sponsors a yearly jazz festival inthe mountain resort of Madarao. The company even constructed fivebird sanctuaries at its facilities throughout Japan in cooperationwith the Japanese Association for the Preservation of Birds.   Suntory will have money in at least one more Shubert show thisseason _ the Steppenwolf Theater Company's adaptation of JohnSteinbeck's ``The Grapes of Wrath.'' It's among the more eagerlyawaited offerings of the year.   American musicals have been performed in Japan with Japanesecasts for years. Audiences have long been familiar with ``My FairLady'' and ``West Side Story.'' A Japanese-language version of``Cats'' was a big success. So was ``Big River,'' based on MarkTwain's ``The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.'' The show even usedthe original American star, Ron Richardson, who learned Japanesefor his role but sang most of his songs as the runaway slave Jim inEnglish.   But Broadway musicals with American casts were new to Japan inthe early 1980s. Enormously expensive to produce because thecompany and scenery had to be flown to Japan, they neverthelesswere able to generate prestige and enormous publicity if notprofits for the sponsoring company.   ``There's a great promotional aspect to presenting shows inJapan, much more than there is here,'' Schoenfeld says. ``There isa corporate identification with a show in Japan. Audiences willidentify `Jerome Robbins' as the Suntory production of `JeromeRobbins' Broadway' when it plays there in 1991.''   After ``Dancin','' Suntory, among others, helped take anAmerican-cast version of ``Duke Ellington's Sophisticated Ladies''to Japan. TV Asahi, one of Japan's biggest television networks,sponsored a Weissler production of ``My One and Only,'' starringTommy Tune and Sandy Duncan. Next fall Weissler will send Topol toTokyo and Osaka in ``Fiddler on the Roof'' under the aegis of C.Itoh, a major shipping conglomerate.   ``Traditional corporate entertainment was always limited to menin Japan, but with Broadway shows they could provide dinner and amusical for a husband and wife,'' says Kenji Kitatani, a vicepresident for Tokyo Broadcasting and a professor intelecommunications management at Indiana University. ``It became anew tool for large corporations to entertain clients or potentialclients. It was a new way of marketing.   ``There is more money available in Japan now than ever before,and all of those elements accelerated the boom of Broadway shows inJapan.''   But an investment in the American theater still remains anuncertain opportunity, no matter who provides the money. SeveralJapanese companies have been burned. The musical ``Blues in theNight,'' done off-Broadway in 1988 with financial backing from TVAsahi, closed after a short engagement.   ``3 Penny Opera'' was one of the season's biggest critical andfinancial flops. It dropped an estimated $4.5 million, including aninvestment from Haruki Kadokawa, head of one of Japan's largestpublishing companies. ``The Secret Rapture'' by David Hare lost$800,000, some of it Suntory money, during its brief two-week run.   But Suntory does have an investment in ``City of Angels,'' theCy Coleman musical about a private eye in 1940s Los Angeles. It isthe season's biggest new musical hit and the likely Tony winner inJune. And the original cast recording rights have been won, after aspirited bidding, by CBS Records, which now happens to be owned byanother Japanese company, Sony.   Kitatani brought Tokyo Broadcasting into ``Gypsy,'' through hisassociation with one of the producers, Pace International. Butofficials of the big Japanese television network only committedthemselves to the show after careful analysis of the property.   ``The reason they did `Gypsy' was that they believed in it,''Kitatani says. ``They researched the track record of the producers,Barry and Fran Weissler. They looked at Tyne Daly's level ofacceptance in the United States and then, of course, they looked atthe past performance record of `Gypsy,' which has been done twicebefore on Broadway.   ``They felt very comfortable betting their money on the show.You might think that when they are 5,000 miles away from Broadwaythey don't study those things, but they do.''</TEXT><NOTE>END ADV</NOTE></DOC>
