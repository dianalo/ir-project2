Keating Jr., chairman of AmericanContinental Corp., and five other top executives of thePhoenix-based corporation resigned Friday following two legaldefeats, Keating's attorney said.   Also resigning were corporation president Judy J. Wischer, andRobert J. Kielty, Robert M. Wurzelbacher Jr., Andrew F. Ligget andBradley J. Boland.   On Thursday, a federal judge in Washington ruled that Keatingand his associates had looted Lincoln Savings and Loan Associationof millions of dollars in federally insured deposits.   The day before, a Los Angeles judge said Keating must prove thathe is out of money and ordered him not to transfer funds out of thecountry.   Keating could not be reached to comment on his resignation.Stephen C. Neal, his personal attorney, released a short statementon his behalf.   ``While we vigorously disagree with the opinion expressedyesterday by Judge Stanley Sporkin of the United States DistrictCourt, it has become clear that my client must now concentrate allhis energy on aggressively defending the legal charges againsthim,'' Neal said.   ``Because of that, and in light of the fact that theseindividuals are no longer in a position to effectively direct ACC,they have resigned from all of their positions, effectiveimmediately.''   Boland, Keating's son-in-law, had been the corporation'spublic-relations chief. Kielty was senior vice president andgeneral counsel, Ligget was the chief financial officer, andWurzelbacher had been president of a commercial real-estatesubsidiary.   American Continental and 11 subsidiaries filed forreorganization under Chapter 11 of federal bankrupcty laws on April13, 1989, and federal regulators took control of Lincoln, a $5.8billion, California-based Sandamp;L which was the corporation's primaryasset.   Keating claimed that the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and itssuccessors, the Resolution Trust Corporation and the Office ofThrift Supervision, had waged war with him because of his standsagainst government regulation.   Sporkin heard more than 30 days of testimony before rulingThursday that Keating and the others abused their positions in what``amounted to a looting of Lincoln.'' Sporkin also dismissedKeating's suit to recover Lincoln.   Regulators have estimated that Keating's use of Lincoln'sfederally insured deposits to finance various junk bond, stock andreal estate ventures and the institution's subsequent collapsecould cost taxpayers as much as $2 billion.   The government already has spent $1.2 billion keeping Lincolnand its more than 20 branches in Southern California afloat,according to lawyers in the case. The government also has a $1.3billion civil fraud and racketeering suit pending against Keating.</TEXT></DOC>
