 Scanners create digitized images of incomingdocuments, reducing the number of people required to handle the paper.andP;  Theseimages are stored on optical disks, reducing the amount of space required tostore the paper.andM;Images related to a single subject can be linked electronically, reducing theeffort required to retrieve the information needed to perform a task.andP;  Workcan be assigned by priority and tracked for completion, reducing thelikelihood that steps will be skipped and important projects deferred oroverlooked.andP;  A file can be retrieved simultaneously by any number of people,reducing the processing time involved in moving a paper file from one desk toanother, and eliminating the possibility that file information will be lost.andM;Imaging systems also offer opportunities for entirely new product and serviceofferings.andP;  Today's user organizations have barely begun to discover themyriad of competitive opportunities image systems can present.andP;  A cluster oftechnological advances-primarily in mass storage, graphic display, andtelecommunications-have cleared the way for full-fledged electronic imageprocessing.andP;  No longer must the daily mail delivery be a daily trauma for theinformation-dependent office.andM;THE IMAGE MARKETPLACE.andP;  With all of its promise for improved productivity andreduced costs, image processing today is an immature and often confusingmarketplace-just as now-accepted information systems technologies such asdatabase management systems and personal computers were a few years ago.andO;Vertical markets are poorly defined, and generic systems built for specificindustries are almost nonexistent.andP;  New vendors appear, flourish briefly, andshrivel into oblivion like toadstools, practically overnight.andP;  Mergers andstrategic alliances occur with dizzying frequency.andM;Because standards are lacking, it is not yet possible to buy imaging systemcomponents, hook them up, and have a working system without a great deal ofeffort and frustration.andP;  Systems integrators and service bureaus are asimportant to a successful imaging implementation as they ever were to a dataprocessing implementation.andP;  Customers tend to buy projects, not products; ina typical project, half the expense is associated with support and service,40 percent with hardware and 10 percent with software.andM;Immature though it may be, the growth outlook for electronic imaging isimpressive.andP;  A survey of trade members of the Association for Information andImage Management (AIIM), done by Temple, Barker and Sloane, predicts afive-year compound annual growth rate of 54 percent-from $800 million in 1988to $6.8 billion in 1993.andP;  More than 20,000 people attended AIIM's annualtrade show in 1989, compared with 12,000 at the same site three yearsearlier.andP;  Vendors there said there were fewer &quot;tire kickers&quot; at the 1989show, more people ready to buy and with concrete applications in mind.andM;ENABLING TECHNOLOGIES.andP;  At its simplest, an imaging system consists of anoptical scanner to create a digitized image of a document, an optical diskand disk drive for storing and retrieving the image, and a high-resolutionworkstation on which to look at the image.andP;  Such a system would provide &quot;fileand find&quot; capability for a single user.andM;The ability to retrieve an image implies that it has been indexed.andP;  Indexingmay be done before or after scanning.andP;  The index is commonly written onmagnetic media, then copied to the optical disk when it is full.andP;  Thus, theimaging system usually includes a magnetic disk subsystem.andM;Often the number of documents that must be readily available for inspectionexceeds the capacity of a single optical disk.andP;  In this case, the opticaldisk drive is replaced with an optical jukebox, which works in much the samemanner as the jukebox in the local diner.andM;Although the main purpose of most imaging applications is to minimize the useof paper, sometimes a hard-copy reproduction of a document is necessary.andO;Therefore, most image systems include at least one laser printer.andP;  Facsimilecapability is often part of the image system, and most systems are linked toa mainframe or minicomputer for access to coded information.andP;  Most imagesystems support more than one user, and a local area network is also part ofthe system.andM;Imaging is a highly software-intensive application.andP;  Software handles theindexing and retrieval.andP;  Images are compressed when stored and decompressedfor viewing; usually the compression algorithms are embodied in software, butsometimes they are coded in a chip within the scanner.andP;  Optical characterrecognition, where it is used, is usually a function of software.andP;  Expertsystems software will become increasingly important as image applicationsgrow in competence and acceptance.andM;Barriers to Acceptance.andP;  People may want the benefits that electronic imagingcan bring, but barriers to acceptance of the technology still remain.andP;  Manyexecutives have adopted a wait-and-see attitude before making a purchasingdecision.andP;  Some question the longevity of optical disks and wonder how longdocuments &quot;put to glass&quot; will remain legible.andP;  The standard industryguarantee, 10 years when the first optical disks were introduced, is now 20or 30 years.andP;  Sony offers a 100-year guarantee, but obviously nobody canprove that claim.andM;Fragmentation in the marketplace-the presence of literally hundreds of small,independent vendors, none of whom has significant market share-makes buyersnervous.andP;  How can they be sure that the company they buy from today will beanswering the phone tomorrow?andM;Some people defer purchase of an electronic imaging system because of thehigh initial investment required.andP;  They believe, and rightly, that priceswill come down.andP;  Whether it makes sense to wait, meanwhile incurring all thecosts and risks associated with manual paper handling, is an importantbusiness decision.andM;Lack of standards impedes sales because of fears of obsolescence, as well asconfusion about how to obtain a system that will work.andP;  Users will drive themovement toward standards by looking for systems that offer compatibility.andO;Manufacturers have an interest in creating an environment that will encouragerapid market growth in order to recoup their investments in research anddevelopment.andP;  They will not miss the point.andM;Electronic imaging, however, is not a technology looking for a market.andP;  Themarket is there, and it is hungry for solutions.andP;  For one thing, businessdecision-makers know that today's competitive climate leaves little marginfor error, making it critical that decisions be based on the most accurateand current information possible.andM;In addition, we are all in danger of drowning in paper.andP;  Our knowledge baseis said to be doubling every 18 months.andP;  Each working day, more than abillion documents are generated in the United States alone-everything frominvoices to correspondence and reports.andP;  Electronic storage and retrieval isour best hope of being able to put information away with any reasonableexpectation of finding it again.andM;This article is excerpted from an upcoming Seybold Special Report on ImageProcessing Systems.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
