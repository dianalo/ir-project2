(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Republican J. Marshall Coleman chargedThursday that his Democratic opponent for governor, L. DouglasWilder, is being judged by a ``double standard'' in his bid tobecome the nation's first elected black governor.   Coleman said Wilder, the lieutenant governor, receives favorabletreatment from the press, but he stopped short of identifying raceas the reason.   ``I don't know what the reason is,'' Coleman said during aheated 30-minute news conference at the state Capitol. ``All I knowis I see it because I am on the receiving end of it.''   ``I don't think it matters how much history Doug Wilder'selection Tuesday would make,'' said Coleman, a former attorneygeneral. ``He has to meet the same high standards that Virginianshave always demanded of their governors.''   Laura Dillard, Wilder's press secretary, said Coleman's remarkswere ``offensive and will sicken the voters of Virginia. ... I amoffended that Marshall Coleman is so desperate that he wouldsuggest that.''   Ms. Dillard said Wilder has been thoroughly scrutinized by thepress. ``I will leave it to others to conclude what is behind'' thedouble-standard claim, she said.   A poll published last weekend in The Washington Post showedColeman trailing Wilder by 15 percentage points.   At the news conference, Coleman introduced the subject bysaying: ``Many of you have asked me in recent days whether I thinkthere is a double standard involved where Mr. Wilder is concerned.''   ``I will give you an answer,'' he added.   Coleman then listed seven points, among them Wilder's reprimandby the Virginia Supreme Court in 1978 for mishandling a case;sponsoring legislation to pay money to a client who was threateninga malpractice lawsuit; housing code violations by property Wilderowned; and charging fees for speeches to state groups after hiselection to the state's No. 2 office in 1985.   In such cases, Coleman said, if he had been the offender hewould be ``laughed out of the contest'' and ``not be in therunning.''   ``But, for the most part, members of the news media have treatedthese examples of dishonesty and corruption as minor foibles,'' hesaid.   Coleman called the news conference and invited Wilder to attendto explain the tape, which contains comments Wilder made to UnitedMine Workers at a private meeting last summer.   On the tape, Wilder said he would support amending the state'sright-to-work law, which forbids compulsory union membership, toallow labor contracts under which non-union members would pay duesto the union that negotiated the agreement.   After the tape was released Tuesday, Wilder said he would vetoany effort to weaken the right-to-work law and said the tape didnot contradict that position.   Coleman said the tape shows that Wilder is ``so lacking inpersonal integrity that he would take two positions at once.''   Wilder, who said he saw no need to attend the Coleman newsconference, responded that he told the miners he would oppose anyweakening of the right-to-work law.   According to a transcript of the meeting, Wilder told the minersseveral times he supports the law and that there is no chance ofrepealing it. But when he was asked whether he supported theproposed amendment, Wilder responded, ``That's correct,'' thetranscript said.   Wilder went Wednesday to the College of William andamp; Mary inWilliamsburg, where he faced hecklers who shouted ``Why do youlie?'' at a student rally.   The handful of Republican students in the crowd of severalhundred students at the rally also carried signs that read, ``Doug,Your Nose Is Growing'' and ``Lies, Wilder and Audiotape.''   ``I didn't come here to answer mud,'' Wilder said between shouts.</TEXT></DOC>
