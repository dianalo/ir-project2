Douglas as executive director.;   The 10-0 vote followed weeks of behind-the-scenes efforts by two of the 12coastal commissioners to oust Douglas from the $70,000-a-year post.;   Commissioners David L. Malcolm and Mark Nathanson were said to be unhappy withDouglas' performance and were reportedly angered by his opposition tolegislation that would permit the Walt Disney Co. to fill in up to 250 acresof Long Beach shoreline for a proposed $3 billion theme resort and amusementpark.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  California News  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  OVERTHROW FAILS; COASTAL BOARD VOTES TO KEEPBOSS  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     But, when it came to the long-awaited showdown, neither Nathanson norMalcolm voted. Nathanson was absent and Malcolm, while present, allowed hisalternate to cast the vote.;    The vote brought an end to what Douglas calledpainful weeks of &quot;anxiety and distress.&quot;;    &quot;I can't do my work,&quot; Douglastold reporters shortly before the meeting at the Huntington Beach CivicCenter. &quot;The distraction and energy that have gone elsewhere in the lastcouple of weeks just has been incredibly draining for everybody.&quot;;    Douglas,who has held the post for six years, is often applauded by environmentalistsfor his efforts to protect the coast. But he has been criticized by developersfor his strict interpretation of the California Coastal Act.;    In the end,what had begun as an effort by Nathanson and Malcolm to oust Douglas wastransformed by chairman Thomas W. Gwyn into the commission's first detailedperformance evaluation of its executive director.;    The commission gaveDouglas overall high marks -- as well as new directives to step up recruitingof women and members of minority groups to staff positions and to accelerateefforts to complete local coastal plans. Under the California Coastal Act,coastal cities and counties assume the commission's decision-making authorityonce they have an approved local coastal plan.;    Douglas also was urged tosupplement the agency's budget by persuading private foundations andenvironmental groups to underwrite the costs of certain commission programs.He promised a written report to commissioners on how he would meet theirconcerns.;    As for the Disney controversy, Douglas repeated statements hemade a week ago that the entertainment giant had nothing to do with his jobreview. Disney issued a similar statement.;    But the lopsided vote appearedto settle, at least for the next year, Douglas' status with the commission andlaid to rest any suggestion that more than a few commissioners weredissatisfied with him.;    Bob Sulnic, executive director of the AmericanOceans Campaign, a Santa Monica-based coastal protection interest group,added, &quot;There was a real attempt to oust Peter by pro-developmentcommissioners. It failed. Community impact made it fail.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Los Angeles Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910720  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  4B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  453  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday July 20, 199100202067,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
