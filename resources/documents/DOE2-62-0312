The first signal consists of the pneumaticpressure of the bleed air at the first location; driving the valve toregulate pressure of bleed air supplied from the engine in response tothe first signal, the driving step including producing a control pressureof magnitude less than or equal to the first signal and actuating thevalve in response to the first signal and the control pressure; monitoringbleed air pressure at a second location downstream of the first locationat the outlet of the heat exchanger, the monitoring step producing asecond signal proportional to bleed air pressure at the second location.</TEXT></DOC>
