The company has agreed to plead guilty to fraud andvarious other felony charges, according to persons familiarwith the case, of resorting to corrupt middlemen, shamconsulting agreements and other illicit schemes to try tosnare defense contracts. The Unisys plea and a roughly100-page criminal information document spelling out a patternof illegal corporate activities will mark the climax of&quot;Operation Ill Wind&quot; -- the longest and most successfulinvestigation of military procurement corruption in recenttimes. The plea and criminal information are to be filedduring the next few weeks in federal court in Alexandria, Va.</LP><TEXT>   Meanwhile, federal prosecutors soon intend to seek anindictment on related charges against Melvyn Paisley, theNavy's former top purchasing official, according toinvestigators and others familiar with the matter. Mr.Paisley's lawyer, these persons said, has been told thatprosecutors will ask a federal grand jury to return anindictment as early as Thursday, accusing Mr. Paisley ofbribery, conspiracy and other felonies stemming partly fromhis dealings with Unisys executives and consultants in themid-1980s.   The most important and visible target of the five-yearnationwide probe of Pentagon corruption, Mr. Paisley hasmaintained his innocence and told prosecutors he intends tofight whatever charges are filed. Still, some investigatorsdidn't rule out last-minute negotiations on a plea agreement.   &quot;Mel Paisley's position hasn't changed,&quot; his attorney,Lawrence Barcella, said. &quot;He didn't take a bribe fromanybody.&quot;   Unisys, the computer and defense electronics giant basedin Blue Bell, Pa., confirmed that it intends to settle, butdeclined to comment on details of an agreement. SpokesmanPeter Hynes said: &quot;We are confident that, no matter what thenumber is, there are ways that a settlement can be reachedthat won't cripple the company.&quot;   U.S. Attorney Henry Hudson recently told an industry grouphis office has &quot;two or three cases . . . that we'refinishing&quot; to wrap up the major part of the Ill Wind probe.Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Aronica, the chief prosecutor,declined to comment.   So far, the grand jury inquiry has resulted in convictionsof more than 50 individuals and companies, with prosecutorscontinuing to investigate other former Pentagon acquisitionofficials and former executives of several other majorcontractors, including Grumman Corp. and United TechnologiesCorp.   For Unisys, the guilty plea will close a costly andinfamous chapter of its history. More than 10 individuals whoworked for its defense operations over the years -- includingprominent industry consultant William Galvin and formercompany Vice President Charles Gardner -- have been convictedas part of Ill Wind and are cooperating with theinvestigation.   Messrs. Galvin and Gardner, for example, have admitted toconspiring to bribe Mr. Paisley by purchasing an Idahocondominium from him in 1986 at an inflated price. In return,court documents allege, Mr. Paisley &quot;performed official actsto benefit&quot; Unisys and Sperry Corp., which merged withanother concern to become Unisys in 1986.   In addition, prosecutors have alleged that Mr. Gardner andseveral associates used a $5 million slush fund while workingat Unisys to funnel bribes to Pentagon officials, makeillegal campaign contributions to lawmakers, providekickbacks to offshore accounts they controlled, and pass onbogus bills to the Pentagon. Unisys years ago conducted aninternal inquiry, fired or transferred at least 17individuals, and agreed to cooperate with the government. Italso agreed in principle not to seek reimbursement from thePentagon for a wide range of consulting fees.   After more than 18 months of negotiations withprosecutors, the company now intends to sign a comprehensivepackage of criminal and civil fines, forgo certain profits,reduce claims for overhead costs, and accept othermultimillion-dollar penalties to resolve all of thegovernment's claims outstanding.   As part of the overall settlement, Unisys also has agreedto pay millions of dollars to resolve two pending criminalinvestigations that aren't part of the Ill Wind inquiry:allegations that it used improper cost estimates to winflight-trainer contracts, and that it improperly passed oncertain New Mexico state taxes to the Pentagon.   While the overall size of the agreement has been approvedby both sides, the financially strapped company still isdickering with the government about how much cash it willhave to pay, and how the payments can be spread out. Thecompany previously disclosed setting up a reserve of morethan $60 million to settle the criminal investigationsagainst it.   Officials said the Unisys pact, after all the penaltiesare added up, is likely to exceed the $186.3 million packageSundstrand Corp. signed two years ago to resolve criminal andcivil overcharge claims on military contracts.</TEXT></DOC>
