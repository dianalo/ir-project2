Adham, 41, a commodities trader with a Syrian diplomaticpassport, was expelled from France Tuesday night and is staying ata Geneva hotel.   He said he was certain the French government offered``compensation for the kidnappers,'' although he had no proof.   ``There were presents for everybody,'' he said, declining toelaborate.   Reports in Paris and Beirut said that in exchange for therelease of Marcel Carton, Marcel Fontaine and Jean-Paul Kauffmann,France agreed to repay the outstanding balance on a loan originallytotaling $1 billion made by the late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.The French government froze payments after the 1979 Islamicrevolution in Iran.   Radio France Internationale, citing diplomatic sources, said twopayments had been made and the French government will sign a checkfor $400 million in the next few days.   Interior Minister Charles Pasqua vigorously denied Thursday thatFrance paid a ransom.   Adham said French President Francois Mitterrand asked him tomediate in March 1986, and gave him a letter for President HafezAssad of Syria.   Adham said he contacted Assad about 10 times in two years andasked the Syrian leader to pass messages to Iran, which wasbelieved to have influence over the kidnappers.   Adham said he most recently traveled to Damascus, the Syriancapital, on March 9 as part of an official French delegationincluding negotiator Jean-Charles Marchiani, Pasqua's personalrepresentative.   Prior to his expulsion, Adham lived in Paris for 11 years withhis French wife and four children.   He charged Prime Minister Jacques Chirac ordered him to leave inorder to monopolize credit for the release of the three hostages,held since 1985. Chirac is a candidate for the French presidency ina runoff election on Sunday.   In Paris, Arab diplomatic and French government sources havesaid that Pasqua, who is close to Chirac, was annoyed by Adham'sstatements to the media about an imminent release of the threehostages just before the first round of the presidential electionsApril 24.   Adham said the French government wanted to ``divert all creditfrom me.'' ``They are seeking maximum advantage from the hostageaffair. They knew on Tuesday that the liberation was nearly athand,'' he said.   He said he drew no material benefit from his missions.   ``I don't need the French government financially because I havegood business all over the world. I can live wherever I want,'' headded.   But he said lawyers are challenging the expulsion and he expectsto return to Paris.</TEXT></DOC>
