(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A panel of 12 churchgoers was selected totry Jim Bakker while the PTL founder's wife pleaded on the couple'stelevision show for money from the faithful.   The jury selected Monday includes Baptists, Presbyterians andCatholics, most of whom said they attend church regularly and giveto their church, but do not watch PTL or other religious televisionprograms.   ``Our faith is in God,'' Bakker proclaimed as he strode into theU.S. District Courthouse with his attorneys and daughter.   Back in Orlando, Fla., Bakker's wife, Tammy Faye, carried ontheir live television broadcast, urging viewers to send money andpray for her husband.   ``Everything that has to do with Christian television is on trialwhen Jim walks in that courtroom,'' she said shortly after the ``Jimand Tammy Show'' opened Monday morning.   Bakker, who has pleaded innocent, is charged with eight counts ofmail fraud, 15 counts of wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit mailand wire fraud. If convicted on all counts, he could face 120 yearsin prison and $5 million in fines.   Earlier this month, former PTL Executive Vice President RichardDortch, who was indicted with Bakker, pleaded guilty to charges offraud and conspiracy. Last month, former Bakker aides James andDavid Taggart were convicted of tax evasion. All three are potentialgovernment witnesses.   In jury selection Monday, U.S. District Court Judge Robert Potterquestioned 49 people about their religious affiliation, whether theyhad ever donated to television evangelists, how regularly theyattended church and whether they had ever been ``born again,'' had adeep religious experience or felt they had been called by God into avocation.   Seven jurors were dismissed, including four who said they couldnot put aside their opinions to give Bakker a fair trial.   Potter warned the jurors not to discuss the case with anyonebefore opening arguments begin next Monday. Prosecutors and defenseattorneys are under a gag order imposed by Potter, and would notdiscuss jury selection.   Bakker left by a side door after jury selection was completed.   Besides the Taggarts and Dortch, Potter said the potentialwitnesses at the trial included several former PTL board members,including actor Efrem Zimbalist Jr. and Charles Cookman, theAssemblies of God superintendent from Dunn, N.C.   Mrs. Bakker was listed as a possible defense witness.   Jessica Hahn, whom PTL paid money to stay quiet about a sexualencounter with Bakker, and Virginia evangelist Jerry Falwell, whotook over the PTL empire in Fort Mill, S.C., after Bakker quit inMarch 1987, were not mentioned as possible witnesses.   Bakker and his attorneys have declined to discuss their defensestrategy, but he has said he knew little about PTL's finances.   Mrs. Bakker stayed in Orlando, where Bakker transplanted hisministry, to carry on their daily live broadcast.   ``We need you to really pray for him,'' a tearful Mrs. Bakkertold viewers.   The Bakkers have pleaded with supporters to contribute $1 millionfor Bakker's defense fund. A letter sent two months ago said half ofthat amount had to be raised by the end of the month.   Ministry officials have declined to say how much has been raised.   It was earlier appeals for $1,000 donations to buy ``lifetimepartnerships'' at the PTL ministry that landed Bakker in federalcourt.   Prosecutors say he and top aides at the Heritage USA ministrydiverted more than $4 million of the $158 million contributed undervarious partnership programs to their personal uses.   The Bakkers lived in a $1.3 million parsonage in Tega Cay, S.C.,where they had an air-conditioned dog house. Their condo in Floridahad gold-plated faucets and mirrored walls that would give a view ofthe ocean from all directions.</TEXT></DOC>
