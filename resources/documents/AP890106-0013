It was a back-to-basics speech Wednesday, with strong attacks onthe Reagan administration and ringing praise for the Soviet Unionand Cubans for sacrifices made in the building of socialism.   As Castro described it, the revolution has turned a corner. Twoyears ago, the Cuban leader was unhappy with evidence of lazinessand corruption, but on Wednesday night, before tens of thousands ofpeople, he said he detected a new spirit of dedication.   Those honored at the ceremony included eight workers who Castrosaid contributed thousands of hours of volunteer work for a hugeexhibit of the revolution's achievements in social and economicdevelopment.   One the workers had been known to work 30 hours at a stretch,Castro said. His colleages wanted him to go home, but ``who wasgoing to stop him?'' the president asked.   The exhibit, known as ``Expocuba,'' opened Thursday with 45pavilions focusing on Cuban innovations in science, technology andother fields.   ``We respect the paths others take in the construction ofsocialism,'' Castro said, seemingly dismissing as inconsequentialthe deepening contrasts between the Cuban and Soviet systems.   His prior criticism of liberal reforms introduced by SovietPresident Mikhail S. Gorbachev had touched off speculation about apossible loosening of ties between the two countries.   But Castro went out of his way to praise Soviet policies ondetente and disarmament and said the two countries see eye-to-eye onthe international debt and trade.   ``We will never forget the (Soviet) support received in decisivemoments,'' he said.   In the past year and a half, there has been modest improvement inU.S. relations with Cuba, but on Wednesday night the Cuban leadersounded much like the Castro of old in his remarks about the UnitedStates.   A slight chill fell over the crowd when Castro touched on thissubject. It was near the end of his nearly three-hour oration, andwith dusk long past, many in the audience huddled together forwarmth.   Curiously, Castro omitted criticism of the U.S. downing of twoLibyan fighter planes Wednesday over the Mediterranean. But heassailed the Reagan administration's threats to destroy a Libyanplant the United States says is intended to produce chemical weapons.   It was shortly after this that the chief U.S. representative inCuba, Jay Taylor, rose from his seat in the diplomatic section andwalked out.   Castro warned that the United States may be embarked on a policyof aggression against Third World countries under the cover ofdetente with Moscow.   He also indicated it may be time to reform the United Nations todilute the power of the five members of the Security Council, whoeach have veto power. The five are the United States, the SovietUnion, China, Britain and France.   It is unjust for Britain, a country of 50 million, to have vetopower while no such authority is given India, which has 880 millionpeople, Castro said.   He said 4 billion people live in the Third World but the currentU.N. structure leaves power in the hands of countries that representa minority of the global population.   Castro mentioned the U.N. issue in expressing concern over aU.S.-led move in the Security Council to reduce, because offinancial considerations, the number of U.N. forces who will overseethe transition in Namibia to independence from South Africa.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   George Gedda, a diplomatic correspondent based inWashington, has visited Cuba 15 times since 1974.</TEXT></DOC>
