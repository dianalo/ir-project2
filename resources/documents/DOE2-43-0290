<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-43-0290 </DOCNO><TEXT>An account is given of selected methods for the measurement and characterizationof spatial and temporal noise in staring focal plane arrays (FPAs), inorder to demonstrate how these results can be used in simulations andanalytic models to predict the performance of selected staring sensors.Attention is given to MIR FPAs applicable to the detection and trackingof point sources, and to the ways in which these spatial and temporalnoise measurements can be incorporated into simulations and sensors havingstaring FPAs. Methods for predicting the performance of selected staringsensor systems are derivable from spatial and temporal noise values.13 references.</TEXT></DOC>
