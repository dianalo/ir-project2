The plans were adopted late Saturday at a closed session of thelargest anti-apartheid conference ever held in South Africa. It wasattended by 4,662 black, white, Indian and mixed-race delegatesfrom 2,128 organizations.   Several major black organizations to the left and right ofmainstream anti-apartheid groups either boycotted the conference orwere not invited.   But Murphy Morobe, one the organizers, said the Conference for aDemocratic Future was a ``roaring success.''   ``Business was concluded in a spirit of unity unprecedented inany gathering in the past with such a disparate array oforganizations,' he said at a news conference.   One resolution urged whites ``to break decisively with allapartheid forces and side with the majority.'' It urged them toconduct solidarity marches into black townships and proposed acampaign to create new municipalities by merging white cities andtheir adjoining black ghettos.   Another resolution urged an escalation of confrontationalactivity by black trade unions. It said workers should be preparedto occupy the Johannesburg Stock Exchange if necessary to preventpossible privatization of major state enterprises such as thepostal and transport services.   ``We call upon our people to reject capitalism and free marketsystem,'' a resolution on economics said.   Perhaps the most important resolution, Morobe said, was a demandfor non-racial elections for an assembly that would draft aconstitution establishing a one-person, one-vote system for SouthAfrica.   President F.W. de Klerk has rejected the concept of such anassembly. He has offered to negotiate a new constitution that wouldextend limited political rights to the black majority of 28million, but he wants black negotiators chosen in segregatedelections.   Since taking power in August, de Klerk has made severalconciliatory moves aimed at promoting negotiations between blacksand the nation's 5 million whites, who control the government andthe economy. He has freed some prominent political prisoners,prohibited segregation of beaches, and permitted previously bannedopposition activities, including meetings like the conference.   However, delegates adopted a resolution saying de Klerk'sproposals were ``designed to enmesh our organizations and people inschemes to maintain the status quo.''   ``The conference ... took the view that President de Klerk'sreform initiatives are devoid of substance,'' Morobe said.   Other resolutions urged parents and students to defy schoolsegregation policies, demanded land redistribution and urged youngwhite men to refuse mandatory military service. Delegates alsodemanded appointment of an independent commission to investigateallegations that police death squads have killed governmentopponents.   Another resolution demanded an end to the state of emergencyimposed in June 1986. Many delegates belong to groups restricted byemergency regulations.   Most delegates were aligned to some degree with the outlawedAfrican National Congress guerrilla movement and affiliated groupsin South Africa.   The most notable absentees were Inkatha, a relativelyconservative Zulu organization opposed to the ANC's militanttactics, and so-called Africanist groups, which oppose the ANC'sphilosophy of non-racism.   Although black unity remains elusive, Morobe said the conference``far surpassed our expectations.''   ``A firm basis was established for the political direction ofall anti-apartheid forces well into the 1990s, the decade of thefinal onslaught against apartheid,'' he said.   Observers from 19 countries attended the conference andorganizers said funding was provided by the Dutch government andchurch groups from Denmark, Norway and Sweden. They said theCanadian government had offered to finance regional follow-upmeetings.</TEXT></DOC>
