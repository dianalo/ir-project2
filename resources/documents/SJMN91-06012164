Ordinarily, that would mean that it's a greattime for homeowners to refinance their loans.;    But these are not ordinarytimes, and homeowners thinking of refinancing have found themselves in aquandary.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Home  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  FALLING RATES MAKE IT TEMPTING TO REFINANCE  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Are home equity credit lines a good deal for you? Page 20D  </MEMO><TEXT>     First, most economists expect mortgage rates to drop another half point orso over the next several months. So you might save some money if you delayyour refinancing until the spring.;    But muddying the upbeat outlook forinterest rates is the prospect of war in the Persian Gulf. If war breaks outand oil prices skyrocket, inflation will undoubtedly heat up and push interestrates higher -- meaning that people who don't refinance now would have toaccept a higher rate later.;    &quot;I think that we could see rates drop to 9percent by the spring, mostly because oil prices are dropping and the economyis soft,&quot; said John Tuccillo, chief economist of the National Association ofRealtors. &quot;But if a shooting war erupts in the gulf, all bets are off.&quot;;   There is even a new twist to the old rule of thumb that says it makes sense torefinance if the rate you would get on your new loan is at least two pointslower than the rate you pay on your current mortgage.;    &quot;If you think thesoft economy might cost you your job but you've got a comfortable amount ofsavings in the bank, it would probably be safe for you to go ahead andrefinance if you find an attractive loan,&quot; said Robert Van Order, chiefeconomist of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.;    &quot;But if you don't havemuch in the way of savings and the up-front costs of the new loan would eat upmost of your cash reserves, you might want to delay refinancing until you're alittle more certain about the future of your job,&quot; he said.;    &quot;If you getthrown out of work, you'll need some money in the bank to tide you over untilyou find a new job.&quot;;    Van Order said that much of the refinancing occurringtoday is being done by homeowners who are trading in their adjustable-ratemortgages for fixed-rate loans -- even if the rate on their new loan is lessthan two points below that of the loan they currently have.;    &quot;A lot ofpeople have ARMs with a rate of around 10 1/2 percent, and they are tradingthem in for a 9 1/2 percent fixed-rate loan,&quot; he said. &quot;Even though theyaren't reducing their monthly payments by much, they're eliminating the riskthat's inherent with any ARM -- that their rate might eventually be adjustedupward.&quot;;    In fact, even people who recently purchased a house with an ARMwith a low introductory rate might want to consider refinancing with afixed-rate loan.;    For example, say you bought a house eight months ago withan ARM that started out with an 8 percent &quot;teaser&quot; rate. It is due to beadjusted to market rate at the end of your first year, which is only fourmonths away.;    When the rate is adjusted and the lender adds its margin, or&quot;markup,&quot; your new rate will probably top 10 percent. So it might be a wiseidea to refinance now with a fixed-rate loan at today's 9 1/2 percent ratebecause the money you'll save in the second year of the loan will easilyoffset the money you'll lose by giving up the remaining four months you haveat the 8 percent rate.;    Of course, a key factor in determining whether youshould refinance is the length of time you expect to stay in your home.;   &quot;It wouldn't make sense to spend several thousand dollars in up-front fees torefinance if you're going to move in a year or two,&quot; Van Order said. &quot;You'dprobably have to stay in the house for at least three years before the monthlysavings you'd realize from a lower-rate loan would offset the fees you'll haveto pay to set the new loan up.&quot;;    If you decide to refinance, economistTuccillo suggests you ask your lender for a &quot;lock-in&quot; clause guaranteeing thatthe rate you're quoted today is the rate you'll actually get when the loan iseventually funded.;    That way, you won't have to worry if war breaks out andrates soar, because you'll have the lender's written promise to give you therate you were originally quoted.;    If you are willing to gamble, though,delaying the refinance might pay handsome dividends.;    &quot;The long-term trendin interest rates is definitely downward,&quot; said Gary Schlossberg, senioreconomist of Wells Fargo Bank.;    &quot;Even if war breaks out, rates will spikeupward for a little while and then resume their descent. So, there's really noreason to rush out and refinance now -- you might be able to get a lower ratelater.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  DAVID W.
