Poindexter was ``the only one ... who didn't hang Ollie Northout to dry'' during the congressional Iran-Contra hearings, Northsaid at a pre-trial hearing in the case against the former nationalsecurity adviser.   Poindexter is charged with conspiracy, two counts of obstructingCongress and two counts of making false statements in theIran-Contra affair.   North, in seven hours of testimony over two days, said hisperceptions of the Iran-Contra affair had been influenced byPoindexter's Capitol Hill testimony, given under a grant ofimmunity. If U.S. District Judge Harold Greene agrees, North couldbe barred from testifying.   Defense lawyer Richard Beckler and Greene pressed the formerWhite House aide to provide specifics on how Poindexter's testimonytainted his perceptions.   ``I'm telling you I can't,'' North said, making it clear hewould prefer not to testify at Poindexter's trial, scheduled tobegin Jan. 22.   ``I hoped I would never set foot in a courtroom ever again,''North said when asked why he hadn't reviewed his trial testimony inmore detail before coming to court this week.   ``This is the fourth Christmas that my family has had its doordarkened'' by the independent counsel's investigation andprosecution of the Iran-Contra affair, North said.   The former Marine lieutenant colonel was convicted in May ofthree felonies in connection with the arms-for-hostages deal. He isappealing that conviction.   Greene said North ``is not a friendly witness, not to theindependent counsel. He may be (friendly) to the defense, but wedon't know that either.''   Beckler will file court papers specifying instances in whichNorth gave different testimony or more detailed testimony at hisApril trial compared with his 1987 congressional testimony. North'scongressional appearance preceded Poindexter's nationally televisedtestimony.   Questioning North closely, Beckler did bring out that hisrecollection was affected by Poindexter's testimony in connectionwith Poindexter tearing up a politically embarrassing policystatement that depicted the Reagan administration's Iran initiativeas a straight arms-for-hostages deal.   North said his memory of the event was colored by the fact thatPoindexter acknowledged in his congressional testimony that he haddestroyed the presidential document, known as a ``finding,'' Nov.20, 1986, amid public scrutiny of the administration's arms salesto Iran.   The presidential finding ``could have been any sheet of paperbut for the fact that'' Poindexter ``confirmed it'' in hiscongressional testimony, North told Beckler.   ``I don't know for a fact ... that the document destroyed thatmorning was the finding,'' North said later when questioned byprosecutor Michael Bromwich.   North testified at his own trial that he watched Poindexter ripup the document as then-Attorney General Edwin Meese III beganfocusing on a November 1985 CIA-assisted shipment of Hawkanti-aircraft missiles to Iran.   On Wednesday, however, North said that he hadn't actually readthe document when Poindexter destroyed it.   The destruction of the finding relates to four of the criminalcharges against Poindexter, accused of falsely telling Congressthat he didn't learn of the missile shipment to Iran until January1986.   The finding, signed by President Reagan in December 1985, wasdrafted because of the CIA-assisted shipment the previous month.</TEXT></DOC>
