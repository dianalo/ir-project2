These distinctions are crucial to the historical American genius in assimilating ethnic groups, in which quotas were anathema and the &quot;the balanced ticket&quot; was apple pie. We hope to return to this in another context.    For the moment, we note that our friend Mike Kinsley agrees that &quot;minority set-asides&quot; are inappropriate, having earlier conceded that it was entirely appropriate to consider William Lucas's black experience as a qualification to be assistant attorney general for civil rights. Which leaves us to wonder why Mr. Kinsley picked this fight with us. How can anyone witness the mugging of Mr. Lucas by Senators Kennedy, Biden and Metzenbaum and conclude that what needs comment is the &quot;dishonest ambivalence&quot; of Mr. Lucas's defenders. </TEXT></DOC>
