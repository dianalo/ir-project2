They now appear to lean towarderadicating Iraq's military machine, which would probably entail the fall ofSaddam's Baath Socialist government.;    Ghali said a change of government inIraq must reflect the free will of the Iraqi people, adding that it was in thebest interest of the Arab world to have a strong Iraq with a strong military,provided it did not commit acts of aggression against other Arab countries.;   The remarks by Ghali coincided with a sudden trip to the United States byEgyptian Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid.;    In Washington, Abdel-Meguidis expected to press Cairo's demands for increased financial aid from theWestern alliance and greater debt relief for the Egyptian economy because ofthe gulf crisis, which the government says has cost Egypt more than $12billion in lost revenues.;    Egypt already has had its military debts to theUnited States forgiven, as well as its debts to Arab nations, with a total $14billion written off. But it continues to owe $35 billion to industrializedcountries.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  New York Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Cairo, Egypt  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910128  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  10A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  413  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday January 28, 199100028008,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
