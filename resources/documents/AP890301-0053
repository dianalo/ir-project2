Police seized the dissidents after a six-hour standoff on themain highway from Seoul to the Panmunjom border truce site. Theyforced their way onto the dissidents' bus and took them to a nearbypolice station.   ``Get away, get away,'' some of the dissidents shouted as theywere taken off the bus at the station. Dissident leader Lee Jae-ohand some other protesters kicked and punched police trying to takethem away.   The radical United National Democratic Movement of Korea had sentdelegates to try and reach the border truce site for talks withNorth Korean officials on reuniting the peninsula that has beendivided since 1945.   North Korean radio, in a report monitored in Tokyo, said itsdelegates waited at Panmunjom for two hours for the dissidents. Itaccused the South Korean and U.S. governments of blockingreunification.   ``Indiscriminate violence by the South Korean rulers ... at theU.S. imperialists' instigation, is unbearable, undemocratic and anact counter to unification,'' the radio said.   South and North Korean officials are to meet Thursday atPanmunjom to try and work out terms for a meeting between theirprime ministers _ which would be the highest level contact everbetween the two Koreas.   Dissident leaders reject the Seoul government's efforts to easetension with the north and earlier announced plans to conduct theirown talks. North Korea backed the dissidents in an apparent move toembarass Seoul.   Lines of riot police with shields blocked the main highway fromSeoul today when the dissidents' bus reached the Naeyu checkpoint 12miles from the border.   Troopers with shields immediately surrounded the bus to stopdissidents from getting off and the protesters stayed aboard forabout six hours, partly blocking the highway.   Angry dissident leaders, leaning from the bus windows, repeatedlydenounced the United States, charging that Washington keeps troopsin the south to prop up the Seoul government and perpetuate divisionof the peninsula.   ``Withdraw Americans blocking unification,'' the dissidentschanted.   A dissident leader read a statement denouncing South KoreanPresident Roh Tae-woo's government and charging that it does notwant union with the north.   Roh has been holding talks with North Korea on improvingrelations as part of a major initiative to reduce tensions on thepeninsula.   ``The government and the U.S.A., if they really want peacefulunification of the nation, should not use force in blocking us,''the dissident spokesman said.   South Korean dissidents are demanding immediate reunificationwith the communist north, claiming all the south's politicalproblems stem from the peninsula's division.   In Seoul today, Roh delivered one of his strongest warnings yetto radicals and dissidents saying South Korea can no longer tolerateattempts to overthrow its democratic system.   ``We have reached a stage where we can no longer tolerateattempts to topple the government through class revolution,'' hesaid in a speech marking the 70th anniversary of a nationwideuprising against Japanese colonial rule.   ``All of us who share responsibility in this land must take aclear-cut attitude toward anti-democracy groups that shake our freesociety from its very foundation,'' he said.   Dissidents were blocked Tuesday near the Panmunjom border sitewhen they tried to meet with North Korean officials to makearrangements for today's planned meeting. U.S. military borderguards were involved in the scuffle.   The United States has about 42,000 troops in South Korea under amutual defense treaty.</TEXT></DOC>
