The attack was the fifth on tourists in Kenyan game parks inless than a year.   The group of 19 Americans was attacked Thursday as they drove inthree vans along a 40-mile road between Amboseli and Tsavo nationalparks in southern Kenya.   ``They just jumped out in the road and fired on us,'' Allen E.Sullivan, 66, was quoted as saying in a telephone interview withConnecticut's Hartford Courant newspaper.   Sullivan, a retired high school teacher from Trumbull, Conn.,was shot in the chest but the newspaper quoted him as saying he wasnot badly hurt. He spoke from his hotel in Nairobi.   A woman was shot through the head and killed instantly. InWashington, State Department spokeswoman Frances Jones identifiedher as Marie Esther Ferraro of New Haven, Conn. Her age was notavailable.   Sullivan was quoted as saying that two men, one dressed incamouflage clothing, jumped out of the bush about midday and beganfiring at their convoy of three vans. The gunmen stole money andjewelry from them, he said. Sources said the gunmen usedSoviet-made AK-47 assault rifles.   They were on a trip organized by the Connecticut Audubon Societyand had 18 people from Connecticut and one from Georgia, societyspokeswoman Lauren Brown said in Fairfield, Conn.   Kenyan Police Commissioner Philip Kilonzo and Richard Leakey,director of wildlife, went to the scene to investigate.   It was the fifth attack in 11 months on tourists in Kenyan gameparks.   They began in September when a Dutch tourist was shot in thechest in Meru National Park.   Also in September, the remains of a British woman were found insprawling Masai Mara Game Reserve in southwestern Kenya. An inquestbegins Aug. 7 into her death, which her father says was murder.Police say she could have fallen prey to wild animals.   In the first week of July, poachers shot two French tourists todeath in Meru National Park, east of Mount Kenya. Leakey had calledit an isolated incident. He said he did not think the poachers were``looking for tourists to shoot.''   In April, three West German tourists were wounded by gunmen whoambushed their vehicles in about the same spot between Tsavo andAmboseli.   Two Americans remain hospitalized after being beaten up lastweek while on a horseback riding safari in Masai Mara. The U.S.Embassy refused to release details about them.   Maintaining security in Kenya's parks is vital to this EastAfrican nation, which has hosted nearly 3 million tourists since1984. Tourism last year brought in nearly $350 million and becameKenya's top foreign exchange earner after coffee.   After the French couple was killed, the government said itincreased security to ensure national parks and game reserves are``peaceful and comfortable havens'' and make sure the wildlifesurvive.   Kenya has suffered increasingly from well-armed poachers whostalk and kill elephants for their valuable ivory tusks, primarilyin Tsavo.   Since Leakey became wildlife director in March, Kenya hasstepped up anti-poaching efforts. Since January, game rangers havekilled more than 20 poachers.</TEXT></DOC>
