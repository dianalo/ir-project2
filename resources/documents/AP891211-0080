RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court today limited the waymultinational corporations can use foreign tax laws to reduce theirU.S. taxes, a ruling the Bush administration said may save thegovernment hundreds of millions of dollars.   The court ruled unanimously against Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co.in a case stemming from operations of Goodyear's British subsidiaryin the early 1970s.   The British subsidiary of the Ohio-based corporation incurrednet losses in 1972 and 1973, at least under British tax law. Thesubsidiary's 1973 loss included British tax deductions that werenot allowed under American law.   As a result, the British government refunded to the subsidiarytax payments made there for 1970 and 1971.   The refunds prompted the U.S. Internal Revenue Service torecompute the taxes it said Goodyear owed in this country.   Multinationals are entitled to claim a share of taxes paid bysubsidiaries overseas as credits against U.S. taxes.   In Goodyear's case, since the IRS said American law did notrecognize the 1973 deductions permitted the company in GreatBritain, the corporation's loss was converted into a profit.   The redetermination had the further effect of wiping out, forU.S. tax purposes, the foreign tax credits previously allowedGoodyear in 1970 and 1971.   As a result, the IRS assessed Goodyear $791,240 in taxes andinterest for 1970 and 1971.   Goodyear then filed suit in the U.S. Claims Court, saying theIRS erred in applying American law instead of British law todetermine the company's accumulated profits.   The claims court ruled against Goodyear. But a federal appealscourt here reversed the decision last year.   The appeals court said a multinational company is entitled touse a foreign nation's tax laws to determine accumulated profitsmade by a subsidiary in that country.   The Supreme Court today overruled the appeals court.   Justice Thurgood Marshall, in his opinion for the high court,said the approach favored by Goodyear would lead to unequal taxtreatment for subsidiaries _ as opposed to companies set up asforeign branches of U.S. corporations _ whenever a foreigngovernment calculates income differently than in this country.   That result would not square with federal laws aimed at assuringtax parity between corporations that operate through foreignsubsidiaries and those that operate through foreign branches,Marshall said.   The Justice Department said hundreds of millions of dollars areat stake, even though U.S. tax law was changed in 1986 to barmultinationals from using a foreign country's calculation of itsaccumulated profits for most future tax payments here.   The department said more than 25,000 foreign subsidiaries ofU.S. companies do business in more than 100 countries. Thegovernment's most recent figures show the companies claimed morethan $9 billion in foreign tax credits in 1982.   The IRS said it is reviewing claims for $150 million in refundsin such cases.   The case is U.S. vs. Goodyear, 88-1474.</TEXT></DOC>
