Blue-chip issues were able to recoup most of their early losses fairly quickly, but the broader market followed suit only in the final minutes of the session. Traders attributed the lackluster performance to a loss of enthusiasm for takeover-related stocks.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which dropped more than 15 points early in the session as the dollar fell below the 125-yen level for the first time since June, closed with a loss of just 1.24 at 2148.65.    Broader market averages, which also fell sharply in early trading, rebounded to finish higher. Standard andamp; Poor's 500-Stock Index went up 0.44 to 278.97, the Dow Jones Equity Market Index rose 0.35 to 261.99 and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index added 0.15 to 156.94.    Declining issues on the Big Board remained far ahead of advancers for most of the session, but a late round of buying narrowed the gap to a 749-to-702 margin.    Only 143,460,000 shares changed hands in Big Board trading. Volume reverted to the sluggish pace of recent months after its recent acceleration tied to speculation about possible takeovers and leveraged buy-outs.    With concerns about the prospects for those deals weighing on the market, stock prices were largely influenced by movements in the dollar, traders said. The market's recovery followed a rebound in the U.S. currency, sparked by reports that the Federal Reserve had intervened in the foreign-exchange markets on its behalf.    Peter Canelo, a market strategist at Bear, Stearns andamp; Co., said a reversal of the dollar's recent downturn is necessary for stocks to move higher before next Tuesday's presidential election.    Mr. Canelo asserted that there is &quot;a good chance&quot; for the Dow Jones industrials to move beyond 2200 over the next few sessions if bond prices extend their latest rally, which will require a turnaround in the U.S. currency.    But the consensus view among analysts and traders is that the market has entered a holding pattern and will remain there until the election has passed. &quot;I don't think there are going to be any major decisions made between now and election time,&quot; said Edward E. Collins III, executive vice president of institutional trading at Daiwa Securities America.    Brian Luedtke, a technical analyst at Piper, Jaffray andamp; Hopwood, Minneapolis, said prices may remain locked in a narrow trading range even after the election, given the level of uncertainty about the prospects for both the market and the economy.    At the moment, the market is suffering from a loss of upward momentum after rallying to the best levels since last October's crash, Mr. Luedtke said. &quot;That doesn't mean it necessarily has to go through a severe jolt,&quot; he said, but it does suggest that stocks are likely to need time to consolidate after their recent rally.    Mr. Canelo said &quot;a two-tier market of tremendous proportions&quot; has developed since mid-year, with consumer-related stocks reaping the benefits of takeover and buy-out offers while industrial issues languish.    He suggested that it may be time for investors to consider selling consumer issues during any periods of strength and shifting back into the industrial sector, given the risks that could result from the amount of debt associated with the takeovers.    Sears Roebuck dropped 1 7/8 to 41 3/4 amid disappointment over its plans to repurchase about 10% of its stock by mid-1989, sell its headquarters building and other assets and transform its merchandising subsidiary into an &quot;everyday low price&quot; operation. The plan, which also involves cost-cutting measures, will result in a $425 million charge in the fourth quarter. Although the company had recently been cited as a possible takeover candidate, Chairman Edward A. Brennan said Sears hadn't received any takeover or leveraged buy-out offers.    Kraft jumped 7 to 103 1/2 in Big Board composite trading of 4.6 million shares in the wake of its agreement to be acquired by Philip Morris for $106 a share, or $12.9 billion, in the most expensive non-oil takeover on record. Philip Morris, which will become the largest consumer products company in the world upon completion of the transaction, gained 5/8 to 95 3/8. Elsewhere on the takeover front, RJR Nabisco dropped 1 1/4 to 83 3/4 in composite trading of 4.6 million shares and Pillsbury went up 1/2 to 60 as 1.7 million shares changed hands.    Whittaker jumped 6 5/8 to 41 1/2 as Caiola Associates, which holds a 4.9% stake in the company, offered to acquire the rest for $47.50 a share. The company said Caiola's proposal was &quot;highly conditional,&quot; but didn't elaborate.    Lubrizol, which agreed to settle its patent-infringement suit against Exxon for less than had been expected, slid 1 7/8 to 37. Under the settlement, Exxon agreed to pay $80 million in cash and $6 million in trade credits.    Reynolds Metals fell 1 3/4 to 55. Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette downgraded the stock, and the firm's metals analyst told the Dow Jones Professional Investor Report the value of the company's Australian gold interests has &quot;eroded&quot; in the past six to 12 months.    Stride Rite lost 1 5/8 to 31 5/8. The company said it plans a charge of 20 cents a share in the year ending Dec. 2 for the phaseout of its Overland Trading chain of shoe stores.    Veeco Instruments gained 1 1/2 to 20 amid the resurfacing of takeover rumors that have periodically boosted the stock since June. Two analysts said they hadn't heard any new speculation on the company.    Arrow Electronics went up 7/8 to 6 5/8. George Batchelor and Ira Sochet, two investors who together hold 12% of the company's common shares, said they might seek to boost their stake through a tender offer or wage a proxy fight for seats on the company's board.    Wedgestone Financial, which suspended its dividend, plunged 2 7/8 to 4. The company posted a third-quarter loss of $3.6 million, compared with year-ago net income of $2.8 million, or 48 cents a share.    The American Stock Exchange Index slid 0.80 to 300.95. Volume totaled 8,000,000 shares.    Horn andamp; Hardart jumped 3/4 to 9 3/8 on heavy volume. New York-based Automatic Partners said it has acquired a 6.9% stake in the company and may seek control.    DWG added 1/2 to 7 1/4. A group including Michael H. Steinhardt, who runs the New York-based money management firm of Steinhardt Partners, has acquired a 5.9% stake in the company.    Metex Corp. gained 1 to 11 1/8. Barron's reported that the company has a book value of $15 a share, well above the $12-a-share equivalent of Metropolitan Consolidated Industries' stock offer for the company.    Catalina Lighting dropped 5/8 to 8 3/8. The underwriter who brought Catalina public in May said that the drop in price is due to a 5,000-share sell order that apparently set off a series of stop-loss orders.    University Bank slid 3/8 to 3 1/4 after reporting third-quarter earnings of six cents a share, compared with 14 cents a year ago. </TEXT></DOC>
