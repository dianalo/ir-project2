Now Mamo, like many of Israel's 16,500 Ethiopian Jewishimmigrants, feels disillusioned and alienated in a country wherequiet, traditional Africans don't quite fit in.   Their primitive farming methods are not needed, their lack ofsophistication is a cause for condescension, and their skin coloris sometimes a target of discrimination.   Even their Jewish faith has been questioned.   The Ethiopians' disappointment is all the greater because oftheir harsh struggle to emigrate and their dramatic arrival fromSudan in the secret ``Operation Moses'' airlift, for which theUnited States provided planes and pilots; the operation wasoverseen by George Bush, then Ronald Reagan's vice president.   Mamo's road to Israel was harder than most.   After leaving his village in 1984, he was detained byanti-government Ethiopian rebels for one month. They beat his wifeand stole his money.   Let go, the family joined 150 other emigrants in walking toSudan. It took a month, and without adequate food and water their2-year-old daughter died, one of 10 who perished en route.   In Sudan, 25 more of the group died because of malnutrition anddisease, including Mamo's aunt, uncle and three nephews.   ``We had faith in the Holy One, blessed be He, that despite thesuffering, He was with us,'' Mamo said through an interpreter inhis native Amharic at his apartment in the southern coastal city ofAshkelon.   As he walked through the desert, Mamo said, he ``thought aboutthe Israel of my dreams. All would be bright and wonderful. Even atnight there would be sunshine, after we gathered in from theexile.''   Five years since the exodus, almost 30 percent of Ethiopiansstill live in dormitory-style government housing centers. TheNational Council for Ethiopian Jews says unemployment among theEthiopian immigrants above age 35 is about 45 percent.   Mamo, 54, lives in a small government-supplied apartment withhis wife and four of his chidren. He has no job, partly because heacquired a blood disease from drinking polluted water on the trekto Sudan and cannot do heavy work.   The apartment complex where he lives is filled with almost 2,000Ethiopian immigrants and is disparagingly called the ``EthiopianGhetto'' by unsympathetic neighbors.   Israel officials say they are making progress in settling thenew immigrants. The children have proven able to quickly adapt tothe new culture, with more than 400 Ethiopians enrolled in Israeliuniversities and many others serving in elite army units.   But officials concede the newest immigrants had moredifficulties than any of the Jewish communities that came fromEurope, the Middle East and North Africa as part of thein-gathering that began after the creation of Israel as a nation in1948.   ``Most new immigrants spoke French or English and they had someskills,'' said Uri Gordon, director of immigration and absorptionin the Jewish Agency. ``With the Ethiopians we had to start anew.''   He said Ethiopian immigrants are given intensive Hebrew classesand provided social workers to help them acclimate.   The three-month ``Operation Moses'' airlift in 1984 brought morethan 8,000 Ethiopian Jews to Israel, joining others who managed toflee earlier.   The new Ethiopian immigrants, many villagers who spoke onlyAmharic, found themselves shunted aside in a society known for its``chutzpah,'' a Hebrew word meaning audacious to the point ofrudeness.   ``We left our culture and came here where they don't speak ourlanguage or follow our customs, and now we find ourselves in poorjobs and gaining little respect,'' said Mesfin Ambau, director ofthe Jerusalem-based Organization of Ethiopian Immigrants. ``Thereis a lot of pain inside.''   The Ethiopians' first confrontation in Israel was with thenation's powerful rabbinate, which ruled that the community, after2,000 years of isolation from world Jewry, had deviated in itsreligious practice and needed to undergo symbolic conversions.   ``Nothing hurt us more than that,'' said Ziv Sahelev, 20, anEthiopian immigrant who lives in a government absorption center.   The Ethiopians refused any type of conversions, and therabbinate was forced to seek a compromise that quieted the dispute.   Like more than a third of the Ethiopian community, Sahalev leftbehind close relatives, in his case his father and three sisters,on the expectation that he would return and bring them to thePromised Land.   But Ethiopia's Marxist government, which has no diplomaticrelations with Israel and close relations with radical Arab states,halted the airlift shortly after it was disclosed and 15,000 Jewsremain stranded in Ethiopia.   Rahamim Elazar, director of the National Council for EthiopianJews, said Ethiopian youngsters, many separated from their parents,have a suicide rate five times higher than other Israeli teen-agers.   ``There are so many who were left behind and the children feelterribly guilty,'' he said.   Sahalev said that since he came to Israel, he has given up hopeof returning to Ethiopia to bring the rest of his family.   ``I write to them every week, and after a month or two I get ananswer,'' he said.   Another problem for the Ethiopians is that they are virtuallythe only blacks in Israel.   ``Sometimes people joke with me and point at me and startsaying, `Look, he's black,''' Sahalev said. ``It makes me feel veryuncomfortable.''   In Kiryat Chaim, a residential area of small cottages near Haifain northern Israel, neighbors rose up in protest when the JewishAgency moved four large Ethiopian families into the area's onlyapartment complex in January.   ``It's a quiet area and people came to me and complained thatthe Ethiopian children made noise at night, they didn't throw theirgarbage away,'' said Giora Fischer, district head of Kiryat Chaim.   ``In informal ways, they also made it clear to me that they felttheir property values were declining.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Mon AMs, June 12</NOTE></DOC>
