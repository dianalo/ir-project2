Sam Nunn said Monday the new U.S.-Sovietnuclear arms control treaty won't be ratified until after his ArmedServices Committee the panel finishes its line-by-line examinationof the pact.   That laborious process began Monday after the State Departmentsent the Senate 31 volumes of documents involved in the longnegotiations which led to the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces(INF) pact.   ``It is very regrettable that we have to go through this,'' saidthe Georgia Democrat, who emerged victorious in a fight with theReagan administration over the legal meaning of treaties.   Nunn, chairman of the armed services panel, said he didn't knowhow long it would take the committee to finish its work.   The panel is one of three Senate committees considering thetreaty, which was signed in December by President Reagan and Sovietleader Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Ratification by the full Senate, whichrequires a two-thirds vote, is expected later.   The INF fight was based on a previous dispute between theDemocratic-controlled Congress and the Reagan administration overthe 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty and Reagan's Star Warsanti-missile program.   A number of Star Wars tests would be banned unless the UnitedStates moved from the current ``narrow'' interpretation of the ABMtreaty to a ``broad'' view.   The Reagan administration had asserted it wasn't bound by whatprevious administrations told Congress about the meaning of the ABMpact, a view the White House at one point tried to push in theSenate debate over the INF treaty.   Nunn threatened to block the treaty until Secretary of StateGeorge P. Shultz promised last month that administration commentson the treaty were ``authoritative,'' meaning that futureadministrations couldn't try to change how the treaty is viewed.   Since Shultz's promise was delivered, ``we can now proceed,confident that the treaty the committee is being asked to approveis the same treaty'' the administration believes it negotiated,Nunn told Maynard Glitman, one of the chief negotiators for theU.S. team which worked out the treaty, during a committee meetingMonday.   The committee has sent the State Department a list of 135questions about possible ambiguities in the treaty, Nunn said. Mostare technical questions but some involve queries about possibleinterpretation of the pact, which bans missiles with ranges from300 miles to 3,400 miles.   Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, told Glitman, ``I'm sorry there was areinterpretation of the ABM treaty that made this necessary.''   ``It's sad we have to go through the exercise we're goingthrough here,'' said Sen. James Exon, D-Neb.   While the Armed Services panel was going through a detailedscrutiny of the pact, the Senate Foreign Relations Committeecontinued taking testimony from public witnesses.   Dr. Edward Teller, the physicist who is considered the father ofboth the hydrogen bomb and Reagan's Star Wars program, told theforeign relations panel he thought the fights over the meanings oftreaties were ``senseless debates.''   Teller said he supports the treaty, although he is deeplydistrustful of the Soviet Union.   Speaking of the treaty, he said, ``my personal approach iscareful, doubtful, yet positive,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
