The development of FBRs in Japan has beenadvanced independently as a national project, and the method of preventingaccidents in the actual reactors has been thoroughly taken. 'On the wayof thinking in the safety evaluation of FBRs' was decided by the NuclearSafety Commission. When the safety research from 1987 is systematized,as the constituents of safety logic, the way of thinking of the defensein depth, the way of thinking of the classification according to importance,the way of thinking of multilayer barriers against radioactive substances,and the way of thinking on severe accidents were investigated. The researchconcerning the decision of safety design and evaluation policy, and thesafety research regarding accident prevention and relaxation, accidentevaluation and severe accidents are reported.
