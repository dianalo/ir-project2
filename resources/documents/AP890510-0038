Vermont's Legislature last week enacted a bill to outlaw theregistration of cars with air conditioners usingchlorofluorocarbons beginning with the 1993 model year. Gov.Madeleine Kunin has hailed the bill and is expected to sign itwithin two weeks.   Despite years of research into a replacement coolant, thenation's Big Three automakers say they doubt they can meet thedeadline.   ``There is no way any manufacturer will be able to modify itsentire car line for Vermont in essentially three years,'' said FordMotor Co. spokeswoman Beryl Goldsweig.   Car air conditioners were singled out partly because they useCFC-12, the chlorofluorocarbon that's considered most damaging tothe ozone layer. Home refrigerators use a different type of CFC.   When CFC molecules rise into the atmosphere, they break downozone that envelops the Earth 15 to 20 miles up. Scientists saythat lets in extra solar radiation, increasing the incidence ofskin cancer and eye disease and damaging plants and animals crucialto the food chain.   Lobbyist Joan Mulhern of the Vermont Public Interest ResearchGroup has testified that car air conditioners are the nation'ssingle biggest source of ozone depletion, producing 26.6 percent ofthe CFCs released into the environment. She cited U.S.Environmental Protection Agency studies published in 1987.   One of the options available to automakers is simply not sellingcars with air conditioners in Vermont.   Although roughly 90 percent of all new cars sold nationally areequipped with air conditioning, only about half are in Vermont,said Charles Ffolliott, the state's representative of the NationalAutomotive Dealers Association. The state's average July hightemperature is a moderate 70 degrees.   For years, the automakers have had to live with stiffer tailpipeemission regulations for vehicles sold in California. But changinga car to meet those requirements is relatively simple, they say.   Ridding air conditioners of CFCs is much more complex thanmerely substituting a new coolant, the companies say.   ``The whole system has to be changed,'' said Douglas Mark, anemission engineer for General Motors Corp. ``There's got to becompressor and evaporator changes. Materials have to bere-evaluated for seals and hoses.''   Most of the research for a replacement coolant is going into asubstance labeled 134-A. It contains no CFCs but isn't as efficientas CFC-12, so air conditioners using 134-A would have to be larger.   Automakers also say they are having trouble finding a lubricantthat can stand up to 134-A, and that tests to ensure the substancecarries no health risks won't be complete in time to meet theVermont deadline.   Chrysler's Nielsen said the Vermont law, if imitated by otherstates, has the potential of slowing down work on an ozone-friendlyair conditioner.   But the automakers' protests don't bother Vermont's governor.   ``We are a role model, and we may be a role model for the U.S.Congress,'' Kunin said.   CFCs were developed as a refrigerant in 1930 by a General Motorschemist and had been considered ideal because they are non-toxicand non-combustible. They are used widely as coolants and aspropellants, such as in spray cans.   Under Vermont's bill, the sale of CFC-propelled noisemakers andplastic party streamers, as well as non-commercial ornon-industrial uses of CFCs for cleaning photographic or electronicequipment, would be banned next year.   Supporters say it is the most far-reaching of any of the twodozen ozone-protection bills introduced in state legislatures thisyear. Hawaii's legislature is the only other to have passed anozone protection measure.   Vermont's went farther than Hawaii's, which banned the releaseof CFCs from car air conditioners during repairs.</TEXT></DOC>
