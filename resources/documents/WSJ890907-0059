The penalty is believed to be the biggest environmental fine in the state's history.    The health department late last week said the Army had committed 42 violations of state toxic-waste laws. It alleged that tanks built to store the waste drained from the site are leaking.    The Army hasn't decided whether to appeal the fine, said Amy Brown, a Justice Department spokeswoman. She said the Army believes the state may be barred from penalizing the federal government under the doctrine of &quot;sovereign immunity.&quot;    At the heart of the dispute is the Army's cleanup of Basin F, a hazardous waste disposal pond located at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal. Shell Oil Co., which operated a pesticide plant on the site from 1947 to 1982, is paying part of the cleanup costs.    State officials have criticized the Army in the past for not being thorough and moving too slowly on the cleanup. In February a federal judge ruled that the state would be allowed to help supervise the project. The Army has asked the judge to reconsider the decision.    It is unusual for one government entity to fine another, said Michael R. Hope, the Colorado deputy attorney general representing the health department.    &quot;We're not trying to raid the federal treasury. We want the Army to comply with the law and we feel we have no choice but to assess penalties,&quot; Mr. Hope said.    ---TEXAS COURT RULING could make bank mergers risky.    A federal appeals court panel in New Orleans has ruled that a bank can be held liable for past crimes committed by a bank it acquires.    If the ruling stands, it is likely to complicate the process of assessing merger prospects, lawyers say. Potential criminal liabilities aren't always easy to spot. But if they aren't provided for in a merger agreement, acquiring banks could be open to litigation and fines. Lawyers for the American Bankers Association argue that the case could discourage acquisitions of failing banks. They say evidence of criminal activity often turns up in bank failures.    The court's decision involves two tiny banks. Alamo Bank of Texas had appealed its conviction for violations of the currency reporting requirements of the federal Bank Secrecy Act. The violations had been committed by Central National Bank three years before its merger into Alamo, but Alamo was indicted and convicted as a &quot;successor in interest&quot; to CNB. Last November, a U.S. district judge fined Alamo $750,000, suspending $500,000 of the fine and putting the bank on three years probation.    Alamo had argued that holding it responsible for another bank's criminal acts violated its constitutional right to due process. But the three-judge panel unanimously sided with the Justice Department in ruling against Alamo last month. It ruled that CNB continues to exist, even though it's now part of an entity named Alamo.    &quot;CNB cannot escape punishment by merging with Alamo and taking Alamo's corporate persona,&quot; the panel held.    ---   TRACKING DALLAS law-firm mergers means keeping up with the Johnsons. Johnson andamp; Gibbs, Dallas's biggest law firm with 264 lawyers, is having merger talks with Davis, Meadows, Owens, Collier andamp; Zachry, a 20-lawyer firm specializing in tax litigation and white-collar criminal defense work. Johnson andamp; Gibbs is following the lead of other big Texas firms that have acquired criminal defense expertise in the past year.    Meanwhile, 65-lawyer Johnson, Bromberg andamp; Leeds is continuing merger talks with Gardere andamp; Wynne, which will have 204 lawyers as of Oct. 1. The merger would create the biggest firm in Dallas, barely outstripping Johnson andamp; Gibbs. But Gardere andamp; Wynne managing partner Barry Drees said size isn't the motivation for the talks.    &quot;As a byproduct, it might not be all bad, but it's not a numbers race,&quot; Mr. Drees said.    ---   U.S. JUDGE APPROVES plan to settle discrimination suit against GM.    A plan unveiled in January to settle a discrimination suit brought by black salaried employees against General Motors Corp. was approved by U.S. District Judge John Feikens.    A dissident group of black employees had tried to block the settlement, claiming GM's plan didn't adequately compensate workers, but the judge rejected their efforts. The group, which has 30 days to appeal the decision, couldn't be reached for comment.    The settlement includes a commitment from GM to set up an unusual computer model to monitor personnel practices. The system will compare career advancement and the pay of blacks and whites, adjusting for factors such as education and job experience.    If the percentage of promotions or pay raises among blacks differs significantly from those among whites, GM must make up the difference based on specific formulas. Roughly 10,000 current and former black salaried employees in Michigan, Ohio and Indiana are covered by the settlement.    GM agreed to pay more than $3 million, mainly in awards and one-time salary adjustments, to about 3,800 past and present employees but didn't admit it had discriminated against them.    ---   TOP MANHATTAN PROSECUTOR: The White House, as expected, has announced President Bush's intention to nominate Otto G. Obermaier to be U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. Mr. Obermaier is a partner in Obermaier, Morvillo andamp; Abramowitz, which specializes in white-collar criminal cases. He was a prosecutor in the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office during the 1960s, and served as chief trial counsel at the Securities and Exchange Commission from 1968 to 1970. Mr. Obermaier, 53, would succeed Rudolph Giuliani, who resigned in January and is running for mayor of New York. The acting U.S. Attorney is Benito Romano.    ---   POINDEXTER PROSECUTOR NAMED: Dan Webb, a former U.S. attorney in Chicago, was named chief trial prosecutor in the government's Iran-Contra case against former National Security Adviser John Poindexter. Mr. Webb, a partner in Winston andamp; Strawn, specializes in white-collar criminal defense. Mr. Poindexter is charged with making false statements and misleading a congressional investigation. </TEXT></DOC>
