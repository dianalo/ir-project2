The purpose of this effort was to explorethe noncontacting generation of Rayleigh surface wave appropriate tothe interrogation of structures for the detection of subcritical defects,with the ultimate goal of developing an efficient laser-based nondestructiveevaluation technique utilizing flexible fiber optics.</TEXT></DOC>
