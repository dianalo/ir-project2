The acquisition of closely held Furman Selz Holding Corp. will add stock-market sales and research services to Xerox's growing array of financial wares, which include insurance, fixed-income investments, leasing and a 25% stake in a real estate concern.    Xerox Financial Services Inc., which encompasses the various operations, has been the star performer in Xerox the past year, offsetting sluggish growth in its more traditional business of photocopiers and printers. Xerox hasn't yet reported second-quarter results, but executives have given their most bullish outlook in a few years. A spokesman said yesterday that optimism hasn't changed.    Furman Selz had revenue of about $75 million last year; profit wasn't disclosed. The New York-based company has more than 200 employees, 40 of whom are the sole shareholders. It has been profitable every month this year, including April when many brokerage firms were hurt by falling stock prices, said Melvin Howard, Xerox vice chairman and chairman of the financial-services unit.    Xerox Financial Services will pay $110 million for Furman Selz out of its own resources rather than those of the parent company. The unit will pay $90 million immediately and the rest over the following two years.    Yesterday, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Xerox shares closed at $76, up 87.5 cents.    Xerox executives had decided early this year that they lacked two major financial elements -- real estate and equity investments. The company acquired a 25% stake in VMS Realty last February for the realestate piece, and two months ago approached Furman Selz to add the equity portion. The firm includes Furman Selz Mager Dietz andamp; Birney Inc. and Furman Selz Capital Management Inc.    &quot;To build it (from scratch) would have taken too much time,&quot; Mr. Howard said. Xerox's Crum andamp; Forster unit sells property and casualty insurance through agents. It has agents sell fixed-income investment packages through the Van Kampen Merritt unit. Furman sells equities to institutional investors, and Xerox may market those extra products to a broader audience through the agents that already sell its other financial products.    Xerox said Furman Selz employees won't be fired and staff won't be consolidated with the rest of the company. Though Mr. Howard said he had &quot;nothing on the table&quot; for financial acquisitions this year, he added: &quot;I wouldn't rule anything out.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
