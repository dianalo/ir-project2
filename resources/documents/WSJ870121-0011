How often, for instance, has a &quot;handyman's dream&quot; turned out to be a nightmare that only a demolition crew should tackle? Or what about the home said to be &quot;close to transportation&quot; when what's really meant is that it is next to the railroad tracks?    Real estate brokers aren't swearing off hyperbole, but some big ones are putting on television shows that are supposed to give buyers a clearer picture of homes they are selling as well as to attract new listings. The formats vary but the shows usually are broadcast on weekends and display both the interiors and exteriors of properties.    This month, Richard Schlott, whose Schlott Realtors Inc. in Wayne, N.J., is the second-largest independent broker in the nation, began airing a 13-week series of half-hour shows in the metropolitan New York area that offers views of individual homes as well as general information on everything from mortgages to home repairs.    &quot;For Sunday morning, we expect to have the top viewership with adult audiences,&quot; Mr. Schlott says. &quot;We show 30 or more homes, plus we give tips on mortgage finance and how to prepare your house for sale. This isn't just an advertisement; it's meant to build good will.&quot; He notes, though, that one house on display was sold just a few hours after the first show.    THE WASHINGTON, D.C., market has had more experience with this type of home selling. There, two brokers, Long andamp; Foster Realtors Inc. and Merrill Lynch Realty, have had Sunday morning TV shows. Long andamp; Foster began one last June at a cost of $16,000 a week, including production and air time. Half of that amount is paid by Long and Foster; sales associates of the firm who place their listings on the show pay the other half. Each program is designed to show five to seven color slides of 40 homes, each home getting about 30 seconds of air time. Last August, Long andamp; Foster started a similar show in Baltimore.    Rebecca Cox of Long andamp; Foster says the show &quot;has increased open-house traffic and name recognition for the company. We're also getting better-qualified buyers into the houses. It's a tremendous tool for our agents.&quot;    Merrill Lynch Realty's show ran for eight weeks last year but was suspended when the parent company, Merrill Lynch Inc., announced plans to sell its real estate brokerage, relocation and mortgage business. Merrill Lynch concentrated on just three or four homes per half-hour show; the balance of the program was devoted to housing-related features and to information about other Merrill Lynch services.    Linda Goldstein, Merrill Lynch Realty's marketing director, says: &quot;It's hard to say what the immediate results of the show were. Our ratings were excellent. We reached 60,000-70,000 households and were No. 1 or 2 for our time slot. Though the show was well-received, the cost of producing a show like ours was very heavy. We're still looking at whether to continue it. If we do, we'll show more listings.&quot;    OTHER REAL ESTATE BROKERS aren't exactly rushing into TV. Many say the cost of the programs far exceeds the benefits; they note that as a rule, about two-thirds of home buyers come through personal referrals.    But Joseph Hanauer, chairman and president of Coldwell Banker, the nation's biggest home broker, says his Newport Beach, Calif., company is examining the concept. &quot;Do these shows work? We're still trying to find out,&quot; he says. &quot;We've tried them in some markets, but we haven't found a great deal of evidence that they create more traffic through homes. On the other hand, there is viewer interest.&quot;    One big Washington, D.C., broker, Shannon andamp; Luchs, looked into doing a TV show but decided against it. William M. Ellis, director of residential sales for Shannon andamp; Luchs, says: &quot;To be very blunt, we talked to our ad agency. We looked at the audience studies. And we determined that they're not reaching a large-enough share of the market to justify the cost.&quot;    MR. ELLIS SAYS listings data show that Long andamp; Foster's market share of listings hasn't changed since its program started: &quot;Ourselves, Long andamp; Foster and Merrill Lynch each have about a 17% to 19% share of the market. One month we may have 19%, Long andamp; Foster may have 18% and Merrill Lynch could have 17%, and the next month that could be reversed. But that's where it has stayed. That indicates to me that they're spending a lot to achieve nothing.&quot;    Mr. Ellis also has reservations about the way Long andamp; Foster shares the show's cost with its agents. &quot;We have real problems when you start getting agents to chip in. You can't ask salespeople to kick in a couple hundred dollars each month,&quot; he says. (Mr. Schlott isn't asking salespeople to help pay for his 13-week series. As for the cost, he will only say that it is &quot;several million dollars.&quot;)    Mr. Ellis also wonders how long brokers sponsoring TV shows can afford to support them without cutting back on other advertising and promotion. &quot;The norm for a real estate brokerage is that anywhere from 13% to 18% of the budget goes for advertising,&quot; he says. &quot;I don't think anybody can stay in business if they're spending more than 18%.    &quot;Residential real estate is a personal business,&quot; Mr. Ellis adds. &quot;It's not the impersonal business where you see a TV show and decide to list your home with that broker.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
