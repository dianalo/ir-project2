He may be delivering your arrestwarrant.   With President Bush placing a high priority on eliminating the``scourge of drugs,'' even the Postal Inspection Service is gettinginto the act.   The service is making arrests on narcotics distribution chargesat more than twice the rate of last year, says Inspector TomMcClure.   ``In fiscal 1988, we arrested 425 people for distributingnarcotics through the mail,'' McClure said. ``In the first sixmonths of this fiscal year, we have arrested 440 people.''   Among their recent finds were $8,000 worth of PCP packed in babyfood jars and mailed from Los Angeles to Broken Arrow, Okla., andillicit steroids being distributed by two men in Miami who werearrested April 17. Officials said that case, the result of atwo-year investigation by postal inspectors and the FBI, was thelargest illicit steroid ring ever busted.   There are 1,800 postal inspectors, of whom 800 do criminalinvestigations including mail fraud, child pornography and internaltheft, McClure said.   About 50 are assigned to focus on drugs, but when a case comesalong, ``We draw on all the other people in the office. ... We'lleven bring them from across the country if the magnitude of thecase calls for that.''   Unlike many agencies that announce their seizures and annualhaul of illegal drugs with great fanfare, the Postal InspectionService has remained relatively low key. A question about exactlyhow many seizures were made and how much in illegal drugs wasseized nationwide in the last fiscal year, for example, was astumper.   ``Well, we've had 440 arrests this year, but we may have hadmore seizures such as something being sent to a P.O. box and no oneever picking it up,'' McClure said.   He noted that the Postal Inspection Service, which for the mostpart works off tips provided by other agencies, generally doesn'tmake large seizures compared with other agencies due to the natureof the mails.   ``In a boat or a container ship or an airliner, they can movetons in those kind of things,'' he said. ``In the mail you can't dothat, at least not in an individual package.''   Often, the mailing of narcotics is not for distribution, justfor the personal use of the recipient, he said.   Private mail services such as United Parcel Service and FederalExpress are not under the same scrutiny as the U.S. mail. Spokesmenfor both companies said they cooperate with federal and localauthorities on drug investigations, but neither would indicateexactly how often this has occurred or whether they instigated anyof the probes.   The Customs Service is cooperating with the Postal Service on aprogram in which mail from 29 high-risk drug source countries iscleared at the port of arrival, according to Dennis Shimkoski ofCustoms.   ``This will prevent ground transfers to inland destinations,eliminates potention monkey business,'' he said.   Already, Customs has seized record quantities of drugs at 21international mail branches. In fiscal 1988, Customs seized 164pounds of heroin, 1,600 pounds of opium and 1,310 pounds ofmarijuana. There were no significant amounts of cocaine mailed,Shimkoski said.   In the first half of fiscal 1989, Customs seized 65 pounds ofheroin, 216 pounds of opium, 10 pounds of cocaine and 297 pounds ofmarijuana at the mail branches. He said the numbers may appear tobe low compared with the previous year ``but there tends to be apickup when you get into the warmer months.''</TEXT></DOC>
