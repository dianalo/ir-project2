The city, seeking to shine during its stint in the limelight, isin the midst of an enormous spruce-up campaign that includescurbing its wreckless drivers and urging its restaurant patrons touse better table manners.   ``I find Seoul citizens quite cooperative with what the citygovernment is doing,'' says Seoul Mayor Kim Yong-nae.   The South Korean capital's 10 million residents are being askedto make more than a few sacrifices for the games, which run fromSept. 17 to Oct. 2.   Highway use, for example, will be rationed. Private cars,depending on their license numbers, will be only allowed to driveon odd- and even-numbered days during the games.   In the meantime, scores of citizens have been cleaning andpainting to brighten the city, and officials say 125,000 trees havebeen planted.   Highways, subways, pollution control, street lighting, floodcontrol and housing all have been improved since Seoul was chosenas the 1988 Olympic host seven years ago, said researcher KangHong-bin of the Korea National Housing Corp.   But construction has led to the eviction of about 100,000 peoplefrom slum areas, says Kim Kwang-soo, secretary-general of the KoreaCouncil of Christian Urban Poor Missions. The evictions haveprompted periodic demonstrations.   Although not all the redevelopment projects been officiallylinked to the games, squatters claim that to some degree theinternational event is behind all the beautification projects _ andthe evictions.   Kim Kwang-Soo says there have been evictions from areas near theOlympic rowing course, the field hockey stadium, the equestriancompetition sites and athletes' village.   But the mayor said the city cannot leave people in illegallybuilt, unsanitary housing that may collapse during rainy seasondownpours. New housing will be built and housing subsidies will beboosted for poor families, he maintained in a recent interview.   The overall price tag for the Games in this economicallythriving city about 30 miles from the North Korean border isgenerally given as $3.1 billion.   About $1.4 billion is money the government is spending on suchprojects as subway and airport expansion and the cleanup of the HanRiver, which runs through the center of the city.   The rest of the costs are covered by Olympic revenue or privateinvestment.   A record 12,000 athletes from 161 nations are expected, alongwith 230,000 sports officials, specialists and tourists, amongothers. An estimated 4,650 volunteers will work at Olympic jobs asguides, interpreters and custodians.   Seoul also wants to clean up its air by closing factories andreducing traffic, much as Los Angeles did when it hosted the 1984games.   A booklet published by Seoul's government says ``industriesknown for polluting the air will be temporarily closed.''   Subway and bus runs will be expanded to curb private vehicle useand companies will be encouraged to give vacations. Motorists arebeing encouraged to use unleaded gasoline, the mayor said.   ``Seoul has been rather notorious for crazy drivers,'' he said,but efforts are being made to enforce rules and smooth traffic flow.   Kim, a presidential appointee who has been mayor since December,said he also expects construction projects to be halted during thegames to cut down on noise and dust.   The Korean press has frequently mentioned ``questionable''hygienic standards in restaurants and ``the prevalent habit of(diners) throwing waste paper ... on the floor.''   The city is demanding cleaner kitchens and restrooms and hasselected 3,000 of the city's some 100,000 restaurants ``as modelsof a sanitary restaurant where foreigners can enjoy Korea'straditional food.''   Such restaurants now have signs in Korean saying ``modelrestaurant,'' and Kim said eateries will be asked to add foreignlanguages to their menus.</TEXT></DOC>
