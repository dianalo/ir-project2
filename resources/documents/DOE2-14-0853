<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-14-0853 </DOCNO><TEXT>There is very little present-day use of hydrogen as an energy carrier.Hydrogen is formed as a by-product of refinery processes, and is usedpartly as a process fuel gas. Certain other isolated energy applicationsexist, too: for example, as a fuel for rocket motors. Hydrogen is alsoused indirectly for energy purposes through utilisation of its abilityto improve the quality of fossil fuels. The main reasons for the limiteduse of hydrogen as an energy carrier are to be found in the relativelyexpensive production process and the lack of a suitable infrastructurefor large-scale distribution. As long as the primary energy sources,such as oil or natural gas, are used more or less directly, hydrogenis not competitive. However, these conditions could change if the availabilityof conventional energy sources was reduced or their use restricted forenvironmental or other reasons. Under such conditions, the use of hydrogenas an energy carrier could become an interesting alternative. The earliestthat a hydrogen economy, i.e. the large-scale use of hydrogen as an energycarrier within society, could be expected is well into the next century.This report provides a general overview of the technology and developmentlevel of the use of hydrogen as an energy carrier. Main headings: -Froma gas for balloons to a future energy carrier; a review. -Energy systemsusing hydrogen. -Some important properties of hydrogen. -Production.-Storage. -Transport. -Use. -Examples of energy systems using hydrogen.-Safety and environmental aspects. -The market. -Research and development.</TEXT></DOC>
