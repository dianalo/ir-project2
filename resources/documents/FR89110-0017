It is the determination of FmHA that thisaction, consisting only of accounting changes, does not constitute a majorFederal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment,and, in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969,Pub. L. 91-190, an Environmental Impact Statement is not required. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>The undersigned has determined that this action will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities becaue it containsnormal business recordkeeping requirements and minimal essential reportingrequirements. <ITAG tagnum="84">Intergovernmental Consultation</ITAG>For reasons set forth in the Final Rule related Notice(s) to 7 CFR Part3015, Subpart V, 48 FR 29115, June 24, 1983, this program/activity is subjectto the provisions of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmentalconsultation with State and local officials. <ITAG tagnum="84">Programs Affected</ITAG>These changes affect the following FmHA programs as listed in the Catalogof Federal Domestic Assistance:<ITAG tagnum="15">10.405 Farm Labor Housing Loans and Grants </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">10.415 Rural Rental Housing Loans </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">10.427 Rural Rental Assistance Payments (Rental Assistance) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>This package is an accumulation of regulation changes needed to complywith the requirements the Single Audit Act of 1984, OMB Circular A-128and ``Audit of Federal Operations and Programs.'' The primary changes proposedinclude the following: 1. OMB Circular A-73, which requires that audits submitted in accordancewith program requirements, must be prepared on the basis of the audit standardsissued by the Comptroller General of the United States. These standardsare published in ``Standards for Audit of Governmental Organizations, Programs,Activities and Functions.'' It is important to note that the standardsinclude the requirement that the generally accepted Government auditingstandards (GAGAS) be used instead of the generally accepted auditing standards(GAAS). Audits must be submitted by certain participants in the MultipleFamily Housing Programs. GAGAS has three elements: (1) Financial and compliance;(2) economy and efficiency; and, (3) program results. FmHA will only berequiring auditors to use the GAGAS element that provides for financialand compliance audits. Basic financial statements should be prepared inconformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The changefrom GAAS to GAGAS will have only a minimal effect on the conduct of audits,since GAGAS requires the auditor to report on the entity's material compliancewith requirements governing financial assistance it received; and, GAAP-basedreporting requires disclosure of material violations of legal and contractualprovisions. Therefore, it is FmHA's feeling that to perform a GAGAS audit,the auditor would have to conduct similar tests of the accounting recordsand such other auditing procedures as considered in performing a GAAS audit.FmHA believes the proposed changes will clarify the regulations and helpFmHA to serve the public more efficiently while protecting the Government'sinterest. 2. The paragraphs on audits of borrower operations are revised to complywith the Single Audit Act of 1984, Pub. L. 98-502, and OMB Circular A-128,``Audits of State and Local Governments.'' The Single Audit Act establishesaudit requirements for State and local governments that receive Federalassistance and defines Federal responsibilities for implementing and monitoringthese requirements. Section 7505 of the Act requires OMB to issue implementingguidelines which were issued as OMB Circular A-128. Further, the Circulardirected Federal agencies to publish regulations implementing it. 3. FmHA expects to include additional changes to 7 CFR Part 1930, SubpartC in the final rule. These additional proposed changes are not includedfor publication in the proposed rule because they are items of internalmanagement not directly impacting the public. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 1930 </ITAG>Accounting, Administrative practice and procedure, Grant programs_Housingand community development, Loan programs_Housing and community development,Low and moderate income housing loans_Rental, Reporting requirements.Accordingly, FmHA proposes to amend Part 1930, Subpart C, Title 7, Codeof Federal Regulations as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 1930_GENERAL</ITAG>1.
