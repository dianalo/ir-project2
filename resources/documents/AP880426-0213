DALE NELSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The United States and Canada will not reachagreement on a way to reduce acid rain emissions before the Reaganadministration leaves office, a senior administration officialpredicted Tuesday on the eve of a visit by Canadian Prime MinisterBrian Mulroney.   The official, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity,denied that President Reagan agreed during a meeting with Mulroneyin Ottawa last April to commit the United States to specifictargets and timetables for the reduction of emissions.   Mulroney, in a conversation with American reporters in theCanadian capital on Friday, said he was disappointed with theadministration's lack of action against U.S. smokestack emissionsthat he says are killing lakes and damaging forests north of theborder.   And the Canadian Embassy in Washington, in a booklet distributedin advance of Wednesay's meeting between Reagan and Mulroney, said,``Canada cannot solve the problem on its own. ... Canada is takingaction and we expect the United States to do likewise.''   Meanwhile, 19 senators, including six Republicans, released aletter they had sent to Reagan urging him to reach agreement withMulroney at the meeting on the environmental issue.   ``It would be most fitting for you to end your last summitmeeting with Prime Minister Mulroney with an agreement to controlacid rain,'' the letter said.   The senators, most of them from the Northeast, included GeorgeMitchell, D-Maine, principal author of a clean air bill awaitingfloor action, and Robert Stafford of Vermont, senior Republican onthe Senate Environment Committee.   Reagan's agreement to seek a bilateral accord with Canada on theissue was inserted, during his meeting with Mulroney in Ottawa, ina speech the president made later in the day at the Canadianparliament.   The official, who was present at the meeting, said Reagan``hasn't changed his mind'' about trying to reach an agreement.   But the official said that when the United States later proposedan accord, ``it did not meet what Canada apparently wanted in thisspecific area, which is targets and timetables.''   ``I am not aware of any time that the two leaders agreed thatthe accord would include targets and timetables,'' theadministration official said.   Instead, the official said, Reagan and Mulroney agreed to ``tryto find a bilateral accord that moved us ahead a little, but wehaven't been able to.''   Canada proposed a draft treaty calling for a 44 percentreduction in estimated northbound flow of sulfur dioxide, apollutant from coal-fired power plants and other sources thatprovides a key raw material for making acid rain. Of about 23million tons of U.S. sulfur dioxide emissions, about 4 million tonsflows north across the border _ an amount Canada proposed should belimited to 2.2 million tons.   Reagan and Mulroney did agree two years ago that the UnitedStates should pursue a $5 billion, five-year demonstration effortto move ``clean coal'' combustion technologies into commercial usein a way that would reduce pollution flow across the boundary.Though Congress has cooperated in providing the government's halfshare of the money, few projects are under way yet andenvironmentalists criticize the program as little more than a porkbarrel for the coal and utility industries.   Asked whether the United States and Canada would be able toreach agreement by Jan. 20, when the Reagan administration leavesoffice, on an approach that will significantly reduce acid rain,the official said: ``No, I don't. It is a difference in approach.''   ``If you are going to put a lot of money into something, you hadbetter make sure you have the right technology,'' the officialsaid. ``You had better know there is a direct relationship betweenwhat you are doing and where the acid deposition is coming from.''   When asked whether this meant the administration considered theproblem too costly to tackle, the official said, ``It is too dearif you are using the wrong technologies and when you get all doneyou haven't solved the Canada problem. People are just simply veryreluctant to say, `Here we go full tilt,' and when you get done youhaven't solved the problem as it addresses itself in theU.S.-Canadian relationship.''</TEXT></DOC>
