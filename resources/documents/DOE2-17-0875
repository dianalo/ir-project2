A majorportion of system operating cost is due to the incidence of unscheduleddowntime as even small unscheduled stoppages for emergency repairs fordifferent mine equipment in the integrated operating system may ultimatelyreduce the system effectiveness considerably. This results in increasedsystem life-cycle cost. Under these circumstances reliability investigationsbecome an integral part of design, planning and operation of a mine-system.In this paper, an attempt has been made to describe and introduce somemodels applied in reliability investigations and to demonstrate how theyare going to be useful for mining industry. The main purposes of thispaper is to initiate a debate in the mining industry about the applicabilityof the reliability techniques and their economic implications which maylead to more organized research work in mining industry to identify areaswith low reliability and indicate the bottlenecks for potential improvement.17 refs., 5 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
