Indeed the justificationfor the huge amounts of research money that goes into it, is that itwill be - by the middle of the next century - the answer to a major lackof energy resources. However, this is questioned. The current positionon fusion power research (the JET tokamak is still a factor of 5 awayfrom plasma breakeven, a factor of 25 away from ignition) is noted. Thescientific problems still to be overcome - how to get higher temperaturesand density and longer confinement time and then the engineering problems,the scale of structures necessary, first wall materials, fuel, coolant,radioactivity and resources of tungsten and vanadium, are discussed.The costs involved in the research and development of fusion reactorsare enormous. The economic viability of electricity produced by fusionis questionable and there is still doubt that it will work at all. (U.K.).</TEXT></DOC>
