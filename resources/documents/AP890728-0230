Chairman Lee Iacocca told Chrysler's top 700 managers in aregularly scheduled meeting Thursday that the company was embarkingon a program that will result, among other things, in a reductionof its white-collar work force by 8.3 percent, or about 2,300 jobs,by the end of this year.   The cuts were mandated by lower-than-expected vehicle saleslevels; rising costs, especially in sales incentives; and forecastsof a softening economy as the 1990s begin, said Bennett Bidwell,chairman of Chrysler Motors Corp., the company's vehicle-making arm.   ``It is not a recession, knee-jerk reaction,'' he said. ``We'vegot to get costs out to get competitive.''   Bidwell said the company has a budget this year of about $26billion and a $1 billion cut ``is a big deal.''   Industry analysts had mixed reactions.   Ron Glantz of Montgomery Securities Inc. of San Franciscodoubted whether much of the cut would show up in Chrysler's profits.   ``This is an industry that kills to take a dollar out of thecost of building a car,'' he said. ``Not very much of thisbillion-dollar reduction is going to flow to the bottom line. Theyare going to have to reduce advertising and marketing, which willhurt sales.''   But Scott Merlis, of Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. Inc. in New York, toldThe New York Times that the move should boost earnings.   ``If they can cut $1 billion in a little over a year, that wouldbe a super achievement, with a profound impact on their bottomline,'' he said.   Each of the Big Three automakers has been involved incost-cutting programs of some scale. Many of the programs stemmedfrom the tough times the companies weathered in the early 1980s.   The cuts, industry officials and analysts have said, put thecompanies in better positions to withstand vehicle sales slumps orother economic pressures, such as rising interest rates or flaggingconsumer confidence.   At Chrysler, employees 55 years and older with more than 10years of company service will be offered early retirements andbuyouts to get them off the payroll.   Bidwell said the personnel cuts will begin in about six weeks,possibly decreasing white-collar employment levels in someoperations by up to 25 percent.   ``Nothing is hands off,'' he said.   Meantime, the company expects to save money through a voluntarypay-cut plan linked to Chrysler stock prices and progress on theoverall cost-cutting program.   In essence, the plan would ask 2,000 salaried workers to reducetheir pay 5 percent to 15 percent, with the money going into thecompany coffers. The money would be repaid in 15 months on asliding scale, linked to the stock price, if cost-cutting reachesat least half of its goal.   If the program is less successful than that, the employees wouldforfeit the money.   Bidwell and Chrysler Chief Financial Officer Robert S. Millersaid it was unknown how much money the plan would save Chrysler inthe short term, but it would be in the millions of dollars.   ``We put this together last night,'' Bidwell told reportersThursday afternoon.   Elsewhere in the corporation, managers were told to tighten somealready tight belts. Bidwell said the company had just conducted astudy of job redundancy and fluff, indicating where savings couldbe made.   The company, whose two other divisions operate financialservices and Gulfstream Aerospace, may cut its advertising,marketing and sports event promotions budgets, he added.   ``We've got to go after everything that walks,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
