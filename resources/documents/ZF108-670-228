Of course not.andP;  ATandamp;T is only carrying the informationand is not responsible for its content.andP;  The BBS operator deserves the samekind of protection.andM;Perhaps the Electronic Frontier Foundation can also help educate the publicon the distinction between the hacker -- a curious explorer of computersoftware and operating systems -- and the cracker, who simply is out tosteal.andP;  Hackers seek to test out operating systems and software withoutcausing physical or financial damage.andP;  But to many, the word &quot;hacker&quot; issynonymous with crime.andM;On-line communications systems have much potential.andP;  Armed with a modem,users can examine government documents, discuss their ideas with others, playgames and do their shopping.andP;  It would be a shame if the fear of a fewcriminals leads to restrictions on the use of computer communications.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
