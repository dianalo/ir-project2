Although foreign deposits aren't covered by federaldeposit insurance, they frequently are protected because ofthe way the FDIC handles bank failures. The panel said thatwhen the FDIC pays off foreign depositors, banks that rely onforeign deposits -- generally large banks in major moneycenters -- will bear the cost of the coverage throughpremiums assessed on an asset base that includes foreigndeposits.</LP><TEXT>   Currently, federal deposit insurance is financed bypremiums that banks pay on domestic deposits only. Smallbanks, which generally don't have foreign deposits, havecomplained that this unfairly forces them to bear the cost ofreimbursing foreign depositors. The provision would beparticularly costly to major New York City banks, which raisesubstantial amounts of funds abroad. However, these banksgenerally favored the amendment, which headed off a moreexpensive change.   Under the comprehensive banking-law overhaul the Senatepanel is considering, the new payment provision would applyuntil Jan. 1, 1995. After that date, the bill would bar theFDIC from paying off uninsured deposits, which includeforeign deposits and the balance in accounts that exceed the$100,000 deposit insurance coverage.   The bill the panel is considering would restrict the scopeof federal deposit insurance, give the FDIC $70 billion innew borrowing authority to bolster the depleted bank depositinsurance fund, tighten bank regulation, and allow banks tobranch nationwide and offer customers new services.   Banking panel Chairman Donald Riegle (D., Mich.) hopes thecommittee will finish the huge bill today. But in more than10 hours of work yesterday, the committee disposed of only ahandful of the 324 amendments before it.   In one decision, the committee voted in favor of aprovision designed to discourage the Federal Reserve Boardfrom making long-term loans to support weak banks, althoughthe panel worked through the night on the final form of theprovision. Sen. Riegle wants to prevent the Fed from usingloans from its discount window to prop up institutions thatwould otherwise fail, arguing that this increases the cost ofbank failures to the deposit insurance fund. However,Republicans on the committee are worried about limiting theFed's flexibility to maintain stability during a financialcrisis, and late last night were preparing a modified planthat would meet their concerns.   The panel also voted to require accountants to issuepublic reports on the adequacy of a bank's internal controlsto avoid risky loans and other unsound activities. Theamendment, introduced by Sen. Timothy Wirth (D., Colo.) withstrong support from the General Accounting Office, wouldapply to about 2,000 large banks, those with assets of $150million or more. The banking industry opposed the amendmentas a costly new requirement. Sen. Wirth estimated that therule would boost bank auditing costs by 10%, but he said thechange would help regulators zero in on banks that areoperating with inadequate internal controls.   A provision also was approved to liberalize the FederalReserve's definition of what constitutes a controllinginterest in a bank. The change, designed to make it easier toinvest in banks, would allow investors to purchase up to24.9% of a bank's shares without having to register with theFed as a bank holding company.   The panel also voted a pilot project to design arisk-based deposit insurance premium plan that would requireweak banks to pay higher premiums to the FDIC than strongbanks. And the panel voted a $180 million federal loanguarantee to support Rhode Island's plan to repay creditunion depositors who lost money when a state depositinsurance fund failed early this year.</TEXT></DOC>
