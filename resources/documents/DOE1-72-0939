More researchis needed on the way that radiation enters the food chain, and the measuresthat can be taken to counter the health hazards posed by fallout. A secondclear need is for a global radioactivity monitoring system. Third, internationalstandards need to be established for methods of sampling, analysis andreporting of the radioactive levels in foods. Finally, an effort mustbe made to inform the public so it can distinguish between the real andthe imaginary hazards posed by radioactively contaminated foods.</TEXT></DOC>
