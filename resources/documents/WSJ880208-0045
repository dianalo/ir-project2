The move is a coup for Bankers Trust, which beat out several other major New York banks, in competitive bidding. Bankers Trust would receive about a $2.5 million commission to both arrange the credit agreement and select a consortium of 30 or more U.S. and foreign banks, which Kodak must approve.    Kodak said it expects to refinance the borrowings with commercial paper, long-term debt or a combination of both. The remaining $100 million needed for the acquisition will come from the company's working capital, said the Rochester, N.Y.-based photographic and chemical concern.    Last month, Kodak offered to buy New York-based Sterling for $89.50 a share, or $5.1 billion, thwarting a hostile bid from Switzerland's F. Hoffmann-La Roche andamp; Co.    Terms of the loan agreement, disclosed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, clear up part of the discrepancy involving the anticipated dilution in Kodak's stock because of the acquisition.    Kodak earlier projected dilution at about 15 cents to 25 cents a share for 1988 earnings. Some analysts had estimated the dilution at triple that amount based on long-term interest rates of 10% to 11% as well as a 40-year amortization of goodwill. Instead, under the short-term credit agreement, the interest rate would be an estimated 7.1%, analysts said.    The pretax interest cost on a 7.1% rate would be offset by Sterling's estimated pretax earnings in 1988, said analyst Peter Enderlin of Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. Sterling expects operating profit of about $379 million in 1988, on revenue of $2.57 billion.    Still, some analysts believe that the dilution will be slightly higher than Kodak's estimate and that the company will have to refinance the loans at higher, long-term interest rates.    Even in light of the new credit agreement, Mr. Enderlin estimates Kodak's dilution at about 30 cents to 40 cents a share, down from an earlier projection of 45 cents to 60 cents.    Under the Bankers Trust agreement, the interest rate for the first year would be based on one of several different options. Those options, according to the SEC document, include a base rate that would consist either of Bankers Trust's prime rate or the federal funds' rate, whichever is higher, plus 1/4%; the reserve adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate, or Libor, plus 10 basis points, or a competitive bid option whereby Kodak would ask Bankers Trust to solicit competitive bids from consortium members. The document further states that for the next two years, the interest rate will be determined by, among other options, reserve adjusted Libor plus 1/8%, the base rate or the competitive bid option.    One factor remains unknown in determining dilution: How Kodak will amortize the estimated $4.07 billion in goodwill that it will incur in the Sterling acquisition.    Kodak may stretch out the amortization over a 40-year-period, which could dilute shares about 31 cents apiece, some analysts said. They said Kodak also could sell off some of Sterling, such as its household products business, to pay down the debt. But Kodak has said it would keep the business, which is expected to generate about 35% of Sterling's 1988 operating profit. </TEXT></DOC>
