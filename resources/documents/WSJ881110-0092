DESPITE A QUARTER century of activism, lawsuits and legislation, women today aren't any closer to economic equality with men than in 1960, a distinguished economist concludes. But the reason, says Victor Fuchs, a Stanford University professor, isn't continued employer discrimination or other frequently cited problems, but rather women's greater commitment to having and caring for children.    In a new book, &quot;Women's Quest for Economic Equality,&quot; Mr. Fuchs concedes that since 1960 the wage gap between men and women has narrowed considerably. However, he says, there have been offsetting changes for the worse: As time passed, &quot;women had less leisure while men had more, an increase in the proportion of adults not married made more women dependent on their own income, and women's share of financial responsibility for children rose.&quot; Any assessment of women's economic status, he insists, must consider the whole picture.    Mr. Fuchs bolsters his argument with a stream of statistical analyses. For example, he calculates that between 1980 and 1986, women increased their average hours worked -- including paid work, housework and child care -- by 7%, while men decreased theirs by about an equal amount. Another typical finding: Of 1.5 million white women in their 30s who earned over $25,000 in 1986, more than half were childless; by comparison, only 24% of women earning less were childless.    To have or care for children, Mr. Fuchs says, many women accept not only loss of leisure but also lower wages in exchange for part-time or more flexible hours, a job location near home and limits on out-of-town travel. &quot;This desire and this concern create an economic disadvantage for women, which is strongest at ages 25 to 45,&quot; he contends, &quot;but the effects remain throughout life.&quot;    One exception: &quot;young, white, unmarried, well-educated women, who made large gains relative to their male counterparts.&quot;    Many Marriages Handle   Retirement With Ease   ACCORDING TO widely held belief, marital strains rise sharply when husbands retire. They're around the house, the reasoning goes, demanding attention and getting underfoot.    Not so, say sociologists David Ekerdt and Barbara Vinick in a Veterans Administration study. They compared the marital complaints of two sets of elderly couples -- 82 in which the husbands were still working, 65 in which they had retired within the year. The groups, otherwise demographically comparable, answered some 30 questions used by marriage therapists to analyze marital discord.    The researchers found &quot;no important differences&quot; between the groups in the number or level of complaints. In both groups, for example, wives wanted the husbands to help more with housework, pay more attention to personal appearance; husbands wanted more interesting meals, more frequent sex. And in both samples, each sex wanted more shows of appreciation and affection and fewer arguments.    As far as marital relations go, says Mr. Ekerdt, &quot;couples before and after retirement largely complain about the same things.&quot;    Ideas About Care Costs   Are Often Unrealistic   ALTHOUGH THEY know they may eventually need long-term care, middle-aged and older people show surprising ignorance about its likely costs, according to a survey for Transamerica Life Cos. A New Jersey research firm, New World Decisions, examined attitudes and awareness among 1,000 randomly selected men and women, half between 45 and 55 and half over 65.    Practically all worried that inflation and health-care costs would eat into retirement income and living standards. Yet about one-fourth said they had no idea how much a year in a nursing home would cost, and about one-fourth of the rest thought it was less than $15,000. The national average actually is about $22,000.    Those queried were also wildly over-optimistic about how much Medicare would help toward nursing-home bills. About half said they didn't know. But of those who thought they did, most respondents 45 to 55 years old estimated that Medicare covered about 36% of these costs, while the senior group figured 29%. The actual amount is only about 4%.    Study Provides Profile   Of Urban Homeless   THE URBAN homeless are overwhelmingly male, nonwhite and 31 to 50 years old. Almost four out of five are alone, while 15% are children and 8% are adults in families with kids.    These are among the findings from an Urban Institute sampling of 1,700 homeless individuals using soup kitchens and shelters in 20 representative cities. The survey was part of a larger government-contracted study of federally subsidized feeding programs.    Blacks account for about 41% of the urban homeless, just over three times their share of the general urban population, the institute says, and Hispanics are slightly overrepresented. Almost half of the urban homeless didn't graduate from high school, compared with 19% of all adults.    Most have been homeless for substantial periods -- the median was 10 months -- and most have been jobless even longer, about four years on average. Almost one in five has a history of mental hospitalization; one-third have been in a detoxification or alcohol/drug treatment center; half have spent more than several days in a county jail; and one-fourth have served time in state or federal prison. Two out of three have been in at least one of these institutional settings, and nearly 20% have been in three or four. </TEXT></DOC>
