Here's the plan. After impassioned speeches about ``fiscalaccountability'' and ``getting our own house in order,'' the Senatewill vote overwhelmingly against the $45,000 salary boost. But overin the House, the pay issue will never see the light of day. Sinceboth houses of Congress have to vote against the raise to derail it,it will go into effect automatically.   If that scenario sounds familiar, it should. This is the samescheme used just two years ago when the Democratic leadershipengineered a $12,500 congressional pay boost, increasing lawmakers'pay to the present $89,500.   On that occasion, the Casey Jones at the throttle, Speaker JimWright, had the cheek to order a meaningless voice vote on thesalary increase the day after it automatically became law. Thelawmakers dutifully deplored the shameful looting of the treasury,pocketed the money and snickered all the way to the bank.   It is a perfect setup. Representatives and senators can boast totheir constituents of their opposition to wasteful spending, blamingtheir personal windfall on the salary review panel composed mostlyof congressional appointees and capital insiders, a panel theycreated in the first place to relieve themselves of accountability.   Although public opinion polls show that 85 percent of Americansoppose the pay raise, and despite tons of congressional mailopposing the raise, the big salary grab of 1989 is a sure thing.</TEXT><TEXT>   Jan. 28   The Journal, New Ulm, Minn., on federal pay raises:   Congress and other top ranking officials will apparently gettheir 50 percent pay raise. Opponents of the measure in the House ofRepresentatives are sure they won't be able to bring the matter to avote before the deadline. ... Opponents of the controversial payincrease are ready to go ahead, with House Democratic leaders'blessing, with legislation to remove the major sources of outsideincome that present congressman the most chances for abuse.   The legislation would ban honorariums, or fees that senators andrepresentatives receive from special interest groups for makingspeeches at various functions. A congressman can now fly in to aconvention at the expense of some group, give a 10-minute speech,and fly back to Washington with a fat speaking fee, up to $28,500worth. The ban would prevent these thinly veiled payoffs.   Congressmen are going to find this new salary increase isn'tgoing to sit well with folks back home. The House and Senate canonly save face by passing outside income restrictions like the onesproposed, and requiring members to adhere strictly to them.</TEXT><TEXT>   Jan. 26   The Westerly (R.I.) Sun on education in the United States:   In 1983, the U.S. Department of Education released ``A Nation atRisk,'' a sobering assessment of education in our country. ...   The report said ... that American students were well behindstudents in other industrial nations academically, that about 23million ... adults were functionally illiterate ... and that averageachievement of high school students on most standardized tests waslower than 25 years ago. ...   The findings led to an unprecedented flurry of reform activity.... Within 12 months, some 275 task forces were formed to guidereform efforts. Governors and legislators in 35 states acted tostrengthen high school graduation requirements.   Perhaps even more importantly, many school systems haveundertaken fundamental reforms of age-old educational practices. ...   We have made tremendous progress in the (past) five years ... butthe job is far from done. ...   We must continue to apply pressure across the board to makecertain the educational reform movement keeps the initiative againstthe reactionary forces arrayed against it.</TEXT><TEXT>   Jan. 26   The Charleston (W.Va.) Gazette on airplane safety:   ``Engine falls off Piedmont jet at Chicago.''   ``Eastern jet loses wing section over Alabama.''   ``Boeing told carriers of possible faulty part.''   ``Plane (a United commuter) makes emergency landing.''   Those were the headlines of near-disasters. ... They raiseominous doubts about America's airline safety.   Deregulation has been a disaster for the nation's airlines. Manyhave gone belly-up (figuratively). The survivors have had to giveextraordinary discounts on fares to remain competitive.   And while no one says so, it seems possible that preventivemaintenance and inspections of the commercial air fleet are beingskimped to save money.   Even though the air industry vows that it's safer than ever, theBush administration and Congress should think seriously aboutreimposing regulation, at least on maintenance, inspections and anaffordable plan for replacing the aging aircraft now in service.</TEXT><TEXT>   Jan. 29   Los Angeles Times on Gorbachev's domestic troubles:   The Soviet Union's new candor has prompted the public admissionthat the government not only runs a budget deficit, but that it's awhopper. ...   Leonid I. Abalkin, director of the National Institute of theEconomy, says that this year's real deficit, including borrowing,will exceed $160 billion. That's equivalent to 11 percent of thegross national product, compared to a U.S. budget deficit that isabout 4 percent of GNP.   The deficit, Abalkin says, ``ruins'' the economy. For PresidentMikhail S. Gorbachev it also raises the most troubling politicalquestions.   For one thing, Abalkin says, trying to reduce the deficit willforce deferring until at least the mid-1990s the major improvementin living standards that Gorbachev has made a priority in hisprogram to restructure the economy.   So far ... the Gorbachev era has seen a net decline in livingstandards, with shortages of food and basic consumer goodsdeepening. ...   As part of the effort to cut the deficit, Abalkin says, about 20percent of current capital investment in the civilian sector will beslashed. The prospect, then, is for things to get worse before theystart to get better.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
