The November rise follows two months of roller-coaster sales numbers as a result of special incentives offered by auto makers. Retail sales dropped a revised 5.2% in October, a record, after rising a revised 5.6% in September, when the auto promotions were under way. The latest numbers suggest that sales continue to show an underlying trend of modest growth.    The surge in furniture and appliance sales may reflect efforts by consumers to buy big-ticket items before year's end so that they can deduct the sales tax. Under the new tax law, state and local sales taxes won't be deductible for federal income tax purposes after Dec. 31.    Furniture, home furnishings and equipment stores saw their sales rise 2.8% in November, the department said, after dipping 0.5% the previous month. Food stores also showed a healthy rise in sales, while auto dealers and general-merchandise stores reported declines.    &quot;It looks like most of the action was in home furniture and appliances,&quot; said Rosalind Wells, chief economist of J.C. Penney Co. &quot;Otherwise, there is a continuation of less-than-robust sales.&quot; Mrs. Wells said it is still too early to determine whether sales will show a stronger-than-usual holiday pickup. &quot;It's hard to draw conclusions now,&quot; she said. &quot;Everything will happen the week before Christmas.&quot;    Even if Christmas sales provide a boost to the retail numbers for December, consumer spending in the final quarter of the year is likely to be down from the third quarter, according to Commerce Undersecretary Robert Ortner. That's because the September surge in auto sales boosted third-quarter spending to a level that isn't likely to be repeated in the current quarter.    Steady growth in consumer spending has helped keep the economy expanding this year, but a number of analysts believe consumer spending will drop off next year. The National Association of Manufacturers, for instance, forecast yesterday that weak consumer spending would hold overall economic growth next year to a slim 1.3%. &quot;If it weren't for the chances of substantial improvement in the trade balance, you'd be looking at a recession next year,&quot; said Jerry Jasinowski, chief economist for the association.    The Reagan administration is forecasting 3.2% growth next year, while most private forecasts fall in between the administration's optimistic and the manufacturers' pessimistic projections. In the first three quarters of this year the economy has grown at a 2.4% annual rate.    Overall sales of durable goods, which are intended to last three years or more, rose 0.3% in November after falling 12.9% the previous month. Sales of nondurables rose 0.7% after a 0.4% rise.    The rise in retail sales brought them to an adjusted $122.25 billion in November, up from a revised $121.62 billion the previous month.    November sales were 5.9% above a year earlier. All the numbers are adjusted to account for predictable seasonal variations. Before seasonal adjustment, sales in November totaled $122.37 billion, down from a revised $123.31 billion in October. </TEXT></DOC>
