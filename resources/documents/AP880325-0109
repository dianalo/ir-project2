The National Association of Realtors said that existingsingle-family homes were sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rateof 3.29 million units in February. While this was 11.3 percentbelow the sales level of a year ago, it was the first advance sincea 1.2 percent rise in October.   Sales fell 2.9 percent in November, 1.2 percent in December and4.8 percent in January as the housing market was rocked by volatilemortgage rates and consumer worries sparked by the October stockmarket collapse.   The February increase in sales was credited to better economicnews, falling interest rates and renewed consumer confidence.Fixed-rate mortgages, which stood at 10.61 percent at the beginningof the year, have fallen into single-digits, standing at 9.92percent currently.   ``Lower interest rates have brought the consumer back into themarket,'' said John Tuccillo, chief economist for the association.``February's existing home sales numbers indicate good health onthe part of the housing sector, which, in the sixth year ofexpansion, is far from dead.''   Tuccillo predicted the lower mortgage rates would help boostsales even further in the months ahead.   The rise in home sales was accompanied by a slight increase inhome prices. The median or mid-point price of a home increased to$88,300, up from $87,400 in January.   The increase in sales was led by a 12.8 percent jump in sales inthe South, which rose to an annual rate of 1.23 million units,still 4.7 percent below the level of activity a year ago. Thisregion has been hard hit by depressed conditions in the oilindustry.   Sales were also up in the Northeast, climbing 8.2 percent to anannual rate of 660,000 units.   Sales fell 5.4 percent in the Midwest to an annual rate of870,000 units, but analysts blamed this decline on unusually severeweather in the region during February. Sales dipped a small 1.9percent in the West to an annual rate of 520,000 units.</TEXT></DOC>
