The leading contender is novelist Mario VargasLlosa. A few months ago, Mr. Llosa was interviewed by hisfriend, Chilean economist and essayist David Gallagher. Theinterview took place at the Center of Public Studies inSantiago and was published in the Center's publicationEstudios Publicos. Excerpts appear below:                                                                                                       </LP><TEXT>   Mr. Gallagher: Why do you think that, generally speaking,writers and intellectuals have the tendency to opposefree-market experiments and libertarian revolutions?   Mr. Vargas Llosa: Because unlike socialism, capitalism hasnever generated a mystique; capitalism was never preceded bya utopian vision.   Intellectuals and artists have a strength -- that comesperhaps from the artist's condition itself -- which is thecondition of the dreamer; the man who wants to transcend thelimits of reality, to go further. Capitalism has nothing todo with that. It has to do with reality. Capitalism is withinthe limits of the human.   The poet and novelist want no part of this reality. Theywant to transcend it. They want to substitute it. They wantto change it for a reality that comes out of their fantasies-- out of their desires. Then, how can they acceptcapitalism? It is very difficult; there is a resistance tohuman mediocrity.   What the intellectual should do is at least toleratemediocrity, because mediocrity is what has brought usprogress. The utopian vision, on the other hand, which is sobeautiful in the abstract, has brought nothing but barbarity.Utopias have never brought progress. After the establishmentof religious or revolutionary utopias there are multitudes ofcadavers, great amounts of tortured people, millions who arepurged and sent to concentration camps. We are living it nowin Iran: that materialization of the utopia in which a wholecountry gets hooked, bringing thousands of deaths, and thedestruction of an economy that could be, perhaps, one of themost prosperous in the world.   The intellectual in Latin America confronts a tragicpanorama of hunger, exploitation and terrible discrimination.Therefore, there exists the totally false but deeply rootedbeliefs about what capitalism is. Of course, this vision is acomplete caricature. Thus, to defend a capitalist model meansto defend the existent model -- to defend the&quot;establishment.&quot;   The curious part is that in Latin America, reality hasbecame more socialist than capitalist. This is a socialismthat does not carry the name, but in practice that is what itis. We have states that have been overbuilt; we haveinterventionist practices; we have a multitude of economicpolicy control systems. The confusion in the intellectualworld is that they have come to accept the idea thatcapitalism is the &quot;establishment,&quot; when it is exactly thecontrary. What our countries do not have is a genuine liberaleconomy; a genuine capitalist economy with a free market,free competition and nonintervention by the state.   It is not bad that intellectuals and artists will beconstant critics of the &quot;establishment.&quot; I believe it islegitimate that they defend the utopian vision. What isdangerous is if this utopian vision turns into politicalpower.                                                                                                          Mr. Gallagher: If you become president, your term willcoincide with the fifth centenary of the discovery ofAmerica. How are you going to celebrate this milestone?   Mr. Vargas Llosa: The anniversary is going to provoke alot of speeches around the Hispanic world -- endless ones.But I am afraid that a good part of the celebration willremain in the realm of rhetoric effusions. We may lose theopportunity of celebrating in a creative fashion.   For instance, we should explore the battle against thespirit of &quot;nationalism&quot; in Latin America, which still ispending. All ideologies in Latin America -- whether on thepolitical right or left -- are, in some way or another,involved in applauding this curse of nationalism. This is anissue that is approached very prudently and very rarely inLatin America.   But I believe this attachment to nationalism as an idealis a curse we will have to fight if we ever are to get out ofthe stage of underdevelopment. Even if we become a bit moredeveloped, we will still be out of step with the rest of theworld if we do not become a part of the profound process ofintegration taking place around the world. And I believe thatprocess is incompatible with the nationalist culture that isrooted at all levels of our society.   Thus, the anniversary should remind us that our bordersare, in large part, fictitious, artificial things created bybureaucrats who do not respond to the profound realities ofLatin America -- neither the past ones nor the present ones.This fifth centenary should be used to help liberate us fromnationalism, to provoke a great continental mobilization tothe idea of integration, to dissolve the borders. But I amafraid that because the celebrations will be directed bygovernments -- I mean, through political power -- politicianswill take advantage of ceremonies to engage in exercises ofauto eulogy. So, I am afraid that nothing important is reallygoing to happen.                                                                                                          Mr. Gallagher: How is the writer in you -- one who is amerciless critic of power -- going to coexist with thepolitical actor?   Mr. Vargas Llosa: Well, as cat and dog. It is a verydifficult coexistence between the writer and the politician.Both are activities that intimately repel one another, thereis no doubt about that. The writer is a man who works insolitude. He is entirely owner of his own acts, of everythinghe does. This is very different from the politician who worksimmersed in a mixture of people, who has to permanentlyaccept the politics of the minor evil, knowing that he can bewrong about identifying the minor evil.   My distrust of power has not decreased. Now that I amdoing politics, I daily verify how all those low levels ofpersonality show up in endless ways in the political life,because they have to do with power. And power brings out theworst there is in human beings. So, that reconfirms mydistrust toward power, my conviction that power brings outthe worse.   I think that is why I have come to liberalism. If there isa system of generalized distrust toward power, that isliberalism. True liberalism believes that power is a dangerand that it has to be dispersed -- pulverized -- in society.That is why I believe that the best defense the human racehas against that threat to the individual is to dispersepower within society in a way that no group, no party canreally subordinate others to their convenience or to theirwill.   That is why, if I get to power, I want to fight so thatexecutive power is kept limited, restricted and decentralizedso that all Peruvians can start to participate in power. I donot know if I will accomplish this, but the idea I have is atleast clear: The only way to fight exploitation,discrimination, brutality -- something that is a part of thePeruvian experience -- is by distributing power throughoutthe society. The ones who have gone farthest in this are theliberal thinkers, who have come to the defense of individualswho confront the modern monster that is power.</TEXT></DOC>
