But black Americans, increasingly thevictims of homicide and AIDS, are seeing their life expectancy fallfurther.   That is the picture painted by the latest tally of the nation'shealth, released Wednesday. And there's more:   Blacks are twice as likely to die in infancy as whites. Pregnantblack women receive early prenatal care far less than whites. Blacksare disproportionately afflicted with influenza and pneumonia.   Health Secretary Louis Sullivan said the report showed _ as thestatistics have since 1970 _ ``that there is a disparity between thehealth of our white and black populations.''   Dr. Manning Feinleib, director of the National Center for HealthStatistics, told reporters that the basic causes for blacks'declining life expectancy relate to ``nutrition, poverty (and)access to (health) care'' that affect ``a wide variety of conditionsfrom infant mortality to mortality at later ages.''   One other likely cause Feinleib mentioned: drug-related murders.   Buttressing that assessment, the death rate among black men,frequently the victims of drug-related violence, was 50 percenthigher than for white men in 1986, the last year for whichcomprehensive statistics were available.   In all, the report, ``Health, United States,'' painted thisstatistical picture for 1986:   _A child born that year could expect to live 74.8 years, up from74.7 years in 1985.   _A white child had a life expectancy of 75.4 years in 1986, upfrom 75.3.   _But a black child born that year could expect to die at just69.4 years, down from 69.5 in 1985 and 69.7 in 1984.   Life expectancies were not calculated for other population groups.   Much of the improvement in overall life expectancy was laid todramatic declines in heart disease and stroke, which have come aboutlargely because more and more Americans are giving up smoking or notstarting at all. Smoking is a risk factor for both diseases.   From 1970 to 1986, deaths from heart disease fell 31 percent,although the disease remains the leading cause of death in America.During the same period, deaths from stroke, the third leading cause,dropped 53 percent.   Now, said Sullivan, the nation needs to focus more attention ``onsuch critical areas as prevention of AIDS, unintentional injuries,homicide and suicide.''   As for AIDS, the report said that the percentage of males age 13or older infected with the deadly virus rose at least 30 percent,based on preliminary data, from 1987 to 1988.   Among blacks, the AIDS infection rate rose 51 percent. Amongfemales, it skyrocketed 67 percent _ 42 percent among white females,74 percent among blacks and 97 percent among Hispanics.   Infant mortality was cut in half from 1970 to 1986 _ from 20deaths per 1,000 births in 1970 to 10.4 per 1,000 births in 1986.Preliminary data for 1987 and 1988, however, show the decline isslowing. The mortality rate for black infants was 18 deaths per1,000 births in 1986, compared with 8.9 per 1,000 births for whites.   The report, a compilation of previously released material, alsosaid:   _Substantially more white women, 79 percent, and women of Asianand Pacific Islander descent, 76 percent, receive prenatal care inthe first three months of a pregnancy than black women, 62 percent,or American Indian women, 61 percent. Among Hispanic women, earlyprenatal care was highest among Cubans, 82 percent, and lowest amongPuerto Ricans, 57 percent.   _Births among unmarried women more than doubled from 1970 to1986, from 11 percent to 23 percent of all births. In 1986, 11percent of women of Asian and Pacific Islander descent who gavebirth were unmarried, compared with 16 percent of white women, 42percent of American Indian women and 61 percent of black women.   _Accidents, including those involving motor vehicles, were thefourth leading cause of death overall in 1986 and the most frequentcause of death among men under the age of 65.   _Although homicide ranks 12th among all causes for death, ittakes nearly as many lives as accidental injuries for black maleswho die before age 65.   _The suicide rate for white men in 1986 was nearly double that ofblack men. On average, 21 of each 100,000 deaths among white menwere suicides, compared with 12 for black men, 5 for white women and2 for black women.   _Influenza and pheunomia caused 28 of each 100,000 deaths amongblack men, far higher than the 18 per 100,000 rate posted for whitemen. Among black women, 13 of each 100,000 deaths were caused byinfluenza and pheunomia; among white women the number was 10.</TEXT></DOC>
