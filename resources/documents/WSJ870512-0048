Britain's trade and industry secretary, Paul Channon, said more than two million applicants wanted to buy 3.15 billion shares, although only 800 million shares in the aircraft-engine maker are available.    With the scaled-back allocations for individual investors, people who sought between 400 and 1,000 shares will receive 150, while those who wanted as many as 2,000 will receive 200. The allocations increase at a diminishing rate until those applying for between 20,000 and 100,000 shares will get 2.5% of the number sought, while those who wanted more than 100,000 shares will receive none.    Demand for the shares and the current strength of London's stock market should ensure that the shares open at a hefty premium when trading starts next Tuesday. The shares were priced at $2.83 each, but only half the amount is payable now, with the other half due in September.    Originally, 60% of the shares had been earmarked for institutions and 40% for the general public. </TEXT></DOC>
