(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Dave MethvinandM;Weitek Corp., already a leader in high-performance numeric processors for thePC, is expected to begin volume shipments of its Abacus 4167 chip this month.andO;The 4167 is designed to significantly increase the numeric processingcapabilities of 486-based systems.andP;  Nearly all 486 vendors include a socketfor the 4167 chip on their system boards.andM;The 4167 is upwardly compatible with Weitek's Abacus 3167 chip, which is usedto increase the numeric performance of 386-based systems.andM;Many vendors of 32-bit compilers and numeric applications support the Weitekproduct line.andM;With its built-in and highly optimized numeric processor, the 486 is noslouch when it comes to tackling complex numeric problems.andP;  However,engineers, scientists and financial analysts are demanding even betterperformance for their modeling and simulation work.andM;PC Week obtained an engineering sample of the 4167 chip from Weitek.andM;Performance tests were run on 33MHz 486 systems from AST Research Inc.,andO;Advanced Logic Research Inc., CSS Laboratories Inc. and Club AmericanTechnologies Inc.andM;PC Week's Math benchmark tests were used to evaluate each system.andP;  The Mathtests are Fortran programs compiled with a 486-aware optimizing compiler fromMicroWay Inc.andP;  The tests run as 32-bit protected-mode applications using thePhar Lap Inc.andP;  DOS extender.andP;  (For further information on the tests, see thePC Week Special Report, &quot;Putting 386 Power to Work,&quot; Nov.andP;  6, 1989.)andM;The Math results were impressive: A 486 with a 4167 installed could performmore than 16.5 million single-precision Whetstones per second.andP;  This was morethan twice as fast as the 7.5 million Whetstones for the 486's built-innumeric processor.andP;  For reference, an IBM 3090 mainframe can perform about 18million Whetstones per second.andM;One interesting note for owners of 33MHz 386 systems: A 33MHz 386 teamed withWeitek's 3167 has about the same numeric performance as a 33MHz 486 without a4167.andP;  That means number-crunching users should not consider an upgrade to a486 unless they also purchase a 4167.andM;Despite the many different approaches taken by the 486 manufacturers indesigning their memory architectures and caches, the results of the Mathtests differed by less than 10 percent on these 486 systems.andM;Officials at Weitek, of Sunnyvale, Calif., said third-party software vendorsare preparing new compilers that would yield even greater performanceincreases.andM;Kent McLean, product manager for NDP languages at MicroWay, located inKingston, Mass., confirmed that his company will release an improved suite of486 compilers by June.andM;&quot;We have seen performance improvements of up to 50 percent over 386 compilerson some tests,&quot; he said.andM;Weitek's 25MHz Abacus 4167 is priced at $1,395; the 33MHz version costs$1,695.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
