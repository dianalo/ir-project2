Herbert Zinn Jr., 18, of Chicago, was also ordered Tuesday byU.S. District Judge Paul Plunkett to pay a $10,000 fine and serve 2{years' probation.   Zinn was 17 when he broke into computers at ATandamp;T, NATO and theDefense Department. His case is one of the first ever brought underthe Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986.   ``Our intention is to prosecute such cases aggressively in thefuture,'' said U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas.   In sentencing Zinn, Plunkett said he hoped that the young man'sbrush with the law would direct his extraordinary computer skillstoward legal outlets.   Zinn was convicted Jan. 23 of breaking into ATandamp;T and U.S.government computers in three states, illegally copying more than$1.2 million worth of computer software, and of illegally publishingcomputer passwords on computer bulletin boards in Chicago and Texas.   Court documents indicate that Zinn, a high school dropout whoused the name Shadow Hawk, broke into ATandamp;T computers in suburbanNaperville and New Jersey, as well as NATO computers run by ATandamp;T inBurlington, N.C., and at Robbins Air Force Base in Georgia. Theintrusions took place from July to September 1987.   Zinn stole an estimated 55 computer programs, including complexprograms relating to artificial intelligence and computer designs,according to the court documents. No classified materials wereobtained, but the government regards the programs obtained by Zinnas ``highly sensitive.''   By entering the computers, Zinn caused $174,000 worth of damageto ATandamp;T equipment, according to the court documents.   Assistant U.S. Attorney William Cook said Zinn obtained access tothe ATandamp;T computers from underground computer bulletin boards.   Zinn was uncovered in 1987 when ATandamp;T security officials spottedhis telephone number and his messages in the computer bulletin boardsystem.</TEXT></DOC>
