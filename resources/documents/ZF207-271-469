Butterfield Road, Lombard, Ill.andP;  60148(312) 971-1212.andM;According to Users .andP;  .  .andM;A user at a major studio in Hollywood used AutoKey to set up easy-to-usemenus for her boss, whose PC is used to sign onto Documaster, a documentstorage and retrieval system under IBM's CICS; Fasttrack, adatabase-management system also under CICS; and Focus, a database systemunder IBM's TSO.andP;  ''He doesn't want to be bothered by all the keystrokesneeded for different systems,'' she said.andM;AutoKey takes little time to learn and implement, she added.andM;Automator miandM;Direct Technology Ltd.andM;Automator mi (for mainframe interface) is marketed both as a software robotand as a means to integrate PC-to-mainframe communications and PCapplications into a single environment, making both accessible from acustomized interface.andM;Users can teach Automator mi tasks as they do them, according to companyofficials.andP;  As tasks are carried out, LEarn, a memory-resident program,produces a source-code file in its Automator Control Language.andP;  These filesare executed by a run-time interpreter.andP;  Applications can be set to runautomatically based on specific times or events.andM;Automator mi runs on the IBM PC XT, AT, PS/2 and compatibles.andP;  It uses lessthan 82K bytes of RAM.andM;The package costs $1,995 for a full development pack.andP;  A single run-timelicense costs $200.andM;Direct Technology Ltd. is based in the United Kingdom.andP;  Its U.S.andP;  arm, DirectTechnology, is at 10 E. 21st St., Suite 1204/5, New York, N.Y.andP;  10010 (212)475-2747.andM;According to Users .andP;  .  .andM;At the Lutheran Brotherhood, a financial-services/insurance company inMinneapolis, Automator mi is used with Arbiter, Tangram Systems Corp.'scommunications package, to download ledgers from a mainframe to sales agentsin the field.andM;''Automator mi takes care of file-transfer procedures so that agents don'thave to know all the DOS commands,'' said Jay Pasch, network analyst at theLutheran Brotherhood.andP;  ''Arbiter has its own scripting language, but we wereso impressed by Automator we went with it.''andM;According to Pasch, the only drawback to Automator is that its LEarn facilitycan handle, at the most, a 16K-byte script module.andP;  ''If it goes higher thanthat, you have to start chaining modules together, which can get a littlemessy,'' he said.andM;Another user said she found the package to be ''incredibly versatile,''though compared with CDI Systems Inc.'s AutoKey, another software-robotpackage she uses, ''Automator mi is more of a programmer's language.andP;  AutoKeyis probably easier for someone to sit down and do.andP;  I've had personaltutoring with Automator mi and am still learning it.''andM;EaselandM;Interactive Images Inc.andM;Easel is marketed as a language that lets PC users build graphical,pointing-device user interfaces to host applications.andM;While Easel lets users record keystrokes and automate data transfer andextraction from the host, the emphasis is on the interface, which uses colorsymbols to simplify user access to applications across several systems.andP;  Thecompany claims that programmers with no PC experience can easily buildinterfaces.andM;Easel runs on IBM PCs, XTs, ATs, PS/2s and compatibles.andP;  It has built-incommunication to asynchronous (3270 or 5250) or VT100 environments.andM;A developers' kit starts at $24,900 and includes software, an IBM Model 12 orModel 14 PS/2 monitor with touch-screen and controller board installed, acommunications module, credit for one person to attend a four-day trainingseminar and three days of company assistance.andP;  Run-time programs cost between$450 and $995.andM;Interactive Images Inc. can be reached at 600 West Cummings Park, Woburn,Mass.andP;  01801 (617) 938-8440.andM;According to Users .andP;  .  .andM;Combustion Engineering Inc., a Stamford, Conn., builder of nuclear power andother energy plants, uses Easel at its Sherbrooke, Ontario, facility on PS/2Model 30s tied into a DEC VAXmate computer, according to Frederick Hyatt, amanufacturing computer consultant at the firm.andM;Many Combustion employees working on the shop floor are more comfortable withtouch-screens than with keyboards, Hyatt said.andM;Easel provides a touch-screen interface with menu selections providing accessto information needed on the floor.andM;Easel's software-robot capabilities are used by automatically downloading aweek's worth of data from a mainframe in Windsor, Conn., to a DEC computer inCanada.andP;  The VAXmate is used as a file server for the Model 30s, Hyatt said.andM;The firm looked at less expensive products but found that Easel was worth theextra cost, according to Hyatt.andP;  ''The touch-screen monitors, which theysupply, were better made.andP;  Also, Easel is easy to learn and efficient,'' hesaid.andM;The only improvement Hyatt suggested was to have Easel programs be removablefrom the run-time system so that they could be run separately.andM;Gateway PCandM;Software CorporationandM;Of AmericaandM;Gateway PC competes with both Executive Information System products andsoftware-robot packages, according to Patricia Zullo, account executive atSCA.andP;  It can work alone or in tandem with SCA's mainframe data-extractionproduct, Gateway Mainframe.andM;The product is designed to let users control mainframe, mini or LANcommunication sessions.andP;  End-user menus are prepared by technical-supportstaff rather than by users.andM;Gateway PC runs on IBM PCs, ATs, PS/2s, 3270 PCs and compatibles.andP;  ForPC-oriented applications only, without communications to another system, thepackage takes up about 18K bytes of memory.andP;  Mainframe communicationfunctions using scripting language may require as much as 320K bytes ofmemory.andM;A PC with 512K bytes of memory and a hard disk or two floppies isrecommended.andP;  Gateway PC supports DOS 2.0 and above.andM;File transfer and mainframe data extraction are available under IBM's VM,CICS and TSO.andP;  Gateway PC costs $350 per PC, not including file-transfercapabilities, with volume discounts available.andM;The file-transfer package costs $9,000 per CPU.andP;  Local area network pricingis also available.andM;Software Corporation of America is located at 800 Summer St., Stamford, Conn.andO;06901 (203) 359-2773.andM;According to Users .andP;  .  .andM;Philips 66 Co., in Bartlesville, Okla., used Gateway PC to build a customworkstation that provides executives with easy log-ons and simple access toinformation from both internal and external sources.andP;  ''We took Gateway PC'sscripting language and menuing tool and used it as theapplication-development tool for the workstation,'' said Bobby Culpepper, MISdevelopment director at Philips 66.andM;Philips 66 uses Gateway PC to download daily budget and production data onthe operation of oil wells from an IBM VM-driven mainframe to IBM PS/2sequipped with the Workstation Control Program.andM;The product is complex enough to require that technically proficient personsbuild the scripts, Culpepper said.andM;''We looked at all the big-name executive information systems before wedecided to build our own,'' he said.andP;  ''At the time, we didn't have a lot ofcash to go out and pay $250,000 for additional software.''andM;Also, the company had developed many fourth-generation language products thatmight have been hard to integrate with an off-the-shelf EIS, Culpepper said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
