The contract, which would be the first sale of a nuclear reactor since the Soviet Chernobyl accident in 1986, is a big coup for the West German consortium of Siemens AG and Asea Brown Boveri AG. Although many details must be worked out, the seven-year project is expected to have a value of more than 1 billion marks ($555.3 million). The Siemens-Asea share of that total could be several hundred million marks, sources at the companies said.    The accord is the largest and most significant of among 30 private business contracts expected to be signed by West German businessmen accompanying Chancellor Helmut Kohl on his summit trip to Moscow beginning today. West German-Soviet trade has declined in recent years, and West German businessmen want a share in what could be a gold mine as Mikhail Gorbachev seeks to restructure the Soviet economy.    Execution of a formal contract for the nuclear reactor is weeks and perhaps months away, Siemens sources said. But Soviet officials apparently agreed to commit in general terms to the joint project rather than miss the opportunity for a summit signing.    The contract is likely to raise a few eyebrows in Washington, where some congressmen have raised questions about the recent explosion in Western bank credits to the Kremlin. Strategically important nuclear technology is embargoed for sale to the East by Cocom, the 16-nation Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls that approves technology transfers to the Communist bloc. A Siemens spokesman said the reactor sale hadn't yet been submitted to Cocom and would have to be reviewed for approval.    Although other Western nations have received permission to export nuclear reactors to the East bloc, one Western diplomat predicted: &quot;The Cocom authorities will take a real hard look at this one.&quot;    However, if the sale goes through as generally expected, it will be a big victory for Siemens and Asea. The reactor, which is slated to begin operation in 1996 at Dimitrovgrad on the Volga River, will generate 200 megawatts of thermal power through a high-temperature process. Siemens and Asea this month formed a joint venture to market reactors of this type, which are operating at three demonstration sites. The Soviets, too, have been doing research on high-temperature reactors for several years. </TEXT></DOC>
