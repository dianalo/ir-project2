But there was alwaysEast Germany. The Democratic Republic's work force was highlyeducated. Most important, Europe's economic powerhouse, WestGermany, was right there, eager to reunite with the East andlead it into prosperous economic freedom.   What could go wrong?</LP><TEXT>   Practically everything could go wrong -- and did. In thelatest issue of the Brookings Papers on Economic Activity,George Akerlof and three other University of California,Berkeley, economists spell it out. Not long after thelong-awaited reunion, business output collapsed andunemployment soared. As Mr. Akerlof says, &quot;One of the worstand sharpest depressions in European history had begun. Itcontinues unabated.&quot;   Most important was a severe cost-price squeeze. Germanlabor unions, fearful of cheap East German wages, pushed upwages in the East. Before long, East German companiescouldn't sell their goods profitably to anyone.   The East Germans had been allowed to trade a lot of theirmarks for more valuable West German deutsche marks. The EastGermans used their new currency to buy in the West, not athome.   German Chancellor Helmut Kohl had estimated that it mighttake three or four years to bring East Germany up to theWest's living standard. That's surely optimistic. RobertBarro, a Harvard economist, figured on this page in May thatparity for the East may take &quot;a couple of generations ratherthan a couple of years or a couple of decades.&quot;   Meanwhile, all sorts of problems are growing.Treuhandanstalt is the agency that's supposed to privatizeEast Germany's state enterprises. On the terms the agencysets, it's having a hard time finding buyers. It probablycould find someone to buy the state firms' assets piecemeal,and it probably could sell the land the plants stand on. Butthe agency wants to preserve the jobs in the plants, andhardly any buyers would make such a commitment.   Costs are steadily mounting. Jobless benefits are high,running to two-thirds of normal wages or more. The governmentoffers subsidies to get companies to invest in the East. It'salso subsidizing the East German states to help them to paytheir bills and repair infrastructure.   The high costs of reunification have led to higher taxes,which haven't been at all popular in the West. In recentweeks some young Berliners have been seen wearing T-shirtsinscribed, &quot;I want my wall back.&quot; Chancellor Kohl was a heroright after reunification, but recent polls show hisChristian Democrats trailing the opposition Social Democrats,41% to 39%.   The East Germans fully recognize that they aren't aspopular in the West as they had expected to be. The Akerlofgroup polled East Germans and found that a large majority nowwould be unwilling to migrate to find work unless theyabsolutely had to.   How severe is the East German plight? At the time ofcurrency union, it was widely believed that about one-thirdof the East German firms would have to go out of business.Akerlof and company are far more pessimistic. Without massiveproductivity improvements or substantial subsidies, theyfigure most Eastern industry will have to shut down.   The only hope the Akerlof group can see is major wagesubsidies and massive government investment ininfrastructure, such as transportation. The group admits thecost would be heavy but figures it would be largely offset byreduced jobless benefits and higher tax payments.   Maybe so. But I found it interesting that commentators onthe paper at a Brookings session found the idea a little hardto swallow.   Rudiger Dornbusch, an MIT economist and the soul ofcontinental civility, had nice things to say about thepaper's assessment of East Germany's collapse but found thewage subsidy program breathtaking.   He notes that the authors' proposal, while it doesn'tflatly urge retaining the status quo, surely leans that way.&quot;East German firms are not organizations that ought to benurtured and preserved,&quot; he says. &quot;The sooner they are brokenup, the sooner we will see productivity growth andsustainable real wage gains.&quot;   If present East German firms were subsidized and sustainedat anything like their current level of effectiveness, it'shard to see where they would find customers. The East GermanTrabant, an automobile that has become a sort of Europeanjoke, sells at the same price as the much-superior VolkswagenGolf. At that price it's hard to see how any Trabants getsold.   Mr. Dornbusch suggests that it would be better to accept afew years of massive unemployment, while the East Germaneconomy is revamped.   There has been talk of an East German miracle that wouldreplicate the West German miracle in the post-World War IIperiod. But the West German miracle was based on free marketsand self-help, certainly not on wage subsidies.   The West German miracle wasn't painless, but it worked. Ifthere is to be any hope for East Germany, maybe it's time forsomeone to go back and start reviewing the post-World War IIscript.</TEXT></DOC>
