Weiss, an alleged participant in mortgage frauds that two years ago prompted BankAmerica Corp. to take a $95 million write-off, pleaded guilty to three counts of wire fraud, the U.S. attorney's office here said.    Mr. Weiss was an officer and half-owner of Covina, Calif.-based Energy Resources Financial, which brokered loans and posed as a lender of millions of dollars in loans pooled by National Mortgage Equity Corp., according to a filing in U.S. District Court here.    The court filing said that Mr. Weiss misled various investors into purchasing mortgage pass-through certificates that weren't properly insured and secured.    San Francisco-based BankAmerica's Bank of America unit acted as an escrow agent for pools of the loans, many of which were defaulted on. The bank subsequently made good on investors' losses, leading to the parent company's write-off. Bank of America fired five employees in connection with the transactions.    Mr. Weiss, who is scheduled to be sentenced in September, faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine for each count of wire fraud.    The U.S. attorney's office said Mr. Weiss is cooperating in a continuing investigation of the mortgage transactions. </TEXT></DOC>
