 Today the demand is for complex graphics imagesintegrated with heavily formatted text presented in multiple fonts.andP;  Thelanguage that has become the standard for describing complex pages isPostScript from Adobe Systems.andM;DEC has offered PostScript on a number of its laser printers for some time.andO;The smallest of these PostScript printers is the LN03R ScriptPrinter.andP;  Now,with the release of version 2.0 of its ScriptPrinter software, DEC hasgreatly increased the versatility of the ScriptPrinter.andP;  Along with other newfeatures, the ScriptPrinter can now operate through a terminal server andaccept LN03 setup modules.andP;  But its primary feature is still the ability toprovide host-resident translation of the ReGIS, ANSI and Tektronix 4010/4014graphics protocols.andM;JUST LIKE AN LN03?andM;This new version of the ScriptPrinter's software includes several significantenhancements.andP;  The most important one allows the ScriptPrinter to be operatedthrough a terminal server, just like a standard LN03.andM;Before version 2.0, users could operate the ScriptPrinter only when it washard-wired to a VAX.andP;  The VAX was the printer's exclusive owner; any printcommand that wasn't sent from the host node had to be routed through it.andO;Naturally, this made it difficult to use the printer in a networkingenvironment.andP;  The new version of the software makes the ScriptPrinteravailable to any device on a network that is licensed to use theScriptPrinter.andM;Another significant change is that the ScriptPrinter can now use the samesetup files and forms that are used on the LN03.andP;  Setup modules are files ina printer device control library (SYSDEVCTL.TLB, for an LN03) that includesuch page layout functions as font selection and type size.andP;  Forms caninclude setup modules and can set margins, length and width.andP;  TheScriptPrinter can handle the LN03's forms, but it can't utilize their marginsettings.andM;For example, if a particular form sets the type in 12-point Times and createsone-inch left and right margins on the LN03+, on the ScriptPrinter it willset the type in 12-point Times but it won't set any margins.andM;Originally, the ScriptPrinter could interpret only special setup fileswritten in PostScript, because the setup files were sent to the ScriptPrinterbefore the translator was engaged.andP;  Now, the translator is engaged before thesetup file for ANSI and PostScript jobs, enabling the ScriptPrinter totranslate ANSI setup files and forms into PostScript.andP;  For ReGIS andTektronix 4010/4014 print jobs, the ScriptPrinter still accepts onlyPostScript setup files.andM;The ScriptPrinter can't use the LN03's ANSI setup files until it identifiesthem properly.andP;  The printer assumes it is receiving PostScript files unlessit receives information indicating otherwise.andP;  To let the ScriptPrinter knowthat it is receiving ANSI files, the user must store the files in a separatelibrary, apart from the PostScript files, then define a logical name for thatlibrary indicating that it contains ANSI files.andM;Version 2.0 of the printer's software allows the user to define a devicecontrol library search list.andP;  For example, if POST$DEVCTL.TLB is the name ofthe PostScript library and ANSI$DEVCTL.TLB the name of the ANSI library, theuser can define a logical ALL$DEVCTL as follows: DEFINE/SYSTEM ALL$DEVCTLPOST$DEVCTL,&quot;ANSI$DEVCTL/DATA_TYPE=ANSI&quot;andM;The user should then change the ScriptPrinter's startup command file(CPS$STARTUP.COM) so that the INITIALIZE/QUEUE command includesLIBRARY=ALL$DEVCTL.andP;  This qualifier enables the ScriptPrinter's software tosearch both libraries for setup modules.andP;  The setup modules inANSI$DEVCTL.TLB will be identified to the printer as ANSI files.andM;Version 2.0 also includes several new print command line qualifiers.andP;  TheNUMBER_UP qualifier allows the user to print several pages of a document atreduced size on one sheet of paper (Fig.andP;  1).andP;  This feature can be used topreview the format of a large document to check for any formatting anomaliesor errors.andM;One of the most useful qualifiers is PRINT/PARAMETER=LAYUP.andP;  LAYUP definitionfiles are essentially forms written in PostScript, but they are far moreversatile than ordinary forms.andP;  They can be used to control page order, theinclusion of borders around a page and settings for all four margins.andP;  Likethe NUMBER_UP qualifier, LAYUP allows users to print multiple reduced pagesof a document on one sheet of paper.andM;The difference between a LAYUP file and a form is very slight.andP;  The maindifference is that forms are ANSI files, and LAYUP files are PostScript.andP;  Inaddition, forms are stored in the data file SYS$SYSTEM:JBCSYSQUEUE.DAT, andLAYUP text files are kept in a special directory, LPS$LAYUP.DIR.andP;  LAYUP filescan do virtually anything that forms can do.andM;System managers may appreciate the software's new accounting feature.andP;  TheScriptPrinter's print symbiont adds information about the ScriptPrinter tothe file SYS$MANAGER:ACCOUNTING.DAT.andP;  Using the VMS Accounting utility, thesystem manager can determine the number of physical pages printed and theuser name of the account from which the print command was issued, forinstance.andM;ScriptPrinter software version 2.0 is easily installed using the standardVMSINSTAL command procedure.andP;  The only caveat is that the terminal serverport to which the LN03R is attached must be set to SOFT type (non-ANSIprinter).andM;During the installation procedure, users can create several generic queuesfor every ScriptPrinter execution queue.andP;  Each of these generic queues caninclude a specific data type qualifier.andP;  Because the ScriptPrinter can handlefour file types, users can set up one generic queue for each type, includingone for ANSI, one for ReGIS and so on.andP;  Thus, users need never type the/PARAMETER=DATA_TYPE=ANSI qualifier.andP;  They can select a file type by simplyusing the /QUEUE= qualifier and specifying one of the generic queues.andM;The installation procedure then creates PostScript translators for eachgeneric queue.andP;  These translators reside on the VAX and change allnon-PostScript file types into PostScript.andM;The ScriptPrinter contains 29 resident fonts that can be called with theproper PostScript commands.andP;  Unlike the LN03, the ScriptPrinter doesn'tprovide a place to plug in external font cartridges.andP;  But, as with AppleComputer's LaserWriter, fonts can be downloaded to the printer, allowing theuser to access a virtually unlimited number of fonts.andP;  The ScriptPrinteraccepts Macintosh downloadable fonts.andP;  For the time being, PostScriptdownloadable fonts for the ScriptPrinter can be obtained only from AdobeSystems in a package of 14 fonts.andM;Unfortunately, the ScriptPrinter's emulation capabilities are gained at someloss of printing speed.andP;  We found that, except for very large jobs, theScriptPrinter printed ANSI files considerably more slowly than the LN03+(Fig.andP;  2).andM;The ScriptPrinter is rated at eight pages per minute.andP;  However, when aone-page ANSI file was submitted with the qualifier /COPIES=8, theScriptPrinter actually printed at 5.3 pages per minute.andP;  Naturally, when theinformation on each page of a document is different, performance will suffermore.andM;When an eight-page PostScript document was submitted, the ScriptPrinter tookthree minutes and 15 seconds to generate it.andP;  That's equivalent to 2.7 pagesa minute.andM;Increasing the size of the ANSI files increases the efficiency of theScriptWriter relative to the LN03+.andP;  Because the translation time remainsfairly constant, the time needed to translate data becomes a proportionatelysmaller part of the overall print time as the size of the print jobincreases.andM;The ScriptPrinter offers print support for ReGIS, ANSI and Tektronix4010/4014 printers.andP;  Its emulation of the Tektronix and ANSI printers in ourtests was accurate and clear.andM;The ReGIS emulation seemed at first to be rather peculiar.andP;  Althoughrecognizable, the representation of one test file--a converted sixelfile--was radically different from its appearance on a color monitor.andP;  Theprinter produced a black and white image (no gray tones) with white linesrunning horizontally and vertically through it (Fig.andP;  3).andM;According to DEC officials, these two problems--the lack of gray tones andthe appearance of white lines--most likely occurred because the test imagethat we sent to the printer was generated by a product that the ScriptPrinterdoesn't support.andP;  However, the image's format was completely standard.andM;The lack of gray tones can be explained by the constant intensity of thecolors in our test image.andP;  Colors can be mapped to different shades of grayonly when the intensity of the various colors is sufficiently different.andO;Intensity is determined by the amount of white in a color; less intensecolors have more white.andP;  The colors in our test document had a very lightintensity, therefore they didn't translate very well.andM;According to DEC officials, the intersecting lines appeared because the imagedid not map perfectly to the 300-dot-per-inch (dpi) resolution of theprinter.andM;EMULATIONandM;The ScriptPrinter is a PostScript printer with an Adobe Systems print engine,so it is capable of printing any PostScript document that users send to it.andO;Because the LaserWriter is also an Adobebased 300-dpi PostScript device, itmakes sense that the ScriptPrinter can emulate a LaserWriter.andM;Using Alisa Digital Print (ADP) software from Alisa Systems, we tested theScriptPrinter's Macintosh compatibility.andP;  The ADP software is installed usingthe VMSINSTAL command procedure.andP;  It assumes that the AppleTalk for VMSbridge is running and that the queue for the output printer is up.andM;Once the ADP installation is completed, the ScriptPrinter will appear in theMacintosh Chooser as a LaserWriter and can be selected just like aLaserWriter printer.andP;  What actually happens is that the Macintosh file issent to the PostScript queue on the VAX.andP;  Thanks to a special ApplePostScript dictionary that the ADP installation places in the ScriptPrinterlibrary, the ScriptPrinter is able to print the Macintosh file as though itwere a LaserWriter file.andM;It took as much as four minutes to print a page on any VAX-based Macintoshprint queue using a MicroVAX II.andP;  It took 12.5 minutes to send the file for athree-page document (created with the Macintosh desktop publishingapplication Quark Xpress) from our test Macintosh II to a MicroVAX runningunder VMS version 4.7.andP;  The Macintosh II was connected directly to Ethernet.andM;The ScriptPrinter turned out to be a fairly adept LaserWriter.andP;  Although weencountered some initial problems setting up the ADP software, theperformance of the ScriptPrinter was almost seamless.andP;  However, some of thecomplex print settings in the Quark Xpress file did lead to problems.andP;  Forexample, the printer balked at the demands placed on its 2MB of memory whenwe requested thumbnails at 200 percent enlargement.andM;JUST LIKE AN LN03RandM;As a PostScript device, the ScriptPrinter performed admirably, acceptingPostScript documents created in a text editor or exported from 20/20, a VAXspreadsheet application from Access Technology.andP;  It even accepted PostScriptdocuments that were created by Macintosh applications, copied to the VAX, andthen printed on the PostScript queue from there.andM;As an emulator, the ScriptPrinter is also an excellent find, handlingTektronix 4010/4014 and ANSI documents with equal skill, although print speedis slow.andM;Considering that it is essentially four printers in one package, the price ofthe ScriptPrinter is relatively low, at $5,233, which includes softwarelicensed for one printer.andP;  The upgrade needed to convert an LN03+ to aScriptPrinter is priced at $2,851, including version 2.0 of the ScriptPrintersoftware.andM;Although the ScriptPrinter is comparable to the LN03 and the LaserWriter, itis more than both of them combined.andM;Loaded with features, quiet and reliable, the ScriptPrinter is an admirablesolution for environments in which users employ multiple graphics protocolsand require high-quality output.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
