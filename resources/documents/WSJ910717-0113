In a political communique from this week's summit meetingof the so-called Group of Seven, the leaders backed the ideaof a peace conference that includes simultaneous discussionsbetween Israel and the Arab states, and Israel and thePalestinians. The communique also called on the Arabs tosuspend their boycott of Israel and for Israel to stopbuilding settlements in occupied territories.</LP><TEXT>   Expressing support for the &quot;principle of territory forpeace,&quot; the leaders said they &quot;attach overriding importanceto the launching of a process&quot; that achieves peace in theMideast. British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, noting thestrong language on the Middle East and other areas in thecommunique, said, &quot;I think practitioners will recognize thatthere is rather more meat in this political declaration thanis perhaps usual on these occasions.&quot;   The consensus on the Middle East, coming just beforeSecretary of State James Baker begins another round ofshuttle diplomacy in the region, was reached as leaderscontinued grappling over the urgency and nature of aid to thetroubled Soviet economy.   The leaders will meet with Soviet President MikhailGorbachev today. The seven countries have agreed to give Mr.Gorbachev a &quot;special relationship&quot; with the InternationalMonetary Fund and to provide certain technical assistance tomove the Soviet Union toward a free-market economy. But theU.S., Japan, Britain and Canada all insist on stopping shortof any mention of direct financial assistance right now.Germany, France and Italy, on the other hand, are eager toprovide some significant additional help to the Soviets soon.   &quot;This is a very important moment indeed,&quot; said NormanLamont, British chancellor of the exchequer, after a day ofmeetings in which the finance ministers and the heads ofstate of the seven nations discussed the Soviet issue. But hesaid &quot;many of the policy proposals&quot; made by Mr. Gorbachev ina letter to the leaders last week &quot;do need to be examined anddo need elaboration&quot; before the West can discuss further aid.   Mr. Baker said he didn't think &quot;you could get to a marketeconomy by simply providing assistance to a disintegratingcommand economy.&quot;   Others, however, suggested several ideas to give Mr.Gorbachev something substantial to take home. French FinanceMinister Pierre Beregovoy suggested that the Soviets be giventwice as much borrowing potential from the new European Bankfor Reconstruction and Development.   German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher said theSoviets might be given aid to modernize their oil and naturalgas production, to enable them to sell more of it to the Westand Japan in return for hard currency. And Italian ForeignMinister Gianni De Michelis said he couldn't understand whythe Soviet Union couldn't be a full member of the IMF, sinceCambodia and Romania already are. But these ideas faceresistance from the U.S. and Japan.   In his letter last week, Mr. Gorbachev suggested the needfor a multibillion-dollar stabilization fund to back a planto make the ruble convertible into other currencies, arestructuring of the Soviet's $65 billion in debts to theindustrial nations, and an &quot;infusion of goods&quot; to helpprevent shortages during a period of price liberalization.   None of those suggestions were discussed specifically inyesterday's meeting, the ministers said. But Mr. Baker saidhe wouldn't rule out the possibility of a stabilization fundat some future point, arguing that currency convertibilitywas a prerequisite for a market economy.   The Soviets are expected to ask, perhaps indirectly, formuch more than this. While Mr. Gorbachev didn't mention aspecific amount of money in his letter, Soviet Deputy PrimeMinister Vladimir Sherbakov indicated the Soviets might becoming to bargain. Mr. Sherbakov said in a BBC televisioninterview that &quot;if we were given $20 billion to $30 billion ayear, I'd be willing to carry out a more radical program&quot; ofreform.   Yesterday's political communique bypassed the dispute overSoviet aid and focused instead on some of the world'sregional conflicts. Specifically, the seven declared theirintention to maintain sanctions against Iraq until Iraq fullycomplies with all &quot;relevant&quot; United Nations resolutionsgoverning the Gulf War cease-fire.   The communique also lauded the recent changes in SouthAfrica and urged all parties to work to end the violencethere. And in language urged by both the U.S. and Britain,the communique noted &quot;an urgent need to restore growth to the{South African} economy to help reduce inequalities of wealthand opportunity.&quot; The document said South Africa needs topursue &quot;new economic, investment and other policies thatpermit normal access to all sources of foreign borrowing,&quot;and called on the international community to support suchchanges.   Among its other provisions, the communique supported anenhanced role for the U.N. in meeting both internationalsecurity and humanitarian problems. The summit partnerscalled for the U.N. to appoint a high-ranking official todirect an international response to emergencies. In aseparate document, the group urged a series of arms-controlprinciples and measures that include a U.N. registry oftransfers of conventional weapons. The registry would helpsignal any attempts &quot;by a state to build up holdings ofconventional weapons beyond a reasonable level.&quot;   The economic communique, to be published today, isexpected to predict a strong world recovery starting in thesecond half of this year. It is also expected to state theleaders' hope to conclude the currently stalled Uruguay Roundof trade negotiations by the end of this year. But withlittle progress reported on any of the trade issuesoutstanding, that goal may be overly optimistic.   ---   Philip Revzin contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
