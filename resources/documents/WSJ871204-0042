MossbergStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/04/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> FOREIGN-EXCHANGE MARKETS (FRX)MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON)EXECUTIVE (EXE) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Reagan, in a televised interview last night, offered a convoluted and partly erroneous explanation of the dollar's recent fall, forcing the White House to issue a correction.    Asked what he would &quot;say or do&quot; to stop the greenback from falling further, Mr. Reagan restated recent remarks, saying, &quot;I don't think we've done anything to contribute to its falling further,&quot; and adding, &quot;we're interested in stabilization.&quot;    He then blamed the dollar's decline on lower interest rates overseas. He said &quot;a sudden surge of cutting interest rates in some of our trading allies abroad, did have the effect again of making the dollar fall. But that was their doing, not ours.&quot;    But the dollar generally rises when America's major economic partners cut interest rates, because investors then find U.S. interest rates more attractive and buy dollars so they can invest here.    While Mr. Reagan was taping the interview yesterday afternoon, the dollar was rising in reaction to just such a &quot;surge&quot; of European interest-rate cuts announced yesterday. Those cuts have come at the urging of the Reagan administration.    After a pre-broadcast transcript of the interview was released to reporters, a White House spokesman said: &quot;The president was mistaken. Where he said 'fall' he meant 'rise.'&quot;    The president also appeared to suggest that the problem wasn't that the dollar was weakening against other currencies, but that other currencies are strengthening against the dollar.    He said: &quot;It isn't a case of where sometimes in the past when it was certainly overpriced, that we have made efforts to balance it up. I've often wondered sometimes -- they keep talking about the government, or the dollar falling, or is it maybe that some of those foreign currencies that were way below value have come up to where they properly should be.&quot;    Last night's incident was the second time this year that the White House press office has had to clarify Mr. Reagan's statements on the dollar.    In June, after the Venice economic summit, Mr. Reagan told a televised news conference there was room for the dollar to fall further. The currency began dropping in international markets, and the White House issued a statement saying Mr. Reagan had meant that the U.S. favored dollar stability. </TEXT></DOC>
