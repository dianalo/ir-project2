Gloyd,president and chief executive officer, said.   Such earnings, for the period ended March 2, are up 4% to11% at $4 million to $4.3 million, and conform with analystexpectations. The increase comes on projected sales of about$49 million, which would represent a 2.3% gain from theyear-earlier period.</LP><TEXT>   In the year-earlier quarter, the maker of filters andpackaging products had net income of $3.9 million, or 39cents a share, on revenue of $47.9 million.   Clarcor last fiscal year completed a significantrestructuring -- selling off noncore holdings such as itsservices group and plastic-injection molding operations, andaltering the strategic direction of the remaining segments.   While still significant, the packaging operation -- whichhad been the corporate centerpiece when Clarcor was known asJ.L. Clark Manufacturing Co. -- became overshadowed by therapid expansion of the company's filtration-productsdivision, which management has identified as having thebiggest growth potential.   The Baldwin segment of filter operation supplies equipmentfor heavy-duty vehicles; other segments vend such things asfilters for locomotives, and microscopic filters to brewersand food processors, and to electronics and pharmaceuticalmanufacturers. Sales for the filter segment are up about 7.5%from the year-ago period, Mr. Gloyd said in an interview.   &quot;That's an indication of market share gain,&quot; he said. &quot;Wehave a major competitor working four days {a week}, and we'reworking overtime and building a new plant.&quot; The company'sproducts currently hold less than 10% of any market, Mr.Gloyd said, adding that Clarcor thinks the field still offers&quot;a big opportunity for growth.&quot;   The unit's strategy calls for it to develop niche marketsas well: Mr. Gloyd said Clarcor expects to make gains inselling filters to farmers who grow mushrooms underground,for example, and considers filters for use inasbestos-abatement programs another promising field.Filtration products represented just under half of 1990sales, and about two-thirds of operating profit.   The consumer products operation, which makes metal andplastic containers, promotional products, and plasticclosures, saw &quot;just under a double-digit increase in sales&quot;in the latest quarter, Mr. Gloyd said, and a more than 50%increase in operating earnings.</TEXT></DOC>
