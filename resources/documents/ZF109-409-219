(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Conventional integrated circuit wafer test probes have mechanical andelectrical weaknesses, especially for testing high-frequency or high-speeddevices and chips that have large numbers of inputs and outputs.andP;  Membraneprobe technology overcomes most of these limitations.andM;WAFER TEST TERMINOLOGY and practices vary between IC manufacturers.andP;  However,most test procedures fall into one of two general categories: parametrictesting and die-sort testing.andM;Parametric testing is intended to check basic device data such as thresholdvoltages and sheet resistances.andP;  It is performed on special patterns, knownas test chips, included on the wafers.andP;  For a given wafer or wafer lot,passing the parametric test is a necessary but not sufficient condition foryield.andM;Die-sort testing is performed on all individual chips to sort out the goodfrom the bad.andP;  It is normally designed as a sequence of increasingly complexroutines so that gross failures are detected early and test time is notwasted on useless chips.andP;  Ideally, die sorting culminates in an at-speed testthat exercises the chips at a frequency at least as high as the intendedapplication.andP;  This way, the manufacturer ascertains that the parts willperform to specifications before more resources are spent on their packaging.andM;The hardware involved in either of the above processes typically consists ofan electronic tester, which executes the test program, a prober, whichperforms the mechanical manipulation of the wafers, and a probe card, whichprovides the electromechanical interface between the tester and the deviceunder test (DUT).andP;  Usually, the probe card is connected to the tester via aprinted circuit board known as the probe-card motherboard or the performanceboard, which is customized for individual ICs or IC families.andM;The test software is the multitude of programs that control the electronictester, commanding it to apply to the inputs of the DLJT specificcombinations of voltages and currents (known as test vectors), and to measurecertain voltages, currents, and time intervals at the outputs of the chip.andO;The measured responses are then compared with predetermined allowed ranges,and accepted or rejected accordingly.andM;Testing High-Performance DevicesandM;Wafer test requirements vary with a number of factors.andP;  For example, certainspecifics are dictated by the technology (bipolar, MOS, GaAs), byfunctionality (logic, memory, linear), by the nature of the signal (digital,analog, mixed-signal), and by other factors.andP;  In any of these categories,there are typically a majority of low-to-moderate performance products and asmaller number of high-performance ones.andP;  The definition of what constitutesa high-performance IC may not always be clear.andP;  However, at least for wafertesting, two categories of chips pose known challenges: devices with highinput/output (I/O) counts and ICs designed to operate at high frequencies orhigh switching speeds.andM;Despite the fact that the probe card is the smallest and least expensivecomponent of the test setup, it is usually the main cause of the difficultiesexperienced in testing high-performance devices.andP;  Specifically, when thenumber of contact pads on the chip is greater than about 150, and/or when thecontact pads are spaced particularly closely, it is difficult or impossibleto procure conventional probe cards that will work reliably in factoryconditions.andP;  Also, when the operating frequency or switching speed is high,the probe card's parasitic effects can distort the test conditions as well asthe measurement results.andM;Distortions resulting from probe-card parasitic effects can occur when eitherof the following conditions is present:andM;*  The wavelength of the highest significant frequency is of the same orderas the linear dimensions of the probe.andP;  When this is true, at any giveninstant the voltages and currents at different points of the probe can besubstantially different.andP;  In this case the probe represents a transmissionline section, in which such phenomena as signal reflections can becomedominant.andM;*  Parasitic reactances in the probes are sufficiently high to redistributethe circuit voltages and currents.andP;  In digital the same criterion isformulated differently; namely, one is faced with a high-speed testingsituation when the DUT switches faster than the time constant of the circuitcontaining the parasitic reactance.andM;Chip makers sometimes circumvent the difficulty of obtaining high-pin-countprobe cards by using self-test, so that only a subset of the pads needs to beaccessed.andP;  However, this approach imposes a penalty in wafer &quot;real estate&quot;and results in incomplete test coverage.andP;  No way to circumvent the signalintegrity problem has yet been found.andM;Failure to perform at-speed testing at the wafer level leads to the wastefulpackaging and retesting of a certain volume of bad chips that could have beenidentified and rejected earlier.andP;  Depending on the complexity of the part andon the signal frequencies involved, that fraction can be as high as 10% ofthe total.andP;  The financial impact depends on the incremental packaging andtesting cost.andP;  To illustrate the magnitude of the problem, consider thefollowing conditions, which are not unusual for a high-performance IC:andM;Annual production volume: 100,000 chipsandM;Fraction of rejects at packaged test: 10%andM;Cost of packaging per chip: $100andM;Cost of final test per chip: $2andM;Total waste per year: $1,020,000.andM;Hence, the availability of at-speed testing capability at the wafer level isof pressing importance to the IC industry, and the main element of thatobjective is the development of an IC probe card capable of addressing alarge number of inputs and outputs and of maintaining signal integrity for awide range of frequencies and operating speeds.andP;  To develop such atechnology, it is necessary to identify and formulate the problems preventingconventional probe cards from delivering the needed peformance.andM;Conventional Probe Card TechnologyandM;A conventional wafer probe card consists of a set of fine styli, or probes,mounted on a carrier substrate, typically a printed circuit board.andP;  Theprobes are arranged so that their tips form a pattern identical to that ofthe DUT's contact pads.andP;  The outward ends of the probes are soldered totraces on the carrier printed circuit board, which extend to a connector thatinterfaces the probe card with the performance board.andM;The probe card is normally mounted face down on the prober, which brings thewafer to be tested to a position under the probe card, aligns it so that itscontact pads are against the tips of the probes, and raises the wafer untilcontact is made.andP;  In practical conditions the tips of the probes may not beprecisely in the same plane, and the probe card may not be exactly coplanarwith the surface of the DUT.andP;  To compensate for such variations, the proberraises the wafer beyond first contact by a controlled amount, called theoverdrive.andM;The probes on the probe card are usually held at a low angle to the plane ofthe DUT, so that when they are pushed by the wafer, the tips slide along thesurfaces of the pads.andP;  This horizontal movement, called scrub, helps removethe oxide films on the surface to ensure good electrical contact, and is animportant element in the art of wafer probing.andM;A number of variations on this basic technology exist, which attempt toimprove the mechanical and electrical performance of the probe card.andP;  In someadvanced versions, the carrier printed circuit board is designed to provide acontrolled-impedance environment in which each trace presents a section oftransmission line of known characteristic impedance.andP;  A schematicillustration of a line on a conventional probe card is shown in Fig.andP;  la.andM;Conventional probe cards have a number of inherent limitations.andP;  Some arerelated to their mechanical properties and others to their electricalperformance.andP;  Mechanical Limitations.andP;  Because the contact element, theprobe, is a thin long structural member, it tends to change its spatiallocation under the repeated stresses of normal operation.andP;  Consequently, theuser needs to realign the probes in the horizontal plane and along thevertical axis after some number of touchdowns.andP;  This tedious operationtranslates to a significant increase in the cost of ownership.andP;  At higherprobe densities the problem of maintaining registration is furtheraggravated.andP;  High densities require that the individual probes be made eventhinner, longer, and closer together.andP;  Such conditions are not only moreconducive to the loss of registration, but they also make the realignmentprocedure too sensitive to be performed by the user, and the probe cards needto be returned to the factory for costly maintenance.andM;Electrical Limitations.andP;  The equivalent circuit of a single line in aconventional probe card is shown in Fig.andP;  lb.andP;  Here, Lp is the inductance ofthe probe and [Z.sub.O] is the characteristic impedance of the transmissionline formed by the trace and the ground plane on the printed circuit boardcarrier.andP;  Typical values of these parameters are: Lp = 10 nH and [Z.sub.O] =50 Ohms.andP;  Such a line may be used either to transmit a signal from the testerto a DUT input (or from a DUT output to the tester), or to supply a power ora ground connection to the DUT.andP;  We will discuss its behavior in each ofthese two situations.andM;Fig.andP;  2a shows the equivalent circuit of a conventional probe card in asimplified input-connection configuration.andP;  (An output connection would notbe much different in principle.) In the frequency domain, the parasiticinductance Lp of the probe causes the circuit to behave like the low-passfilter shown in Fig.andP;  2b, and determines the bandwidth of that filter.andO;Assuming matched conditions, the upper 3-dB limit of the band is thefrequency f at which:andM;([2.pi.f])(2[L.sub.p]) = [Z.sub.O].andM;For [Z.sub.O] = 5011 and Lp = 10 nH we find the bandwidth to be about 400MHz.andM;The effect of the needle inductance in a high-speed switching situation isbetter illustrated in the time domain (see Fig.andP;  3).andP;  When the tester sendsto the DUT a pulse stimulus having a rise time t,,, the signal received atthe input of the DUT will have a longer rise time, [t.sub.rr], because of thecircuit's parasitic inductance 2Lp.andP;  The increase in rise time isapproximately 2.2 times the time constant 2Lp/ [Z.sub.O], or about 1 ns.andM;Generally, a circuit's bandwidth BW and its effect on the rise time t, arerelated by the known expression:andM;BW(3-dB) = K/[t.sub.r],andM;where K is a constant that ranges between 0.35 and 0.45.andP;  With this in mind,the bandwidth and the rise time can be used interchangeably.andM;Waveform deterioration is not the only problem caused by the parasiticinductances of the probes.andP;  In Fig.andP;  2a, the chip ground node and the testerground node are not always at the same electrical potential.andP;  This can leadto erroneous testing and/or to unwanted coupling between different signallines served by a common ground probe.andP;  Another problem is that thediscontinuity between the probe and the transmission line causes multiplereflections of the signal, which result in a long settling time.andP;  Also, themutual inductance and the coupling capacitance between the long unshieldedneedles contribute to unacceptable levels of cross talk between the signallines.andM;In the case when a line of a conventional probe card is used for powerdelivery, the high inductance of the probe can cause significant variationsin the voltage levels of both the bias line and the associated groundconnection.andP;  Consider, for example, the circuit of Fig.andP;  4, in which thepower line is at a voltage V. If the DUT switches a current I in a timeinterval dt, a voltage dV will develop across each of the probes, temporarilyreducing the voltage across the DUT to V - 2dV.andP;  This change in the voltagecan be roughly expressed as:andM;dV = [L.sub.p.I]/dt.andM;For example, when eight drivers are simultaneously switching 10 mA each in 1ns, and the probe inductance is 10 nH, the power supply disturbance 2dV willbe in excess of 1.5V.andM;In addition to the just-described phenomenon, the voltage drop developingacross the parasitic inductance of the ground connection again causes thechip's ground potential to deviate temporarily from that of the tester.andP;  Thedifference, known as the ground bounce, is coupled into other signal lines asunwanted and unpredictable noise.andM;Requirements for High-Peformance Probe CardsandM;Based on the analysis of the present probe-card technology and itsshortcomings on the one hand, and of the current and future needs of theindustry on the other, one can formulate the requirements for the moreadvanced probe card that is needed.andP;  Since the shortcomings of existingprobes have been identified as pertaining to the areas of contact density andsignal fidelity, it is natural to define the incremental requirements in thesame terms.andM;Requirements related to contact density include:andM;* The technology should allow the creation of a large number of contactpoints (more than 500).andM;* The minimum contact pitch, that is, the center-to-center distance betweenthe closest contact points, should be as low as 0.004 inch.andM;* The contact points should have a fixed alignment in the plane parallel tothe wafer under test.andM;* The contact points should be able to move with respect to each other in theverical direction to accommodate normal variations in wafer topography.andO;Requirements related to electrical performance include:andM;* The bandwidth of a line should be at least 10 to 20 times the clock rate ofthe targeted digital systems (i.e., 2 to 3 GHz).andM;* A controlled-impedance, reflectionless electrical environment should extendfrom the tester to within at most 1 mm from the I/O pads of the DUT.andM;* The uncompensated inductance of the contact must not exceed 0.1 nH.andM;* The cross talk between adjacent lines should be at least two orders ofmagnitude less than in a conventional probe card of the same density.andM;Membrane Probe ConceptandM;The membrane probe is a proprietary wafer probing technology developed atHewlett-Packard's Circuit Technology Randamp;D Laboratories as a solution to thehigh-performance wafer-level test problems described above.andP;  The concept ofthe membrane probe card is depicted in Fig.andP;  5.andP;  As shown in theillustration, a thin and flexible dielectric film (a membrane) supports a setof microstrip transmission lines that connect the DUT to the testelectronics.andP;  Each microstrip transmission line is formed by a conductortrace and a common ground plane positioned on the opposite side of theflexible membrane.andP;  The conductor traces and the ground plane are patternedon the membrane using photolithographic techniques.andM;Given the thickness and the material of the membrane, the width of a signaltrace is chosen to obtain the desired characteristic impedance [Z.sub.O] ofthe microstrip transmission line.andP;  Typical values of [Z.sub.O] in common useare 50 and 75 ohms.andM;Contact to the DLJT is made by an array of microcontacts which are plated upat the ends of the transmission lines through holes in the insulatingmembrane.andP;  The membrane is operated under low tension in a drumheadconfiguration so as to planarize the contact array.andP;  The tension in themembrane is carefully controlled to allow a degree of independent motion ofthe contact points in the vertical direction, thus accommodating smallvariations in the heights of the contacts or in the topology of the deviceunder test.andM;With regard to the need for higher pin counts and contact densities, themembrane probe card technology offers a quantum jump in comparison with theconventional technology.andP;  In the membrane probe, the leads and the contactpoints are created by photolitographic means with inherently high resolutionand positioning accuracy.andP;  This allows the creation of fine, dense patterns,and makes the manufacturing process, and ultimately the cost, virtuallyindependent of the complexity of the pattern.andM;Since the contact points are fixed on a common carrier (the membrane), theyare fundamentally aligned for life in both the vertical direction and in theplane of the DUT.andP;  This eliminates the need for probe realignment, which isan extremely labor-intensive and costly operation in the conventionaltechnology.andM;In the area of electrical performance, the membrane probe technology presentsan equally significant advance.andP;  The transmission-line configuration extendsall the way to within 0.1 mm of the DUT's I/O pads, thus providing acarefully controlled electrical environment in practically the entire path ofthe signal.andP;  There is very little uncompensated lead inductance to causewaveform degradation or power or ground potential bounce, or to generatesignal coupling through a common ground inductance.andM;Furthermore, the presence of a ground plane so close to the leadsconcentrates the electric field under the traces, which minimizes thecoupling capacitance between them, thus greatly reducing cross talk.andO;Architecture of the Membrane ProbeandM;The architecture of the membrane probe card is shown in Fig.andP;  6.andP;  Themembrane, configured as described above, is attached to aprinted-circuit-board carrier, which also carries termination resistors,bypass capacitors, or any other necessary components.andP;  A force deliverymechanism is mounted on the printed circuit board carrier and is designed toperform three distinct and independent functions:andM;* Apply a force to the microcontacts sufficient to obtain a low and stablecontact resistance.andM;* Activate a scrubbing motion to ensure the removal of surface insulatinglayers, including oxides, from the surface of the DUT.andM;* Provide the mechanical degrees of freedom necessary to ensure continuousconformance of the plane of the microcontacts to the plane of the DUT.andM;The required contact force is exerted on the membrane by the two leaf springsshown in Fig.andP;  6 through a rigid translator ring attached to the membrane.andO;The primary factor determining the total force needed is the force percontact, so the total force depends on the number of contact pads in the DUTand is set by a proper choice of leaf spring thickness.andP;  It was empiricallydetermined that for the selected bump material to make a low-resistancecontact with aluminum (the most widely used pad material in ICs), the forceper bump must be at least 10 grams.andP;  Taking this into account along withother considerations, the range was determined to be 15 [+ or -]  5 grams.andM;As mentioned earlier, the scrubbing motion of the contact bumps with respectto the probed surface is of critical importance to obtaining a low, stable,and repeatable contact resistance, especially with non-noble materials.andP;  Foraluminum, the minimal acceptable scrub action was found to be about 10micrometers.andP;  The upper limit is defined by the size of the contact pads onthe DUT, and for most practical cases is about 25 [micro-m].andP;  In the membraneprobe, the scrub action is built into the force delivery mechanism ratherthan implemented using external actuators.andM;The compliance of the probe's contact points to the surface of the DUT isperhaps the most critical prerequisite for successful probing.andP;  Theimportance of compliance stems from the fact that in practical conditions theposition of the probe card in the prober can never be adjusted accuratelyenough to make it perfectly coplanar with the wafer's surface.andP;  Even if suchan adjustment could be made, every wafer has a different bow and taper, andtherefore presents a new surface to the probe.andP;  It is impractical to readjustthe probe for every wafer.andM;In the conventional wire probe, compliance is achieved naturally&quot; because thelong needles are flexible and there is virtually no mechanical linkagebetween individual contact points.andP;  In the membrane probe, special provisionsneed to be made to achieve adequate surface compliance.andP;  These provisionsmust accommodate two modes of deviation from coplanarity: a short-range modeand a long-range mode.andP;  The short-range mode consists mainly of variations inthe bump height and in the topography of the DUT.andP;  The long-range mode is ageneral tilt of the probe's surface with respect to the plane of the DUT.andO;The two modes are fundamentally independent of each other.andP;  The forcedelivery mechanism of the membrane probe has been designed to provide bothshort-range and long-range compliance with the DUT surface at every touchdownthrough independently acting micromechanical means.andM;At the outer edge of the printed circuit board carrier, connectors areprovided to interface with the tester's performance board.andP;  The size andshape of the probe's printed circuit board carrier and the type of interfaceconnector are different for different probe/tester combinations, but the coreremains the same.andM;Performance of the Membrane Probe CardandM;The performance of the membrane probe card has been fully characterized bothparametrically and in actual use at alpha sites.andP;  A parametric evaluation isone that is carried out in the laboratory under controlled conditions, and isbased on special test structures designed for the purpose.andP;  The products of aparametric evaluation are the basic parameters of the tested probe card.andO;They reflect its intrinsic qualities, and are independent of the othercomponents involved (tester, DUT, etc.).andP;  Examples of parametric measurementsare characteristic impedance and bandwidth.andM;An alpha-site evaluation is one in which the probe card is used to test areal IC in a factory atmosphere in conjunction with all the other componentsof the test setup.andP;  Its purpose is to verify the probe card's performance anduncover any issues that may occur in realistic conditions.andP;  ParametricEvaluation.andP;  The parametric evaluation of the membrane probe card coveredboth its dc and its ac properties.andP;  The dc parameters measured were thecontact resistance and the current carrying capacity.andP;  The ac parameters werethe characteristic impedance, the bandwidth, the pulse rise time, and thecross talk between lines.andM;Contact resistance was evaluated by measuring the total resistance betweenone of the probe card's lines and an aluminized silicon wafer, thensubtracting the known trace resistance.andP;  Aluminum (as a 1-pm-thick film) waschosen for two reasons.andP;  First, it is the most widely used IC metallization,and second, it is the most difficult metal to make contact with because ofits propensity for oxide formation.andM;A plot of the contact resistance to aluminum as a function of the number oftouchdowns is shown in Fig.andP;  7.andP;  As can be seen, the contact resistanceremains low and fairly constant for over 20,000 touchdowns.andP;  It then startsto deteriorate as oxide debris accumulates on the microcontacts.andP;  After asimple cleaning, however, the low resistance is restored and the behavior isrepeated.andP;  An important utility of this plot is that it defines the cleaningfrequency required to attain stable performance.andP;  Membrane probes were foundto deliver low and stable contact resistance for up to 1 million touchdownswhen cleaned once every 20,000 cycles.andM;Current carrying capability of a trace was defined as the dc current that canbe continuously passed through that trace without an observable change in itsappearance.andP;  For a standard signal line the current carrying capability wasfound to be about 300 mA and was relatively independent of trace thickness inthe range of 0.5 to 1 oz/ft&quot;.andP;  Coincidentally, roughly the same currentcarrying capability was measured for the contact between the bump and thewafer's aluminum metallization.andP;  However, in this case it was defined as themaximum dc current at which no hysteresis is observed in the VIcharacteristic curve.andM;Characteristic impedance measurements were made using time-domainreflectometry  (TDR).andP;  The TDR profile of a signal line is shown in Fig.andP;  8.andO;Parts of the plot corresponding to various sections of the circuit aremarked: a 5011 controlled-impedance connector, the trace on the probe card'sprinted circuit board carrier, and the microstrip line on the membrane.andO;According to this TDR signature, taken with a 50-ps system, thecharacteristic impedance of the line tested is within  /-lo% of the targetvalue of 50il.andM;Transmission response to a 50-ps step function excitation was recorded forthe same 50fl signal line and is shown in Fig.andP;  9.andP;  The 10-to-90% rise timeof the response was determined to be about 180 ps, a considerable fraction ofwhich occurs in the 80-to-90% region.andP;  Bandwidth measurements were made byplotting the frequency response curve of one of the membrane probe card'slines.andP;  This curve, also known as a Bode plot, is shown in Fig.andP;  10.andP;  The3-dB bandwidth of the tested line was found to be in the range of 2.5 to 3.0GHz.andP;  Cross talk between the probe card's lines was measured as a function offrequency, and the results are plotted in Fig.andP;  11.andP;  The measurements weremade on a card containing 272 traces, which gives an idea of the spatialdensity of the lines in this case.andP;  One of the two curves shown is foradjacent lines, while the other curve is for alternate lines.andP;  At 100 MHz thecross talk is - 45 dB for adjacent lines and - 78 dB for alternate lines.andP;  Incomparison, a conventional wire probe card showed adjacent-line cross talk of- 38 dB at a density less than one third that of the membrane probe card ofFig.andP;  11.andM;Alpha-Site Testing.andP;  A number of membrane probe cards were fabricated to testspecific chips of various technologies, I/O counts, pad metallurgies, andfunctionality.andP;  The testing of these chips was conducted in HP's waferfabrication plants.andP;  Below is a brief description of the tests and theirresults.andM;1.andP;  Bipolar ECL Flash Analog-to-Digital Converter.andP;  This 1.5watt,mixed-signal chip with 50 I/O pads and gold metallization was tested at a10-MHz sampling rate using a tungsten wire probe card.andP;  It was then retestedwith the membrane probe card, and the test results were compared.andP;  Thesuperior accuracy of the membrane probe card is demonstrated by Fig.andP;  12.andP;  Inthis plot, the voltage at test point 1, denoted here as Vtp1, is recorded fora sample of 120 dice.andP;  This voltage is offset from the chip ground by thedrop across a forward-biased junction, and its measurement is intended todetect variations in the chip's ground potential.andP;  The results show aprogressive deterioration in the stability of the measurements made with thewire probe card, while the membrane probe card measurements are consistentover the entire test.andM;The accuracy of the membrane probe data was confirmed by packaging a numberof dice and repeating the measurements on the packaged parts.andP;  The spread ofthe membrane probe card measurements translates to a contact resistancestability of better than 5 mil, which is 40 times better than that of thewire probe card.andM;The membrane probe's ability to make repeated touchdowns on the same diewithout appreciable damage to the pads is illustrated by Fig.andP;  13.andP;  For 200touchdowns the total variation is less than 1.2 MV, which corresponds to acontact resistance variation of 6 m Ohms.andP;  By contrast, using a wire probefor more than two touchdowns on the same chip usually causes enough damage torender the pads unbondable.andP;  This capability is of significant value to chipmanufacturers, who sometimes lose up to 5% of their chips to pad andpassivation damage.andM;2.andP;  Bipolar ECL Digital-to-Analog Converter.andP;  This represented an at-speedanalog test of an industry standard product using the HP 9840 VHF lineartester and the membrane probe card shown in Fig.andP;  14.andP;  The analog outputresponse of the device at a 10-MHz clock rate is presented in Fig.andP;  15 forboth the membrane probe card and a conventional counterpart.andP;  The rise andfall times are about the same at 1.3 and 1.0 ns respectively (they areessentially determined by the switching characteristics of the device ratherthan by the probe's performance).andP;  However, the settling time measured by themembrane probe card is only 9 ns compared with 32 ns for the conventionalprobe card.andP;  This significant difference is a result of the improvedimpedance matching in the membrane probe card.andM;3.andP;  NMOS CPU.andP;  A membrane probe card was used to test a 32-bit microprocessorat 85C (Fig.andP;  16).andP;  The 8.4-mm-square, 15-watt chip has 272 peripheralaluminum pads arranged in two staggered rows at an effective pitch of 110 [micro-m].andP;  This type of device has very large current transients, and thestability of power buses is of special concern.andM;The device was normally tested at speed only after packaging.andP;  With themembrane probe card, it became possible to run the at-speed package test onthe wafer for the first time.andP;  Careful membrane layout and close positioningof over 130 bypass and termination components helped obtain the desiredperformance.andM;4.andP;  CMOS ASIC.andP;  In this alpha-site test, a membrane probe card was used totest high-pin-count ASICs (application specific ICs) before TAB (tapeautomated bonding) innerlead bonding.andP;  The probe card addressed 180 gold mesabumps, each 75  Lm square, placed on a 150-/Am pitch.andM;One part of the test was designed to evaluate the membrane probe card'sfitness for the specific purpose of probing bumped wafers.andP;  In that part, 600passes were made on one wafer, which had about 100 dice.andP;  The average contactresistance variation was found to be less than 13 milliohms, and nosignificant damage to the gold bumps on the wafer was observed.andP;  Attempts torepeat the same test with a conventional wire probe card failed after onlyabout 5000 touchdowns.andP;  The gold bumps on the wafer were severely damaged,especially at the edges, and the probe needles went go badly out of alignmentthat on-site repair was no longer feasible.andM;One benefit of using the membrane probe card to test bumped wafers is theprobe's ability to detect individual short bumps, a commonly encountereddefect.andP;  Such bumps, if undetected, would cause assembly rejects at thesubsequent inner-lead bonding step.andM;ConclusionsandM;An advanced wafer probing technology, the membrane probe card, has beendeveloped in response to an increasingly acute problem in the IC industry.andO;The technology allows at-speed testing of high-performance integratedcircuits at the wafer level, and significantly extends the limits of pincount and density that can be accessed by the IC test engineer.andP;  The newprobe card has been fully evaluated, parametrically as well as in a number ofalpha sites.andP;  AcknowledgmentsandM;Key members of the membrane probe development team were Betty Belloli, SamBurriesci, Brian Elliott, Michael Greenstein, and Rick Huff.andP;
