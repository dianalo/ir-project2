(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The United Mine Workers' president saidTuesday he was willing to resume negotiations with The Pittston CoalGroup, and a House subcommittee said it would investigate strikesthat slashed U.S. coal production 35 percent.   State police were mobilized in southern West Virginia, wherevehicles were stoned and shots were fired at non-union mines.   UMW President Richard Trumka said he was accepting Virginia Gov.Gerald Baliles' request that the union and Pittston resumenegotiations under the supervision of a federal mediator, withTrumka and Pittston Co. Chairman Paul Douglas heading thenegotiating teams. Pittston Coal Group President Michael Odom saidthe company had no comment on the proposal.   ``At the appropriate time, we'll make a response,'' Odom said.Pittston has rejected other requests that the two sides resume talksor that Douglas become personally involved in the negotiations.   In Washington, U.S. Rep. William Clay, D-Mo., said the HouseSubcommittee on Labor Management Relations would begin aninvestigation into the Pittston strike.   ``Given the length of the strike, the number of workers involved,the protracted involvement of both the state and federal courts andthe potential effect of the strike on the economy, I believe it istime for a congressional investigation of the matter,'' Clay said.   More than 30,000 UMW members have been on wildcat strikesthroughout Appalachia and the Midwest in support of 1,900 unionmembers on strike against Pittston in Virginia, West Virginia andKentucky.   The U.S. Energy Information Agency reported that U.S. coalproduction fell 35 percent in eastern coal fields during the weekending July 1, with production in West Virginia down 37 percent frompre-strike levels _ from 3 million tons in June before the wildcatstrikes began to 1.9 million.   Earlier Tuesday, about 75 to 100 pickets gathered outside thenon-union Marrowbone Development Corp. mine in Mingo County, companypresident John Hill said.   ``The windshield was knocked out of my pickup truck by a rock,''Hill said. ``At least one other employee had a windshield and sidewindow broken. There were nails ... thrown on the road and there wasat least one flattened tire.''   Hampden Coal Co. officials reported gunfire at their non-unionMingo County mine Monday night and Tuesday morning. No injuries werereported.   State police referred questions on the incidents to spokesman RicRobinson.   State police Lt. Col. G.R. Young said extra officers were beingtransferred from West Virginia's eastern and northern panhandlesinto the southern part of the state because of violence there, butwould not say how many were being sent.   Trumka last week invoked a three-day ``memorial period,'' andTuesday was the midpoint. Under the national coal contract, Trumkaasked union miners east of the Mississippi to stay off the jobthrough Wednesday.   In another development, U.S. District Judge William Beatty inAlton, Ill., delayed until Friday a decision on a National LaborRelations Board request that he order most of Illinois' strikingcoal miners back to work.   ``I am going to give you the opportunity to demonstrate to meyour good faith,'' Beatty told UMW representatives in a courtroompacked with miners, many in camouflage gear.   But he added, ``If the law is such, I will not hesitate to issuethat temporary restraining order'' sought by the NLRB, whichcontends the wildcat strike represents an illegal secondary boycott.   Steve Yokich, an attorney representing a UMW district and localsin Illinois, told Beatty some recent developments may ``lead to theconclusion that at the end of a cooling-off period, we might nothave a dispute to deal with.''</TEXT></DOC>
