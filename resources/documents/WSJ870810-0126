Destruction and deportation are not new tactics. Since 1975, three-quarters of a million Kurds have been chased from their homes; 300,000 became refugees in Iran after the Barzani revolution; more than 500,000 were deported from their mountains in the north of the country to the arid deserts in the south. The intent: to dilute the concentration of 3.2 million indigenous Kurds, to remove the Kurdish presence from the oil-rich area of Kirkuk (on Kurdish lands), to shrink Kurdish ancestral lands. Between January and November 1985, 55,000 Kurds were victimized by forcible deportation. Thus far in 1987, 12,500 families have been forced to evacuate their villages.    Amnesty International regularly reports the detention, torture, execution and disappearances that have become the Kurdish way of life -- and death -- in Iraq. According to Amnesty, between August and October 1983, 8,000 Kurds in the Barzan area disappeared. Residents aged nine to 88 were arrested, and entire families packed into military trucks and driven to southern deserts after being paraded as traitors in the streets. Their fate remains a mystery.    In October 1985, the Iraqi authorities arrested 300 children between the ages of nine and 14 in the city of Sulaimaniya to force from them the whereabouts of Kurdish fighters or the identity of family members who supported the Kurdish resistance movement. Amnesty noted that the whereabouts of these children had been unknown until January 1987, when the bodies of 29 children were returned to their families with visible signs of torture by electric shock, beatings, whippings and sexual abuse -- some with their eyes gouged out. Those who did not succumb to the torture had been executed. Amnesty reports that the total number of missing children may have risen to 450 (Amnesty Bulletins, February and March 1987).    On July 14, 1977, in a moving address to the United Nations, Roger Baldwin of the International League for Human Rights said, &quot;I shall not recite the tragic tale of deception, dispossession, deportation, humiliation and forced labor inflicted on some 300,000 Kurds . . . in an apparent effort to annihilate the Kurdish ethnic group in Iraq. . . .&quot;    That was a decade ago under the regime that still holds the reigns of power.
