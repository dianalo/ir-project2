The politicization of the conference contrasts with thefirst such gathering six years ago in Atlanta. With eachyear, the epidemic has grown and its social impact has loomedlarger on the conference agenda.</LP><TEXT>   The trend seems headed toward a climax June 19 with abattle over the U.S. policy that blocks people infected withthe human immunodeficiency virus from entering the nationunless they get a waiver from current visa requirements.   In response to criticism of the policy, the Bushadministration has whittled a series of compromises,culminating in creation of a special 10-day visas that willallow foreigners to attend designated conferences withouthaving to declare on an immigration form whether they areHIV-positive. The gesture was tepidly received.   Dana Van Gorder, conference spokesman, says the action mayeven exacerbate the problem. &quot;Clearly, no one would choose toget a 10-day visa unless they were infected,&quot; he says;requesting one becomes an act of self-exposure.   And it's not only activists who oppose the travelrestrictions. The U.S. policy has been criticized by theWorld Health Organization and by the European Parliament,which urged the conference be moved to a country that doesn'tdiscriminate. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control, notingthat AIDS isn't casually transmitted, proposed a broad changein immigration policy, removing AIDS and other sex andbloodborne ailments from the restricted list.   The administration contends that because Congress addedAIDS to the contagious disease list, it's up to Congress totake it off.   More than 85 groups now plan to boycott the conference,including the International Red Cross, International PlannedParenthood, the government of Switzerland, the FrenchMinistry of Health, the state of Hawaii, the National Gay andLesbian Task Force, and the Gay Men's Health Crisis of NewYork City. The first scientist to isolate the virus, LucMontagnier of the Pasteur Institute in Paris, has hinted hemay stay away in protest. So far there are 6,000 registeredparticipants -- less than half the attendance of last year'sconference in Montreal.   &quot;We'd love to go and make a presentation, but morally wecan't,&quot; says Robert Bray, spokesman for the National Gay andLesbian Task Force. He predicts &quot;a showdown&quot; by WHO over theadministration's policy, as well as &quot;confrontations at theconference steps.&quot;   He questions the president's refusal to attend a meetingtraditionally opened by heads of state. &quot;The first person toboycott the Sixth International AIDS Conference was GeorgeBush. If he can go to Medellin, amid violent drug cartels,why can he not come to San Francisco?&quot;   Martin Delaney, the head of San Francisco-based ProjectInform, plans to attend the meeting to give a speech, butproposes demonstrations. &quot;I'm urging civil disobediance atports of entry, to shut down customs at Kennedy Airport andSan Francisco International airport,&quot; he says.   Conference organizers say they're trying to locate spacenear Moscone Center, the conference site, where demonstratorscould be isolated to prevent them from blocking traffic.   &quot;Moscone Center will be a miniversion of a police state,&quot;predicts Larry Kramer, a New York playwright and a founder ofthe activist group AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power. In aneditorial entitled &quot;A Call to Riot&quot; that was syndicated ingay newspapers around the country, Mr. Kramer has called formajor disruptions at the meeting.   Mr. Kramer acknowledges that the article was &quot;hyperbolic.&quot;But in an interview he said, &quot;It hurts me to say I think thetime for violence has now arrived.&quot; He adds: &quot;I don'tpersonally think I'm the guy with the guts to do it, but I'dlike to see an AIDS terrorist army, like the Irgun which ledto the state of Israel.&quot;   ACT UP officially repudiates such talk. &quot;Our policy isnonviolent, peaceful demonstrations. We may be noisy, but wewon't throw things or push people,&quot; says a spokesman AlanBeck. &quot;We may stage sit-ins to stop proceedings, but we'llhave nothing to do with {rioting}.&quot;   Violence is shunned by almost every other AIDSorganization. &quot;Our group upholds principles of nonviolenceput forward by Martin Luther King Jr.,&quot; says Mr. Bray of thetask force. Moreover, he adds, &quot;Violence isn't pragmatic. Wedecry it.&quot;   &quot;Riot would be unfortunate,&quot; says Jean McGuire, executivedirector of the AIDS Action Counsel, a Washington-basedlobbying group. &quot;I believe the past combination of streettheater, juxtaposed with quiet lobbying behind the scenes hasbeen a help. The squeaky wheel gets the grease. But angeronly goes so far.&quot;   Paul Volberding, a San Francisco AIDS researcher andconference organizer, predicts, &quot;The conference is going tobe a good one. It's not a convention, but a scientificconference, with new material to convey.&quot;   &quot;Those who disrupt the proceedings are doing the world ofAIDS a disservice,&quot; he says. &quot;It would be hard to understandif the groups claiming to represent people with AIDS didn'tallow the exchange of information. They should want to hearit too. It could save lives.&quot;   June Osborne, head of the National Commission on AIDS anddean of the University of Michigan's School of Public Health,is lobbying for an end to travel restrictions. Dr. Osbornesays she holds out hope for a bill introduced by Rep. RoyRowland (D., Ga.) removing AIDS from the list of diseasesbarring entry to the U.S.   &quot;I understand the frustration,&quot; she says. &quot;Science doesn'tjust mean those people with research grants. Progress demandsa blending of traditional voices, with those of people withwith HIV disease.&quot;   However, Dr. Osborne declares it is &quot;incongruous to attacka scientific meeting&quot; over a policy set by bureaucrats. &quot;It'sawful to see the anguish of {conference organizers} thattheir meeting could be desecrated.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
