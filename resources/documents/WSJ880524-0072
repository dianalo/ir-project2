Miller (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> LABOR ABS ASC LKS </CO><IN> RFD TNM </IN><TEXT>   The wave of acquisitions and leveraged buy-outs sweeping the grocery industry won't have much impact on consumers, but workers have sometimes paid a heavy price.    Moreover, union officials and industry analysts doubt management claims that the newly debt-laden companies can stay competitive in a business with historically razor-thin profit margins.    American Stores Co.'s planned $2.51 billion acquisition of Lucky Stores Inc., announced Friday, will make the Salt Lake City supermarket giant the latest chain to incur a large increase in its debt load. In recent years, managements of several other chains, including Safeway Stores Inc., Stop andamp; Shop Inc., and Supermarkets General Corp., have borrowed billions of dollars to elude hostile takeover bids by taking their companies private through leveraged buy-outs. A number of smaller publicly held chains have also borrowed to go private, for various reasons.    As a result, one analyst estimates that the ratio of debt-to-total capitalization for the nation's top eight supermarket chains will be 56% at year end, including the proposed Lucky/American Stores merger, compared with 40% five years ago. In contrast, the analyst, Edward Comeau of Wood Gundy Ltd., predicts the same group's capital spending as a percentage of assets will fall to about 7.7% from 10.7% in 1983. &quot;Leveraged supermarkets have their growth cut out from under them,&quot; he says.    Corporate raiders, particularly the Haft family of Landover, Md., began chasing grocery chains when they recognized in them a number of attractive attributes: their big and relatively recession-proof cash flow lets them service a lot of debt, they often have undervalued real estate assets that can be sold off, and the decentralized nature of their operations permits easy detachment and sale of underperforming units.    Those same factors make lenders eager to back leveraged buy-outs, so big pools of money are available both to raiders and jittery management. In a leveraged buy-out, a group of investors acquires a company largely with debt financing that is repaid with funds generated from the company's operations or through asset-sales.    Industry insiders say the supermarket business is so fragmented and ferociously competitive that raising prices to widen margins simply isn't an option for the debt-heavy chains, no matter how big they are. So shoppers needn't fear that the ongoing leveraging of the industry means an end to discount coupons or price wars.    And despite the huge sales American Stores will have on becoming the nation's biggest chain after its merger with Lucky, consumer concern that the industry will consolidate into an oligopoly remains far-fetched. That's because few economies of scale exist in the industry beyond a relatively small geographic region, and because federal law prohibits big companies from forcing lower prices from suppliers.    So to service the debt, companies must find ways to pare costs, and workers in the labor-intensive industry often bear the brunt of such efforts. When Lucky, based in Dublin, Calif., was struggling to elude an earlier takeover attempt by New York investor Asher B. Edelman, the chain wanted to sell its troubled Gemco operation in a hurry to raise cash for a stock buy-back. Lucky then closed its Gemco stores, dismissed 14,000 union workers and sold the outlets to a unit of Dayton Hudson Corp., which reopened them with a non-union work force. After Safeway went private through a $4.2 billion buy-out in 1986, it bailed out of the Dallas market and about 7,000 union jobs were lost. When Safeway sold a number of other regional operations, buyers made their purchase contingent on a promise that the union contracts would be renegotiated.    Although not all companies seek concessions from labor or sell off operations once a buy-out has been completed, William Olwell, head of collective bargaining for the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, says the buy-out trend has had &quot;a substantial negative impact&quot; on workers. However, he contends Safeway has shown &quot;compassion&quot; for its workers since the Dallas fiasco by agreeing to seek buyers for its divested operations who will recognize the union.    While workers fear the immediate threat of layoffs, union-busting efforts or forced contract concessions, they also worry about their leveraged employers' ability to compete over the long run, says Leslie Nulty, an economist for the United Food Workers. &quot;Funds that used to be available for capital investment are now diverted to interest payments,&quot; she says.    But workers aren't the only ones concerned about capital investment. &quot;You can't defer debt service, but you can defer maintenance,&quot; says Thomas W. Wilson, a director at the New York management consulting firm of McKinsey andamp; Co. That's shortsighted, he says, because with its increasing reliance on warehouse automation, scanners, and computerization, &quot;the grocery industry is becoming more capitalintensive, not less.&quot; Mr. Wilson says &quot;the logical question on these LBO's is whether they can maintain the competitiveness of their assets, and whether they have sufficient cash flows to continue to invest in physical assets.&quot;    Mr. Comeau, the Wood Gundy analyst, says the &quot;leverage in the supermarket industry is bad for those who have it, and good for those who don't.&quot; He says Albertson's Inc.'s position as one of the few under-leveraged players left in the competitive Southern California marketplace &quot;bodes well&quot; for the Boise, Idaho, company's earnings prospects.    Management officials at the newly leveraged companies downplay concerns about capital investment. Jeffrey Girard, chief financial officer at Supermarkets General, said while &quot;there will be adjustments&quot; to capital investment &quot;we intend to continue opening new stores and completing major renovations in substantially similar numbers&quot; as prior to its 1987 buy-out. He says Supermarkets General went private on the assumption that the action wouldn't damage its competitive posture.    A spokesman for Safeway also denies that its capital outlays have suffered because of its buy-out. Safeway, based in Oakland, Calif., recently disclosed that its downsizing and cost-cutting efforts have trimmed its debt to $3.36 billion from $5.01 billion. The chain's progress in reducing its debt is widely considered on Wall Street to be a prelude to a public offering, perhaps as early as this summer. Analysts think some of the other big grocery chains that have gone private may follow suit. But warns one industry expert, who asked not to be named: &quot;Virtually all leveraged deals are based on a fairly optimistic set of economic assumptions.&quot; If competition increases or consumer spending falters, leveraged companies are &quot;closer to the edge.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
