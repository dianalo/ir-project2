People had to leave to find work. In Taunton _ the largestlanded city in the state with 50 square miles _ they even had toleave to find a movie theater.   Mayor Richard Johnson recalls that things got so bad thatTaunton not only had no theaters, it had no hotel. Unemploymentballooned to 14 percent.   The community decline has largely been reversed in a boomingeconomic turnaround that has revived Massachusetts cities and townslike Taunton, 35 miles to the south of Boston, Fitchburg to thewest and Lowell to the north.   ``He started putting people on buses,'' Johnson says of Gov.Michael Dukakis' personal effort to spark a revival.   Dukakis claims a large measure of credit for this``Massachusetts Miracle'' as he campaigns for the White House.Economists generally applaud his efforts but agree thatcircumstances and pure luck have made life better for Rita Pires,Al Souza, Tom Clark and thousands like them _ even as Dukakishelped things along.   ``I was hurting financially,'' said Souza, who was forced intoretirement at age 55 but found work in Taunton's revival. ``I thinkhe's (Dukakis) done well for this community.''   But the living isn't so easy for the Parsons and Parhams andmany other blue-collar families who can't afford to buy a homebecause the prosperity has sent Boston-area house prices soaring.Between them, the Parsons, who have three children, make $21,000 ayear. The Parhams earn $35,000.   ``I feel like it has gone down,'' Terry Parson said of herstandard of living in a state where jobs are so plentiful thatMcDonald's is offering $7 an hour. ``I feel I'm going backward.I've been priced out of the market.''   The Parham family lives in a high crime area and the parentsworry for the safety of their 7-year-old daughter. ``We have tostay here until things get a little better for us,'' said BettyParham. ``I don't let my kid out unless I take her to the park orsomewhere.'' Although the rate of violent crime in Massachusettshas dropped and is low among major industrial states, it's nosolace for the Parhams.   ``It's just unsafe for her to go in front of the door,'' BettyParham said of her daughter.   Harvard economist Ronald F. Ferguson said that while life isbetter under Dukakis, it's best for higher income people. ``It'snot that the lower income people don't have jobs, but the cost ofliving remains high and it makes it difficult for them to make endsmeet.''   Economists say Dukakis took advantage of the sudden prosperityand benefited by association. The Dukakis campaign has been airingtelevision ads that boast he reversed the state's economic slide.In one ad, an announcer proclaims:   ``He turned around a 10-year economic slide and created a boomthat has made Massachusetts one of the hottest economies in thecountry. He brought people together, created over 400,000 jobs andpushed personal income to the highest levels in the nation. Heerased a massive deficit, balanced 10 budgets in a row and cuttaxes five times. It wasn't a miracle, it was leadership.''   That may be reaching too far. When the state was on the brink ofdisaster in the early 1970s with the unemployment rate at more than11 percent, a loss of more than 100,000 manufacturing jobs intextiles and apparel and huge budget deficits, no one, not evenDukakis, knew what forces were at work to change the economy fromrusting low-tech to gleaming hi-tech, according to David Lampe. Hedirects the industrial liaison program at the MassachusettsInstitute of Technology.   What happened next, most people agree, had little to do withDukakis. The computer industry found the smart people and placeslike MIT and Harvard in a state rich with talent and schools.Commercial banks and venture capitalists were willing to bet onthem. A big market was waiting.   ``That was the engine of change, the source of new jobs,'' Lampesaid. ``The state had little role in causing the change. Nogovernor can engineer an economic change as large as the one calledthe `Massachusetts Miracle.' It evolved out of the resources inthis region including a concentration of universities and a largenumber of defense contracts.''   Taunton's Mayor Johnson, a Democrat but no ally of Dukakis, saysthe governor committed money to link that city to InterstateHighway 495, a key to its economic recovery. Dukakis, he says,found companies looking to expand and arranged tours for theirexecutives.   One of those executives was John C.C. Fan, a physicist from MITwho didn't know Dukakis and who had no idea where Taunton was.Backed by venture capital, Fan, a Chinese immigrant, had justformed the Kopin Corp., which makes wafers for the electronicsindustry.   ``I don't know how the governor knew I had started thecompany,'' said Fan. ``He called me at MIT and asked me to go downand see him at the Statehouse. He encouraged me to go to Tauntonbecause of a new industrial park. The financial package was veryattractive.''   Johnson says the city's industrial park grew from six companiesin 1982 to 52 today, creating 5,000 new jobs that dropped theunemployment rate to less than 4 percent now.   Taunton's population grew by 5,000 to nearly 50,000. New taxrevenues allowed the city to invest $6 million in its publicbuildings and schools and to replace more than 50 miles of100-year-old water lines.   Down the road at Fitchburg, which received state and federalfunds to bring its downtown back to life, Mayor Jeffrey Bean said,``People seem to be doing much better now than they were 10 yearsago. These grants and programs encouraged business to come intoMassachusetts.''   Hubert Jones, dean of the School of Social Work at BostonUniversity, says Dukakis did a good job in increasing stategovernment contracts to minority organizations and in improvinghuman services.   ``Dukakis pumped more money into human services than any otheradministration in my memory,'' Jones said. ``Mike Dukakis has beena good governor the second time around. I think he came back andcorrected some big mistakes.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sept 30</NOTE></DOC>
