Shapero was a big winner in the U.S. Supreme Court last term, but he's learning that the High Court's opinion isn't necessarily the final word.    Mr. Shapero, a Louisville, Ky., lawyer, won the right last June to mail solicitation letters to potential clients. But since his Supreme Court victory, Mr. Shapero complains, the Kentucky Bar Association has prevented him from exercising that right.    Mr. Shapero says that the bar group has refused to approve about a dozen different letters that he has submitted. &quot;I don't begrudge folks the right to be opposed to advertising,&quot; Mr. Shapero says. &quot;But the Supreme Court said I was right and they shouldn't get in my way.&quot;    Lindsey Ingram, a Lexington, Ky., lawyer who is a member of the association's advertising commission, explains that, despite the Supreme Court ruling, the bar association retains the power to regulate lawyers' mailings. And so far the association has found Mr. Shapero's pitches objectionable.    In one letter, for example, Mr. Shapero addressed individuals whose homes were about to be foreclosed on. He suggested that he could put them into bankruptcy to prevent foreclosure. Mr. Ingram says the association was concerned that, at least for some clients, bankruptcy would not be a viable option. Kentucky's guidelines require that the targeted letters be accurate.    Meanwhile, since the Supreme Court's ruling, more lawyers across the nation are using direct-mail pitches to attract clients, according to state bar associations. &quot;It's definitely caught on,&quot; Mr. Ingram says.    When Pressed for Time,   Declare a Mistrial   LIKE SO MANY busy people, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Stephen Lachs had to be in two places at the same time earlier this month. He was presiding over a cocaine-possession trial but had promised to attend a family-law meeting at the American Bar Association convention in Toronto.    The solution? Judge Lachs declared a mistrial and took off for Toronto.    Lawyers in the case say the judge indicated at the outset of the trial that he was pressed for time. And defense attorney Michael Carney blames the snafu on the prosecution, claiming it took too long to put on its case. &quot;In the spectrum of what we are dealing with, it is not the major case of the year,&quot; he says.    But prosecutors were shocked and have threatened to turn the matter over to the state Commission on Judicial Performance for possible disciplinary action. A hearing to see if the cocaine case can be heard again is set for Sept. 2, but prosecutors fear that another trial would be impossible because it would expose the defendant to double jeopardy. The defendant faced up to four years in prison.    Judge Lachs, meanwhile, declined comment, citing the possible disciplinary complaint.    Survey Studies Payments   To Outside Counsel   HOW MUCH DO big corporations pay their chief outside counsel? Figures are hard to come by because, as a rule, neither the corporation nor the law firm is required to disclose the total. But a recent survey published in the trade journal Of Counsel sheds some light on the question.    Of Counsel compiled a list of each publicly traded company that has a lawyer on its board of directors. These companies are required to disclose legal fees when those fees exceed 5% of the law firm's gross revenue.    The list of top fees that emerged for fiscal 1987 included $9,946,000 from Wells Fargo andamp; Co., San Francisco, to Brobeck, Phleger andamp; Harrison; $9,584,327 from Manufacturers Hanover Corp., New York, to Simpson Thacher andamp; Bartlett; and $5,434,730 from Coca-Cola Co., Atlanta, to King andamp; Spalding. There were 11 additional seven-figure fees listed.    The list doesn't include fees paid by any company that doesn't have a lawyer on its board, and also doesn't include fees -- however large -- that don't exceed 5% of the law firm's gross revenue.    Yet based on the limited information available, it seems clear that even law firms with major corporate clients are attempting not to put all of their eggs in one basket. In most of the client relationships listed, the client's business accounted for less than 10% of the law firm's gross revenue.    Perils of Promotion   In a Promotional Age   PRESS RELEASES about lawyers are flooding newspaper offices as the profession becomes more aggressive about marketing. But one recent release stands out -- in part as a cautionary tale to anyone who doesn't keep track of what his public-relations firm is saying about him.    That firm, Dobisky Associates, wrote seeking publicity for University of Miami law professor Terence Anderson, who is representing federal judge Alcee Hastings in his efforts to fight impeachment charges. The firm's release compared Mr. Anderson to Harvard Law's star litigators Alan Dershowitz and Laurence Tribe. But it then explained that what Mr. Anderson really seeks is a low profile. Commenting on his relationship with the judge, Mr. Anderson said in the release: &quot;I think the reason we get along so well is that I'm not out to make a name on his back.&quot;    So why the publicity drive? Mr. Anderson pleads ignorant. He says -- and Dobisky Associates confirms -- he was never shown the release, which was commissioned by the university, and learned of it from a reporter. &quot;I think there's something very odd about it. It sounds kind of pompous,&quot; Mr. Anderson agrees. </TEXT></DOC>
