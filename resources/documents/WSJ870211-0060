HadCharge in 4th QuarterRelated to Disputes</HL><DD> 02/11/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> SNSEARNINGS (ERN) </IN><DATELINE> ROCKFORD, Ill.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Sundstrand Corp. said it took an after-tax charge in the fourth quarter of $31.7 million, or $1.69 a share, as a provision for expenses related to disputes with the federal government.    The maker of aerospace parts and power transmissions said it has been told by the government that it isn't complying with certain cost-accounting standards and federal acquisition regulations. The company also said it is the subject of two federal grand jury investigations that it believes are related to overhead costs associated with government contracts.    Ted Ross, Sundstrand's vice president of finance, said the government seeks lower overhead rates than commercial customers receive.    Sundstrand said it believes adequate provisions have been made to cover any litigation that might arise from these disputes, which could last for an extended period of time. The company also said that it has changed its procedures to minimize future disagreements with the government.    In the fourth quarter, Sundstrand had an $11.5 million net loss, including the $31.7 million charge, compared with net income of $22.9 million, or $1.23 a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 6.2% to $397.7 million from $374.4 million.    For the year, Sundstrand earnings fell 39% to $45.4 million, or $2.42 a share, from $74.4 million, or $4.02 a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 12% to $1.43 billion from $1.28 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
