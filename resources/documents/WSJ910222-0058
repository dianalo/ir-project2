The East fears being forgotten by the West, and notwithout reason. &quot;After the initial enthusiasm, we're allignoring Eastern Europe -- both politically andeconomically,&quot; says Gianni de Michelis, Italy's foreignminister.</LP><TEXT>   While democratization and privatization continue atvarying paces in the former Soviet bloc countries, massiveWestern investment hasn't materialized anywhere except informer East Germany. Romanian banker Dan Pascariu, in Parison a recent trip to drum up foreign interest, says there hasbeen no major investment in his country since the overthrowof Nicolae Ceausescu 14 months ago. Rules are being writtenand laws changed to make it easier, he says, but &quot;Romania isprobably last on anybody's list.&quot;   Even countries that might be higher on the list don't seeovernight benefits. Hungary, which has been writing new lawsand rules for 10 years, received half of all foreigninvestment in East Europe last year, says Foreign TradeMinister Bela Kadar. But that was only $500 million, he says,or less than 2% of the country's total capital assets.   &quot;{Hungarians} see themselves worse off after the firstphase of reform, so they're unhappy,&quot; he says. &quot;After 45years of communism, we've finally become a developingcountry, but we're not going to be Switzerland forgenerations yet.&quot;   Western banks, burned by huge unrepaid loans to the Eastin the past, have left the region. The Bank for InternationalSettlements says loans from banks to Eastern Europe declinedduring the first nine months of 1990.   &quot;During the 1970s and 1980s the West gave the East $170billion in loans, before any political changes,&quot; says GyorgySuranyi, president of the National Bank of Hungary. &quot;So we'rejust asking the West not to treat the new democraticallyelected regimes worse than they treated the old Communistregimes.&quot;   An estimated $60 billion in government aid has been givenor pledged, &quot;but most of this can't be used yet because theinfrastructures of the East can't absorb it,&quot; says JacquesAttali, president-designate of the European Bank for RegionalDevelopment.   Western bankers and businessmen say they can't plan biginvestments until Eastern economies have stable currenciesand the countries decide who owns what through massiveprivatization. The process has been sluggish. Poland couldprivatize only five companies out of thousands last year, andhopes to privatize 20 this year.   Polish Prime Minister Jan Krzysztof Bielecki says the Westcould prod the East not only with cash, but also with theincentive of a reward. &quot;The people have borne pain and willcontinue to bear pain,&quot; he says, referring to fallingincomes, high prices and rising unemployment. He wants a firmcommitment that Poland will be admitted to the EuropeanCommunity when its reform is completed.   But as the EC plans economic and monetary union for its 12members, and plots some sort of political union in theaftermath of the Gulf war, pleas for membership from Poland,Hungary and Czechoslovakia evoke an embarrassed silence inBrussels. Officials say associate or full membership for Eastbloc countries may be possible, but only in the next century.Hungary hopes to apply in 1996, Mr. Kadar says, but heconcedes that if Hungary adopted all EC free-trade rules,&quot;60% of our industry would collapse overnight.&quot;   Meanwhile, possible chaos in the Soviet Union strikesterror in its neighbors. &quot;The problems of the Soviet Unionare a catastrophe for us,&quot; says Czech Foreign Minister JiriDienstbier. &quot;We depend on their oil, and if there is acollapse there, we will be strangled.&quot;   None of the countries predict a return to Soviet-mandatedcommunism, but they all worry about rising public unease overprice hikes and joblessness. Anders Aslund, director of theStockholm Institute of Soviet and East European Economics,estimates East European and Soviet output declined 8% lastyear, which in Western terms would be a severe recession. Mr.Aslund says the declines varied from about 10% or 11% inPoland, Romania and Bulgaria, to 3% to 4% declines inCzechoslovakia and Hungary.   Western Europeans, too, are now worrying about anotherthreat: massive emigration of Soviets and other EastEuropeans to Western Europe. Demographers say up to 600,000people left the Soviet Union last year, and continuing unrestcould multiply that figure. &quot;Western Europe, historically anet exporter of people, has now become a magnet,&quot; saysFrancois Heisbourg, director of London's InternationalInstitute for Strategic Studies.   More and more Europeans, East and West, argue thatdevelopment in the East is a Continentwide concern. Says anadviser to the president of Bulgaria, &quot;Europe has one bigeconomic problem: If Eastern Europe's rebuilding can't befinanced, Western Europe won't be able to solve its long-termproblem of finding new markets, either.&quot;   (See related story: &quot;A `Cool Peace' Breaks Out As SovietsShift Policy To Pursue Own Interests&quot; -- WSJ Feb. 22, 1991)</TEXT></DOC>
