You also acknowledge that about $18 billion of that is for mass transit. But then you say that the president &quot;proposed to spend $70 billion on highways, not $88 billion.&quot;    True, but a bit misleading. The president proposed spending about $78 billion over the next five years for highways and transit in his fiscal 1988 budget. Hence his claim that our bill was a &quot;budget-buster&quot; to the tune of $10 billion -- $10 billion more than his budget, not the congressional budget resolution.    Then along with his veto message, the president sent Congress a highway/transit bill that, according to a White House issue brief of March 30, would spend a total of $82.1 billion for highways and mass transit over the five-year period, fiscal 1987-91. So the difference between the president and Congress is closer to $6 billion ($88 billion minus $82 billion) than the $18 billion difference you suggest in the conclusion of your editorial.
