Ever since Saddam Hussein lit a fuse under the Middle Easttinderbox on Aug. 2, the oil market has been shoving stocksaround. Mainly down, as was the case again Friday: The DowJones Industrial Average sank 18.56 points to 2564.11, whilethe October crude oil futures contract rose 69 cents to$31.76 a barrel.</LP><TEXT>   Since the invasion of Kuwait six weeks ago, the industrialaverage has moved counter to oil prices on 22 of 30 tradingdays. Of those moves, the industrial average fell -- and oilrose -- more than half the time, or 14 days. On the days whenthe predominant pattern didn't hold, changes in both theindustrial average and oil prices were mostly small.   In a sense, oil simply has become the latest obsession ofstock investors, who love to seize upon an economic indicatoror some other windsock to point the direction they should runin. Over the past year, the stock market has on occasion beendominated for days and even weeks by bond yields, the monthlyemployment report and inflation indexes, among other things.   &quot;Wall Street tries to make things very simple,&quot; says AlGoldman, director of market analysis at A.G. Edwards. &quot;It's aone-note street. But if one makes the mistake of followingthat one note, you miss many critical factors. Admittedly, aswith oil, the myopic view often works -- but only on a veryshort-term basis.&quot;   But to credit the market monomaniacs with certain goodjudgment, oil prices dovetail closely with the major issueson investors' minds: inflation, economic growth or recession,and corporate profits.   &quot;Inflation is the single most negative variable forfinancial instruments,&quot; says A.C. Moore, research director atArgus Research, &quot;and the price of oil is the single mostimportant element. It affects pricing for everything.Secondly, oil-price increases translate into diminisheddemand throughout the economy. There's lots of justificationfor being fixated on oil. It's not a phantom worry.&quot;   Trouble is, when the obsession of the month is expressedin a price, such as oil, the stock market tends to be yankedaround by those investors who are most sensitive to price --namely, speculators. The impact of rising oil prices is feltfirst in that part of the stock market that is most like acommodity-stock-index futures.   With buy and sell programs, jumps in energy prices aretelegraphed to the New York Stock Exchange through theChicago futures markets. &quot;Nobody is going to pull or make abid based on the price of oil; but it is affecting the{futures} market, which causes programs&quot; in stocks, saysMichael LaBranche IV, managing partner at a Big Boardspecialist company, LaBranche andamp; Co.   Some advisers suggest investors try to take advantage ofthe volatility. &quot;When good companies get sold with the bad,an investor can use that as a chance to buy or add to aposition,&quot; says Mr. Moore of Argus. He likes energy stocksand shares of growth companies with large interests overseas,such as the 48% of revenue and profit that Minnesota Mining andamp;Manufacturing gets from foreign operations.   Joseph J. McAlinden, director of equity research at DillonRead, also recommends playing the market's daily ups anddowns in pursuit of a longer-term strategy. He thinksinflation is going to reaccelerate significantly, partlybecause of oil prices but also because he predicts a muchlooser monetary policy in the months ahead.   This scenario is bad for the bond market and a mixed bagfor the stock market, he says. Companies that do well ininflationary periods will see their stocks rise, and viceversa. &quot;Overall,&quot; he asserts, &quot;the stock market will getpulled higher over the next three to six months,&quot; led byenergy, basic industries such as metals and stocks ofcompanies that benefit from increased capital spending.   Specifically, Mr. McAlinden likes Oryx Energy, a Dallascompany with significant oil interests in the North Atlantic,and Burlington Resources, a natural-gas play.Capital-spending stocks he favors: CBI Industries, an OakBrook, Ill., company that builds pressurized tanks for gasand oil, and Motorola, which is big in semiconductors andcellular telephones. Among natural-resource concerns, herecommends Amax, a metals producer.   If you believe in these plays, he says, buy them on dayswhen inflation fears subside; and sit on your hands on dayswhen oil prices -- and inflation fears -- rise.   Ellen Harris, chief domestic investment officer ofPaineWebber mutual funds, suggests investors look at stockswhose ability to earn fatter profits aren't vulnerable to oilshocks. A favorite is Waste Management, and biotechnologystocks such as Chiron and Genetics Institute. &quot;Their growthisn't affected by the events going on&quot; in the Middle East,she says.   Fred Moran, president of Moran Asset Management, thinksinvestors should insulate themselves against recession in theU.S. as well as against the oil shock. He is avoidingcyclical groups such as airlines, autos and retailers andbuying stocks of companies that generate sales no matter howslow the economy, such as cellular telephone and cabletelevision concerns.   &quot;When there was a recession in Dallas and Houston,cellular prospered as well there as anywhere in the country,&quot;he says. &quot;Telecommunications grows even in a recession, or ifoil prices are high.&quot; Among his favorites are McCaw Cellular,Associated Communications and Jones Intercable.   ---   Friday's Market Activity                                                                                                          Evidence of growing tensions in the Persian Gulf andsluggishness in the U.S. economy weighed down the stockmarket and prices closed broadly lower.

The Sandamp;P 500 and the DowJones Equity Market Index each dropped 2%, while the BigBoard's composite index fell 1.9%.   Prices headed lower from the opening bell as the marketresponded to the report on August producer prices, which rosesharply as expected, and other data on the economy'sperformance last month that proved mildly disappointing.
