Republican vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle, meanwhile,said he has not discussed the drug issue with Bush although the GOPnominee has said that his vice president would oversee federal drugpolicy in a possible Bush administration.   The Indiana senator, in an interview with the Boston Globepublished in today's editions, also said he was familiar ``in ageneral sense'' with the National Narcotics Border InterdictionSystem but did not know who headed the system.   Bush has led the system since its creation in 1983.   The Democratic vice presidential nominee, Texas Sen. LloydBentsen, continued to cast doubts on Quayle's experience.   ``Frankly, he would not have been on my short list as I lookover my Senate colleagues,'' Bentsen said Sunday when asked aboutQuayle on NBC's ``Meet The Press.'' ``He obviously was on the shortlist of the hard right. ...   ``Now, I wouldn't say that he couldn't grow into the job; heprobably could. But if a tragedy befell a president, you'd have tobe able to move in immediately and take over and do what has to bedone in facing whatever issues that confront you at that time.''   Democratic nominee Dukakis kicked off a two-day visit to thewestern section of his home state, Massachusetts, where he soughtto halt the recent surge of his Republican opponent.   ``It's going to be a long, hard competitive race,'' Dukakis tolda breakfast sponsored by the Northern Berkshire Chamber ofCommerce. ``One thing that inspires me every day and every week outthere on the campaign trail ... is that I know we can do ittogether because I've seen it happen.''   Bush's chief of staff, Craig Fuller, said the vice presidentwill continue to stress his pro-military views in the coming weekand portray Dukakis as weak on defense. The GOP nominee's campaignbelieves that theme is going over well.   Bush was traveling today from Houston to St. Louis, where heplanned a tour of an aerospace plant, and then to Nashville for arally and visit to the Reserve Officer Training program at MiddleTennessee State University.   He returns to Washington tonight for a series of day campaigntrips to various states and may head west to California andColorado on the weekend.   The vice presidential candidates planned some time off from thecampaign trail but used weekend appearances to criticize theiropponents.   Bentsen, in suggesting that Quayle could not step right up topresidency, was continuing a line of attack that was clear lastweek: show that the 41-year-old Indiana senator lacked the depthand experience for the job that is only a heartbeat away for anyvice president.   Quayle declined to criticize his 67-year-old colleague in theSenate, saying that his gripe is with Democratic presidentialnominee Michael Dukakis. In last week's seven-state campaign,Quayle's only mention of Bentsen was to praise his views on defensespending and other issues where he stands to the right of Dukakis.   ``I've served with Sen. Bentsen for almost eight years. He isnot the issue,'' Quayle said Sunday in an interview with TheAssociated Press. ``The issue is Michael Dukakis. Michael Dukakis'view of America is a much different view than George Bush's.Michael Dukakis' approach to national defense, his approach to theeconomy, his approach to child care _ all of those approaches aremuch different than George Bush's.''   Quayle said doubts about his qualifications are nothing that agood debate wouldn't cure.   ``The American people are just beginning to see Dan Quayle,'' hesaid. ``I'm going to continue to talk about the issues. When wehave the debate between Lloyd Bentsen and Dan Quayle, the Americanpeople will have a lot better picture of who will be the bestqualified vice presidential candidate.''   Quayle traveled to the Midwest and West last week, and willleave again Wednesday for a swing through the Southeast that willtake him through to Labor Day.   Former presidential candidate Jesse Jackson, interviewed onABC's ``This Week With David Brinkley,'' said meanwhile that theDukakis campaign can become too preoccupied with trying win backconservative Democrats who have been voting for Ronald Reagan.   ``I thould think the Democrats' strength is not between the45-yard lines with this obsession to recall the Reagan Democratswho are with Quayle under the Bush,'' he said.   He said that more could be accomplished by massive registrationof new voters, and reaching out to the working and non-working poor.</TEXT></DOC>
