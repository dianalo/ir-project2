But he added that &quot;there is no indication the amount is significant enough to hurt the institution.&quot; The thrift has assets of approximately $1.6 billion. It reported a net loss of $10.9 million for the year ended March 31.    Mr. Portnoy said the thrift fired Jason Chapnick, the company's executive vice president and treasurer after it discovered he had apparently opened an account without authorization and engaged in unauthorized trading, mostly in government securities. The alleged trading appears to have gone on for more than one year, Mr. Portnoy said. &quot;He was trying to generate profits for the association but it didn't work out that well,&quot; he said.    David Bogenschutz, an attorney for Mr. Chapnick, said neither he nor his client would comment on Commonwealth's accusations until &quot;we have reviewed the actions taken by Commonwealth to see whether Mr. Chapnick has any basis for legal action as to the way he has been treated in this case.&quot;    Commonwealth said that in light of Mr. Chapnick's possible involvement in the alleged irregularities, his brother, Barry E. Chapnick, who is chairman and chief executive officer has taken a voluntary leave of absence to &quot;avoid any appearance that the investigation will not be completely impartial.&quot;    Until the investigation is completed, Mr. Portnoy has become acting chief executive officer.    Commonwealth said it has delayed the completion of its year-end audit until the matter is resolved. The thrift said it hired Peat Marwick Main andamp; Co. to conduct a special audit and expects to see some results within 10 days.    The thrift said it has also notified the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the state comptroller's office, the U.S. attorney's office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation about the alleged irregularities. </TEXT></DOC>
