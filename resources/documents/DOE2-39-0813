<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-39-0813 </DOCNO><TEXT>A simulation model is utilized to predict the performance of a high temperaturewater-to-water heat pump, running on Refrigerant 11, over a range ofevaporator and condenser water temperature (10 to 40/sup 0/C and 40 to70/sup 0/C) and compressor speeds (500 to 3000 r.p.m.) It is shown thatheat pump power output can be effectively controlled by varying compressorspeed. Effects of compressor speed, heat source and heat sink (end-use)temperature on the heat pump efficiency are presented. Special attentionis devoted to the values of predicted refrigerant temperature at thecompressor discharge. These are compared with the thermal limit of therefrigerant. Modifications to the system, to reduce refrigerant maximumtemperature, are also discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
