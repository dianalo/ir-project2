 The corporation is aninnovative leader in the telecommunications industry.andM;Developing PINSSandM;SaskTel has undertaken a project to implement an operational support systemfor its local service and the Trans Canada Fibre Optics network, one of themeans of providing long distance service.andM;The system is called Provincial Integrated Network Support System (PINSS) andwill be installed in 1991.andM;PINSS will monitor the equipment, both hardware and software, used to provideservice to SaskTel customers and make sure it is operating in an error-freemanner.andM;PINSS wil continuously examine the entire communications network to detectfaulty equipment, and propose solutions.andM;For example, a PINSS terminal will be able to alert an operator to anequipment failure at a specific location.andP;  The operator will then be able toswitch the area to back-up service and co-ordinate the repair of the primaryequipment.andP;  With the capability to control an intelligent network,interruptions in customer services will be minimized.andM;&quot;The idea of the PINSS is to help SaskTel provide the best telecommunicationservices possible,&quot; says Andrew Purvis, engineer, network system at SaskTel.andM;&quot;With the alarm system, we will be able to detect degraded networkperformance caused by failing equipment and correct the situation before thecustomer is affected.andP;  If equipment failures do occur, they will be fixedfaster.&quot;andM;SimulationandM;The PINSS project is an extensive undertaking, and SaskTel desires toimplement it in the most efficient manner possible and make sure it will meetthe performance requirements.andP;  For example, system response time needs to bewithin specific time limits, and system capacity needs to handle the rate ofalarms.andM;SaskTel is using simulation technology to evaluate proposed operationssupport system designs and determine the equipment and software requirements-- before making a capital investment.andM;Simulation is the process of building a computer-based model of an operationand exercising the model to determine how the system will perform undervarious conditions.andM;A proven techniqueandM;A model is a representation of a system that can be used as an explanatorydevice, an analysis tool or a design assessor.andP;  By exercising the model, theperformance of a system can be estimated.andP;  Decision-making is supported andimproved through this technology.andM;Simulation is a technique that has proven itself as a way of reducing thecosts and risks of operations in a variety of industries: communications,manufacturing, aerospace, electronics, and transportation.andM;The benefits of simulations include: ensuring system objectives will be met;avoiding costly mistakes in the design of operations; and improving resourceutilization.andM;SaskTelhs simulation project is a part of the Telecom Canada project todevelop the PINSS.andP;  The objectives of the simulation were to validate thesystem architecture proposed by the prime contractor, DATAP Systems based inBurnaby, B.C.andP;  and to aid in sizing the computer hardware.andM;DATAP then contracted Pritsker Corp. of Indianapolis to develop the model.andO;Pritsker was chosen because of its full line of simulation software systems.andM;Experiments possibleandM;A team approach has been used to design and implement the model, and SaskTeland other member companies modify and run the model.andM;Using SLAM II with TESS, Pritsker designed a model that enables SaskTel toexperiment with hardware, software, stafing configurations, and othercomponents of the PINSS.andM;SLAM II is a modeling language and TESS is a graphical simulation projectsupport system.andM;Together, they provide total simulation project support from model buildingto results comparison.andP;  SaskTel can modify data and run the model until themost effective PINSS has been established.andM;Purvis explains the benefits of simulating the PINSS: &quot;SaskTel will realizesignificant economic savings from implementing the right PINSS system thefirst time.&quot;andM;If the system were to be over-designed, half - million dollars will have beenspent unnecessarily.andP;  If the system were to be under-designed, we'll have togo back and upgrade it, which would be another cost to our customers.andP;  &quot;Wecan also ensure that the system we choose will provide a good base for futuregrowth,&quot; he says.andP;  &quot;By getting the system right the first time, we are makingbetter use of our resources, and that is passed on to the customers.&quot;andM;Futures usesandM;SaskTel will be the first to field trial a PINSS, and eventually the systemwill be deployed across the country.andP;  The PINSS simulation model will have along life.andM;In the future it will be revised to reflect the evolution of the system, andwill be used by the telecommunications centres of each province to size andplan for the growth of their PINSS.andM;Karen Hopkins is from Pritsker Corp. based in Indianapolis.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
