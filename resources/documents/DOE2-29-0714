In the USA, this has been encouraged by taxincentives and from the decreasing cost of turbine technology. In Canada,one concept being examined is the hybrid diesel-wind generating system.The economics of wind energy are addressed briefly; an example of a 720MWh project with long term financing is given which shows an energy costof 7.9 cents/kWh which is competitive with diesel-produced electricityin many areas. However, it is recommended that the true costs of competingenergy forms be determined before seeing whether wind power is economicallyadvantageous or not. Future business opportunities in wind power arereviewed; studies indicate a potential $5 billion wind turbine generatormarket in the USA and a worldwide potential for wind power in remotecommunities of over 7000 MW.</TEXT></DOC>
