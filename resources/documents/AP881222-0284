The 15 Texas Sandamp;Ls will be acquired by CFSB Corp. Inc., a holdingcompany headed by James M. Fail of Phoenix Ariz., who agreed to putup $120 million to acquire the insolvent institutions.   The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., which guaranteesdeposits at 3,000 Sandamp;Ls, will provide assistance amounting to $1.85billion.   The transaction was part of the Southwest Plan launched last Mayto clean up the problems of 109 failed Sandamp;Ls in Texas, a state wherefinancial institutions have been hard-hit by depressed conditions inreal estate and oil.   The latest rescue package brings the total of failed institutionswhich have been closed or merged to 69 in Texas and to 175 aroundthe country.   ``We now have consolidated more than half of the 109 Texasthrifts that were insolvent when we started the Southwest Plan andwe are rapidly moving toward our goal of completing the work inTexas by the end of the 1989 fiscal year (next Sept. 30),'' said M.Danny Wall, chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, whichoversees the FSLIC fund.   The institutions Fail acquired will reopen Friday as ConsolidatedFederal Bank FSB. Consolidated will initially operate all 59 of thebranches of the former institutions, the bank board said.   Fail is chairman of Lifeshares Service Co. and several otherinsurance companies which operate in 47 states.   The Sandamp;Ls involved in Thursday's action include Commodore SavingsAssociation, Dallas; Mesquite Savings and Loan Association,Mesquite; Mineral Wells Savings and Loan Association, Mineral Wells;Sentry Savings, Slaton; Interwest Savings Association, Fort Worth;Metroplex Federal Savings Association, Hurst; North Park SavingsAssociation, Richardson; and Southern Federal Banc SLA, Lancaster.   Other Sandamp;Ls involved are First Western Savings and LoanAssociation, Colorado City; First Federal Savings and LoanAssociation of Big Spring, Big Spring; Hi-Plains Savings and LoanAssociation, Hereford; Reliance Savings Association, Houston; VistaSavings Association, Odessa; Home Savings, Lufkin; and LamesaFederal Savings and Loan Association, Lamesa.   The bank board's contribution in the latest group of mergersbrings to more than $24 billion the amount the agency has pledged toresolve the cases of 175 failed Sandamp;Ls this year, up from 48 last year.   Wall says he wants to do 200 by the end of the year. The board isrushing to complete transactions because tax breaks for institutionsgetting government assistance will be reduced after Jan. 1.   More than 400 insolvent thrifts remain open and hundreds more areclose to insolvency. Estimates of the cost of cleaning up theindustry range from $50 billion, the bank board's figure, to $112billion, the estimate of the General Accounting Office, the auditingarm of Congress.   The problem is getting worse by more than $1 billion a month.Industry losses in the first nine months totaled $9.4 billion,already surpassing the post-Depression record of $7.8 billion set in1987.   Private analysts, members of Congress and the GAO have criticizedthe bank board for resolving most of the cases through assistance toprivate merger partners. The rescues rely heavily on promissorynotes which pledge income the Federal Savings and Loan InsuranceCorp. expects to receive over the next decade.   Critics say most of the deals fail to attract enough money frominstitutions and investors taking over the failed thrifts. The GAO,in a report earlier this month, said it may be cheaper in the longrun to give the FSLIC the money to close the institutions and payoff depositors.   Congress is planning to begin considering a taxpayer bailout ofFSLIC when it convenes in January.</TEXT></DOC>
