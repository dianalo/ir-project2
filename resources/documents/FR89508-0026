In General</ITAG>1. The price cap plan we propose for regulating local exchange carriers(LECs) builds upon our proposal set out in a Further Notice of ProposedRulemaking release May 23, 1988 (<T3>Further Notice</T3>). The plan is designated to replicate better thantraditional rate of return regulation the incentives to efficiency thatcharacterize a competitive market. The essential premise underlying theproposal is that by limiting the rates carriers may charge, rather thantheir rates of return, price caps will drive carriers to avoid unnecessarycosts, invest in efficiency enhancing technology, and employ innovativeservice approach in order to earn the greatest levels of return withinthe applicable rate limitations. At the same time, the plan guaranteesthat rate-payers obtrain their share of expected productivity gains first,with carriers retaining any additional profits they may generate. Thus,the plan promises that both ratepayers and carriers will be better offthan under rate of return regulation.2. We find that the plan we have adopted for ATandamp;T provide a sound foundationon which to erect our price cap plan for the LECs. However, we propse tocraft that methodology into a plan for the LECs that accommodates the characteristicsof the LECs' services and the market in which they are offered. These proposedmodifications are designed to ensure that implementation of price cap regulationfor the LECs furthers the goal of the Communications Act and, in particular,results in just and reasonable rates for their interstate basic services.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Application of Incentive Regulation to LECs</ITAG>A. Competition3. We tentatively conclude that there is little competition for LEC accessservice, but that the limited nature of competition for LEC services doesnot make a price cap system unworkable or undesirable. While competitionserves as a ``backstop'' in the event price caps for ATandamp;T have unintendedconsequences, we tentatively conclude that alternative mechanisms, suchas an ``automatic stabilizer'' adjustment, or early review, can serve sucha purpose with respect to the LECs.B. Service Quality4. We tentatively conclude that price cap regulation will not adverselyaffect the quality of the LECs' interstate services. First, the LECs' primarycustomers for interstate access are interexchange carriers that can functioneffectively as large, sophisticated, expert surrogates for small individualusers. Second, because revenue for interstate access is largely usage sensitive,LECs have significant incentives to prevent declines in service qualitythat might lead to call blockage. Third, the facilities used to provideinterstate access are the same facilities LECs use to provide intrastateservices. Since many states have specific service quality standards andmonitoring programs complementing our programs, it is unlikely that a LECcould degrade service quality without detection.5. We therefore tentatively conclude that there is no need for the Commissionto adopt specific service quality standards. However, to allay the concernsexpressed by state commissions and users, and to provide ourselves withdata to assist our evaluation of price caps, we propose to monitor thequality of service provided by LECs subject to price cap regulation. Wepropose a service quality monitoring program that requires LECs to submitreports that include information on the installation interval (percentof time service installations are completed within the interval quotedto customer), the repair interval (total number of hours necessary to completea customer's request for repairs), the network blockage percentage, andthe number of formal FCC complaints per 1,000 access lines. We seek commenton whether we should require additional reporting categories, includingpost-dial delay, transmission quality, and switch downtime.C. Jurisdictional Allocations6. We tentatively conclude that price cap regulation will not adverselyaffect intrastate rates, services, or jurisdictional allocations. The possibilityof cost shifting between jurisdictions is inherent in a bifurcated regulatorysystem. However, we tentatively conclude that the combination of separationsrules, the Commission's automated reporting requirements (ARMIS), and statemonitoring will be effective in identifying and correcting the misallocationof costs to either the state or the interstate jurisdiction. We proposeno changes to existing separations rules.D. Eligibility for the LEC Price Cap Plan7. We propose LEC price cap eligibility requirements in the form of twogeneral rules and one limitation on those rules. First, we propose thatprice caps be mandatory for all Tier 1 LECs that withdraw from the carriercommon line (CCL) pool administered by the National Exchange Carrier Association(NECA), and for all affiliates of such carriers. Second, we propose thatother non-pooling LECs may elect price caps, on an all-or-nothing basis,if none of their affiliated carriers remains in either the CCL or trafficsensitive (TS) pools. Finally, in defining the scope of both mandatoryand elective price caps, we propose to exempt average schedule companiesfrom the ``all-or-nothing'' rule so that such carriers may continue tobe reimbursed for their costs on the basis of average schedules after theiraffiliates convert to price cap regulation.8. We believe price cap regulation will increase carriers' incentives toachieve heightened efficiency, which in turn should lead to lower servicerates. Our proposal excludes pooling carriers from price caps, becausepooling, by its nature, entails risk-sharing and a concomitant diminutionof incentives to operate efficiently. The pool, however, serves anotherimportant policy_universal service_which we value more highly than efficiency.E. Timing of Implementation9. We propose that price caps for LECs be implemented with the filing ofannual access tariffs, to be effective July 1, 1990, on 90 days' notice.Unlike the <T3>Further Notice</T3>, we propose that the CCL charge be subject to pricecaps from the outset. Carriers that have not already made the electionto withdraw from the TS and/or CCL pools may establish eligibility forprice caps by notifying NECA on or before December 31, 1989, of their intentionto withdraw from those pools effective July 1, 1990.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. The Mechanics of the Proposed LEC Price Cap Plan</ITAG>A. In General10. We propose that LECs subject to price cap regulation file inauguralprice cap tariffs March 30, 1990, to be effective July 1, 1990, and thereafterto file annual price cap tariffs effective July 1, on not less than 90days' notice. We propose that price cap filings must be accompanied byprice cap indexes (PCIs) (which reflect changes in costs associated withthe provision of service groupings, or baskets), actual price indexes (APIs)(which reflect changes in aggregate rate levels for baskets), and serviceband indexes (SBIs) (which reflect changes in rates for service categorieswithin baskets). We propose that as long as the carrier's proposed ratelevel changes are within applicable cap and band limitations, the tarifffilings will be presumed lawful, and except for the 90-day annual filing,may take effect in 14 days. B. LEC Services Subject to Price Cap Regulation 11. We tentatively conclude that although capping all existing LEC serviceswould yield the greatest benefits as a general, theoretical matter, someservices are structured and priced in such a way that applying a pricecap structure to them would be excessively difficult. Therefore, we tentativelyconclude that special construction and individual case basis services shouldbe excluded from price cap regulation. In addition, we tentatively decidethat these services should be subject to conventional tariff review. 12. We tentatively decide that LEC services should be placed in three baskets:(1) A common line basket; (2) a traffic sensitive switched basket; and(3) a basket containing all other capped services. Each basket would besubject to a separate cap in the form of that basket's PCI. The API isthe value of aggregate rates in a basket. Under the proposed plan, a basket'sAPI must never exceed its PCI, absent an extraordinary showing. Furthermore,we propose that within baskets, services would be assigned to service categories,the prices of which would be subject to annual restrictions on upward anddownward movements, as measured by SBIs. 13. We tentatively decide that a separate common line basket would easeadministration of price cap regulation, and aid NECA in calculating a theoreticalnationwide average CCL rate to be used in determining Long Term Supportfor LECs remaining in the NECA common line pool. Therefore, we tentativelydecide that common line should be in a separate basket. Because this basketcontains only the common line element, we tentatively conclude that separatebanding restrictions within the common line basket are unnecessary. 14. Our proposal to separate traffic sensitive switched and special accessinto two baskets appears to us to provide LECs with sufficient flexibilityto develop service innovations and achieve efficiencies, while ensuringthat ratepayers are protected. The TS switched basket we propose wouldcontain traffic sensitive switched services, with upper and lower bandsof 5 percent on the established Part 69 elements: local switching, transport,and information. We tentatively propose that those carriers that employthe optional equal access element place that element in the TS switchedbasket. We also seek comment on whether banding limitations should applyto any Basic Service Element subelements that may be required under ourOpen Network Architecture policies or other subelements, such as 800 database access or the equal access element, that LECs are required or permittedto offer on an unbundled basis. 15. The final basket, consisting of all other capped services, will bedominated by special access services, but will also contain corridor interstateservices. We tentatively conclude that 5 percent upper and lower bandsat the service category level are suitable for that basket. Service categorieswould track existing special access services, <T3>e.g., </T3>(1) metallic; (2) telegraph; (3) program audio; (4) voicegrade; (5) video; (6) wideband audio; (7) wideband data; (8) digital data;and (9) high capacity. We tentatively conclude that new services, or servicesnot on this list, should be classified at the same level of generality.While we tentatively propose to place GTOC's International Message TelephoneService (IMTS) from Hawaii in this third basket, we seek comment on whetherthat service should be placed in a separate basket. C. The Price Cap Index 16. The proposed price cap index, or PCI, is an index of change in thecost of factors of production, including inflation, LEC productivity, andcertain carrier-specific cost factors that are beyond the carrier's control.The PCI for each basket of services acts as a ceiling above which thatbasket's index of actual prices_the API_cannot go without an extraordinaryshowing. We propose that cost changes due to the inflation and productivitycomponents of the PCI formula be reflected in annual index adjustments.We propose that the inflation component be represented by the Gross NationalProduct Price Index (GNP-PI), a broad-based index of price changes in allsectors of the economy, published by the Department of Commerce. We tentativelyconclude that LECs should be permitted to use the 45-day estimate of theGNP-PI, in order to provide them time to incorporate this data into theirannual filings. We propose a 2.5 percent annual productivity factor, plusa 0.5 percent consumer productivity dividend (CPD) to ensure that ratepayersbenefit from productivity gains in excess of historical levels. 17. Price cap levels will also vary with changes in certain ``exogenous''costs, that is, costs that are beyond the control of the carrier, and affectthe telecommunications sector, rather than the economy as a whole. We proposeto treat as exogenous the following: changes in access charges for LECinterstate interexchange services; changes in interstate costs caused bychanges in the Separations Manual and the Uniform System of Accounts (USOA);changes in costs due to the completion of the amortization of depreciationreserve deficiencies; and changes in costs caused by reallocation of investmentfrom regulated to nonregulated activities pursuant to Section 64.901 ofthis Commission's Rules. We also propose to treat changes in pooling supportobligations as exogenous costs, and solicit comment on this tentative conclusion.We seek additional information on the nature, extent, origin, and scopeof ATandamp;T Point of Presence migration. We tentatively conclude that LECswhich have not begun equal access conversion at the time they become subjectto price cap regulation may request permission to treat equal access conversioncosts as exogenous when they do begin the conversion process. Finally,we propose that LECs may request exogenous treatment of changes in costsdue to tax law changes, or other cost changes that are beyond a carrier'scontrol, and that affect its costs disproportionately relative to the economyas a whole. 18. We tentatively conclude that the LECs should be required to file adjustmentsto their PCIs each year in connection with the annual price cap tarifffiling. In addition, we propose that LECs update their PCIs to accountfor mid-year exogenous cost changes. Except for the common line basket,for which we propose a modified formula, the PCI formula we propose forthe LECs is:<ITAG tagnum="26">PCI<T2>t</T2>=PCI<T2>t^1</T2>[1+w(GNP-PI^X)+DY/R+DZ/R]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">where </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">GNP-PI=the percentage change in the GNP-PI, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">X=productivity factor of 3.0%, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">DY=(new access rate ^ access rate at the time the PCI was updatedto PCI<T2>t^1</T2>) andmultiply; base period demand,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">DZ=the dollar effect of current regulatory changes, when comparedto the regulations in effect at the time the PCI was updated to PCI<T2>t^1</T2>, measured at base period level of operations, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">R=base period quantities for each rate element ``i'', multiplied bythe price for each rate element ``i'' at the time the PCI was updated toPCI<T2>t^1</T2>, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">w=R_(access rates in effect at the time the PCI was updated to PCI<T2>t^1</T2> andmultiply; base period demand) + DZ, all divided by R, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">PCI<T2>t</T2>=the new PCI value, and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">PCI<T2>t^1</T2>=the immediately preceding PCI value.</ITAG>19. We propose to calculate exogenous adjustments by comparing a carrier'shistorical cost experience with the costs it would have experienced duringthe same period if the input cost levels and regulatory environment anticipatedin the upcoming year had been in effect during the base period. To aidus in our analysis, we plan to build a computerized database to verifythe accuracy of certain exogenous changes. In addition, we propose to continueour practice of establishing tariff review plans that specify the typeand format of data that must accompany annual tariff filings. 20. The productivity factor in the PCI is designed to adjust for the factthat, historically, carrier productivity has exceeded that of the economyas a whole. We tentatively conclude that long term evidence in the recordconcerning productivity is the best evidence of historical productivity,and that the best estimate of future LEC productivity is 2.5 percent. Wetentatively conclude that attempts to corroborate the 2.5 percent figureby analyzing changes in LEC rates during the 1984-88 period, although well-foundedin principle, do not appear capable of being used to calculate a precisemeasure of LEC productivity during this period because of complicationsresulting from the number of exogenous cost adjustments that must be madeand the lack of quality data. Although the productivity studies based onpost-divestiture data provide some corroborative evidence, the record todate leaves open the possibility that some LECs may experience sustainedlevels of productivity gain above or below the 2.5 percent industry average.21. To remedy our concerns about individual carrier productivity, we tentativelypropose two modifications of the generic price cap formula. The first modificationwe propose is an additional profitability constraint: the ``automatic stabilizer.''The second modification addresses the method of recovering common linecosts. 22. Although we believe that 2.5 percent per year represents a reasonableestimate of potential LEC industry productivity, we recognize that theexperience of individual LECs may show some statistical variability aroundthe mean performance of all LECs especially over relatively short periodsof time. We therefore believe it may be appropriate to include in the pricecap formula for all three LEC baskets an automatic adjustment factor, orto adopt some other approach, in order to reflect the possibility of well-above-averageor well-below-average productivity performance by individual LECs. Thepurpose of such an adjustment factor would be to keep prices in a zoneof reasonableness relative to costs while maintaining incentives for LECsto lower costs and develop new and better services. 23. We propose that within a range between two points below and two pointsabove the target rate of return, carriers keep, for tariff review purposes,all the gains from above-average performance and bear all the risks ofbelow-average performance during the initial four years of the plan. Wealso tentatively conclude that consumers should share in the benefits ofabove-average performance outside this range and, in return, should bearsome of the risk of below-average performance outside this range. Accordingly,we propose to adjust each LEC's price cap index based on deviations ofthe rate of return actually realized by each LEC from the range describedabove. We propose to make such an adjustment at the time of the annualrevision of LEC access tariffs. As an alternative to this automatic stabilizerapproach, we propose to conduct a review of price caps for LECs in late1991. 24. We seek comment on our proposal to establish an automatic stabilizer,our alternative proposal of shortening the review period, and our tentativeconclusion that inclusion of one of these alternatives would lead to justthe reasonable rates.25. Common line costs are by nature non-traffic sensitive, that is, theydo not vary at all in relation to a change in demand (<T3>i.e., </T3>a change in minutes of use per line). A portion of the commonline revenue requirement is recovered by LECs directly from end users.LECs recover the residual portion of the common line revenue requirementfrom interexchange carriers, through the carrier common line charge. TheCCL charge is particularly sensitive to the level of demand because itis determined by dividing a LEC's total minutes of demand for switchedaccess services into a revenue requirement that does not fluctuate directlyin accordance with demand. We recognize that the unique properties of commonline might have an effect on calculations of LEC productivity. 26. Our objective is to establish a cap for the common line basket thatis consistent with both the productivity factor we have derived from longterm Bell System studies and with our policy that rates be adjusted torelect exogenous demand stimulation. Neither the per line nor the per minuteapproach properly relates the special characteristic of common line_<T3>i.e., </T3>the insensitivity of common line costs to changes in demand_tothe historical productivity studies. Therefore, we propose a combinationof the two measures in an attempt to adapt the historical measures to theprediction of common line productivity, consistent with our policy concerningexogenous demand stimulation. The common line PCI formula we propose is:<ITAG tagnum="26">PCI<T2>t</T2>=PCI<T2>t-1</T2>[1+w[(GNP-PI-X)+(g/2)(GNP-  PI-X-1)]/(1+g)+<T2>D</T2>Z/R] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">where </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">GNP-PI=the percentage change in the GNP-PI, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">X=productivity factor of 3.0%, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">g=the ratio of minutes of use per access line during the base period,to minutes of use per access line during the previous base period, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26"><T2>D</T2>Z=the dollar effect of current regulatory changes, when comparedto the regulations in effect at the time the PCI was updated to PCI<T2>t-1</T2>, measured at base period level of operations, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">R=base period quantities for each rate element ``i'' multiplied bythe price for each rate element ``i'' at the time the PCI was updated toPCI<T2>t-1</T2>, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">w=R+<T2>D</T2>Z, all divided by R, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">PCI<T2>t</T2>=the new PCI value, and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">PCI<T2>t-1</T2>=the immediately preceding PCI value. </ITAG>27. We seek comment on our tentative decision to resolve uncertainty concerningpotential LEC productivity arising from the relationship between demandgrowth and common line NTS costs through the application of this adjustmentto the PCI formula applied to the commoin line basket. We also seek commenton our tentative conclusion that application of this adjustment makes itunnecessary to make the separate adjustment for exogenous demand stimultationdescribed in the <T3>Further Notice</T3>. D. Comparing LEC Rates to the PCI and Banding Limitations 28. The proposed actual price index, or API, measures the incremental changein the aggregate price of each basket of services each time a LEC proposesrate revisions. We propose an API formula which requires the summationof the weighted ratios of proposed prices and existing prices, as follows:<ITAG tagnum="26">API<T2>t</T2>=API<T2>t-1</T2>[S<T2>i</T2> v<T2>i</T2> (p<T2>t</T2>/p<T2>t-1</T2>)i] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">where </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">API<T2>t</T2>=the proposed API value, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">AP<T2>It-1</T2>=the existing API value, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">p<T2>t</T2>=the proposed price for rate element ``i,'' </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">p<T2>t-1</T2>=the existing price for rate element ``i,'' and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">v<T2>i</T2>=the current estimated revenue weight for rate element ``i,''calculated as the ratio of the base period demand for the rate element``i'' priced at the existing rate, to the base period demand for the entirebasket of services priced at existing rates. </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">We propose that new LEC services be incorporated into the proper APIsat the first annual price cap filing following completion of the base periodin which they are introduced, using weights established during the baseperiod. We also propose that LECs immediately adjust their APIs to reflectservice restructuring or abandonment, using estimation techniques to assigncustomers of the abandoned or restructured services to those remainingor becoming available following the change. 29. We tentatively conclude that LECs subject to price cap regulation mustestablish subindexes within their TS switched and ``all other'' basketsto measure the revenue-weighted aggregate prices of the groups of rateelements that comprise the banded service categories. We propose that eachsuch service band index, or SBI, should be calculated according to thefollowing formula: <ITAG tagnum="26">SBI<T2>t</T2>=SBI<T2>t-1</T2>[S<T2>i</T2>v<T2>i</T2>(p<T2>t</T2>/p<T2>t-1</T2>)<T2>i</T2>] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">where </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">SBI<T2>t</T2>=the proposed SBI value, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">SBI<T2>t-1</T2>=the existing SBI value, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">p<T2>t</T2>=the proposed price for rate element ``i,'' </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">p<T2>t-1</T2>=the existing price for rate element ``i,'' and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">v<T2>i</T2>=the current estimate revenue weight for rate element ``i,''calculated as the ratio of base period demand for rate element ``i'' pricedat the existing rate, to the base period demand for the entire group ofrate elements comprising the service category priced at existing rates.</ITAG>We propose that in order to receive streamlined filing and review treatmentfor a tariff revision, the value of each affected SBI may not increaseor decrease annually by more than 5 percent, relative to the change inthe PCI. E. Establishing Initial Index Values 30. We tentatively decide that reliance upon existing rates, developedunder established rate of return procedures, is the most reasonable optionfor initally determining compliance with a price cap system for the LECs.We do not believe a comprehensive rate case prior to initiating a LEC pricecap plan would serve the public interest. In addition, however, we seekfurther comment, legal analysis, and data on issues associated with imposingan across-the-board cut in LEC rates to account for embedded inefficienciesat the outset of price cap regulation. On the current record, we tentativelyconclude that the consumer productivity dividend we have proposed is bettertargeted to reflect anticipated productivity gains than an initial ratecut would be. 31. We recognize that the present earnings of certain LECs require adjustmentprior to implementation of price caps. The Common Carrier Bureau is movingto reduce the earnings of such LECs to authorized levels, and we wouldexpect that carrier rates at the time price caps are implemented wouldbe carefully targeted to achieve the authorized rate of return. However,since overearnings by LECs are not uniform, or consistent across servicecategories, we tentatively find that the record on carrier earnings doesnot support a uniform across-the-board cut. In addition, while we planto move expeditiously to conclude existing investigations of LEC rates,we tentatively conclude that resolution of all such investigations is nota prerequisite to the implementation of price caps, since we can make anynecessary adjustments resulting from such investigations after price capregulation has been established.32. We propose that in connection with the initial LEC price cap filingseffective July 1, 1990, LECs shall use calendar year 1989 data to establishinitial base period weights and that they set initial index values at 100,corresponding to the rates and costs in effect on December 31, 1989. Wepropose that any changes in rates or exogenous costs between that dateand July 1, 1990, should be reflected in adjustments to the APIs and PCIsat the time of the inaugural filing.F. Evaluation of Price Cap Rates<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Annual Filings</ITAG>33. We propose that the first annual price cap tariff filing, in whichLECs calculate price cap indexes and actual price indexes for each of theservice baskets covered by the plan under standard price cap procedures,should be effective on July 1, 1990. The LECs would make their annual filingson March 30, 1990, with an effective date of July 1.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Within-Band Rate Level Changes</ITAG>34. We propose that rate level changes that produce an actual price indexless than or equal to the price cap index, and rates within the applicableprice bands qualify for streamlined treatment. Tariffs proposing such ratelevel changes would be filed on 14 days' notice, and would be presumedlawful. In lieu of traditional cost support, streamlined filings need besupported only by the calculations necessary to demonstrate that the proposedrates are within the limits set by the PCI and the price bands. We tentativelyconclude that petitioners seeking suspension of a streamlined filing mustdemonstrate: (1) A high probability that the tariff would be found unlawfulafter investigation; (2) that suspension would not substantially harm otherinterested parties; (3) that irreparable injury would result if suspensiondid not issue; and (4) that suspension would not otherwise be contraryto the public interest.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Above-Band Rates </ITAG>35. We tentatively conclude that above-band rates raise questions aboutthe distribution of rate increase burdens that require the fullest possibleconsideration by interested parties and by this Commission. Therefore wetentatively require that above-band rates be filed on 90 days' notice,with a likelihood of suspension. The justness and reasonableness of above-bandrates will be assessed in light of the overall price caps scheme, and LECswill be required to make a ``substantial cause'' showing, which will usuallyinvolve a detailed and specific cost justification of the proposed increase.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Above-Cap Rates</ITAG>36. We tentatively conclude that tariffs proposing above-cap rates willbe filed on 90 days' notice, will generally be suspended, and must be accompaniedby cost support data demonstrating that the rates are just and reasonable.In their cost showings, LECs would be required to assign costs to rateelements, or to the lowest possible level, and to explain the allocationof costs within each basket, and among baskets. We seek comment on whether,if we adopt the automatic stabilizer mechanism, we should require thatLEC filings proposing above cap rates satisfy an even more stringent standard.We also seek comment on whether there should be circumstances in whichthe burden to be met by small telephone companies should be different fromthat imposed on large companies.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Below-Band Rate Level Changes</ITAG>37. We propose that tariff filings proposing below-band rates be made on45 days' notice and be accompanied by a showing that the rates cover thecost of service and are otherwise just and reasonable. For the purposeof initial review of such filings, we propose to employ the average variablecost standard as a benchmark for determining whether a proposed rate decreaseshould be investigated and/or suspended.<ITAG tagnum="81">6. New and Restructured Services</ITAG>38. We tentatively conclude that new and restructured services must receivespecial tariff review treatment because they present a potental means ofavoiding pricing restrictions. A touchstone for distinguishing betweennew and restructured services is the continued availability of a previously-tariffedalternative that characterizes new services. That is, new services addto the range of options available to customers, while restructured servicessimply represent rearrangements of existing services. we tentatively concudethat tariffs proposing new services should be filed on 45 days' noticewith data that demonstrate compliance with modified version of the netrevenue test. Under this test, a new service, and each unbundled elementthereof, must be projected to increase the carrier's net revenues for servicessubject to price cap regulation within the lesser of 24 months from theincorporation of the service into an annual price cap tiling, or 36 monthsfrom the effective date of the service. We tentatively conclude that thedata submitted in satisfaction of the net revenue test will be sufficientto allow this Commission and interested partes to determine whether proposedrates for a new service are outside the zone of reasonableness.39. We propose to require that when a LEC submits a tariff filing thatwould restructure an existing capped service, it be required to show compliancewith the price cap limits of the basket, and where applicable, the bandinglimits of the service category to which the service to be restructuredbelongs. In addition, the filing would be made on 45 days' notice and subjectto conventional tariff review to ensure that the restructuring did notproduce unreasonable discrimination among service users or did not haveany other anticompetitive effects. Finally, we tentatively find that pricecap carriers should continue to adhere to the rate structure requirementsof Part 69.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Small Company Issues</ITAG>A. Continuation of Programs Promoting Universal Service 40. We believe that price cap regulation should not disturb our longstandingpractice of employing a unitary rate of return for the local exchange industry,thereby ensuring that access rate determinations for those remaining underrate of return and the support mechanisms associated with access chargerevenue requirements are unaffected by the implementation of a price capsystem. We tentatively decide to exempt price cap carriers from interstateearnings limitations imposed as part of the rate of return process. However,we propose to require that price cap carriers employ the existing rateof return in calculating their obligations under the various universalservice programs we have adopted whenever a rate of return is necessaryas part of the calculation. We also proposed amendments to Part 65 thatwould specify the last rate of return reporting period for carriers switchingto price cap regulation, as well as amendments that would govern refundobligations for price cap carriers that stem from a pre-price cap period.41. With respect to Part 69, we tentatively conclude that any amendmentsthat we make to our access charge rules to accommodate price cap regulationmust not interfere with the support mechanisms of the depooling process.The calculation for Long Term Support payments from those exiting the NECAcommon line pool to those carriers remaining in the pool requires a commonline revenue requirement for the industry. We tentatively find that itis therefore necessary to allocate access investment and expense betweencommon line and other interstate services.B. Geographic Rate Averaging 42. This Commission has repeatedly demonstrated its dedication to geographicrate averaging of toll calls on the public switched network through ourvarious decisions affecting recovery of common line costs. We have doneso because we believe that geographic rate averaging is an important policythat contributes to the achievement and maintenance of universal service,as well as to the simplicity and clarity of ATandamp;T's long distance rates.We believe that the proposals set forth herein for the LECs will not createthe kind of LEC pricing flexibility that commenters argue would force ATandamp;Tto deaverage its rates. We tentatively conclude that the common line costrecovery methods we have previously enacted, together with the price capsystem we are proposing, will not lead to the kind of disparities in CCLcharges that would prompt interexchange carriers to deaverage their rates.The price cap plan we have adopted for ATandamp;T already provides for a90-day notice period, a five-month suspension, and an investigation inconnection with any future proposals to deaverage rates. We do not believethat further action, such as a prohibition on deaveraging, is warrantedat this time.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Other Issues</ITAG>A. Monitoring and Performance Review 43. During the initial years of price cap regulation we propose to monitorthe LECs' performance, with particular attention to prices, earnings, qualityof service, and technological progressiveness. ARMIS reports will includeinformation on revenues, expenses, investment, taxes, and earnings, aswell as demand data, and will permit this Commission to monitor a varietyof LEC activities, including cost allocations between regulated and nonregulatedactivities and allocations between the state and interstate jurisdictions.In addition to monitoring price cap regulation through the collection ofdata, our review of tariffs, and the complaint process, we propose to reviewLECs' performance in a comprehensive manner after an initial period ofexperience with price cap regulation. The performance review will considerall available measures of market and carrier performance, including, butnot limited to, actual prices, achieved rate of return, quality of serviceand technological progressiveness. Decisions about certain aspects of thetiming and nature of the comprehensive review must await the resolutionof outstanding issues relating to uncertainties associated with LEC productivity.Parties commenting on the nature of the performance review for the LECsshould do so in the context of this Commission's proposals to address productivityissues.B. Effect of Incentive Regulation on Existing Commission Policies 44. We tentatively conclude that there are no theoretical or practicalbarriers to implementing both price cap regulation and our Open NetworkArchitecture (ONA) policies. We contemplate that federally tariffed BasicService Elements and Basic Servicing Arrangements will be available toall users, and that these services will consist of unbundled access elementsthat will be purchased by enhanced service providers as well as by otherusers of exchange access. We tentatively conclude that such ONA servicesdo not differ from other interstate basic services offered by the BOCsin any way that is relevant for purposes of this proceeding. Accordingly,we do not propose to require further special treatment for ONA servicesas part of price cap regulation. 45. We tentatively conclude that the implementation of price cap regulationfor the LECs will be enhanced by the continuation of existing rules, theUSOA, the separations manual, and the joint cost rules. In addition, wepropose to retain existing complaint procedures. Finally, we tentativelydecide that we should continue to enforce the Part 63 rules concerningextension of lines and discontinuance of service under price cap regulation.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Paperwork Reduction Analysis</ITAG>46. On June 14, 1988, after the release of the <T3>Further Notice</T3> in this proceeding, this Commission requested thatthe Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review the proposed informationcollection requirements for compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Actof 1980. On August 15, 1988, OMB commented on this Commission's proposedinformation collection requirements. OMB stated that the <T3>Further Notice</T3> failed to demonstrate the practical utility ofsome of the reporting requirements proposed in the Commission's request,and found that the information collections are not the minimum necessaryto meet the objectives of the proposed rules. In commenting on this Commission'srequest, OMB listed a series of concerns that it asked this Commissionto address. Those concerns have been addressed in the context of this Commission'sFinal Order adopting and implementing price cap regulation for ATandamp;T,and in the context of this Commission's Second Further Notice of ProposedRulemaking proposing to implement price cap regulation for the LECs. 47. Although this Order adopts incentive regulation for the LECs, we arenot at this time promulgating final rules to implement incentive regulationfor the LECs. This Order does, however, propose a set of regulations forimplementing incentive regulation for the LECs. In connection with thisSecond Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking with respect to the LECs,we renew our request for review of Paperwork Reduction Act requirementsin light of the proposals made in this Further Notice. The proposed rulesfor LECs contained herein have been analyzed with respect to the PaperworkReduction Act of 1980, and found to decrease the information collectionburden on the public. This proposed reduction in the information collectionburden is subject to approval by OMB as prescribed by the Paperwork ReductionAct.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis</ITAG>48. We certify that the Regulatory Flexibility Act is not appicable tothe rule changes we are proposing for the LECs in this proceeding. In accordancewith the provisions of section 605 of that Act, a copy of this certificationhas been sent to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration.49. As part of our analysis of the proposal described in this Further Notice,however, this Commission has considered the impact of the proposal on smalltelephone companies, <T3>i.e.,</T3> those serving 50,000 or fewer access lines. As a resultof our decision to make price cap regulation elective for depooled costcompanies below the Tier 1 level, no small carrier will be forced to changethe method by which it is regulated. Small companies that currently filetheir own cost-based access tariffs are free to remain under rate of returnif they decide that rate of return is better suited to their circumstancesthan is price caps. Small carriers participating in the NECA pools, andfor whom NECA files access tariffs, will not be forced to leave the poolsas a result of the price cap rules we are proposing in this Notice. Inaddition, nothing in the price cap proposal would discontinue or impairthe variety of programs we have established to provide support to smallcarriers. These programs, such as our High Cost Fund and long term supportmechanisms, continue intact. Furthermore, average schedule companies thatare or become affiliated with cost companies that are regulated under pricecaps would not need to relinquish average schedule, rate of return regulation.We have also proposed that, for companies that have not yet begun conversionto equal access, conversion costs be treated as exogenous costs under theprice cap formula. This proposal ensures that small carriers, who are theleast likely to have begun equal access conversion, can flow through thesecosts to their rates should they elect price caps. These proposals, whenviewed in their totality, permit small, depooled cost companies to takeadvantage of the benefits of price cap regulation at their option, whileensuring that the status quo is maintained for small carriers that do notparticipate in price cap regulation.<ITAG tagnum="84">VIII.
