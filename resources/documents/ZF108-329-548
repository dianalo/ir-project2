Fugere, vice president of information services at Bethlehem SteelCorp. in Bethlehem, Pa., estimates that his 1990 IS budget ratio of fixed tovariable costs is 75:25%.andP;  The process-manufacturing industries havetraditionally typified the yearly averages in DATAMATION's cycle of three.andM;The variable aspect of the steel maker's IS budget depends entirely on howmuch systems development work the department must do in any particular year.andO;Because demand from clients will be heavy in 1990, Fugere's budget will rise5% to 6% to cover associated IS labor costs and increased use of outsidesoftware companies.andM;Demand for IS Workers Is on the RiseandM;Respondents to this year's DATAMATION survey expect their departments to growrobustly, and they emphasize the increased importance of informationtechnology (and by association, IS professionals) to their organizations.andP;  Solike Fugere, their budgets will grow an average 5.9% in 1990 and, unlikethose in last year's survey, they are hungry for IS workers.andP;  The size of thestaff reporting directly to the average IS department (including contractstaff from outside software companies) will increase by over 13% to 32 ISworkers in 1990, the survey reveals.andM;A factor in the variable portion of the budget is software pricing.andO;Although, for example, IBM's hardware pricing has been predictable, itssoftware hikes have been erratic.andP;  Fugere says his department has often beenunprepared for software price hikes.andP;  &quot;We've been caught many times.&quot;andP;  saysFugere.andP;  The best you can do, he says, is discover whatever rhythm or patternexists in IBM's software pricing and leave some slack in the budget for theyears you think you'll get hit.andP;  Advice from one of IBM's biggest commercialcustomers, Aetna Life andamp; Casualty Co. of Hartford, Conn., is more pointed.andO;&quot;Find ways to turn your IBM reps into employees of your company, not of BigBlue,&quot; says Irwin Sitkin, who recently retired as Aetna's vice president ofcorporate administration.andP;  &quot;Get them to ferret out the data you need forbudget planning.&quot;andM;Outside contractors will always remain a variable.andP;  &quot;When clients demand morethan you can deliver, you use them to get out of a bind,&quot; says Fugere.andP;  &quot;Whenbust years come you cut them back.&quot;andM;But there are other outside variables that aren't so easy to control.andO;Inflation, interest rates, the changing economics of technology and theincreasing economic interdependtence of nations across the world.andP;  Despitethe existence of new stabilizing influences on IS budgets, such variablescould break the cycle of three anytime during the rest of the decade.andO;Sudden, unforeseen changes in, let's say, the Japanese banking or stocktrading system could trigger a recession in the United States.andM;Perhaps the biggest variable is the impact on IS spending created by a changein thinking about how information technology should be deployed inorganizations.andP;  By and large, users in the previous decade allocated ISresources in piece-meal fashion.andP;  They dealt with problems one application ata time in a sequential manner.andP;  In the new decade, users will attempt toautomate whole clusters of applications simultaneously as they build theirnetworks.andM;&quot;To do so they must lock into long-term IT investments that may or may notresult in big paybacks five years or more down the road,&quot; says Rod F. Monger,an analyst at the Research Board in New York City.andP;  Since the nation'saccounting system doesn't encourage such long-term investment, here we haveanother unknown.andP;  Some corporate leaders and gurus from the accountingprofession are already calling for reform of the U.S.andP;  accounting system.andO;One idea is to do away with quarterly reporting and start with the yearlypicture.andM;It's well known that the Japanese and other nations have used long-terminvestment to gain market share.andP;  Many corporate chiefs aren't prepared towait for such changes and believe that privatization of their companies isthe best answer.andP;  Privately owned companies aren't answerable to public stockholders or the ruthless logic of the quarterly balance sheet and can lockinto long-term IS investments.andM;&quot;Privatization is a growing trend,&quot; says Monger, who predicts that such atrend could bring about more long-term investment in information technologyand have a major positive impact on IS budgets.andP;  Should there be asubstantial overhaul in the U.S.andP;  accounting system, and in the currentstructure of corporate ownership, IS budgets will be transformed.andP;  Thethinking being that if U.S.andP;  companies have incentives to invest in thefuture, they will commit greater resouces to information technology in thepresent.andM;Of more immediate concern to the cross section of CEOs, financial officersand top IS executives polled in this year's budget survey is another wildcard: inflation.andP;  Coupled with rising interest rates, inflation couldundermine IS budgets in 1990.andP;  The executives also say downsizing, a higherU.S.andP;  dollar and a diminishing pool of highly skilled IS personnel could curbbudget growth.andM;As natural as it is to fear the unknown, it is possible that IS budgets inthe 1990s could be buffered from such outside variables by an idea that hascaught on in the 1980s: the service level agreement.andM;The 1970s and early 1980s brought wild swings in IS budgets, and spendingcould sometimes soar as much as 20% a year or more.andP;  &quot;Five or six years ago,we were in double-digit growth,&quot; says DuPont vice president of informationsystems Raymond E. Cairns of his company's past IS spending habits.andO;Increases in IS outlays these days at the Wilmington, Del., chemicals giantbarely match the growth of inflation as Cairns' department competes withother functions within DuPont for limited amounts of financial resources.andM;The reason IS budgets flew as fast as they once did and grounded to a nearhalt just recently has much to do with the customers of most ISdepartments--the functional areas of businesses that make them tick.andP;  &quot;Thebusiness units didn't tell us exactly what they wanted, and they keptchanging their requirements,&quot; Bethlehem Steel's Fugere replies when asked toaccount for those double-digit IS budget growth days of yore.andP;  &quot;When costsescalated, IS became the fall guy,&quot; he says in explaining why budget growthtrailed off.andM;With the advent of service level agreements, that has all changed.andP;  Today, itis the business unit that must justify its portion of the IS budget, describeprecisely what it wants done and be accountable for the money spent.andP;  The ISdepartment signs a contract, a service level agreement, when it feels it canfulfill these requirements over the year ahead.andP;  The clients also sign thecontract and become equally accountable for the work.andM;In many companies, top IS executives and their budgets are now also protectedfrom changes in the inflation rate.andP;  As they prepare their budgets, they aregiven a formula from the financial department that they must use to computepersonnel and employment costs.andP;  This formula is preadjusted to take intoaccount any variation in the inflation rate expected that year.andM;Using service level agreements and inflation-buffering formulas, informationsystems and its clients can break up long-term IT investments into executablechunks.andP;  Emerging technologies, notably computer-aided software engineering(CASE), help by providing better measures of productivity and management ofthe ongoing software development process.andM;Future PredictionsandM;Only modest swings in IS budgets will occur in the 1990s, even with all thewild cards and uncertainties that characterize the outside environment,Fugere and other IS executives predict.andP;  A retreating economy, for example,won't even bring out everybody's budget axe.andP;  Some 52% of the IS andfinancial executives polled in this year's survey say that a recession in1990 would have no impact on their budgets.andP;  Nearly two out of threeexecutives, in fact, believe there will be no recession in 1990.andO;Particularly adamant about this are the retail trade, insurance and processindustry sectors.andM;Such antirecessionary feelings of course go hand-in-hand with a positiveattitude toward revenue growth.andP;  Most U.S.andP;  executives think their businesseswill grow heartily in 1990--expressing little or no fear that Pacific Rim orEuropean rivals will best them.andP;  Moreover, it's apparent that they arecounting on information technology to fuel such growth.andP;  Little else  couldexplain why most users are planning significant increases in IS staffing--ata time when most other areas of corporations and agencies are under the chillof hiring freezes.andM;The IS Work Force Is ExpandingandM;Respondents, typically from companies with 1990 revenues above $1 billion,are projecting a 13% increase in the number of staff reporting directly tothe IS department.andP;  Demand is strongest in the manufacturing/industrialsector (a 19.2% increase) and least pronounced in the public sector (0.6%increase).andP;  But in none of the 27 industry categories on the survey was adecline in workers reporting to the IS department forecast.andM;Also growing strongly is &quot;The New IS Force,&quot; a phrase coined in DATAMATION'sAugust, 1, 1989 cover story (p.andP;  18) on those full-time IS professionals whogenerally reside in business units.andP;  These dispersed workers constitutealmost 34% of all IS professionals in the user organizations surveyed, andtheir numbers will grow 8.5% to an average 21.3 workers per company thisyear.andP;  Some organizations, of course, are employing this new force to greaterdegrees.andP;  At DuPont and MCI Communications Corp., for example, IS chiefs saythat 75% of their organizations' IS work forces call business units--notheadquarters--home.andM;In the minds of managers at large and small user organizations, theimportance of information technology to their enterprises and the growthexpected of the enterprises themselves are fueling demand for more ISworkers.andP;  Curiously, another reason is corporate streamlining--particularlyat companies with fewer than a thousand employees of all types.andP;  Almost sixout of ten managers see streamlining as having a beneficial effect on their1990 Is budgets--reinforcing the notion that information technology and itsmasters (IS workers) are enabling companies to trim away unnecessary fat.andM;Streamlining has an organizational connotation; it implies squeezing outinefficient layers of managers and workers.andP;  It shouldn't be confused withdownsizing, which refers to switching from large computer systems to smallones.andP;  In fact, 61% of executives polled by DATAMATION regard downsizing asdetrimental to budget growth.andM;Other reasons cited for the increase in the IS rank and file are the mergerof voice and data operations (bringing communications employees under IS'umbrella), and the recentralization of the data center function within theorganization.andM;Although the management over data center functions is returning to corporateheadquarters at many user organizations, the processing power of IS continuesto become more widely distributed throughout corporate domains, particularlyat the PC level.andP;  It's clear from the survey that along with distributedcomputing has come distributed responsibility for information technology.andO;This is perfectly natural when you consider that information technologytypically consumes at least 30% of a company's capital spending budget.andM;Non-IS InfluenceandM;It's hardly surprising, then, that almost a third of all IS investments byuser organizations surveyed by DATAMATION are made without any involvementfrom central Is influences.andP;  In addition, there are an increasing numbernon-IS employees with buying or specifying authority over informationtechnology: an average 5.4 persons per company, an increase of 14% over lastyear.andM;Change is also evident in the way organizations are deploying these ISresources.andP;  In last year's survey, 49% of IS investments supportedback-office applications.andP;  This year, it has declined to 38%, asmission-critical applications in manufacturing, distribution andsales/marketing have grown to consume the bulk of IS dollars.andM;Such front-office applications are built on desktop systems--but notnecessarily on the single-user personal computers of yesterday.andP;  For thesecond year in a row, PCs are commanding a smaller--albeit stilldominant--portion of technology investments than before.andP;  In 1990, PCs willcapture only 34.6% of the budget for new hardware, software andcommunications products--down from 39.6% in 1989.andM;Instead, what's likely to support these new applications are small multiusersystems that can range from networked high-performance workstations andservers to the low end of midrange systems.andP;  Spending on multiuser systems,which usually run on second-generation PC operating systems like OS/2 or onUNIX, is expected to consume 11.4% of user resources for new technologies--abig jump from the 8% they devoured last year.andP;  These systems also may besmall midrange systems, such as the low ends of IBM's AS/400 line and DigitalEquipment Corp.'s VAX 6000 family, that serve the needs of a half dozenusers, come bundled with database and operating systems and feature cannedindustry-specific software.andP;  Servers, such as Compaq Computer Corp.'sSystemPro, members of Sun Microsystems Inc.'s SPARC line and IBM's newRS/6000 family, also promise to capture multiuser dollars.andM;The public sector remains the biggest supporter of stand-alone PCs.andP;  Bigorders for laptops and other systems will boost government spending on PCs bysome 20% between 1989 and 1990, according to the survey.andP;  But smallcompanies, especially those with up to 250 employees, are reducing theirdependence on stand-alone PCs.andP;  And so are a growing number of industrysectors--particularly wholesale trade, food service, nondurable goodsmanufacturing and the process industries.andM;Minispending on MinisandM;The traditional minicomputer is also under siege.andP;  Medium and high-endmidrange machines, those priced between $100,000 and $1 million, will attractmerely 7.2% of the dollars that users spend on new hardware, software andcommunications.andP;  That's down from 7.4% a year ago.andP;  Not a big percentage asyet, but comfirmation of the trend noted in the Cowen andamp; Company/DATAMATION'sMini/Micro spending survey (See &quot;The Desktop Dimension,&quot; DATAMATION,November.andP;  1, 1989, p. 28), which revealed that the dollar value ofminicomputer shipments would fall 10.5% between July 1989 and June 1990.andO;That's the first such decline in the 16-year history of the survey.andM;Turning against the mini are banks, insurance companies, retailers, healthcare providers, educational institutions and, especially,process-manufacturers.andP;  Process industry spending on midrange systems will bedown 37% this year.andP;  &quot;It's hard to conceptually justify a midrange[systems],&quot; explains Norbert J. Connors, comptroller of computer servicescenters for the USS Steel Division of USX Corp. in Pittsburgh.andP;  His companyhas junked all its minis and moved to a two-tier hardware architecture oflarge central hosts systems linked to dispersed multiuser systems.andM;But the mani has plenty of defenders, otably in the wholesale trade sector,which is throwing out stand-alone PCs and adding midrange systems.andP;  Anotherstalwart user of minis is the nondurable goods manufacturing industry.andO;Companies in the 100 to 250 employees range will be the biggest buyers ofminis in 1990, the survey reveals.andM;Big Iron Is a Big TargetandM;Another hardware institution, the venerable mainframe system, is also underfire.andP;  IBM is coming to the end of a long eight-year mainframe cycle, and itshows in our survey.andP;  Large-scale systems spending will be off 20% as suchMIPS monsters slip to represent merely .8% of all technology investments byusers.andP;  This statistic may be a function of the survey sample, which drawsfrom a cross section of companies--small, medium and large--in the UnitedStates.andP;  Many may not have large-scale systems installed in theirorganizations or at least not have widespread purchasing authority for them.andO;Indeed, the DATAMATION 100 survey of the world's top information technologysuppliers shows large-scale systems to be alive and well--accounting for12.5% of worldwide industry revenues in 1988.andM;Mainframe spending has also been hit by industry consolidation.andP;  Untoldnumbers of data centers have been shut down in recent years, only to bereplaced by fewer mergasized complexes.andP;  &quot;There's too much fat in the DPbudget,&quot; says Mike Zucchini, chief information officer at the Fleet NavistarFinancial Group in Providence, R.I.andP;  &quot;And most of it is in the form ofdispersed mainframe-based data centers.&quot;andM;The mainframe sniping in the United States may be a temporary phenomenon,some experts believe.andP;  The first of IBM's large systems family for the 1990s,&quot;Summit,&quot; should ship late next year.andP;  Customers are expected to open theircoffers for Summit to be able to mount new databases and business criticalapplications such as imaging and computer-integrated manufacturing.andM;The survey shows a healthy appetite remains for large system memory, disk andtape storage after consolidation.andP;  For example, the percentage of the ISbudgets in 1990 allocated for disk/tape subsystems at companies with morethan 1,000 employees is expected to grow 42%--even with far fewer newmainframes around.andM;On Software andamp; OutsourcingandM;Although each hardware category has its champions and its detractors, thesurvey population agrees that software rightfully occupies center stage.andO;Demand for systems software is up, while investments in applications softwareare down.andP;  What explains such behavior in a decade when users say they aredevoted to applying information technology to every corner of theirenterprise?andP;  Perhaps users are investing in new systems software, notablyproducts such as OS/2 and UNIX, in anticipation of new applications theyintend to build with future IS budgets.andM;Supporting this line of thinking is the outlook for spending on databasesoftware.andP;  Since so many applications are built on databases, many people putdatabase software in the same category as systems software.andP;  Nearly 3% of allIS investments in new technologies will go toward database software.andO;Measured as a portion of the average user organization's total outlays forsoftware of all types, database products consume nearly 16% of such spending.andM;The budget survey always throws light on some controversial subjects, andthis year is no exception.andP;  Outsourcing, the farming out of IS work tosoftware companies and other vendors, is a continuing trend.andP;  Although somefear it will eventually undermine the whole IS profession, our survey doesn'tsupport such a view.andP;  IS spending on outside services only amounts to 7.9% ofthe total.andP;  There is some cause for concern, however, at largeorganizations--those with 1,000 or more employees--where it's a differentstory.andP;  At such companies, the percentage of outsourced money is growing muchfaster--18% from 1989 to 1990.andM;The survey also reveals that CASE, imaging and RISC technologies are takingoff.andP;  Especially notable is the increased investment in optical storageproducts.andP;  Although only 6% of survey respondents currently use thistechnology, nearly 37% plan to do so by the end of the year.andM;Such a willingness to spend on emerging technologies always has characterizedthe budget habits of IS users.andP;  If 1991 holds true to form, new products andservices and all the other boats in the IS ocean will benefit from arising--perhaps cresting--tide next year.andP;  This year's survey centainlysuggests that smart user organizations are bringing the right IS hands ondeck to see that such investments speed them on their competitive courses.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
