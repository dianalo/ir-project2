Murphy Co. variety store operations to E-II Holdings Inc., a unit of Riklis Family Corp., for $77.6 million.    The discount retailer said the final selling price is subject to post-audit adjustment. The company said the sale isn't expected to have a material impact on its earnings.    Ames said it will use the net after-tax proceeds of about $55 million to reduce long-term bank debt incurred when it bought the Zayre stores division last year. </TEXT></DOC>
