 As a consequence, we have a dual system offederal and state protections for marks, either of which applies dependingupon whether the goods or services with which a mark is associated arelegally considered to be part of interstate commerce.andM;Ironically, this switch in the Constitutional underpinning of federalprotection of trademarks has also resulted in marks being grantedtheoretically perpetual existence, a benefit their owners would not enjoy hadmarks continued to be treated as though they were patents.andP;  Remember, inproviding for copyrights and patents, the Constitution authorizes thegranting of an &quot;exclusive Right&quot; to authors and investors for only &quot;limitedTimes&quot;.andP;  However, there's no such restriction on Congressional authorityunder the Commerce Clause.andM;This is not to say that trademarks can't be lost.andP;  A mark becomes abandonedwhen it is no longer being used.andP;  In order to clear out this sort ofdeadwood, the 1946 Lanham Act requires that trademark registrations berenewed periodically by the filing of an affidavit showing that a mark isstill in use.andP;  And as we saw last month, the Trademark Law Revision Act thatwent into effect in November 1989 provides a maximum three-year period withinwhich a reserved mark must be placed in actual use or be lost.andM;What gives the proprietors of marks the most sleepless nights, however, isnot the minor nuisance of complying with the &quot;use&quot; requirement, but thespecter that a valuable mark might be ruled to have become generic, and henceto be in the public domain.andP;  The list of once-haughty marks that havesuffered this fate is extensive, including the likes of aspirin, cellophane,linoleum, nylon, thermos, and, recently, &quot;Murphy bed&quot; and &quot;Toll Housecookies&quot;.andM;To day that a mark is generic merely means that it is no longer associated inthe public's mind with one particular company's product exclusively, but hasbecome a word commonly used to describe a type of article or activity.andP;  Marksthought to be in jeopardy on this ground at one time or another include&quot;Kodak&quot;, &quot;Xerox&quot;, and, perpetually, &quot;Coke&quot;, and the owners of thesetrademarks have made heroic efforts to save them.andP;  (Try publishing an articlethat uses &quot;coke&quot;--without the capital &quot;C&quot;--to refer to one of Coca-Cola'ssoft drinks, or--horrors!--to someone else's product, and see how long ittakes before you receive a letter from one of the company's legal typestelling you that what you have done is very, very naughty, and that you mustnever do it again.)andM;All right, then, if terms that are part of general everyday language can't beprotected trademarks, what, exactly, can?andP;  Unfortunately, the answer to thatsimple question is endlessly complicated, and we could devote the remainderof 1990 to it without scratching the surface.andM;In the broadest terms, a mark may consist of a word, a name, an elementcommonly referred to as a &quot;logo&quot;, or a combination of these.andP;  A keyrequirement of a mark is that it be associated exclusively with a particularproduct or service, and used in commerce for the purpose of distinguishingthe product or service from those of competitors.andM;Do not confuse a trademark with a trade name.andP;  A business will nearly alwayshave a trade name --Suzie Smith Enterprises, for example--but most have notrademark.andP;  In some instances, however, a word may constitute both a mark anda trade name: Apple, Exxon, Xerox.andM;Trade names are not protected under either federal or state trademark laws,but they nevertheless have legal protection.andP;  It's unfair competition if youattempt to cash in on another company's reputation by giving your ownenterprise a deceptively similar moniker, and state laws provide youraggrieved competitor with numerous remedies ranging from injunctions to moneydamages.andP;  This falls under the legal category of &quot;passing off&quot; your goods asthose of another and, even in the absence of a trademark, it's a no-no.andM;I get the distinct impression that &quot;passing off&quot; litigation is on the rise,possibly as a result of the recent trend toward consolidation of what oncewere local or regional business activities along national and internationallines.andP;  Thus, we find accounting firms in Britain and the US doing battleover which has the right to the name &quot;Deloitte&quot;, radio stations from coast tocoast squabbling about the use of the slogans &quot;pirate radio&quot; and &quot;talkradio&quot;, Donald Trump in a tizzy because a firm in Lithia Springs, GA, hasbeen marketing business cards it calls &quot;Trump Cards&quot;, and IBM franticallyattempting to prevent other companies from using the label &quot;Big Blue&quot;.andP;  Thelatter, of course, isn't IBM's official name, but the company does claim toown this trademark on the basis of one of its products, which turns out to bea typewriter ribbon.andP;  Though IBM has apparently given up its attempt toprevent a Long Island computer distributer from using the name Big Blue, it'sstill less than happy about an ex-employee turned winemaker who's begunmarketing a line of Big Blue vintages that includes Compatible White andInterface Blush.andM;Keeping in mind the distinction between trademarks and such businessaccoutrements as trade names, we'll take a look at the legal rules regardingthe former.andP;  As previously mentioned, these are quite complex to begin withand further confusion is engendered because as applied, trademark concepts donot always produce the expected results.andP;  It's not unlike the situation incopyright law where, although there's a basci rule that ideas can't becopyrighted, the fundamental distinction between ideas (not protectable) andtheir expression (protectable) in practice frequently becomes blurred.andO;(Everyone who shouts, &quot;Look and feel!&quot; gets an &quot;A&quot; for this session.)andM;Thus, in theory, words in common use can't constitute trademarks.andP;  But sincethey are more or less immortal, trademarks often survive to be used in alinguistic context quite different from the one in which they were originallycoined.andP;  Surnames used as trademarks exhibit the same longevity; buddingentrepreneurs usually find it disconcerting when they discover tat theirnames have been appropriated years ago as trademarks by others.andM;Words that are merely descriptive of the product won't initially qualify forthe federal Primary Register of trademarks, but may qualify for a lessfavorable type of registration known as the Secondary Register.andP;  (The same istrue for surnames.e  A mark that is &quot;deceptively misdescriptive&quot; won'tqualify for any sort of registration (example: the term &quot;Neohide&quot; fornonleather shoes).andP;  Geographical names are subject to similar distinctions:the product must actually originate from the place named, or the mark will beconsidered &quot;deceptively misdescriptive&quot;, and the name must have acquired whatthe law calls a &quot;secondary meaning&quot; associating it in the public's mind withthe product before it can qualify for the Primary Register.andM;A few other bars to trademark registration exist--such as those preventingthe use of immoral or scandalous material--that we won't concern ourselveswith here.andP;  The most serious obstacle to registration in most instances isthe requirement that the mark not be similar to one already registered, or toany other mark or trade named that's been used in the US previously and hasnot been abandoned.andP;  While the Patent and Trademark Office searches itsdirectories as part of the process of registering a mark, it's wise--and inthe long run, less costly--to have a search made before filing forregistration.andP;  Trademark practitioners and professional search companiesperform this function, and now there are computer databases from which theinformation can be gleaned.andM;But complications can still arise.andP;  It's virtually impossible to rule out thepossibility that somewhere in the US some firm may already be using anunregistered mark or trade name similar to yours.andP;  Remember that rights touse these things arise under state as well as federal laws.andP;  While a propersearch should reveal prior state registration of a mark, in some instances itmay not, and an unregistered mark may be impossible to turn up in advance.andO;Remember further that the rule for trademarks is, &quot;first in time, first inright&quot;.andM;This is a major reason that registration is so important.andP;  In the federalcourts, a mark admitted to the federal Primary Register is prima facieevidence of the validity of the registration and ownership of the mark, andof the exclusive right to use it in interstate commerce.andP;  Moreover, afterfive years on the Primary Register, the mark becomes incontestible.andP;  Moreimportantly, its owner still has no right to use the mark in a locality wheresomeone else has been using a similar mark previously and has not abandonedit.andM;The Secondary Register offers far fewer advantages initially, but it willallow the owner of a mark to sue for infringement in the federal courts.andO;After five years, however, the owner can petition for transfer of the mark tothe Primary Register, if it can be shown that it has acquired the necessarysecondary meaning associating it in the public's mind with a particularproduct or service.andM;In light of all this, it's hardly surprising that more and more trademarksconsist of &quot;coined&quot; words.andP;  &quot;Exxon&quot; is an obvious example, as, of course, is&quot;UNIX&quot;.andP;  Another spur to &quot;coined&quot; trademarks is their growing importance ininternational commerce.andP;  Clearly, it's advantageous to have a name that canbe used all over the world, and usually only a made-up word will permit this.andO;An example of what can happen otherwise is afforded by the recordingindustry.andP;  Ever wonder why the company that used to be called ColumbiaRecords in the US is now called CBS Records?andP;  Well, it seems that thetrademark &quot;Colombia&quot; was owned overseas by competitors.andP;  Ditto for &quot;Victor&quot;and &quot;Decca&quot;.andP;  This also explains why you don't see much of Nipper, theVictor/HMV pooch, anymore.andP;  These venerable marks have either had to beretired or drastically curtailed in use, now that the recording industry hasbecome internationalized.andM;Throughout this discussion there have been references to products orservices.andP;  This has been an attempt not to confuse, but rather to alert thereader to the fact that there is a separate federally recognized category ofmarks called service marks.andP;  These are handled similarly to trademarks, thechief distinction being that service marks are applicable to services ratherthan to tangible goods.andM;The owner of a federally registered mark is entitled to use the symbol [R] or* in conjunction with it.andP;  No one else is permitted to use these symbols.andO;(The initials &quot;TM&quot; and &quot;SM&quot; are often used with terms and logos that areclaimed as marks, but have not yet been registered.andP;  It's felt that theseabbreviations serve to indicate that notice has been given to other partiesthat trade or service mark ownership is being asserted.)andM;Now, as our ship slowly sails away from this visit to the fascinating worldof trade and service marks, we must once again mention state systems for theregistration and protection of these forms of intellectual property.andO;Requirements and formalities for state registration may or may not closelyresemble those under the federal trademark laws.andP;  Whatever they may be, it'sessential that they be followed strictly, whether federal or stateregistration is involved.andP;  In many jurisdictions, for example, it's fatal toattempt to register a mark as a trademark if it's determined to be a servicemark upon examination.andP;  In short, don't try to do this yourself, at least notthe first time.andM;Glenn Groenewold is a California attorney who devotes his time to writing andlecturing on computer law.andP;  He also has served as an administrative lawjudge.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
