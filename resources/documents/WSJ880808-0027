May I clear up misunderstandings on both these points?    Every scientific body that has recently examined the global warming threat has concluded that it deserves to be taken very seriously. Just remember two facts: (1) Without nature's pre-industrial endowment of atmospheric carbon dioxide, the world would be on the average about 33 degrees Celsius cooler than it is today; and (2) this century's combustion of fossil fuels and deforestation have raised the atmosphere's carbon-dioxide concentration by about 25%. There's more to the story, but, clearly, we are changing something very important in a very important way. It is genuinely shortsighted to belittle the threat of global climate change.    Nuclear power is indeed an available non-fossil source of energy, but it probably will not, in the end, provide a major part of the answer to global warming. Its public acceptability is too low and its price is too high. If we try to solve the greenhouse problem by cramming nuclear power down the throats of an unwilling public and unwilling investors, we will be setting the stage for prolonged confrontation and stalemate. And what is going to happen to nuclear power if there are one or two more major accidents like Three Mile Island and Chernobyl?    Moreover, there are safer and cheaper alternatives for the short run, including the vast potential for efficiency gains in how we generate and use electricity. For the longer run, I would favor a modest research effort aimed at &quot;reinventing&quot; nuclear power in a way that could gain public and investor confidence; we may need it one day. My guess, however, is that before such a new nuclear system could be commercialized in the next century, the price of photovoltaic and other advanced renewable energy systems will be competitive.
