The offer came after all-night peace talks with competing bidder Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. fell through for the second time in two weeks.    The management group, together with partners Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and Salomon Inc., proposed to take RJR private in a leveraged buy-out for $84 a share in cash and $8 a share in securities. That would top KKR's bid of $20.6 billion, or $90-a-share, in cash and securities not only in total but in quality, because it provides for a larger cash outlay to holders. The group's offer will be considered by a committee of RJR's outside directors.    But even as bidding heated up, both sides held out hopes of an ultimate settlement. In talks that stretched until nearly daybreak Thursday, representatives of KKR and the management group tentatively agreed on a joint offer for RJR on a fifty-fifty basis.    Under that plan, the company would have been controlled equally by KKR and the RJR-Shearson-Salomon group, with RJR President F. Ross Johnson continuing at the company's helm with considerably more autonomy than executives at other KKR-financed businesses. The talks were described by both sides as cordial and involving fewer of the ego and style clashes that marked previous talks.    In the end, talks on history's largest takeover were snagged by what amounted to a high-level catfight between the two group's investment bankers, participants said. The dispute was over which firms would manage bond offerings to help finance the joint bid. Shearson and Salomon, which would reap huge fees from such offerings, refused to allow a KKR banker, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., to manage them.    Behind the three investment banks' fight was intense competition for big underwriting fees -- in the tens of million of dollars -- and the perception of past slights. Some key officials at Salomon and Shearson consider themselves bitter enemies of Drexel, which has bested them in past bond-selling wars. &quot;Greed was a factor,&quot; said one person familiar with the talks. &quot;But these guys have a long history with each other.&quot;    Neither the Shearson-Salomon pairing nor Drexel would budge from their demands to be lead manager of what would be one of history's largest bond offerings. Faced with intractable advisers, both RJR's Mr. Johnson and KKR stood by their investment banks and were unable to resolve the dispute.    &quot;We came very close to a deal,&quot; said an RJR negotiator. &quot;A concept was established around which to build the meat, but when it came to putting meat on the bones, there was disagreement on where it would fit.&quot; Added an RJR official: &quot;We agreed to agree, but ultimately we couldn't agree.&quot;    Wall Street's reaction to the RJR group's bid was tepid, in part because of the belief among many takeover speculators that the two sides would ultimately cut a deal. &quot;I'd love to lie to you and say this is the start of some big bidding war, but it's not,&quot; said one arbitrager. &quot;These guys are clearly getting together at some point.&quot;    RJR closed at $87 a share, up 25 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday.    A special committee of the RJR board was meeting yesterday afternoon when the RJR group's bid was announced, but it wasn't overly impressed either. The committee, charged with evaluating offers, doesn't believe it yet has a bona fide one before it, according to a legal source familiar with deliberations. That's because neither the Johnson-led group nor KKR has yet paid commitment fees for financing.    Dillon Read andamp; Co. and Lazard Freres andamp; Co., the investment bankers advising the committee, are understood to be analyzing the values of RJR's businesses and the committee's possible alternatives. The committee is believed to be in no hurry to act, because it doesn't want to be accused of having precluded further bids by acting too fast.    Nevertheless, the management group's bid, which was expected, exerts more pressure on KKR to seek an agreement with RJR executives led by Mr. Johnson. The New York-based buy-out firm could top the bid, but aides have said that KKR principal Henry Kravis is reluctant to bid too high without the cooperation of RJR's management, which is considered important to any buy-out's ultimate success.    How high could KKR go? Either bidder could be flexible about what RJR businesses to sell or keep at a price of up to $95 a share, says Richard Bernstein, an analyst at Mercantile Bank andamp; Trust Co., Baltimore. Beyond that, he said, &quot;you could be forced into a position of having to sell (assets) under bad circumstances.&quot;    RJR's Mr. Johnson said the group has received commitments for equity and bridge loans to finance the bid. An RJR spokesman declined to elaborate. But it's understood that a major portion of the group's funding comes from a group of commercial banks led by Citicorp's Citibank and Bankers Trust Co.    &quot;Our offer will be good for the company, its employees and the communities we serve,&quot; Mr. Johnson said in a statement, &quot;because our management group would bring the continuity and know-how needed to ensure the continued long-term success of the business.&quot;    The management group's bid takes the form of a one-step merger rather than a tender offer, such as KKR has launched. Under its plan, the offer must be put to a shareholder vote. That the management group chose a merger offer rather than a tender offer turned off some arbitragers. &quot;A merger offer costs nothing -- your mother can do it,&quot; said one. &quot;A tender offer means you're serious.&quot;    Talks between KKR and the RJR-Shearson-Salomon group began early Wednesday evening and were initiated by KKR, people familiar with the talks said. Though they issued a statement of their continued confidence in Shearson and Salomon, RJR executives agreed to the talks because they believed that KKR possessed what one official called &quot;the financial acumen&quot; to make such a mammoth deal work.    &quot;It became apparent,&quot; an RJR aide said, &quot;that an avenue we would have to explore would be getting together with KKR. With their financial acumen, we just had to talk to them.&quot;    After hours of talks, the two sides agreed to the basic outline of a power-sharing agreement in which RJR's board seats would be split evenly between the two groups. Though KKR has no history of such arrangements, participants said it gave up its demands for outright control in order to play a major role in the deal.    Previously, KKR said that losing such control wouldn't be fair to the buy-out firm's investors, principally big state pension funds and other institutions. But KKR's Mr. Kravis has told Shearson executives his firm is determined to take part in the deal to protect its &quot;franchise&quot; as leader in the buy-out industry.    One measure of how close the two sides came to agreement was the widespread unwillingness among participants to discuss details of why the talks fizzled. But despite a public statement by Mr. Johnson and KKR that the talks had been terminated, hopes remained high among participants on both sides that a deal would soon be struck.    &quot;There is still room for KKR to somehow come back into the fold,&quot; an RJR aide said.    There was no word yesterday on any offer from a possible third bidding group led by Forstmann Little andamp; Co. As reported, the big buy-out firm has cut off talks with the RJR-Shearson-Salomon group and is attempting to assemble its own bidding group. </TEXT></DOC>
