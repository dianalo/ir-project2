Armed men meanwhile entered the grounds of Jose Simeon CanasCentral American University before dawn and killed and mutilatedsix Jesuit priests, their housekeeper and her 15-year-old daughter.   The government denied responsibility for the killings and saidan investigation was under way. In Washington, White Housespokesman Marlin Fitzwater condemned the killings as ``outrageous.''   Reports on fighting in the countryside were sketchy, but atleast 800 people have died and 1,600 have been wounded since theoffensive in all 14 provinces began Saturday night.   President Vinicio Cerezo of Guatemala proposed Thursday that theOrganization of American States send a delegation to El Salvador tonegotiate a cease-fire. He said such a truce should be supervisedby U.N. forces.   Guerrilla leaders have acknowledged they cannot win the10-year-old war militarily but launched the offensive to prove thearmy also could not win and that rightist President AlfredoCristiani would be unable to govern without a role in governmentfor their Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front.   Although only 1,500 guerrillas are thought to be involved in theattack in San Salvador, the entire capital of 1 million peopleseemed besieged. Virtually nothing was open and the sounds ofcombat were everywhere. A-37 attack jets screamed overhead,followed by thundering explosions as bombs dropped.   ``We were caught in the crossfire,'' said Angel Erazo, clutchinga kitten on one hand and a bag of clothes in the other. ``It was ahorrible night.''   Residents of one neighborhood who had been without food for dayslooted a marketplace.   ``We have no food, no money, nowhere to go,'' sobbed AdiliaHernandez, from Zacamil, a northern neighborhood held by theguerrillas since Saturday night.   Amnesty International, the London-based human rights group, said50 civilians took refuge Thursday in a suburban church. The churchwas surrounded by troops and there are three Jesuit priests inside,the rights group said. The report could not immediately beindependently confirmed.   Uniformed security officers late Thursday raided a downtownoffice of the Lutheran Church and arrested 12 foreigners, includingfour U.S. citizens, who work with the church, said Michel Gagne, aconsular officer in the Canadian Embassy.   Gagne said the foreigners, who included a Canadian and a WestGerman minister, were detained by the Treasury Police, but thepolice would not confirm the report.   He identified the Americans arrested as Paula Brentlinger, aphysician, and Thomas Gabriel, a nurse, both from Seattle; BradleyFields, a social worker from San Diego and Paul Fitch, a volunteerwhose hometown was unknown.   Earlier Thursday, a priest quoted two witnesses as sayinguniformed government troops killed the six Roman Catholic priests.The government denied the accusation and said the the crime was``intended to destablize the democratic process and increase evenmore the climate of anguish'' created by the rebel offensive.   The guerrilla offensive was launched three days after theguerrillas canceled peace talks with the government following aOct. 30 terrorist bombing that left 10 dead at a union hall.   The guerrillas called for an uprising to topple Cristiani. TheU.S.-backed government has declared the rebel offensive a failureand insisted the guerrillas do not control any significantterritory.   Thousands of Salvadorans have been forced to flee their housesand many have said they blame the guerrillas for their misery.   The slayings at Central American University were the mostsignificant mass killing since 1980, when seven leftist politiciansand three U.S. nuns and a lay worker were killed by governmentforces.   Those killings helped kick off a cycle of violence that has ledto more than 70,000 deaths, including tens of thousands killed byright-wing death squads.   On Thursday, the rebels appeared to have taken new ground in thenorthern neighborhood of Mejicanos, but fell back in Soyapango onthe eastern side of the city. Fighting also continued in Zacamil,on the north.   Several hundred guerrilla fighters had moved down overnight fromthe heights above Mejicanos, another northern neighborhood. Theywere in control of the main streets Thursday, including a marketthat besieged residents began looting.   In Soyapango, the guerrillas appeared to have backed down afterintense house-to-house combat, but the entire capital seemed underfire. The sounds of combat were everywhere. The government hasimposed a state of siege and a curfew, and the rebels have declareda ban on all traffic.   The guerrillas, estimated to have 7,000 full-time fighters and11,000 backups nationwide, are heavily outnumbered by the56,000-strong Salvadoran army and other security forces.</TEXT></DOC>
