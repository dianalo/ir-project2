They endorseda plan covering medium and large cars to bring the EC intoline with standards applied in the U.S. since the early1980s.   The EC's environment commissioner, Carlo Ripa di Meana,told the ministers he would propose next year more stringentstandards, setting mandatory exhaust limits for 1996 and evenmore ambitious targets for the year 2000.   TURKEY REJECTS IRAQI PLEA                                                                                                          Ankara rebuffed an Iraqi appeal that Turkey reopen a616-mile oil pipeline that was the source of half ofBaghdad's hard currency prior to the Persian Gulf crisis.Officials told visiting Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister TariqAziz the pipeline would remain shut until the United Nationslifted economic sanctions imposed after Iraq's invasion ofKuwait last August.   The twin pipeline from the northern Iraqi city of Kirkukto the Mediterranean can carry 1.6 million barrels of oil aday.                                                                                                          FOREIGN AID FOR INDONESIA                                                                                                          Indonesia has won pledges for a record amount of foreignaid this year, despite an investment boom, an oil-pricewindfall and pressure on donors to help needier nations. TheInter-Governmental Group on Indonesia promised $4.75 billionin aid, up 5.3% from a year earlier. The 18-nation IGGI wascreated in 1967 to lift Indonesia out of then-dire financialstraits. Indonesia is considered a &quot;showcase&quot; for the WorldBank and a crucial business partner for Japan, the largestsingle donor. Much of the aid flows back to donor nationsthrough aid-financed projects carried out by companies fromthe donor countries.                                                                                                          TRADE UNIONISTS AT RISK                                                                                                          More than 200 trade unionists were murdered in LatinAmerica between January 1990 and last March, making it themost dangerous region for union members, the InternationalConfederation of Free Trade Unions said. In the survey of 72countries, the Brussels-based group said 264 unionists werekilled and 2,422 detained or arrested. It cited as dangerspots Colombia, Guatemala, El Salvador, Brazil, Nicaragua,South Africa, the Philippines, China, Sudan, Turkey, IvoryCoast and South Korea.                                                                                                          AS WESTERN AID TRICKLES EAST...                                                                                                          Only a small amount of Western assistance promised by twodozen industrialized nations to the new democracies inEastern Europe has been sent, the European Community said. Asof mid-May, Western nations pledged $31 billion to Poland,Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Bulgaria and Yugoslavia.Last year, disbursements amounted to 11% of about $13.8billion promised by the EC, the U.S., Britain, Norway, Japan,Finland, Australia, Denmark, Canada and Ireland; the lattertwo fulfilled their pledges.                                                                                                          ...KOHL WARNS OF `WEALTH WALL'                                                                                                          German Chancellor Helmut Kohl urged the European Communityand North America to help rebuild and develop Eastern Europeand the Soviet Union. Otherwise, he said, the West risksreplacing the Iron Curtain with a Wealth Wall. &quot;A failure ofthe political and economic reforms in Central, Eastern andSoutheastern Europe would have grave results&quot; world-wide, hesaid.                                                                                                          SOUTH AFRICAN TAX PROPOSALS                                                                                                          The South African government has cut back on fringebenefits in proposed tax measures. The amendments includereductions in company taxes to 48% from 50%. The changesinclude a big increase in taxes on company cars and a cut inthe auto-expense allowance. Also, some benefits fordependents would be scrapped and those for retirees taxed.The measures, expected to clear Parliament next week, are totake effect Aug. 1.                                                                                                          CHINA HOPES TO CURB BIRTHS                                                                                                          Beijing ordered a new drive to cut China's birth rate,including education efforts and penalties for bearingunapproved children, such as fines of three to 55 timesannual pay, pay freezes, and loss of housing andsocial-services benefits.   &quot;Population-control work must be considered as importantas economic construction,&quot; the government said. In a newmove, Beijing directed local governments to beginbirth-control work among China's minorities, though it leftrules and methods to local authorities. The minoritynationalities, which make up less than 10% of the population,previously were largely exempt from birth limits.   China trimmed its birth rate from 33 per 1,000 residentsin 1970, before the state launched its &quot;one child per family&quot;policy in urban areas, to 21 per 1,000 last year. Still,Beijing said, the population has grown in recent years at anannual rate exceeding 16 million.   The world's most populous country, with 1.1 billionpeople, faces a new population surge in this decade fromthose born in the 1970s. Beijing has warned that thepopulation could reach 1.3 billion by the year 2000.

Sweden notified the European Community it intends to applyfor membership in the trade and political association, whichnow has 12 member states. . . . Italy's Defense Ministry willsend conscientious objectors to work in state museums toextend their hours, starting July 15. The extra staff willmake it harder for guards to shut down museums throughstrikes, a tactic that hurts tourism every summer.</TEXT></DOC>
