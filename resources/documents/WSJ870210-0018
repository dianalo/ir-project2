A spokesman for the unit, which designs industrial automation equipment and controls, said the move is part of an expansion of the company's target customer industries.    The spokesman said the Milwaukee-based unit already has expanded from its original automotive and machine-tool automation businesses into automation of the food processing, petrochemical, mining and metals and forest-products industries. &quot;In the past, we haven't made much effort in contracting directly with the government,&quot; the spokesman said, adding that the company won't limit itself to military and defense areas.    Rockwell is an aerospace, auto parts and defense concern. </TEXT></DOC>
