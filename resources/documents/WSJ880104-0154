The prediction, made last Thursday, followed statements earlier in the week by French Foreign Trade Minister Michel Noir that the lower dollar was a &quot;catastrophe&quot; for Airbus Industrie and will force the European consortium to sell its wide-bodied jets at a loss. British Aerospace has a 20% stake in Airbus.    British Aerospace wouldn't give a figure for its second-half deficit but said it likely was wider than the #49 million ($92.4 million) trading loss from the civil-aircraft division in the first half.    About half that trading loss resulted from British Aerospace's 20% Airbus share; the rest came from the company's own range of civil aircraft. The figure included provisions against future losses from Airbus and the other aircraft.    &quot;The exchange-rate position has gotten worse since then, so it's obvious we will continue to show losses,&quot; said a British Aerospace spokesman. The company has been warning about the effect of the lower dollar on its civil-aircraft operations since April 1987, he noted. </TEXT></DOC>
