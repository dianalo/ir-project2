Changes in the coal market, due to activity or inactivity of countries,has caused the price per tonne of coal to fall in the last couple ofyears. There is competition from other fuels. Whereas many competingfuels are sold at prices many times the cost of production, coal pricesbarely cover its total costs. However, gas reserve to production ratiosare low in some key parts of the world. Venezuelan extra heavy crudecosts undercut those of coal and the country has an immense reserve.The low priced fuel poses the most immediate threat to the growth ofthe international coal trade. Coal has advantages over oil such as nocartel, no paper market and the fact that the coal reserves which feedthe OECD nations are largely based in OECD nations. Three countries,Australia, China and South Africa are considered in the light of theinternational coal trade - Australia the largest supplier of steam coal,China with its cheap but unreliable coal and South Africa, whose markethas been cut by sanctions. Long term contracts are considered in thelight of the privatization of the British electricity supply industry.The future of the coal market is considered. 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
