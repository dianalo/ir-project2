 Typically, thecorporate LAN is capable of meeting the requirements of high-speedmultiple access to a corporate data base.andP;  But when a number oflaser printers are receiving data at a rate of 8,000-bps or more,serious bottlenecks can result, since a typical LAN can deliverdata to a printer at only about 3,000-bps.andP;  The peripheral sharingdevice, providing a direct connection from microcomputer toprinter, can speed up this process to as much as 12,000-bps.andP;  Somedevices offer additional capabilities such as file sharing andautomatic data backup.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Local Area NetworksDevice HandlingPeripheral ServersPrintersData Transfer RateThroughput.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>A majority of companies have installed or are thinking of installing a LANfor two reasons: share data at high speeds and share printers.andM;But while the speed with which LANs can share data is amazing, the speed withwhich they print on a shared printer is, by comparison, slow.andM;And when it comes to printing graphics, the speed becomes even slower,creating a bottleneck at the printer.andP;  Combine this with the growing demandsfor better looking graphics presentation materials and that bottleneck israpidly getting worse.andM;But there is good news.andP;  Graphics printing does not have to cause a LANbottleneck.andM;Forward looking corporations are developing strategies that use LANs andperipheral sharing devices designed specifically to handle sophisticatedprinter sharing, including the printing of complex graphics.andM;This strategy gives companies the option to use the best type of networkingequipment where it is needed.andP;  In departments where the primary need ishigh-speed multi-user access to common databases, a LAN is used.andM;But in departments where printer and peripheral sharing is the primary need,a peripheral sharing device is installed either as a standalone or on acoexisting basis with the LAN, avoiding the graphics printing bottleneck thatplagues even faster LANs.andM;LANs run into problems with graphics printing because they cannot keep upwith the relatively high speed of today's laser printers -- for example aHewlett Packard LaserJet Series II can receive graphics data at 8,000 bytesor characters per second (bps).andM;A typical 10 MB Token Ring network running Novell software on an unloadedbasis delivers data to a printer at approximately 3,000 bps, only one fourththe printer's capacity.andP;  Users therefore, end up waiting 15 to 20 minutes fora single graphics page to be printed.andM;Why does graphics printing take so long?andP;  Unlike text printing wherefully-formed characters are sent to the printer, graphics characters arecomposed of pixels (picture elements) which are sent individually to theprinter.andM;A single character printed on a 300 by 300 bpi (bytes per inch) printer mighthave up to 90,000 pixels.andP;  The stream of data that is required to transmitjust one graphics character is obviously large.andP;  This data stream growsexponentially when an entire page of graphics is sent to the printer andcorrespondingly the printer takes more time to print a full page.andM;Most high-speed PCs can keep up with graphics printing if they have aparallel connection.andP;  But when a network comes between the printer and thePCs, printing slows down to a net throughput speed of approximately 3,000bytes per second, and a bottleneck of data is created.andM;A peripheral sharing device does not use a server; it provides a connectiondirectly from the PCs to the printer.andP;  The device allows data to betransmitted to the PC as fast as a PC directly connected to a printer.andM;Peripheral sharing hardware has been optimized for printing especially whenit comes to graphics.andM;Various peripheral sharing products are available today, with most deliverprint jobs to a printer at 1,000 to 4,000 bytes per second (are equal orsuperior to the Token Ring speeds) while the best products offer speeds of12,000 bps or higher parallel.andM;Twelve-thousand bps is approximately the same speed the printer can receivedata and almost four times the speed that a LAN, with an average load, cansend data.andP;  The speed of these products allows users to send complex graphicprint jobs to the printer and return to other tasks on their computer savingtime for users who do graphics printing.andM;The reason these products can achieve higher speeds than LANs is that theyhave: separate hardware buffer memory that holds data prior to its beingprinted; and firmware that has been tuned to high-speed printing operations.andM;In addition to providing highspeed throughput for printing, some peripheralsharing devices also offer file sharing and automatic data backup on each PCon the peripheral sharing device.andM;This could be beneficial to a small department or work group whose primaryneed is highspeed printer access and secondary needs include file sharing andbackup.andM;The peripheral sharing device answers the department's needs at a fraction ofthe cost of a LAN.andM;Many companies use peripheral sharing devices and LANs on a complementarybasis.andM;The PC is connected to the LAN with a PC card for database sharing and hostlinks and to the peripheral sharing device, through the PC's serial orparallel port, for printer and peripheral sharing.andM;In this scenario, the user gets the improved printing throughput of theperipheral sharing device and the printing work load on the LAN isalleviated.andP;  It also eliminates the need for a PC to be dedicated a printerserver on the LAN.andM;Adding a peripheral sharing device to the overall corporate networkingstrategy provides the company with a tool that makes efficient use ofresources (expensive peripherals) and user time.andP;  It is this effective use ofavailable resources that provides maximum benefit from the availableapplications.andM;Major corporations have already recognized the value of a complementaryLAN/peripheral sharing device strategy because it gives them a full set ofprice and performance choices to offer users.andM;The increasing importance of graphics printing makes this sort of evaluationeven more critical.andP;  The best LAN in the world installed in a group thatneeds fast graphics printing will not solve those users' needs and will onlybecome a source of frustration.andP;  It makes much more sense to use expensive,powerful networks where they are required and to leave the printer sharing tothe experts.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
