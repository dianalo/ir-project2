The takeover of four troubled thrifts in Iowa and Florida by the Statesman Group, a Des Moines, Iowa-based, diversified securities and insurance business, highlighted the greater regulatory freedom allowed to thrifts, compared with banks.    Bank Board spokeswoman Nancy Cohen said some state-chartered thrifts are affiliated with securities firms. But she said the Bank Board had refused to approve acquisition of thrifts by securities firms for at least five years. The new flexibility may raise the appeal of thrifts for diversified financial firms with securities activities.    Banks, by contrast, are barred from common ownership with securities underwriting firms by the Glass-Steagall Act, and Congress is locked in a battle over whether to repeal it. Even if banks can break down that barrier, the change may be phased in over several years, and tough restrictions on dealings between the securities and bank businesses are expected to persist.    Unhampered by Glass-Steagall, the Bank Board said it would allow Statesman's securities and thrift businesses to market each other's products. It imposed &quot;temporary safeguards on certain transactions&quot; for six months between the two activities while it considers what long-term restrictions are needed. Ms. Cohen said the temporary restrictions included a bar against the securities firm passing on insider information about securities deals, but she lacked further details.    The Bank Board's arrangement gives Statesman Group control over First Federated Savings Bank of North Palm Beach, Fla., and three thrifts in Waterloo, Iowa: Perpetual Savings andamp; Loan Association, First Federal Savings Bank and Peoples Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association. The thrifts had negative net worth totaling $89.8 million, according to the Bank Board.    The Bank Board said it contributed an estimated $157 million in cash, notes and other assistance to make the acquisition possible. Statesman agreed to invest $8.4 million in the thrifts. The thrifts' branches are to reopen today as branches of Statesman Bank for Savings.    Separately, the six branches and all deposits of the insolvent, First Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, Paducah, Ky., were taken over by Security Trust Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, the Oak Ridge, Tenn.-based unit of Security Savings andamp; Loan Association, Jackson, Miss. The Bank Board paid $145 million to make the transfer of deposits. The First Federal offices are to open today as branches of Security Trust.    The Bank Board said First Federal's assets were listed as $130 million, but that about 42% of them were nonperforming loans. Many of the bad loans were concentrated in the Houston area, the Bank Board said. In liquidating First Federal's assets, the Bank Board said it expects to recover all but $52.3 million of its costs. First Federal's liabilities were $167.9 million. </TEXT></DOC>
