An Iraqi statement said the Iranians were pushed across theborder after 10 hours of fighting in an offensive called ``On GodWe Depend.''   Iraq also said its warplanes made a long-range bombing raid onan important power plant near Iran's border with the Soviet Union.   Iran initially claimed to have repelled the Iraqi assault in theSalamchah region, which its Revolutionary Guards seized at greatcost in January and February of last year.   Several hours later, the official Islamic Republic News Agencyannounced: ``Following heavy clashes ... the Moslem forces of Iranhad to retreat from parts of the area they had captured before. TheMoslem forces are responding to heavy artillery fire.''   It said Iranian planes ``heavily bombed'' Iraqi troopconcentrations, inflicting ``substantial losses in men andequipment.''   An Iraqi communique distributed by the official Iraqi NewsAgency said five Iranian divisions were ``wiped out'' and survivorsretreated across the frontier. It did not give figures, but anIranian division usually averages about 10,000 men.   There was no way to confirm the Iraqi casualty claim. U.S.military analysts estimate Iran lost at least 25,000 soldiers inlast year's battle for Basra and about 10,000 Iraqis were killed.   Conflicting reports seldom can be verified because neutralobservers have been allowed into battle zones only rarely since thewar began in September 1980.   Loss of the bridgehead near Basra would extend a string ofIranian defeats that began when Iraq's 7th Army Corps, led by elitePresidential Guards, pushed the Iranians off the Faw Peninsulasouth of Basra on April 16-18. Iran had held the marshy finger ofland for two years.   Also on April 18, the U.S. Navy destroyed two of Iran's offshoreoil Platforms in the Persian Gulf and sank or disabled six Iraniannaval craft in related confrontations.   Those defeats, combined with economic problems and politicaluncertainty within Iran, appear to have put Ayatollah RuhollahKhomeini's regime on the defensive after a long period ofinitiative in the ground war.   Baghdad said the 3rd Army Corps, again led by PresidentialGuards, moved before dawn to recapture the marshes around Fish Lakeeast of Basra.   Iraq created the artificial lake early in the war as a barrierto Iranian invasion, but Revolutionary Guards fought throughseveral Iraqi defense lines last year to take the wetlands.   A communique from Iraq said its soldiers pushed across theJassim and Duaiji rivers around Fish Lake on Wednesday and ``theIranian invaders have been defeated and driven outside ourinternational borders.''   President Saddam Hussein ``personally supervised theoffensive,'' traveling to the battlefield with his defenseminister, Gen. Adnan Khairallah, the communique said. It did notelaborate.   Baghdad radio interrupted regular programs to announce ``a greatvictory'' in an ``epic battle.'' Iraqi soldiers in the capitalfired automatic weapons into the air to celebrate.   Another Iranian report said its army repelled an Iraqicounterattack in the mountainous Sulaimaniyeh region of northeastIraq, where the Iran seized territory several weeks ago. Itreported ``heavy losses and casualties'' among the Iraqis.   Until the Faw offensive, Iraq had fought a static war since 1982behind defense lines of heavy artillery, tanks, rocket launchersand minefields. Their main offensive operation was a bombingcampaign against economic targets and Iranian cities.   Earlier this week, Khairallah told army commanders to be ``fullyready'' for new offensives ``if Iran insists on flouting'' a U.N.cease-fire resolution passed July 20.   Iraq has said it will abide by the resolution if Iran does, butthe Iranians say there can be no truce until Iraq is designated theaggressor. Iraq invaded Iran in September 1980 after borderskirmishes.   The defense minister said Iraq would seek to regain territoryseized by the Iranians. The Iranians still hold part of the Majnoonmarshes north of Basra and Iraqi territory in the mountainousKurdistan region of the north.   Dispatches from Baghdad said Iraqi warplanes flew more than 600miles to bomb the Neka power station on the Caspian Sea, 125 milesnortheast of Tehran, ``turning it into ashes.'' The Iraqi air forcealso bombed the plant several months ago.   Iran said bombs struck the homes of workers near the powerstation but it gave no details. IRNA said other Iraqi jets raidedSardasht, a northwestern border town, killing 29 civilians.   An Iraqi military spokesman said no raids were conducted in theSardasht region. He said Iran was trying ``to justify Iranianbombing of Iraqi residential areas and to cover up its defeats .. .on the battlefield.''</TEXT></DOC>
