Seventy percent of all single people admitted to a nursing home go broke within three months; 50% of all couples are impoverished within six months after one spouse is admitted.    Amid growing concern about such crippling expenses, a few employers have begun adding a low-cost option to their benefits packages: insurance for long-term care.    The coverage, which helps pay for a stay in a nursing home or for care in one's own home, has been available in recent years outside the workplace through individual policies. But these policies are often costly and limited in the type of care they cover.    Employers, however, are providing cheaper, more comprehensive group plans. Within the past 18 months, four companies and three states -- Alaska, Maryland and Ohio -- have decided to sponsor long-term-care group coverage for their workers. And almost half of 147 large employers responding to a survey by the Washington Business Group on Health last fall said they were likely to offer similar programs within the next five years. Insurers say they are designing more extended-care group plans in anticipation of the increased demand.    Companies &quot;are recognizing the vulnerability of employees to long-term costs,&quot; says Anthony Gajda, a principal at Mercer Meidinger Hansen Inc., a benefits-consulting firm in New York. &quot;It's going to be an important, widespread benefit in the near future.&quot;    The pioneering group plans aren't without drawbacks, though. Currently, workers have to pay all the premiums for the insurance, although at a lower rate than they would pay for an individual policy. And young employees who take part may be buying coverage today that ends up providing insufficient help in the future.    &quot;None of the policies adequately address the issue of inflation,&quot; says Joshua Wiener, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington. &quot;In 40 years, (a daily benefit of) $50 or $100 isn't going to be worth very much.&quot;    Some employers, meanwhile, are concerned that if they begin offering the coverage as an option, they soon will be pressured to start paying employees' premiums as a standard benefit. That would add to the already substantial corporate costs of retirees' health coverage.    Nonetheless, in the absence of adequate federal support, the group plans may be the only affordable way many people can prepare for this possible expense, healthcare consultants say.    The likelihood of needing long-term care is increasing. In 1980, 25 million people in the U.S. were age 65 or older. That number will double in the next 20 years. And people who reach age 65 have a 30% to 50% chance of spending some time in a nursing home before they die.    The cost of that care? An average of about $22,000 a year, according to the Brookings Institution, and rising rapidly. Between 1966 and 1982, nursing-home costs increased at an average annual rate of 15%. Thirty years from now, a 12-month stay in a nursing home will likely cost about $55,000, the Brookings Institution estimates.    About 70 insurers now offer individual policies to help pay for extended care. But a recent study of 53 plans by Consumer Reports magazine found that many of the policies are expensive and restrictive. For example, some of the policies don't pay benefits to care for people who develop Alzheimer's disease. Others require that policyholders first spend time in a hospital before long-term-care benefits are paid. The new employer-sponsored plans offer lower premiums -- about 30% below those of individual policies -- and have less restrictions on when benefits can be paid.    The plan at American Express Co. is fairly typical. Employees and their spouses have a choice of two benefit plans: one that pays $100 a day for nursing-home care and $50 a day for home care, or one that pays half those amounts. The premiums vary by age. A person age 40 to 44, for example, would pay about $18 a month for the first plan and about $9 a month for the second. Once a person enters the program, the premiums are fixed for his or her lifetime.    Benefits under the American Express plan start 90 days after a policyholder begins to receive extended care, and a hospital stay isn't required. The maximum payouts are $150,000 for nursing-home care and $75,000 for home care. Policyholders who leave the company can continue the coverage.    Most of the corporate programs also allow employees' parents and in-laws to participate. That's because employers are discovering that more of their workers are responsible for caring for an elderly relative, an often demanding and draining task.    Says Nancy Bern, vice president of John Hancock Financial Services' elderly products division, which sells long-term-care insurance: &quot;A program like this that solves a critical problem at home will relieve (employees) of stress and financial strain and make them more effective on the job.&quot;    Kevin Flatley, vice president for employee benefits at American Express, says about 7% of eligible employees, or 1,500 people, have enrolled in the program since January. Other companies report similar responses. John Hancock says about 8% of its employees have signed up; Procter andamp; Gamble Co. says 9% have enrolled.    Although executives say they are pleased with the number of workers signing up for these new programs, they point out that larger numbers of employees in their 30s and 40s must participate to spread the risk and keep premiums low. If only older or ailing employees enroll, says Mr. Flatley, &quot;the whole program crashes and burns.&quot;    Attracting some of those younger employees can be difficult. &quot;A lot of time and energy has to be invested&quot; in educating workers about long-term-care insurance, says Ms. Bern. &quot;This isn't an immediately obvious need.&quot;    Adds John Dwyer, an actuary in the employee-benefits department at Travelers Corp.: &quot;We have to get employers to tell employees what their current health plans don't cover. Usually, you accentuate the positive; here you have to point out the holes in the safety net.&quot;    Clarifying the tax status of the insurance plans could also help make the programs more attractive, says Robert Levin, a director at the Washington Business Group on Health. The Internal Revenue Service hasn't ruled whether the programs are a &quot;qualified benefit&quot; under Section 125 of the IRS Code. That rule allows employees to allocate a portion of their salaries -- before they are taxed -- to pay for child care and other qualified expenses.    If employees &quot;can set aside funds on a pretax basis,&quot; says Mr. Levin, then long-term care plans &quot;become a more affordable benefit.&quot;    Benefits consultants and personnel managers predict that as young employees become more aware of the costs of extended care, they will look for ways to protect themselves -- and will turn to employer -- sponsored insurance plans.    &quot;I like to plan for the future,&quot; says 39-year-old Linda Ulrey, a Procter andamp; Gamble spokeswoman who is enrolled in the company's long-term care program. &quot;I'm in good health. But who knows what awaits me in the future?&quot;    ---               The Burden of Long-Term Care   Americans spent $35.2 billion on nursing-home care in 1985.
