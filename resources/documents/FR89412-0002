This new part consolidates, revises, and clarifies thepolicies, requirements, and procedures presently contained in various REApublications pertaining to acquisitions, mergers, and consolidations, includingthe following REA Bulletins:<ITAG tagnum="15">320-4 Preloan Procedures for Telephone Loan Applicants</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">325-1 Financing Lines, Facilities, or Systems Outside of Rural Areas</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">326-1 Acquisitions of Telephone Facilities and Systems</ITAG>The above Bulletins also contain certain other policies, requirements,and procedures that will be incorporated into other CFR parts. These Bulletinswill then be rescinded.Part 1750 sets forth the provisions and requirements of the RE Act andthe REA administrative policies, requirements, and procedures concerningthe acquisition, merger, or consolidation of telephone facilities and systems.The primary objectives of the final rule are to update, consolidate, clarify,and simplify REA policies and procedures; to lessen the paperwork burdenon borrowers; and to decrease processing time by REA.All borrowers that are parties to an acquisition, merger, or consolidationwill be affected by this rule.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>April 12, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>F. Lamont Heppe, Jr., Chief, Loansand Management Branch, Telecommunications Staff Division, Rural ElectrificationAdministration, Room 2250, South Building, U.S. Department of Agriculture,Washington, DC 20250, telephone number (202) 382-9550. The Final RegulatoryImpact Analysis describing the options considered in developing this ruleis available on request from the above named individual.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>This rule is issued in conformity withExecutive Order 12291, Federal Regulation. This action will not (1) havean annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; (2) result ina major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, state or local government agencies, or geographic regions; or(3) result in significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investmentor productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.Therefore, this rule has been determined to be ``not major.''This action does not fall within the scope of the Regulatory FlexibilityAct. REA has concluded that promulgation of this rule would not representa major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the humanenvironment under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C.4321 <T3>et seq.</T3> (1976)) and, therefore, does not require an environmentalimpact statement or an environmental assessment.In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507),the reporting and recordkeeping provisions that are included in this finalrule have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). TheOMB approval number for these requirements is 0572-0084.Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimatedto average 16 hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions,searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed,and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send commentsregarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection ofinformation, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to Departmentof Agriculture, Clearance Officer, OIRM, Room 404-W, Washington, DC 20250;and to the Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project(OMB andplusmin;0572-0084), Washington, DC 20503.This program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance underNo. 10.851, Rural Telephone Loans and Loan Guarantees, and 10.852, RuralTelephone Bank Loans. For the reasons set forth in the final rule relatedNotice to 7 CFR 3015, Subpart V (50 FR 47034, November 14, 1985), thisprogram is excluded from the scope of Executive Order 12372 which requiresintergovernmental consultation with State and local officials.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>Currently, the policies and requirements concerning the acquisition, merger,or consolidation of telephone facilities and systems are contained in numerousREA Bulletins and REA Staff Instructions (internal instructions for REApersonnel). Many of these are outdated and contain conflicting information.It is necessary to consolidate the information and make it available tothe public by publishing it in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.This final rule eliminates some reporting requirements and streamlinesothers, reducing the borrowers' burden, while permitting REA to maintainthe security of the government's loans.REA does not permit loan funds to be used to acquire any stock or telephoneplant in service or under construction of an affiliated company. REA willno longer place a valuation on facilities acquired with funds other thanloan funds. Additionally, REA Forms 507, ``Report on Telephone Acquisition,''and 507a, ``Report on Telephone Acquisitions_by Exchange,'' have been combinedand considerably shortened.Article II, section 15(c) of the mortgage, which applies to each borrowerwith an adjusted net worth of less than 20 percent of adjusted assets,includes certain requirements in the event of a change in ownership interestsof the borrower, which in the sole opinion of the majority noteholdersmight adversely affect their security. Currently, these requirements arenormally applied if the ownership and control of a borrower is to be transferredto a non-operating holding company. In the future, transfer of ownershipto a non-operating holding company, in and of itself, will not be consideredto have an adverse effect on REA's security.7 CFR Part 1750 supersedes any sections of REA Bulletins with which itis in conflict.<ITAG tagnum="84">Comments</ITAG>In the Proposed Rule published on October 19, 1988, the Rural ElectrificationAdministration invited interested parties to file comments on or beforeNovember 18, 1988.Comments were received from: <ITAG tagnum="25">Missouri Telephone Company</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Eastern Missouri Telephone Company</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Telephone and Data Systems, Inc. (TDS)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Rural Telephone Finance Cooperative (RTFC)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">National Rural Telecom Association (NRTA)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">United States Telephone Association (USTA)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Organization for the Protection and Advancement of Small TelephoneCompanies (OPASTCO)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC)</ITAG>The comments received addressed the following issues and sections of theRule:<ITAG tagnum="84">Extension of Time for Comments</ITAG>Several respondents requested an extension of the 30 day time period forsubmission of written comments.Response_The 30 day public comment period was chosen because of the timeconstraints imposed by Pub. L. 100-203.<ITAG tagnum="84">Specific Time Frames</ITAG>Several respondents requested that REA set specific timeframes for itsactions in the following andSection;andSection; 1750.12(a), 1750.12(b), 1750.24(a)(7),1750.30(k) and 1750.55(c).Response_REA will carry out its responsibilities in a timely manner. Dueto the different conditions and characteristics of each merger or acquisition,it is not possible to set specific time frames that would be appropriatefor all circumstances.andSection; 1750.2 REA field representative assistance.Several respondents proposed the elimination of this section because itmerely advises, but does not require, the borrower to first discuss itsplans with the GFR.<T3>Response:</T3> REA believes that this advice should be retained becauseit would help expedite plans for an acquisition or merger. This sectionhas been retained.andSection; 1750.3(a) Definitions_Acquisition.Several respondents objected to the definition of ``acquisition'' and proposedthat ``Only when the size of the facility purchase rises to the level ofa purchase of all of the assets of a company, or all of the assets neededto serve one or more exchanges, should the transaction be deemed an acquisition.''<T3>Response:</T3> The RE Act specifically refers to ``acquisition . .. of lines, faciliti8es or systems'', which includes all acquisitions regardlessof size. The definition has not been changed.andSection; 1750.3(j) Definitions_Interim financing.Several respondents requested a clearer definition of interim financingto indicate the fact that the borrower has applied for REA financing toreplace the interim financing.<T3>Response:</T3> The definition has been changed to clarify this point.Further explanation of interim financing is contained in 7 CFR 1749, SubpartE.andSection; 1750.10(a)(3) Specific provisions.One respondent asked whether REA approval of an acquisition or merger isrequired if a borrower has an adjusted net worth greater than 20 percentof adjusted assets.<T3>Response:</T3> All borrowers, regardless of net worth, must obtainwritten approval of the majority noteholders before taking any action toreorganize, consolidate or merge into any other organization. When a borrower'sadjusted net worth is less than 20 percent of adjusted assets, certainadditional requirements apply under Article II, section 15(c) of the mortgage.Several respondents requested that REA ``specify the criteria it will considerin reaching a determination that REA's loan security is adversely affectedby an acquisition or merger,'' thus invoking Article II, section 15(c)of the mortgage.<T3>Response:</T3> Due to the varying circumstances under which acquisitionsor mergers may occur, it is impossible to specify in advance all relevantcriteria that need to be considered when determining if the government'ssecurity will be adversely affected by an acquisition or merger. Transferof ownership to a non-operating holding company, in and of itself, willnot be considered to have an adverse effect on REA's security.andSection; 1750.11(c) Approval criteria.Several respondents commented that REA should specify all criteria usedin approving an acquisition or merger and that the words ``among othermatters'' be deleted.<T3>Response:</T3> REA has specified the major factors to be consideredwhen approving a merger or acquisition. Due to the individuality of eachcase, it is impossible to specify in advance all factors that may be relevant.andSection; 1750.11(c)(3) Approval criteria.Several respondents commented that the words ``is in the best interestof the Government'' are too subjective and undefined. One of them proposedsubstituting the words: ``might adversely affect the government's security.''<T3>Response:</T3> REA has other interests besides security. This wordingwill be retained.andSection; 1750.11(c)(4) Approval criteriaSeveral respondents commented that the meaning of ``excessive rates'' wasundefined.<T3>Response:</T3> ``Excessive rates'' was meant to refer to rates thatwould endanger the financial feasibility of the proposed system. The words``excessive rates'' have been eliminated.Several respondents requested that REA clarify the conditions that wouldconstitute ``endangerment of financial feasibility.''<T3>Response:</T3> Due to the varying circumstances under which acquisitionsor mergers may occur, it is impossible to specify in advance all conditionswhich would constitute endangerment of financial feasibility. In consideringwhether to approve a request for a merger or acquisition, REA will takeinto consideration any factors relevant to a specific proposal that, inthe opinion of REA, might have an adverse effect on the government's security.andSection; 1750.12(b)(1) Approval of acquisitions and mergers.Several respondents requested that ``compensating benefits'' be definedand that examples be provided.<T3>Response:</T3> A compensating benefit is required whenever the governmentrelinquishes, impairs, or waives any of its rights or powers. This requirementis not limited to cases where the security of the government's loan isaffected. Since various mergers and acquisitions involve many widely differingcircumstances, the compensating benefits required, if any, for governmentapproval can be determined only on a case-by-case basis. However, in thepast, the following actions, often in combination, have been consideredto provide some degree of compensation to the government, depending onthe facts in the particular case: (1) Prepayment, (2) accelerated payment,and (3) agreement by the borrower not to borrow from REA again. In addition,the government may consider other actions to provide a compensating benefit.andSection; 1750.12(b)(3) Approval of acquisitions and mergers.One respondent requested clarification of the requirement that borrowersnot extend credit to, perform services for, or receive services from affiliatedcompanies, unless authorized by the Administrator.<T3>Response:</T3> REA needs a broad-based prohibition on various typesof transactions between insiders that might jeopardize loan security orotherwise be contrary to the interests of the government.andSection; 1750.12(b)(4) Approval of acquisitions and mergers.Several respondents requested clarification of under what circumstancesREA may require additional documentation for the approval of an acquisitionor merger.<T3>Response:</T3> It is impossible to specify in advance all of the circumstancesthat may require additional documentation. While not all acquisitions ormergers will require additional documentation, some will. The type of additionaldocumentation required will be determined by the specific characteristicsof the proposed acquisition or merger.andSection; 1750.20(b) Use of loan funds.Several respondents objected to REA's use of ``necessary and incidental''as a test for providing financing for an acquisition.<T3>Response:</T3> The test for financing acquisitions reflects REA's interpretationof the Act as it has been consistently applied since the inception of theREA loan program. Section 201 of the Act, which explicitly permits loansfor the acquisition of telephone facilities, provides that the primarypurpose of the loan must be to furnish and improve telephone service inrural areas. Pursuant to section 201, REA has approved loans that includefunds for acquiring facilities only when REA determined that financingthe acquisition of facilities was a necessary and incidental means to accomplishingthe primary purpose of the loan_furnishing and improving telephone servicein rural areas. This determination can be made only on a case-by-case basis.The legal principles underlying this interpretation and its applicationto specific cases are set forth in several opinions of the Office of GeneralCounsel, Department of Agriculture.andSection; 1750.20(c) Use of loan funds.Several respondents requested that this section be deleted, stating thatthere is nothing in the Act that prohibits providing financing for thepurpose of merging or consolidating telephone organizations.<T3>Response:</T3> It has been a long-standing practice of REA not to providethis type of financing. Pursuant to the Act, the purpose of any financingmust be to furnish or improve telephone service in rural areas. Providingfinancing for the <T3>sole</T3> purpose of merging or consolidating telephone organizationsis not consonant with this purpose, and REA has never made loans on thisbasis. Concurrent with a merger or consolidation, REA has and will continueto consider making loans to the surviving telephone system to finance theimprovement or extension of telephone service in rural areas. This pointhas been clarified.andSection; 1750.20(d) Use of loan funds.Several respondents requested that this section, which sets forth policyon acquisitions of existing borrowers, be deleted.<T3>Response:</T3> If the property to be acquired is in the possessionof an existing REA borrower, financing is already available to that borrowerin order to furnish or improve telephone service in that area and thusthe financing of such acquisition is not ``necessary'' within the meaningof the Act. If, in REA's opinion, the government's security is endangered,REA may consider providing financing for an acquisition of an existingborrower if such acquisition, in the opinion of REA, would improve thelikelihood of repayment of an outstanding REA loan. This section has beenrevised to further clarify REA's position.andSection; 1750.20(e) Use of loan funds.Several respondents objected to the words ``any other factors deemed relevantby REA'' and requested that REA state what specific factors they woulduse in determining the amount REA will lend for an acquisition.<T3>Response:</T3> Due to the varying circumstances under which acquisitionsmay occur, it is impossible to specify in advance all relevant factorsthat need to be considered when placing a value on facilities to be acquired.Several respondents commented that the meaning of ``excessive rates'' wasundefined.<T3>Response:</T3> See the response to the comment on andSection; 1750.11(c)(4).Several respondents requested that REA clarify the conditions that wouldconstitute ``endangerment of financial feasibility.''<T3>Response:</T3> See the response to the comment on andSection; 1750.11(c)(4).andSection; 1750.21 Nonrural areas.Several respondents objected to including ``incidental'' in the test forfinancing acquisitions of facilities in nonrural areas.<T3>Response:</T3> This test reflects REA's interpretation of the Act asit has been consistently applied since the inception of the program. Pursuantto this interpretation REA has included loan funds to finance facilitiesin non-rural areas only when the <T3>primary purpose</T3> of the loan is to furnish or improve service inrural areas, and REA determines that the financing of urban facilitiesis necessary and incidental to accomplish this primary purpose. This determinationhas and can be made only on a case-by-case basis. A discussion of the legalprinciples underlying this interpretation of the Act, as well as its applicationin specific cases, is set forth in a series of opinions of the Office ofGeneral Counsel, Department of Agriculture.andSection; 1750.22 Acquisition agreements.Several respondents commented that the word ``normally'' is not acceptableregulatory language and requested that REA list all conditions that wouldresult in the approval of an acquisition prior to loan approval.<T3>Response:</T3> Due to the varying circumstances under which an acquisitionmay occur, it is impossible to specify in advance all circumstances thatmight result in the approval of an acquisition prior to loan approval.The word ``normally'' allows REA flexibility to approve an acquisitionfor cases which, in the opinion of REA, merit such approval of prior toloan approval.andSection; 1750.24(a)(2) Submission of data.Several respondents requested that all referenced forms be published inthe proposed rule.<T3>Response:</T3> Since many forms are referenced in more than one regulation,it would be too costly to revise several regulations each time a form ischanged. Required forms are available from REA upon request. See andSection;1750.4.andSection; 1750.24(a)(4) Submission of data.Several respondents requested that the word ``Plans'' be replaced with``A brief statement of the plans''.<T3>Response:</T3> This change has been made.andSection; 1750.24(a)(8)(vi) Submission of data.Several respondents requested that this section be deleted because it isonly advisory.<T3>Response:</T3> The section has been revised to clarify REA's position.andSection; 1750.24(a)(14) Submission of data.Several respondents requested that this section be deleted, stating thatREA should list all items required for evaluating an acquisition.<T3>Response:</T3> Due to the varying circumstances under which acquisitionsmay occur, it is impossible to specify in advance all relevant factorsthat need to be considered when evaluating a specific acquisition.andSection; 1750.25 Interim financing.One respondent requested that REA specify the circumstances under whichit will provide shared first mortgage security and/or a lien accommodationfor non-REA lenders as it pertains to interim financing of acquisitions.<T3>Response:</T3> These circumstances are set forth in 7 CFR Part 1747,Lien Accommodations and Subordination Policy. A reference to 7 CFR Part1747 has been added to this section.andSection; 1750.25(c)(3) Interim financing.Several respondents commented that this section is burdensome on the borrower,unnecessary, and should be deleted.<T3>Response:</T3> This section is necessary in order to determine whetherthe property to be acquired will qualify for REA financing as set forthin andSection; 1750.25(d).andSection; 1750.25(c)(5) Interim financing.Several respondents commented that this section is undefined and subjective,and should be deleted.<T3>Response:</T3> Each acquisition must be thoroughly evaluated beforea determination can be made whether or not a borrower qualifies for interimfinancing. It is impossible to anticipate all of the facts that need tobe considered in approving interim financing. Therefore, the Administratorneeds discretion to determine, in each case, whether all of the informationnecessary to approve interim financing for an acquisition has been obtained.andSection; 1750.25(d) Interim financing.Several respondents requested that this section be eliminated or amendedto state the standards by which REA will consider financing.<T3>Response:</T3> The requirements for an acquisition to qualify for REAfinancing are set forth in 7 CFR Part 1745.20.andSection; 1750.26 Acquisition of affiliates.Several respondents commented that the Act does not prohibit the use ofloan funds for the acquisition of an affiliate, and therefore, this sectionshould be deleted.<T3>Response:</T3> A loan for the acquisition of an affiliate would notbe necessary to extend or improve telephone service, within the meaningof the Act, due to common control of affiliated companies. This sectionwill be retained.andSection; 1750.27(c) Release of loan funds, requisitions, advances.Several respondents commented that the words ``to REA's satisfaction''are subjective and unnecessary and proposed that they be eliminated.<T3>Response: </T3>The government must retain the ability to satisfy itselfthat an acquisition has been finalized since the use and security of millionsof dollars in REA loans are at stake.andSection; 1750.27(d) Release of loan funds, requisitions, advances.Several respondents proposed that this section regarding title requirementsbe deleted because REA Bulletins cannot be used to deny a loan or advancein accordance with Pub. L. 100-203.<T3>Response:</T3> Title requirements are a matter of contractual obligationof the borrower under the loan contract. Therefore the reference to REABulletin 380-1 has been deleted and title requirements will be codifiedin a future rule.andSection; 1750.30(d) Submission of data.Several respondents requested that the word ``Plans'' be replaced with``A brief statement of the plans''.<T3>Response:</T3> This change has been made.andSection; 1750.30(l) Submission of data.Several respondents commented that this section is undefined and unnecessary,and requested that it be deleted.<T3>Response: </T3>The Administrator has the responsibility to determine,on a case by case basis, whether all of the information necessary to evaluatean acquisition or merger has been obtained in order to ensure that thegovernment's security is reasonable adequate.andSection; 1750.41 Location of facilities.Several respondents requested that this section be deleted because thegeographic locations of telephone facilities would not necessarily adverselyaffect operating efficiency and therefore should not be considered in anacquisition.<T3>Response:</T3> The location of facilities to be acquired would notnecessarily adversely affect operating efficiency, however, in some casesit could. The Administrator must have discretion to determine that thefacilities financed are so located as to provide adequate security forthe REA loan.andSection; 1750.42(a) Accounting considerations.Several respondents requested that reference to ``REA'' be amended to read``Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or other accounting conventions,as appropriate''.<T3>Response: </T3>The wording in this section has been modified to specifybasis for REA determination that, in the absence of a regulatory commission,proper accounting has been applied.andSection; 1750.42(b) Accounting considerations.Several respondents commented that REA should have no jurisdiction overdepreciation rates and requested that this section be deleted.<T3>Response:</T3> REA has legitimate security and feasibility interestsin how depreciation is handled in the case of an acquisition and has clearlyindicated that a determination will be made only in cases where a regulatorybody does not have jurisdiction.andSection; 1750.43 Notes.Several respondents requested that this section be deleted, stating thatthey see no reason for the requirement of substitute notes in the caseof an acquisition or merger.<T3>Response:</T3> This section is included to allow flexibility for circumstancesthat might arise resulting in the need for substitute notes.andSection; 1750.45(2)(b) Unadvanced loan funds.One respondent requested that this section be modified to restrict onlythose funds advanced by REA.<T3>Response: </T3>``Construction fund'' is defined as the REA ConstructionAccount required by andSection; 2.4 of the standard loan contract into whichall <T3>REA loan funds </T3>are advanced. The meaning of ``other money'' inthis section is money that the borrower is contractually required to depositin this account, the use of which is also subject to REA approval. Fundsprovided by other lenders would be under control of the applicable documentspertaining to those funds. andSection;1750.50 Use of loan funds.Several respondents objected to including ``incidental'' in the test forthe acquisition of toll line facilities. They also objected to the requirementsof an acquisition agreement, original cost less depreciation valuation,connecting company concurrence, and a detailed inventory as being ``excessiveand unnecessarily burdensome'' for the acquisition of a toll line only.<T3>Response:</T3> The test for financing acquisitions reflects REA's interpretationof the Act as it has been consistently applied since the inception of theREA loan program. Section 201 of the Act, which explicitly permits loansfor the acquisition of telephone facilities, provides that the primarypurpose of the loan must be to furnish or improve telephone service inrural areas. Pursuant to section 201, the Administrator has approved loansthat included funds for acquiring facilities only when the Administratordetermined that financing the acquisition of facilities was a necessaryand incidental means to accomplishing the primary purpose of the loan_furnishingor improving telephone service in rural areas. This determination can bemade only on a case-by-case basis taking into account such matters as subscriberratios and cost ratios. The legal principles underlying this interpretationand its application to certain cases are set forth in several opinionsof the Office of General Counsel, Department of Agriculture.The information listed for submission in this section is necessary in orderfor REA to determine that security for the loan is adequate.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 1750</ITAG>Loan programs_communications, Telecommunications, Telephone.Therefore, REA amends 7 CFR Chapter XVII by adding the following new Part1750:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 1750_ACQUISITIONS, MERGERS, AND CONSOLIDATIONS_TELEPHONE PROGRAM</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart A_General</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1750.1 General statement.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1750.2 REA Field Representative Assistance.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1750.3 Definitions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1750.4 Availability of forms.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart B_Mortgage Controls on Acquisitions and Mergers</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1750.10 Specific provisions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1750.11 Approval criteria.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1750.12 Approval of acquisitions and mergers.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart C_Acquisitions Involving Loan Funds</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1750.20 Use of loan funds.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1750.21 Nonrural areas.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1750.22 Acquisition agreements.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1750.23 Loan design.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1750.24 Submission of data.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1750.25 Interim financing.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1750.26 Acquisition of affiliates.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1750.27 Release of loan funds, requisitions, advances.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart D_Acquisitions or Mergers Not Involving Additional Loan Funds</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1750.30 Submission of data.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart E_Requirements for All Acquisitions and Mergers</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1750.40 Preliminary approvals.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1750.41 Location of facilities.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1750.42 Accounting considerations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1750.43 Notes.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1750.44 Final approval and closing procedure.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1750.45 Unadvanced loan funds.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart F_Toll Line Acquisitions</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1750.50 Use of loan funds.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1750.51 With nonloan funds.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> 7 U.S.C. 901 et seq., 7 U.S.C. 1921 <T3>et seq.</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart A_General</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;1750.1</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">General statement.</ITAG>(a) The standard REA loan security documents (see 7 CFR Part 1758 or REABulletins 320-4, 320-22, 321-2, 322-2, 323-1, 326-1) contain provisionsregarding acquisitions, mergers, and consolidations.

(d) Generally, REA will not make a loan for the acquisition of an existingborrower unless, in addition to all other requirements, such acquisitionwill improve the likelihood of repayment of an outstanding REA loan andall outstanding balances of the previous REA loans are paid in full. (e) In determining the amount it will lend for each acquisition, REA shallplace a valuation on all telephone facilities that are to be acquired withloan funds. REA may consider fair market value, the original cost lessdepreciation of the facilities, income generating potential, any improvementin the financial strength of the borrower as a result of the acquisition,and any other factors deemed relevant by REA to determine the reasonablenessof the acquisition price and the amount of loan funds REA will providefor an acquisition.
