This paper reviews studiesconducted in the authors laboratory concerning photochemical transformationof PAA by near-ultraviolet (UVA) light and the increase in biologicalactivity of radiation-generated products. Cytotoxicity and mutagenicitywere measured in the Ames/Salmonella standard-plate assay; typically,in the absence of metabolic enzymes, unless determination for promutagenicchemicals was required. Chemical fractionation and identification ofvarious photoproducts was accomplished by high-performance liquid chromatography,and ultraviolet (UV) and infrared spectrophotometry, and mass spectrometry.Photooxidation of 2-aminofluorene (2-AF) can occur at the exocyclic nitrogenand at certain ring positions, resulting in the formation of direct-actingbacterial mutagens, including 2-nitrosofluorene, 2-nitrofluorene, and2-nitrofluoren-9-one. In addition, UVA-irradiated 2-AF solutions containpromutagenic compounds.</TEXT></DOC>
