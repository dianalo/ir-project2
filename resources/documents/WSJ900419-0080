Membership and revenues have grown by leaps andbounds, as the nearby table shows. Membership in theWilderness Society has multiplied by eight; the Sierra Cluband the National Audubon Society have seen their membershipsquintuple. The National Wildlife Federation's revenues havegrown tenfold.   Altogether, the revenues of the dozen largestenvironmental groups amount to roughly $250 million a year.And that doesn't include the revenues of the research outfitsthat provide the analysis that fuels the environmentalists'political activity -- big groups such as the World ResourcesInstitute and Worldwatch Institute, or the myriad of smalleractivist groups such as the Union of Concerned Scientists andFriends of the Earth.</LP><TEXT>   All that money has bought less environmental improvementthan it could have. The major environmental groups arecommitted to protecting the environment by exerting politicalpressure to change statutes, court interpretations ofstatutes and executive branch regulations. The tax lawsrequire that they limit their spending on direct lobbying to20% of their revenues, but in essence their entire programbudget is designed to change government laws and practices.Typically, this effort represents close to 75% of their totalbudget.   There are some exceptions, of course, mostly amongold-line organizations that continue programs started yearsago. The National Audubon Society, for example, devotes 14%of its $34 million in revenues to managing its wildlifesanctuaries, and the National Wildlife Federation spends atleast $11 million on children's nature education. For themost part, however, the leading environmental organizationslobby for current political change.   The trouble with this strategy is that it can only be aconstant battle. Even though environmentalists list withpride the vast number of environmental laws passed over thepast two decades -- from the Clean Air Act and its amendmentsto Superfund and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act-- they recognize that most are poorly implemented. They areconstantly going to court to force the EnvironmentalProtection Agency or the Forest Service to follow the law asthey see it. Often, their legislative achievements areundermined in the congressional appropriations process or byagencies of the executive branch that heed livestock ownersor timber producers more than environmentalists.   Lobbying is not just costly; it never ends. As the clichewould have it: you can't buy a vote, you can only rent it.One Congress can establish a wilderness, but the next has thelegal right to turn it into a nuclear waste facility.   Those who weren't adults at the time of the first EarthDay may find it hard to believe that a reversal ofenvironmentalism is possible; protecting the environment hasbeen politically popular for nearly two decades. They won'tremember that the state government of Pennsylvania used tohave bounties on hawks, that Oregon was officially committedto wiping out the sea lion and that during the 1960s theInterior Department considered damming the Grand Canyon.Political tides ebb as well as flow.   If environmental groups really want to save endangeredspecies and tropical rainforest, they would do well toconsider applying their ample revenues to purchasing land orprotective easements. Using some of their funds for purchasecould give them a permanent impact that is elusive today.   Consider the Wilderness Society's effort to get thegovernment to stop below-cost timber sales. On the theorythat the worst boondoggles should be the easiest to overturn,the society has been attacking logging in Alaska's TongassNational Forest. If the society's figures are correct,logging the Tongass is economically unjustified: It maintainsthat timber-cutting on the Tongass loses between 29 cents and93 cents for every taxpayer dollar spent. Yet a 1980 lawrequires the government to spend $40 million a year, ifnecessary, to support Tongass timber jobs. At 1,800 jobs (theWilderness Society's estimate), that is more than $20,000 perjob per year.   So far, the Wilderness Society's lobbying has accomplishedlittle. So why doesn't the society buy the land it wants toprotect? Although the Tongass is vast (the Forest Serviceowns more than 16 million acres), fewer than 100,000 acres ofthe critical old-growth forest is high-volume commercialtimber, according to the society's report. Arranging apurchase deal wouldn't be easy; but the payoff would be titleto a deed, not just another chance to fight the battle againnext year. Since the government is losing millions of dollarseach year on the Tongass anyway, it could, after selling theloggable land to the society, divert just two years of itssubsidy budget to buy out the mill owners and pay the workersgenerous severance pay, saving the taxpayer money from thenon.   The Nature Conservancy, which does take a market approach,just made a much larger purchase than the critical Tongassacreage, acquiring more than 300,000 acres in New Mexico fora price said to be between $16 million and $20 million. Thisis a lot of money, but, by obtaining title, the Conservancywill not have to persuade a continual string of Congresses tomanage the land as wilderness.   The Nature Conservancy has been using markets since 1951and now owns and manages nearly 2.6 million acres of landselected to preserve endangered wildlife or plants. Hundredsof other land trusts around the country are working quietly,with little fanfare, to protect land, usually through thepurchase or donation of land and conservation easements.Ducks Unlimited, for example, spends $30 million a year tolease or purchase conservation easements and to createwetlands.   Plenty of land is available for purchase by conservationgroups. Most wild areas are not attractive for commercialdevelopment. Brent Haglund, president of the Sand CountyFoundation in Madison, Wisc., says that wilderness-qualityareas in Wisconsin are available for between $100 and $200 anacre. &quot;I'd like to see some private groups secure parcels of5,000 acres, remove evidence of man's disturbance and createprivate wilderness tracts,&quot; he says. Indeed, Mr. Haglund'sSand County Foundation is re-creating a wilderness-like areaon its Leopold Reserve, the place in Wisconsin where environmentalist Aldo Leopold wrote his Sand County Al manac inthe 1930s and '40s. Out West, the Rocky Mountain ElkFoundation recently helped negotiate a purchase (most of itultimately paid for by government) of prime elk habitat thataveraged about $800 an acre.   Purchase is especially promising for tropical forests. Arecent study published in Nature magazine pointed out thattropical forestlands in Peru, now worth about $200 an acrewhen used for timber pro duction, could be worth far more iflocal people harvested fruits, latex and other indigenouscrops on a sustainable basis. A conservation organization, oreven a speculator in genetic resources, could buy the landand rent it to the local inhabitants. Indeed, part of itspayment to the government for title could be transferablepermits giving local people sustainable harvest rights.   Ecologist Norman Myers estimates that genetic resourcesrepresent a $40 billion market today in medical andpharmaceutical products. If he is correct, the acquisition ofunique, indigenous plant and animal genetic stocks offers thepossibility for great future reward. Roger Sedjo, aneconomist with Resources for the Future, says that holding apiece of tropical forest is &quot;like holding a lottery ticket&quot;-- one could be a big winner.   The World Wildlife Fund has already begun to use some ofits resources for &quot;debt-for-nature&quot; swaps, in which itpurchases a portion of a country's debt in return for thegovernment's promise to use the funds to protect tropicallands. The swaps are fraught with difficulties, WWF officialsconcede. It's time for the fund to try to take the morepermanent step of obtaining title to the land.   In sum, those who work for preservation should considerthe market as a mechanism. The result will be far greatersecurity of ownership, not a continual bill for lobbying thatis never marked &quot;paid.&quot;   ---   Mr. Stroup is an associate of the Political EconomyResearch Center in Bozeman, Mont.
