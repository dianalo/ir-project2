Milken, the father of the $125 billion junk bond market and the man often compared to J.P. Morgan, has turned his attention to the junkiest debt of all, that of troubled Latin American nations.    And the media blitz with which he has trumpeted his latest interest has led supporters and critics alike to wonder whether the normally secretive Mr. Milken is onto another bonanza to rival junk bonds, or merely generating a lot of favorable publicity to counter news that his business activities at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. are under federal investigation.    In the past several months, the financier has been trying to rally his network of influential and deep-pocketed clients, like manufacturers William Farley of Farley Industries Inc. and Roger Stone of Stone Container Corp., to invest in Latin American companies. Some investors also have been asked to build plants there, particularly in Mexico. While the investor group hasn't yet been formed, several investors say they are hot to jump on Mr. Milken's latest bandwagon. &quot;I wrote Mike and told him we'd be very hurt if he doesn't find a place for us,&quot; says William Friedman, vice chairman of Southmark Corp.    Mr. Milken jetted to Mexico this summer to talk about international debt with President Miguel de la Madrid. He's tried to interest Mexico and Venezuela in issuing bonds backed by oil and silver. And he's assembled a group of international debt experts at Drexel, including a six-man debt team the investment bank snared from Citicorp.    Yet despite all the fanfare, Mr. Milken -- who declined to be interviewed for this story -- has so far revealed largely conventional concepts and has yet to do a major transaction in Latin America. Right now, &quot;We're just moving the deck chairs around on the Titanic and trying to make some money on it,&quot; says a Drexel trader in Third World loans. Bankers often compare Third World debt talks to negotiating on the decks of the Titanic.    Indeed, some of Mr. Milken's otherwise loyal followers are in the skeptics' camp this time. &quot;He's coming off like an evangelist on this,&quot; says the chairman of one major U.S. corporation who was approached about setting up a factory in Mexico. Adds one of Mr. Milken's best clients, Latin America &quot;sounds like fun, it sounds like an adventure, but not with my money.&quot;    Competitors gripe that what they know of Mr. Milken's plans sounds like part old news and part pie in the sky. &quot;He's proposing what we've been proposing for years,&quot; says Pedro-Pablo Kuczynski, a managing director of First Boston Corp. and a former government minister in Peru. He calls Mr. Milken's Third World debt thrust &quot;good public relations.&quot;    As previously reported, Drexel is the subject of an intensive federal investigation stemming from the Ivan Boesky insider-trading scandal, and Mr. Milken, head of the firms's junk bond operations, is a major focus of that inquiry, people familiar with the investigation say. Both Drexel and Mr. Milken have denied any wrongdoing. Still, with the federal investigation hanging over Mr. Milken's head, his highly publicized involvement in the debt crisis strikes some critics and competitors as a masterful media campaign designed to portray him as a vital part of America's drive to resuscitate Latin America.    But whatever Mr. Milken is up to, Latin America itself has yet to take notice. &quot;How do you spell his name? Who is he?&quot; asks Jose Manuel Suarez Meir, a senior spokesman at Mexico's central bank.    Drexel's chief executive, Frederick H. Joseph, vehemently denies any attempt to use the firm's Latin American efforts as a publicity stunt. &quot;Yeah, that's why we started this four years ago, because we knew we'd need publicity today,&quot; he says. Mr. Joseph notes that Drexel bankers have been looking for new debt deals in Latin America for some time and that Drexel traders have been making markets in discounted Latin American debt.    Even skeptics admit it is unwise to take lightly the 41-year-old Mr. Milken, whose pioneering efforts made high-yield, high-risk junk bonds into a huge market and who helped launch a junk bond-financed takeover boom that has altered the way American industry looks and thinks. Richard L. Huber, a senior Citicorp executive, recently paid a call on the Drexel financier, noting that while Citicorp is loaded down with foreign debt, Mr. Milken is loaded with wealthy investors. &quot;We've got the stuff and (Mr. Milken's team has) got the stuffees,&quot; he jokes.    Mr. Milken's long-range plans in Latin America aren't clear in part because he's still thinking about them, and in part because what he tells prospective investors about his plans isn't always easy to follow. &quot;I sometimes wait until he leaves the room and then ask his associates&quot; what Mr. Milken meant, says Mr. Stone.    &quot;We've got some unique ideas, but I'm not going to tell you about them,&quot; says Mr. Joseph. In an interview, he plays down Drexel's Latin American ventures, saying, &quot;It's an interesting Randamp;D effort that could potentially be substantial, but it's too early to tell.&quot; Clients of Mr. Milken also caution that his Latin American efforts are in their infancy, but they clearly have high hopes. &quot;Back in 1979, junk bonds weren't all that big, if you know what I'm getting at,&quot; says Mr. Farley.    So far, proposals to securitize Latin American debt are mostly just talk. To date the only significant markets to grow out of the international debt crisis are the small but growing trade in heavily discounted Latin American loans and the linked business of swapping debt for equity investments in the borrowing countries. These markets altogether amount to a few billion dollars of transactions a year, against hundreds of billions of outstanding Third World bank debts.    Proposals to securitize Latin American bank debt usually involve banks exchanging their shaky loans for bonds, which would reflect the present secondary market value of the banks' credits. But bankers wonder what bank would exchange a loan it can keep on its books at full face value -- and on which it often is receiving full interest -- for bonds which are worth much less.    But despite such uncertainties, Drexel is putting its considerable marketing talent to work behind its Third World debt effort. Drexel investment bankers -- minus Mr. Milken -- were highly visible at a recent conference on international debt in Vienna, which the firm co-sponsored. The bankers, government officials and journalists there lunched on Drexel's smoked trout mousse, Viennese-style beef and grape strudel in the sumptuous hallway of Vienna's Palais Ferstel, and then the firm gave each of them a souvenir clock that simultaneously tells the time in London, Tokyo and New York.    Clients say Mr. Milken's interest in Latin America is an outgrowth of his view of the world, which he has been increasingly anxious to share with them. When Mr. Farley flew out to Beverly Hills (where Mr. Milken runs Drexel's junk bond operations) to discuss a &quot;megabucks&quot; financing Mr. Milken is handling for him, Mr. Milken quickly moved the subject to the global economy. &quot;He said, 'Bill, let me run some thoughts by you,'&quot; Mr. Farley recalls. The two men proceeded to talk for an hour &quot;about the world -- conceptually,&quot; he says.    &quot;We talked about Europe, Asia, Africa, Russia, Latin America. We went around the world and said, 'Who controls what?'&quot; says Mr. Farley. &quot;That's how we got into this Latin America thing: It's up for grabs.&quot;    According to Mr. Farley, Mr. Milken told him that Europe is a &quot;standoff&quot; because U.S., Japanese and European interests are established there. Asia isn't promising, Mr. Milken said, because &quot;the Japanese have a natural advantage there.&quot; &quot;No one will do business in Russia,&quot; Mr. Milken said, according to Mr. Farley.    Latin America is Mr. Milken's area of choice because the U.S. has historic ties there, clients say. They say Mr. Milken argues that recent moves by U.S. banks to increase their loan-loss reserves for Latin debt and to pull back from Latin America creates a void that will be filled -- either by U.S. entrepreneurs, like himself, or by others, such as the Japanese.    According to Mr. Milken's clients and Drexel officials, Mr. Milken appears to have two main thrusts to his Latin American plan that strike them as particularly promising.    The most ambitious plan is to raise money from a group of investors to buy chunks of Latin American debt that could then be swapped for equity stakes in Latin American businesses. &quot;The ultimate objective here is to create a market mechanism where there are a number of people developing projects with Latin American businessmen who compete for conversion of debt to equity opportunities,&quot; says Southmark's Mr. Friedman.    The initial target for the fund, says Drexel's Mr. Joseph, is about $100 million to $150 million, with about 30 investors putting up $5 million each. The relatively small initial fund, according to those who have talked to Mr. Milken, is intended as a test of the concept. &quot;I think his goal is to put his foot in the water, make some money, and figure out if there's a better way,&quot; says Mr. Farley.    While the group has yet to be formalized, Mr. Farley has little doubt about its potential. &quot;You're talking about, I think, some of the best business people in the country,&quot; he says.    Still, debt professionals say such a group faces stiff obstacles. American Express Co. has spent months trying to set up a similar debt-equity fund to invest in Filipino debt. But American Express Co. Executive Vice President Harry Freeman says the company has run into formidable accounting problems involving how to value discounted debt at different stages of a transaction. Those knowledgeable about debt transactions say several other banks and financial institutions, including Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., Citicorp and Bankers Trust New York Corp., currently are more active in Latin American debt-equity swaps than Drexel.    What's more, many Latin American countries have been wary of debt-equity swaps, fearing that the result will be heavy foreign ownership of their assets. And at least one of Mr. Milken's most loyal junk bond investors says he's afraid to get involved in Latin America. &quot;None of these countries is stable,&quot; he says.    Mr. Milken's other effort is trying to persuade heavily-indebted countries like Mexico and Venezuela to pledge their best assets -- like oil and silver -- to back new bonds that would be sold by Drexel. &quot;Venezuela could borrow in the capital markets at reasonable rates with an oil-linked bond that carried a supra-national (international) guarantee,&quot; Hani Findakly, a Drexel senior vice president and debt expert, told the recent Vienna conference.    But several other U.S. investment bankers active in the region have tried unsuccessfully to suggest similar schemes in the past few years. Some members of Mr. Milken's staff met briefly in the U.S. with Venezuela's chief debt negotiator, Jorge Marcano, but the Venezuelans apparently aren't interested in a bond issue that would require them to pledge their oil. &quot;I think it's a public relations exercise, because no self-respecting country is going to pledge its best assets,&quot; George Soros, a New York-based financier who runs his own multibillion-dollar investment fund, says of Drexel's Vienna presentation.    Mr. Milken has said he would be spending as much as 25% of his time on the Latin American project, but made clear it could be less. Drexel has also added others to bolster its Latin American expertise. However, one hiring -- of an officer no longer with the firm -- it would like to forget. Two years ago, the firm took on a senior Latin American banker, Antonio Gebauer, from J.P. Morgan andamp; Co. Mr. Gebauer, however, quit Drexel last year and later pleaded guilty to bank fraud and tax evasion in connection with unauthorized withdrawals of several million dollars from customers' accounts at Morgan.    ---                  Prices for LDC Bank Loans                                               % CHANGE IN                            BID      OFFER        BID FROM                        AUG. 10    AUG. 10          MAY 18 Argentina               $45.50     $48.00         - 23.5% Brazil                   46.00      48.00         - 27.0 Chile                    65.00      66.50         -  7.8 Costa Rica               33.00      36.00         -  5.7 Ecuador                  36.00      40.00         - 30.8 Mexico                   50.50      51.50         - 13.3 Venezuela                64.00      66.00         - 11.7   Source: Salomon Brothers Inc.</TEXT></DOC>
