The main elements of the approach to the IAEA safeguardsimplementation for the given facility, including the IAEA control aims,requirements to the organization of the system of nuclear material accountand control at NPP with WWER-1000, are considered. Taking into accountpeculiarities of design and operation of the facility, possible waysof nuclear material diversion are analyzed. Technical means and devicesnecessary for the control procedure realization both in possession ofIAEA and developed for the purposes in the framework of the USSR researchand development support program for the IAEA safeguards are considered.Recommendations are made on possible IAEA safeguards procedures for NPPwith WWER-1000, developed taking into account peculiarities of the facilityconsidered, approach to safeguards implementation and technical meansof control recommended for utilization. Labour consumption for the implementationof the IAEA inspection activities at the facility is assessed. Technicalrecommendations for the account of the IAEA safeguards procedure requirementsto the design of NPP with WWER-1000 are given so as to increase the efficiencyof the IAEA control measures. 28 refs.; 14 figs.; 6 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
