The House voted 247-130 to approve the measure. Under theprocedure used, however, two-thirds of those voting had to be infavor of the legislation for passage, and the House failed to reachthat margin by five votes.   Even if the House had approved the bill, there was little chancefor passage by the Senate, which hasn't considered such legislation.   The Federal Assets Disposition Administration, a quasi-publicorganization, was formed by the Federal Home Loan Bank in 1985 toassist the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. in themanagement and disposition of acquired assets.   Lawmakers have accused it of favoritism, conflicts of interestand mismanagement of the $3.9 billion in loans and real estate inits care.   FADA was criticized bitterly for paying salaries as high as$250,000 annually, cloaking its activities in secret and failing todispose of many of the assets placed in its custody.   The House Banking Committee approved the bill on Oct. 4 by avote of 42-8, with all the negative votes coming from Republicanswho see the legislation as a political measure rather thansubstantive action.   The legislation would have given the bank board 60 days to closeFADA and limit severence pay for employees to about $4,700, orthree weeks' salary, rather than the four months' pay pledged bythe agency early this year.   The bill, similar to a section of the omnibus bankinglegislation approved by the House in August, would have assignedFADA's activities to FSLIC, the government insurance fund thatbacks Sandamp;L deposits up to $100,000.   Reps. Paul Kanjorski, D-Pa., and Tom McMillen, D-Md., introducedthe legislation.   Rep. Fernand J. St Germain, D-R.I., Banking Committee chairmanand floor manager for the bill, said in debate that his panel hadbeen investigating FADA for the past 15 months.   ``Our findings clearly establish that this agency has become awasteful bureaucracy, lacing in accountability, and providing aninefficient means of disposing of property acquired from failedsavings and loan associations,'' he said.   ``High salaries, big expense accounts and CIA-like secrecy havebecome the agency's claims to fame during its three-yearexistence.''</TEXT></DOC>
