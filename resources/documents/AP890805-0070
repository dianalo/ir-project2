The accord, signed Friday after 22 hours of talks between theleftist government and 20 opposition parties, also calls fordisbanding the U.S.-backed Contra rebel force.   President Daniel Ortega and his counterparts from Honduras, ElSalvador, Guatemala and Costa Rica will discuss the demobilizationthis weekend at a summit meeting in Honduras.   ``The accord reflects the common will to contribute toward thepeace process at the summit,'' said Jaime Bonilla of theIndependent Liberal Party, speaking for a coalition of 14 of the 20parties.   He said that ``even though the opposition is not completelysatisfied, the electoral process is being channeled toward what theopposition wants.''   The government promised to put no restraints on campaigning ornews coverage. It also agreed to suspend the unpopular militarydraft from September until after the election, scheduled for Feb.25.   The Sandinistas began compulsory military service for all menaged 17 to 25 in 1983, two years after their war with the Contrasbegan.   A cease-fire has been in place since last spring, when U.S.military aid to the rebels ended and the Contras began retreatingto Honduran base camps. About 11,000 rebels and their families arenow living in the camps near the Nicaraguan border.   The pact is a ``positive base for democratization,'' AlbertoSaborio of the opposition National Conservative Party told a newsconference Friday.   Emilio Alvarez Montalvan, another conservative leader, said theaccord will enable the opposition ``to keep demanding democraticguarantees from the Sandinista regime and to continue itsstruggle.''   Luis Sanchez of the Nicaraguan Socialist Party called the pact``an important political step'' but said it had not resolvedlingering questions about the legal status of oppositon alliances.   The Sandinistas sought the talks after complaints by oppositionleaders that their candidates were harassed in earlier elections,their movements constrained and their exposure to the publicrestricted by news censorship.   The accord also calls for a halt to undercover activities duringthe campaign and promises unconditional amnesty to all politicalprisoners, including 1,605 rebels in Nicaraguan jails.   The Sandinistas have been in power since a 1979 revolution thattoppled the Somoza family dictatorship.   The United States began supporting the Contras in 1982 andimposed an economic embargo on Nicaragua three years later, arguingthat Sandinista efforts to impose a leftist government and theirclose military ties with Moscow and Havana threatened security inCentral America.   ``I hope the U.S. government will respect this sovereigndecision of the Nicaraguan people and change U.S. policy towardNicaragua, and that it puts an end to the (1985) economicembargo,'' Ortega said after signing the accord Friday.</TEXT></DOC>
