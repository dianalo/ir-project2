<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-26-0668 </DOCNO><TEXT>A liquid-core optical waveguide (OWG) sensor of ionizing radiation canbe used for dosimetry over broad absorbed-dose ranges, by means of arelatively simple experimental arrangement. The analyzing visible lightfrom one of several narrow wavelength-band sources at the proximal endof the OWG is propagated efficiently through a tightly coiled waveguidecontaining a radiochromic solution. This solution constitutes the sensorand attenuates the measuring light according to the simple Beer-Lambertrelationship, where increases in the optical absorbance, measured photometricallyat the distal end of the OWG, are proportional to the concentrationsof the radiation-induced absorbing species (dye molecules), which inturn are proportional to the absorbed dose in the sensor. When the analyzinglight is of broad spectral distribution, the absorbance vs dose relationshipbecomes sublinear. The apparatus may be adapted either to the spectrophotometricmeasurement of absorbed dose rate or integrated absorbed dose duringgamma radiolysis or to dosimetry in the pulse radiolysis or flash photolysisof radiation-stimulated chromophores. The OWG principle works with anytransparent liquid or gel sensor held as the core material of a flexibleplastic tubing, whose refractive index is less than that of the light-propagatingcore.</TEXT></DOC>
