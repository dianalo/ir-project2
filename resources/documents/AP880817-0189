(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The United States exploded a nucleardevice Wednesday as Soviet scientists exercised their right towatch under a treaty allowing the superpowers to monitor eachother's tests.   Dust rose and the desert rippled at ground zero as the test,code-named Kearsarge, exploded 2,012 feet under the mesa at 10 a.m.PDT.   U.S. and Soviet diplomats, scientists and military officials inthe top-secret Nevada Test Site control center, 30 miles away, sawthe surface effects on television monitors but did not feel groundmotion.   Thirty seconds after detonation, Viktor Mikhailov, leader of theSoviet technical team, took a telephone call and raised his righthand with an OK signal, indicating the Soviets had received thedata they were seeking. The signal was greeted with applause.   Nick Aquilina, manager of the Nevada Operations Office, whichconducts the U.S. nuclear testing program, smiled and shook handswith scientists.   ``Everything appears successful so far,'' he told reporterslater.   James Magruder, the U.S. test controller, called it a``resounding success.''   Observers included diplomats who helped forge the agreement inGeneva last year: Igor Palenykh, head of the Soviet delegation tothe talks; his deputy, Gen. Sergei Zelentsov, deputy head of theSoviet delegation; and U.S. Ambassador C. Paul Robinson.   The test was ``a step down the road to a more stable world,''Robinson said. ``How far we go depends on what we negotiate on theweapons themselves. I hope we can take the process to the pointwhere there is no need for weapons at all.''   Palenykh told reporters before the test that the Soviet Union'sgoal is a ban on testing.   ``As far as the Soviet Union is concerned we are prepared at anytime to cease nuclear testing along with the United States,''Palenykh said through an interpreter.   The $25 million test was designed to determine the ability ofeach country to accurately measure the other's nuclear tests inorder to preventing cheating on treaties signed in 1974 and 1976limiting the size of tests to 150 kilotons.   Both sides have accused the other of exceeding the limits.   The Soviet Union had 45 nuclear scientists, engineers anddiplomats on hand. A similar number of American scientists will beon hand for a Soviet test at the Russian site at Semipalatinsk onSept. 14.   U.S. and Soviet scientists monitored the test with equipmentplaced in trailers a few hundred yards from ground zero. Thetrailers were unmanned at the time of detonation.   The trailer areas are fenced and armed guards check thoseentering and leaving. Signs on the fences state: ``Security Area:Deadly Force Authorized.''   Americans may enter the Soviets' trailer area at the Soviets'invitation.   President Reagan first suggested such a verification test in aUnited Nations speech four years ago. The tests were finally agreedto by Reagan and General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev at theWashington summit in December.   Soviet scientists were at the Nevada Test Site when six testswere conducted earlier this year, but Kearsarge was the first eventin which they were involved.   The test was the ninth conducted at the site this year and the684th announced shot there since 1951.   Systems to measure the size of an explosion are considered a keyin ratifying the 1974 Threshold Test Ban Treaty and the 1976Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty. Both pacts limit nuclear teststo 150 kilotons and both sides have accused the other of exceedingthose limits.   The superpowers are testing their own systems to measure thesize of the tests. The U.S. uses a system called CORRTEX(Continuous Reflectometry for Radius Versus Time Experiment) whichmeasures the speed of the underground shock wave. The Soviets usesimilar systems to see if they obtain the same data.   The Nevada Test Site has been the scene of large anti-nuclearprotests but only about 20 anti-nuclear protesters were presentwhen reporters entered the facility's gates. One protester sat downin front of a bus but was quickly dragged to the side of the road.</TEXT></DOC>
