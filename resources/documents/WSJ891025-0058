The Oakland grocery retailer, closely held since a $4.2 billion leveraged buy-out in 1986, said profit for the three months ended Sept. 9 was $7.1 million, compared with $23 million a year earlier. But it said the year-earlier results included gains of $23.5 million from divestitures.    Sales rose 4.2% to $3.31 billion from $3.2 billion.    For the nine months, the company said profit fell 49% to $23.5 million from $46 million in the year-earlier quarter, which included divestiture-related gains of $50.6 million. Sales increased 5.5% to $9.81 billion from $9.3 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
