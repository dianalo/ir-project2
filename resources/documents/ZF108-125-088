 Unfortunately, today'snetwork is much slower than today's system bus.andP;  A VME bus operates at 40MBper second, while Ethernet is rated at 10Mbps, and even a 16Mbps IBMToken-Ring looks sluggish by comparison.andM;The most obvious solution is to move to a highspeed backbone network, whichwill provide greater bandwidth for the increasing amounts of data thatnetworks are required to transmit.andP;  Proprietary networks that provide as muchas 100Mbps--a tenfold increase over Ethernet speed--are currently available.andO;But the industry's best hope continues to be the development of backbonenetworks based on the Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI), which is the100Mbps ANSI standard for data-only fiber-optic networks.andM;Unfortunately for users, however, both FDDI-compliant and proprietarysolutions are going to be prohibitively expensive in the near term unless,for example, a site has already run out of bandwidth and needs to install a100Mbps backbone immediately to avert a total network catastrophe.andM;Bridges and routers priced anywhere from $7,000 to $12,000 when linkingEthernet networks cost about twice as much when linking those same Ethernetsto a 100Mbps backbone.andM;The fiber-optic cable these networks require is also much more expensive thanthe coaxial cable connecting Ethernets, and requires costly opticalconnectors.andP;  These added expenses put today's highspeed backbone networkbeyond the fiscal reach of most companies.andM;Consequently, the most cost-effective strategy while waiting for prices todrop on 100Mbps FDDI networks is to continue relying on Ethernet as thebackbone network, and maintain reasonable response times on LAN's by creatingsubnetworks using bridges and routers.andM;At the same time, network managers should begin mapping a strategy fortomorrow that includes FDDI as the network's backbone.andM;New buildings should include fiber-optic cable among the wiring closets, andnew cable between buildings should also be fiber-optic.andP;  Then, whenhigh-speed fiber backbone networks drop to more reasonable prices, thenetwork can jump in speed simply by adding the hardware.andM;FIBER ETHERNET VS.andP;  FDDIandM;For example, a simple backbone network linking four Ethernet LANs over atwo-mile span will have a widely varying cost, depending on whether thebackbone itself is Ethernet or if an FDDI backbone is being used.andM;For a 10Mbps fiber-optic Ethernet, the backnone network will require fourbridges at $10,000 each, including the transceivers necessary to switch fromwire cable to optical cable.andP;  In addition to the bridges, the network willuse the same fiber-optic cable that the FDDI option would require.andP;  At $1.45per foot, this comes to about $15,300.andP;  Cable installation costsapproximately $80 per hour, and 600 feet of cable can be laid in one man-day.andO;Thus, installation costs are $11,300.andM;In comparison, the FDDI installation would require four Ethernet-to-FDDIbridges at $27,000 each, for total cost of $108,000.andP;  Cabling andinstallation costs would be the same, so the cost of installing FDDI would be$68,000 greater than the cost of a fiber-optic Ethernet backbone.andM;What you get for that $68,000 is greater bandwidth.andP;  But to justify such anexpense now, most network managers would have to demonstrate a clear andimmediate network crisis that would be ameliorated by the extra bandwidth.andM;In five years, however, FDDI hardware is expected to cost about the same asEthernet hardware.andP;  Thus, by installing fiber-optic cable now and waiting forprices of FDDI to drop, a network manager can move to a theoretical tenfoldincrease in bandwidth for the cost of replacing the network's currentEthernet hardware.andM;On the other hand, a network manager who opts to continue relying on coaxialcable for his Ethernet backbone would save money today, but would face muchhigher costs to upgrade the network to FDDI in the future.andM;The same Ethernet backbone using coaxial cable would require four bridges at$9,500 each; cable would cost only about $1,000, and the installation costwould be about the same.andM;But in five years, the manager would have to recable wtih fiber optics, aswell as add the FDDI hardware.andP;  The price of cable is not expected to dropsubstantially; the cost of installation, however, is likely to rise at about5 percent per year, bringing installation costs to about $13,735--on top ofthe $11,300 to have the coaxial cable installed in the first place.andM;Thus, the manager who intalls a fiber-optic Ethernet now will end up wtih100Mbps capability at the least cost in the long run.andM;Eventually, just about every major computer site will have to look forgreater network bandwidths.andP;  Chief among the factors influencing this need isthe growing number of departmental LANs requiring interconnection.andM;In many organizations, different work areas have implemented different LANsaccording to their specific needs.andP;  Engineering departments may have equippedtheir staffs with workstation linked to servers or VAXes through a variety ofEthernet implementation such as DECnet or TCP/IP.andP;  Other offices anddepartments may have IBM's Token-Ring, PC-based Ethernets on AppleTalk.andM;Not surprisingly, many of these user groups want to share data with oneanother.andM;The network vendors, through gateways, bridges and routers, have providedways to link one network to another.andP;  But while these bridges provide the on-and off-ramps to the backbone data highway, that highway itself is littlemore than a two-lane road.andM;The more individual networks that join the backbone, the more traffic thatneeds to get on the road.andP;  The result can resemble a Los Angeles freeway atrush hour.andM;SIGNS OF OVERLOADandM;The struggle to keep bandwidth ahead of utilization will be compounded by theincreased use of technologies such as client/Server computing anddistributing databases.andM;Other forces increasing the demand on network bandwidths are image processingand electronic publishing applications.andP;  The large data files--anywhere from10MB to 50MB--that these applications produce could choke the averageEthernet.andP;  Thus, passing images or CAD designs from one server to another orfrom server to workstation becomes a long, arduous task and means an unhappyuser on the waiting end.andM;There are many signs to indicate the clear need for a high-speed backbonenetwork.andP;  For an existing backbone, traffic statistics may be the bestmeasure of network demand.andM;With Ethernet as well as other CSMA/CD networks, the number of packetsreceived is proportional to the number of packets sent as long as the trafficon the network remains below a certain level.andP;  Network use should neverexceed 80 percent of capacity; users should expect performance drop-offs whenutilization rises above that level.andP;  Since CSMA/CD networks use randomlytimed retransmissions to recover from packet collisions, their performancewill be difficult to predict.andM;One obvious way to reduce traffic on the network is to split it intosubnetworks.andP;  However, this will not always provide a performance gain, andwith some Ethernet implementations, such as DECnet, efficient subnet designscan be tricky to establish.andM;In fact, with any bus network, the subdivision can cause more problems thanit solves.andP;  Unless the subdivision is made carefully, some applications mayhave to proceed through more than one router or bridge to access the datathey require.andP;  The more hardware that stands between a message's source anddestination, the slower the overall response.andM;Even with the most careful network redesign, planners may be unable toeliminate the two-hop requirement, thus forcing MIS either to accept existingperformance levels or move to a highspeed backbone.andM;Another reason for adopting a faster network could be the introduction of newapplications.andP;  Most often, imaging, electronic publishing, and CAD or CAEapplications are the culprits behind increased bandwidth requirements.andM;While FDDI promises a network that can handle the demands of theseapplications, even it does not always achieve its 100Mbps potential.andP;  Likeany other system, FDDI has some bottlenecks, and these reside in theLAN-to-FDDI bridges.andM;BRIDGING THE GAPandM;Implementing an FDDI backbone requires, first of all, bridges between FDDIand the slower subnets.andP;  How these bridge complete the link between the twonetworks can affect performance drastically.andM;There are two methods of bridging dissimilar networks.andP;  Encapsulation is thetechnique used in most bridges on the market but, unfortunately, is the leastdesirable means of connection.andP;  An encapsulating bridge simply takes thesource packet from the subnetwork and wraps it in an FDDI packet with theaddress of the bridges that will be transmitting that packet.andM;There are no encapsulation standards.andP;  Bridges of this type all useproprietary processes and architectures such that the encapsulating bridgesfrom one vendor cannot communicate with bridges from another vendor.andM;A second problem with encapsulating bridges is that they cannot supportbackbone hosts because all address information is lost until the packet isunencapsulated by another bridge.andM;Transparent bridges, on the other hand, translate and reformat the sourcepacket into an FDDI packet, retaining the original source and destinationaddresses.andP;  This avoids the problems created by encapsulating bridges,allowing subnetwork-to-backbone host communications as well as unifiednetwork management.andM;But even with transparent bridges, performance can be a problem.andP;  If thebridge creates a bottleneck, the effective speed of the backbone networkcould be limited to a fraction of its full capacity.andM;This is why: A 100Mbps backbone can handle 500,000 packets per second, and anEthernet network is capable of transmitting 14,800 packets per second.andP;  Abridge has to filter every packet--on both sides--to establish which packetsit must pass to the other network.andM;If a bridge cannot keep up with the packets passing on both sides, it eitherforces retransmissions or passes the packets to all subnets, loading thosenetworks with unnecessary traffic and degrading network performance.andP;  Inshort, the bridge performance will define user perception of overall networkthroughput.andM;You can bet that high-performance bridges will not be cheap.andP;  FDDI, like anynew technology, is expensive for a variety of reasons.andM;The reasons behind these high costs are manifold, and in part are directlyattributable to the FDDI standard itself.andM;If a site installs fiber-optic cable today in preparation for FDDI networkingtomorrow, it is crucial that the fiber cable be able to support the dual-ringtoken-passing protocol architecture required by the FDDI standard.andM;At the physical media layer, the FDDI standard requires fiber-optic cablingwith a 62.5-micron glass diameter and 125-micron diameter cladding, andtransmission at a wavelength of 1300 nanometers (nm).andP;  The frequencyrequirement has some important cost ramifications and drives up the cost ofinterface boards substantially.andM;While the light-emitting diodes (LEDs) for a fiber-optic Ethernet interfacerunning at 850nm cost the manufacturer only $25 to $30, a pair ofFDDI-standard LEDs runs about $200--a tenfold increase that is reflected inmuch higher-prices for the end user.andM;A second reason for such high end-user purchase prices is that only onemanufacturer is currently shipping FDDI chip sets.andP;  Several othe r chipmanufacturers, however, including Motorola and National Semiconductor, haveannounced chip sets that will be available within the next couple of years.andM;As more FDDI suppliers come on line, competition is expected to lower pricesdramatically, bringing FDDI's costs in line with Ethernet's by the middle ofthis decade.andM;BREAKING EVEN TODAYandM;But in the meantime, how is the cost of a high-speed backbone justified todayif a company's network is already out of bandwidth?andM;One case in which the cost of installing FDDI is outweighted by the savingsoccurs when multiple subnetworks are needed on the system.andP;  Although FDDI hasthe capacity of 10 Ethernet networks, it does not cost 10 times as much.andO;Thus, if the addition of the backbone can eliminate the need for morecomputing equipment, you may be ahead of the game.andM;For example, the need to limit the number of workstations on a subnetwork forreasons of both performance and reliability forces many corporate networks tobranch hierarchically.andP;  Traffic on any segment of the network is kept withinmanageable bounds, and a media failure does not affect large numbers ofusers.andM;This design, however, requires that multiple servers be placed throughout thenetwork in order to provide rapid access to applications and data.andP;  The sameapplications must reside on multiple servers, and data may have to beduplicated as well.andP;  Such a structure also complicates network administrationbecause failures or malfunctions often cannot be located easily or quickly.andM;A high-speed backbone, on the othe rhand, would permit use of a single-tierednetwork above the Ethernet LANs.andP;  The high-speed backbone immediatelyflattens the hierarchy of gateways, improving the performance for data thatpreviously had to move across multiple gateways and eliminating the need forseveral Ethernet routers.andP;  Because the cost of an FDDI bridge is equivalentto about two Ethernet routers, any addition of FDDI that eliminates at leastthree Ethernet routers becomes cost-effective.andM;STANDARDSandM;Unlike the LAN scene, which in its early years resembled the shootout at theO.K.andP;  Corral, with vendors vying for de facto standard status, the backbonenetwork already has a standard to call its own, although several vendors alsosupply proprietary backbone networks.andM;FDDI calls for a 100Mbps dualring token-passing network that can support asmany as 500 nodes with as much as 2 kilometers (km) between each node.andO;However, there is a maximum ring perimeter of 100km, and as the number ofconnections and splices on the network increases, the maximum allowabledistance decreases.andM;It is easy to claim, based on rated speeds, that FDDI theoretically providesa tenfold performance increase over Ethernet.andP;  Not surprisingly, however,pure sped must be considered in conjunction with other, real-world factors.andM;In the foreseeable future, FDDI will not replace Ethernet LANs.andP;  But it willreplace Ethernet as an overall network backbone, and in that capacity offerseveral advantages.andP;  The dual-ring topology offers some degree offault-tolerance by providing a backup ring.andP;  The nodes on either side of abreak in the main ring can reconfigure to pass tokens across to the secondring, ensuring that the network is not segmented by a single break.andM;FDDI also makes better use of available bandwidth than does Ethernet.andP;  Forexample, if network performance is defined as the product of the maximumsize, maximum number of stations and the peak data rate of the network, FDDIcomes out far ahead of the competition.andP;  For FDDI, this measurement, calledthe P-factor, is 5 x [10.sup.12] station kilometer bits per second.andP;  Incomparison, the P-factor for an IEEE 802.3 Ethernet network is only[10.sup.10].andM;Token-passing networks life FDDI also avoid the performance degradation thatCSMA/CD networks suffer a high traffic levels.andP;  Data throughput exceeding 90andamp;ercent of the single-user maximum capacity can be achieved with the FDDItoken-passing method.andM;Although FDDI is a token-passing network, and each station on the networkregenerates and retransmits every token it receives, FDDI does not use thesame token-passing scheme outlined by the IEEE 802.5 token-ring standard.andM;FDDI uses a Timed Token Rotation protocol.andP;  Under this protocol, each stationtracks the time that has elapsed since the last token was received.andP;  Byvarying the target token rotation time, the network may be optimized fordifferent types of performance.andP;  For example, a low target rotation time,such as 4 milliseconds (ms), may be established.andP;  This, in turn, guarantees aworst-case response time of 8ms, which is the time it would take two tokensto rotate around the entire ring.andP;  Real-time applications such as OLTPbenefit from this predictably fast response time.andM;On the other hand, establishing a higher target token rotation time willpermit very high network utilization under heavy loads.andP;  For example, anetwork may have 75 stations strung along a 30km ring, which results in aring latency of 0.25ms.andP;  Combined with a lengthy target token rotation timelike 50ms, 99.5 percent of the network bandwidth may be utilized, which mightbe more effective for shipping massive files across the network.andM;FDDI also uses a different data encoding technique than most other protocols.andM;Ethernet and other protocols use the Manchester encoding method, whichrequires two state changes (or baud) to represent 1 bit.andM;FDDI uses another, more compressed scheme that requires 5 band to represent 4bits.andP;  Without such compression, the FDDI network would require a clock rateof 200MHz to carry the same amount of data as its 125MHz allows.andM;In comparison, some of the proprietary high-speed backbone networks use adifferent encoding scheme that is somewhat less efficient.andP;  Therefore,although the physical specifications of such networks are roughly the same asfor an FDDI network, the net result is a lower data throughput rate.andM;Finally, FDDI is less prone to retransmissions than Ethernet.andM;In a real-world test using FDDI to connect two campus Ethernet networks, FDDIproved to have one-fifth the error rate of an Ethernet connection in the samerole.andP;  During this five-month experiment, Ethernet's receive error rate was 1packet in 10,000; FDDI's receive error rate was only 1 packet in 1 million.andM;IN THE FUTUREandM;FDDI appears to possess a hold on the near future, but products for thistechnology have only just begun to appear.andM;DEC has begun supporting the FDDI standard as part of its DECconnect system,signing deals last falls with two chip manufacturers to supply DEC withcustom-made FDDI chip sets.andM;Market research companies are predicting a bright future for FDDI.andP;  Accordingto San Jose, Calif.'s Dataquest, the number of FDDI chip-set shipments willgrow from 1,200 in 1989 to 340,000 by 1993.andM;Revenues will increase by 181 percent annually to a projected $680 million by1993, indicating that the price of these components, one of the major factorskeeping FDDI networks expensive, will drop substantially.andM;Figures from International Data Corp. in Framingham, Mass., indicate thatrevenues for backbone FDDI networks will grow at an average of 138 percentper year over the next five years.andM;The move to an FDDI network or a proprietary network with future FDDIcompatibility will not guarantee further upward compatibility.andP;  There are atleast two networking systems under development that could, in the nextdecade, become the foundation for computing in the 21st century.andM;Meanwhile, the committee responsible for developing the FDDI standard hasalready begun working on FDDI-2, and has completed much of the work requiredto establish its specifications.andM;Unlike the data-only FDDI, FDDI-2 will provide multiple services, includingvideo and voice, on the same network.andM;But as applications continue to become more complicated, and ascomputer-generated information takes increasingly diverse forms, networkmanagers can rely on just one truism: Like CPUs and MIPs, there is neverenough bandwidth.andM;Network backbone users turn to FDDIandM;Manufacturing was the largest industry group represented in the DR StrategiesFiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) survey of VAX sites with a backbonenetwork in place.andP;  An experienced group, the manufacturers tended to be largecompanies, and nearly half indicated that their present backbone network hadbeen up and running for more than 36 months.andP;  More than 25 percent had 200nodes or more on the network and used more than 25 bridges or routers.andP;  Morethan 30 percent of the manufacturers indicated they have spent more than $1million on their present backbone solution.andM;Although the manufacturers agreed on many issues--more than 91 percent usedDECnet on their LANs--they were split over the future of FDDI.andP;  Sixty-fivepercent now use fiber optics on their network backbone, but more than 60percent said they have no plans to implement FDDI.andM;FDDI, even among the total group of respondents, seemed to be receivedunevenly.andP;  Among the backbone users in the subgroup without plans toimplement FDDI, nearly 50 percent indicated the major reason was that theydidn't know enough about it.andP;  Others cited cost, flexibility and reliabilityas issues.andM;Two percent of those polled already use a version of FDDI, but nearly 66percent were running TCP/IP or some version of Ethermet over fiber optics.andO;Twenty percent of the total respondents indicated they don't plan toimplement FDDI for at least two years.andP;  Eighteen percent said they willimplement FDDI in the next 12 to 24 months.andM;The VAX sites were selected randomly from a list provided by ComputerIntelligence, a market research company in La Jolla, Calif., and compiled byBeta Research of Syosett, N.Y.andP;  Participants were asked if they were using orplanning to implement a fiber-optic backbone at their site.andP;  More than 67percent of the respondents are now using a fiber-optic backbone, 26 percentsaid they were planning to implement one and 7 percent said they wereconsidering it.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
