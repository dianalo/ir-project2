President Elias Hrawi said he would ask Syria to withdraw the40,000 soldiers it stations in Lebanon if his new government canestablish authority over a nation factionalized by 14 years ofsectarian civil war.   Police said 20 people were wounded in fighting between theSyrian-backed Shiite militia Amal and the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, orParty of God, in Beirut and south Lebanon.   Four warplanes attacked Palestinian bases near Sidon, provincialcapital of south Lebanon, in Israel's 17th air raid into Lebanonthis year. Police said seven people were wounded.   The South Lebanon Army, a predominantly Christian militia thathelps Israel patrol its border ``security zone'' in south Lebanon,shelled the Shiite market town of Nabatiyeh and nearby Hadathavillage with 155mm howitzers. Eleven people were reported wounded.   Police said the Israeli planes hit bases used by guerrillas ofterrorist Abu Nidal and the Syrian-backed Palestine LiberationFront on the northern edge of the Majdalioun Valley, east of Sidon.   A clinic operated by the Soviet-backed Democratic Front for theLiberation of Palestine also was damaged in the raid at 11:45 a.m.,police reported.   South Lebanon Army opened fire on Nabatiyeh and Hadatha a fewminutes later.   Police said 20 shells landed in Hadatha, eight miles north ofthe border with Israel, wounding 10 civilians. Hadatha is policedby Nepalese units of the 5,800-member U.N. Interim Force inLebanon, to which nine nations contribute soldiers.   Militia gunners also fired intermittently at Nabatiyeh and thesurrounding area, wounding a woman, said a police spokesman, whosename was withheld because of regulations.   Funeral processions for five people killed in similar shellingMonday were blocked by the shelling. Ambulances carrying the bodiescould not enter Kfar Rumman village on Nabatiyeh's northern edge.   ``They waited all day,'' the police spokesman said, and``finally, the victims were buried in Deir Zahrani,'' six miles tothe west.   Security sources in south Lebanon said Hezbollah fightersresponded to the shelling by firing four rockets into Marjayoun, aChristian border town where the Israeli-allied militia has itsheadquarters.   Lebanon protested the shelling to the U.N. Security Council,blaming the attacks on Israel, the Foreign Ministry said.   Amal, which lost control of Sohmor, Yohmor and Mashgara villagesin the Bekaa Valley to Hezbollah in overnight fighting, wasregrouping, apparently for a counterattack.   Syrian soldiers police the valley in east Lebanon. They stayedout of the battle, but scores were deployed Tuesday at an Amal baseat the northern entrance to Mashgara.   According to the police spokesman, Amal ``has lost all itspositions in the western sector of the Bekaa.''   Two civilians were slightly wounded by shrapnel duringskirmishes in Christian east Beirut between Syrian-backed militiasand the Christian troops of Gen. Michel Aoun, who fought asix-month artillery war with Syrian troops this year.   Shooting across the no man's land between east Beirut and theMoslem western sector panicked residents of the capital, who fearthe political crisis between the Hrawi and Aoun, both Christians,could bring another round of artillery warfare.   Aoun contends Parliament's election of Hrawi, with Syriansupport, was unconstitutional and refuses to vacate hisheadquarters bunker beneath the presidential palace in Baabda, aChristian suburb east of Beirut.   He also rejects the peace plan Hrawi is trying to implementbecause it does not include a timetable for withdrawal of theSyrians, whom he describes as an occupation army.   Streets were deserted after the first few rounds of gunfireacross the line at midday. Syrian troops manning west Beirutcheckpoints took cover behind sandbag barricades and many residentsran straight to bomb shelters.   In an interview published by the independent daily newspaperAn-Nahar, Hrawi said, ``I will ask the Syrian army to withdraw fromareas that the (government) can gain authority over.'' He said thiswould be done ``after the extraordinary situation in the easternareas is over.''   By ``eastern areas,'' he meant the 310-square-mile enclave northand east of Beirut where about 1 million Christians live and Aoun'ssoldiers are in control.   Syrian soldiers are in Lebanon under a peacekeeping mandateissued by the Arab League in 1976, one year after the beginning ofa civil war that has cost more than 150,000 lives.</TEXT></DOC>
