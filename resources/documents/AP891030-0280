Federal mediator Doug Hammond brought both sides together aftertalking separately Sunday with negotiators for the company and theInternational Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers.   Hammond said he wants to keep both sides talking until anagreement is reached, ``but we'll see once they get here.''   Neither side, however, has changed its stance, with the unionsaying it wants more money out of the prosperous aerospace companyand Boeing saying it's offered all it will.   Hammond said he could not talk about issues in the strike. Hesaid Sunday's talks simply involved negotiators redefining theirpositions to him and setting up terms of today's discussions.   The negotiations are the first since an effort by Hammond torestart the talks failed Oct. 18.   Hammond said there was no specific item that got the two sidestalking again, other than his decision it was time for negotiationsto resume.   ``Doug Hammond is a professional. He knows how to read theclimate and when it's time to get the two sides together,'' saidBoeing spokesman Paul Binder.   Some 57,800 members of the Machinists union are on strikeagainst Boeing nationwide in the walkout that began Oct. 4.   ``It is appropriate for Boeing and the union to resumenegotiations at this point to hear each other's position across thebargaining table,'' chief Boeing negotiator Larry McKean said lateSunday in a statement. ``Beyond that, I cannot speculate on thedirection, timing or ultimate outcome of the negotiations.''   ``This round of bargaining will hopefully lead to a settlement,but you have to be at the table to discuss the issues before youagree on them,'' Tom Baker, president of IAM District Lodge 751,said Sunday night.   Of the money issue, Baker said succinctly, ``They got it, wewant it.''   Boeing said today that its net earnings for the quarter endingSept. 30 were $242 million, or $1.05 a share, on revenue of $6.36billion, compared with profits of $144 million, or 63 cents ashare, on revenue of $3.72 billion a year earlier.   For the first nine months of 1989, Boeing had net earnings of$598 million, or $2.60 a share, on revenue of $15.43 billion,compared with earnings of $440 million, or $1.92 a share, onrevenue of $12.09 billion.   The third-quarter figures don't show effects from the strike,but Boeing warned today that the walkout would seriously hurt salesand earnings the rest of the year.   The strike began after machinists overwhelmingly rejectedBoeing's three-year contract offer that included annual pay raisesof 4 percent, 3 percent and 3 percent and bonuses of 8 percent inthe first year and 3 percent in the second. The offer also hadcost-of-living increases to virtually cover inflation, a reductionin mandatory overtime from 200 to 160 hours per quarter and higherbenefits.   Machinists represent 43,300 Boeing workers in the Seattle area,12,000 in Wichita, Kan., 1,700 in Portland, Ore., and a few hundredothers in California, Hawaii, Utah, Montana, Wyoming and otherstates.   Boeing, which employs 164,000 workers worldwide and about106,000 in the Seattle area, has kept its plants open and delivered15 commercial jets since the strike began.   Machinists last week collected the first of their $100-a-weekstrike payments. Health insurance for strikers expires thisWednesday, though employees can extend the coverage by payingpremiums themselves.   Last Friday, Boeing announced plans to reorganize its militaryand aerospace business to reduce losses and cut overhead. Thechanges primarily involve redrawing managment assignments withlittle change in job assignments or employment level at any plants.Boeing spokesmen said the decision was unrelated to the strike.   The jets Boeing has delivered during the strike were allvirtually completed before the walkout began. So far this year,Boeing has received orders for 807 commercial jets valued at $43billion.</TEXT></DOC>
