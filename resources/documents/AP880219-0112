GANS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An influential Communist Party weeklycriticized the official anti-Semitic campaign in 1968 that led tothe flight of most of the country's surviving Jewish population.   The article in the Feb. 20 issue of the weekly Polityka, seentoday, was the first in an official publication to offer a detailedaccount reappraising the 1968 events and referring specifically toan ``anti-Semitic'' campaign.   Its publication comes before the 20th anniversary of March 1968student protests against censorship, which sparked what authoritiesthen called an ``anti-Zionist'' campaign that led to the dismissalof thousands of Jews from official posts.   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban on Tuesday promised a``detailed discussion'' of the 1968 crisis in officialpublications. The government condemns ``any manifestations ofanti-Semitism, both in the past and at present,'' he said.   A party source close to Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelskisaid the Polityka article was the first in a series of reappraisalsthat will appear in the press, radio and television, including amajor commentary planned for the party's official newspaper TrybunaLudu.   ``This is the time of perestroika (reconstruction) and it istime to liquidate the mistakes, the black points on the moralside,'' said the source, requesting anonymity.   Perestroika describes the social and economic reforms promotedby Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev. The Soviet Union has beenre-evaluating its history in a more critical light.   ``We will take a clear position against anti-Semitism,'' thesource said. ``We want to close this chapter, which was a veryunhappy chapter in our history.''   In a front-page introduction to a chronology of events connectedwith 1968, two Polityka staff members, Wieslaw Wladyka and ZbyslawRykowski, wrote that ``March (1968) has been an embarrassing issuefor 20 years.''   ``The legacy of March remains: the shame of the anti-Semiticfuss, the reform of socialism buried for years, the intelligentsialeft at odds with the working class, human damage.''   They wrote that the crisis was triggered by the failure ofthen-Communist Party leader Wladyslaw Gomulka to make basicpolitical and economic reforms, partially under the influence ofconservative Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev. As the countrystagnated, Gomulka reacted with repressive measures againstreformers and dissident intellectuals.   They said the ``anti-Semitic syndrome in political thinking''was part of a power struggle within the party leadership aimed atunseating Gomulka. His opponents tried to appeal for popularsupport with nationalist slogans.   The anti-Semitic campaign was ignited after the 1967Arab-Israeli war when some Polish officials and army officers ofJewish origin were accused of celebrating the Israeli victory overthe Soviet-backed Arab armies.   But the campaign did not pick up momentum until after the March1968 student riots, which authorities blamed on ``Zionisttraitors.'' About 9,000 Jews were dismissed from posts in theparty, party, government, army and other institutions.   The campaign led to the emigration of most of the 30,000 Jewsliving in Poland. Before the Nazi Holocaust of World War II, Polandwas home to about 3.5 million Jews, or 10 percent of the population.   Polityka said the precise number of emigres is unknown, butcited various estimates saying that 12,000 to 20,000 Jews leftPoland in 1967-69.</TEXT></DOC>
