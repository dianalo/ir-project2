His image was such that WoodyAllen lampooned him in the movie ``Sleeper'' as the guy whoprecipitated nuclear war.   That image gave way as Shanker began rubbing elbows withgovernors and corporate chieftains; got a seat on the TrilateralCommission, a high-powered foreign policy group; and launched aweekly ``Where We Stand'' column that appears as a paidadvertisement in the Sunday New York Times. He is also a vicepresident of the AFL-CIO.   Shanker, president of the 665,000-member AFT since 1974, haslong championed tough school standards and was an early advocate ofrigorous tests for incoming teachers. He had a pivotal role in thecreation of a voluntary National Board for Professional TeachingStandards.   His adversaries scoff at the image of the new Shanker, and evensome of his allies think he has too little faith in the efficacy oftraditional instruction.   Secretary of Education William J. Bennett, a persistent criticof mediocre school performance, says Shanker has failed ``torecognize the power of a great teacher.''   Myron Lieberman, an education professor who championedcollective bargaining for teachers in the 1950s and is now anunsparing critic of unions, calls Shanker ``the most skillfulmanipulator in the field of education.''   Lieberman, who teaches at the University of Pennsylvania, says,``The image of him as some kind of courageous statesman doesn'tsquare with my experience and my perception. What Al says is notbinding on any local organization. ... The AFT contract in Chicagois a complete disaster from any public or parent point of view.''   Bennett has called Chicago's schools the nation's worst and laidmuch of the blame at the door of the Chicago Teachers Union, Local1 of the AFT, which has struck nine times in the past 19 years.   ``They have bludgeoned that school system. The union has takenwhat it could get and has not served the teachers,'' says Bennett.   Bennett says the AFT has been ``a bit more innovative, not sohidebound'' as the National Education Association in places such asRochester, N.Y., Dade County, Fla., and Hammond, Ind., whereShanker's locals have accepted stricter accountability in exchangefor more say in running schools.   But Bennett says the experience in Chicago shows the AFT ``canbe as intransigent and mindless as the NEA.''   Shanker says of the situation in Chicago, ``They're in themiddle of a war.''   ``I don't feel any need to call Jackie Vaughan and say, `Makenice and talk differently,' because she doesn't have anybody todeal with on the other side,'' says Shanker, referring to the CTU'spresident. ``I think if there were some opening to really be ableto do something there, she would be very cooperative.''   Bill Honig, California's superintendent of public instructionand an ally of Shanker's on curricular reform, says, ``While Iagree with Al we're nowhere near where we have to be, I thinkschool is getting a lot better for a large number of kids, not just20 percent.''   When storm clouds gathered over American schools in 1983 withthe release of the explosive ``A Nation At Risk'' report, Shankerquickly signaled that his union was willing to consider any and allreforms.   He was rewarded with invitations to the White House, andPresident Reagan addressed the AFT convention that summer, usingthe occasion to blast the NEA for opposing merit pay and forsponsoring a dovish course guide to nuclear arms.   But Shanker was never enamored of Reagan's education policies,and his relations with Bennett have turned frosty of late.   After attending a White House ceremony last April marking thefifth anniversary of ``A Nation At Risk,'' Shanker sent an openletter to Bennett accusing him of a ``major failure of leadership.''   Mary Hatwood Futrell, president of the 1.9 million-member NEA,remarks, ``It took him 3{ years to realize Mr. Bennett was not anadvocate for education.''   She charges that Shanker grabbed headlines with controversialstands on merit pay and by favoring choice in public education andthen backed away from them.   Shanker says part of the problem with American schools is thattoo many parents and teachers are comfortable with the status quo.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, July 17</NOTE></DOC>
