If ratified, the agreement for Local 250 of the Hospital andHealth Care Workers Union could lead to a return of hospitaltechnicians, licensed vocational nurses, orderlies and food serviceemployees back to work.   However, the union on strike since July 26 would then have todecide whether to cross the picket lines of 2,000 nurses on strikesince Aug. 2 at six of the medical centers.   Union trustee Mark Splain said there is a provision in thetentative agreement that Local 250 members would not go back towork until the nurses' strike is settled. It was unclear whetherthe provision would be strictly enforced, particularly if theCalifornia Nurses Association strike is not quickly settled.   The dispute between the service worker's union and AffiliatedHospitals had centered on health benefits and sick leave grantedemployees.   ``We do think it's a fair contract,'' Splain said. ``Compromiseswere made on both sides and it does restore the basic cuts inbenefits that we were fighting for. I think the membership willratify the contract.''   According to a Local 250 statement issued Saturday, the proposedtwo-year contract grants wage increases of 3 percent for each ofthe next two years for licensed vocational nurses and so-calledsecond wage-tier employees.   Technicians will get a 1.65 percent raise this year, and 3percent next year. Some other job classifications will receive aone-time bonus of between $200 and $300.   Most importantly, the union said, workers will not have to paypart of the cost of medical insurance unless they choose to seedoctors not involved in the Affiliated Hospitals' healthmaintenance organization.   The nurses' union is fighting for pay increases and improvedstaffing conditions. CNA representatives have said bargainingbetween the hospitals and striking nurses would quickly follow anysettlement with the service workers union.</TEXT></DOC>
