Following the introduction of high field (1.5 Tesla) wholebodysystems it is possible to perform spectroscopic studies on human beings.Thus, MR-spectroscopy may become a very important research tool in physiology,clinical diagnosis and treatment follow-up. So far the human studieshave concentrated on the phosphorus (/sup 31/P) and (/sup 1/H) nuclei.</TEXT></DOC>
