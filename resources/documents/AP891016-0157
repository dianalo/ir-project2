In the other semifinal, Jan Timman of the Netherlands took atimeout, postponing the eighth game of his tied semifinal with JonSpeelman of England. After seven games, each player has scored 3.5points.   Final round faceoffs in both contests are set for Tuesday.   After a zig-zag battle, Karpov emerged from a nerve-wrackingtime scramble, a pawn behind in an endgame but in a position whereYusupov had very few chances to win.   The winner of the Candidates' cycle will challenge worldchampion Garri Kasparov for his title in a 24-game contest startingOctober 1990. The winning semifinalists will face off in theCandidates' final next March.   If either of the eight-game contests ends in a 4-4 tie, atwo-game minimatch will be played, followed if necessary by suddendeath tiebreakers.   A win scores one point and a draw a half.   Karpov held the world title for 10 years until 1985 and had beenwidely expected to crush his opponent.   His poor performance led Spanish chess commentator LeontxoGarcia to remark, ``Karpov is very close to the abyss and only theadvantage of the white pieces can save him.''   Karpov and Speelman will play white on Tuesday.   A decisive victory in the sixth game on Saturday left Speelmanwith the psychological initiative.   Playing white on Monday, Yusupov failed to gain any advantagefrom the opening and began to fall dangerously short of time.   But a faulty plan from Karpov starting on the 24th move letYusupov escape the pressure, and white suddenly gained theinitiative in the center by combining a battery of two rooks and aqueen.   Karpov sank deep into thought, leaving himself three minutes tomake 10 moves.   As Yusopov exchanged down to reach an ending with an extra pawn,Karpov's nerves began to show.   But after reaching the time control, Karpov had few problems inachieving a draw.   Yusupov played on for a further 20 moves, but finally gave upand offered a draw after playing his 61st move.</TEXT></DOC>
