 Sun has introduced new releases of PC-NFS and a companionproduct, PC-NFS LifeLine Mail and Backup.andM;In addition, Sun rolled out PC-NFS Advanced Telnet, a new terminal emulationproduct that gives PCs greater access to applications on mainframes andminicomputers.andM;The comprehensive PC-NFS family is the industry leader in its field.andP;  Thisproduct line includes solutions for file and printer sharing, electronicmail, terminal emulation and the creation of distributed applications througha developer's toolkit.andM;PC-NFS is based on Sun's ONC/NFS, an industry standard in multi-vendornetworks, with an installed base of 1.3 million systems.andP;  This gives PCsequipped with PC-NFS access to any system that utilizes ONC/NFS.andM;The enhancements to the PC-NFS product line demonstrate Sun's growing focuson bringing the many benefits of UNIX client/server computing to DOS PCs.andO;&quot;Networked systems -- particularly those using UNIX -- are the industry'sbiggest growth segment by far,&quot; said Cheryl Vedoe, vice president of softwareproduct marketing at Sun.andM;&quot;With PC-NFS, PC users, network managers and application developers can sharein this client/server world without losing their existing investment.&quot;andM;Sun's new release, PC-NFS 3.5, is compatible with MS Windows 3.0.andP;  Thisenables users to access information, interact with the network and performthe many other tasks made possible with PC-NFS withinandM;the familiar, easy-to-use Windows environment.andP;   In addition, thisandM;latest release gives users greater productivity through added support ofindustry standards.andM;For example, networked PCs can now be monitored along with UNIX workstationsand other systems on the network because of support for SNMP (Simple NetworkManagement Protocol).andP;  Many network management products such as SunNetManager are based on this protocol.andM;PC-NFS 3.5 also supports the 3Com/Microsoft NDIS (Network Driver InterfaceSpecification).andP;  As a result, almost every vendor's Ethernet board -- whichis installed in the PC and necessary for PC-NFS connectivity -- can be used.andM;This new release makes possible greater sharing of network resources byallowing simultaneous access of up to 14 network devices, such as printersand storage systems.andP;  In addition, network users can now access PC printers,in addition to the printers attached to ONC/NFS servers.andM;PC users now have many of the electronic mail functions normally found inlarger systems as a result of PC-NFS LifeLine Mail and Backup 2.0.andP;  Thisadd-on application has always supported industry standards such as POP (PostOffice Protocol) and SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) which gives userswide access to other popular third-party e-mail services.andP;  The new releasenow supports the 8-bit ASCII format, allowing users to communicate easilywith international locations.andM;In addition, PC-NFS LifeLine now permits notification of incoming mailthrough a new configuration feature and lets users send several filesattached to a single mail message.andP;  It also has a new automated DOS-basedscheduler that performs time-consuming tasks like disk backup in off hours.andM;A new add-on application, PC-NFS Advanced Telnet, was co-developed by Sun andWalker Richer andamp; Quinn, the leading supplier of PC-based terminal emulationproducts.andM;Based on its popular REFLECTION series, this new product expands the existingVT 100 terminal emulation capabilities of PC-NFS.andP;  Advanced Telnet lets usersaccess IBM mainframe, DEC VAX and Tektronix applications on non-ONC hosts byemulating popular terminals such as the TN 3270, VT 320 and Tektronix 4014.andO;In addition, the product is compatible with Windows 3.0.andM;Advanced Telnet has a range of sophisticated features that deliver fast,accurate emulation, such as the ability to manage up to three hosts sessionssimultaneously and switch between PC and host sessions with a singlekeystroke.andP;  The product also lets users customize their keyboard to match therequirements of specific hosts and applications.andM;In addition, it offers international transfer of characters through supportfor 8-bit data streams.andM;The PC-NFS family is a comprehensive solution for integrating PCs intomulti-vendor networks of diverse systems.andP;  It gives PC users a range ofservices and capabilities that are usually reserved for more powerfulnetworked systems.andM;An important component is the PC-NFS developer's toolkit, for creatingdistributed applications in which various parts of an application areperformed by different systems.andP;  For example, using the PC's familiarinterface, workgroups can access a distributed financial database residing ona workstation.andP;  PC-NFS LifeLine and PC-NFS Advanced Telnet were bothdeveloped with the toolkit.andM;PC-NFS 3.5 is available now and priced at $395 per copy.andP;  A site-wide upgradepackage is available for existing PC-NFS users.andP;  PC-NFS LifeLine Mail andBackup 2.0 is priced at $125 and will be available April 30.andM;PC-NFS Advanced Telnet now costs $180 -- a 20 percent discount -- as part ofa special introductory offer (ending July 30) and will be available April 1.andO;All prices include documentation.andP;  Quantity pricing is available.andM;All PC-NFS products can be ordered through Sun's telemarketing service bycalling 1-800/USA-4SUN (1-800/872-4786) in the United States.andP;  Customers willreceive their order within five days.andP;  PC-NFS is also available worldwidethrough any Sun sales office or distributor.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
