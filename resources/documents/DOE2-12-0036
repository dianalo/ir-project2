The curedpolycarbosilane fibers were heat-treated at temperatures of 1200, 1400and 1500deg C and then SiC(E) fibers were prepared. Their tensile strengthswere 2.90, 19.2 and 1.49 GPa, respectively. For comparison, thermal oxidation-curedpolycarbosilane fibers were heat-treated at temperatures of 1200, 1400and 1500deg C and then SiC(O) fibers were prepared. Their tensile strengthswere 2.61, 0.68 GPa and almost null, respectively. The tensile strengthsof SiC(O) fibers dropped quickly with the heat treatment temperatures,and those of SiC(E) fibers decreased gradually. On the other hand, electronirradiation-cured polycarbosilane fibers were heat-treated in a streamof NH/sub 3/ gas and then Si/sub 3/N/sub 4/ fibers were prepared. Theirfibers were colorless and semi-transparent for visible light. The electronirradiation curing process is considered to be promising in order toprepare SiC fibers with high strength at higher temperature or to preparenew Si/sub 3/N/sub 4/ fibers.</TEXT></DOC>
