The new standard issued by the department's OccupationalSafety and Health Administration requires that hospitals andother employers offer hepatitis B vaccinations to allemployees exposed to blood and other bodily fluids. Employersalso must provide medical counseling and follow-up care afterany exposure to such fluids.</LP><TEXT>   Although the use of rubber gloves and other protectiveclothing is common in health-care facilities, the new rulesare broader and more detailed. Violating the OSHA guidelinescould result in fines of as much as $70,000 per incident.   Since 1987, the government has urged hospitals and otheremployers to use precautions established by the Department ofHealth and Human Service's Centers for Disease Control thatcover many of the same practices set out in the OSHA rules.   The new rules will affect about five million workers andcost hospitals and other employers about $821 millionannually, OSHA officials said. Personal protective equipmentalone will cost about $334 million annually. A wide varietyof workers are covered by the rule, including those employedby funeral homes and linen services, as well as lawenforcement officials.   Gerard Scannell, assistant secretary of labor for OSHA,said although the virus that causes AIDS is rarelytransmitted in the workplace, &quot;it's vital that we protectworkers who put their lives on the line&quot; to care for others.The new rules are expected to prevent more than 200 deathsand 9,200 blood-borne infections each year, OSHA officialssaid. Roughly 6,000 to 7,000 cases of infection with thehepatitis B virus result each year from occupationalexposures, they added.   The new rules represent a fine-tuning of the earlier CDCstandards, said Donald Savelson, an employment lawyer basedin New York. The OSHA standard, for example, calls for&quot;engineering controls,&quot; such as puncture-resistant containersfor used needles.   The agency also will require specific housekeepingprocedures, including a written schedule for generalcleaning, and for the discarding of contaminated sharpinstruments and regulated wastes. Employers will have to usewarning labels and train workers about the risks ofcontamination.   In addition, OSHA will release a series of fact sheetsover the next several months focusing on specificrequirements of the guidelines. The agency also will issuebooklets targeted at acute-care facilities, dental offices,and emergency-care personnel and long-term care facilities.   The rules will take effect 90 days after being publishedin the Federal Register.</TEXT></DOC>
