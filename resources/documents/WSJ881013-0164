In the Sept. 25 presidential debate, George Bush stated, &quot;He {Dukakis} said 'I am a card-carrying member of the ACLU.' He is out there out of the mainstream. My argument with the governor is, do we want this country to go that far left?&quot; Both Mr. Dukakis and the ACLU have vehemently opposed the assertion that they are &quot;out of the mainstream&quot; or push the &quot;liberal agenda.&quot;    The ACLU states that its leaders &quot;make their best efforts to stand on, and for, the constitutional principles our Founding Fathers intended for our nation.&quot; They take pride in showing that they have supported Lt. Col. Oliver North's Fifth Amendment rights, Nazi and Ku Klux Klan First Amendment rights, and the right of the pope to use the Washington Mall.    However, they also purport it to be the right of a woman to govern her own body and kill her unborn child. Yet, the government cannot take away a criminal's right to life, even if he has murdered a police officer, a person who coincidentally protects our rights. They even claim it to be a person's right to disseminate the decadence of child pornography.    The results of this claim are the distortion of the moral basis of free speech and the ravaging of children's civil liberties. It is this form of amoral, secular equivocation that is causing society to become hardened to the moral depravity that has been allowed to filter into our lives through the mail, television, radio or any other forum. The right of free speech is not all inclusive. We all know that free speech does not include the right to &quot;yell 'fire' in a crowded theater.&quot; Nor should the right be perverted to include the evils of child porn.    The ACLU has distorted the intent of our Founding Fathers who wished to protect the church from the state, not the state from the church.    The ACLU has used intensive propaganda to stress its protection of the individual rights that our Founding Fathers laid out for us in the Constitution. However, upon examination of the ACLU's founding father, Roger Baldwin, and his theories on &quot;natural rights,&quot; one gets a view of the organization's theoretical basis.    Mr. Baldwin founded the ACLU in 1920, nearly two years after serving a prison term for draft resistance. He did not oppose the draft for libertarian reasons. He opposed it for reasons of class struggle. He felt the rich had created, and continued, U.S. participation in World War I.    Class struggle is an inherent part of Mr. Baldwin's idea of &quot;natural rights.&quot; He felt that business had created a &quot;class government,&quot; a &quot;dictatorship of property in the name of patriotism.&quot; He felt this could be remedied when &quot;the victims of oppression exercise their 'power to take and hold' their 'natural right,' or when these 'rights' are made 'legal' as a result of the absence of 'class conflict.'&quot; The intrinsic ideal at the core of the ACLU is this socialist notion of class warfare and working for a classless society.    A false mask of patriotism hides this underlying notion. Mr. Baldwin stated, &quot;We want also to look like patriots in everything we do. We want to get a lot of good flags, talk a good deal about the Constitution and what our forefathers wanted to make of this country, and show that we are the folks that really stand for the spirit of our institutions.&quot;    So it seems as though Mr. Baldwin and the ACLU have a different concept of the meaning and the scope of the Bill of Rights and the Constitution. Their support of cases, be they communist, or Klan member, is all part of the agenda to promote the rights found in a classless society. The effect of this is that society must take the blame for the wrongs of its members. It becomes increasingly difficult for people to be held accountable, by law, for their actions. It is this muddying of the legal waters that threatens the fiber of the country.    George Bush was not at all off-base when he stated the ACLU and Michael Dukakis are &quot;out of the mainstream.&quot; The controversy over the validity of his statements is testimony to the effectiveness of Roger Baldwin's skill of obfuscation that has lived on at the very core of his organization.
