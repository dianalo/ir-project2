The useof congenic mice with alloenzyme markers permitted the identificationof host and donor cells in the peripheral blood of transfused animals.Donor cells were present initially in all hosts. Between 55% and 92%of the animals became 100% host type by 12-24 weeks after transfusionin three separate experiments. To explore whether the temporary repopulationby donor cells was due to short-lived stem cells, the marrows of severalprimary hosts were transfused into secondary, lethally irradiated hosts.Some of the retransplanted primary donor and host cells persisted onlytemporarily. It is suggested that some of the donor stem cells in boththe primary and secondary hosts had an intrinsically shortened life span.</TEXT></DOC>
