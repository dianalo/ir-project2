Federal agencies traditionally have developed theirown contracting procedures with limited attention to uniformity among agencies.The result was a system of procurement policies that varied from agencyto agency, causing confusion within the contracting community. As longago as 1972, the Commission on Government Procurement recommended thatthere be a standard Government-wide procurement regulatory system. TheOffice of Federal Procurement Policy, created in 1974, has worked withthe agencies and the public to create a uniform procurement regulationknown as the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). The FAR has been promulgated as the uniform, simplified acquisition regulationcalled for by Executive Order 12352, Federal Procurement Reforms. The FAR,which was issued by the General Services Administration, Department ofDefense, and National Aeronautics and Space Administration, supersededthe Defense Acquisition Regulation (DAR), the Federal Procurement Regulation(FPR), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ProcurementRegulation (NASAPR) on April 1, 1984. The FAR was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on September 19, 1983 (48 FR 42102) with an effectivedate of April 1, 1984. The FAR is codified as Chapter 1 of Title 48 ofthe Code of Federal Regulations. Because of differing statutory authorities among Federal agencies, theFAR authorizes the agencies to issue regulations to implement FAR policiesand procedures within the agency and to include additional policies andprocedures, solicitation provisions or contract clauses to satisfy thespecific needs of the agency. The regulations being published today representthe NRC's necessary implementation and supplementing of the FAR. <ITAG tagnum="84">Administrative Procedure Act </ITAG>Section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 551 et seq.)exempts rules relating to public contracts from the prior notice and commentprocedure normally required for informal rulemaking. However, the Officeof Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP), Office of Management and Budget,has established procedures to be used by all Federal agencies in the promulgationof procurement regulations. OFPP Policy Letter 83-2 states that an agencymust provide an opportunity for public comment before adopting procurementregulation if the regulation is ``significant.'' ``Significant'' is definedgenerally as something which has an effect beyond the internal operatingprocedures of the agency or has a cost or administrative impact on contractors.The NRC has determined that this rule is not significant within the meaningof OFPP Policy Letter No. 83-2. This regulation is issued principally tocreate one body of guidance incorporating previously cleared procedures,to exercise delegations established by the FAR and to adopt other proceduresthat will not have a cost or administrative impact on contractors. While not required to do so under the terms of OFPP Policy Letter 83-2,the NRC is issuing the NRC Acquisition Regulation (NRCAR) as a proposedrule. The NRC is accepting comments on this regulation for 60 days afterthe date of publication. The NRC will review all comments and will considerchanges to the rule. <ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Impact: Categorical Exclusion </ITAG>The NRC has determined that this proposed regulation is the type of actiondescribed in the categorical exclusion set forth in 10 CFR 51.22(c)(5).Therefore, neither an environmental impact statement nor an environmentalassessment is required for this proposed rule. <ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act Statement </ITAG>This proposed rule includes information collection requirements that aresubject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.).Accordingly, this rule has been submitted to the Office of Management andBudget for review and approval of the paperwork requirements Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimatedto average 12 hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions,searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed,and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send commentsregarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection ofinformation, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to the Recordsand Reports Management Branch, Division of Information Support Services,Office of Information Resources Management, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555; and to the Paperwork Reduction Project (3150- ),Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Certification </ITAG>As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 605(b),the Commission certifies that this rule, if adopted, will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The proposedrule would establish the procedures and requirements necessary to implementand supplement the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) which will governthe acquisition of goods and services by the NRC. To the extent that theproposed rule would affect a small entity, it sets out provisions applicableto small business and to small, disadvantaged business concerns. <ITAG tagnum="84">Backfit Analysis </ITAG>The NRC has determined that a backfit analysis is not required for thisproposed rule, because this proposed regulation does not involve any provisionwhich would impose backfits as defined in 10 CFR 50.109(a)(1). <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 48 CFR Chapter 20 </ITAG>Government procurement, Nuclear Regulatory Commission Acquisition Regulations,Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.For the reasons set out in the preamble and under the authority of theAtomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, the Energy Reorganization Act of1974, as amended, and 5 U.S.C. 553, the NRC is proposing to add Chapter20 to Title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations. 1.

(b) <T3>Numbering. </T3>The numbering system and part, subpart and sectiontitles used in this Chapter 20 conform with those used in the FAR as follows:(1) Where Chapter 20 implements the FAR or supplements a parallel part,subpart, section, subsection, or paragraph of the FAR, that implementationor supplementation is numbered and captioned to the FAR part, subpart,section or subsection being implemented or supplemented, except that theimplementation or supplementation is preceded with a 20 or 200 so thatthere will always be four numbers to the left of the decimal. For example,NRC's implementation of FAR 1.104-1 is shown as 2001.104-1 and the NRC'simplementation of FAR 24.1 is shown as 2024.1.(2) When NRC supplements material contained in the FAR, it is given a uniquenumber containing the numerals ``70'' or higher. The rest of the numberparallels the FAR part, subpart, section, subsection, or paragraph it issupplementing. For example, Section 170A of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954as amended requires a more comprehensive organizational conflicts of interestreview for NRC than is contemplated by FAR 9.5. This supplementary materialis identified as 2009.570. (3) Where material in the FAR requires no implementation or supplementation,there is no corresponding numbering in the NRCAR. Therefore, there maybe gaps in the NRCAR sequence of numbers where the FAR, as written, isapplicable to the NRCAR and requires no further implementation. (c) <T3>Citation. </T3>The NRCAR will be cited in accordance with Federal RegisterStandards approved for the FAR. Thus, this section when referred to inthe NRCAR is cited as 2001.104-2(c). When this section is referred to formallyin official documents, such as legal briefs, it should be cited as ``48CFR 2001.104-2(c).'' Any section of the NRCAR may be formally identifiedby the section number, e.g., ``NRCAR 2001.104-2.'' In the NRCAR, any referenceto the FAR will be indicated by ``FAR'' followed by the section number,for example FAR 1-104. <ITAG tagnum="80">2001.104-3</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Copies. </ITAG>Copies of the NRCAR in <T4>Federal Register</T4> and CFR form may be purchased from the Superintendentof Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402. <ITAG tagnum="80">2001.105</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Information collection requirements: OMB approval. </ITAG>(a) The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has submitted the information collectionrequirements contained in this part to the Office of Management and Budget(OMB) for approval as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44U.S.C. 3501 et seq.).

L. 95-601, adding Sec. 170A to Pub. L.83-703, 68 Stat. 919, as amended (42 U.S.C. Ch. 14), NRC acquisitions areprocessed in accordance with 2009.570, which supplements FAR 9.5 with respectto organizational conflicts of interest.

It is not possible to prescribe in advance a specificmethod or set of criteria which would serve to identify and resolve allof the contractor conflict of interest situations which might arise. However,examples are provided in these regulations to guide application of thispolicy guidance. The ultimate test is as follows: Might the contractor,if awarded the contract, be placed in a position where its judgment maybe biased, or where it may have an unfair competitive advantage? (c) The conflict of interest rule contained in this subpart applies tocontractors and offerors only. Individuals or firms who have other relationshipswith the NRC (e.g., parties to a licensing proceeding) are not coveredby this regulation. This rule does not apply to the acquisition of consultingservices through the personnel appointment process, NRC agreements withother government agencies, international organizations, or state, local,or foreign governments. Separate procedures for avoiding conflicts of interestwill be employed in these agreements, as appropriate. <ITAG tagnum="80">2009.570-2 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Definitions. </ITAG>As used in andSection; 2009.570: <T3>Affiliates </T3>means business concerns which are affiliates of eachother when either directly or indirectly one concern or individual controlsor has the power to control another, or when a third party controls orhas the power to control both. <T3>Contract </T3>means any contractual agreement or other arrangementwith the NRC except as provided in andSection; 2009.570-1(b). <T3>Contractor </T3>means any person, firm, unincorporated association,joint venture, co-sponsor, partnership, corporation, affiliates thereof,or thelr successors in interest, including their chief executives, directors,key personnel (identified in the contract), proposed consultants or subcontractors,which are a party to a contract with the NRC. <T3>Evaluation activities </T3>means any effort involving the appraisalof a technology, process, product, or policy. <T3>Offeror or prospective contractor </T3>means any person, firm, unincorporatedassociation, joint venture, co-sponsor, partnership, corporation, or theiraffiliates or successors in interest including their chief executives,directors, key personnel, proposed consultants or subcontractors, submittinga bid or proposal, solicited or unsolicited, to the NRC to obtain a contract.<T3>Organizational conflict of interest </T3>means that a relationshipexists whereby a contractor or prospective contractor has present or plannedinterests related to the work to be performed under an NRC contract which:(1) May diminish its capacity to give impartial, technically sound, objectiveassistance and advice or may otherwise result in a biased work product;or (2) May result in its being given an unfair competitive advantage. <T3>Potential conflict of interest </T3>means that a factual situationexists that suggests (indicates) that an actual conflict of interest mayarise from award of a proposed contract. The term ``potential conflictof interest'' is used to signify those situations which merit investigationprior to contract award in order to ascertain whether award would giverise to an actual conflict or which must be reported to the contractingofficer for investigation if they arise during contract performance. <T3>Research </T3>means any scientific or technical work involving theoreticalanalysis, exploration, or experimentation. <T3>Subcontractor </T3>means any subcontractor of any tier which performswork under a contract with the NRC except subcontracts for supplies andsubcontracts in the amount of $25,000 or less. <T3>Technical consulting and management support services </T3>means internalassistance to a component of the NRC in the formulation or administrationof its programs, projects, or policies which normally require that thecontractor be given access to information which has not been made availableto the public, or to proprietary information. These services typicallyinclude assistance in the preparation of program plans, preliminary designs,specifications, or statements of work. <ITAG tagnum="80">2009.570-3</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Criteria for recognizing contractor organizational conflicts of interest.</ITAG>(a) <T3>General. </T3>(1) Two questions will be asked in determining whetheractual or potential organizational conflicts of interest exist: (i) Are there conflicting roles which might bias an offeror's or contractor'sjudgment in relation to its work for the NRC? (ii) May the offeror or contractor be given an unfair competitive advantagebased on the performance of the contract? (2) The ultimate determination by the NRC as to whether organizationalconflicts of interest exist will be made in light of common sense and goodbusiness judgment based upon the relevant facts. While it is difficultto identify and to prescribe in advance a specific method for avoidingall of the various situations or relationships which might involve potentialorganizational conflicts of interest, NRC personnel will pay particularattention to proposed contractual requirements which call for the renderingof advice, consultation or evaluation activities, or similar activitiesthat lay direct groundwork for the NRC's decisions on regulatory activities,future procurements, and research programs. (b) <T3>Situations or relationships. </T3>The following situations or relationshipsmay give rise to organizational conflicts of interest: (1) The offeror or contractor shall disclose information concerning relationshipswhich may give rise to organizational conflicts of interest under the followingcircumstances: (i) Where the offeror or contractor provides advice and recommendationto the NRC in a technical area in which it is also providing consultingassistance in the same area to any organization regulated by the NRC. (ii) Where the offeror or contractor provides advice to the NRC on thesame or similar matter in which it is also providing assistance to anyorganization regulated by the NRC.(iii) Where the offeror or contractor evaluates its own products or services,or the products or services of another entity where the offeror or contractorhas been substantially involved in their development or marketing. (iv) Where the award of a contract would otherwise result in placing theofferor or contractor in a conflicting role in which its judgment may bebiased in relation to its work for the NRC or may otherwise result in anunfair competitive advantage for the offeror or contractor. (2) The contracting officer may request specific information from an offeroror contractor or may require special contract clauses such as providedin 2009.570-5(b) in the following circumstances: (i) Where the offeror or contractor prepares specifications which are tobe used in competitive procurements of products or services covered bythe specifications. (ii) Where the offeror or contractor prepares plans for specific approachesor methodologies that are to be incorporated into competitive procurementsusing the approaches or methodologies. (iii) Where the offeror or contractor is granted access to informationnot available to the public concerning NRC plans, policies, or programswhich could form the basis for a later procurement action. (iv) Where the offeror or contractor is granted access to proprietary informationof its competitors. (v) Where the award of a contract might otherwise result in placing theofferor or contractor in a conflicting role in which its judgment may bebiased in relation to its work for the NRC or may otherwise result in anunfair competitive advantage for the offeror or contractor.(c) <T3>Policy application guidance.</T3> The following examples are illustrativeonly and are not intended to identify and resolve all contractor organizationalconflict of interest situations. (1)(i) <T3>Example.</T3> The ABC Corp., in response to a Request For Proposal(RFP), proposes to undertake certain analyses of a reactor component ascalled for in the RFP. The ABC Corp. is one of several companies consideredto be technically well qualified. In response to the inquiry in the RFP,the ABC Corp. advises that it is currently performing similar analysesfor the reactor manufacturer. (ii) <T3>Guidance.</T3> An NRC contract for that particular work normally wouldnot be awarded to the ABC Corp. because it would be placed in a positionin which its judgment could be biased in relationship to its work for theNRC. Because there are other well-qualified companies available, therewould be no reason for considering a waiver of the policy. (2)(i) <T3>Example.</T3> The ABC Corp., in response to an RFP, proposes to performcertain analyses of a reactor component which is unique to one type ofadvanced reactor. As is the case with other technically qualified companiesresponding to the RFP, the ABC Corp. is performing various projects forseveral different utility clients. None of the ABC Corp. projects haveany relationship to the work called for in the RFP. Based on the NRC evaluation,the ABC Corp. is considered to be the best qualified company to performthe work outlined in the RFP. (ii) <T3>Guidance.</T3> An NRC contract normally could be awarded to the ABCCorp. because no conflict of interest exists which could motivate biaswith respect to the work. An appropriate clause would be included in thecontract to preclude the ABC Corp. from subsequently contracting for workduring the performance of the NRC contract with the private sector whichcould create a conflict. For example, ABC Corp. would be precluded fromthe performance of similar work for the company developing the advancedreactor mentioned in the example. (3)(i) <T3>Example.</T3> As a result of operating problems in a certain type ofcommercial nuclear facility, it is imperative that the NRC secure specificdata on various operational aspects of that type of plant so as to assureadequate safety protection of the public. Only one manufacturer has extensiveexperience with that type of plant. Consequently, that company is the onlyone with whom the NRC can contract which can develop and conduct the testingprograms required to obtain the data within reasonable time. That companyhas a definite interest in any NRC decisions that might result from thedata produced because those decisions affect the reactor's design and thusthe company's costs. (ii) <T3>Guidance.</T3> This situation would place the manufacturer in a rolein which its judgment could be biased in relationship to its work for theNRC. Because the nature of the work required is vitally important in termsof the NRC's responsibilities and no reasonable alternative exists, a waiverof the policy in accordance with 2009.570-9 may be warranted. Any waivermust be fully documented in accordance with the waiver provisions of thispolicy with particular attention to the establishment of protective mechanismsto guard against bias. (4)(i) <T3>Example.</T3> The ABC Co. submits a proposal for a new system for evaluatinga specific reactor component's performance for the purpose of developingstandards that are important to the NRC program. The ABC Co. has advisedthe NRC that it intends to sell the new system to industry once its practicabilityhas been demonstrated. Other companies in this business are using oldersystems for evaluation of the specific reactor component. (ii) <T3>Guidance.</T3> A contract could be awarded to the ABC Co. providedthat the contract stipulates that no information produced under the contractwill be used in the contractor's private activities unless this informationhas been reported to the NRC. Information which is reported to the NRCby contractors will normally be disseminated by the NRC to others so asto preclude an unfair competitive advantage that might otherwise accrue.When the NRC furnishes information to the contractor for the performanceof contractor work, the information may not be used in the contractor'sprivate activities unless the information is generally available to others.Further, the contract will stipulate that the contractor will inform theNRC contracting officer of all situations in which the information developedunder the contract is proposed to be used. (5)(i) <T3>Example.</T3> The ABC Corp., in response to a RFP, proposes to assemblea map showing certain seismological features of the Appalachian fold belt.In accordance with the representation in the RFP and 2009.570-3(b)(1)(i),ABC Corp. informs the NRC that it is presently doing seismological studiesfor several utilities in the Eastern United States but none of the sitesare within the geographic area contemplated by the NRC study. (ii) <T3>Guidance.</T3> The contracting officer would normally conclude thataward of a contract would not place ABC Corp. in a conflicting role whereits judgment might be biased. The work for others clause of 2052.209-74(c)would preclude ABC Corp. from accepting work during the term of the NRCcontract which could create a conflict of interest.(d) <T3>Other considerations. </T3>(1) The fact that the NRC can identify andlater avoid, eliminate, or neutralize any potential organizational conflictsarising from the performance of a contract is not relevant to a determinationof the existence of conflicts prior to the award of a contract. (2) It is not relevant that the contractor has the professional reputationof being able to resist temptations which arise from organizational conflictsof interest, or that a follow-on procurement is not involved, or that acontract is awarded on a competitive or a sole source basis. <ITAG tagnum="80">2009.570-4 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Representation. </ITAG>(a) The following procedures are designed to assist the NRC contractingofficer in determining whether situations or relationships exist whichmay constitute organizational conflicts of interest with respect to a particularofferor or contractor. (b) The organizational conflict of interest representation provision at2052.209-73 must be included in all solicitations and unsolicited proposalsfor: (1) Evaluation services or activities; (2) Technical consulting and management support services; (3) Research; and (4) Other contractual situations where special organizational conflictsof interest provisions are noted in the solicitation and would be includedin the resulting contract. This representation requirement also appliesto all modifications for additional effort under the contract except thoseissued under the ``Changes'' clause. Where, however, a statement of thetype required by the organizational conflicts of interest representationprovisions has previously been submitted with regard to the contract beingmodified, only an updating of the statement is required. (c) The offeror may, because of actual or potential organizational conflictsof interest, propose to exclude specific kinds of work contained in anRFP unless the RFP specifically prohibits the exclusion. Any such proposedexclusion by an offeror will be considered by the NRC in the evaluationof proposals. If the NRC considers the proposed excluded work to be anessential or integral part of the required work and its exclusion wouldbe to the detriment of the competitive posture of the other offerors, theNRC shall reject the proposal as unacceptable (d) The offeror's failure to execute the representation required by paragraph(b) of this section with respect to an invitation for bids is consideredto be a minor informality. The offeror will be permitted to correct theomission. <ITAG tagnum="80">2009.570-5 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Contract clauses.</ITAG>(a) <T3>General contract clause.</T3> All contracts and small purchases ofthe types set forth in 2009.570-4(b) must include the clause entitled,``Contractor Organizational Conflicts of Interest,'' set forth in 2052.209-74.(b) <T3>Addition to general clause for use when award of a follow-on contractwould constitute an organization conflict of interest.</T3> The contractingofficer shall add the additional paragraphs found at 2052.209-75 to theclause found at 2052.209-74 when it is determined that award of a follow-oncontract would constitute an organizational conflict of interest. (c) <T3>Addition to general clause for contractors having access to NRC-regulatedactivities.</T3> In contracts for on-site work where the contractor mayhave access to a utility site or other facility subject to NRC's regulatoryauthority or in any contract for technical support of NRC's regulatoryactivities, the contracting officer shall change paragraph (c), ``Workfor others,'' to (c)(1) and add new paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) foundat 2052.209-76. (d) <T3>Additions to general clause for task order contracts.</T3> In all contractsfor task order contracts, add a new sentence to paragraph (b), ``Scope,''and a new paragraph (d)(3) to paragraph (d), ``Disclosure after award,''as found at 2052.209.77. (e) <T3>Other special contract clauses.</T3> If it is determined from the natureof the proposed contract that an organizational conflict of interest exists,the contracting officer may determine that the conflict can be avoided,or, after obtaining a waiver in accordance with 2009.570-9, neutralizedthrough the use of an appropriate special contract clause. If appropriate,the offeror may negotiate the terms and conditions of these clauses, includingthe extent and time period of any restriction. These clauses include butare not limited to: (1) Hardware exclusion clauses which prohibit the acceptance of productioncontracts following a related non-production contract previously performedby the contractor; (2) Software exclusion clauses; (3) Clauses which require the contractor (and certain of its key personnel)to avoid certain organizational conflicts of interest; and (4) Clauses which provide for protection of confidential data and guardagainst its unauthorized use. <ITAG tagnum="80">2009.570-6</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Evaluation, findings, and contract award. </ITAG>The contracting officer shall evaluate all relevant facts submitted byan offeror under the representation requirements of 2009.570-4(b) and otherrelevant information.

This acquisition method refers to the competitive selection ofbasic or applied research proposals resulting from a BAA published in theCommerce Business Daily (CBD). The publication of the BAA in the CBD satisfiesthe FAR requirement for full and open competition. A primary benefit ofthe BAA is the ability to make multiple awards on the basis of one announcementwhich reduces the procurement lead-time and the staff effort involved ininitiating several competitive projects. It also provides flexibility insource selection, based on the merits of the individual proposal(s). (b) The BAA is an efficient means of soliciting competitive basic or appliedresearch ``ideas.'' BAAs may be used to fulfill requirements for scientificstudy and experimentation directed toward advancing the state-of-the-art,or increasing knowledge or understanding rather than focusing on a specificsystem or hardware solution. The BAA technique may only be used when meaningfulproposals with varying technical/scientific approaches can be reasonablyanticipated. (1) The BAA consists of the following: (i) A description of the agency's research interest, either for an individualprogram requirement or for broadly defined areas of interest covering thefull range of the agency's requirements; (ii) A description of the criteria for selecting the proposals, their relativeimportance and the method of evaluation; (iii) A specification of the period of time during which propossls submittedin response to the BAA will be accepted; and (iv) Instructions for the preparation and submission of proposals. (2) Proposals received as a result of the BAA must be evaluated in accordancewith evalution criteria specified in the announcement by a peer or scientificreview group established by the Designating Official. The BAA evaluationcriteria should include ``scientific merit'' and should describe the methodthat will be used for evaluating proposals. Written evaluation reportson individual proposals are necessary, but proposals will not be evaluatedagainst each other since they are not submitted in accordance with a commonwork statement. Criteria for selecting contractors will include such factorsas: (i) Unique and innovative methods, approaches, or concepts demonstratedby the proposal. (ii) Overall scientific, technical, or socio-economic merits of the proposal.(iii) The offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques,or unique combinations of these which are integral factors for achievingthe proposal objectives. (iv) The qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the proposed principalinvestigator, team leader, or key personnel who are critical in achievingthe proposal objectives. (v) Potential contribution of the effort to NRC's mission. (vi) Overall standing among similar proposals available for evaluationand/or evaluation against the known state-of-the-art. (3) Once a proposal is received, communication between the agency's scientificor engineering personnel and the principal investigator is permitted forclarification purposes only and must be coordinated through the Divisionof Contracts and Property Management.(c) After evaluation of the proposals, the Designating Official shall submita comprehensive evaluation report to the contracting officer which recommendsthe source(s) for contract award.
