The temperaturerange for interlayer water loss by smectite under differential-pressureconditions is approximately coincident with the beginning of the smectite-to-illitetransformation and hydrocarbon generation. The model presented assumesthe effects of pore fluid composition and 2:1 layer with decreasing interlayerwater content, increasing pressure and temperature, and changing pore-fluidchemistry may be important in initiating clay and organic matter transformations.Changes in clay stability with interlayer water loss may also be responsiblefor the different rates of smectite-to-illite transformation observedin interbedded sandstones and shales. 8 figures, 3 tables.</TEXT></DOC>
