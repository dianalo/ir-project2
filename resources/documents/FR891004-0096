Background </ITAG>Pursuant to Public Law (P.L.) 97-415, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission(the Commission) is publishing this regular biweekly notice. P.L. 97-415revised section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act),to require the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued, orproposed to be issued, under a new provision of section 189 of the Act.This provision grants the Commission the authority to issue and make immediatelyeffective any amendment to an operating license upon a determination bythe Commission that such amendment involves no significant hazards consideration,notwithstanding the pendency before the Commission of a request for a hearingfrom any person. This biweekly notice includes all notices of amendments issued, or proposedto be issued from September 11, 1989 through September 22, 1989. The lastbiweekly notice was published on September 20, 1989 (54 FR 38759). <ITAG tagnum="84">NOTICE OF CONSIDERATION OF ISSUANCE OF AMENDMENT TO FACILITY OPERATINGLICENSE AND PROPOSED NO SIGNIFICANT HAZARDS CONSIDERATION DETERMINATIONAND OPPORTUNITY FOR HEARING </ITAG>The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following amendmentrequests involve no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission'sregulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facilityin accordance with the proposed amendments would not (1) involve a significantincrease in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated;or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reductionin a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed determination for eachamendment request is shown below. The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination.Any comments received within 30 days after the date of publication of thisnotice will be considered in making any final determination. The Commissionwill not normally make a final determination unless it receives a requestfor a hearing. Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Regulatory PublicationsBranch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Officeof Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,and should cite the publication date and page number of this <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice. Written comments may also be deliveredto Room P-223, Phillips Building, 7920 Norfolk Avenue, Bethesda, Marylandfrom 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Copies of written comments received may beexamined at the NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street,NW., Washington, DC The filing of requests for hearing and petitions forleave to intervene is discussed below. By November 3, 1989, the licensee may file a request for a hearing withrespect to issuance of the amendment to the subject facility operatinglicense and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceedingand who wishes to participate as a party in the proceeding must file awritten petition for leave to intervene. Requests for a hearing and petitionsfor leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's``Rules of Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714 whichis available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building,2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555 and at the Local Public DocumentRoom for the particular facilities involved. If a request for a hearingor petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commissionor an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission orby the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will ruleon the request and/or petition and the Secretary or the designated AtomicSafety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriateorder. As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall setforth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding,and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding.The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention shouldbe permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) thenature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to theproceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial,or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of anyorder which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest.The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subjectmatter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Anyperson who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has beenadmitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave ofthe Board up to fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfythe specificity requirements described above. Not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to thepetition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions whichare sought to be litigated in the matter. Each contention must consistof a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the basesof the contention and a concise statement of the alleged facts or expertopinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intendsto rely in proving the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must alsoprovide references to those specific sources and documents of which thepetitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establishthose facts or expert opinion. Petitioner must provide sufficient informationto show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a materialissue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within thescope of the amendments under consideration. The contention must be onewhich, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitionerwho fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirementswith respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participateas a party. Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subjectto any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have theopportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, includingthe opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determinationon the issue of no significant hazards consideration. The final determinationwill serve to decide when the hearing is held. If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significanthazards consideration, the Commission may issue the amendment and makeit immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Anyhearing held would take place after issuance of the amendment. If the final determination is that the amendment involves a significanthazards consideration, any hearing held would take place before the issuanceof any amendment. Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expirationof the 30-day notice period. However, should circumstances change duringthenotice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result,for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission mayissue the license amendment before the expiration of the 30-day noticeperiod, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involvesno significant hazards consideration. The final determination will considerall public and State comments received before action is taken. Should theCommission take this action, it will publish a notice of issuance and providefor opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects thatthe need to take this action will occur very infrequently. A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filedwith the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Service Branch, or may bedelivered to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building,2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC, by the above date. Where petitionsare filed during the last ten (10) days of the notice period, it is requestedthat the petitioner promptly so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephonecall to Western Union at 1-(800) 325-6000 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700).The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number3737 and the following message addressed to (<T3>Project Director</T3>): petitioner's name and telephone number; datepetition was mailed; plant name; and publication date and page number ofthis <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice. A copy of the petition should also besent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee. Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions,supplemental petitions and/or requests for hearing will not be entertainedabsent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or thepresiding Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, that the petition and/or requestshould be granted based upon a balancing of factors specified in 10 CFR2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d). For further details with respect to this action, see the application foramendment which is available for public inspection at the Commission'sPublic Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,DC, and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved.<ITAG tagnum="84">Arkansas Power andamp; Light Company, Docket No. 50-368, Arkansas NuclearOne, Unit 2, Pope County, Arkansas </ITAG><T3>Date of amendment request: </T3>August 22, 1989 <T3>Description of amendment request: </T3>The amendment would change theallowable minimum setpoint value on the Pressurizer Code Safety Valvesas specified in Technical Specification (TS) 3.4.2 and 3.4.3 from 1% to3%. It would also change the minimum setpoint value for the Main SteamLine Code Safety Valves from 1% to 3% as specified in Technical SpecificationTable 3.7-5. Under these TS revisions, if the setpoint for either typeof safety valve was found outside a 271% tolerance band, the setpoint wouldbe adjusted to within 271% of the lift setting specified in the TS. The change would allow more flexibility during plant operation and wouldresult in reduced worker radiological exposure associated with valve testingand setpoint adjustment. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards in 10 CFR 50.92(c) for determiningwhether a significant hazards consideration exists. A proposed amendmentto a operating license for a facility involves no significant hazards considerationif operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendmentwould: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof a accident previously evaluated, (2) Create the possibility of a newor different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated, or(3) Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. Arkansas Powerand Light Company (APandamp;L) has reviewed the proposed change and has determinedthat it involves no significant hazards considerations, in that operationof the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not: <ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Criterion 1 - Involve a Significant Increase in the Probability orConsequences of an Accident Previously Evaluated </T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed change does not affect previously analyzed events orany parameters associated with plant operations. Although a decrease inthe Main Steam Line Code Safety Valves lift settings of 3% may affect theautomatic transfer to post-trip secondary pressure control to the TurbineDump and Bypass System (TDBS), previously analyzed events have conservativelynot taken credit for operation of the TDBS. The primary and secondary coolantoverpressure limits are not changed by this proposed amendment since theupper limits of pressure will be maintained at +1%. Furthermore, duringtesting, the valves will be adjusted to be within the currently required271% tolerance. Therefore, the proposed changes have no impact on the safetyanalyses presented in the Safety Analysis Report and the probability orconsequences of previously evaluated accidents would not be increased.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Criterion 2 - Create the Possibility of a New or Different Kind ofAccident from any Previously Evaluated </T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed change does not introduce a new mode of plant operation.The safety valves will continue to function per their design and a 3% decreasein a lift setting will remain significantly above normal system operatingpressures. Since no hardware modifications or changes in operating procedureswill be made, the proposed changes would not create the possibility ofa new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Criterion 3 - Involve a Significant Reduction in a Margin of Safety</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The safety margin is controlled by the upper tolerance limit, whichis not changed. The lift settings will continue to be set within 1% ofsetpoint and with an ``as-found'' tolerance of +1%, -3%, the safety functionof the setpoint is not altered. The system capabilities to mitigate and/orprevent accidents will be the same as they were prior to these changes.Thus, the proposed changes would not involve a reduction in a margin ofsafety.</ITAG>The staff has reviewed APandamp;L's no significant hazards considerationdetermination analysis and agrees with its conclusion.

Thenew methodology was published in Revision 2 of Regulatory Guide 1.99 (RG1.99), ``Radiation Embrittlement of Reactor Vessel Materials.'' GenericLetter 88-11 requested an evaluation and schedule for the implementationof the RG 1.99, Revision 2 changes to the Technical Specifications (TS).This amendment request incorporates the changes of the new methodologyinto the Shearon Harris Nuclear Power Plant, Unit 1, (Harris) TS. The revisionsaffect the pressure-temperature limitations on the Reactor Coolant System(RCS), the heatup and cooldown rates for the RCS, and the associated LowTemperature Overpressure Protection System (LTOP) set points. In addition,the new methodology requires related changes in (1) recalculated limitingmaterial reference temperature (RT sub-NDT), (2) modified LTOP enable temperature,(3) the selection of instrumentation for monitoring RCS average temperatureand (4) revisions to the TS Bases. Finally, some administrative changesare requested such as: (1) rewording to clarify certain specifications,(2) delete redundant surveillances, and (3) removal of the reference tocriticality limits in TS 3.4.9.1, 3.4.9.2 and Figure 3.4-3. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards in 10 CFR 50.92(c) for determiningwhether a significant hazards consideration exists. A proposed amendmentto an Operating License for a facility involves no significant hazardsconsideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposedamendment would not: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probabilityof consequences of an accident previously evaluated, or (2) Create thepossibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previouslyevaluated, or (3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided the followingno significant hazards consideration determination: <ITAG tagnum="21">1. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increasein the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluatedas described below. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(a) Technical Specifications 3.4.9.1 and 3.4.9.2 ``REACTOR COOLANTSYSTEM PRESSURE/TEMPERATURE LIMITS'' provide RCS pressure-temperature limitsto protect the reactor pressure vessel from brittle fracture by clearlyseparating the region of normal operations from the region where the vesselis subject to brittle fracture. The heatup and cooldown rates of Specifications3.4.9.1 and 3.4.9.2, and LTOP setpoints in Specification 3.4.9.4 are designedto ensure that the RCS pressure-temperature limits are not exceeded duringany condition of normal operation, including anticipated operational occurrences,and system hydrostatic tests. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 50 Appendix G, ``FractureToughness Requirements,'' and Appendix H, ``Reactor Vessel Material SurveillanceProgram Requirements,'' require the calculation of changes in the fracturetoughness of reactor vessel materials caused by neutron radiation throughoutthe service life of nuclear reactors. The `change' is used in conjunctionwith the initial material reference temperature (RT<T2>NDT</T2>) to establish the limiting pressure-temperature curves. RegulatoryGuide 1.99 contains procedures for calculating the effects of neutron radiationembrittlement of the low-alloy steels currently used for light-water-cooledreactor vessels. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Revision 2 of the regulatory guide upgrades and expands the proceduresfor calculating vessel radiation embrittlement. Generally, Revision 2 methodsresult in a lowering of the Appendix G pressure-temperature curves. Byincreasing the margin between the region where the vessel may be subjectto brittle fracture and the region of acceptable operations, these morerestrictive curves ensure the continued safe operation of SHNPP by reducingthe probability of operation in a manner which may exceed the brittle fracturelimits of the reactor vessel. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The revised pressure-temperature curves required modification of theLTOP setpoints and the heatup and cooldown rates. Revised LTOP setpointsand heatup/cooldown rates were chosen to ensure that the existing marginwas maintained i.e., that given a limiting mass or heat input to the RCSduring normal operations, anticipated occurrences and system hydrostatictesting, the Appendix G pressure-temperature curves are not exceeded. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Therefore, the proposed amendments to the pressure-temperature limitations,the heatup and cooldown rates, the LTOP setpoints and the recalculatedinitial limiting material RT<T2>NDT</T2> do not involve a significant increase in the probability orconsequences of an accident previously evaluated because collectively theyimplement more accurate and restrictive protection to prevent brittle fractureof the reactor pressure vessel. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) The revised LTOP enable temperature does not significantly increasethe probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. LowTemperature Overpressure Protection of the RCS is required by TechnicalSpecification 3.4.9.4. LTOP is necessary at low temperature since operatorresponse to an RCS pressurization event may not successfully avoid exceedingthe RCS pressure-temperature limits. The Regulatory Analysis for Revision2 of Regulatory Guide 1.99 specified that LTOP is necessary at temperaturesbelow RT<T2>NDT</T2> + 90anddegrees;F. This corresponds to 296anddegrees;F for SHNPP.The SHNPP LTOP system is currently armed at 335anddegrees;F. A 10anddegrees;Flowering of the enable temperature would have no impact on the LTOP system'scapability to perform its automatic protection function at low temperaturessince LTOP is still armed above 296anddegrees;F. Therefore, the proposedLTOP enable temperature change does not involve a significant increasein the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(c) The change to Technical Specification Table 4.4-6 concerning thechoice of the instrumentation for monitoring RCS temperature provides theoperator with temperature information that more accurately characterizesthe vessel material temperature. It would be used to determine the appropriateheatup or cooldown rate for the RCS. Use of more accurate temperature informationwould have no adverse affect on the probability or consequences of previouslyevaluated accidents. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(d) The remaining changes, i.e., removal of criticality limits, specificationclarifications, and deleted redundant surveillance are administrative innature and therefore would have no impact on the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a newor different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This amendment does not introduce any new equipment, operating proceduresor constraints. This amendment either changes existing limits or incorporatesadminstrative changes. Therefore no new accident or malfunction is introducedby this amendment. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reductionin the margin of safety. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The margin of safety defined in the Technical Specification Basesis not reduced by the change, since restrictions remain in place to ensurethe operating limits of the reactor vessel are not challenged. The effectof the amendment is to implement more accurate and restrictive protectionfrom brittle fracture of the reactor pressure vessel and as such to enhancethe margin of safety.</ITAG>The licensee has concluded that the proposed amendment meets the threestandards in 10 CFR 50.92 and, therefore, involves no significant hazardsconsideration. The NRC staff has made a preliminary review of the licensee's no significanthazards consideration determination and agrees with the licensee's analysis.Accordingly, the Commission proposes to determine that the requested amendmentdoes not involve a significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Cameron Village RegionalLibrary, 1930 Clark Avenue, Raleigh, North Carolina 27605. <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>R.

The licensee has provided an analysis of no significant hazards considerationin this request for a license amendment. The licensee states that operationof LaSalle County Station Units 1 and 2, in accordance with the proposedamendment, will not: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences ofan accident previously evaluated because this change does not affect theoriginal system design of venting or purging the primary containment. Operationwith one valve closed assures primary containment integrity;(2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany accident previously evaluated because this change does not affect theoriginal system design or venting or purging the primary containment, whichis designed to have both valves in the containment penetration open; and(3) Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety because primarycontainment is still maintained with one of the two valves open in eachpenetration and the open valve is subject to closure by a primary containmentisolation signal.

The licensee has provided an analysis of no significant hazards considerationin its request for a license amendment. The licensee states that operationof LaSalle County Station, Units 1 and 2, in accordance with the proposedamendment will not: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences onan accident previously evaluated because the Updated Final Safety AnalysisReport (UFSAR) provides the safety analysis for inadvertent main steamisolation valve (MSIV) closure. Main steam tunnel (MST) temperature tripsare a potential cause of spurious MSIV closures; therefore, by removingthe temperature trips, the risk of an inadvertent MSIV closure will bereduced. Additionally, the UFSAR safety analysis for steam system breakoutside of the containment assumes that a main steam line instantaneouslyand circumferentially breaks at a location downstream of the outermostisolation valve. Therefore, the analysis does not take into account theability to detect small steam leaks in the MST; (2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany accident previously evaluated because the safety evaluation in theUFSAR does not include an analysis of small steam leaks. The only analysisis for a catastropic failure of a main steam line which represents theenvelope evaluation of steam line failures outside of the containment;and (3) Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety because analysishas shown that the decrease in the margin of safety due to the removalof the MST temperature trips is insignificant. The small increase in riskto plant safety due to small steam line breaks which quickly propagateto large breaks is more than offset by the reduction in risk to plant safetyposed by the challenges to plant systems caused by the spurious MSIV closures.The staff has reviewed the licensee's evaluation of the proposed amendmentand agrees with the licensee's conclusion.

According to 10 CFR50.92(c), a proposed amendment to an operating license involves no significanthazards considerations if operation of the facility in accordance withthe proposed amendment would not: 1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences ofan accident previously evaluated; or 2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from anyaccident previously evaluated; or 3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposed revision to the TS is in accordance with the guidance providedin Generic Letter 88-16 for licensees requesting removal of the valuesof cycle-specific parameter limits from TS. The establishment of theselimits in accordance to an NRC-approved methodology and the incorporationof these limits into the Core Operating Limits Report will ensure thatproper steps have been taken to establish the values of these limits. The licensee has provided an analysis of no significant hazards considerationin its request for a license amendment. The licensee states that operationof LaSalle County Station Units 1 and 2, in accordance with the proposedamendments, will not: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probability of consequences ofany accident previously evaluated because no plant protective functionsare changed by this amendment. The amendment is essentially administrativein nature by removing cycle-specific and fuel bundle type specific powerdistribution limits from the TS and placing them in a separate controlleddocument, the Core Operating Limits Report (COLR). The MCPR and MAPLHGRBases section changes are also administrative. NRC approved methods willstill be used to analyze reloads of NRC-approved fuel types to determinethe results reported in the COLR in accordance with TS. The surveillancerequirements for these power distribution limits remain unchanged. Additionally,previously analysed accidents are also not affected by the proposed changesto the fuel assemblies and control rod assemblies sections of the designfeatures, since the changes do no allow the use of any types of fuel assembliesand control rod assemblies that have not been previously evaluated foruse in the reactor core. These changes are being made to eliminate thedesign characteristics from the Technical Specifications since this informationis fuel assembly and control rod assembly specific. Use of new types offuel assemblies and control and rod assemblies is evaluated in accordancewith 10 CFR 50.92 and 10 CFR 50.59; (2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany accident previously evaluated because it will not result in changesin the operating mode or configuration of the reactor core or any plantcomponents; thus the change does not create any new accident type. Thecurrent spectrum of reactor transients and accident analyzed remains unchanged.The proposed change to the fuel assemblies and control rod assemblies sectionsof the design features does not allow the use of any types of fuel assembliesand control rod assemblies that have not been previously evaluated foruse in the reactor core; thus the change does not create any new or differentaccident mode. The current spectrum of reactor transient and accident analysesremain unchanged. As new designs are developed, appropriate reviews willbe conducted as required by 10 CFR 50.92 and 10 CFR 50.59 to ensure nonew or different kind of accident scenario is created; and (3) Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety because themethods for determining fuel/core limits are not affected by this change.No revisions in the parameters required to verify operation with existingsafety bases are involved (i.e., LHGR, MCPR and MAPLHGR are still the limits).No safety limits are changed. The change only removes cycle-speific andfuel bundle type specific power distribution limits from the TS and incorporatesthese limits into COLR. The plant will continue to be operated under thesesame power distribution limits, which will be calculated using NRC-approvedmethods. The MCPR and MAPLHGR Bases section changes are administrativeand therefore no impact on margin of safety. The proposed change to thefuel assemblies and control rod assemblies section of the design featuresdoes not allow the use of any types of fuel assemblies and control rodassemblies that have not been previously evaluated for use in the reactorcore. Any new type of fuel assemblies and control rod assemblies will beevaluated before use in the reactor core. This change only removes specificdesign characteristics of the fuel assemblies and control rod assembliesfrom the TS and does not impact any current Limiting Condition for Operationor Surveillance Requirements. The staff has reviewed the licensee's evaluation of the proposed amendmentand agrees with the licensee's conclusion. Therefore, the staff proposesto determine that the proposed change to the Technical Specifications doesnot involve significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Public Library of IllinoisValley Community College, Rural Route No. 1, Ogelsby, Illinois 61348. <T3>Attorney to licensee: </T3>Michael I.

This signal was not credited in any FSAR Chapter15 accident analysis for its trip function. In those analyses, the slower-respondinglow level trip was conservatively credited with causing reactor trip whenthe accidents occur. Elimination of this function would yield the benefit of reduced challengesto plant safety systems. Plant safety could be enhanced when challengesto safety systems are reduced. In addition, surveillance/maintenance workneeded for the Reactor Protection System would be lowered, resulting inreduced possibility of system interaction. The requested amendment is similarto one granted to Prairie Island Nuclear Power Station.<T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists in accordance with 10 CFR 50.92(c). A proposedamendment to an operating license for a facility involves no significanthazard consideration if operation of the facility in accordance with theproposed amendment would not (1) Involve a significant increase in theprobability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated, (2) Createthe possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accidentpreviously evaluated, or (3) Involve a significant reduction in a marginof safety. As stated above, the subject trip function was not credited in any safetyanalysis; its elimination would not involve any change to any previousanalysis. Furthermore, its functioning or failure was not considered aprecursor to any accident. Hence the answer to the first criterion is negative.No new equipment or system would be provided as a result of the amendment.Hence the answer to the second criterion is also negative. No previous analytical assumptions would be changed and no acceptance criterionwould be relaxed.

The licensee has proposed that the above license conditions be deletedin that their subject provisions have been satisfied. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>On January 31, 1986, the NRC staff issued Facility Operating LicenseNo. NPF-49 to Northeast Nuclear Energy Company, et. al. (the licensee)for operation of Millstone Unit No. 3. As part of NPF-49, the NRC specifiedthat certain actions, ``License Conditions,'' were to be undertaken bythe licensee. The license condition numbers correspond to sections withinNPF-49. The satisfaction of these license condition is described below.<T3>1. License Condition 2.C(3)--Containment Average Temperature </T3>License Condition 2.C(3) in the Millstone Unit No. 3 Operating Licenserequires that ``Prior to start-up following the first refueling outage,the qualified life of electrical equipment within the scope of 10 CFR 50.49located inside containment shall be recalculated based on the actual temperaturemonitored inside containment during the first cycle of operation.'' Ina letter dated October 3, 1988, the NRC concluded that License Condition2.C(3) had been met. <T3>2. 2.C(4)--N-1 Loop Operation </T3>License Condition 2.C(4) in the Millstone Unit No. 3 operating licenseprohibits three-loop operations until outstanding issues are resolved tothe satisfaction of the NRC Staff. The NRC reviewed information presentedby the licensee and concluded in a letter dated November 16, 1987 thatthe Staff's concerns were satisfied and the license condition was met.<T3>3. 2.C(6)--Instrumentation for Monitoring Post-Accident ConditionsR.G. 1.97, Revision 2 Requirements </T3>License Condition 2.C(6) requires that ``NNECO shall install and have operationalinstrumentation to monitor containment sump water temperature at the firstscheduled outage of sufficient duration after procurement is complete,but no later than start-up after the first refueling outage.'' In a letterdated October 21, 1987, the NRC informed NNECO that the Staff is currentlygenerically reviewing the need for Category 2 instrumentation to monitorthe containment sump water temperature, and the use of Category 3 instrumentationwas acceptable for operation while their review is ongoing. In addition,the Staff concluded that License Condition 2.C(6) was satisfied. <T3>4. 2.C(8)--Mositure in Air Start System </T3>License Condition 2.C(8) requires that ``NNECO shall install air dryersin the emergency diesel air start system at the first scheduled outageof sufficient duration after procurement is completed, but no later thanstart-up after the first refueling outage.'' In response to this licensecondition, air drying skids were installed in each emergency diesel generatorstarting air system and made operational during the first refueling outage.In a letter dated January 21, 1988, NNECO confirmed the completion of actionsto satisfy License Conditon 2.C(8). <T3>5. 2.C(9)--Operating Staff Experience Requirements </T3>License Condition 2.C(9) specifies that each operating shift shall havea licensed senior operator or an advisor who had certain experience inthe operation of facilities similar to Millstone Unit No. 3. In a letterdated July 9, 1986, the NRC confirmed that NNECO met license condition2.C(9). <T3>6. 2.C(11)--Revised Small Break LOCA Methods to Show Compliance With10 CFR 50.46, TMI Item II.K.3.31 </T3>License Conditon 2.C(11) required plant-specific analysis using NOTRUMPor a generic submittal referencing NOTRUMP. In a letter dated January 13,1987, the NRC indicated that the Staff has reviewed WCAP 22245 and theinformation submitted in the licensee's letter dated June 6, 1986, andconcluded that License Condition 2.C(11) had been met. <T3>7. 2.C(12)--SPDS </T3>License Condition 2.C(12) required that ``Prior to restart following thefirst refueling outage, NNECO shall add to the Safety Parameter DisplaySystem (SPDS) and have operational the following SPDS parameters: (i) Residual Heat Removal (RHR) flow'' (ii) Containment Isolation (iii) Containment Hydrogen Concentration (iv) Primary Coolant System Hot Leg Temperature In a letter dated March 7, 1988, the NRC staff concluded that license condition2.C(12) had been satisfied. <T3>8. 2.C(13)--Detailed Control Room Design Review </T3>License Condition 2.C(13) required that ``NNECO shall correct all humanengineering discrepancies (HEDs) not resolved prior to exceeding 5 percentpower, and according to the schedule specified in a letter from J. F. Opekato V. S. Noonan dated January 29, 1986.'' In a letter dated January 13,1987, the NRC concluded that License Condition 2.C(13) of the MillstoneUnit No. 3 operating license had been satisfied. As can be seen from the above, each license condition has been satisfiedby the licensee. Title 10, CFR 50.92, ``Issuance of Amendment,'' contains standards foraddressing the existence of no significant hazards considerations withregard to issuance of license amendments. The licensee has addressed thestandards of 10 CFR 50.92, with regard to the proposed changes to the licenseassociated with the August 14, 1989 application, as follows: <ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed changes do not involve a significant hazards considerationbecause the changes would not: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously analyzed. Individual license conditions discussedabove were one-time commitments that have been met. Their existence isno longer warranted; therefore, removal of license conditions is appropriateand safe. As a result of theproposed amendment, there are no physical changesto the facility and all operating procedures, limiting conditions for operation(LCO), limiting safety system settings, and safety limits specified inthe Technical Specifications will remain unchanged. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany previously evaluated. Since there are no changes in the way the plantis operated, the potential for an unanalyzed accident is not created. Nonew failure modes are introduced. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. Plant safetymargins are established through LCO, limiting safety system settings, andsafety limits specified in the Technical Specifications. As a result ofthe proposed amendment, there will be no changes to either the physicaldesign of the plant or to any of these settings and limits; therefore,there will be no changes to any of the margins of safety. </ITAG>The NRC staff has reviewed, and concurs in, the licensee's statement regarding``no significant hazards considerations'' associated with the August 14,1989 application for license amendment. Accordingly, the staff has made a proposed determination that the applicationfor amendment, dated August 14, 1989, involves no significant hazards consideration.<T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Waterford Public Library,49 Rope Ferry Road, Waterford, Connecticut 06385. <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Gerald Garfield, Esquire, Day, Berry andamp;Howard, City Place, Hartford, Connecticut 06103-3499. <T3>NRC Project Director: </T3>John F.

The correct reference in TS 3.3.3.7 should be TS 4.6.1.5rather than TS 4.6.1.6. The purpose of TS 4.6.1.5 is to allow containmenttemperature to be monitored in the event of a malfunction of the fire detectionsystem. Section 4.6.1.6 deals with structural integrity and is incorrectlyreferenced under the existing TS 3.3.3.7. On March 6, 1986, the NRC staff published, in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(51 FR 7744) examples of Amendments that arenot likely to involve significant hazards considerations. Example (i) involves,``A purely administrative change to technical specifications: for example,a change to achieve consistency throughout the technical specifications,correction of an error, or a change in nomenclature.'' Since the proposedchange to TS 3.3.3.7 would correct an error, the NRC staff proposes todetermine that the change involves no significant hazards considerations.The licensee has also proposed a change to TS 4.3.3.7.1. At the presenttime, TS 4.3.3.7.1 allows the licensee to delay the operational test forfire detectors, which are not accessible during plant operation, untilthe next cold shutdown exceeding 24 hours. The licensee has proposed thatTS 4.3.3.7.1 be clarified by the addition of a footnote which identifiesinaccessible fire detectors to include, ``...detectors in the Reactor Containment,HIGH Radiation Areas, and areas contaiminated in excess of 100,000 dpmper 100 cm2.'' Finally, the licensee has proposed a change to TS Table 3.3-11. The proposedchanges would correct inconsistencies between the TS and the actual locationand numbers of fire detectors at Millstone Unit 3. Title 10, CFR 50.92,``Issuance of Amendment,'' contains standards for addressing the existenceof no significant hazards considerations with regard to issuance of licenseamendments. In this regard, the proposed addition of the footnote to TS4.3.3.7.1 and the changes to TS Table 3.3-11 would not involve a significanthazards consideration because the changes would not: 1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences ofan accident previously analyzed. The proposed changes to the TS do notin any way change the existing fire hazards analysis and thus no changesto probability or consequences of fires are involved. 2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from anypreviously analyzed. The changes do not alter the way the plant is operatedor any changes in plant equipment. The changes do not introduce new failuremodes. For these reasons, the changes do not have the potential to createa new type of accident from that previously analyzed. 3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. Since no newsafety analyses, plant equipment, or operational modes are associated withthe proposed changes to the TS, no safety margins are reduced. Based upon the above, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the proposedaddition of the footnote to TS 4.3.3.7.1 and the proposed changes to TSTable 3.3-11 involve no significant hazards considerations. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Waterford Public Library,49 Rope Ferry Road, Waterford, Connecticut 06385. <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Gerald Garfield, Esquire, Day, Berry andamp;Howard, City Place, Hartford, Connecticut 06103-3499. <T3>NRC Project Director: </T3>John F.

This surveydetermined that excessive amounts of unfiltered air were being pulled intothe control room envelope, and calculations performed by the licensee indicatethat these amounts of unfiltered air would result in operators receivingmore than the 30 REM thyroid dose limit allowed in a 30 day post accidentperiod. The licensee has taken interim measures to protect the operatorswhile the Control Room Air Treatment System was being evaluated and whilethe modifications are being incorporated into the design to rectify theproblem. The licensee's design modifications are to replace the existing single,90% efficient charcoal filter unit with two full capacity 99% efficientfilter trains. Calculations using these new filter trains indicate thatthe exposure is reduced and meets the GDC 19 dose limits from the combinationof all sources of airborne radiation to the operators in the control room.In addition, the installation of the additional charcoal filters will introducean increased fire load in room (Room 81) where these charcoal filters arelocated. The filters are equipped with fire detection and deluge systemsthat are designed to alert operators and extinguish any fires without relianceon existing fire protection equipment in the area. Therefore, two new firezones are being added to the Technical Specifications as a result of thismodification to the fire system. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c).

Therefore, the fire detection and suppressioncapabilities for the plant will not be degraded, and the consequences ofan accident previously evaluated will not be increased. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dose calculations show that the new filter system will prevent theoperators from exceeding the 10 CFR 50 Appendix A GDC 19 dose limits fromthe combination of all sources of airborne radioactive iodine. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The consequences of an accident previously analyzed will not be increasedbecause the testing requirements are being increased, resulting in a moreefficient filter thus lowering the doses in the control room. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2.

TSBases 3/4.7.1.1, ``Safety Valves,'' would be revised to reference the correctsecondary system design pressure and overpressure limit. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a nosignificant hazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c).A proposed amendment to an operating license involves no significant hazardsconsideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposedamendment will not: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) Create thepossibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previouslyevaluated; or (3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.The licensee, in its submittal of September 6, 1989, evaluated the proposedchanges against the significant hazards criteria of 10 CFR 50.92 and againstthe Commission guidance concerning application of this standard. Basedon the evaluation given below, the licensee has concluded that the proposedchanges do not involve a significant hazards consideration. The licensee'sevaluation is as follows: <ITAG tagnum="21">a. Does the change involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated? </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The pressurizer and main steam line safety valves are designed tomitigate transients by preventing overpressurization of the RCS and MSS.The proposed change does not alter this design basis. The revised analysisshows that the probability or consequences of all previously analyzed accidentsare not changed by increasing the setpoint tolerance of the safety valves.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a significant increasein the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. Does the change create the possibility of a new or different kindof accident from any accident previously evaluated? </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">There is no physical alteration to any plant system, nor is therea change in the method in which any safety related system performs itsfunction. Any pressurizer safety valve lifting at the extremes of the proposedtolerance will not result in a low lift setpoint that is less than thepressurizer high pressure reactor trip or a high lift setpoint that allowsRCS overpressurization. Any main steam safety valve lifting at the extremesof the proposed tolerance will not result in a low lift setpoint that isless than the normal ``no load'' system pressure or a high lift setpointthat allows MSS overpressurization. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Therefore, the proposed change does not create the possibility ofa new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. Does the change involve a significant reduction in a margin ofsafety? </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">With the increased setpoint tolerances, the pressurizer and main steamline safety valves will still prevent pressure from exceeding 110 percentof design pressure in accordance with the ASME code. All conclusions forthe FSAR Update accident analyses are not affected by the change and remainvalid. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant reductionin a margin of safety. </ITAG>The NRC Staff has reviewed the proposed changes and the licensee's no significanthazards consideration determination and finds them acceptable. Therefore,the Staff proposes to determine that these changes do not involve significanthazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>California Polytechnic StateUniversity Library, Government Documents and Maps Department, San LuisObispo, California 93407. <T3>Attorneys for licensee: </T3>Richard R.

The Limerick Unit 1 TS presently allow reduction of the minimumSRM count rate required for control rod withdrawal or core alterationsfrom the normal 3 counts per second (cps) to 0.7 cps as long as the signal-to-noiseratio is greater than or equal to two. General Electric Company (GE) hasadvised licensees that this provision is non-conservative with respectto the design bases of the SRM system, in that utilization of this provisioncould result in a reduction in counting certainty. In order to ensure thatthe design level of counting certainty is maintained, a change to the TSis proposed to incorporate a graph of SRM minimum count rate versus signal-to-noiseratio such that reduction of the count rate permitted by TS (3 cps to 0.8cps) is accompanied by a corresponding increase in the signal-to-noiseratio (2 to 30). Similar amendments were recently approved for Peach Bottom Units 2 and3 (Amendment Nos. 147 and 149 to Facility Operating License Nos. DPR-44and DPR-56 dated August 28, 1989). <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c). A proposed amendmentto an operating license involves no significant hazards consideration ifoperation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment wouldnot (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated (2) create the possibility of a newor different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated, or(3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The licensee has provided an analysis of no significant hazards considerationswith the request for the license amendment. The licensee's analysis ofthe proposed amendment against the three standards in 10 CFR 50.92 is reproducedbelow: <ITAG tagnum="21">A. The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in theprobability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed changes reduce the minimum SRM count rate required topermit core alterations during reactor refueling and withdrawal of controlrods during reactor startup. The proposed count rate is still within thedesign range of the SRM and specifying a signal-to-noise ratio assuresthe SRMs are responding to thermal neutron flux. No hardware changes arerequired to the SRM system, therefore malfunction of an SRM will stillproduce the required control rod withdrawal blocks. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The applicable accidents related to the proposed change are thoseinvolving SRMs during reactor startup (control rod drop accident (RDA)and continuous control rod withdrawal, and those involving SRMs duringreactor refueling (i.e., control rod removal error during refueling, asecond control rod removal or withdrawal, fuel insertion with the controlrod withdrawn, and a control rod removal without the fuel removed). Nocredit is taken for the SRMs in any of these accidents. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The RDA is the more limiting accident during reactor startup. Chapter15 (Section 15.4.9) of the FSAR assumes an initial condition of 10-8 ofrated power with the reactor critical in the analysis of transient coldconditions including the RDA. Therefore, reduction of the minimum SRM countrate required to permit withdrawal of control rods as shown in Figure 3.3.6-1still ensures that criticality will be achieved well above 10-8 of ratedpower. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Accordingly, this proposed change does not affect the probabilityof consequences of previously evaluated accidents. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The nuclear characteristics of the core assure that the reactor issubcritical even at its most reactive condition with the most reactivecontrol rod withdrawn during refueling. When the mode switch is in REFUEL,only one control rod can be withdrawn. Selection of a second control rodinitiates a control rod block, thereby preventing the withdrawal of morethan one control rod at a time. Therefore, the refueling interlocks preventany condition which could lead to inadvertent criticality due to a controlrod withdrawal error during refueling. Further, the mechanical design ofthe control rod, incorporating the velocity limiter, does not physicallypermit the upward removal of the control rod without the simultaneous orprior removal of the four adjacent fuel assemblies, thus eliminating anyhazardous condition. In addition,the refueling interlocks require thatall control rods must be fully inserted before a fuel assembly may be insertedinto the core. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">B. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new ordifferent kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">No hardware modifications are required to implement this change. Thedesign functions of the SRM system are not being changed. The only effectof this proposed change is a reduction in the minimum count rate requiredfor control rod withdrawal and reactor core alterations. The reduced minimumcount rate, which must be accompanied by a corresponding increase in signal-to-noiseratio, will continue to assure that all transients begin above 10-8 ofrated power, thereby maintaining the validity of the FSAR analysis. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">C. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction ina margin of safety. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The normal requirement of at least 3 cps assures that any transient,should it occur, begins at or above the initial value of 10-8 of ratedpower with the reactor critical as used in analysis of transient cold conditions.In fact, any observable neutron count rate on the SRM is sufficient toensure the analysis remains valid. Therefore, reduction of the minimumcount rate from 3 cps to the values shown in Figure 3.3.6-1 will not reducethis margin of safety because any transient will still begin at or above10-8 of rated power with the reactor critical. Further, the SRMs are notrequired to ensure the margin of safety as analyzed in Chapter 15 of theFSAR. </ITAG>The staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and agrees with it. Therefore,we conclude that the amendment satisfies the three criteria listed in 10CFR 50.92(c). Based on that conclusion, the staff proposes to make a ``nosignificant hazards'' determination. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Pottstown Public Library,500 High Street, Pottstown, Pennsylvania 19464. <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Conner and Wetterhahn, 1747 PennsylvaniaAvenue, NW., Washington, DC 20006 <T3>NRC Project Director: </T3>Walter R.

The licensee has evaluated the proposed amendment against the standardsof 10 CFR 50.92, and has determined the following: 1. This change does not involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The proposed change is organizational in nature and has no impact on Plantsystems or their overall performance in any manner that could lead to anaccident. The purpose of the change is to more effectively utilize thecompany resources for operating the Trojan Nuclear Plant. The probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated are not increased.2. This change does not create the possibility of a new or different kindof accident from any accident previously evaluated. As discussed above, the proposed change is organizational in nature, andhas no role in creating the possibility of any accidents. 3. This change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin ofsafety. As discussed above, the proposed change is organizational in nature andhas no impact on the accident analysis. Therefore, the margin of safetyis not affected. In the March 6, 1986 <T4>Federal Register </T4>(51 FR 7750), the NRC published a list of examplesof license amendments that are not likely to involve a significant hazardsconsideration. One of the examples is: ``A purely administrative changeto technical specifications, e.g., a change to achieve a consistency throughoutthe technical specifications, correction of an error, or a change in nomenclature.''The proposed change is similar to this example, inasmuch as the proposedchanges would (1) reflect the current organization and (2) achieve consistencyin the technical specifications. In addition, the staff has reviewed thelicensee's no significant hazards analysis and concurs with the licensee'sconclusions. Therefore, the staff proposes to determine that the requestedchanges do not involve a significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Portland State UniversityLibrary, 731 S.W.

The present wording states that the Average Power Range Monitor(APRM) rod blocks are not required in the start-up mode. This contradictsboth the body of Table 3.2-3 which indicates a separate trip level settingfor the APRM instrumentation in the start-up mode (less than or equal to12%) and Table 3.1-1, ``Reactor Protection System (SCRAM) InstrumentationRequirement,'' which requires that two APRM instrument channels per tripsystem must be operable in the startup mode. Therefore, the proposed changeto Note 1 would specify that the APRM Upscale (Start-up Mode) rod blockis required to be operable when the reactor is in the startup mode. Also,as further clarification, the proposed change to the note would indicatethat the APRM Upscale (Flow Biased) and the Downscale rod blocks are requiredto be operable when the reactor is in the run mode. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92.

The current sectionsrequire HPCI and RCIC to be operable at reactor pressures greater than122 psig. This change would bring the Browns Ferry Technical Specifications(TS) into conformance with the design capabilities of HPIC and RCIC asdefined in Chapters 6.3 and 14 of the Browns Ferry Final Safety AnalysesReport (FSAR). In addition, the proposed amendments would revise the applicablesurveillance (Sections 4.5.E.1.a and e, and 4.5.F.1.c and e) for thesetwo sections to read ``once/18 months'' rather than ``once/operating cycle.''An `operating cycle' at Browns Ferry is normally expected to be 18 monthsin duration. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided Standards for determining whether a significanthazards determination exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c). 10 CFR 50.91requires that at the time a licensee requests an amendment, it must provideto the Commission its analyses, using the standards in Section 50.92, onthe issue of no significant hazards consideration. Therefore, in accordancewith 10 CFR 50.91 and 10 CFR 50.92, the licensee has performed and providedthe following analysis: <ITAG tagnum="21">1. This proposed changes does not involve a significant increase inthe probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed amendment requires the HPCI/RCIC systems to be operablewhen reactor pressure is greater than 150 psig instead of 122 psig as currentlystated in the TS. Additionally, this amendment allows demonstrating HPCI/RCICoperability within 12 hours after sufficient reactor steam pressure becomesavailable during a cold startup. This revision brings the BFN TS into technicalagreement with the analyzed operating range and design specifications ofthe HPCI/RCIC systems. The HPCI and RCIC systems provide full design flowin the reactor pressure range of 150 to 1120 psig with their isolationsetpoints greater than 100 psig and greater than 50 psig reactor pressurerespectively. The shutoff head for the Core Spray System and RHR/LPCI are285 psig and 295 psig respectively. These low pressure coolant systemswill begin injecting flow into the vessel at approximately 230 psig andcontinue providing adequate core cooling down to zero reactor pressure.Thus, it can be seen that there is considerable overlap with the HPCI/RCICsystems and the low pressure CS/LPCI systems before cutoff of the highpressure systems below 150 psig. Therefore the high pressure systems arenot required to provide core cooling below 150 psig. Based on this, noadverse effects on safety are encountered in raising the operability requirementsof the HPCI/RCIC systems from 122 psig to 150 psig. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Since there is an overlap between the high pressure injection systemsand the low pressure injection systems, there is more than adequate corecooling capability to ensure that the reactor core remains covered as analyzedin the BFN Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR). With this overlap, allowingthe reactor pressure to be at or above 150 psig for twelve hours whiledemonstrating the HPCI/RCIC systems to be operable, will not increase theprobability or consequences of an accident as previously evaluated in theBFN FSAR. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Revising the surveillance requirements from once per operating cycleto once every 18 months provides consistency with other BFN TS, industrystandard practices, and NRC guidelines. Using the plus 25 percent allowedby TS, there could be a maximum of 22.5 months between surveillance tests.There are additional surveillance requirements that are performed at lesserfrequencies which demonstrate pump operability. The simulated automaticactuation test and the pump flow rate at 150 psig are tested once per 18months. The pump operability, and motor-operated valve operability aretested in accordance with ASME Section XI testing. In addition, the flowrate at normal reactor vessel operating pressure is tested once per 3 months.Performance of these tests provides adequate assurance that the HPCI/RCICsystems will perform their intended function. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">These proposed change do not involve any physical alteration of theplant or add any new equipment which could be the source of a malfunctionor accident. Based on the above, this proposed change does not involvea significant increase in the probability or consequence of an accidentpreviously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new ordifferent kind of accident from an accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed changes do not add any new equipment or require any existingequipment to operate outside its design specifications. Operating BFN underthe requirements of the proposed TS does not alter the function of anyinstrumentation, involve any type of modification to the plant, introducea new or different release pathway of any radioactive material to the environment,or create any new modes of operation that have not previously been analyzed.Implementation of this proposed change is consistent with and remains withinthe bounds of the BFN FSAR analysis. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. This proposed changes does not involve a significant reductionin a margin of safety. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As stated above, there is considerable overlap with the high pressureHPCI/RCIC systems and the low pressure CS/LPCI systems before cutoff ofthe high pressure systems below 150 psig reactor pressure. Therefore, HPCI/RCICare not required to provide core cooling below 150 psig. Consequently,there is no significant reduction in the margin of safety by raising theoperability requirements from 122 psig to 150 psig. In addition, the plant'soperating flexibility is enhanced by leaving in the option, that is currentlyin the TS, to demonstrate HPCI/RCIC operability with auxiliary steam. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Considering the low reactor pressure, the redundancy and availabilityof the low pressure systems during startup from a Cold Condition, twelvehours is a reasonable time to demonstrate HPCI/RCIC operability once steamof sufficient pressure is available. This relatively short time frame willnot create any significant increase in the risk associated with the unavailabilityof the HPCI/RCIC than has already been evaluated in the seven day out-of-servicetime that is typical industry practice. Therefore, it is concluded thatthere will be no significant reduction in the margin of safety due to implementingthese TS operability requirements. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Revising the surveillance frequency requirements is consistent withother BFN TS. BFN fuel is not designed to operate for 22.5 months at continuousfull power operation. Changing the surveillance requirements to once every18 months does not exceed the design limits nor change the intent of theexisting TS. </ITAG>The staff has reviewed the licensee's no significant hazards considerationsdetermination and agrees with the licensee's analysis.
