Determined to capitalize on the victory in the PersianGulf, some Pentagon brass are poised to launch a frontalassault on the defense-spending limits set last year. ArmySecretary Michael Stone disclosed in an interview that he andtop generals have drafted proposals to delay for at least ayear the deep troop reductions that are an integral part ofthe deficit-reduction package. Some congressional estimatesindicate that such a step could add as much as $30 billion toprojected defense spending in the next few years, though thePentagon's internal estimates are about $10 billion.</LP><TEXT>   Sen. Daniel Inouye, the Hawaii Democrat who heads theDefense Appropriations Subcommittee, is sympathetic. &quot;Ibelieve we should revisit the five-year {troop} strengthdecisions that we made,&quot; he says. That would likely meanbusting the defense-spending ceilings set last year.   That's something that White House National SecurityAdviser Brent Scowcroft seems willing to consider, althoughBudget Director Richard Darman is resisting -- for goodreason, says House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta.   The limits on defense spending are &quot;a very big thread,&quot;says the California Democrat. &quot;Once you pull it, it unwindsthe agreement.&quot; Democrats won't let defense spending climbwithout revisiting ceilings on domestic spending, he says.   The Pentagon isn't the only threat to thedeficit-reduction accord. For the past several weeks, some inCongress and the administration have been been testing theagreement's defenses, and have poked a few holes in wallsthat were supposed to contain government spending through1995.   Last year's agreement calls for reducing the projecteddeficit nearly $500 billion in five years. To do that, itrelies not only on the tax increases and benefit cutbackssigned into law, but on adherence to separate ceilings ondomestic, military and foreign-aid spending, and to rulesdesigned to limit new benefit programs.   As precise as the rules are, no one doubts the ability ofCongress and the White House to skirt them. &quot;None of thiswill be any more effective than the politicians are willingto make it,&quot; says Carol Cox, president of the business-fundedCommittee for a Responsible Federal Budget.   It's too soon to say whether President Bush and theleaders of Congress have the political will to stick to thefive-month-old agreement. But defenders of the law see sometroubling signs. Last week, for instance, Mr. Darman insistedpublicly that additional aid to Israel &quot;wouldn't qualify&quot; forthe exemption to the spending caps for the war. About to berun over by the Israel lobby's strength in Congress, theadministration changed its mind during the weekend. It nowsupports a spending bill for the war that includes $650million for Israel, all of it exempt from the spendingceilings.   The push to expand veterans benefits, even for those whoweren't involved in the war, could prove similarlyunstoppable -- even though the budget law says that any suchbenefit expansions should be offset with benefit cutselsewhere or tax increases. The &quot;emergency&quot; spending bill forthe war in the House includes $46 million in extra money forveterans' medical care -- exempt from the spending ceilings-- despite objections both from Mr. Darman and Mr. Panetta,who say there's no emergency to address. And if aid toveterans escapes the discipline of the budget law, aid tounemployed workers won't be far behind.   &quot;It's a week-to-week battle,&quot; says Rep. Panetta, whohelped negotiate the budget pact last year. &quot;Each week tellsyou a lot about whether you can hold onto it.&quot;   The most concerted challenge is coming from the Army,which stands to take the biggest hit if the current spendinglimits remain. Before Iraq invaded Kuwait, the Pentagon's&quot;downsizing&quot; plans envisioned axing nearly 250,000 soldiersand officers from the Army in a five-year period with a bigchunk of the cuts slated to come in the first years.   The first clear indication that some senior administrationofficials are itching to reopen the debate came during theweekend, when Mr. Scowcroft suggested in a nationallytelevised interview that &quot;a new look&quot; should be taken at thescope and pace of long-term defense cutbacks.   Gen. Carl Vuono, the Army's chief of staff, says theadministration's initial plan projected a &quot;bare minimum forceinto the mid-1990s,&quot; adding that &quot;it's only rational andprudent&quot; to revise those numbers upward in light of the warand Soviet instability. His boss, Secretary Stone, is moreblunt. The deep planned cuts &quot;are simply too much,&quot; he says,&quot;and we're going to hurt a lot of individuals&quot; who want tostay in uniform.   The plan Mr. Stone is pushing defers each annual incrementof the cutbacks to the next year. That would effectively givethe Army a cushion so it can meet the personnel targetslargely through reduced recruitment, and would allow it toavoid involuntarily retiring thousands of officers. Accordingto some Pentagon analyses, though, payroll and operatingcosts could rise as much as $10 billion in the five-yearperiod ending in 1996.   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, squeezed between themilitary's insistence for relief and the White House'soft-stated goal of reducing the deficit, is trying to walk afine line. His spokesman says &quot;no decision has been made&quot;about the Army's proposal. Mr. Cheney has asked Congress foradditional authority to transfer funds and determine trooplevels without detailed congressional oversight, and somePentagon aides say he may support portions of the Army'sproposal so long as weapons-procurement or other accounts arecut by a comparable amount.   The House Armed Services Committee passed a $15 billionsupplemental-spending bill for the Pentagon that, among otherthings, gives Mr. Cheney great flexibility in setting trooplevels through the end of the current fiscal year.   Although the biggest threat to the budget pact may be anall-out attack from the military, another risk is thatCongress and the White House will wink as spending ceilingsand enforcement rules are skirted.   The spending bills for the war may be the first example.Money may be tucked in for far more Patriot missiles thanwere fired in the war, as well as for such &quot;emergencies&quot; asadded Voice of America broadcasts and beefed-up security atthe Library of Congress. Another test could come later thisyear if the House sticks to a new rule that gives primacy tocongressional cost estimates -- not White House budget officefigures, as agreed previously -- in pricing new benefitprograms.   Even the administration is getting into the act, somecongressional budget analysts say. It has proposed addedspending for fiscal 1991 even though, by its own accounting,spending is already above the agreed-upon ceilings. The WhiteHouse budget office insists that it is simply takingadvantage of wiggle room the law provides.   The director of the Congressional Budget Office, RobertReischauer, is unconcerned about such small encroachments,compared with the possibility of changes in the defensenumbers. In fact, he says, &quot;maybe a few small leaks in thepressure chamber will reduce the danger of an explosion.&quot;   ---                   Pentagon Personnel                                                                                                          Defense Department manpower levels under the currentbudget                                                                                                        (In thousands of people)                                                                                                                              FY '92    FY '93    FY '94    FY '95                                                                                                        Active military                                                                                                          Army                   660       618       577       536   Marine Corps           188       182       176       171   Air Force              487       458       445       437                                                                                                        Total active           1,886     1,795     1,714     1,653                                                                                                        Selected reserves      1,068       989       924       906                                                                                                        Civilians              1,003       976       958       940                                                                                                          Source: Defense Department</TEXT></DOC>
