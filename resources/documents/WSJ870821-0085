Fed into their computers are five-year budget projections handed down by the Defense Department's top brass. These projections envision the military budget swelling from the current $282 billion to about $412 billion in fiscal 1992.    But the actual defense budget isn't likely to approach this level. Some of the Pentagon's strongest supporters in Congress foresee a rise to only about $350 billion by 1992, meaning that the department's assumed growth rates, which dictate planned production rates for more than 3,000 military programs, could be more than $150 billion out of whack for the five-year period.    The Pentagon's military planners are starting to gripe about it. &quot;For the last two years, the services have been given fiscal guidance that is junk,&quot; complains a Marine Corps officer in charge of planning certain high-cost programs. Like hundreds of other military planners, he knows he'll someday be told to throw away the plans he is working on and draw up new ones to meet the fiscal constraints imposed by a tight-fisted Congress. &quot;There's an enormous amount of lost motion because of the reprogramming that we have to do,&quot; says Vice Adm. David Jeremiah, who heads the Navy's planning office.    However, attempts to plan military programs at more likely funding levels have been squelched. Drawing up production schedules under less robust budget assumptions is regarded as defeatist rather than realistic.    An office in charge of buying Navy aircraft recently suggested such an approach and was chided by David Chu, the Pentagon's director of program analysis and evaluation. &quot;It is inappropriate to initiate action undercutting that budget,&quot; he said in a memorandum fired off earlier this month. &quot;Developing lower funding levels for naval aviation, at this time, would have exactly that effect.&quot;    Currently, the Pentagon's internal spending plan for the next five years is out of line not only with what Congress is likely to authorize but with President Reagan's own budget blueprint. Last January, the administration told Congress that it had scaled back its weapons-buying ambitions and that for the next five years it would seek growth of 3% a year, after inflation. However, the budget plan still used inside the department envisions this level of growth for only the next two fiscal years. Then, the heftier growth rates of the buildup would return for fiscal years 1990, 1991 and 1992, according to the internal projections.    &quot;It's institutional self-deception,&quot; says an Air Force budget analyst who asked to remain anonymous.    Under any interpretation, the Pentagon's long-range plans show an institution that appears bent on living beyond its means. Even if Congress were to provide full funding for the 3%-a-year growth plan the administration called for, the Pentagon would be $77.2 billion short of funds needed to carry out its five-year plan. Moreover, that assumes the most optimistic funding scenario. Under the more likely outcome that Congress allows the defense budget to grow at a rate equal to the rate of inflation, the Pentagon's five-year plan could be as much as $230 billion too high.    But even that may be too optimistic. The congressional budget committees appear determined to keep the defense budget flat. If that pattern holds for the next five years, the Pentagon's arms-buying plans would need about $400 billion more than Congress seems willing to give.    &quot;The next president is going to inherit this defense situation, and there'll be weeping and gnashing of teeth,&quot; predicts Lawrence Korb, assistant defense secretary during the first Reagan term and currently dean of the Graduate School for Public and International Affairs at the University of Pittsburgh.    Robert Helm, the Defense Department's comptroller, says the big numbers in the Pentagon's plans shouldn't cause such anxiety. &quot;It's not a budget; it's a planning tool,&quot; he says. &quot;It must be readjusted every year when we finally see what Congress gives us.&quot;    However, the adjustment process is getting more chaotic each year as the gap between Pentagon plans and congressional appropriations widens. &quot;People at the last minute force 10 pounds into a five-pound bag,&quot; says Mr. Korb. Painless cuts stemming from lower-than-expected inflation and reduced fuel costs have been largely used up. Michael Burns of Business Executives for National Security, a private watchdog group, expects many of the cuts to come out of budgets for training, ammunition and spare parts. &quot;We'll have a readiness and sustainability slump worse than anything we saw in the Carter years,&quot; he predicts.    Often the costs of weapons rise as the Pentagon scales back its purchasing plans. For example, budget cuts for fiscal 1988 forced the Army to drop its request for M-1 tanks to 600 from 815 this fiscal year. The cut drove up the price of each tank to $2.6 million from $2.3 million. The Navy pushed up the cost of each F-18 aircraft when it chopped its request for fiscal 1989 to 72 planes at $32.5 million apiece from 84 planes at $30.7 million each in fiscal 1988.    Sticking with budget wishes others consider unrealistic has long been a hallmark of Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger's political strategy of refusing to give ground early in a struggle. During the debate surrounding the fiscal 1988 budget, he remarked to a reporter, &quot;If you were realistic, you would never have realized as much military strength as we have gained since 1981.&quot;    &quot;He will not let people begin to plan for what we're likely to get because he thinks it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy,&quot; says Mr. Korb. However, some lawmakers are perplexed that the internal plan doesn't even match the official administration budget projections. Sen. Lowell Weicker (R., Conn.) has charged that &quot;the Pentagon continues to keep two sets of books.&quot; Frustrated by a recent letter-writing flurry with the Pentagon, he's pushing a legislative amendment that would require the department to use internal budget plans consistent with the ones submitted publicly.    Meanwhile, Pentagon budget specialists began work this summer on a 10-year plan. This, too, is built on the same hugely optimistic internal projections, so that through the end of the century, the mismatch between planned-for funding and likely funding approaches the $1 trillion mark. </TEXT></DOC>
