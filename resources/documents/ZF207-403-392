(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>MICROCOMPUTERS By the end of 1989, we will have had our first real view ofthe race between the traditional workstation and PC vendors.andP;  While the costof workstation products and platforms from companies such as Apollo ComputerInc., Hewlett-Packard Co., Mips Computer Systems Inc. and Sun MicrosystemsInc. has been dropping, the performance power of the PCs from Apple ComputerInc., COMPAQ Computer Corp., Dell Computer Corp. and IBM has been increasing.andO;Two markets are now vying for the middle ground.andM;The traditional PC platforms from Intel Corp. and Motorola Inc. have broughta significant power increase with their new chips, the 80486 and the 68030,respectively.andP;  The 80486 is designed to yield two to three times theperformance of the 80386, with full binary compatibility with the 80X86MS-DOS environment.andP;  The 68030 is targeted to yield 7 million instructionsper second (MIPS) and improve throughput, thanks to an on-chip MemoryManagement Unit, data cache and address cache, as well as a dual-address busand data bus.andM;In the RISC-based workstation arena, there are the SPARC-based processorsfrom Fujitsu Ltd. and Sun, the Intel 80860, the Mips R3000 and the Motorola88000.andP;  As a result of these chip advances, the workstation market deliversthe same power and product at reduced cost, and the PC market delivers a morepowerful product at the same cost as existing PCs.andP;  Sooner or later, thesemarkets are going to have to meet.andM;What will this collision mean?andP;  First, customers will buy what they are mostcomfortable using.andP;  Those who are comfortable and happy with MS-DOS will notlikely hop on the UNIX bandwagon.andP;  Second, PCs and workstations havedifferent strengths and weaknesses.andP;  But, as they compete with one another,each will improve by absorbing the better techniques and features of itsrival.andM;Who is the customer for high-end PCs?andP;  These users will be professionals,using their machines primarily for highly interactive, ad hoc access toenterprise-level information and graphics-intensive applications.andM;The application technologies that will drive this advanced user include thoseinvolving compound document architectures, next-generation network computingand computer-mediated work group technology.andP;  These three applicationtechnologies allow team members to function as a cohesive unit.andM;Hewlett-Packard is clearly positioning itself to benefit from this new trend.andO;When it fulfills its announced plan to acquire workstation vendor Apollo, HPcan field a solid workstation line based on several underlying processors.andO;Combined, the workstation market share of Apollo and HP surpasses both thatof Digital and Sun.andP;  Meanwhile, Sun also is undergoing a remarkable shift.andO;Just as Apple charges headlong into the corporate computing world with abattle cry of &quot;The computer for the rest of us,&quot; Sun has now adapted thephrase, &quot;The UNIX for the rest of us.&quot;andM;But don't count Digital out of this new desktop market.andP;  By the end of 1991,The Yankee Group believes workstations will be Digital's second-largestrevenue producer.andP;  Nevertheless, the Maynard, Mass., giant is temporarily onthe defensive, and it must scramble if it is to overcome its increasedvulnerability to rivals Sun and HP.andM;Although the movement was originally inspired by Apple's flagship product,the Macintosh, Apple will struggle to maintain momentum in this new era ofdesktop computing.andP;  But Apple knows the location of the target and is willingto speculate that the PC/workstation will be operating at 100MIPS within fiveyears.andM;IBM has split its desktop initiative between its Advanced WorkstationDivision and its Entry Systems Division.andP;  While IBM's two-pronged approachmay very well succeed in the long run, it is a dangerous one in the shortterm: the company's dual focus could result in an ever-widening divergence,when the desktop market itself is converging.andM;The future of the traditional PC world will be consumed with debatesconcerning UNIX versus OS/2 versus DOS and MicroChannel versus ExtendedIndustry Standard Architecture (EISA).andP;  The indicator in the operatingsystems war will be the positions taken by major software developers.andP;  Watchwho is porting to UNIX versus OS/2.andP;  Then watch what happens with sales.andO;Right now, DOS is winning.andP;  Even those who port to UNIX will maintain DOS asa cash cow.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
