As Jesse Jackson lobbied committee members to make Sandamp;Ls devotemore of their lending for low-income housing and inner-cityredevelopment, the panel rejected attempts to continue pastaccounting techniques that had allowed many Sandamp;Ls to operate with noreal ``tangible'' capital.   The key vote was on an amendment by Rep. Thomas Ridge, D-Pa., togive regulators authority to continue so-called ``good will''exemptions from cash tangible capital requirements wanted by theadministration and approved by the committee last week.   Ridge's amendment was defeated by a 28-23 vote after opponentssaid good will is ``fake capital'' and said it is worthless as aresource to make sure that Sandamp;L owners have to pay before taxpayersdo in any future bailouts.   Also defeated on an voice vote was an amendment by Rep. SteveBartlett, R-Texas, that would have allowed the ``good will''exemptions negotiated by Sandamp;L owners in pre-1985 mergers to accountfor one-fourth of an Sandamp;L's tangible capital requirements unti 1993.   Instead, the committee placed new restrictions on the industry'sability to rapidly increase their growth through so-called brokereddeposits _ one factor blamed for the $100 billion magnitude of theSandamp;L crisis.   On a voice vote, it adopted an amendment by Rep. Stephen Neal,D-N.C., requiring both banks and Sandamp;Ls with capital levels belowfederal standards to get prior approval before seeking brokereddeposits in blocks of $100,000.   ``In many instances, real high-flyer savings and loans attractedlarge deposits with high interest rates and used them to make riskyloans,'' Neal said.   When those loans went bad, many Sandamp;Ls tried to ``grow their wayout of trouble'' by seeking more brokered deposits at even higherinterest rates for even riskier loans ``and we wound up with a muchbigger tab because of it,'' said Rep. Richard Lehman, D-Calif.   Assistant Treasury Secretary David Mullins called thecommittee's actions Monday ``another good day'' for theadministration's bailout plan. He said the committee rejected``resorting to acounting devices to water down'' Bush's proposedcapital standards.   The effort, however, is likely to arise again when the billreaches the House floor. Rep. Claude Pepper, D-Fla., chairman ofthe powerful House Rules Committee, expressed strong support for``good will'' accounting in a letter last week.   ``We're trying to be tough and fair, and not just tough,'' saidRidge, who cited hundreds of Sandamp;Ls in Illinois, Pennsylvania, NewYork, New Jersey and Ohio that lost much of their tangible capitalin the early 1980s by taking over failed thrifts at the urging ofthe federal government.   The committee chairman, Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas _ whowith a coalition of senior Repubicans and young Democrats on thecommittee has been leading the administration's fight for reformsagainst mostly young GOP lawmakers who want to weaken them _ saidgood will is worthless as capital.   ``It cannot be converted to cash to offset losses,'' he said.``When there is not capital or (only) fake capital, the losses fallto the insurance funds and the taxpayers.''   In exchange for taking over failed thrifts in the early 1980sand covering their losses, the Federal Savings and Loan InsuranceCorp. _ itself near insolvency _ granted healthy Sandamp;Ls more than $20billion in ``good will'' exemptions lasting up to 40 years fromnormal capital requirements.   But the institutions that pitched in with that aid by using muchof their own capital to effectively rescue the government'sinsurance fund then face possible extinction by the new standardswanted by Bush, Gonzalez and other reformers.   ``I understand that these institutions have a problem,'' saidRep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., who has been carrying much of theadministration's case. ``But so do we.   ``We're asking for $100 billion from taxpayers and flushing itdown the drain,'' Schumer said. ``And if you don't legislateagainst the 5 percent to 10 percent who would go back to the samepractices that got us here, we'll be back where we are today.''   The Bush administration originally proposed ending theexemptions gradually over 10 years in an effort to make Sandamp;L ownersput more of their own money at risk.   The Senate two weeks ago extended the good-will phaseout to 25years. But it said Sandamp;Ls must show that by June 1991 they have $1.50in tangible capital for every $100 of loans in their portfoliosthat could be seized before federal insurance funds are tapped tocover depositors' losses.   The House Banking Committee voted to toughen that requirementlast week, saying that Sandamp;Ls must have at least $3 of tangiblecapital for every $100 of loans by January 1995.   Jackson spent more than two hours in offices off the committee'shearing room lobbying its members on behalf of amendments to raisecorporate taxes to pay for the bailout and make Sandamp;Ls increase theirlending to minorities and for inner city projects.   Specifically, Jackson supports a proposed amendment by Reps.Joseph Kennedy, D-Mass., and Bruce Morrison, D-Conn., that wouldfinance the bailout by raising the alternative capital income taxfrom its present 20 percent to 25 percent and tax all capital gainsabove $175,000 a year at 33 percent.   The amendment has minuscule support and was not even introducedin the Senate as an alternative to President Bush's elaboratefinancing plan to prevent the cost of the bailout from adding tothe federal deficit and aggravating the need for higher taxes.   Bush's plan would raise an immediate $50 billion for the bailoutthrough the creation of an off-budget bond underwriter at anestimated cost to taxpayers of $200 billion to $250 billion overthe next 30 years.   ``This `Read my lips' slogan that he's adhering to is the mostcostly slogan in history,'' Jackson said. ``The Reagan-Bushadministration got us into trouble by disregarding their charge andmandate to regulate.''</TEXT></DOC>
