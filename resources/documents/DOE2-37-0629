Constitution:Bellows laminated axially and extensible only in the axial directionare disposed at the midway of an access port that connects a torus vacuumvessel and a cryostat. Bellows laminated radially and extensible onlyin the radial direction are disposed at the junction between the accessport and the cryostat. Thermal deformations generated upon baking cansufficiently be adsorbed by the bellows. (Ikeda, J.).</TEXT></DOC>
