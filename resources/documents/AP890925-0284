On other markets, copper futures fell; gold and platinum rose;energy futures advanced; grains and soybeans were mixed; andlivestock and meat futures were mixed.   Cotton futures settled .15 cent to 1.27 cents higher with thecontract for delivery in October at 73.15 cents a pound.   Prices had surged the 2-cents-a-pound daily limit earlier in thesession on reports of record-low temperatures overnight in the highplains of Texas and the Mississippi Delta Region.   Cold temperatures temporarily halt the development of the cottoncrop, which is rapidly maturing and in the early stages of theharvest.   ``It stops the growth completely until it gets warm again,''said Ernest Simon, cotton specialist with Prudential BacheSecurities Inc. in New York.   Profit-taking brought prices down near the end of the sessionbut forecasts for more cold weather later this week kept traders onedge.   The U.S. cotton crop has had a poor season, with too much rainin some areas and not enough in others. In a Sept. 12 crop report,the Agriculture Department projected this year's harvest at 12.28million bales, 20 percent below last year's crop.   Copper futures prices fell sharply on New York's CommodityExchange on news of a larger-than-expected, 13,500-metric-tonincrease in copper stocks registered with the London Metal Exchange.   The market had expected the exchange's weekly report to show abuildup of about 10,000 metric tons.   Copper settled 2.6 cents to 2.85 cents lower with September at$1.335 a troy ounce.   Gold futures rose sharply on the Commodity Exchange and platinumfutures posted strong gains on the New York Mercantile Exchange asthe dollar weakened on international currency markets.   Gold settled $3.60 to $4.20 higher with October at $370.30 atroy ounce; silver was 0.1 cent to 0.5 cent lower with September at$5.283 a troy ounce.   Platinum futures settled $7.30 to $8.10 higher with October at$488.10 a troy ounce.   Most energy futures rose moderately amid jitters about an OPECmeeting in Geneva.   Ministers of the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries were reported to be near an agreement to raise theircollective production ceiling to 21 million barrels per day from19.5 million barrels.   Analysts said world demand for OPEC oil exceeds 22 millionbarrels per day and many doubted the OPEC nations would adhere toproduction quotas.   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 18 cents to 20 centshigher with November at $19.46 a barrel; heating oil was .26 centto .72 cent higher with October at 57.51 cents a gallon; unleadedgasoline was .23 cent lower to .50 cent higher with October at61.67 cents a gallon.   Grain and soybean futures drifted to a mixed finish on theChicago Board of Trade, where a lack of significant news kept thetrading floor quiet and activity thin.   Frost occurred over the weekend in the northern tier ofMidwestern states and touched the northern extremes of Illinois,Indiana and Ohio but the chill was no worse than traders hadexpected and had little impact on prices.   Wheat futures settled 1 cent to 2 cents higher with December at$3.90\ a bushel; corn was \ cent lower to 1} cents higher withDecember at $2.30{ a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 1\ cents higherwith December at $1.42 a bushel; soybeans were 2 cents lower to 11cents higher with November at $5.72{ a bushel.
