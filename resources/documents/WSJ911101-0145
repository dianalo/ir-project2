An audit by the National Association of Regulatory UtilityCommissioners said that Bell Communications Research Inc.,called Bellcore, ran up the overcharges between 1984 and1990. The seven regional Bell companies, which own equalshares of Bellcore, then passed those charges on toratepayers, the group of state regulators said.</LP><TEXT>   As a result, the audit said, the overcharges increasedearnings at Bellcore and, ultimately, at the regional Bellcompanies. Each year, according to the audit, Bellcore paidout nearly all of its earnings as dividends to the Bellcompanies.   The audit will be presented to state regulators at ameeting this month, and it is expected to endorse a call fora refund. The Federal Communications Commission participatedin the audit but so far hasn't asked for refunds.   James Spurlock, an FCC common carrier official, called theaudit &quot;a staff memorandum&quot; prepared by state regulators andFCC staff. But the FCC hasn't reached a conclusion on itscontents, and Mr. Spurlock advised that the findings couldchange as the agency reviews the document.   &quot;It's like leaking a raw FBI report,&quot; Mr. Spurlock said.   Bellcore and the regional Bell companies disputed theaudit's findings and said that a refund wasn't necessary. &quot;Weconsider the audit absolutely inaccurate,&quot; said Brian Oliver,executive director for federal regulatory affairs at BellAtlantic Corp. A spokesman for BellSouth Corp. said that thecompany uses dividends from Bellcore to &quot;offset expenses&quot; andthat the revenue didn't affect customers' rates.   The audit said Bellcore used improper accounting methodsand inflated payments to the Bell companies so they couldcover anticipated income tax.   Bellcore countered that earlier audits by the group ofstate regulators had affirmed its cost accounting. Inaddition, Mr. Oliver of Bell Atlantic said that the auditused accounting rules approved by the FCC in 1988 and appliedthem to prior years. &quot;They're doing Monday morningquarterbacking,&quot; he charged.</TEXT></DOC>
