DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The lawyer for a South American mineral concernsuing the Hunt brothers of Dallas opened his case Wednesday byspinning a tale of financial intrigue involving Texas oilmen andArab sheiks.   Minpeco S.A., a mineral marketing company owned by the Peruviangovernment, is suing the three Hunt brothers, claiming theyconspired to corner the world silver market in 1979 and 1980.   Named as defendants in the case that opened before U.S. DistrictJudge Morris E. Lasker were: Nelson Bunker Hunt, William HerbertHunt and Lamar Hunt.   ``We will show that they did this using their incrediblefortunes with utter contempt for the legal and economic system thatwas so good to them,'' Mark Cymrot, attorney for Minpeco, told thejury in his opening statement at federal court in Manhattan.   None of the Hunts were present in court and they were notexpected to appear until the defense begins its case.   Other defendants include Mahmoud Fustok, described as the ownerof one of the world's largest thoroughbred stables andbrother-in-law of a Saudi Arabian prince.   ``We will show that they were greedy, power-hungry andunscrupulous,'' said Cymrot, adding ``What we intend to show isthat these men rigged the silver market.''   He claimed that the Hunts and their alleged co-conspirators wereresponsible for the sharp rise in silver prices from about $9 anounce to more than $50 an ounce between September 1979 and January1980.   Minpeco claims the skyrocketing prices caused it to lose morethan $100 million when the world silver market collapsed in March1980, with prices falling back to about $10 an ounce.   Six financial institutions accused of participating in thealleged conspiracy have settled with Minpeco for a total of $64.6million.   Minpeco is seeking about $150 million in damages plus trebledamages under both the anti-trust and racketeering laws which itclaims the Hunts and thier co-conspirators violated.   But in his opening argument to the jury, the Hunts's lawyerbelittled those claims.   The defense lawyer, Paul Curran, said rising interest rates,inflation and crude oil prices, coupled with an unstable worldpolitical situation, led to the silver market price rise.   He ticked off the Iranian revolution, the seizure of Americanhostages at the U.S. embassy in Teheran and the Soviet invasion ofAfghanistan.   ``It was these world and economic events that were the reasonfor the sharp rise in silver prices,'' said Curran.   He conceded silver prices went up, but noted gold, platinum anddiamond prices also rose during the same period because ``the priceof silver has historically fluctuated as a result of events in themarket place and in the world.''   The trial is expected to last several months.</TEXT></DOC>
