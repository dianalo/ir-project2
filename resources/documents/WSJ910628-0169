You ignoredseveral questions that must be answered before the secondnuclear age goes forward:   l) How do we know these reactors are &quot;much safer?&quot; Todaythey exist only on paper; they are years from completion, andthe industry producing them has a disastrous track record onpromises delivered. Analogously, how do we know these newreactors will be cheaper?</LP><TEXT>   2) If the new reactors are so safe, why is it necessary to&quot;streamline&quot; the licensing process so as to exclude thepublic? If these new reactors are safe, they should bedemonstrably safe, and there should be more public hearingsso that all concerns can be voiced.   3) What are we going to do with the radioactive waste andwith the reactors that need to be decommissioned? Currently,it is impossible even to create a sign that will last for100,000-plus years that will tell our descendants to stayclear. How are we going to design a repository that will besafe from earthquakes, volcanoes, terrorists and groundwaterintrusion for that length of time?   4) How can we possibly justify building more nuclearreactors when the U.S. currently wastes about half of theenergy it uses, and when we are witnessing such radicaladvances in solar and wind electricity-generatingtechnologies?   Moreover, the &quot;streamlining&quot; process dangerously ignoresthe numerous and invaluable safety improvements that haveresulted from past public interventions. By attempting to putthe blame on the process and not on the technology, thenuclear power industry and The Wall Street Journal areignoring the real reasons for its stagnation: nuclear poweris an obsolete, inherently dangerous, expensive andunworkable technology.   Our experiment with nuclear power has been an abysmalfailure. About half a trillion dollars have been spent in theU.S. on nuclear power, and it gives us only one-fifth of ourelectricity -- barely 8% of our total energy supply. We getmore usable energy from firewood. Trying to shove morenuclear power down the throats of a skeptical public is notgoing to bring about the second nuclear age.
