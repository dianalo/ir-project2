McFarlane, placed on two-years' probation Friday for misleadingCongress about covert U.S. support for the Nicaraguan rebels, willbe a key prosecution witness at the ongoing trial of his former aideOliver L. North.   Leaving the U.S. Courthouse with his wife, Jonda, McFarlane saidthe ordeal left him with ``strong faith and a terrific wife and afree country.''   ``I am looking to the future,'' he said.   McFarlane admitted he misled Congress by denying that North washelping the Contras raise money and transfer weapons when lawmakershad banned U.S. aid.   In a sentencing proceeding that lasted barely five minutes, U.S.District Judge Aubrey E. Robinson Jr. said McFarlane must complete200 hours of community service during his probabtion.   Robinson said ``the nature of the offense and the totality of thecircumstances'' required him to impose a $20,000 fine.   McFarlane could have received a four-year prison term and a$400,000 fine for pleading guilty to four misdemeanor charges ofwithholding information from Congress.   The retired Marine lieutenant colonel stood at ease with hishands clasped below his waist as he listened to the comments of hisattorney, Leonard Garment and the judge.   ``The public servants in this country are not to be found to bemore decent and more honorable,'' Garment said. ``Every action onhis part .... was taken out of a high sense of duty, a strong senseof serving his country's interests.''   McFarlane accompanied North to Tehran in May 1986 on anunsuccessful arms-for-hostages mission. McFarlane, by this timeretired from government, carried a key-shaped cake and a Biblesigned by President Reagan as a show of good faith.   In his emotionless voice, McFarlane said: ``Clearly, this episodein our history has rendered enormous turmoil on our country'sprocesses.   ``To the extent that I contributed to that I regret it. I triedto serve my country.''   Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh, who negotiated the pleaagreement with McFarlane before North and three co-defendants wereindicted last year, told reporters outside the courthouse his officehad made no recommendation about the sentence. He refused to commentfurther.   The sentencing took place on a day that North's trial hadrecessed for legal arguments. Former Air Force Lt. Col. RichardGadd, who provided aircraft for the Nicaraguan rebels during the``secret war'' that prosecutors say North waged after Congressbanned military aid, is scheduled to continue testifying when thetrial resumes Monday.   McFarlane had asked to be sentenced before he took the witnessstand against North.   He pleaded guilty March 11, 1988, to charges that he misledCongress in 1985 by stating in three letters that North was nothelping raise money for the Contras or providing military assistance.   The letters were written to the House intelligence committee andthe House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on the western hemisphere inresponse to queries about news reports that North was providing aidin defiance of the ban imposed by Congress.   Among the 12 felony charges against North are allegations that hemade false statement to Congress by drafting the false letters thatMcFarlane signed.   The defense contends that McFarlane should be held responsiblefor those letters, not North, who was below his boss on the chain ofcommand.   McFarlane also admitted misleading the full Foreign AffairsCommittee in testimony after the Iran-Contra affair became public inlater 1986 by denying knowledge of efforts to raise money fromforeign governments to help arm the rebels.</TEXT></DOC>
