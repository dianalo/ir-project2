Jan Stening of Sweden and Norwegian William Jorgenson greetedtheir wives and children at a downtown Vienna hotelslightly more 24hours after being freed by their unknown kidnappers.   Jorgenson said he feared he would die in the ordeal that beganwith his Feb. 5 abduction.   ``My only thought was of my wife,'' said Jorgenson, pausing tocollect himself as his daughter, Sessil, began crying. His wife,Gerd, and son, Kurt, also were at the news conference.   Stening, 44, and Jorgenson, 58, were working with theVienna-based U.N. Works and Relief Agency that cares for some280,000 refugees in Lebanon when they were kidnapped.   Giorgio Giacomelli, head of the Vienna-based agency, Giacomellisaid both men were in relatively good shape.   ``It's the end of a very sad story, which luckily had a happyconclusion,'' Giacomelli said.   In Beirut on Wednesday, a group called the Holy Warriors ofFreedom claimed responsibility for the Jan. 27 kidnapping of WestGerman engineer Ralph Schray and said it may release him soon.   The claim was made in a typewritten Arabic statement from thegroup, which is believed to be headed by a brother of two menalready linked to a 1985 hijacking and to the kidnappings.   The statement was released to a Western news agency in Beirutalong with a photograph of Schray. The picture showed a beardedSchray in blue jeans and a dark blue sweater looking directly atthe camera.   Giacomelli noted the other kidnap victims in Lebanon and saidtheir plight tempered the happiness over the return of Stening andJorgenson.   Including Schray, there are 23 foreigners missing after beingkidnapped in Lebanon since March 1985. They are nine Americans,four Frenchmen, three Britons, a West German, an Italian, anIrishman, an Indian and two unidentified men.   The longest held hostage is American Terry Anderson, chiefMiddle East correspondent for The Associated Press. He waskidnapped March 16, 1985.   ``Our common joy doesn't allow us to forget other colleagues whoare still missing. We hope they will join us again soon,''Giacomelli said.   Among those missing is U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins,who was abducted Feb. 17 in south Lebanon.   A statement released by the abductors, the Organization of theOppressed on Earth, said Israel's crackdown on Palestinian unrestin Israeli-occupied territories and the Middle East trip ofSecretary of State George P. Shultz ``make us more determined totry this criminal, Higgins.''   Both the United Nations and the United States have denied thatHiggins, who served with the U.N. peacekeeping force in southLebanon, was a CIA spy.   Higgins, 43, was abducted near south Lebanon's port of Tyre onFeb. 17. He heads a 76-man U.N. observer group that monitors truceviolations on the Lebanon-Israel border under a 1949 armisticeagreement.   Stening said at a morning news conference in Beirut that fourgunmen kidnapped the two U.N. workers near south Lebanon'sprovincial capital of Sidon as they were driving from their base inthe southern port of Tyre to Beirut.   The two men were moved to various locations in Lebanon.   The first word about the release of Stening and Jorgenson camein a handwritten Arabic statement delivered to a Western newsagency in Beirut late Tuesday. The statement was accompanied by apicture showing the two men. It said ``after they were provedinnocent, they were released.''   Most of the U.N. relief group's services to the refugees weresuspended after the abudctions. Giacomelli did not say if theywould be resumed.   At one point during his captivity, Jorgenson said he wasconvinced he and Stening would be killed when what looked like anexplosive was brought into one of the rooms where they were held.   Jorgenson said their clothes were cleaned and the two men weregiven a chance to wash the day before they were released.   On Tuesday, with his new freedom, Jorgenson said he startedsmoking again.   ``I'm a free man and I can cough when I want to,'' he quipped.</TEXT></DOC>
