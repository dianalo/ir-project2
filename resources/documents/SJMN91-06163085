Full restitution has since been made.;    SJS Athletic DirectorTom Brennan said Monday's court decision to reduce charges from felony tomisdemeanor does not change athletic department actions taken regarding theplayers. He recommended to the financial aid office May 28 that the players'athletic scholarships be canceled for the 1991-92 school year -- Higginbothamwas the only one of the four not on scholarship -- and suspended them from theteam. The players had the option of appealing the recommendation.;    Althoughthe district attorney's office supported the reduced charges for Crump,Terrell and St. Julien, it objected during the proceedings to similartreatment for Higginbotham.;    Judge Paul C.
