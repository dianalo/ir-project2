The search warrant said the government is investigating the``bribery of public officials'' in connection with a scheme inwhich defense contractors got inside information from formergovernment officials whom they had hired as consultants.   Attorney General Edwin Meese III declined to give a directanswer when asked if bribes had been accepted in the Pentagon.   ``That will all come out in the course of the indictments andultimately in the trials,'' he told reporters.   The fraud and bribery investigation, involving the alleged saleof information to some of the nation's biggest defense contractors,drew attention all over Washington.   President Reagan ``is very concerned'' about the revelations ofthe past few days, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said after a meetingthat included the president, Vice President George Bush, Meese andFBI Director William Sessions.   Reagan instructed them to move ``as rapidly as possible'' to getthe facts.   Meese said indictments may be handed down in 30 to 90 days.   Fitzwater said the matter ``certainly poses an internal securityproblem.'' He said Reagan ``feels that this is a matter thatdeserves his attention and that everyone involved should know ofhis feelings, the intensity which he feels about dealing with anykinds of crimes that have been committed here.''   Law enforcement sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,said about 200 subpoenas had been served this week, some of them onmajor defense contractors other than the 15 companies andconsultants whose offices had been searched Tuesday.   The New York Times, citing unidentified legal sources at theJustice Department and elsewhere, reported in Friday editions thatthe offices of at least three House members had been placed underinvestigation as part of the probe. The sources would not identifythe lawmakers whose offices were involved or say who might facecharges in the case, the lawmakers or their aides, the newspapersaid.   The search warrant that shed new light on the case was unsealedin federal court in St. Louis. It said Melvyn Paisley, who servedfrom 1981 to April 1987 as assistant secretary of the Navy forresearch, engineering and systems, a key acquisitions post,provided ``classified and-or confidential'' documents to McDonnellDouglas.   Paisley was a key associate of former Navy Secretary John F.Lehman. Paisley now has numerous defense contractors as clients inhis consulting business.   Sources also said Paisley is a consultant for UnitedTechnologies, whose Washington offices were searched Tuesday by FBIagents as part of the fraud and bribery probe. The agents took awayall documents in United Technologies's files relating to Paisley,said the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity.   The agents also took documents relating to the 404 and T-406engines which Pratt andamp; Whitney, a United Technologies' subsidiary.Paisley began working as a United Technologies consultant within aweek after he left his Pentagon job last year, according to thesources.   The warrant in St. Louis authorized a search of the McDonnellDouglas office of company executive Thomas Gunn for ``insideinformation pertaining to'' the F-16 fighter plane manufactured bya competitor, General Dynamics Corp.   Gunn is vice president for marketing at McDonnell Douglas, whichdid $7.7 billion worth of Pentagon business in fiscal 1987, makingit the nation's largest defense contractor.   The fraud case _ culminating two year of undercover work andwiretaps of the offices of top Pentagon procurement officials _started coming to light this week when federal investigators servedsearch warrants on 15 companies and a half-dozen Defense Departmentofficials.   Government sources, speaking on condition they not beidentified, said the probe has involved court-authorized phone tapsand bugs at Paisley's consulting office after he left the Pentagon.   Evidence from the phone tap and the bug on Paisley plus taps onthe phones of two current Pentagon officials, Victor Cohen andJames Gaines, led investigators to the defense contractors and thisweek's widespread searches in 12 states. Sources told TheAssociated Press the taps on Cohen and Gaines were at theirPentagon offices.   NBC News reported Thursday that the court-authorized wiretapslasted 290 days and overheard nearly 4,800 conversations, of which671 were considered incriminating.   The Washington Post, citing an unidentified law enforcementsource, reported in Friday editions that at least 12 phones hadbeen tapped, including that of William Galvin, a colleague ofPaisley's and a consultant associated with several defensecontractors.   The source also said one government employee received more than$100,000 in cash in return for information, and that investigatorsalso were looking into allegations that personal bills, vacationsand other expenses of government employees were paid byconsultants, the newspaper reported.   ``Information that McDonnell Douglas had that was not availableto the contracting public'' included data on the sale of the F-16fighter to the Swiss government, information from the Navy on theSuper Hornet F-18 and inside information pertaining to GeneralDynamics, the search warrant said.   The warrant also sought a ``proposed letter to McDonnell Douglasmarked `secret''' relating to the F-18, which the company wanted tosell in Europe.   In addition, the warrant authorized a search of Gunn's officefor documentation pertaining to the advanced tactical aircraftprogram ``and Paisley's efforts to steer it toward McDonnellDouglas.''   ``Information about a company's competitors' offers ... is neverdisclosed to a company prior to the award of a contract,'' said thewarrant. ``A company which has access to that information prior tothe time when best and final offers must be submitted can benefitgreatly.''   McDonnell Douglas issued a statement saying that much of theinformation sought by the Justice Department ``was informationproperly supplied to the company. ... We are not aware of anyimproper requests by the company to Mr. Paisley or any improperactivities by Mr. Paisley on behalf of the company.'' The firm saidit is cooperating with the government.   Gunn issued a statement saying that his work for McDonnellDouglas ``has been thoroughly proper and legal. Any assertions orallegations to the contrary are false. I have never ... misused anyinformation related to McDonnell Douglas.''   Meese, asked when he was first told by Justice Department aidesof the investigation, said, ``I've been briefed on it some timeago. I can't remember exactly when.''   Meese's name turned up on at least one of the court-authorizedwire taps installed as part of the probe, said federal lawenforcement sources, speaking on condition of anonymity. Because ofthat, he was not told of the investigation until late March, afterit was determined by investigators he was not involved in any ofthe alleged wrongdoing, the sources said.   ``We are hopeful that indictments will be completed within thenext 30 to 90 days,'' Meese said.   Meese said he told Reagan that the investigation ``in no wayreflected on the procurement procedures of the (Defense)department. It appears that dishonest individuals tried tocircumvent those procedures and that therefore we were taking theprompt action along with Department of Defense investigators to getto the bottom of this.''   Asked how much of an embarrassment the probe was to Reagan,Meese said:   ``I don't think it's an embarrassment. Quite the contrary. Ithink the fact that whenever you can uncover dishonest activity,investigate it thoroughly and then take the necessary action, it'sa vindication of good governmental action, to weed out those peoplewho are taking advantage of the system or committing improper orwrongful conduct.''   Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard said Defense Secretary Frank C.Carlucci has ordered two top officials to form a task force tomonitor developments in the investigation and ascertain ifcontracting procedures must be overhauled. Kathleen Buck, thePentagon's general counsel, and Robert Costello, the undersecretaryfor acquisition, will head the panel.</TEXT></DOC>
