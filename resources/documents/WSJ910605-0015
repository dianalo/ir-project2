The Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund sued the State WaterResources Control Board in state court in Sacramento,alleging violations of wildlife laws. The suit contends thata recent proposal by the board for protecting wildlife in thebay and the delta are inadequate.</LP><TEXT>   The fight over bay and delta water is important becausethe deltas of the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers providedrinking water for millions of people, in addition to beingprime habitat for waterfowl and many other animals.   Environmentalists generally want more water to flow frombehind dams on the rivers to keep salt water from intrudinginto the delta and to help flush out San Francisco Bay, whichmany environmentalists contend is becoming badly polluted.Increasing those flows, however, could mean less water foragriculture and some other users.   If the suit succeeds, the elaborate plumbing system thatCalifornia has built to move water from the rivers of thenorth to the deserts of the south might require drasticrevamping.</TEXT></DOC>
