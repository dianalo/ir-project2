On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the contract for Novemberdelivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, hita low of $13.25 a barrel at midday.   The last time the near-month contract closed below that levelwas on Aug. 1, 1986, when it reached $11.55 a barrel. Prices hadfallen below $14 a barrel several times in recent weeks butrebounded before trading sessions ended.   ``The story is a complete breakdown in OPEC's discipline,'' saidPeter Beutel, an oil analyst with Elders Futures Inc.   The November crude contract dropped 19 cents Thursday to settleat $13.92. That was the lowest settlement price for a near-monthcontract since $13.73 price of Oct. 29, 1986.   Analysts said statements from OPEC Secretary General Subrotothat Saudi Arabia was increasing its oil output sent the marketinto a frenzy.   Subroto's acknowledgement that world oil prices probably wouldbe weak for the long-term indicated the unlikelihood thatdiscipline would be restored anytime soon, analysts said.   Saudi Arabia, the largest producer in the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries, has taken the lead in the past inbringing other members back to their assigned quotas.   Saudi Arabia is said to have recently joined the United ArabEmirates, Kuwait and Iraq in exceeding their quota, leading tospeculation that the Saudis are trying a new strategy to force OPECmembers to rein in oil production.   But Subroto said in an interview that the move could send pricesinto a tailspin, to as low as $5 a barrel, if the Saudis used theiravailable capacity.   In other trading Thursday, prices for refined oil products rose.Wholesale unleaded gasoline for October delivery closed up 0.25cent at 46.42 cents a gallon. Other contract months were lower.   October heating oil rose 0.04 cent to 39.54 cents a gallon, andother monthly contracts also advanced.   Analysts said the gains in gasoline stemmed from the recenthurricane threat in the Gulf of Mexico when refineries and oil rigshalted operations.   API statistics released Tuesday showed that although gasolineinventories were up 2.2 million barrels on a weekly basis to 219million barrels, they were 10 million barrels below the same perioda year earlier.   Brokers said crude prices continued deteriorating, reflectinginvestor concern over the surplus of oil on world markets.   ``It's a continuation of the same old junk we've seen for thelast four weeks,'' said Bud Degorgue, a trader with Drexel BurnhamLambert Inc.   Analysts have said there is an excess of more than 1 millionbarrels a day of oil on world markets. Recent meetings of membersof the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries have notresulted in any concrete steps to restrain output, pushing priceslower.</TEXT></DOC>
