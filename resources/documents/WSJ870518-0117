The commission is expected to decide soon whether to uphold or revise its decision. Several observers believe the agency will uphold most of its decision but will allow some additional transportation costs to be passed on to U.S. customers.    In a letter, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney reminded President Reagan of the importance of the issue to Canada. Four of Mr. Mulroney's cabinet ministers also have raised the issue with their U.S. counterparts. U.S. and Canadian officials say the ruling is becoming a hindrance to the free-trade talks, aimed at eliminating tariffs and other trade barriers between the two countries.    U.S. independent natural-gas producers, suffering from low prices and a shrinking market, are in favor of the ruling. The decision requires that costs of Canadian gas be billed the same way as most domestic gas. &quot;We have been advocating fair competition of Canadian and American gas,&quot; says Robert Platt, natural-gas counsel for the Independent Petroleum Association of America.    Mr. Platt charges that the Canadian government has &quot;attempted to exercise improper influence&quot; by interceding with the U.S. administration. He says the association would take to the U.S. Court of Appeals any reversal of the decision.    The Canadian government views the U.S. regulatory decision as an impingement on its sovereign right to choose how to regulate energy rates. If the ruling is upheld, Canadian natural-gas producers likely would ask Canada's regulatory agency for permission to charge U.S. customers less than they charge Canadian customers for natural gas, which could cause a political storm in Canada.    U.S. government officials said the U.S. Department of Energy is deeply divided on the matter.    In its decision last December, the FERC, in a 5-0 vote, struck down two-thirds of the fixed fees that Chicago-based Natural Gas Pipeline Co. charges customers for access to Canadian gas. The agency suspended implementation of its order, pending a final decision. But the ruling has been applied in at least six other FERC orders. The Canadian government says the decision could affect between $140 million and $400 million in Canadian export revenue.    U.S. sales are important to Canadian natural-gas producers, who are also hurting from poor market conditions. In 1986, 740 billion cubic feet of Canadian natural gas, valued at about $1.6 billion, was sold in the U.S. That was barely half of the volumes authorized for export to the U.S. Natural Gas Pipeline, a unit of Los Angeles-based Occidental Petroleum Corp., hasn't purchased any gas from its main Canadian suppliers for more than a year.    Canadian gas represents between 4.5% and 5% of the U.S. gas market and a much larger portion of the West Coast market, says a U.S. Energy Department official. About 40% of the gas distributed by San Francisco-based Pacific Gas andamp; Electric Co. is Canadian-sourced, the official said. </TEXT></DOC>
