(Fiber Distributed Data Interface) (inexpensivewiring solutions could popularize the technology)</TITLE><AUTHOR>McPartlin, John P.; Garvey, Martin.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>A major barrier to the widespread implementation of the FiberDistributed Data Interface (FDDI) standard is the cost of rewiringto accommodate fiber optic technology.andP;  Vendors are researchingnew techniques that would let FDDI run on traditional wiring.andO;Fiber optic cable consists of a glass filament light pipesurrounded by threads.andP;  Codenoll Technologies Corp and the PackardElectric Division of General Motors Corp have developed a form ofplastic-fiber wiring that may bridge the cost gap betweentraditional and fiber optic cable.andP;  The new technology uses arayon polymer-type polycarbonate product that resemblesplexiglass.andP;  Analysts say that while the new wiring techniqueoffers easy installation, low cost and reliability, it lacks thebandwidth of glass.andP;  It nevertheless has enough bandwidth for FDDIand may spur acceptance of the fiber optic standard.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Fiber Distributed Data Interface StandardFiber OpticsToken Ring NetworksCostFuture of ComputingFuture TechnologiesData CommunicationsNew Technique.andO;Feature:   illustrationphotograph.andM;</DESCRIPT></DOC>
