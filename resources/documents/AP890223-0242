These, along with automatic teller machines, are consideredluxuries that the large savings and loan company says it willforsake for now.   Staying lean, and sticking to the traditional business of safesingle-family home loans, has helped make Golden West a huge successstory in an industry marred by fraud, incompetence and high-flyinglending deals.   About a quarter of the 3,200 federally insured Sandamp;Ls areconsidered insolvent or close to it, with most concentrated in theoil and farm belts.   These thrifts account for most of the industrywide losses, andthe government is grappling for solutions that will likely requiremore than $100 billion in aid.   The crisis has incited widespread speculation that Sandamp;Ls willinevitably die like dinosaurs. Nevertheless, many have made it tothe top or rebounded from hard times and intend to stay there.   ``The guys who got in trouble got away from tradition,'' saidJames H. Grohl, a senior vice president for the industry trade groupU.S. League of Savings Institutions. ``If you stuck to your housingknitting, chances are you'd be in much better shape.''   A study by the giant trade organization last fall found thatthrifts considered successful had twice as many assets, on average65 percent, in traditional housing related investments such asmortgages or mortgage-backed securities, as unhealthy institutions.The problem thrifts had three times as many assets, 40 percent vs.12.7 percent, in non-traditional areas such as commercial loans orrisky ``junk bond'' securities, the report found.   Golden West, with $14 billion in assets, is probably the bestexample of a thrift that has prospered by staying on the straightand narrow. It makes no loans except for housing, and 80 percent ofthem are for single-family units.   As a result, bad loans represent 0.4 percent of its loanportfolio, compared with 2 percent for the industry on average.   Husband-and-wife team Herbert and Marion Sandler have placed atight rein on costs since taking the thrift's helm in 1963 andsteadily expanding it to 200 branches in six states, partly throughcarefully planned acquisitions.   Instead of footing the bill for a receptionist, Golden West asksvisitors to announce themselves through a black telephone in a smallreception area at its 17th floor executive suite. The Sandlers alsohave gone without the comforts of a private diningroom or a chef,preferring to munch deskside on fruit and cottage cheese.   Customers also don't have access to ATMs because the Sandlers,who control a 20 percent stake in the company, don't think it makessense financially, although Sandler says the wiring is in place ifthey decide to take the plunge.   Sandler said his thrifty thrift is not a penny pincher. ``We'rejust planning to grow prudently,'' he said.   Golden West also has an aggressive training program geared toimproving customer service and a covert team of ``shoppers'' whorank employee performance at bank branches, he noted.   Equally as lean and mean only on a smaller scale is WashigtonFederal Savings and Loan Association in Seattle, which has $2billion in assets and is widely thought to be one of the strongestand best managed thrifts in the country. Less than 10 percent of itsloan portfolio is in commercial real estate.   More telling is Washington Fed's 11 percent ratio of equity toassets, among the highest in the nation and four times the minimumamount required by the Federal Savings and Loan Insuranceregulations. The company believes the strong net worth positionwill, among other things, protect earnings against interest raterisk.   Talman Home Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, a Chicago thriftwith $6.3 billion in assets, and TCF Financial Banking and Savingsof Minneapolis, with $5.2 billion in assets, learned the hard waythat venturing too far from their roots is risky.   Talman started out with the traditional focus of mortgagelending. But Chairman Theodore H. Roberts said its problems beganafter acquiring four troubled Sandamp;Ls at the urging of federalregulators, which were heavily involved in commercial real estate.   The company has since gotten back on its feet with the help ofabout $200 million in federal assistance.   Roberts said all problem assets have since been disposed of,along with about 20 unprofitable branches, and the thrift has become``plain vanilla'' again.   ``The secret of success is just to go back to basics and do whatthe thrift charter intended us to do, which is to take in personalsavings and intermediate those savings into single family homeloans,'' Roberts said.   TCF, formerly known as Twin City Federal Savings andamp; LoanAssociation, got into trouble after setting up a big-time lendingoperation, National Properties Inc., in New York more than fiveyears ago. It had planned to make money by funneling the savings ofthrifty Minnesotans into Eastern real estate ventures, but wound upwith about $100 million in loan losses.   ``We made most of the classic mistakes that were made in theindustry,'' said William Cooper, TCF chairman and chief executiveofficer.   Three years ago, a new management team led by Cooper beganreshuffling TCF's loan portfolio and closing unprofitable branches.TCF revived its nearly dormant mortgage lending operation and founda comfortable niche in consumer finance.   ``We capitalized off our roots and diversified but into the kindsof things that Sandamp;Ls tend to do well, which is retail banking,''Cooper said.   Bert Ely, an Alexandria, Va., thrift consultant, said thriftsoften do well in finding the proper niche. ``They've got to besomewhat like the gourmet delicatessen, so to speak, or the shopthat sells clothing for tall men.''   Columbia Savings andamp; Loan of Beverly Hills, Calif., had found acomfortable, and very profitable, niche in junk bonds, with thehigh-yield, high-risk securities making up about a quarter of its$11 billion in assets.   While the volatile junk market is not considered a traditionalsafe haven for thrifts, Columbia beat the odds through goodmanagement, analysts said.   ``The key is they've brought sufficient expertise aboard,'' saidHenry S. Peltz, a thrift analyst with Keefe Bruyette andamp; Woods, a NewYork securities firm. ``They have their own underwriting, investmentdepartment. They don't take anybody else's word for it.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Feb. 26</NOTE></DOC>
