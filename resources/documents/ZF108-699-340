(IDC) ofFramingham, Mass., even companies with big investments in  optical storageconvert only about 10 percent of their archival storage devices to opticalmedia.andM;WEIGHING THE COSTSandM;Generally, companies can manage archival storage costs most effectively byemploying tape devices or removable disks as primary mass storage devices,and turning to optical disk subsystems only for specific applications thatneed the amenities of optical.andP;  An example such applications are databasesthat maintain terabytes of data and have unusually high--but notrapid--accessibility requirements.andM;Optical disks can also prove beneficial when the cost of replacing lost orcorrupted application data would be intolerably high.andP;  Such optical storagecandidates typically include applications that manage data recorded bymonitoring or measuring devices; personnel, payroll or tax records; orscanned, CAD or combined text and graphics images.andM;Twelve-inch WORM drives offer the least expensive form of optical storagebecause of their lower prices per megabyte.andP;  In situations where data needsto be accessed by many users simultaneously, 5-1/4-inch optical disk drivesprovide faster response times, although they demand higher per-megabyteprices.andM;The high cost of optical disks and drives greatly limits the appeal ofoptical subsystems.andP;  In both cost-per-megabyte and physical drive costs, tapedrives beat optical disk devices handily.andP;  (See &quot;Comparative costs of storagemedia,&quot; above.)andM;At about 2 cents per megabyte, 8mm helical-scan tape drives provide the leastexpensive archive option.andP;  Close behind are 4mm digital audiotape (DAT)drives, costing around 3 cents per megabyte, and IBM 3480-compatible drives,at approximately 4 cents per megabyte.andP;  By contrast, 12-inch WORM opticaldisks cost substantially more at about 11 cents per megabyte, and 5 1/4-inchWORM optical disks cost a whopping 16.6 cents per megabyte.andP;  Typical DAT and8mm helical-scan tape drives, meanwhile, sell for approximately $4,500, and12-inch optical drives average around $6,000.andM;On the other hand, price per megabyte is not the only yardstick by whichcompanies should measure archival storage systems.andP;  Additional, and critical,considerations include the value an organization assigns to the informationbeing archived and the expenses involved in maintaining an appropriatephysical environment for each subsystem type.andM;Estimating the value of the data being stored is the first step a companyshould take in justifying the cost of any archival storage method.andP;  If thedata is critical and needs to remain available in a guaranteed uncorruptedstate for many years, the best solution is decidedly low-tech: it'sacid-free, 100 percent rag paper.andP;  But if archiving reams of paper in mammothstorage facilities doesn't sound appealing, optical storage provides the nextbest level of assurance that stored information will be readily available,and in its original state, when needed.andM;According to IDC, retrieving a lost paper document might cost a companyaround $120.andP;  And in some cases, such as accessing hospital records that areneeded for insurance claims or protection from legal action, lost data costscan soar much higher.andP;  Such potential expenses can make a strong financialargument for utilizing an electronic archival storage system.andM;That still leaves companies facing a choice between tape and optical storage.andO;And that's where environmental and maintenance considerations enter in.andO;Providing appropriate storage environments and media maintenance are factorsthat companies should consider when figuring the true cost of archivalstorage alternatives.andM;To ensure data integrity, magnetic tapes need to be stored undertemperature-and humidity-controlled conditions.andP;  In addition, magnetic tapesmust be rewound and re-tensioned periodically to ensure their continuingviability, resulting in increased labor costs to maintain a tape library.andM;Optical disks, by contrast, are created using tellurium, platinum or tinalloys as the actual recording medium and are more resistant to environmentalfactors.andP;  Optical disks aren't affected by the handling and storage extremesthat can boondoggle tape and magnetic drives.andM;By storing archival information on optical disks, an organization can avoidthe costs of maintaining environmentally controlled storage facilities, aswell as the cost of tape maintenance tasks.andM;The minimal human intervention and modest environmental provisions requiredfor optical disks don't fully counterbalance the expensive price tags ofoptical media and drives.andP;  But in that niche where reliability is paramount,and lost or corrupted data exacts a high price, optical disks may prove derigueur.andM;Questions also have been raised recently regarding the actual life span ofoptical disks.andP;  Although some manufacturers of optical disks specify a30-year lifetime for their products, the technology is clearly too young forthese developmental predictions to be borne out by real-world experience.andM;According to a 1989 study reported by Disk Trend, a Mountain View, Calif.,andO;market research company, accelerated life tests indicated that optical diskshave a useful life span of about 10 years, the same duration that mostmagnetic tapes can reliably maintain data.andM;Even assuming, however, that optical disks have the same life span asmagnetic devices, because maintaining optical reliability costs less, opticaldisk subsystems still could provide a better return on investment in the longrun.andM;Another factor that favorably affects the payback of optical disk storage isthe physical space savings the technology affords.andM;Typical optical disk library systems (commonly called &quot;jukeboxes&quot;)accommodate from 10 to 200 optical disks, each capable of storing as much as2GB of data, for a total of 20GB to 400GB of archival storage in a relativelysmall footprint.andP;  Some larger WORM disks store as much as 8.2GB per disk,providing 400GB on only 50 disks.andP;  (See &quot;Storage requirements for 8.2GB ofdata,&quot; left.)andM;By contrast, storing 20GB of data on a reel-to-reel tape subsystem wouldrequire more than 100 10-inch reels.andP;  The latest helical-scan cartridge tapeofferings, 8mm and 4mm DAT drives, could squeeze 20GB of data into eight or15 slightly smaller DAT cartridges, respectively.andM;Clearly, optical disks can decrease physical media storage requirements whenlarge volumes of data must be archived.andP;  In locations where real estate costsare high, such savings can translate into a substantial dollar benefit.andP;  Fora conservative example, if office space costs $10 per square foot, using 100fewer square feet for physical media storage would translate into $1,000,which would recoup the cost of 6GB of optical disk storage.andM;Another advantage optical disks have over magnetic tape is faster accesstimes.andP;  Whereas tape drives must rewind tape to find a file marker, opticaldrives simply spin the optical disk and move the drive's arm to quickly findfiles.andP;  Optical disks are rightfully criticized for posting slower on-linedata access rates than magnetic disk drives, but when it comes to accessingarchived data, optical disk jukeboxes often beat comparable magnetic tapelibraries.andM;According to Disk Trend, file access times for a high-capacity DAT tapesubsystem can run into two or three minutes, whereas accessing the same fileson an optical disk jukebox requires only 15 to 20 seconds.andM;There are a few other negative cost factors that must be considered.andP;  First,host software requirements aren't always included in the price of opticaldisk subsystem and can prove expensive.andP;  WORM drives can't update VMS filedirectories, instead requiring extra-cost software that enables the hostcontroller to rewrite the directory whenever a change is made.andP;  Besides itsadded expense, the rewriting process can also be time-consuming, adding thecost of having users wait for updates to be written to the optical disk.andM;Second, because WORM drives aren't erasable and therefore aren't similarlogically to other archive media, the driver software for optical disksystems is far more complex to write.andP;  This development factor againincreases the purchase price of a WORM optical disk subsystem.andM;In addition, the current dependence of WORM optical drives on software,rather than firmware, to link to host operating systems means that eachdrive's performance can vary widely, depending upon the quality of thatsoftware.andP;  Error detection and correction algorithms and other driverfeatures can effect overall optical disk throughput by as much as 10 percent.andM;The optical disk software factor can have other serious consequences.andP;  In oneworst-case scenario, an Air Force base discovered that the software requiredto drive its optical disk jukeboxes wasn't compatible with the most recentversion of VMS.andP;  The base opted to wait for the controller's next scheduledsoftware revision, because a custom fix for the bug would have cost around$10,000.andP;  (See &quot;Buyers squeezed for storage space elect optical,&quot; page 28.)andM;Although WORM drives are currently the optical technology that come closestin price to tape storage systems, it is not likely that they will remain theonly contender.andP;  Already, optical disks providing one-pass read/writecapability have been announced at costs of $5,000 per drive and $250 per 1GBdisk.andP;  (See &quot;Rewritable optical technology improving, but hurdles remain,&quot;page 30.)andP;  Although the per-megabyte cost for these disks comes to a hefty 25cents, erasable optical drives require fewer disks, which is a significantcost reduction factor.andM;Optical disk product prices will likely decline over the next five years, asproduction methods and capacities for read/write disks increase.andP;  In somecases, manufacturers are designing their read/write disks to be compatiblefor use with their earlier WORM drives, allowing organizations to upgradegradually to the new media.andM;But optical disk devices are plagued by a lack of standards, and the varietyof optical disk types and drives in use today makes drive standardizationunlikely for the foreseeable future.andM;Yet despite these shortcomings, optical disks can provide a cost-effectivereturn on investment for large archival storage requirements.andP;  The highinitial cost of optical disks and drives can be counterbalanced byreliability gains, by the medium's ability to withstand somewhat harsherenvironmental factors and by the data integrity insurance--the peace ofmind--that optical disk archival storage affords.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
