PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reformscontributed to a 17 percent increase in the Soviet crime rate lastyear, the interior minister was quoted Thursday as saying.   ``Robberies, assaults and theft of personal property increased infrequency by more than a third,'' Interior Minister Vadium Bakatinsaid in an interview in the Communist Party newspaper Pravda.   Attacks on police increased and street crime rose by more than 40percent, said Bakatin, who supervises the Soviet Union's uniformedpolice.   In his first major interview since taking over in October, hesaid police themselves were often corrupt and ill-prepared to fightcrime.   Under Gorbachev, officials and the state media have been moreopen about reporting drug abuse, prostitution and other crimes,including details of criminal investigations.   But Bakatin's half-page interview in Pravda was an importantadmission that reform has brought problems as well.   He said the reforms have created ``complicated, at times painfulprocesses of self-cleansing, an increase in civil and ethnicself-awareness.''   Two republics where ethnic awareness is growing most rapidly,Latvia and Estonia, headed the areas where Bakatin said crime isgrowing most rapidly.   He also cited several times the violence between Armenians andAzerbaijanis, where Interior Ministry troops were called in torestore order.   Many criminals released from labor colonies under legal reformshave been unable to find work because state industries are cuttingback their workforces to meet efficiency demands of Gorbachev'seconomic reforms, he said. Some return to crime.   Bakatin also said police are ill-prepared to cope with organizedcrime seeping into the cooperative movement of private enterprise,which Gorbachev has encouraged to provide goods and services notavailable under the state economy.   Bakatin gave no figures for the number of crimes committed, butsaid, ``It can be stated boldly that the level of crime in thecountry is significantly higher than statistics indicate today.''   He also said the police system should be reformed.   ``We have everything in the system of the Ministry of InternalAffairs: bribery, treachery, bureaucratism, callousness, rudeness,departmental separatism and illegality,'' he said.   Some local police have tried to keep the number of crimes theyreport as low as possible, fearing that reporting an increase willdamage their careers, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
