Background</ITAG>Administration of the Medicare program is governed by the Medicare statute,title XVIII of the Social Security Act (the Act). The Medicare law providescoverage for broad categories of benefits, including impatient and outpatienthospital care, skilled nursing facility (SNF) care, home health care, andphysicians' services. It places general and categorical limitations onthe coverage of the services furnished by certain health care practitioners,such as dentists, chiropractors, and podiatrists, and it specifically excludessome categories of services from coverage, such as cosmetic surgery, personalcomfort items, custodial care, routine physical checkups, and proceduresthat are not reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment ofan illness or injury. The statute also provides direction as to the mannerin which payment is made for Medicare services, the rules governing eligibilityfor services, and the safety and quality standards to be met by institutionsproviding services to Medicare beneficiaries.The Medicare law does not, however, provide an all-inclusive list of specificitems, services, treatment procedures, or technologies covered by Medicare.Thus, except for the examples of durable medical equipment in section 1861(n)of the Act, and some of the medical and other health services listed insections 1861(s) and 1862(a) of the Act, the statute does not specify medicaldevices, surgical procedures, or diagnostic or therapeutic services thatshould be covered or excluded from coverage.The intention of Congress, at the time the Medicare Act was passed in 1965,was that Medicare would provide health care insurance to protect the elderlyor disabled from the substantial costs of acute health care services, principallyhospital care. The provision was designed generally to cover services ordinarilyfurnished by hospitals, SNFs, and physicians licensed to practice medicine.Congress understood that questions as to coverage of specific serviceswould invariably arise and would require a specific determination of coverageby those administering the program. Thus, it vested in the Secretary theauthority to make those determinations. Specifically, section 1862(a)(1)(A)of the Act prohibits payment for any expenses incurred for services ``which* * * are not reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment ofillness or injury or to improve the functioning of a malformed body member.''We have interpreted this statutory provision to exclude from Medicare coveragethose medical and health care services that are not demonstrated to besafe and effective by acceptable clinical evidence. We made a preliminaryjudgment with respect to certain food allergy testing and treatment proceduresin 1983, and on August 19, 1983, we published a proposed notice (48 FR37716) that announced our intention to exclude them from Medicare coverage.The procedures proposed for exclusion were the cytotoxic leukocyte test,sublingual, intracutaneous, and subcutaneous provocative and neutralizationtesting and neutralization therapy. In formulating the proposed coverageexclusions, we relied substantially on detailed evaluations and recommendationsprovided us by our consultants in the Public Health Service's NationalCenter for Health Care Technology (PHS/NCHCT), which concluded that thosetests and therapies should be considered experimental in the absence ofscientific evidence of their effectiveness. (Under a subsequent reorganization,one NCHCT function was transferred to the Office of Health Technology Assessment(OHTA). The process HCFA uses in making coverage decisions, including therole of OHTA, is described in a notice that was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on April 29, 1987 (52 FR 15560).)In response to the proposed notice of August 19, 1983 on the exclusionof certain food allergy testing and treatment procedures, we received over19,000 comments from members of the general public, medical laboratories,medical societies and other professional organizations, and members ofCongress. Almost all of the comments concerned whether Medicare shouldcover food allergy testing and treatment procedures and/or the effect ofthis coverage policy on other third party payers. (The responses to thesecomments were addressed in a notice that was published on July 5, 1985(50 FR 27691).) We referred the medical and scientific materials that wereceived on food allergy testing in response to the August 19, 1983 noticeto OHTA for review and analysis on December 5, 1983. OHTA responded onJanuary 11, 1984 that the additional submissions did not change the substance,conclusions, or in any way add new information which, if originally consideredby NCHCT, would have resulted in a different coverage recommendation. Thescientific studies and materials reviewed by OHTA are described in AppendixA of this notice.We published a notice of ruling on July 5, 1985 (50 FR 27691) that excludedonly cytotoxic leukocyte testing for food allergies from Medicare coverage.At that same time, we announced that we were still evaluating informationconcerning sublingual, intracutaneous, and subcutaneous provocative andneutralization tests, and neutralization therapy for food allergies.On February 12, 1986, we requested that OHTA once again review specificarticles on sublingual, intracutaneous, and subcutaneous provocative andneutralization tests and neutralization therapy for food allergies providedto us by proponents and determine whether they would suggest the need forreexamining the original NCHCT recommendations to not cover these foodallergy tests and therapies because they lacked scientific evidence ofeffectiveness. On March 4, 1986, OHTA reiterated its response of January11, 1984 about the procedures in question and added that these diagnosticand therapeutic modalities for food allergy are considered to be of unprovenefficacy. We accepted the information provided by OHTA in their March 4,1986 review, on the basis of the information and reasoning that appearsin Appendix B of this notice. We requested on April 17, 1986 that OHTAreview materials that we received subsequent to OHTA's recommendation ofMarch 4, 1986. On June 9, 1986, OHTA informed us that the additional materialsdid not change the substance, conclusions, nor in any way add new informationthat might result in a changed coverage recommendation. Appendix C of thisnotice contains a description of the material reviewed by OHTA in reachingthis decision.The American Medical Association's Council on Scientific Affairs issueda report in December 1986 titled ``Informational Report on In Vivo DiagnosticTesting and Immunotherapy for Allergy'' that reflected the views of scientificliterature as of that date. In discussing intracutaneous and subcutaneousprovocative tests and neutralization procedures and sublingual provocativetesting and neutralization procedures for the diagnosis and treatment offood allergies, the report stated that many investigators had attemptedto accomplish controlled trails of these procedures, but none of thesehad produced evidence of effectiveness. In the part, major difficultieshave been the reproducibility of results, nonstandardized allergenic extracts,nonhomogenous patient populations, and varying methods of quantifying outcomes.Moreover, at its May 1987 meeting, the Medical Advisory Panel of the BlueCross/Blue Shield Association stated that sublingual, intradermal (thatis, intracutaneous), and subcutaneous provocative and neutralization immunotherapiesare experimental and investigative in the management of food allergy.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Provisions of this Final Notice</ITAG>For the reasons stated in the Background section of this notice, we willexclude from Medicare coverage sublingual, intracutaneous, and subcutaneousprovocative and neutralization testing and neutralization therapy for foodallergies.We will issue instructions to HCFA fiscal intermediaries and carriers responsiblefor administering the Medicare program through the Coverage Issues Manual(HCFA Pub. 6).<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Regulatory Impact Statement</ITAG>Executive Order 12291 (E.O. 12291) requires us to prepare and publish afinal regulatory impact analysis for any final notice that meets one ofthe E.O. criteria for a ``major rule''; that is, that will likely resultin: An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; a major increasein costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal, State,or local government agencies, or geographic regions; or, significant adverseeffects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation,or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-basedenterprises in domestic or export markets.In addition, we generally prepare a final regulatory flexibility analysisthat is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C.601 through 612), unless the Secretary certifies that a final notice suchas this will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial numberof small entities. For purposes of the RFA, we treat all beneficiariesand providers as small entities.In the past, HCFA has allowed fiscal intermediaries and carriers the discretionto make coverage determinations regarding sublingual, intracutaneous, andsubcutaneous provocative and neutralization testing and neutralizationtherapy for food allergies based on case circumstances and their knowledgeof local practice patterns. We believe that publication of this noticewill establish a more uniform Medicare coverage policy with respect tothese services. While some beneficiaries may incur out-of-pocket expensesif they wish to receive these services in the future, available evidencedoes not indicate that these tests and therapies are effective. Therefore,we have determined that payment for these services is precluded under section1862(a)(1) of the Act.Some providers who routinely perform these tests and therapies will beaffected to a degree by this notice; however, since relatively few Medicarebeneficiaries receive these services, we do not believe that the numberof providers significantly affected will be substantial. Accordingly, webelieve that the impact of this notice both on Medicare program expendituresand on providers of services will be minimal.Many commenters in the past have expressed concern that private insurancecompanies might follow Medicare's lead and also exclude food allergy testingand treatments from coverage. While private health insurers sometimes adoptpolicies similar to those of Medicare, Medicare coverage policies are applicableonly to the Medicare program and have no statutory or regulatory relationshipto private insurers and other third party payers. Each private insurerdetermines whether or not these services are reimbursable based on itsown coverage guidelines.We are making this coverage decision on the basis of widely available medicalevidence, as well as our statutory authority and policy precedents. Thissame medical evidence may be weighed differently by other insurers in lightof their own guidelines. Thus, it would be speculative to attribute noncoverageof these services by any other insurer to this notice.For these reasons, we have determined that a regulatory impact analysisis not required. Further, we have determined, and the Secretary certifies,that this final notice will not have a significant economic impact on asubstantial number of small entities, and therefore we have not prepareda regulatory flexibility analysis.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Response to Comments</ITAG>We are affording the public an opportunity to comment on this notice sothat they may respond to our evaluation of the information we reviewedsubsequent to the August 19, 1983 notice (48 FR 37716). Because of thelarge number of comments we receive on notices such as this, we cannotacknowledge or respond to them individually. However, if we decide to publisha subsequent document in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, we will consider all comments received timelyand respond to the major issues in that document.<ITAG tagnum="84">V.

When symptoms have been provoked, neutralization is attemptedwith administration of a weak dilution of the same antigen using the sameroutes of administration. Dilution is varied until a ``neutralization dose''of antigen is ascertained that will provide relief of the symptoms. Neutralizationtreatment of food allergies involves administration of this neutralizingdose when identified allergenic foods are to be consumed. Varying recommendationsexist concerning frequency and route of administration. Intradermal skinwheal reactions have also been employed to assist in determining the neutralizingdose of food antigens.There has been considerable attention to the definition of ``food allergy''over many years of both scientific and popular literature. A recent editorialin the <T3>Lancet</T3> (1) deals with the longstanding tendency to represent allfood reactions, immunologically mediated or not, as ``allergies''. Traditionally,short-term reactions to foods due to IgE mediated allergy have typicallyincluded utricaria and angioedema, conjunctivitis, rhinitis, asthma, andsome gastrointestinal effects. The <T3>Lancet </T3>goes on to suggest that nonimmunological food reactionsare better referred to as ``food intolerance.'' These effects may variouslybe chemical, humoral, or due to enzymatic deficiency. Unfortunately, thereis little consensus concerning the identity and attribution to immunologicmechanisms of proported non-IgE mediated food reactions such as mentaldisorientation, anxiety, fatigue, hyperkinesis, and musculoskeletal pain.This, in turn, has fueled additional controversy concerning the place offood allergen immuno-therapy in the treatment of these conditions.Further debate has surrounded the evaluation of methods for diagnosingfood allergy. Recent work by Bernstein (2) and Sampson (3) has dealt withthe low correlation between Double Blind Food Challenge (DBFC), skin testing,Leukocyte Histamine Release (LHR), and the Radioallergosorbent Test (RAST)for allergic antibody. Traditionally, the DBFC has been most widely accepted(4). Because of the continuing dispute over the basic mechanisms and manifestationsof food allergy, any consensus concerning diagnostic methods has been elusive.Predictably, agreement upon effective treatment modalities for adversefood reactions remains highly controversial as a consequence of the etiologicaland diagnostic disputes noted.Assessments by NCHCT of the three food allergy procedures of concern werecompleted and released in 1981 with recommendations of noncoverage. TheAmerican Academy of Allergy concurently published a position statementendorsed by its Executive Committee and Committee on Unproved Technologiessuggesting the three procedures ``be reserved for experimental use (5).''A further review of ``Contreversial Practices in Allergy'' performed byGrieco as a special communication to the <T3>Journal of the American Medical Association </T3>(6) synthesizes theliterature on the three procedures concluding that there is a lack of adequateobjective evidence to support their routine clinical use. Rebuttal lettersto Grieco's review of provocation and neutralization from Miller (7) andPodell (8) were carried in subsequent issues of the JAMA and critiquedin turn by Grieco who found no reason to change his opinion based on thestudies they cited. Leukocytotoxicity assay was not supported by Podelland Miller. An editorial recently carried in the Western Journal of Medicine(9) found that ``controlled studies do not substantiate the claims of proponents''of cytotoxic testing for food allergy. An exhaustive review of the rational, efficacy, and safety of provocativetesting and neutralization therapy has been accomplished by Levin, Miller,and Weinstein (10). They clearly state the basic principle of provocation/neutralization_``Formost patients, a specific symptom-relieving therapeutic concentration foreach antigen extract exists and can be determined individually by skintesting.'' Multiple allergy can be tested by combining appropriate relievingdoses of all offending allergens in a single vial to be administered together.Sublingual and intradermal routes are said to be equally safe and effective.Past literature is referenced in supporting the use of provocation/neutralizationfor allergy mediated by IgE mechanisms as well as immune reactions mediatedby other factors. The diverse list they present of illnesses that respondto this therapy includes: ``aphthous stomatitis; chronic diarrhea; chroniculcerative colitis; atopic dermatitis; chronic urticaria; hyperkinesis;migraine; and some resistant respiratory inhalant syndromes including perennialallergic rhinitis, asthma, and recurrent laryngeal edema.'' Mention isalso made of the utility of these techniques for various syndromes andinfectious diseases such as resistant vaginal candidiasis, dysmenorrhea,and active viral infections as well as certain autoimmune diseases suchas lupus erythematosus. Sensitivity to allergens of foods, pets, toxicchemicals and ihnalants mediated by both IgE and non-IgE factors is implicated.Levin, et al. (10), emphasize there recent reports of double-blind clinicaltrials that support the efficacy of provocation/neutralization: The neutralizationtherapy of asthma due to animal dander by Boris (11), and two unpublishedstudies by Rea (12) and McGovern (13) respectively. The work by Rea isto appear in the March 1984, issue of <T3>Archives of Otholaryngology;</T3> the McGovern work has been submittedto the same journal with review still underway at this time. The Borisstudy deals with inhalant induced asthma and will not be mentioned further.Rea (12) studies 22 patients selected from 150 consecutive admissions tothe Environmental Care Unit, Lutheran Brookhaven Medical Systems Hospitalfor evaluation of suspected food sensitivites. To be included, a patientmust have exhibited ``asthma, urticaria, muscle, nerve or joint pain, headache,dizziness, or mental confusion'' within an hour of oral food challenge(OFC) among other selected criteria. Positive oral challenges were successfullyneutralized by intracutaneous antigen administration technique in 54 ofthe 150 patients; 22 consented to participate in the study. OFC of eachpatient was repeated on three subsequent occasions after double blind subcutaneousadministration of either a neutralizing does not antigen or a saline placebo.Observation of signs and symptoms as well as indices of cognition and discomfortwere recorded for each test episode. The identified symptom categoriesthat were provoked and neutralized included ``muscle and joint pain, headache,gastrointestinal discomfort and mental symptoms.'' The detailed recordof discrete signs and symptoms manifested before and after each OFC includesa much wider range of reactions present or absent in varying degree amongthe 22 subjects tested. Consistency between symptoms evoked on initialOFC upon admission to the study and those evoked with each subsequent OFCis also of concern. Based on favorable results produced by the subcutaneousadministration of a neutralizing does of food antigens, Rea concludes thatneutralization is a valid biological phenomenon. No conclusions are drawnwith respect to the immunologic effects of repeated neutralization doesinjections or duration of effect. This study presents interpretive difficultiesdue to intraindividual variations in signs and symptoms produced and neutralizedon initial and subsequent testing. There is also considerable interindividualvariation among the patients especially with respect to chief complaintsupon admission, and consequently, underlying clinical status. Spacing betweenindividual patient test episodes varied from two to four days. The effectof this variation on the statistical independences of each such event isnot stated. McGovern, in the study cited by Levin (13), evaluates the disgnostic utilityand therapeutic value of the provocative challenge and neutralizing dosephenomenon. The research was carried out in two phases; first the reproducibilityof intradermal provocative tests and placebo effects, then the double-blindevaluation of neutralizing dose therapy after provocative challenge andlaboratory observation of immune response. The first phase involved selectionof six patients demonstrating positive systemic reactions to various allergenicextract dilutions administered intracutaneously.  Three were thus tested with perennial rye grass, one with ``corn'', onewith petroleum-derived ethanol, and two with phenol. Symptoms that wereprovoked ranged from hyperkinesis to semnolence, cognitive disruption andcephalalgia, conjunctivitis, rhinorrhea and coryza. A double-blind testingprocedure was then accomplished whereby each of the six subjects were testedwith randomly administered intradermal challenges of antigen or a salineplacebo and their responses recorded and compared. Three of the subjectsand three matched normal controls were retested one week later and laboratoryimmunologic testing performed to evaluate the effect of provocative challenge.The second phase of their study involved 10 patients known to be clinicallysensitive to various foods and chemicals based on ``demonstrated neurologicreactions after provocative testing'' one year before. Seven differentsubstances were employed with no more than one being administered to eachpatient. A varying schedule of provoking and placebo injections was employedon the patients and 10 sex matched normal controls who were evaluated clinicallyafter each intervention. Clinical improvement was identified among theexperimental group upon administration of a neutralizing dose of specifiedallergen or hapten. Variations of cellular and humoral response were alsoidentified after provocative challenge. Although McGovern claims statisticallysignificant results supporting the efficacy of provocative/neutralizationtesting and neutralization therapy, the small number of patients and largenumber of variables involved make interpretation of his data quite difficult. Levin (10) additionally cites a study by King (14) that tests the efficacyof sublingual provocation in producing cognitive and emotional symptomsas well as somatic effects by allergic mechanisms. Ten patients, each withat least one psychological presenting symptom, were involved. No controlgroup was used. Food substances were randomly tried on each subject withinterspersed placebo trials. Double-blind precautions were taken and subjectslisted and rated their reactions. Neutalization was not a feature of thisstudy. King finds significantly greater cognitive-emotional symptoms followingsublingual administration of specific allergens than on placebo trials.Again, this study deals with a markedly heterogenous population of patientssensitive to an extremely varied number of substances. The author's statedconclusions are difficult to interpret. It is noted that Levin mistakenlydates this work by King in 1982; it was actually published in early 1981and has been critiqued in the literature (8).  The additional clinical trials of provocation/neutralization that Levincites either do not concern food allergy or are not of double-blind design.Some, published before 1982, were already considered by the Public HealthService and have been acknowledged in the scientific literature.  An extensive review of immunological principle and theory is conductedby Levin (10) concerning the biochemical nature of IgE and non-IgE mediatedfood sensitivity. Because of the theoretical nature of this discussionand the spirited debate that currently surrounds the data cited, the PublicHealth Service will await the results of further well-designed biomedicalresearch before attempting to comment on the immunological processes andreactions that have been postulated.  In the section of his comprehensive work entitled ``Critique of the OpponentsCase Against Provocation/Neutralization,'' Levin (10) notes the absenceof bibliographic reference to a number of supportive studies. It is feltthat the works cited are already well acknowledged in the scientific literaturewith their contributions adequately incorporated into the commentariesof both proponents and opponents. Levin (15) regrets the release of NCHCTassessments recommending experimental status for both sublingual and intradermal/subcutaneousprovocation neutralization testing and neutralization therapy ``before3 of the strongest double-blind studies in support of provocation/neutralizationhad been published. Yet no attempt has been made to incorporate the newdata into HCFA's rulemaking.'' The three studies, Boris (11), Rea (12),and McGovern (13), as has been noted, variusly have not yet been publishedor do not involve food allergy (11).  In an appendix to Levin's commentary, D.S. King prepared a ``Critical Analysisof the Controlled Research'' on intradermal/sublingual provocative testing(16) that is of interest from several points of view. Neutralization isspecifically excluded from consideration with respect to diagnostic andtherapeutic effect. Further, he states that ``Practitioners of sublingualtesting have not conducted well-controlled evaluation of its reliabilityand validity, relying instead on anecdotal reports and clinical impressions(17).'' An extensive review of the principal studies critical of intradermalprovocation is performed by King and their research design is questionedon grounds of reliability and validity. Studies favorable to intradermalprovocation are in large part not analyzed.  Dr. Richard N. Podell composed an extensive letter to HCFA reviewing thescientific literature concerning provocation/neutralization methods fordiagnosing and treating food allergies (18). He cites certain studies completedsince the 1981 issuance of the NCHCT report as supportive of provocation/neutralizationand requests their consideration. Podell states that ``The following studieswere not discussed in the NCHCT report. By inference they were not consideredby those proposing the rule to exclude these procedures from coverage (19).He then presents the research of Boris (11), Rea (12), and McGovern (13)as ``the most rigorous evaluations of neutralization (19)'' from an experimentaldesign perspective. As noted above, one of these works deal with inhalant(not food) allergy, and the other two have not yet been published. Thework of D.S. King (14) is also cited although, as noted, neutralizationis not covered and emphasis was on causation of psychological symptomsby food allergens. Surprisingly, in the unpublished draft of a 1983 article,also submitted to HCFA (20), Podell expresses disappointment at the qualityof both the favorable and unfavorable provocation/neutralization literatureciting design flaws and lack of full scientific formality in the reportingof results. He concludes by affirming the justification for ``the effortto design and implement further, and more definitive double blind evaluations(21).''The American Academy of Otolaryngic Allergy also submitted its commentsto HCFA in response to the proposed Medicare coverage exclusion of intracutaneousand subcutaneous provocative food allergy testing, and neutralization therapyfollowing these procedures (22). Sublingual techniques and the leukocytotoxictest are not included in their request for favorable coverage action. Acomprehensive review of provocative/neutralization technology is accomplishedwith emphasis on both prevailing practices and debate among allergists,as well as a detailed presentation of underlying immunologic theory. TheAcademy calls particular attention to the work of Miller, in 1977 (23),which is said to be ``the most scientific and accurate study considered''in the NCHCT Assessment Report. We are referred to the comments of Podellwith respect to Miller, (20). However, Podell raises the issue of possiblelapses in double-blinding and the subjective nature of symptom reportingin Miller's work. He concludes that ``the Miller study leaves the readerwith residual uncertainty (24).'' Since only 8 patients were involved,the findings of Miller's ``preliminary report'' continue to be debated(7). A more traditional approach to food allergy that was counter to Miller'shypotheses was presented by May and Block in 1978 (25). A recent unpublishedstudy by Johnson and Rea (26) is cited by the Academy as clinical of thecorrelation between provocative skin testing and oral food challenges.A lack of confirmatory correlation with radioallergosorbent test (RAST)results is believed to indicate non-IgE mediated allergy. This study, however,has neither double-blinding nor a control group. Further, reference tothe new works by Boris (11), Rea (12), and McGovern (13) is made by theAcademy of Otolarynic Allergy as illustrative of modern provocation/neutralizationtechniques. The scientific basis of provocative/neutralization testing and neutralizationtherapy remains elusive. Postulated attribution of diverse non-IgE mediatedfood reactions to skin and sublingual challenge with food antigens remediedby subsequent therapy with greater dilutions of the same antigens continuesto be debated as does the evidence that psychological or behavioral abnormalitiesmay be due to food allergy. Proponents of provocation/neutralization haverelied on the results of research studies that have involved small numbersof heterogeneous subjects manifesting a rather diverse set of events saidto be immunologically caused. There continues to be a lack of systematicresearch design and hypothesis formation concerning the mechanisms andmanifestations of food hypersensitivity underlying the rationale for provocation/neutralizationtechnology. <ITAG tagnum="74">References</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Lancet; Food Allergy-Editorial; 1979, V.1: 249-250.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Bernstein, M., Day, J.H., Welsh, A.; Double-blind Food Challengein the Diagnosis of Food Sensitivity in the Adult; J.

Rea,et al. reported their results in 20 patients treated with subcutaneousneutralizing doses of food extracts to remedy a diverse list of complaintsascribed to allergic hypersensitivity (2). This study was included in unpublishedform as part of OHTA's previous review. The same concerns about the studythat were expressed earlier continue to prevail. Twenty patients with quiteheterogeneous symptoms were involved, and serious methodologic flaws inthe study design, including blinding and randomization, were present.In January 1986, Terr published an evaluation of 50 patients in whom environmentalillness was diagnosed by 16 clinical ecologists (1). Provocation/neutralizationtesting had been used to make the diagnosis in 41 of these cases. Terrreviewed the 50 patients and found that they had extremely heterogeneoushistories with no consistent physical findings or laboratory abnormalities.He concluded that this group of patients ``had characteristic symptomsof psychosomatic illness, but this study does not support the clinicalecology theory that psychosomatic illness may be an expression of foodand chemical sensitivities induced by the toxic effect of environmentalchemicals on the immune system.'' The author found it unlikely that thediagnostic and therapeutic methods of clinical ecology, including provocation-neutralization,can uncover and relieve disease. Panush and Webster reviewed the topic of food allergies in 1985 (3). Theyconcluded, based on an analysis of available data, that ``cytotoxic testing,leukopenia index, and provocative sublingual or subcutaneous testing areall considered unproven.''The Scientific Board Task Force on Clinical Ecology of the California MedicalAssociation published its findings in February 1985 (4). This criticalappraisal was based on testimony from proponents as well as an exhaustivereview of the published and unpublished scientific literature. It was reportedthat ``No convincing evidence was found that patients treated by clinicalecologists have unique recognizable syndromes, that the diagnostic testsemployed are efficacious and reliable or that the treatments are effective.''Specific reference was made to methodologic flaws in Rea's study citedabove (4).<ITAG tagnum="74">References</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Terr AI.

The statement was adopted by the Academy's Board of Directorsin 1984. No additional clinical data were appended to support this position.The American Academy of Otolaryngic Allergy submitted a restatement ofits position supporting the utility of intracutaneous and subcutaneousprovocative and neutralization testing and treatment for food allergiesthat was prepared on March 27, 1986 (2). These comments reiterate the positionof the Academy which was previously submitted to HCFA in 1983 (3). Variouspublished and unpublished materials were appended. These included a 1977study of food extract injection therapy by Miller and a 1983 study of foodextract injection in the elimination of oral food challenge reactions byRea that had already been reviewed by OHTA (4, 5). Two studies of respiratoryallergy to animal dander by Boris and associates were appended, which representcontinuations of Boris' earlier work on this topic (6, 8). These studiesconcern the neutralization of IgE mediated respiratory symptoms after bronchoprovocationchallenge with animal dander antigen.Three studies of the possible role of food allergy in migraine were submittedby the American Academy of Otolaryngic Allergy in support of their position(9-11). These reports concern conventional oral challenge testing methodsfor IgE mediated food allergy involving elimination diets and sequentialreintroduction of suspect foods. As such, they do not address the safetyand efficacy of food extract injection techniques. Two published lecturespresented by Dr. William T. Kniker were also submitted (12, 13). Thesepapers are expository in nature and do not offer additional clinical data.Food extract injection techniques were not addressed.Two unpublished, undated papers on food allergy by Dr. Richard J. Trevinowere submitted (14, 15). No additional relevant clinical data were presented.The American Academy of Otolaryngic Allergy also submitted an ``IntradermalProvocative Food Testing Protocol.'' It was stated that the Academy's ResearchCommittee is undertaking a ``nationwide multicenter sixty patient double-blindclinical study of both intradermal provocative food testing and neutralizationtherapy'' based on this protocol (2). No clinical data were offered.<ITAG tagnum="74">References</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. Goldstein JC.
