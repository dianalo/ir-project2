Chris Elliot, chief China conservationist of the World Wide Fundfor Nature International, said at a news conference his group andChina recognize ``that what we've done so far is not sufficient.''   China, the only country where pandas live in the wild, estimatesthat fewer than 1,000 remain, threatened by deforestation andpoachers who sell the black and white skins.   China has stiff penalties for panda poaching, including the deathpenalty. Elliot said his group and the Chinese Forestry Ministryhave come up with a plan calling for increased patrolling of pandareserves and better training for the guards.   The plan is expected to be submitted to the State Council, orCabinet, next year, and ``it will be a blow if the State Councildoesn't ratify anything,'' Elliot said.</TEXT></DOC>
