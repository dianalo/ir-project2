Ric Berman, a director of Pine Street Investment Ltd., a London-based AIG affiliate, said AIG accumulated most of its 7,016,110 shares since January at prices between 370 pence and 390 pence ($7.25) a share.    Kleinwort, Britain's second-largest independent merchant banking and securities house, has been talked about as a possible takeover target. The AIG stake likely will rekindle some speculation in the stock.    But a takeover appears unlikely, analysts said, because family interests still control one-fourth of Kleinwort shares and regulators probably would block a hostile bid. Aside from AIG, Kleinwort family members and trusts are the only investors with more than 5% holdings, according to David Peake, chairman of Kleinwort Benson Ltd., Kleinwort's merchant-banking unit.    On news of AIG's stake, Kleinwort shares rose 13 pence to 383 pence yesterday on London's stock exchange, valuing the stake at #26.9 million.    New York-based AIG views its Kleinwort investment as a long-term portfolio holding in an undervalued stock, Mr. Berman said. It &quot;has confidence in (Kleinwort's) current management strategy.&quot; He added: &quot;AIG has not made this as a prelude to an acquisition.&quot; AIG may boost its stake, he said, but by no more than &quot;a couple&quot; of percentage points.    The Pine Street Investment executive said AIG makes other investments in the British financial services industry and recently acquired less than 5% of financial services group MAI PLC. Mr. Berman declined to identify other investments.    Mr. Peake said AIG's shareholding is &quot;completely, absolutely friendly.&quot; He declined to comment on how Kleinwort would view an increased stake. Mr. Peake indicated he regards AIG's stake as friendlier than the 4.9% bought in 1985 and sold early last year by Greenwich, Conn.-based American Can Co., now known as Primerica Corp.    Primerica Chairman Gerald Tsai expressed interest in buying shares beyond the 4.9% level in 1986, fueling speculation about a possible takeover. But the companies reached a gentleman's agreement that the holding would stay at 4.9%. Last year, Japanese insurer Sumitomo Life Insurance Co. acquired about 1.5% of Kleinwort. </TEXT></DOC>
