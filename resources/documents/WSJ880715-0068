Stevens (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> CMD PCS PET </IN><TEXT>   Silver continued to strengthen along with soybean prices, but gold eased as a result of a stronger dollar and a report that Taiwan will suspend U.S. purchases of the precious metal.    Silver also benefited from reports of a possible work stoppage by Peruvian miners beginning next week. Silver for current delivery climbed 11.5 cents an ounce to $7.28.    July gold slipped $1.70 an ounce to $438.70. July platinum rose 10 cents an ounce to $551.50.    Gold, which is a popular alternative investment when the dollar is in decline, tends to suffer when the U.S. currency is rebounding. &quot;Gold has been following the dollar more than silver, and silver has been following soybeans more than gold,&quot; Richard Hirsch, a metals broker at Gerald Commodities Inc., New York, said. He added that some investors may be selling gold to buy silver.    According to a news report from Taiwan, the government there has decided to temporarily halt its U.S. precious metal purchases after Washington described the buying as a strategy to artificially reduce Taipei's huge trade surplus with the U.S.    &quot;We have suspended buying gold from the U.S. for the time being,&quot; Taiwanese central bank Gov. Chang Chi-cheng told reporters. A senior central bank official described the U.S. criticism as unfair because Taiwan had removed gold and silver from foreign exchange controls in 1987 and now regards precious metals as commodities instead of reserves.    Analysts said that the extent of the impact of the news was unclear and that today's U.S. merchandise trade report, and the dollar's reaction to it, was of greater concern to traders. &quot;People are reserving judgment (on gold) until the trade numbers,&quot; Bernard Savaiko, senior precious metals analyst at Paine Webber Inc., New York, said.    Taiwan's gold imports from October 1987 to April 1988 more than doubled the island's official bullion reserves to 12.3 million ounces this year from 5.63 million ounces in September 1987, according to the central bank.    Gold imports by the private sector show signs of increasing since the government on July 1 removed a 5% sales tax on dealings in the precious metal in Taiwan, according to people in the bullion trade.    The island may become the world's largest gold importer this year after Japan with estimated purchases of 300 tons, a Japanese bullion dealer said. He put Japan's imports at about 350 tons.    In other commodity markets yesterday:   SUGAR: Buying in the Tokyo market early yesterday spurred prices in the U.S. to a seven-year high, analysts said. Analysts attributed much of the buying to merchandisers who recently made large sales in the physical market and are seeking to protect themselves from future price increases. &quot;But the fundamentals are there&quot; for a runup in sugar prices, Steve Chronowitz, head of futures research at Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co., New York, said. &quot;Demand is good and supply could be a problem, and that's enough to keep the market going,&quot; he said. Sugar for October delivery gained 0.71 cents an ounce to 15.27 cents.    ENERGY: Trading reached a record volume of 31,548 in gasoline futures, up from the old record of 29,021 set June 24. After trading in a wide range, gasoline for August delivery rose to 50.54 cents a gallon from 50.48 cents. Gasoline demand remains suprisingly strong and the widening price differential against other energy contracts has led to huge &quot;spread&quot; volume, or trading in two markets simultaneously. In volatile trading, West Texas Intermediate crude for August delivery rose 32 cents to $14.76 a barrel.    ORANGE JUICE: The contract for July delivery closed up 1.3 cents a pound to a new high of $1.93. Analysts said the price rise reflects tight supplies, partly because of a curtailment of shipments by Brazil, a major producer. Despite its relatively high price, orange juice demand remains strong because many retailers are swallowing the wholesale cost increases to keep prices stable for consumers and thus retain market share, said Mr. Chronowitz, the head of futures research at Smith Barney. &quot;If they were to raise prices at retail, they might choke off demand,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
