Appropriate organisms werechosen for two different test procedures: Using mortality as a test criterionan acute toxicity test can be carried out very easy with larvae of thebrine shrimp Artemia sp. The sensitivity for different dispersants rangesover several orders of magnitude. Another test indicator is the cellmultiplication-inhibition test, conducted with the microalga Scrippsiellatrochoidea, a representative of phytoplankton. The sensitivity for acommon dispersant ranges a hundredfold higher than the acute toxicitytest. Both test procedures are also practicable for other water-solublesubstances, as well. One oil-spill dispersant efficiency test is proposedprovisionally. (orig.) With 62 refs., 20 tabs., 11 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
