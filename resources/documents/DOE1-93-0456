That is a consequence of the low rate profile of the Italiannuclear plant development compared with other OECD countries. At thebeginning of 1986 two new major factors arose in the Italian contextwith the primary aim of setting up the basis of a consistent and finalizedpolicy in the field of waste management. The general content and thephilosophy of the Technical Guide n. 26 has been presented at the ANSconference meeting, held in Niagara Falls - September 1986. The secondstep was the issuing of the Technial Position 1.26 (T.P. 1.26). The papermainly deals with this latter document. The T.P. 1/26 is aimed at identifyingthe objectives, the format and the general content of a Qualificationand Control Programme (Q.C.P.) for radioactive waste conditioning systems.The overall objective of a Q.C.P., as stated by T.P. 1/26, is to givedemonstration of the capability of a conditioning system to produce conditionedwastes in compliance with a set of specified criteria and requirements,avoiding tests to be made on conditioned waste packages.</TEXT></DOC>
