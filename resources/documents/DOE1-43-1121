<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-43-1121 </DOCNO><TEXT>Experimental results on the nature of intrinsic defects and estimationof their concentration are presented for two model materials, CdTe andPbTe, which are typical, commonly used semiconductors of the II-VI andIV-VI types. The full volume concentrations of electrically charged andneutral intrinsic defects are estimated by using a complex of independentexperimental techniques, with a subsequent combined analysis of the results.Methods for controlling deviations from stoichiometry involving controlledannealing and doping are examined. 200 references.</TEXT></DOC>
