No arrests or injuries were reported in Sunday's confrontation.   The roughly 400 protesters, many with their faces covered, wereamong about 5,000 people who had marched on the joint-use base,police said. March organizers estimated the crowd at 15,000.   The marchers, who also shouted anti-NATO slogans, walked nearly10 miles to the base from the town of Puerto de Santa Maria. TheAtlantic Coast base is about 50 miles north of the Strait ofGibraltar.   The march was organized by regional pacifist groups.   Spain and the United States signed a new eight-year pact on Dec.1 that mandates removal of 72 U.S. F-16 fighter bombers fromSpanish soil by 1992. But it permits continued U.S. use of threemilitary bases, including Rota.   The new agreement reduces the maximum number of U.S. troopsallowed to be stationed in Spain by 36 percent, from 12,545 to8,078.   Though a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Spainremains outside the alliance's military command structure.</TEXT></DOC>
