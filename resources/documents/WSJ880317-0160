Dr. David W. Smith, 56 years old, Praxis chairman and the holder of a 47.6% stake, took the action after the vaccine maker's five other directors refused to reinstate him as president and chief executive officer.    Praxis said it will go along with Dr. Smith's demand for the meeting.    In an interview, the Praxis executive said he decided to take control of the company because of what he described as dissension among the company's scientists.    &quot;There are concerns on the part of the scientific staff with regard to the focus, the budgetary priorities and the timing of project development,&quot; Dr. Smith said. He added that he felt the company had strayed from its original strategy.    Dr. Smith resigned Dec. 31 from the posts of president and chief executive for reasons that aren't fully clear, although he acknowledged that it involved a dispute with the board. Praxis doesn't currently have a president, but Dr. Franklin H. Top Jr., an executive vice president, is acting chief executive. </TEXT></DOC>
