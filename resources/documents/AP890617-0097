Other items on the agenda for the AMA's House of Delegatesmeeting include whether life support should be withheld forvegetative patients, required cholesterol and sodium content labelson food products, random drug testing of athletes, and numerousresolutions on how to battle AIDS.   The 433 delegates, representing state medical associations,physicians, medical students and hospital medical staffs nationwide,act as a legislature for the nearly 300,000-member association,setting policy for the nation's largest doctors' group. The five-daymeeting begins Sunday.   Delegates will receive nearly 300 reports and proposedresolutions on topics ranging from fraud in scientific research tothe hazards of wearing portable radios.   The House of Delegates will vote during the convention on whetherto adopt the proposals as official AMA policy.   The association's board of trustees, its governing body, isrecommending that state medical associations lobby for increasinglegal alternatives for medically incompetent patients on lifesupport systems.   The trustees recommend encouraging legislatures in the 40 stateswithout a ``durable power of attorney health care statute'' to enactthe measure, which allows people to authorize others to take legallybinding action on their behalf _ including removing life support.   The trustees also recommend that ``physicians encourage theirpatients to document their wishes regarding the use oflife-prolonging medical treatments.''   A joint report from the AMA's Council on Scientific Affairs andCouncil on Ethical and Judicial Affairs encourages continued federalfunding for fetal tissue transplants, which they say have led tosignificant medical advances.   The councils address opposition from abortion opponents who fearthe possibility that a woman's decision to have an abortion willbecome coupled with a decision to donate fetal tissue.   ``Safeguards to reduce any motivation, reason or incentive by thewoman to have an abortion can be developed,'' they wrote.   Delegates from Michigan have proposed the AMA seek legislationbanning the sale or ownership of assault rifles.   ``A major purpose of assault rifles is to kill people,'' theirresolution says. ``The medical profession has an obligation topromote programs and attitudes to safeguard the health andwell-being of the community.''   The trustees recommend that the AMA endorse a plan that wouldrequire businesses to provide health insurance coverage for allemployees.   The proposal would begin with larger employers, and be phased into include smaller ones. It would also establish a program ofdiminishing tax credits ``or other incentives to avoid adverseeffects on employers.''   Other recommendations include:   _Routine AIDS testing of newborns in areas where the disease isprevalent.   _Recording tobacco use on death certificates.   _Removing provisions in child abuse laws that allow parents towithhold proper medical attention from their children on religiousgrounds.   _Making possession of steroids for other than medical purposes afelony.   _Discouraging the use of infant walkers, which critics link tothousands of injuries each year.   _Allowing physicians who treat the indigent to have income taxdeductions.</TEXT></DOC>
