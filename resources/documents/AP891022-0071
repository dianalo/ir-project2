On Sunday, entry to the Catholicchurch was barred by barbed wire fences and parishioners had to sayMass down the street at a Baptist church.   ``I need to cry. I need to let go,'' said Ona Solom, an acolyteof the church. ``It's a heavy burden on the heart. But we'regrateful to come here.''   ``A building is important,'' said the Rev. James Keeley. ``Butpeople _ they're more important.''   As about 100 parishioners gathered for the service, someautomatically looked _ in vain _ for familiar seats.   ``Sometimes in life, God shakes us and says `Pay attention,there is something more important than the ordinary things in yourlife,''' Father Joseph M. Powers told the worshipers.   Religious groups in the San Francisco area were coordinatingactivities after the earthquake, taking collections and enlistingvolunteers to help their congregations and other earthquake victims.   A group of Protestant churches has started a counseling servicein which ministers will visit those who call feeling anxious.   A Christian men's group meeting here Saturday set up sign-upsheets for people who want to volunteer their skills to rebuild orrepair people's homes.   ``We don't want to offer just prayers and comfort. We want tooffer something more. We want to help people any way they needit,'' said the Rev. David Kiteley.   In San Francisco, Roman Catholic Archbishop John R. Quinn led700 worshipers at St. Mary's Cathedral in prayers for those who hadsuffered in the earthquake.   ``I weep for the parents, for the elderly, for the children,''Quinn said. ``I pray for the relief of suffering and anxiety.''</TEXT></DOC>
