The report, released yesterday by the New York StateJudicial Commission on Minorities, describes the courts as&quot;infested with racism.&quot; It concludes that minorities are farless likely than whites to be represented by attorneys, toserve on juries or to receive favorable action from thecourts. It notes that while 82% of the prison population isnonwhite, 81% of court personnel is white.</LP><TEXT>   According to the report, most black litigators in New Yorkcourts say they are frequently confronted by court personnelwho assume they are not lawyers. That may be because so fewof the lawyers -- and even fewer of the top attorneys -- areblack; of the 4,086 partners in large law firms in the state,only 30 are minorities, the report says.   Part of the problem seems to be that such a low percentageof minority law students pass the bar exam, a requirement forpractice in the state. Between 1985 and 1988, the passingrate for blacks was 31%, for Native Americans 33%, and forHispanics 40%. During the same period, the passing rate forwhites was 73.1%. The commission recommended adoptingstatewide a version of the Bar Association of the City of NewYork's minority tutorial program, which has increasedminority passing rates over the past 10 years.   As evidence of overt racism, the New York report foundthat 14% of all litigators surveyed by the commission saidthat judges, attorneys, or courtroom personnel publiclyrepeat ethnic jokes, use racial epithets or make demeaningremarks about a minority group often or very often. Another23% said that type of talk occurs sometimes. The report alsosaid that minority attorneys are subjected to humilatingjokes and racial stereotyping by opposing counsel and judges.   The commission's study is part of an effort coordinated bythe National Consortium of Commissions and Task Forces onRacial/Ethnic Bias in the Court. According to theconsortium's spokesman, Charles Z. Smith, a judge on theWashington State Supreme Court, Florida, New Jersey,Michigan, Hawaii and Washington state have issued similarreports within the last five years.   &quot;The findings have been essentially the same,&quot; Judge Smithsaid. &quot;There is a tendency toward noninclusion as opposed todeliberate exclusion of African-Americans, Latinos, Hispanicsand Asians.&quot;   The New York commission recommended more than 70 measures,including cross-cultural sensitivity training for courtpersonnel, a plan to recruit minority students into theprofession and ways to boost the number of minorities pickedfor juries.   ---   TV MINISERIES theme music was plagiarized, jury says.   The musical theme from the television miniseries &quot;TheWinds of War&quot; was illegally copied from an amateur composer'smanuscript, a Los Angeles federal court jury found.   The verdict means that the original composer can claim apercentage of the revenues earned from the show by defendantsParamount Communications Inc., whose Paramount Pictures Corp.unit produced the miniseries, and Capital Cities/ABC Inc.,whose ABC television network aired the series in 1983.   The original composer, John Woodbridge, of Deerfield,Ill., has also filed claims for unspecified damages andlicensing fees, contending that defendant Bob Cobert owes himat least a share of the $500,000 fee that Mr. Cobert was paidfor selling the song to the producers.   Under current law in most federal jurisdictions,plaintiffs in music plagiarism cases must prove that thesongs in question are at least substantially similar, andthat the defendants had access to the earlier piece. In the&quot;Winds of War&quot; case, the jury found that the works werevirtually identical, said Los Angeles lawyer Michael Polin,who represented Mr. Woodbridge.   Lawsuits by little-known composers alleging that they arethe true authors of popular tunes are very common, lawyerssaid. &quot;Every time a song makes it big, someone comes out ofthe woodwork claiming he wrote it first. The outcome turns onthe facts,&quot; said Stephen Barnett, a professor at theUniversity of California, Berkeley, School of Law.   In a famous 1976 court decision, a federal court judgeruled that ex-Beatle George Harrison had unconsciouslyplagiarized the song &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; from a previous hittitled &quot;He's So Fine.&quot; More recently, in 1988, the SecondU.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York upheld a jury'sfinding that the 1973 hit &quot;Feelings,&quot; by Morris Albert, wascopied from a song written during the 1950s by a Frenchcomposer.   A Paramount spokesman said that the entertainment companywas &quot;very disappointed in the ruling&quot; by the Los Angeles juryand intended to appeal it.   ---   LIBEL CLAIM against Glamour dismissed in Foretich case.   Earlier, the court threw out most of the libel claims in alawsuit filed by Eric A. Foretich alleging that a Glamourmagazine article left the false impression that he hadsexually abused his daughter, as claimed by his ex-wife,Elizabeth Morgan. Mr. Foretich has denied any abuse.   In a decision yesterday, U.S. District Judge GerhardGesell of Washington, D.C., dismissed the one remaining libelclaim stemming from a reader's letter and editor's notepublished in the January 1989 issue. Conde Nast PublicationsInc., a unit of Advance Publications Inc., publishes Glamour.   The judge did allow Mr. Foretich's mother to proceed withher libel and emotional-distress claim, and a trial isscheduled to begin June 24.   ---   BLUE JEANS BATTLE pits Jordache against Levi Strauss.   In federal court in Manhattan, Jordache Enterprises Inc.filed a lawsuit asking the court to declare that JordacheBasics 101 doesn't infringe on Levi Strauss andamp; Co.'s flagship&quot;501&quot; brand name. In the lawsuit, Jordache claims that Leviearlier this year threatened to take legal action against thecompany if it didn't drop the &quot;101&quot; line.   A spokesman for Levi, of San Francisco, declined tocomment.   Jordache said in the suit that it has been making itsBasics 101 apparel since 1988. The New York-based companysaid in the suit that consumers are unlikely to be confusedby the two brands, and it asked the court to bar Levi frominterfering with its use of the &quot;101&quot; name.   &quot;There is a strong public interest in allowing companiesother than Levi to use numerals such as `101' in associationwith their apparel products,&quot; the suit said.</TEXT></DOC>
