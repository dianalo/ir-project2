Gen. Zeev Livne, assistant toIsrael's military chief of operations, told a tense nation onIsrael television late last night. &quot;We hope that the wholesystem there was hit and will be destroyed in the nearfuture.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Shortly after last night's attack began, Israel declared anational emergency and ordered its citizens to stay indoors,as Israelis waited anxiously to see whether Iraq's SaddamHussein would make good on his threat to lob Scud missileswith chemical warheads toward Tel Aviv.   After the attack began, Israel told its citizens toprepare their gas-mask kits in case of a chemical weaponsattack. The Israeli government said that only citizens withemergency jobs should leave their homes. Most citizens stayedin front of their television sets, as announcers, seated infront of a backdrop of stars and stripes, intermittentlyaired Cable News Network. The lone Israeli television stationon the air showed President Bush's speech on the attack inits entirety.   &quot;There is always a danger that a lone launcher here orthere will send a missile in our direction, and we are readyfor that possibility&quot; Gen. Livne said.   From the outset of the Persian Gulf crisis, Israel hasbeen the wild card. As the U.S.-led attack began last night,Israel continued to maintain its low profile, staying out ofthe fighting.   The big question is whether the Israelis will remain onthe sidelines, as they did before fighting began, or whetherthey will insert themselves into the war on a large scale.Israel's actions could depend on whether Saddam Hussein triesto draw it into the war. Among Washington's biggest concerns:an Israeli attack on Jordan's air force, probably intended toprotect Israeli warplanes flying over that Arab state on areprisal raid on Baghdad; a ground war in Jordan betweenIsraeli and Iraqi forces; or even an Israeli effort, inspiredby extremists in the Jewish state, to take over Jordan andmake it a Palestinian homeland.   Most Arab coalition partners have told the U.S. privatelythey would accept an effort by Israel to defend itselfagainst an Iraqi attack. But a wholesale Israeli attack woulddrive a wedge between the U.S. and its Arab allies in thecoalition battling Iraq.   For Washington, this would be a nightmare the U.S. hassought to avert since the crisis began.   For Israel, it would be no nightmare. By splitting theanti-Iraq coalition, Israel might head off pressure from theU.S. and Washington's Arab allies to make concessions toPalestinians once the war ends. Moreover, Jerusalem isconfident it can inflict terrible damage on Iraq, its avowedfoe.   Still, in the weeks leading up to the war, Israeli PrimeMinister Yitzhak Shamir was unusually restrained in hiscomments, particularly about his neighbor, Jordan. But evensome Israelis say that an Iraqi attack on their populationwould create domestic pressures that could get out of controlquickly. &quot;If you are talking about an unconditional attack onIsrael,&quot; reserve Gen. Benjamin Peled, who commanded Israel'sair force in the 1970s, said, &quot;There will be such anemotional outcry that nobody will dare to stand against uswhen we go on a rampage.&quot;   Meanwhile, even defensive military moves by Israel couldcreate problems for the U.S.'s Arab partners. According toIsraeli military sources, an Israeli attack on Baghdad wouldrequire flights and mid-air refueling over Jordan. Thesesources say Israel would communicate to Jordan that it didn'thave any quarrel with the kingdom. But a military source saidthat if Jordan carried out its vow to try to prevent flightsover its territory, Israel's air force would attack.   Perhaps the deepest concern expressed by U.S. officialsinvolve any ground war in Jordan. They fear that Iraq, in aneffort to draw Israel in and split the coalition arrayedagainst it, might move either missile launchers or troopsinto Jordan. Israel has repeatedly said it would considersuch steps to be acts of war. Israel most likely wouldrespond by moving its troops into Jordan. The result could bethe end of King Hussein's reign and a period of instability.   Graham Fuller, a former Mideast analyst for the CentralIntelligence Agency, warned that the anti-Iraq coalitioncould fall apart if &quot;it looks like Israel is taking advantageof the war to pursue its private agenda;&quot; for example, bydeporting huge numbers of Palestinians or moving forces intoJordan under the pretext that it needs to restore order. SomeIsraeli extremists have long claimed that Jordan should bethe Palestinian homeland.   Mr. Fuller, now an analyst at Rand Corp., says that suchactions &quot;would leave an extremely ugly legacy after the warif it were perceived in the Arab world that we knew of, ordid nothing about, Israel's plans to take advantage of thesituation.&quot;   Furthermore, such actions would make it more difficult toput the pieces back together in the Mideast when the warends.   William Quandt, a Mideast specialist at the BrookingsInstitution, said that after the war, the U.S. might try topersuade Israel and Syria, a member of the coalition, tobegin talks about arms control and other security issues.Syria might be amenable to such talks, Mr. Quandt believes.But he added, &quot;If Israel has massively intervened, ratherthan just reacted to an Iraqi attack, it's hard to imaginethat Syria would be ready to sit down with a country thatjust clobbered a bunch of its Arab cousins.&quot;   ---   Peter Waldman in Jerusalem contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
