Pub. L. No. 100-86, 101 Stat.552. Section 402 of CEBA required the Board to establish an asset classificationscheme consistent with the classification practices of the Federal bankingagencies. In particular, section 407 of CEBA instructed the Board to removethe scheduled items system.Pursuant to this Congressional mandate, the Board proposed for public commenta rule amending the classification of assets system that, among other things,removed the scheduled items provision of the Board's regulations, 12 CFR561.15 (1987). 52 FR 39087 (October 20, 1987). After considering all commentsreceived, the Board adopted a final rule on December 21, 1987 that removedthe andSection; 561.15 scheduled items regulation, and established a classificationof assets system consistent with the asset classification practices ofthe Federal banking agencies. 53 FR 338 (January 6, 1988) (``final rule'').Under this final rule, assets that would have been deemed schedule itemsunder the old classification scheme became subject to the classificationsystem established by andSection; 561.16(c). <T3>See </T3>12 CFR 561.16(c) (1988); 53 FR 338, 341. In promulgating thefinal rule, the Board reiterated its desire that required capital levelsreflect asset quality and emphasized the final rule's consistency withthe Board's broader and more comprehensive attempts to revise and promulgatecapital-related regulations and generally raise the industry's capitallevels. 53 FR 338, 344. <T3>See also </T3>12 CFR 563.14(b)(7) (1988) (Higher levels of capitalmay be apprioriate under the individual minimum capital requirement foran insured institution ``with a portfolio reflecting weak credit qualityor a significant likelihood of financial loss, or that has loans in nonperformingstatus or on which borrowers fail to comply with payment terms.'')In addition to andSection; 561.15, eighteen regulations contain the term``scheduled items'' or refer to andSection; 561.15. These regulations werenot removed or revised by the final rule and continue to contain the term``scheduled items'' or refer to former andSection; 561.15. The Board proposedto remove references to scheduled items and to revise these provisionsto ensure they are consistent with both the new asset classification schemeand the Board's expressed belief that the overall capital strength of insuredinstitutions is an effective and reliable means of evaluating the healthof insured institutions and their affiliates.Before the adoption of the final rule, the Board used a measure of an insuredinstitution's ratio of schedule items to specified assets to determinewhether to approve such institution's application to engage in certainactivities. Since the Board removed the scheduled items system, the continueduse of a measure including scheduled items and ``specified assets'' isproblematic. The Board no longer uses an institution's ``specified assets''in determining whether a thrift may engage in certain activities. Therefore,the Board proposes to remove andSection; 561.17 and to revise those regulationsthat refer to a specifed assets ratio, consistent with CEBA and the finalrule.Accordingly, the Board proposes to amend existing regulations that requirea prescribed ratio of scheduled items to specified assets as a litmus testfor authority of insured institutions to engage in expanded activities.The Board proposes to replace that measurement with a requirement thatinsured institutions demonstrate compliance with the minimum capital requirementsof andSection; 563.13 and with the individual minimum capital requirementsof andSection;andSection; 563.14 and 563.14-1. The inclusion of compliancewith minimum capital requirements provides supervisory personnel with theflexibility to restrict an institution's activities on the basis of overallcapital strength, as determined on a case-by-case basis, rather than onthe scheduled items formula that only measured problem assets. The Board'sobjective to provide supervisory personnel with increased flexibility isconsistent with the stated goal of the final rule of ``fostering the exerciseof greater flexibility and discretion by examiners and supervisory personnelin classifying assets and in establishing valuation allowances.'' 53 FR338, 340. An exception to the proposal's removal of references to scheduled itemsis the use of that term (and the use of the term ``scheduled item factor'')contained in andSection; 563.13(b)(4)(i)(F). 12 CFR 563.13(b)(4)(i)(F) (1988).The scheduled item factor is used to calculate the contingency componentof an institution's regulatory capital requirement. <T3>Id.</T3> In the final rule, the Board adopted the use of the scheduleditem factor as an interim, transitional measure to lessen the harmful effectsthat would result from the deletion of scheduled items from the contingencycomponent. As discussed in the final rule, this deletion, coupled withother revisions to the asset classification regulation, would have significantlyaltered both the minimum regulatory capital requirements and the capitallevels of many insured institutions. 53 FR 338, 345. In light of the considerableamount of industry capital that institutions maintained due to scheduleditems, the Board decided in the final rule to require institutions to includea factor of their reported scheduled items as of September 30, 1987, incalculating their minimum regulatory capital requirement under andSection;563.13. The contingency component <T3>will continue </T3>to include the scheduled item factor as an interimdevice until the Board completes its review, analysis, and considerationof appropriate revisions of the minimum regulatory capital regulation.<T3>See</T3> 53 FR 338, 345. The Board is also proposing technical amendments to existing andSection;andSection;563.17-2 and 571.1a in an effort to ensure that this regulatory provisionand Statement of Policy are consistent with the asset classification systemoutlined in the final rule. These amendments merely reflect the Board'sconclusions, as stated in the final rule and the Supplementary Informationaccompanying the final rule, that a properly conducted appraisal may bean important factor in an examiner's evaluation of an asset, but that therisk of nonpayment is dependent upon several factors, as discussed in thisSupplementary Information. <T3>See</T3> 53 FR 349, 350 (January 6, 1988). These amendments clarifyexisting language, overlooked in the drafting of the final rule, that incorrectlysuggests that an appraisal is required in the evaluation of real estateor real estate collateral for the purpose of establishing valuation allowances.(Consistent with the final rule, andSection; 563.17-2(a) will continue torequire that an appraisal be conducted with respect to real estate ownedat the earlier of foreclosure or in-substance foreclosure.) These amendmentsto andSection; 563.17-2(b) provide that the availability of private mortgageinsurance compensation may be a re-evaluation factor rather than a classificationof assets factor as currently provided by andSection; 571.1a. Finally, the Board is also proposing a technical amendment to andSection;545.112 to ensure that this section is consistent with the asset classificationsystem outlined in the final rule. Specifically, this section's discussionof real estate owned (``REO'') and uncollected interest is being amendedto ensure that a Federal association carries REO at fair market value,which may include uncollected interest to the extent such interest is supportedby the fair market value of the property. As stated in the SupplementaryInformation accompanying the final rule, ``[t]he fair market value of theREO at the date of acquisition * * * becomes the carrying value of theproperty on the books of the institution, * * * [and] the institution orthe examiner must recognize additional losses if, subsequent to the dateof acquisition, the NRV is less than the fair market value at acquisition.''<T3>See</T3> 53 FR 338, 343. The Board solicits particular comment on thisamendment, including views addressing whether it may be more appropriatesimply to remove andSection; 545.112 entirely. <ITAG tagnum="84">Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis</ITAG>Pursuant to section 3 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 604,the Board is providing the following regulatory flexibility analysis: 1. <T3>Reasons, objectives, and legal basis underlying the proposed rule.</T3>These elements are incorporated above in the <T2>``SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION'' </T2>section. 2. <T3>Small entities to which the proposed rule would apply. </T3>The proposedrule would apply to all insured institutions without regard to size. 3. <T3>Impact of the proposed rule on small entities. </T3>The proposed rulewould not have a disproportionate impact on small insured institutions.4. <T3>Overlapping or conflicting federal rules. </T3>There are no known federalrules that duplicate, overlap, or conflict with this proposal. 5. <T3>Alternatives to the proposed rule. </T3>The Board has not found anyalternatives to date that would be less burdensome and adequately addressits concerns. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects </ITAG>12 CFR Part 545Accounting, Consumer protection, Credit, Electronic funds transfers, Investments,Manufactured homes, Mortgages, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements,Savings and loan associations. 12 CFR Parts 546 and 561 Savings and loan associations. 12 CFR Part 563 Bank deposit insurance, Currency, Investments, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements, Savings and loan associations. 12 CFR Part 563b Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Savings and loan associations,Securities. 12 CFR Part 563c Accounting, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Savings and loanassociations, Securities. 12 CFR Part 570 Bank deposit insurance, Savings and loan associations. 12 CFR Part 571 Accounting, Bank deposit insurance, Savings and loan associations.
