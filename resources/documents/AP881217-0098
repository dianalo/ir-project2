Sihanouk, who has met Hun Sen three times in France _ the firstin December 1987 and the latest last month _ called the primeminister ``a collaborator and a traitor,'' and the ``valet of theVietnamese'' who ``sells off his country to the foriegners.''   Hun Sen's communist government was installed by the Vietnameseafter they invaded Cambodia in 1978, ending the four-year reign ofterror by the Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge.   The five-point peace plan was outlined in July, when the leadersof the four Cambodian factions met in Jakarta, Indonesia. The fourthgroup is the non-communist Khmer People's National Liberation Frontled by former Prime Minister Son Sann.   The points of the plan are:   _A precise timetable for the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops fromCambodia. Hun Sen claims Vietnam has 50,000 troops in Cambodia, butWestern experts put the figure at more than 100,000.   _The dismantling of Hun Sen's regime   _General elections under the control of an internationalcommission   _Formation of a new government and army that would includesupporters of the four sides   _A U.N. peacekeeping force based in Cambodia.   Sihanouk said Saturday he would run for president when theelections are held.   The prince, speaking in French, said his meeting with Hun Senlast month was ``a total 500 percent failure.''   Sihanouk last week also met Khieu Samphan, the leader of theKhmer Rouge, in the village of Fere-en-Tardenois, northeast ofParis. After the meeting, Khieu Samphan told reporters his groupconsidered Sihanouk the ``national leader'' of Cambodia and heendorsed the five-point plan.   ``They are not sincere, but they're intelligent,'' Sihanouk saidSaturday of the Khmer Rouge. Although they were ``murderers,'' headded, they could not be ignored in planning Cambodia's future.   The communist Khmer Rouge killed hundreds of thousands ofCambodians when they ruled the country in 1975-78.   The 40,000-member Khmer Rouge is the strongest of the three rebelgroups, followed by Sihanouk's force, which the prince said Saturdayhas 20,000 soldiers and is growing.   If the Khmer Rouge is excluded from a new Cambodian government,Sihanouk added, they would become ``bandits, outlaws, terrorists,and every time we built a bridge they'd destroy it.''   He said any future agreement among the Cambodian factions mustinclude guarantees that human rights will be respected.   The Cambodian government insists it must have a guarantee thatoutside aid to the guerrilla forces, especially the Chinese-suppliedKhmer Rouge, must cease before the Vietnamese withdrawal.   Hun Sen also has said the elections should be held under thepresent government, while Sihanouk insists on the resignation of thegovernmnet before the vote. Hun Sen also told reporters Friday thathe opposes an international peacekeeping force.</TEXT></DOC>
