Bill Kovach, who left the top post at The New York Times'Washington bureau to take over the Journal and Constitution inDecember 1986, announced his resignation Friday.   Stunned staffers then gathered 119 signatures on a petitionurging Publisher Jay Smith to reconsider his acceptance of Kovach'sresignation.   And a full-page advertisement in today's combined editions of thepapers _ which are essentially one newspaper with differenteditorial pages _ was purchased and signed by 123 of the paper'sapproximately 400 staffers.   It said they were ``deeply saddened by the sudden resignation ofEditor Bill Kovach. We are disturbed that it was so readilyaccepted.''   According to a story in Friday's editions of The Atlanta Journal,Smith said, ``An irreconcilable difference in management stylessurfaced in a discussion Friday morning.''   Smith said that although he and Kovach were ``in accordphilosophically over the direction the newspapers have taken,'' themanagement difference caused him to accept the editor's resignation.   Kovach said his resignation brought to an end ``two years ofeffort to develop a set of shared values and mutual trust with thesenior managers of the company. ... It became clear this week thatno such relationship existed.''   Exactly what precipitated Friday morning's developments wasunclear. Neither the Journal's story nor Kovach's statement wentinto detail.   But according to today's edition of The New York Times, somestaffers suggested that the newspapers' management had been underpressure to rein in Kovach because of his aggressive business-newscoverage.   Kovach reportedly riled some of the city's most highly visiblecorporate citizens with articles that included descriptions ofdiscriminatory lending practices in Atlanta's poorest neighborhoods.   Spokesmen for concerns including The Citizens and SouthernNational Bank, Coca-Cola Co. and Georgia Power Co. told the Timesthat the companies had played no role in Kovach's departure.   Smith said only that the disagreement was ``fairly narrowlyfocused.'' He acknowledged that he and Kovach differed on severalissues, including control of the newspapers' Washington bureau andthe amount of money to be committed to covering news.   He said the budget dispute was settled several weeks ago, butSmith declined to comment on whether their dispute over control ofthe Washington bureau was related to Kovach's resignation.</TEXT></DOC>
