(HBC), based in Toronto, is one of Canada's oldest andlargest retailers, with 1989 sales and revenue of $4.59 billion and anoperating profit of $315 million from its retailing operations.andM;Like many other corporations in the 1960s and 1970s, Hudson's Bay embarked ona program of acquisition and diversification that took it outside the worldof retailing and into uncharted territory.andP;  This left the organizationill-prepared to effectively respond to the turfbulent economic climate of the1980s.andP;  In early 1985, after $250 million in earnings losses over three yearsand a continuing erosion of market share, the company announced a majorrestructuring of its operations.andM;Reorganization meant the company had to recommit itself to its core business-- retailing -- and sell off all unrelated operations.andP;  It also required theimplementation of a stringent program to reduce costs, improve competitivestanding and streamline operations across the board.andM;Hudson's Bay looked to its information services (IS) organization as a keyplayer.andP;  To align itself with the company's goals of aggressive innovationand doing more with less, IS had to transform itself into a profitablebusiness within a business -- and undertake a major overhaul to achieve thatgoal.andP;  The reorganization resulted in:andM;* staff reductions from 752 employees in 1984 to 496 in 1986;andM;* replacement of all senior IS managers by June 1985;andM;* consolidation of development groups and remote sites, reducing 11facilities to seven by 1986;andM;* slashing of operating expenses by $13.5 million over two years; and,andM;* reduction of IS expenses as a percentage of revenue from 1.8 per cent in1984 to 1.3 per cent in 1986.andM;When losses had begun to mount in 1984, Hudson Bay's IS examined itsprecarious situation: it had to cut costs quickly, contain capital spending,and increase productivity.andP;  But when IS looked to its existing managementsupport system for the information it needed for decision making, the systemcame up short.andP;  Its basic weaknesses included contradictory information, highprocessing costs and inability to access information on-line.andM;After a thorough analysis of commercially available alternatives forcorrecting these deficiencies, HBC acquired Vienna, Va.-based Legent Corp.'sMICS IS management support system in July 1984.andM;The system was originally used to evaluate computer performance.andP;  But sinceits initial installation, its role and importance have evolved dramatically.andO;Soon after the management support system was implemented, the performancegroup was eliminated in the corporate restructuring process.andP;  As attention toimprove business practices increased, a group implementing service-levelmanagement picked up responsibility for the system.andP;  With this change,capacity management and service-level reporting became high priorities.andM;The information available through the support system is the basis for IS'planing procedures, which allow it to forecast annual capacity usage with ahigh degree of accuracy.andP;  Now IS managers dial-in each morning to checkservice quality, a unique interactive function that provides service reportsfor each business system.andM;By using MICS, IS been able to lower depreciation expense and reduce debt.andO;For example, IS found that various departments used much of the same data fordecision making.andP;  In particular, the capacity planning and performancemeasurement staffs processed RMF/SMF data monthly; the later group alsoprocessed the same data weekly.andP;  And both staffs process CICS logging data.andO;The management support system eliminated multiple passes of this data,resulting in an annual processing cost savings of nearly $60,000.andM;With the help of information produced by the system, IS improved its internalimage among its customers by demonstrating improved information integrity,enhanced responsiveness and better service-level management.andM;In discussing the alternatives open to HBC had MICS not been available,Michael Nieder, director of computing and communication said, &quot;Theimpact...would be felt in two ways: first, the addition expense that would berequired to provide similar functions, and second, the increase in timerequired to get the necessary information across.andM;Robert Caravella is director of product management at Vienna, Va.-basedLegent Corp.'s IS management division.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
