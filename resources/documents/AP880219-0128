Ted Windt, professor and editor of two books on presidentialrhetoric, rated the candidates' speaking style in this campaign'searly grading period, giving Democratic hopeful Jesse Jackson thebest mark, A-minus, and former Colorado Sen. Gary Hart an F.   ``Regardless of whether people vote for him or not, they respectand respond to his speaking,'' Windt said of Jackson. ``I do thinkrhyming periodic sentences will grow thin after a while. He shouldbeef his theme up with some less soaring statements.''   Hart, meanwhile, fails in Windt's grade book.   ``He's had four years to answer the question, `Where's thebeef?' He's still unable to do it,'' the professor said. ``Althoughhe talks new ideas, he's talking about the past. In debates hecannot reply on the sensitive ... issue without attacking themedia.''   On the Republican side, Bush ``frequently sounds like he'swhining,'' according to Windt, who gave the vice president aC-minus. However, in New Hampshire, Bush changed his style whichenabled him to capture the primary.   ``In New Hampshire he began to speak rather than whine. Herecognizes he's going to have to fight for the nomination withDole, and has begun to mix it up,'' Windt said.   The rhetoric expert gave Bush's chief rival, Kansas Sen. BobDole, a B for the theme ``I'm one of you,'' which played so well inthe Iowa caucuses. The slogan, however, may prove short-sighted, hesaid.   Dole also ``has an incisive sense of humor that some think ismean,'' Windt said.   Former television evangelist Pat Robertson gets a B as ``anatural TV performer.''   ``He's attempting to soften the hard image of a self-righteousevangelical who's out to vanquish evil. In softening his image, hehas not yet developed a clear-cut image or person,'' Windt said.   New York Rep. Jack Kemp, although hard to grade, gets a C plusfor being ``lackluster in debates,'' Windt said.   Among the other Democrats, Simon gets a C for being``professorial, more a lecturer than a speaker,'' Windt said of theIllinois senator. ``He should remember that a campaign is not arequired course for students, but an elective that voters canchoose to attend or skip,'' he said.   Gore gets an incomplete for campaigning so little in Iowa andNew Hampshire, Windt said. ``He doesn't project any sense ofhumor'' and ``still looks like he's running for class president ofa very expensive, preppy school,'' Windt said.   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis gets a C for coming across asa ``technocrat and a manager without human warmth,'' said Windt.</TEXT></DOC>
