At CMUthe authors are developing some of these applications and the hardwareand software environments to support them, and in this paper they presenta new language, Durra, to write what we call task-level application descriptions.Although the language was developed with a concrete set of needs, theauthors aim at a broader class of applications and hardware implementations.After a brief description of the nature of these applications and a scenariofor the development process, they concentrate on the language and itsmain features.</TEXT></DOC>
