Thestagnation in the coal industry east of the Mississippi is alleged tohave been caused by this declining productivity and by the growth ofcheaper and cleaner coal production west of the Mississippi. Economicevidence suggests, however, that productivity declines were more dueto a relative lowering of labor costs in comparison with coal pricesand due to work stoppages. The development of western coal fields wasspurred by growth in local demand and had only a relatively small impacton coal production east of the Mississippi. Problems of the eastern coalindustry are rooted mainly in slow economic growth in eastern US whichmust be addressed in the long-term interests of the eastern coal industry.5 refs., 9 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
