Sitting on adesk in his bedroom, it opened a window on a world he foundso consuming that he quit high school and spent most days andnights at the keyboard.   His parents often wondered what their son found socompelling in the endless hours he spent alone in his room.</LP><TEXT>   Then one afternoon last summer, a dozen Secret Serviceagents burst into the family's suburban home. Agents heldEdward and   Lou Darden at gunpoint as they swarmed into their son'sroom, seizing scores of disks, armloads of files and threecomputers.   When Frank got home an hour later, the terrified young manconfessed that he had used his home computer to break into   BellSouth Corp.'s telephone network. In February, Mr.Darden and two others were indicted on felony charges ofconspiracy and wire fraud.   &quot;I guess now my parents know what I was doing in my room,&quot;says a remorseful Mr. Darden, a bright, impatient 24-year-oldwith shoulder-length hair and a tiedyed T-shirt.   Mr. Darden thus became another of the growing number of&quot;hackers&quot; nabbed by federal agents. For a long time, thesehigh-tech trespassers operated in relative obscurity, usingtheir computers and phone lines to go where few people weremeant to go. But lately, in a string of highly publicizedcases, hacking has moved toward the forefront of white-collarcrime. Increasingly, banks, businesses, credit bureaus andtelephone companies are discovering that someone, often inthe dead of night, has wandered into their computer systems-- and left his mark.   As Mr. Darden's experience reveals, hacking has developedits own subculture, rich with literature and legend andpeopled by electronic vandals, voyeurs and explorers known byfanciful code names. &quot;Any business that has a computer hookedto a phone is vulnerable,&quot; warns Mr. Darden, who calledhimself the &quot;The Leftist.&quot; Before the bust, he was one of thebest.   Mr. Darden's case is part of a broad federal crackdown on*  computer hackers that has led to more than 30 raids incities across the country. In the most recent sweep, 13people were arrested in New York last week, including a14-year-old suspected of breaking into a computer used by theSecretary of the Air Force.   An early target in the crackdown was the Legion of Doom,an elite clique of hackers that included Mr. Darden and wastargeted by the Secret Service because of its members'notable skills. &quot;The Legion of Doom had the power tojeopardize the entire phone network,&quot; says Kent B. Alexander,an assistant U.S. attorney prosecuting Mr. Darden's case inAtlanta.   In a Secret Service affidavit filed in U.S. District Courtin Atlanta, BellSouth investigators call the Legion of Doom&quot;a severe threat to U.S. financial and telecommunicationsindustries.&quot; Federal agents suspect the Legion wasresponsible for software &quot;time bombs&quot; -- destructive programsdesigned to shut down major switching hubs -- planted intelephone company computers in Denver, Atlanta and New Jerseylast year. The programs were defused before causing damage,investigators say, but the intrusions, which weren'tdisclosed by the phone companies, could have knocked outservice to hundreds of thousands of customer phone lines.   The government sweep so far has bagged a motley band,mostly loners and young rebels in their teens or earlytwenties. In past cases, many of the hackers who haveadmitted breaking into computers have insisted that theydidn't damage the systems they penetrated. They did it forsport.   &quot;There's no thrill quite the same as getting into yourfirst system,&quot; says Phrack, an electronic magazine run out ofa University of Missouri dorm and accessed by computer.Before it was shut down in the latest sweep, Phrack (forphone-freak hacking) published tips on cracking computersecurity. One issue offers a &quot;hacker's code of ethics,&quot; whichadvises, &quot;Do not intentionally damage any system&quot; or alterany files &quot;other than ones you need to ensure your escape.&quot;Another rule: &quot;Don't be afraid to be paranoid. Remember, youare breaking the law.&quot; Mr. Darden says he strictly adhered tothe code.   But the hackers' creed means nothing in court. There,hacking is treated much like any other form of criminaltrespass under a law Congress passed in 1988. The lawpersuaded many hackers to end their illicit forays. But itturned other hobbyists into criminals.   During his hacker days, Mr. Darden's world was an oddlysolitary one. For hours on end he sat in front of thecomputer screen, finding his only human contact in the words*  and arcane code that arrived via computer from otherhackers. &quot;Once he got into a subject, there was no stopping,&quot;recalls his mother. &quot;He was always studying up on something.He read encyclopedias as a pastime.&quot;   Geography was meaningless; friends from around the worldwere just a few keystrokes away, thanks to modems thatconnect computers through phone lines. Mr. Darden says he hasstruck up many lasting friendships on-line with people he hasnever met in person.   In this silent, cerebral world, age is also irrelevant.Only computer skills count. Once on-line, a hacker can beanyone he or she wants to be. &quot;No one knows if you're fat,pimply, or scared to talk to girls,&quot; says Sheldon Zenner, aChicago attorney who recently defended an editor of Phrack onfelony wire-fraud charges. &quot;Suddenly you're no longer justthe shy adolescent, but Knight Lightning or The Prophet.&quot;   &quot;It's a compulsion for some of these people,&quot; adds Mr.Alexander, the Atlanta prosecutor. &quot;I'm convinced that ifLotus 1-2-3 was behind Door No. 1, and Cheryl Tiegs wasstanding behind Door No. 2, a hacker would go for thesoftware.&quot;   Mr. Darden recounts his hacking days with disapproval --and just a touch of pride. He broke into his first system atthe age of 17, dialing his way into a big computer at HayesMicrocomputer Products Inc., in Norcross, Ga., and nosingaround the system. &quot;I didn't take anything, I was just tryingto see if it could be done,&quot; he says now. Hayes uncovered thebreach and quickly tightened security, he says.   Hacking sessions often stretched into the early morninghours. He would start by checking lists of computer phonenumbers collected by his computer the night before through anautomatic process called &quot;war dialing.&quot; That's the bruteforce approach to hacking, when the computer runs through thenight, methodically dialing every number in a telephoneexchange. It records the number whenever it hits a &quot;carriertone&quot; signaling a computer is on the other end.   In a typical night of war dialing, in which the computermight check thousands of numbers, perhaps 100 computercarrier tones would be unearthed, &quot;each one a potentialtreasure chest,&quot; Mr. Darden says. He would then begin callingdown the &quot;hit list&quot; with his computer, each time trying todetermine what kind of system was on the other end. Faxmachines were a problem, because they emit a tone that soundslike a computer, so he wrote software that ignored them.   Each kind of computer had a distinctive response to hiscall, so he would tailor his approach to the type of systemhe encountered. Computers that used the Unix softwareoperating system were especially easy to break into, whileDigital Equipment Corp.'s VAX computers, which have multiplelevels of security, presented a bigger challenge. But he sayshe was fond of the VAX because of its widely used software.&quot;For a hacker, the VAX is like putting on an old Jimi Hendrixrecord in a bar -- it's a real classic.&quot; Using purloinedtelephone credit-card numbers, which his computer generatedthrough trial and error, he got into computers all over theworld, including an encounter with a VAX that spoke Finnish.   He devised password-cracking programs that automated thehacking process. He also devised a program that let himcapture legitimate users' passwords as they logged onto thesystem. When he found a password the target computerrecognized, his screen would typically respond with a prompt,such as a sign. &quot;Once you get that, you've got an open door,&quot;he says. Often he would play &quot;cat-and-mouse games&quot; with acompany's computer operators. &quot;I'd send a little greeting totheir printer, to let them know I was there. It drove themcrazy.&quot;   Credit bureaus were a favorite target. And, despite thewarnings of other hackers that it might give him away, hisfirst move was to look up his own credit report. &quot;Naturally,I didn't have one,&quot; he says. He found his parents' report,and looked up others for friends.   To make the process more efficient, and show off, Mr.Darden and other hackers traded phone numbers andsystem-cracking tips on pirate &quot;bulletin boards&quot; -- computersystems that store and forward text and electronic mail overphone lines. &quot;Black Ice&quot; was one such board. Access wastightly limited to an elite circle.   Mr. Darden's biggest thrill as a hacker -- and ultimatelyhis downfall -- came when he broke into a big BellSouthcomputer in Atlanta used by technicians to maintain andcontrol the phone system. He learned how to navigate withinthe system by asking questions of BellSouth's own online&quot;help&quot; program. Once inside, he found he had the ability toreroute telephone calls or bring down switching centers,neither of which he says he did. Mr. Darden did, however,listen in on a few phone lines, but only those of otherhackers, he insists, and only to prove his prowess.   &quot;If we'd wanted to, we could have knocked out serviceacross the Southeastern U.S.,&quot; he says. &quot;The fact that Icould get into the system amazed me. But we were careful notto damage anything.&quot;   Not surprisingly, when BellSouth discovered hackers wererummaging through its computer, it reacted swiftly. It put 42investigators on the task of tracking the intruders down, andspent $1.5 million on the effort. Once it found the source ofthe intrusions, it called in the Secret Service, whichenforces computer-crime laws.   In the indictment, Mr. Darden and two co-defendants,Robert J. Riggs, 21, a.k.a. The Prophet, and Adam E. Grant,22, a.k.a. The Urvile, were charged with taking copies ofproprietary software from BellSouth during their ramblings inthe system, and with unauthorized intrusion, possessingillegal phone credit-card numbers with intent to defraud, andconspiracy. Messrs. Darden and Riggs pleaded guilty toconspiracy and face a maximum of five years in prison and a$250,000 fine. Mr. Grant pleaded guilty to possessingBellSouth computer access codes with the intent to defraudand faces a maximum of 10 years in prison and a $250,000fine. Sentencing is scheduled for Sept. 14. The only goodthing to come out of the whole experience,   Mr. Darden muses, is that after he was indicted, hishigh-school sweetheart -- whom he often spurned in favor ofhis computer -- saw his picture on the front page of thelocal paper and got back in touch. Mr. Darden, who now worksinstalling systems for a local computer company, viewshimself as a purist, hacking for the thrill of exploring theforbidden. He looks down on those who use their skills simplyto steal phone and credit-card numbers. But in this game,information is everything, and not even Mr. Darden cancontrol its spread. During their sweep, federal agents havefound some hackers using code-cracking information dug up bythe Legion of Doom to perpetrate their own practical jokesand fraud.   For a few days last year, for example, phone calls to theDelray Beach, Fla., probation office were mysteriouslyrerouted to a dial-a-porn line in New York. Secret Serviceagents say it's the kind of thing the Legion might have done.   And in Elwood, Ind., a 15-year-old calling himself Fry Guyallegedly used information he got from the Legion to carryout an elaborate fraud. Secret Service agents say he used hiscomputer to break into a credit rating service in Maryland topilfer VISA and MasterCard credit information. He thenentered BellSouth's control network and altered a pay phoneon a street corner in nearby Paducah, Ky., to residentialstatus. Next, he called Western Union and had cash wired outof credit-card accounts to the Paducah Western Union office.When Western Union called the credit-card holders to verifythe transactions, the calls were forwarded to the pay phoneand then to the youth's home phone, where he posed as thecredit-card holders and gave approval. The cash was thenpicked up at the Western Union window, investigators say.   In all, Fry Guy siphoned more than $10,000 in cash andpurchases from credit-card accounts, alleges William M.Gleason, the Secret Service investigator. He also foundevidence that Fry Guy, whose name hasn't been released,hacked his way into a payroll computer for a local McDonald'sCorp. outlet, giving pay raises to his friends working at therestaurant.   Fry Guy's case is being handled by state juvenileauthorities and, because of his age, it is unclear whatpunishment he might get. At the very least, his parents arelikely to watch the family phone bill more closely. In arecent meeting with federal prosecutors, Fry Guy'sexasperated father wore a baseball cap bearing the legend&quot;Kids: They'll drive you crazy.&quot;   Federal agents admit that, when they detect an intruderinside a computer, there isn't any way of telling if it's aprecocious teen-ager or a crook out to commit fraud. So theysimply execute the law.   &quot;When a hacker gets into a system, it's no different froma burglar breaking into your home or office,&quot; says SecretService agent James Cool. If the door is open, the law treatsa trespasser differently, he adds. But if a hacker cracks apassword to get into a system, &quot;it's the same as kicking in alocked door -- and we're going to come after them.&quot;   Ed Darden wishes he had known all of this before he gavehis son that Apple II for Christmas eight years ago. &quot;I'dhave thought twice about it,&quot; he says. &quot;Maybe we should havegiven him a bicycle.&quot;   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          AN ARTICLE on computer hackers on Aug. 22 mentionedcomputer bulletin boards, including one called Black Ice. Theone referred to, which federal law enforcement officials sayhad been operating in Richmond, Va., isn't connected with acomputer bulletin board system in Austin, Texas, that also isnamed Black Ice.
