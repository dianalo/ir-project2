By takinginto account the effects of variations in molecular cloud parameterson conversion factors between integrated CO intensity and molecular hydrogencolumn density, it is shown that conversion factors are very sensitiveto the kinetic temperature of the emitting gas. Results indicate thatthe gas temperatures in systems with high star formation rates can bequite high, and it is suggested that use of a standard conversion factorwill lead to systematic overestimation of the amount of molecular gas.69 references.</TEXT></DOC>
