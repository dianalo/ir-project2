The move is further evidence that Lotus and Novell intendto compete aggressively against Microsoft Inc., generallyviewed as the most influential software supplier in thecomputer industry.</LP><TEXT>   Jim Manzi, Lotus chief executive officer, said the jointservice operation makes sense because each of the three firmsshare many customers. &quot;Wouldn't it be wonderful if a customergets to call one place and gets an answer to their question,&quot;Mr. Manzi said.   Lotus already exchanges technology with WordPerfect, butMr. Manzi said WordPerfect isn't interested in merging withLotus and Novell.   Nevertheless, Lotus and Novell say cooperating withWordPerfect will benefit them. The trio of companies &quot;are nowin a position where they can help guide the {personalcomputer} industry,&quot; said Raymond Noorda, Novell chiefexecutive.   Mr. Manzi predicted that the deal between Lotus andNovell, which would give the combined company greater revenuethan that at Microsoft, should be completed in 90 days. Hesaid he expects shareholders of both companies to vote on theproposed deal in early July.   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          LOTUS DEVELOPMENT Corp., Novell Inc. and WordPerfect Inc.will assist one another in answering questions fromcustomers, but the service operations of each softwarecompany will remain independent.
