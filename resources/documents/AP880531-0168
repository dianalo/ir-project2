The head of the largest U.S. Indian organization called theremarks insulting.   ``Maybe we made a mistake'' in trying to maintain Indiancultures, Reagan said in answering questions at Moscow StateUniversity. ``Maybe we should not have humored them in that,wanting to stay in that kind of primitive lifestyle. Maybe weshould have said, `No, come join us. Be citizens along with therest of us.'''   Reagan misspoke. Indians are citizens. All American Indians weremade full citizens by an act of Congress in 1924. It wasn't until1948 when court decisions gave them full voting rights in Arizonaand New Mexico in local and state elections.   The 1980 census recorded 1.37 million Indians, of whom 332,000were living on 260 reservations.   In Washington, Suzan Shown Harjo, a Cheyenne and Creek who isexecutive director of the National Congress of American Indians,said, ``I was appalled by the president's performance but notsurprised. ... He has headed the worst administration for Indianssince the days of outright warfare and extermination ....   ``I found particularly insulting his statement that perhaps theUnited States should not have `humored them,' meaning us,'' shesaid.   Ms. Harjo's organization counts 3,500 individual members andtribes containing 850,000 members.   Responding to a student's question, Reagan said he would be``very happy'' to meet with three Indians who went to Moscow duringthe president's summit meeting with Kremlin leader Mikhail S.Gorbachev.   They went under the sponsorship of the militant American IndianMovement to call attention to their grievances, among them hungerand lack of housing among Indians. The president has never met withIndian groups.   Reagan told the Soviets that American Indians ``from thebeginning, announced that they wanted to maintain their way oflife, as they had always lived there in the desert and the plainsand so forth. And we set up these reservations so they could, andhave a Bureau of Indian Affairs to help take care of them.''   The president's remarks reflected decades-old oscillation inU.S. policy toward native Americans. The federal government hasflip-flopped on whether Indians should be encouraged to maintaintheir culture or abandon it and join the mainstream.   Current policy is to maintain Indian cultures, treating thetribes as sovereign governments in their own right.   From 1887 to 1934, official policy was to try to turn Indiansinto self-sufficient farmers. Although Franklin Roosevelt'sadministration reversed the policy and originated the``government-to-government'' idea, the Eisenhower administrationcalled for ``termination'' of tribes leading to assimilation ofIndians in the larger culture. Sixty tribes were dissolved, thoughabout half of those have been revived.   Presidents Kennedy and Johnson reverted to agovernment-to-government policy, and President Reagan hasreaffirmed it.   By any standard, Indians are among the poorest of the poor, butoff-reservation Indians appear to do better than those onreservations.   The 1980 census found 12 percent of the nation's populationliving in poverty, but among Indians poverty was found in 22percent of those living off reservations and 41 percent of those onreservations.   Just this month, the Bureau of Indian Affairs released a reportdocumenting performance on standard tests by pupils in the schoolsit runs. They do worse than 79 percent of the nation's pupilsoverall.   Reagan told his Moscow audience some Indians ``became verywealthy because some of those reservations were overlaying greatpools of oil. And you can get very rich pumping oil.''   Although some tribes distribute royalty revenue to members,others use the funds as tribal revenues.   Tribal oil royalties soared with oil prices, rising from $18million in 1973 to $147 million in 1982, but fell back to $81million last year as prices receded.   These figures do not include the Osage Tribe in Oklahoma, whichmanages its own lands and collects its own royalties _ by far thelargest of any tribe. The 4,749-member tribe got $71 million, about$15,000 per tribal member, in 1981, when oil prices were peaking.   Gregory Frazier, president of the Denver-based National UrbanIndian Council, said, ``There are a few (Indians) who have donefairly well, but there are probably fewer than 100 Indians youcould point to and say, `They've got some wealth.' But that's notoil; that's their own hard work.''   Frazier, a Crow, said he got a check for $38 for oil royaltieslast year.   Frazier's group tries to make sure Indians living off thereservation aren't forgotten or written out of federal legislation,and tries to help those Indians use state and local welfareagencies. There are practically no federal programs devoted tooff-reservation Indians.   Indians leave the reservation because of ``education, jobs andpolitics,'' Frazier said. ``Life can be very hard on a reservationif you're part of the `Out' party.''   ``I'm a fan of the president, but the president is a little bitremoved from the reality of American Indians,'' Frazier said.</TEXT></DOC>
