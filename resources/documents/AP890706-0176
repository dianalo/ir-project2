U.S. District Judge G. Ernest Tidwell, ruling Wednesday on Lowe'smotion to dismiss the lawsuit, said Lena Arlene Wilson can sue underGeorgia's law forbidding the seduction of a daughter if she allegesthat Lowe and her daughter, Jan Parsons, had unlawful sexualintercourse.   ``We will have a witness to that,'' Ms. Wilson's attorney, J. HueHenry, said after the ruling was made public Thursday.   Henry said he will file an amended lawsuit to that effect Friday,and ``we'll get ready for trial.''   The lawsuit stems from a videotape which Lowe purportedly made inhis hotel suite while visiting Atlanta last summer for theDemocratic National Convention. That videotape _ widely circulatedon Atlanta's party circuit and shown electronically censored on TVnews _ shows a man who looks like Lowe in a hotel room with the girland another woman.   It shows him seeming to stage-manage a sexual encounter betweenthe two, but does not show him having sex with Ms. Parsons. Henrysays, however, that he has witnesses who will testify that Lowe didhave sex with the girl.   Ms. Wilson sued under the daughter-seduction law, and alsoaccused Lowe of intentionally committing acts that caused emotionaldistress to the family.   ``This is a case of wanton, willful, intentional misconduct,''Henry told the judge last week.   In his ruling, Tidwell dismissed the emotional distress claim,saying the suit ``does not allege sufficient facts'' under Georgialaw to press the claim that Lowe intentionally inflicted emotionaldistress on Ms. Wilson.   Tidwell, however, rejected Lowe's motion to dismiss the claim fordamages on the basis of seduction. The judge noted that underGeorgia law, such a claim requires proof that unlawful sexualintercourse took place. He gave Ms. Wilson 10 days from Wednesday toamend her lawsuit to that effect.   Lowe attorney Richard North told reporters the ruling was ``veryfavorable,'' in that it ``narrowed the allegations against Mr. Loweby 50 percent.''   Ms. Wilson filed her lawsuit in May in State Court in FultonCounty, contending that Lowe enticed her daughter, then 16, intohaving sex with another woman while he videotaped them. Attorneysfor Lowe succeeded last month in transferring the case to federalcourt.   Edgar Neely III, an Atlanta attorney representing Lowe, arguedlast week that the lawsuit should be dismissed because in Georgiaonly a custodial parent has the right to take legal action onmatters concerning a child. Miss Parsons' father, John Parsons, hascustody and has waived his right to act in the case, Neely said.   However, Tidwell noted in his ruling that, according to Ms.Wilson's lawsuit, her daughter was living with her at the time ofthe alleged incident.   Lowe, 25, is the star of such films as ``St. Elmo's Fire'' and``About Last Night.''   A criminal investigation into possible charges against Lowe isofficially continuing, although no charges have been brought.</TEXT></DOC>
