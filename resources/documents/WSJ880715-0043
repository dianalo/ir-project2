Now the labels abound. There's Fuji Photo Film Co., with its green box and Konica Corp. in blue. Others eager to gain a footing in the lucrative and growing film market, where profit margins can reach 50% include Minnesota Mining andamp; Manufacturing Co.'s Scotch brand and Agfa-Gevaert AG of West Germany. There are also dozens of private-label varieties, including some Indian, English and Korean brands.    The latest to enter the fray: Polaroid Corp., which this week announced plans to sell conventional film. Although Polaroid hasn't disclosed its marketing strategy, the Boston-based company test-marketed a royal blue box called Polacolor in Spain and Portugal.    The increased number of choices is clearly good news for consumers, who can expect more promotions and rebate programs, but could be bad news for market leaders Kodak and Fuji, although Fuji is among those that might make the Polaroid film. Kodak still controls 80% of the U.S. market, and 60% of the $7 billion-a-year market world-wide. Fuji, which gained a foothold in the U.S. following its sponsorship of the 1984 Olympics, has 8% to 10% of the U.S. market and 20% to 25% worldwide.    But now both companies must fight hard to maintain their market share and will undoubtedly spend more on advertising and promotions. &quot;There's going to be so much mass advertising geared to film that photography will be on everybody's minds,&quot; says Edward Fox, director of market research at Photo Marketing Association International. Adds Alta Cools, editor of For Your Information, a photo industry newsletter: &quot;Polaroid's move into the film market is like waving a red flag at Kodak. They're going to pull out every stop to counteract them.&quot;    Polaroid's move may be especially galling to Kodak in light of Polaroid's successful patent infringement suit two years ago. The suit forced Kodak to leave the instant camera business, and now Polaroid is seeking $5.7 billion in damages.    A Kodak spokesman said the company intends to vigorously defend its market share in film -- its premier profit-making product.    No one expects Polaroid, Konica or any of the other lesser known brands to make huge dents in Kodak's market. The Rochester, N.Y.-based photography giant has an elaborate and efficient distribution system throughout the U.S. and abroad that is far superior to competitors. &quot;Every retailer is still going to stock Kodak,&quot; and select from among the other brands, contends Eugene Glazer, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.    Yet Kodak can no longer claim a monopoly on quality. Companies have caught up with the specialized technology that Kodak pioneered and virtually controlled through the 1970s. &quot;The average consumer is going to get pretty good prints from every brand,&quot; says Peter Liebmann, director of purchasing for Wolf Camera Inc., an 85-chain store based in Atlanta. Indeed, the differences more often come from photofinishers than from the film itself.    Kodak's new rivals are trying to make inroads with discount prices and special rebate programs. Both 3M's Scotch and Konica films typically sell at a 20% discount from Kodak film. (Fuji traditionally sells for a 10% discount.) Agfa provides K mart stores with film that offer three free exposures, creating a 27-picture roll, instead of the typical 24-exposure roll.    So far Kodak hasn't responded to the price discounts, but it has followed competitors in offering economy multipaks and rebates for film and photofinishing.    Many of the lesser-known companies, such as Konica, Agfa and 3M, gained a toehold in the U.S. market by first supplying private-label film to retailers and mass merchandisers, something which Kodak is reluctant to do. Now they are coming out with their own labels. 3M, for example, has been making private-label film for 30 years but in 1986, having improved its technology, launched film with its well-known Scotch name.    Konica, which began marketing its own brand film a little more than three years ago, had a natural market through its Photomat unit. Moreover, the company has tried to find a niche as an alternative supplier to small and mid-sized chains. It's also begun promoting more heavily by sponsoring athletic teams, including the U.S. rhythmic gymnastics Olympic team and, like Fuji and Kodak, flying a blimp in Japan.    Polaroid is counting on its name and existing distribution system to gain a market share. However, because Polaroid isn't now manufacturing the film, it won't enjoy the high profit margins of competitors and isn't expected to try to compete on price points. (Polaroid hasn't said who will make its film, but industry people point to either Agfa, which made Polaroid's test-market film, or Fuji, which already makes a slide film for Polaroid.)    The biggest winners in the film market may be the retailers who are being wooed by manufacturers anxious to gain shelf space. &quot;They have to convince me why their product is going to increase my film sales,&quot; says Wolf's Mr. Liebmann, who currently stocks Kodak, Fuji and Wolf's own private label made by 3M. </TEXT></DOC>
