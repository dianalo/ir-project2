The buyer is Houston-based Minatome Corp., a unit of Total Compagnie Francaise des Petroles, a Paris-based oil, gas and minerals concern. The purchase price is subject to adjustments based on oil and gas operations until the closing date.    The company had been seeking a buyer for the properties, located primarily in Texas and Louisiana, since last November in an effort to pay off some of its $300 million in debt. The properties contain about 13 million barrels of proven oil reserves and 65 billion cubic feet of proven natural gas reserves, which the company said represent a &quot;very substantial portion&quot; of its total proven reserves.    After completion of the sale, expected next month, the company's main asset will be its $150 million project with Du Pont Co.'s Conoco unit to explore and develop the 500,000-acre Khalda concession in Egypt's western desert. Conoco is the operator, and Texas International and Egyptian General Petroleum Corp. jointly own the working interests in the wells.    The company also has other international properties, including holdings in Canada, and said it will retain only a &quot;limited amount&quot; of producing domestic properties.    Texas International said proceeds from the sale will allow it to retire about $100 million in debt, representing all its U.S. bank debt and senior debt.    Texas International shares closed yesterday at $2.688, up 43.7 cents, in Pacific Stock Exchange trading.    The purchase would be the second major acquisition of U.S. domestic oil and gas reserves by Total CFP's Minatome unit in recent months. In December, Minatome bought the oil and gas exploration and production assets of Lear Petroleum Corp.'s Lear Petroleum Partners L.P. unit and other subsidiaries for about $115 million. </TEXT></DOC>
