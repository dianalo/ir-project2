One faction of the oil-producing group is pushing for a cut inproduction. A Western-oriented camp is bracing to block the move.   Venezuela, Libya, and Algeria want a production cut to keep oilprices at $18 a barrel. But a Saudi Arabia-led group has opposedthe idea, which failed to gain the support of oil ministers at thisweek's Arab Summit in Algiers, Algeria.   Twelve of the 28-year-old cartel's members agreed in December toextend a quota of 15 million barrels a day until June 30. Iraq,which is at war with Iran, refused to sign the accord because itdemanded a production quota equal to Tehran's.   Now, the members of the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries are so divided over production controls that manyanalysts expect them to fight over the issue for at least a week _and then give up. They were expected simply to extend the existingquota until the end of the year.   Harry Neustein, a New York-based oil trader who was to observethe meeting, says the disagreement will cause oil prices to fall.   ``It's going south, which of course, is great for theconsumer,'' Neustein said.   Some analysts said the lack of a new accord could force pricesdown by as much as $2 a barrel below the organization's target of$18.   The oil markets also showed little confidence in the ministers'ability to reach a consensus. The July contract price of West TexasIntermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude oil, fell 34 cents to $16.73a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange on Friday. That wasits lowest level in more than two months.   In addition, the cartel nations are doing little to help boostthe price. Currently, they are producing an estimated 18.5 millionbarrels a day, 3.4 million barrels a day more than their agreementallows.   The majority camp, led by Venezuela, wants to cut production topush oil prices up nearer OPEC's target price. Venezuela ideallywould like to cut production jointly with the interested producersoutside the cartel.   The non-OPEC members involved in the dialogue with OPEC areAngola, China, Colombia, Egypt, Mexico, Oman and Malaysia. Norwayis attending the meeting as observer, while Britain is notrepresented.   Venezuela aggressively backed an unsuccessful attempt bynon-OPEC producers in late April to get the cartel to agree to cutproduction.   A minority of four OPEC nations, led by heavyweight Saudi Arabia_ OPEC's largest producer _ blocked that attempt at theextraordinary OPEC meeting six weeks ago at which no new agreementwas reached. At the mid-year meeting, the minority opponents of theplan, again led by Saudi Arabia, want to boost production to matchpredictions of an increase in demand in the last six months of1988, analysts said.   However, the cartel's members don't even agree on how largedemand will be.   Estimates range from 17.6 million barrels a day to 18.9 millionbarrels a day.   In the first half of the year, demand was 17.7 million barrels aday, analysts say.</TEXT></DOC>
