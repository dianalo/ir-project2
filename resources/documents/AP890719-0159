Bork's testimony was no surprise to members of the panel but theremarks of former Solicitor General Charles Fried caught them offguard.   Fried had been expected to say that a new statute protecting theflag was possible, but he told the subcommittee he now agrees withBork that only a constitutional amendment would do the job _ and heopposes both an amendment and a statute.   The subcommittee began hearings last week on how to address lastmonth's ruling, which was quickly seized upon for denunciation bypoliticians of both parties.   President Bush is pushing a constitutional amendment while manyDemocratic leaders, saying they fear harm to the Bill of Rights,favor a carefully crafted statute to address the court's concerns.   Bork, a former federal judge now at a Washington think tank, saidhe saw little threat to constitutional freedoms.   ``Putting out of bounds a few means of expression in no waythreatens the American system of free speech,'' he said.   Bork said if his nomination by President Reagan in 1987 had beenapproved the ruling would have gone the other way. Justice AnthonyM. Kennedy, whose nomination was approved after Bork was rejected bythe Senate, voted with the court majority in the case.   Now, he argued, Congress should move swiftly to approve theconstitutional amendment, which would give Congress and the statesauthority to prohibit physical desecration of the flag.   The court would recognize a statute as ``intellectuallydishonest'' if it tried to ban flag burning and pretend that was notan attempt to stifle expression, he said, adding, ``After severalyears of litigation, we certainly would be right back where we aretoday.''   Fried was the Reagan administration's chief advocate before thenation's highest court, and in that role he declined to enter theflag-burning case.   He has said he might have sought to enter the case if the statutein question had been worded differently, and he had been expected totell the committee that a new statute could work. But he changed hismind.   Fried instead agreed with Bork and the Justice Department that aconstitutional amendment is the only way to overrule the court inthis case. The arguments against a statute were ``devastating,'' hesaid.   ``Whatever the technicalities, the evident purpose of such astatute would still be to punish acts of expression,'' he said.   However, Fried said he was dead against trying to overturn thecourt.   Fried recalled how he fled Czechoslovakia as a youngster andbecame an American citizen, and told the panel that tolerance ofacts like flag-burning was what made America special.   ``America, its traditions and values and its flag are important.But foremost among those values is the principle that no one shallbe punished for his political expressions _ no matter how offensiveor bizarre,'' he said.   ``That commitment to liberty is our first and greatestcontribution to the history of mankind,'' he said.   ``I hope and urge and pray that we will not act, that no statutebe passed and of course that the Constitution not be amended. Inshort, I believe the Johnson case is right not just as a matter ofpresent constitutional law, it is right in principle,'' he said.   Democrats, whose strategy is to produce a statute in order tocool the fervor for an amendment, told Fried it was too late to hopefor no action.   Hope that Congress would let the court ruling stand was dashedwhen President Bush traveled to the Iwo Jima memorial to announcehis support for the amendment, said the subcommittee chairman, Rep.Don Edwards, D-Calif. ``The issue was taken away from us by thepresident of the United States,'' he said.   But Fried said that ``the games that are being played are sotransparent the court is going to see right through them.''   He told the lawmakers, ``There are times when you can earn yourrather inadequate salaries by just doing the right thing ... It'scalled leadership.''</TEXT></DOC>
