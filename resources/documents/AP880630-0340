(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Payless Cashways Inc.'s board ofdirectors on Thursday approved a $909 million offer from seniormanagement to take the building supplies company private in aleveraged buyout.   Management will pay $27 a share in cash for the company's 33.66million outstanding shares, higher than the $26-a-share offer thegroup unveiled last week.   Payless spokeswoman Maureen Burgess said the higher offerresulted from ``negotiations between the special board commitee andthe management group'' and included the settlement of ``certainlitigation.''   The buyout was an apparent effort to discourage unwantedattention from New York investor Asher B. Edelman, who had built astake in the company and indicated he might be interested in makinga formal takeover offer.   Edelman partner Corey Horowitz said his group is monitoring thesituation carefully and awaiting details of the management offerbefore deciding ``what the best course of action is.'' He did notrule out making a takeover bid.   In trading Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange, Payless rose$1 a share to close at $26.50.   A special committee of independent directors and the Paylessboard approved the offer at a meeting at the company's headquartersin Kansas City.   ``We believe our proposal to acquire Payless Cashways serves thebest interest of all the company's constituents,'' said PaylessChairman David Stanley in a statement.   ``The company's shareholders will receive full and fair valuefor their investment, and for employees and customers, Payless willcontinue as a strong, independent leader in the building materialsretail industry,'' he added.   The acquisition will be made through a tender offer that willbegin ``as soon as practicable,'' the company said in a statement.In a leveraged buyout, investors borrow heavily to buy a companyand then pay off the debt with the target company's cash flow orthe sale of its assets.   Payless said the transaction will involve ``a substantial numberof employees, including all store managers, as equityparticipants.'' Over the next three years, more than 300 employeeswill receive stock options representing up to 15 percent of thecompany's common equity.   ``The key people to Payless' performance will now have a largeequity stake in the company's future,'' Stanley said.   He added that Payless does not plan to ``sell off parts of thecompany.'' He noted that a handful of the company's 200 retailoutlets that does not meet minimum profitability levels might beclosed, but that is exclusive of the buyout plan.   Payless is a building materials specialty retailer that servicesthe home improvement, maintenance and repair market. The company'sstores are located in 26 states in the Midwest, Southwest, PacificCoast and New England areas.   Edelman and his partners, who once held a 9.9 percent stake inPayless, now control about 8.1 percent of the company's shares. Thegroup complained earlier this week that it was denied access toimportant financial information about Payless that could have beenused to formulate an offer.   In addition to Edelman, the investor group also includes Paylesscompetitor Sutherland Lumber Southwest Inc., a privately ownedcompany that operates about 86 building materials stores in Midwestand Southern states.   Payless has been the subject of takeover talk for about threemonths.   The management group takeover is led by Stanley; Larry Kunz,president of Payless Cashways; Melvin and Harold Cohen, co-chairmenof Somerville Lumber, a Payless subsidiary; and Payless Cashway'sfive senior vice presidents.   At the time of the company's last proxy statement on Feb. 25,the group headed by Stanley owned less than 2 percent of thecompany's stock.   Earlier this week two Payless shareholders filed suit againstthe company and its directors challenging the initial $26-a-shareoffer, which the shareholders called a ``fraudulently low andunfair price.'' As part of the final deal, the suit has beensettled.   Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerceare leading the financing effort, providing a $600 million loan. Anumber of other financial institutions are participating.</TEXT></DOC>
