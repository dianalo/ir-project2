She suspected someone in her employment-services firm wasleaking confidential bidding information to a competitor.Would he plant a listening device in the suspect's phone? Andif not, would he tell her how to do it herself?</LP><TEXT>   Richard Aznaran, president of Dallas-based PhoenixInvestigations, who took the call, says he refused bothrequests, recommending that the manager consult an attorneyinstead. &quot;Criminal charges could have been brought forviolation of federal wiretapping laws, not to mentionpossible civil charges,&quot; he says.   Panic and outrage may be a natural reaction for anexecutive confronted with evidence that employees are leakinginternal information -- whether to the press, to a businessrival or to a government agency. But information-securityspecialists warn that overzealous managers can wind upcausing the company more damage than the leakers themselves.The best defense, they say, is a comprehensive programdesigned to minimize unauthorized release of proprietary data-- but not at the expense of employees' civil liberties.   &quot;Bosses get paranoid -- they want to do everything,illegal or not&quot; to stop a security breach, says HerbertClough, executive vice president at Paul ChamberlainInternational, a Beverly Hills, Calif., security andinvestigating concern. &quot;I tell them, you're a litigationlooking for a place to happen.&quot;   Still, in today's business climate, a little paranoiamight not be a bad thing. As more and more foreignintelligence services turn from stealing state secrets tostealing private corporate information, often with the helpof employees, U.S. companies are rightly beefing up security.And increasingly sophisticated electronic monitoring devicesmean unscrupulous competitors can listen in on a company'smost sensitive planning sessions.   The goal in fighting such efforts, says Lawrence T.Curran, general counsel of Boston's First Security Services,is to &quot;keep the guy with the white hat still riding the whitehorse at the end of it all.&quot;   For example, he says, few would argue with purelydefensive measures, such as &quot;sweeping&quot; an installation forsuspected bugs. But he occasionally has to convinceexecutives that they don't generally have a legal right tobug their own employeesand even if they did, they wouldlikely risk a lawsuit.   Ironically, say experts, most leaks can be traced tobenign sources. &quot;Probably 50% to 75% of the information beinglost got out through inadvertant disclosure,&quot; says RichardHeffernan, an information-security specialist in Branford,Conn. He advises companies to devise education programswarning employees not to talk about sensitive matters inpublic.   Another inadvertant source of leaks is waste paper. JohnKula, director of security for Arthur Andersen andamp; Co. inChicago, says he was recently hired by a majorbathroom-fixtures company that wanted to find out why acompetitor always seemed to come up with prices just a fewpennies under its own in sealed bids.   Mr. Kula deduced that the problem was the client's papershredder: It sliced documents into quarter-inch strips thatwere easy to put back together. What's worse, the client usedthe strips as packing material. &quot;They were sending out themost sensitive documents they as a company owned with theirproduct,&quot; he says, noting that the company got a newshredder.   In Fremont, Calif., security consultant Dennis Daltonrecalls a recent case in which a big company was convinced anoutsider was tapping into its electronic-mail system. Thereason: A message from an outside executive recruiter hadfound its way into that system.   The company's attack plan was formidable. It was going toconfront the recruiter's boss with the evidence, fire theperson in charge of electronic mail and contact a prosecutorabout initiating a criminal investigation, Mr. Dalton says.   But Mr. Dalton's investigation showed that somebody insidethe company had simply picked up the recruiter's message froma public electronic &quot;bulletin board&quot; and rebroadcast itthrough the system. &quot;More often than not, there's atremendous amount of emotionalism&quot; involved in a perceivedleak, Mr. Dalton says.   Many surveillance activities -- such as going through anemployee's garbage -- are legal in most jurisdictions. Butsecurity experts say such methods are usually ineffective.Speaking of dumpster diving, Floyd Purvis, a former securitychief for Texas Instruments Inc., says: &quot;I've only employedit two or three times in 20 or 30 years. No good results camefrom it.&quot;   The alternative -- an aggressive search for a company mole-- can turn into a public-relations disaster. AlyeskaPipeline Service Co., the Alaska oil-company consortium, isscrambling to contain the damage caused by a surveillanceoperation it commissioned into the activities of Charles B.Hamel, a prominent oil-industry critic who has been helping acongressional panel investigate the industry's environmentalimpact in Alaska.   Alyeska President James Hermiller has acknowledged theconsortium hired Wackenhut Corp. of Coral Gables, Fla., lastyear &quot;to plug some serious leaks&quot; of internal companydocuments that wound up in Mr. Hamel's hands. Mr. Hermillerdenied trying to inhibit a House committee's environmentalprobe. Wackenhut, while conceding it placed Mr. Hamel undersurveillance, has denied breaking any laws.   But details of the surveillance aren't helping Big Oil'simage. Among other things, according to affidavits andstatements taken from former Wackenhut employees, securityoperatives rifled through Mr. Hamel's garbage andelectronically monitored his home and business.   Earlier this month, Procter andamp; Gamble Co.'s chairman, EdwinL. Artzt, conceded in a letter to employees that theconsumer-products company had &quot;made an error in judgment&quot; inencouraging Cincinnati law authorities to search local phonerecords to help identify who had leaked news to a reporterfor this newspaper.   Despite a search of 803,000 records, which was ordered bya local court under a state law prohibiting employees fromdivulging trade secrets, the alleged leaker wasn't caught.Although Pandamp;G's board concluded the company &quot;acted in goodfaith and responsibly,&quot; the episode &quot;ended up reflectingquite badly on what is otherwise a socially conscious&quot;organization, says Robert D. McCrie, an assistant professorfor security management at John Jay College of CriminalJustice in New York.   Marc Rotenberg, who teaches privacy law at Georgetown LawSchool, says Pandamp;G's mistake was to overexpand the definitionof proprietary data. &quot;The key point is you don't get to holdup the trade-secret shield to protect your company frompublic scrutiny,&quot; he says.   The Journal's articles disclosed the resignation of thehead of Pandamp;G's troubled food and beverage business and saidthat Pandamp;G might sell parts of that business.   Leak-plugging efforts can put more than a company'sreputation at risk. Take the case of Edwin Bricker, a workerat the Department of Energy's Hanford Nuclear Reservationnear Richland, Wash. During the mid-1980s, according to areport released last year by the U.S. Labor Department, Mr.Bricker ran afoul of his bosses with repeated complaintsabout the safety conditions at the facility, which producedmaterial for the nation's nuclear weapons under contract byRockwell International Corp. until 1987.   Unsatisfied with the company's response to his complaints,Mr. Bricker eventually began talking with staffers of a Housecommittee and then with reporters. Management became aware ofMr. Bricker's press leaks after other workers informed onhim. Fellow employees were then recruited to report on Mr.Bricker, the Labor Department document says.   Last year, Mr. Bricker filed a lawsuit in Seattle federalcourt alleging that Rockwell and Hanford's subsequentmanager, Westinghouse Electric Corp., violated hisconstitutional rights to free speech and association andinvaded his privacy. The lawsuit seeks damages of $30million.   Both companies have denied the allegations. Rockwelldeclined further comment. A spokesman for Westinghouse won'tcomment specifically on the Bricker case but says the companyhas &quot;bent over backwards to accommodate whistleblowers.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
