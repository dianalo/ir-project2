Hunt   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>02/13/92</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A20</SO><NS>POLITICS (PLT)</NS><LP>   Gov. Mario Cuomo effusively praised both Paul Tsongas, thefront runner in the New Hampshire Democratic presidentialcontest, and the write-in campaign for himself in nextTuesday's important initial primary.   In a telephone conversation yesterday, the New Yorkgovernor insisted that he doubted whether the Cuomo write-ineffort, being waged by three Chicago political operatives,will win many votes, but said his political advisers tell himit's a very professional venture. &quot;I've been told these guysare real pros . . . these guys could be miraculous,&quot; he said.</LP><TEXT>   Moreover, Mr. Cuomo, who continues to say that he won'tenter the Democratic presidential race, added that he thinksthe write-in campaign is &quot;extraordinary and significant&quot; inmany ways. &quot;It bespeaks a significance to push this debateand shows a general sense that we're just not down tobusiness yet.&quot;   The one candidate, though, who he thinks has gotten downto the business of addressing real issues is Mr. Tsongas.Gov. Cuomo extolled the former Massachusetts senator'svirtues, frequently in a fashion that just as easily mighthave been applied to himself.   Sen. Tsongas, he said, is &quot;connecting&quot; with voters becausehe &quot;seems to make the most sense&quot; in talking about the realissues of the economy and jobs. The New York governor -- whosaid he read Mr. Tsongas's book of economic prescriptions andagrees with &quot;a lot&quot; of his ideas while disagreeing with&quot;some&quot; -- congratulated the former Massachusetts senator &quot;fortaking President Bush on&quot; regarding the economy.   He dismissed reservations that some other politicians haveexpressed about whether Sen. Tsongas, a Greek-American fromMassachusetts, would appeal to other regions of the country.&quot;That argument is ridiculous,&quot; he declared. Trying to &quot;depictethnicity&quot; as a political problem &quot;is a lot of crap.&quot; (Somemore conservative Democrats have expressed similarreservations about Gov. Cuomo.)   The New York Democrat said the other Democraticcandidates, especially Sens. Tom Harkin of Iowa and BobKerrey of Nebraska, haven't been able to convey their ideasto the voters yet. The Democrats' recent debate on publictelevision &quot;was very good,&quot; Gov. Cuomo said, but &quot;that hasn'tgotten through to the public yet.&quot;   Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, with whom Gov. Cuomo hasclashed more than a few times, is running into politicaltrouble, he acknowledged. &quot;Bill Clinton is smart, attractive,quick, charming, well-informed, a moderate and a southerner,&quot;Gov. Cuomo said. That created &quot;a very strong presumption ofelectability. But the minute he ran into trouble {withstories over alleged marital infidelity and avoiding thedraft} that presumption was rebutted.&quot;   The architects of the New Hampshire Cuomo write-incampaign are ecstatic that the governor was giving a majorspeech last night at neighboring Harvard University that wassure to attract lots of media attention in the area.Originally, the governor said he would speak just on welfare,but in the past few days decided to broaden it into a largerdiscussion of the economy.   In the prepared remarks, the New York Democrat leveled abroadside against the economic policies of Presidents Bushand Reagan: &quot;Even after the {current} recession, the excessesand short-sightedness of the '80s will leave us fallingfurther behind our global competitors. The nation's economicwound is close to the heart.&quot;   Mr. Cuomo insisted in the interview that despite hispraise for the write-in effort, he's not doing anything tohelp it. He noted he has turned down numerous requests fortelevision and radio interviews in New Hampshire and requeststo speak at the University of New Hampshire and FranklinPierce Law School.   But he displays a keen interest in the political scene.Indeed, Gov. Cuomo said he has even crafted a 28-secondcommercial for Mr. Tsongas. It would say:   &quot;A lot of people like things I'm saying about the economyand think my ideas are good, but they say I'm not electable.It may be because of the way I come across on television.They would have said the same thing about Abraham Lincoln orHarry Truman. I don't think this is so much an insult to meas it is to you. It says you vote for a pretty face. Showthem they're wrong.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
