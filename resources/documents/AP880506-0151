The United States and left-wingIsraelis sought to prevent the deportation.   The move to deport 44-year-old Mubarak Awad was the latestIsraeli action aimed at breaking the back of Palestinian resistancein the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. That resistance has beenbuilt on strikes and other protest techniques Awad advocated.   The United States asked Israel to delay Awad's deportation whileU.S. Ambassador Thomas Pickering met with Foreign Minister ShimonPeres and asked Israel to reconsider the order, Israel televisionreported.   In the occupied West Bank, Israeli troops blocked all commercefor the second straight day. The soldiers shut down shops and gasstations, halted transit and even chased away street vendors.   The government has been trying to force merchants to open andclose on Israeli orders _ not at the dictates of uprising leaders _and troops have threatened to weld shut the doors of shops whosemerchants disobey soldiers' orders.   Authorities arrested an American-born Jewish settler in thefatal shooting of a Palestinian shepherd. Israel radio said policewould recommend charging the settler, Yisrael Zeev, with murder.   Zeev allegedly shot the Arab in the head Thursday when herefused to move his flock from near the Shiloh Jewish settlementnear Ramallah, and some shepherds threw rocks at Shiloh guards,according to Palestinian reports and the radio.   In the occupied Gaza Strip, Israeli troops shot and woundedthree Arab protesters in Gaza City, Shifa Hospital officials said.One of the victims was a 12-year-old boy.   Awad, who runs the Center for Non-Violent Studies in Jerusalem,was presented with a deportation order before dawn after beingarrested at his Jerusalem home. Awad's attorney, Jonathan Kuttab,said his client probably would appeal to the Supreme Court.   Leaders of the 5-month-old Palestinian uprising in the West Bankand Gaza Strip have adopted many of Awad's strategies of peacefulresistance, including commercial strikes, nonpayment of taxes,boycotting Israeli products and sit-in demonstrations against theoccupation.   Avi Pazner, spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, saidAwad was ordered deported because he had gone beyond calls fornon-violent protest and was responsible for leaflets that urgedPalestinians to throw gasoline bombs and rocks.   ``This is preaching violence,'' Pazner said, adding that Awadhad also called for a Palestinian state that would include all ofIsrael. Shamir, who also heads the Interior Ministry, signed thedeportation order.   In a statement delivered Friday by attorney Kuttab, Awad said hesupported the establishment of a Palestinian state alongside Israel.   ``I also believe the Palestinians can get their rights throughnon-violence and a campaign of civil disobedience. This has beenthe message of the uprising.... It is a much better way than ourattempting to kill one another,'' the statement said.   According to U.N. figures, 184 Palestinians have been killedsince the uprising began Dec. 8. An Israeli soldier and an Israeliteen-ager have died.   Kuttab, who met with Awad in jail, said his client was somber.   ``They are trying to cut all his ties with his own country. Itis very serious,'' he said.   The Jerusalem-born Awad, who also has a home in Wapakoneta,Ohio, was in Israel on a tourist visa that expired last November,and he refused an order to leave the country. Awad was allowed toremain following strong U.S. pressure.   Friday's deportation order elicited protests from some left-wingIsraelis.   In a telegram to Shamir, legislator Yossi Sarid said: ``You candeport Awad but not his positions, which are those of a moderatePalestinian. If (Israel) can't talk to Awad, then we really onlyknow how to shoot.''   A group of American Jews living in Israel met with U.S.Consul-General Philip Wilcox to urge American action against thedeportation. ``We protest the discriminatory treatment that Israelmetes out to American citizens depending on whether they are Jewishor Arab,'' said John Ostfild of Minneapolis.   Chief of Staff Gen. Dan Shomron said he believed the measures tochoke off the Palestinian uprising had succeeded in ``starting aprocess of disillusionment.''   ``The (Arabs) now understand they cannot achieve their aimsand...their suffering is for nothing,'' Shomron told the dailyYediot Ahronot.   The daily Maariv reported about 60,000 European tourists hadcanceled plans to travel to Israel because of the unrest. Thenewspaper said 407 charter flights scheduled for April throughOctober had been called off.</TEXT></DOC>
