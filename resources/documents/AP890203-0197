Meteorological officials said it was too early to conclusivelyblame the greenhouse effect, by which heat from the sun is trappedin the atmosphere by gases acting like the glass walls in agreenhouse.   ``While a warming of this amount is consistent with thegreenhouse effect caused by the rise in the levels of carbon dioxideand other man-made gases in the atmosphere, the earth's temperaturefluctuates considerably due to natural causes and no unambigiousconnection can yet be made,'' said David Parker, a climate expert atBritain's Meterological Office headquarters in Bracknell, southernEngland.   It could take 20 years of temperature rises before the greenhouseeffect could be detected with much certainty, he said in a recentinterview.   The apparent warming trend was revealed in analyses of globalweather records by the Meteorological Office and the University ofEast Anglia in Norwich, southeast England.   Their work showed that 1988's global average temperature was 57.2degrees Fahrenheit, 0.5 degrees higher than the 30-year globalaverage ending in 1979.   Since 1979, the succession of tiny increases has been too steadyfor the weathermen to ignore, Parker said.   The six warmest years in the century have all been in thisdecade, he said. They were 1988, 1987, 1983, 1981, 1980 and 1986, indescending order of warmth.   Global temperatures have risen by about 0.8 degrees since thebeginning of the century, he said.   Britain has had a mild winter, with temperatures averaging 5degrees above the normal temperature of 40 degrees in December andJanuary.   Spring flowers are shooting up and blooming, and a blackbirdnested and reared its young two months early in a department store'soutdoor Christmas tree in Cheltenham, southwest England.   The debate over whether there is a greenhouse effect has beenfueled by unusual weather patterns in recent years, including aserious drought in the United States last summer.   Last week, U.S. scientists said they could find no evidence ofany overall temperature increases for the United States from 1895 to1987.   But they stressed that the United States makes up only 6 percentof the earth's surface and said studies of other portions of theearth could have different results.</TEXT></DOC>
