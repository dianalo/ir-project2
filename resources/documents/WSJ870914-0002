Generally perceived as an &quot;original intent&quot; or &quot;interpretivist&quot; scholar, Judge Bork has found himself attacked as well by the libertarian right for a jurisprudence that is allegedly too majoritarian to afford certain liberties their proper status under the Constitution.    Stephen Macedo of Harvard has written that &quot;Bork's version of the Constitution is deeply at odds both with {its} text and structure.&quot; Legal thinkers such as Mr. Macedo have been promoting economic civil rights -- judicial enforcement of individual freedom in such areas as contract, property rights and eminent domain.    The contrasting views of conservatives on such matters are perhaps best summarized by an often-quoted 1985 debate between Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, then a Circuit Court judge, and Richard Epstein, the University of Chicago professor who has been the leading proponent of a revitalization of economic rights. There, Mr. Epstein argued that the Constitution &quot;contains many broad and powerful clauses designed to limit the jurisdiction of both federal and state governments&quot; over economic affairs, and urged a &quot;principled judicial activism&quot; to protect individual economic liberties from legislative encroachment.    Meanwhile, Justice Scalia feared that judicial activism in the economic arena would lead to other, more serious abuses. &quot;What would you think,&quot; he asked rhetorically, &quot;of a substantive-due-process, constitutionally guaranteed, economic right of every worker to a 'just and favorable remuneration ensuring for himself and his family an existence worthy of human dignity?'&quot; The conventional wisdom holds that Judge Bork falls into the same interpretivist faction as Justice Scalia and other prominent conservative thinkers such as Lino Graglia of the University of Texas, who place particular stress on restraining the activity of the undemocratic judiciary and are skeptical of any effort to urge a new round of activism.    However, Judge Bork's views on economic rights indicate that he does not fit in to this debate as neatly as is often asserted. For example, in a 1983 article in the magazine Regulation, Judge Bork wrote that he had deduced from the Bill of Rights &quot;a series of very libertarian positions.&quot; He wrote, concurring with a major theme often raised by Messrs. Epstein and Macedo, that &quot;there is no principled philosophic difference between individual economic freedoms and individual freedoms of other sorts. . . .&quot;    Most important, especially from the perspective of an original intent scholar, Judge Bork went on to say that &quot;the Constitution contains a variety of clauses that WERE INTENDED TO, did, and to some extent still do, protect such freedoms. Since the framers of the Constitution thought that such matters deserved to be included, that in itself is a reason of considerable persuasive power for us to think that, as a matter of principle, such guarantees may still have a place.&quot; (Emphasis added.)    Judge Bork thus seems to accept the case for economic liberties, even within his framework of interpretive analysis. Indeed, rather than hinging on philosophical issues, Judge Bork's reservations on economic rights centered on more practical concerns. He feared that no amendment could be made airtight enough to survive the selective application of judges, or a hostile political or intellectual climate. In fact, in substantiating these fears, Judge Bork again essentially concedes that economic freedom is a component of the Constitution: &quot;We already have clauses that could be used to protect economic freedom -- and were so used. They are, however, so open-textured, so general, that judges were free to impose their own economic policies -- and they did.&quot;    Two years later, however, in an interview with the Manhattan Institute, Judge Bork backed off somewhat from his earlier position. He emphasized the importance of determining the original intent of the framers on these issues and expressed concern that, given the highly interventionist policies practiced by some of the colonies during the Revolutionary era, the historical evidence might not support the call for economic liberties. Nevertheless, he reiterated that he was &quot;not hostile to economic liberties, constitutionally enforced, provided you can show me that that is what the framers intended. . . . If Prof. Epstein has historical evidence that justifies what he is suggesting, that's fine.&quot;    This &quot;show me&quot; attitude seems on the one hand to fit neatly within the interpretivist framework of basing decisions on the intent of the framers. Yet, by remaining open to the possible legitimacy and desirability of constitutionally enforced economic rights, Judge Bork seems to depart somewhat from the camp to which he has often been assigned. He does not assume that the argument for economic liberties needs to be grounded in the doc trine of substantive due process, which he has vociferously opposed (it holds that judges should have wide latitude in determining what unwritten freedoms are protected by the &quot;due process&quot; clauses of the Constitution).    Instead, Judge Bork is looking directly to the text of the Constitution for guidance and thus approaches the issue with the goal of determining if an array of economic rights is explicitly protected by the text -- prior to any judicial extrapolation under substantive due process. This is where it becomes even more apparent that, the arguments of Mr. Macedo and others notwithstanding, Judge Bork's methodology is not necessarily incompatible with the libertarian view on these issues. For even Mr. Epstein has argued that &quot;the economic substantive due process cases {of the late 19th and early 20th centuries} represent the displacement of concerns properly within the ambit of the contract clause.&quot;    Those eager for a rehabilitation of economic rights need not be disenchanted by the fact that Judge Bork has not yet been &quot;sold&quot; on the issue. His statements reveal an honesty and rigor of approach that, if adhered to, will prevent conservatives from resorting to the kind of free constitutional interpretation that has been the object of their dissent for so long. As Mr. Epstein has said, &quot;Without sound, textually based constitutional interpretation, the shape of the law becomes subject to competing value preferences.&quot;    Moreover, we should not underestimate the ability of justices to be persuaded, even on such fundamental issues. Recall that just two years after his debate with Mr. Epstein, Justice Scalia authored a major property-rights opinion in which he struck down a state zoning regulation by saying, &quot;We read the Fifth Amendment's property clause to be more than a pleading requirement, and compliance with it to be more than an exercise in cleverness and imagination.&quot;    ---   Mr. Shuchman is assistant director of the Manhattan Institute's Project on Civil Justice Reform.
