Tax collection officers, employment counselors, graininspectors, office clerks and others are to remain off thejob beginning the first-ever general strike by the Canadianpublic service. Daryl Bean, president of the Public ServiceAlliance of Canada, the union representing the workers, saidthe strike will bring government services &quot;to a halt&quot; withina week.</LP><TEXT>   The main issue in the dispute is the government's wagerestraint program, which provides employees with no wageincrease this year and increases of 3% in each of the nexttwo years. The measure, which was announced in thegovernment's February budget, is part of a plan to cutfederal spending and reduce inflation by holding down wages.   The restraints are &quot;an important symbol,&quot; said MichaelGregory, Royal Bank of Canada economist. &quot;If the governmentknuckles under, it could lead to higher wage demands in othersectors of the economy&quot; and delay further cuts in Canadianshort-term interest rates, he said.   The strike is the second major work stoppage to hit Canadain the past two weeks. Postal workers began rotating strikeslast month to protest government cuts in postal services.They have since returned to work while negotiations continue.   Gilles Loiselle, the minister responsible for the publicservice, said the government will legislate its employeesback to work if the strike causes serious disruptions.   He said the government will be able to maintain mostoperations because several thousand of its employees aredeemed to provide essential services and are prohibited fromstriking. But the walkout is expected to temporarily disruptsome services including the government's collection of incometaxes and other revenues.   The strike also is expected to delay payments to companiesthat sell goods and services to the government. &quot;Every daythis strike goes on these firms are at risk,&quot; said BrienGray, a vice president of the Canadian Federation ofIndependent Business, an industry group.   Customs officers are among the workers that are forbiddento strike but they have threatened to tie up traffic atCanadian airports and border crossings. That will disruptoperations of companies that rely on imported goods, saidDonald McArthur, president of the Canadian ImportersAssociation.   A spokesman for Ford Motor Co. of Canada Ltd., a divisionof Ford Motor Co., said production at Canadian assemblyplants will be affected if imports of auto parts are delayedfor more than two or three days.   A walkout by grain inspectors will stop all shipments ofCanadian wheat, said Milt Wakefield of the Canadian GrainCommission, the government agency that oversees graininspection.   Services provided by Canadian embassies abroad also may beaffected.</TEXT></DOC>
