New StudyShows How Americans View Jobs---By Cathy TrostStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/30/86</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   A sweeping government survey shows that Americans are strongly attached to their jobs and that many of them want to work more rather than less.    &quot;It says that commitment to work is stronger than a lot of people thought,&quot; says Janet Norwood, commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which conducted the survey. &quot;It also says that women in the labor force are here to stay.&quot;    A special version of the bureau's Current Population Survey, taken of some 60,000 households last year and recently analyzed, contains more complete data on national work routines and preferences than ever before gathered. Among its other findings:    --The traditional 40-hour workweek is alive and well, despite predictions over the past decade that it would shorten. Roughly two-thirds of those surveyed working full time say they work 40 hours a week.    --Moonlighting is steadily increasing, with nearly six million Americans now holding two jobs. The greatest growth is among women.    --Few workers would trade a reduction in income for more leisure or family time; in fact, about a quarter of the workers surveyed said they would like a longer workweek if it meant more money.    --Flexible schedules are becoming more widespread -- but are still available to only about 12% of full-time workers.    The study comes at a time when the Reagan administration and Congress are expected to take up the issue of how to increase America's industrial competitiveness to help reduce the massive foreign-trade deficit. The study's findings may add fodder to debates over whether a more flexible workplace may be needed to enhance productivity and help workers adjust to the traumas of a changing economy.    Moreover, the findings about the strength and permanence of women's ties to the labor force could increase pressure on government and industry to adopt policies addressing work and family issues, including women's pay, benefits, pensions and work arrangements.    Still, the survey is unlikely to generate definitive answers, because its numbers are subject to wide interpretation. At the Bureau of Labor Statistics, for instance, economist Paul Flaim says the study shows that &quot;Americans still have a heavy dose of the Protestant work ethic.&quot;    But John Zalusky, an AFL-CIO economist, says he thinks the explanation has more to do with a lack of money than an innate compulsion to work. &quot;Spendable income has declined,&quot; he says. &quot;People are working more in order to make more money to meet existing obligations, or they are going into debt.&quot;    Jerome Rosow, president of Work in America Institute, a nonprofit research group, agrees. It may seem incongruous, he says, that employees are seemingly more committed to work at a time when family and other demands are creating pressure for more flexible work arrangements. But, he says, people are responding &quot;to the realities&quot; of the workplace. The economic restructuring resulting from a shift to a service base from a manufacturing base has led to layoffs and job losses, and that has affected workers' sense of security. At the same time, a slowdown in wage increases has heightened financial concerns.    &quot;People really don't have the urge to work more hours,&quot; says Mr. Rosow. &quot;They're doing it because their employer requires it, and that's what it takes to stay in the labor force.&quot;    Generational differences also play a role in the unwillingness to make less and work less. Helen Axel, director of the Conference Board's Work and Family Information Center, says that while younger workers are talking more about the need to balance work and family, their ambitions often override those concerns. &quot;There's more drive to get ahead in this generation,&quot; she says.    Ms. Norwood at the Bureau of Labor Statistics adds: &quot;I need only compare my own sons to my husband and myself. We lived in a small apartment without air-conditioning. Everything is air-conditioned now. We waited to buy a car. . . . People get used to a standard of living that's increased, and it takes a couple of incomes now to maintain that standard.&quot;    The 40-hour workweek became standard during the 1930s, and despite recurring predictions that the number of hours would fall, there hasn't been any erosion over the past dozen years of government record-keeping.    Moreover, about one in four workers surveyed said he or she usually works Saturdays, and one in eight usually works Sundays -- although some of them work those days as part of a normal 40-hour workweek. And the survey found that more than eight million people work at home at least eight hours a week -- most of them full-time employees who do only a small part of their work at home.    A further sign of job attachment: absenteeism rates were lower in 1985 than at any time since 1973, a drop that likely reflected the recession's aftershocks and job uncertainty.    While most workers are satisfied with the number of hours they work, the survey found, the vast majority of those who would like a change would prefer more hours and more money. Even among those making $750 or more a week, only about 10% of the men and 20% of the women are willing to trade income for more free time.    &quot;One of the major issues these days is how we combine work and family,&quot; says Ms. Norwood, and with so many more working mothers, &quot;you would think that . . . we would have gotten a different response.&quot;    She interprets the finding to mean that women are here to stay as members of the labor force. Some people, she notes, expected that once the inflation of the late 1970s was brought under control, then &quot;women (would) go back home because that's really where they want to go.&quot; But she says, &quot;the data don't support that.&quot;    Meanwhile, some 5.4% of all employed workers of those surveyed held more than one job -- up from 4.9% in 1980 and the highest level in more than 20 years. The increase was especially sharp among working women, with 4.7% now holding more than one job. In 1980, 3.8% of working women held more than one job.    The survey also found &quot;evidence of increasing diversity,&quot; including part-time and extended-hours schedules. Compressed workweeks -- in which 40 hours of work is done in four or 4 1/2 days -- grew nearly five times as fast as did total employment during the 12-year period.    In absolute terms, however, workers with such alternative schedules remain few. The same is true with flexible schedules, where workers can vary their starting and quitting times. Only one in eight full-time workers is able to take advantage of such schedules.    &quot;Employers are still not comfortable enough&quot; with such schedules, says Barney Olmsted, co-director of New Ways to Work, a research group based in San Francisco. When employees request unconventional schedules, she says, &quot;you get more 'noes' than 'yeses.'&quot;    ---             TIME AND MONEY: WORKER PREFERENCES      Most people don't want to work fewer hours if it     means earning less money.
