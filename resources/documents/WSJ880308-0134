Robinson III calls his proposed agency for reducing LDC debt &quot;I2D2.&quot; Critics, who seem to abound in places both high and low, think the allusion to film maker George Lucas's spacey robot, R2D2, is appropriate because in their view I2D2 is little more than a literary creation. Yet some critics might agree that the American Express Co. chairman at least has enlarged the debt debate.    Over breakfast last Thursday in Amexco's World Financial Center executive suite, Mr. Robinson discussed how I2D2, his nickname for a proposed &quot;Institute of International Debt and Development&quot; came into being. He had been giving speeches in Japan urging a new &quot;Marshall Plan&quot; for the less-developed countries (LDCs). The Japanese, and the Keidanren business group in particular, asked him to be more specific.    So Mr. Robinson's financial-services engineers designed I2D2. It was described in this newspaper a week ago yesterday and formally presented by Mr. Robinson in a speech to the Overseas Development Council that evening. Banks would sell their LDC paper to I2D2 at a deep discount, say 40%, and receive securities called &quot;consols.&quot; Debtor nations would then pay I2D2 amounts, well below current costs, to service the consols. Old LDC debt would be &quot;subordinated,&quot; theoretically making the LDCs eligible for new loans.    &quot;We wanted to create a reorganization facility,&quot; says Mr. Robinson. &quot;You can't call it bankruptcy because banks can't forgive debt without all sorts of impossible problems. But a facility, just like a trustee in bankruptcy, can say this is what it's going to be.&quot;    Taxpayers of the sponsoring countries -- Americans, Japanese and Europeans primarily -- would have to supply I2D2's capital, just as they now supply capital for the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank and other multilateral development banks. To avoid creating a new international bureaucracy, Mr. Robinson proposes that I2D2 be an adjunct to the IMF and World Bank.    Even before Mr. Robinson floated his plan publicly he knew it would get a cold reception from U.S. monetary authorities. He already had described I2D2 to Treasury Secretary James Baker and shortly thereafter Mr. Baker, without mentioning I2D2, denounced &quot;comprehensive&quot; debtsettlement schemes. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan and World Bank President Barber Conable are known to share the Baker view. The World Bank itself soon will ask Congress for more capital. Banks were not rushing forward to embrace I2D2 either. Lewis T. Preston, chairman of J.P. Morgan andamp; Co. called it a &quot;dead horse.&quot;    The violence of these reactions was partly a result of fears that Mr. Robinson's plan might raise LDC hopes for better deals than they are being offered. Indeed, the I2D2 plan was floated at a sensitive time, just when Brazil and its creditors were putting finishing touches on an agreement to stretch payments on $62 billion in bank credit to 20 years. A tentative agreement was reached last Friday. At the same time, Mexico was considering bank offers to swap loans for U.S.-backed Mexican bonds. Further, Mexico's leaders are engaged in the difficult politics of trying to maintain a fiscal surplus and stabilize the peso, with some prospect of success if they persist.    Mr. Robinson replies that any country holding out for a better deal could be told that if it doesn't cooperate now it will be put at the end of I2D2's queue. Indeed, I2D2 need only be a fallback agency, perhaps accepting only one or two debtors as a demonstration project -- but at least should be up and running should current debt-solution policies break down.    He argues as well that the conditions for I2D2 help would be tougher than the structural adjustment conditions, such as currency devaluations, usually imposed by the IMF and World Bank. Participant nations would be required to open their borders to trade and foreign investment and privatize state industries, so as to engender greater market competition and reduce the drain on national budgets from subsidies and featherbedding. The club in the closet, should they fail to do those things, would be removal of their debt-subordination privilege. Political interests wielding significant power in most LDCs seldom welcome foreign competition and state industries often are vehicles for distributing patronage.    Clearly, the conditions Mr. Robinson defines are good ones. Turkey, for example, voluntarily opened itself up to foreign investment and competition with salutary benefits to economic development. But Mr. Robinson's critics argue that such reforms already are being demanded of debtor nations under the Baker Plan, with promising results. Argentina has opened up areas to foreign oil exploration, for example. Mexico has put a state airline up for sale. Brazil is paring its public sector.    I2D2 critics argue that there is a general tendency, reflected in the Robinson plan, to underestimate the extent to which the debt problem already has been ameliorated. The pressure on the LDCs has been relieved by the decline of the dollar and dollar interest rates. Brazil's long moratorium on bank debt service, while hardly a successful ploy from Brazil's point of view, disguised the fact that it usually had the means to pay. The latest Brazilian rescheduling plan, if accepted by all its bank creditors, will give it access to new borrowing.    Indeed, it can be argued that during the madcap 1970s when banks were shoveling their surplus &quot;petrodollars&quot; into &quot;sovereign-risk&quot; loans, the LDCs developed an unhealthy addiction to external financing. Only now that such financing is hard to come by are the political factions in those countries facing up to the imperatives for market reforms.    As for the banks, they have been setting their own houses in order. Most have significantly worked down their LDC debt exposures, relative to capital, and have set up substantial reserves to cover write-downs. Regional banks have been withdrawing quietly from the scene by ridding themselves of LDC paper. New instruments, debt-equity swaps for example, have relieved problems with a few countries -- Chile, for example.    If banks were in such a big hurry to take a 40% &quot;haircut,&quot; a la I2D2, why were so few of them willing to tender their debt in exchange for the Mexican bonds last month? one I2D2 critic wants to know. Mexico was able to achieve only a $1.1 billion debt reduction, vs. a hoped-for $10 billion, when it was asking banks, effectively, to take only a 30% haircut.    In short, the critics are saying that any &quot;comprehensive&quot; solution would, in effect, be an organized default. And they doubt that the mere fact of subordinating old debt would make it easier for debtors to find new money. Indeed, recognizing that their chances for new money probably would vanish, they might demand that the banks take an even bigger bath. Why offer them a chance for partial default when most LDCs now believe that default would only damage them further?    Mr. Robinson thinks his critics make too much of such objections. He says that banks simply have never learned to &quot;mark to market&quot; the way the securities industry must do. Perhaps so, but for the time being at least, it appears that I2D2 will have trouble gaining any altitude. </TEXT></DOC>
