Traders noted that the OTC's major index regained about25% of its first-hour loss, but found little reason foroptimism in the face of the crisis in the Persian Gulf.</LP><TEXT>   The Nasdaq Composite Index lost 8.91, or 2.3% and closedat 379.68, its third consecutive loss. The index had fallenabout 13 points before a late morning rally.   At the opening bell, OTC stocks followed the Big Boardlower, recording major losses in the first hour of trading.Both rallied at midday. But while the listed stocks fell inthe afternoon, OTC stocks eased higher.   The New York Stock Exchange Composite Index closed 1.9%lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 52.48, a 2%loss.   Traders are at a loss to explain the upward creep of theOTC market in the afternoon while Big Board stocks languishedlower.   John Schraff, an equities trader for Daiwa SecuritiesAmerica, suggests it may be merely a matter of timing.   &quot;Secondary issues were beat up a lot worse,&quot; Mr. Schraffsays. &quot;They may be seeing their bottoms at different times.&quot;   At Alex. Brown andamp; Sons, William Rothe, managing director ofequity trading, saw some short-covering in OTC issues and afew investors picking up a rare bargain.   &quot;The mood still remains cautious,&quot; Mr. Rothe says. &quot;Itwill take good news out of the Middle East to get some formof technical rally.&quot;   Volume increased dramatically to 166.4 million shares fromMonday's paltry 115.5 million shares. Decliners led advancingissues 1,747 to 458.   MCI Communications was by far the most active OTC issue.MCI traded 3.7 million shares, nearly double its dailyaverage of 2.1 million shares.   Much of the interest in MCI began with its morningannouncement that it might write off about $500 million inthe third quarter to convert its analog systems to digital.MCI also said it would spend about $1.1 billion in 1991 onthe conversion.   The market sent MCI about two points lower at the outset.By afternoon, investors began buying and nearly cut MCI'sdecline in half. It finished the day at 33 5/8, down 1 1/8.   Gaining issues weren't easy to find on the closing tape.But late shopping in some technology issues pushed Novell 15/8 higher to 22 3/4 and Oracle Systems 1/8 higher to 13 5/8.Sun Microsystems reversed early losses to end unchanged at26.   Alex. Brown's Mr. Rothe suggests that investors lookingfor selective opportunities may be scouring the roles of thebattered technology issues for a bargain or two.   Of course, not all technology stocks avoided declines.Intel lost 1 to 32 1/4. Apple Computer fell 1/2 to 36 1/4.Microsoft also rebounded from early lows but still closed 11/4 lower at 54 1/4.   Cellular stocks suffered too. McCaw Cellular declined 1/2to 18 3/4. LIN Broadcasting fell 1 5/8 to 57. Contel Cellularwas down 1 3/4 to 14. Nationwide Cellular Service stumbled 1to close at 4 3/4.

The Britishinformation and trading systems giant, Reuters, gave upground again, dropping another 2 points to close at 44 3/4.And International Lease Finance dropped 1 1/2 to 27 1/2.

Stuart Hall shares rose 5/8 to 10 5/8.   Prospect Group traded more than 10 times its average dailyvolume as the company began distribution of its assets as itliquidates. Prospect Group shareholders will receive bothcash and the stock of subsidiaries. The company's shares fell5/8 to 2 1/8 on 1.6 million shares.   Buy-backs brought disparate responses.   Dionex shares were 1/8 lower at 18 7/8 despite thecompany's announcement that it would buy back as many as onemillion of its 8.9 million common shares.   Andrew added 3/4 to close at 18 on news the company wouldrepurchase one million of its 10.2 million common sharesoutstanding.</TEXT></DOC>
