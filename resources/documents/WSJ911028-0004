But the scale of the project isn't stopping the phonegiants, such as GTE Corp., Ameritech, Bell Atlantic Corp. andPacific Telesis Group, from methodically exploring how bestto implement such systems.</LP><TEXT>   The Baby Bells and GTE have spent several million dollarstesting new systems that carry cable TV shows into homes viathe phone network. The phone companies will spend manymillions of dollars more before they are satisfied that theyhave a video service that matches the current voice phonesystem and that tops today's entrenched cable TV monopolies.   Last week the phone companies were buoyed by a FederalCommunications Commission plan to support a new videotechnology, called video dial tone, that would put the bigphone companies into direct competition with localcable-television companies.   Phone subscribers could use such a system to dial up andorder video programs direct from an entertainment companythrough the same wire that connects a typical phone call.More important, allowing the phone companies into the TVbusiness could generate enough traffic to fund &quot;broadband&quot;super-capacity information highways that could someday carryTV, medical information and even FM stereo channels into ahome through a single wire, say the executives.   However, big hurdles remain. The FCC hasn't decidedwhether to let the phone companies participate in theprogramming end of the cable TV business. The phone companiesargue that's a financial necessity, because cable TVcompanies would be reluctant to share the programs they nowdevelop and support and run them over a rival's network. Inaddition, the 1984 Cable TV Act, which prohibits phonecompany participation in the cable business, would have to berewritten.   &quot;We're encouraged by the FCC action but it is not ascomplete a step as there needs to be made,&quot; says Larry J.Sparrow, vice president of regulatory and governmentalaffairs at GTE Telephone Operations, Irving, Texas. AddsKathleen Ahern, Nynex Corp.'s director of federal regulatorypolicy: &quot;For us to build facilities without anyone to usethem would be irresponsible . . . . Programming isessential.&quot;   There are also technical issues such as whether TV serviceto the home should be provided through a cable-TV-likecoaxial cable or advanced fiber-optic line. Either wouldrequire pulling out existing &quot;twisted-pair&quot; wiring that nowbinds the phones in homes and most small businesses to thelocal phone network. Moreover, the phone industry must stillhammer out technical standards for melding videotransmission, which requires tremendous transmissioncapacity, with voice traffic, which uses far less.   The system that is finally built will require mountains ofcapital to transform the existing phone network into ahigh-capacity network of systems that pump signals digitallythrough fiber-optic transmission lines, which are glasswires. &quot;We've seen figures that it would cost about $250billion nationwide,&quot; says James R. Young, vice president ofregulatory and industry relations at Bell Atlantic. Adds Ms.Ahern, &quot;I don't think our plans would have us doing this inless than 20 years and if we do you're talking billions ofdollars.&quot;   Pacific Bell, which spends about $1 billion a year on newnetwork equipment, would see that annual tab jump by two tothree times in the first several years of constructing abroadband network, says Michael Bloom, director of customerpremise, broadband applications, at the San Francisco-basedunit of Pacific Telesis Group. But he notes that as equipmentpurchases grow and the technology is perfected the annualcost should drop down to current levels after about fouryears.   PacBell, like other phone companies, has already installedfiber-optic &quot;trunking&quot; lines to carry bulk traffic betweenits switching centers. It has also begun replacing copperfacilities in some neighborhoods, running optical fiber tothe pedestal at the curb and then connecting this to theregular home phone wires. Someday these lines will carrycable TV, but for now regulation restricts the phone companyto voice and data transmission, says Mr. Bloom.   Someday this will change, says the FCC, which envisions aservice where phone customers would turn on their TVs andfind a listing of TV shows, movies, news and other programs,supplied by the phone company and other programmers andaccessible via remote control.   Several phone companies are already testing such services.In Cerritos, Calif., GTE has built an elaborate network offiber-optic and coaxial cable lines and advanced switchingsystems to deliver TV services to several thousand phonecustomers. One service, called &quot;Main Street,&quot; allows acustomer with a remote control to shop via TV, check a bankaccount and even seek information on colleges in the U.S.Another service, dubbed &quot;Center Screen,&quot; lets 3,900residential customers call for a movie or TV show by dialinga special number. A third service lets some customers talk toone another through a videophone in the house.   &quot;We've found {from the Cerritos tests} that our customerslike full-motion video and not still pictures,&quot; which is allthat's possible over today's regular phone lines, Mr. Sparrowsays.   That's because regular conversation travels over phonelines at the rate of 64,000 bits a second. By contrast,&quot;reasonable quality&quot; video, such as the kind that appearsfrom a VCR tape, requires transmission capacity of at least1.3 megabits to 1.5 megabits a second, Mr. Bloom says.High-quality video will take capacity of 45 megabits to 90megabits a second, he says. A megabit equals one millionbits.   To save money and get as much capacity out of theirexisting copper-based systems, Bell Communications Research,the Baby Bells' research arm, has developed &quot;videocompression&quot; technology, which uses existing copper wire todeliver TV to the home. With video compression, a tinymicroprocessor squashes video signals so that they can besent through a regular phone line at the rate of 1.5 megabitsa second. The little chip, which is in an electronic boxattached to the phone line, looks at an incoming video signaland filters out parts of the moving image that are redundant.Then the chip codes and sends the parts of the signal thatare different through the phone line to a receiving box,which decodes and reconstructs the image before projecting iton the TV screen.   The cable companies hope to retaliate by providing phoneservice through their cable networks. They are funding theirown research to develop switching systems that can pass phonecalls from one cable subscriber to another and out tocustomers using the regular phone system.   But the blood between the two industries isn't all bad.Ameritech's Indiana Bell subsidiary and CardinalCommunications, an Indiana cable TV operator, are testing afiber distribution system made by Broadband TechnologiesInc., of Raleigh, N.C. The system is being used to routevideo and phone signals over backbone fiber-optic lines andfinally through coaxial and twisted-pair lines attached tohomes in Tipton Lakes, a Columbus, Ind., residentialdevelopment. Bell Atlantic is negotiating with LoudonCablevision, a cable TV company in Loudon County, Va., totest the transmission of TV signals through phone companylines to 5,000-6,000 homes in The Cascades, a local housingdevelopment.</TEXT></DOC>
