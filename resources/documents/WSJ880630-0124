GATX/CL Air is a venture between GATX Leasing Corp. of the U.S. and the Credit Lyonnais banking group of France. GATX Leasing is a wholly owned subsidiary of Chicago-based GATX Corp., which currently owns and leases 52 commercial airplanes to major foreign and domestic carriers.    This was the first announcement of an order for the Airbus planes since the crash of an Air France A-320 jet at an air show in France Sunday. A spokesman for GATX Corp. said the purchase was negotiated long before the accident.    A GATX official said the venture plans to eventually expand its fleet to 20 planes, requiring a total investment of about $650 million. A Credit Lyonnais official said GATX/CL Air is interested in bringing other participants into the venture and in broadening its holdings beyond the A-320.    The 10 Airbus planes GATX/CL Air ordered will be powered by CFM 56 engines made by CFM International, a joint venture between General Electric Co. of the U.S. and France's state-owned Snecma. </TEXT></DOC>
