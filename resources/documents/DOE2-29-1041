It is noted in this report that a study was undertakenin 1985 to determine the feasibility of doing this. On the basis thatthe projected production levels of oil sands/heavy oil would be realized,this study found that 10.5 to 17.3 megatonnes of subbituminous coal wouldbe needed annually as steam-injection boiler fuel (including conversionof existing gas-fired units). This figure represents 70-110% of currentsubbituminous production. Economic viability, technical acceptability,transport, and environmental considerations were also studied. It wasconcluded that the projected production in the oil sand/heavy oil areaswas sufficient to allow coal to become economically competitive withnatural gas for steam injection boiler fuel, and that proven reservesare more than adequate to satisfy demand for 25 years. Economics of coaluse were most sensitive to changes in natural gas prices and capitalcosts. This paper also summarizes work being done in the Coal CombustionResearch Program, which includes a project for coal use in enhanced oilrecovery, and designing of innovative coal-fired steam generators andcombustors. 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
