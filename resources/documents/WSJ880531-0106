And sometimes they fly to Washington for weekend vacations. Cement tycoon Amalia Lacroze de Fortabat looks out from the glossy pages of Town andamp; Country magazine, surrounded by her tens of millions of dollars in paintings by Pissarro and Monet.    Argentina's industrialists are prospering. But their biggest customer -- the government of Argentina -- is nearly bankrupt. It would like to end the industrialists' cozy monopolies and uncompetitive trade practices.    The face of Treasury Secretary Mario Brodersohn has become lined and tired. Economics Minister Juan V. Sourrouille and central-bank president Jose Luis Machinea also look as though the country's troubles have taken a toll on them. As Argentina's top economic officials, the three men are fighting a long and frustrating war to bring certain free-market principles back to Argentina's economy, which has slipped to 58th in the world; it was the eighth largest after World War II.    The economic team is struggling to keep the hands of the Roccas and other subsidy-hungry industrialists out of the government's cookie jar, while trying to ensure that more corporate tax revenue pours in. It's quite a struggle: Until only recently, just 92 of the nation's 300 biggest companies paid income tax.    Argentina desperately needs more foreign credit or a reduction in its obligations if it is to keep servicing its foreign debt and trying to restructure its economy. To bolster international support for his country, President Raul Alfonsin is visiting the U.S. this week for meetings with senior bankers and international agency officials.    Meanwhile, the struggles in Buenos Aires continue. Protected industrialists still exploit the government: A unit of Mr. Rocca's huge industrial conglomerate, Organizacion Techint, charges the state energy company more than twice the customary international price for gas pipes and oil pipes, according to a confidential report to the government by a Techint customer.    Paolo Rocca, one of Roberto Rocca's three sons and the head of the pipe unit, Siderca, denies the company is overprotected. He claims there is protection -- in the form of guaranteed prices for Argentine manufacturers -- equal to about a third more than the international market value of the pipes. Siderca, he says -- implying a concern for the national interest -- takes advantage of only about half the protection available.    Siderca is the only Argentine company that makes the steel pipes that the oil and gas industry needs, and it is guaranteed business under regulations requiring that a large percentage of supply contracts be allotted locally.    Mr. Rocca claims this isn't unusual. British Steel gets similar protection for its pipe sales to oil and gas companies in the North Sea, and the U.S. is protectionist, too, he says.    Siderca also is investing in Argentina, building a huge new steel plant, which Mr. Rocca says will cost about $600 million and is currently the largest capital-investment project in Argentina. He acknowledges, however, that much of the money is being put up by the state at subsidized rates. &quot;You couldn't do it otherwise,&quot; he says.    While the Argentine economy has deteriorated, the Roccas and many other local industrialists have done well. Successful Italian steel barons in the 1930s, the elder Mr. Rocca and his father moved the business to Argentina after World War II. Techint group now ranks among the 10 largest companies in the country. And the Roccas have also re-established their business in Italy.    But for the first time in decades, there seems to be a political consensus in Argentina that the closed economy and the kind of protectionism that benefits families like the Roccas should be changed. The government promises more competition and more care in awarding contracts. Ms. Fortabat's Lomas Negras company -- the country's largest cement producer -- has prospered primarily from government construction contracts.    Even the main opposition party, the populist, left-leaning Peronists, indicate that if they come to power in next year's elections, they will continue the current dismantling of regulations that protect inefficient and uncompetitive industries and allow them to prosper from state contracts.    The Roccas &quot;are among the most powerful people, very intelligent; they have allocated their resources very well, but mostly based on protection,&quot; says Eduardo Amadeo, the president of Banco de la Provincia de Buenos Aires and an adviser to Peronist presidential candidate Antonio Cafiero.    Argentina and the efforts of its economic team are much on the minds of the nation's creditors. With $54 billion in foreign debt, Argentina is closer to running out of money than such other heavily indebted nations as Brazil and Mexico. At one point this year, Argentina fell more than $700 million behind on interest payments to its foreign bank creditors, of which U.S. banks are the single largest group. It now is again slipping behind and has yet to make most of its bank debt interest payments for April and May. Argentina also needs a successful free market to help consolidate its December 1983 shift to democracy from military government.    In the first serious attempt to reform the economy in decades, Mr. Sourrouille and his economic team are struggling to close loopholes in what may be the leakiest tax system in the world. They are cutting subsidies and privatizing state entities. The program is slowly having some effect: The government's first-half deficit is expected to be its lowest in years. But much remains to be done. It can take 10 to 12 years of litigation and a trip to the highest court to force an Argentine to pay his taxes. &quot;You may end up only putting the corpse in jail,&quot; says Mr. Brodersohn.    Many of Argentina's rich and powerful industrialists are understandably resistant to change. Eduardo de la Fuente, the chairman of Union Industrial de Argentina, the national employers' organization, argues that the government is doing too much too quickly, and he derides new corporate taxes devised by the economic team. Change must be &quot;discussed, analyzed and gradual,&quot; says Mr. de la Fuente, who owns a machine-tool business.    Arnaldo Musich, a former Argentine ambassador to the U.S. who acts as roving emissary for the Roccas, says the government is very hostile to business. He criticizes the taxes now being raised from companies.    Industrialists say they are willing to see some change, but only some. Eduardo Gruneisen, who helps his father run a family-owned energy company, Astra Oil, says he welcomes competition from foreign oil-and gas-exploration companies. But, Mr. Gruneisen adds, YPF, the state-owned oil company, probably should continue, at least for the time being, as monopoly producer and distributor of energy. Critics, of course, assert that that would leave the country's protected and undercapitalized energy industry pretty much as it is. And energy-rich Argentina would, absurdly, continue to import large amounts of oil.    The economic team is &quot;facing the opposition of the entrepreneurs who are very happy selling to the state,&quot; says Javier Gonzalez Fraga, a Buenos Aires economist and consultant. &quot;The entrepreneurs are powerful because of rules imposed 40 years ago. They are the sons of a closed economy, but they are the ones who put money into political campaigns.&quot;    Some political analysts say that Mr. Rocca and other powerful industrialists tried to unseat Mr. Sourrouille and his team last winter when the government began a drive to change the country's deeply ingrained economic ways. Then, about 50 congressional deputies of the ruling Radical Civic Union Party suddenly deserted the team's proposed tax-reform package, which included measures to force companies to pay taxes. The anti-tax effort failed because the Peronist opposition rallied to the government's side. In response to suggestions that industrialists are, or have been, undermining the government, Paolo Rocca says the economic team is &quot;paranoid.&quot;    It isn't just protected industrialists who are restive. Teachers also went on strike in recent months for a minimum wage of $80 a month, and pensioners have demanded increased benefits. More ominously, bombs were recently set off in Buenos Aires movie theaters, apparently by members of a right-wing group linked to the military.    Even the ruling Radical Party has reservations about its own economic team and recent tight-money policies, high interest rates and recession. Party members obscenely denounced Mr. Sourrouille at a recent political meeting at a Buenos Aires soccer stadium.    Dealing with such problems has taken a personal toll on the economic team's leaders. A now-paunchy Mr. Brodersohn says he once played tennis regularly and went jogging four times a week. But that was before he became treasury secretary in 1985. He says his wife complains that she never sees him, and, he quips, there isn't time to have a girlfriend.    Negotiations with foreign creditors have members of the Argentine economic team flying around the world on a tight schedule. Last year, in little more than a week, Mr. Brodersohn and central-bank director Daniel Marx flew from Buenos Aires to Tokyo to New York to Washington to Toronto to Paris to Frankfurt to Paris (again) and back to Buenos Aires.    One gets a glimpse at how Argentina's protected economy works in a confidential report submitted to the government earlier this year. The document alleges that Techint gets unrealistically high prices as the sole domestic supplier of steel pipes to the country's large oil and gas industry. The main customer for such pipes is the government's energy company.    The report, compiled at the urging of the government by Pluspetrol, a private energy company, asserts that Siderca, the Techint unit, charges $51.06 a meter for standard piping in Argentina, yet it sells similar pipes abroad at the internationally competitive price of $22.47.    Pluspetrol has to buy these pipes at the domestic price, although it obviously would prefer to pay the cheaper international price. The economics ministry has recently encouraged companies to submit reports outlining how they are put at a disadvantage by Argentina's protected economy.    According to the report, Siderca doesn't offer discounts for quantity or prompt payment. It also has what's tantamount to a captive market: Oil and gas companies here are allowed to import no more than 48% of their pipe needs. &quot;Import rights are the instruments used to protect local industries,&quot; the report says.    The government is clashing with Techint over government plans to open the steel and petrochemical industries to international competition. Government officials say that, in retaliation, a Techint unit -- Propulsa -- is threatening to close a steel plant in Ensenada, in Buenos Aires province. &quot;We can import much more cheaply what Propulsa makes, but there are 3,000 jobs at stake,&quot; says Juan Pablo Lohle, a lawyer who advises Mr. Cafiero, the Peronist governor of Buenos Aires province.    Trying to improve the efficiency of state industries and to raise money for investment in this nation with virtually no capital market, the government has agreed to sell to foreign investors 40% chunks of the state telephone company and the national airline. It's a measure of the public's dissatisfaction with the state-dominated economy that labor unions at the two companies voted in favor of the agreements.    The government also has devalued the currency substantially to make exports more competitive, and in mid-April it began phasing out price controls.    Many of the hundreds of legal loopholes in the tax system, which have allowed about 75% of Argentine companies to submit returns asserting that they owe nothing, are being closed. Until last January, costs for such &quot;risk investments&quot; as oil and gas exploration were completely taxdeductible. Now only 50% of such costs can be written off.    The government now also requires companies to deposit money with the state for three years at below-market rates of interest, in effect a forced-saving tax.    The need for such measures is clear. Federal tax revenue totaled just 10.5% of the nation's output of goods and services in 1987, slightly less than half of what is collected in the U.S.    Already, tax revenue is increasing, officials say, indicating that Argentina may come close to meeting its aim of reducing the government deficit to less than 3% of the total output of goods and services. That goal represents a remarkable drop from a government deficit of over 7% last year.    Mr. Brodersohn hopes the economic team can stand the strain. &quot;There's a lot of double talk in Argentina,&quot; he says. And his job, he says, is &quot;like playing simultaneous games of chess, some of them blindfolded.&quot;    ---               Argentina's Bleak Economy      GROSS    INTEREST                  ECONOMIC      FOREIGN  PAYMENTS ON    INFLATION  GROWTH      DEBT     FOREIGN DEBTS  CONSUMER   (% CHANGE  EXPORTS      (In bil.
