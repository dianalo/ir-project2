(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Black andamp; Decker Corp. withdrew its $77-a-sharebid for American Standard Inc. Tuesday, halting the bidding warover the plumbing giant, and allowing a $2.45 billion leveragedbuyout spearheaded by Kelso andamp; Co. to go forward.   Under the agreement reached Tuesday, the Towson-based toolmanufacturer agreed not to purchase shares of American Standarduntil Kelso has had an opportunity to pursue its $78-a-share tenderoffer, according to a Black andamp; Decker announcement.   Under the agreement, Kelso will pay Black andamp; Decker $25 millionfor withdrawing its bid, as soon as Kelso begins purchasing stockunder its tender offer or acquires at least 20 percent of AmericanStandard's shares in any other transaction.   ``Seventy-seven (dollars) was our top price,'' said BarbaraLucas, a Black andamp; Decker spokeswoman. Ms. Lucas said Black andamp; Deckerhad initially thought Kelso's financing would not come through butit appeared Kelso would be able to finance the deal.   A spokeswoman for New York-based American Standard said thecompany had no comment on the agreement.   ``They (Black andamp; Decker) would still be making a deal at $77 ifKelso-American Standard wasn't able to pull it off,'' said analystCornelius V. Sewell of Argus Research Corp. in New York.   Sewell said American Standard's transportation productsdivision, valued at about $600 million, is likely to be sold to payoff the debt incurred by Kelso to purchase the company.   American Standard had resisted Black andamp; Decker's takeoverovertures for months, including a sweetened $2.4 billion, or$77-a-share, offer made last week.   Instead, American Standard agreed to a $78-a-share leveragedbuyout spearheaded by the New York investment banking firm. Lastweek American Standard said its board would recommend Kelso's $2.45billion offer to shareholders.   The agreement reached Tuesday, including the $25 millionpayment, is conditioned on Black andamp; Decker not renewing its takeoverbid for American Standard.   If Kelso terminates its merger agreement with American Standardor fails to purchase shares by May 2, Black andamp; Decker is free topursue the acquisition of American Standard, according to Black andamp;Decker.   Earlier Tuesday, the New York Stock Exchange halted trading inBlack andamp; Decker and American Standard shares for three hours inanticipation of an announcement by Black andamp; Decker.   NYSE Vice President Richard Torrenzano said at the time thatBlack andamp; Decker ``initiated a call'' to the exchange and ``sharedwith us information concerning the American Standard bid whichmaterially could affect the price of their stock.''   No announcement was forthcoming.   Both stocks began trading again at 1:43 p.m. EST. Afterresumption, American Standard rose 12.5 cents to $77 a share whileBlack andamp; Decker was unchanged at $20.125 a share.</TEXT></DOC>
