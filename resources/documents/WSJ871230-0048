The bank, IBJ Schroder Bank andamp; Trust Co., also filed a lawsuit in a state court in Manchester, N.H., seeking to attach some of the utility's property because of the defaults.    The bank's demands, stated in letters to the utility dated Dec. 24, follow a demand earlier this month by Midlantic National Bank of Edison, N.J., that the troubled utility immediately repay $425 million of debentures on which it had defaulted. Midlantic, which acts as trustee for holders of the debt, also filed a lawsuit seeking to attach some of the utility's property.    PS of New Hampshire, whose problems stem from its investment in the stalled Seabrook nuclear power plant, doesn't have the money to pay interest on its debentures. But Schroder's actions, like those of Midlantic, aren't expected to force the utility into bankruptcy court.    The actions appear to represent jockeying for position by the utility's unsecured creditors in case PS of New Hampshire is forced into bankruptcy-court proceedings. However, most of the utility's debt holders want to avoid such proceedings.    Still, the banks' actions may complicate efforts by the utility to restructure its debt. In particular, the banks' attempts to attach the utility's property may motivate other PS of New Hampshire creditors to take similar actions.    &quot;This is an added hurdle to putting a debt restructuring plan in place,&quot; said a utility spokesman. &quot;But we're not planning to seek bankruptcy protection.&quot;    An attorney representing Schroder said: &quot;Our action was necessitated by the prior action of Midlantic.&quot; He declined to elaborate.    Midlantic's action had been expected to put pressure on trustees for other holders of the utility's debt to take similar steps. Otherwise, the trustees might face suits from debt holders they represent charging them with neglecting their fiduciary duties and allowing debt holders represented by Midlantic to gain a stronger position as creditors. </TEXT></DOC>
