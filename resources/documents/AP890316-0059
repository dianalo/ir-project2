The claim brought to seven the number of communist aircraft theinsurgents say they have destroyed this week in fierce fighting forthe strategic city of Jalalabad, 40 miles west of the Pakistanborder.   There was no immediate comment from Afghan government, and it wasnot possible to confirm the claims.   Reports from the Afghan capital indicate Moscow has resumed anairlift of military supplies to Kabul in response to the 10-dayJalalabad offensive, which has had some of the heaviest fighting ofAfghanistan's civil war.   The lastest reports indicate that Afghan soldiers withstood theguerrilla offensive on Jalalabad and that the fighting has reached astalemate.   No reliable casualty figures are available but estimates run inhundreds of dead and thousands of wounded on both sides.   It is the first major showdown between government troops and theguerrillas since Soviet forces ended nine years of militaryinvolvement in Afghanistan on Feb. 15. The guerrillas have foughtthe government since 1978 to establish an Islamic republic inAfghanistan.   Observers believe a guerrilla victory at Jalalabad, a key cityalong the main highway from Pakistan to Kabul, could lead to thefall of the capital, 75 miles to the west.   The guerrilla-run Afghan News Agency said insurgents downed ahelicopter gunship near Jalalabad's television station and anairplane outside the city on Wednesday.   A spokesman for the guerrilla National Islamic Front ofAfghanistan, who demanded anonymity, reported crews of twohelicopter gunships surrendered their craft to guerrillas outsidethe western city of Herat, near Iran.   The guerrillas claim they overran Jalalabad's most importantgarrison, Samarkhel to the east of the city, and were closing in onthe airport.   But Afghan soldiers have retaliated with unexpectedly aggressiveaerial and artillery bombardments which reportedly have stalled therebels' progress.      Fighting now centers on suburbs north, west and south of thecity, according to reports reaching Pakistan today.   ``The regime militas have been offering stiff resistance to(guerrilla) advances,'' said Ijaz Gilani, a Pakistani who monitorsthe war for the semi-private Institute for Strategic Studies inIslamabad.   Leaders of the Pakistani- and U.S.-supported guerrillas havepredicted an early collapse of the Kabul government in the absenceof its Soviet backers, but Afghan President Najib has insisted hisforces are strong enough to survive.   Radio Kabul said Wednesday that over the previous 24 hours, 560guerrillas and supporters were killed and 252 were wounded. It saidthe dead included four Americans, a Saudi national, and somePakistanis.   Pakistan, the United States and Saudi Arabia back the Moslemguerrillas in their war with the communist government but denyhaving any nationals fighting in Afghanistan.   Despite communist claims, guerrilla sources say they have lostonly about 150 men in the offensive and captured more than 700government troops.</TEXT></DOC>
