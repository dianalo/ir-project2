The trade surplus declined to $8.50 billion from $8.72 billion in the prior month, as exports fell 12.1% from October, to $16.59 billion, and imports decreased 20.4%, to $8.09 billion.    The surplus on the current account, which measures trade in goods and services, as well as certain unilateral transfers, narrowed to $8.14 billion from $8.28 billion in October and a record $9.11 billion in September.    Compared with the year-earlier month, the trade surplus grew from a $5.35 billion surplus and the current-account surplus from a $4.52 billion figure.    In discussing the export and import statistics, which are measured when contracts are settled, Finance Ministry officials noted Friday that exports to the Common Market of such products as cars and videotape recorders fell because of restrictions imposed to lessen trade tensions with the 12-nation group. Imports fell partly because Japan reduced the amount of gold it bought; the nation had acquired large amounts of gold earlier this year for use in commemorative coins.    Japan's trade figures are closely watched because the nation is under international pressure to export less and import more. In September 1985, the U.S., Japan and the world's three other largest industrial democracies launched an effort to reduce the dollar's value in order to narrow the wide American trade deficit. The yen has soared against the dollar since then, which has made Japanese exports more expensive. But Japan has continued to post wide trade and current-account surpluses.    As those surpluses have been recorded, however, Japan's export-driven economy has suffered as the strong yen has reduced export volume, hurting corporate sales and profits and causing companies to curb investment and employment.    The monthly trade figures don't wholly reflect the state of Japanese trade, as they are reported in terms of dollar value, not in terms of export and import volume. Yen-based contracts are converted into dollars at the exchange rate prevailing in each month. The yen-dollar rate has stabilized recently, but as the Japanese currency rose against the dollar earlier this year, export contracts denominated in yen converted into an increasing amount of dollars.    As previously reported, the Japanese government last week revised to 3% from 4% its target for economic growth in the year ending next March 31. But that was still above the estimates of many private economists, who think the economy will expand only around 2% in the current fiscal year.    Also last week, the government approved a draft budget containing the smallest spending increase -- 0.02% -- in 32 years and raising concern that not enough will be spent to stimulate the economy.    A variety of other economic statistics released Friday illustrated the state of the Japanese economy:    --Unemployment was unchanged in November from October and September at a seasonally adjusted 2.8% of the labor force. Although the jobless rate is low by international standards, it is high for Japan; earlier this year, the rate reached a record 2.9%. In reporting the November rate, the statistics bureau of the prime minister's office said that the number of workers in the manufacturing sector fell more than 200,000 from a year earlier, illustrating the yen's impact on makers of exported goods.    --A survey of export contracts concluded by Japan's 13 major trading companies indicated that the nation's international trade is likely to remain stagnant in the near future, the Japan Foreign Trade Council said. The group said export contracts negotiated by the 13 houses fell 4.7% in November from a year earlier.    --Vehicle exports fell by the biggest amount since the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association began using its present method of record-keeping in 1979. The group said exports of cars, buses and trucks declined 15.1% in November from a year earlier, to 516,928 vehicles.    Separately, the Finance Ministry said Japanese investors bought a record $2.49 billion of foreign stocks and sold a record $1.81 billion in November, for a net purchase of $686 million, up from $515 million in October. They bought $122.68 billion of foreign public and corporate bonds while selling $114.92 billion, for a net purchase of $7.76 billion, down from $7.92 billion in October.    Foreigners continued to be net sellers of Japanese stocks, buying $4.62 billion and selling $6.91 billion, for a net sale of $2.30 billion, down from October's record $5.46 billion. Foreign investors bought $11.21 billion of Japanese bonds and sold $12.92 billion, for a net sale of $1.72 billion, up from $1.33 billion in October.    The net sales of Japanese stocks and bonds were partly responsible for the record $9.33 billion deficit on Japan's overall balance of payments in November. The balance of payments measures all flows of money into and out of the country.    ---   Japan to Bolster Aid Plan   TOKYO -- Japan has decided to bolster its aid program by recycling some of its huge trade surplus to the Third World and cutting interest rates on government loans to developing countries.    The Finance Ministry announced Friday that it has agreed to raise Japan's private funding of the World Bank by the equivalent of $1.8 billion over a three-year period beginning with the bank's fiscal year starting July 1.    The amount would increase by about 28% the annual flow of Japanese capital through the World Bank. In addition, Finance Ministry officials said the government may donate about $184 million to the bank to subsidize interest rates for borrowing countries during the same period. The grant is subject to approval by Japan's parliament.    In a related move, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Japan would lower interest rates on new Official Development Assistance loans to developing countries. Interest on long-term yen loans would decline by 0.6 percentage point, to 3.1% for loans pledged after Thursday.    The moves follow criticism of Japan for its ballooning trade surplus and an aid program that the U.S. and European countries say is linked tightly to the promotion of Japanese exports.    Japan already had authorized the World Bank to raise $2.2 billion in private funds in the bank's current fiscal year, an amount that constitutes about 20%, or the third-largest portion, of the bank's total funding. The U.S. accounts for 25% of the bank's funding. </TEXT></DOC>
