A special roleis played by the tropical oceans, as very important interchanges of carbondioxide and water vapor are working here. Both gases are important forthe greenhouse effect. A warming of the tropical oceans during the lastdecades and an increase of water vapor at least in parts of the tropics.A release of latent heat via increasing rainfall acts as an additionalheat source in the tropical atmosphere. This has to be respected by climatemodels.</TEXT></DOC>
