The Bush administration last week suspended the 100%duties on these imports as a concession to Japan for agreeingto a new bilateral semiconductor accord. The action is likelyto have little impact, at least immediately, on the businessof Toshiba Corp., the current market leader, or otherJapanese suppliers that already manufacture laptops in theU.S. But U.S. trade officials expect Japanese makers thathave been kept out of the U.S. market by the stiff tariffs tomake a belated entry.</LP><TEXT>   The potential entrants could include Fujitsu Ltd., KyoceraCorp., Citizen Watch Co., Hitachi Ltd., Victor Co. of Japan,Casio Computer Co. and even some of the Japanese steelproducers diversifying into electronics, according to tradestudies circulating within the administration.   Such a fresh challenge might further burden the U.S.computer industry as it tries to recover from the worstrecession in its history. Once-dominant InternationalBusiness Machines Corp. is cutting thousands of jobs, whileCompaq Computer Corp. saw its second-quarter profit tumble81% from the same period last year. And there is renewedconcern here over the possibility that lifting the tariffswill move more jobs overseas.   The products targeted by the tariffs included theincreasingly popular &quot;notebooks,&quot; which weigh only sevenpounds or less and fit in a briefcase. While the U.S. marketfor personal computers hasn't expanded more than about 3%annually, the market for laptops swelled by 32% to more thana million units last year, according to the market researchfirm International Data Corp.   International Data identified Toshiba as the market leaderwith a 20.1% share in 1990; followed by Compaq with 14.5%;Tandy Corp. and its wholly owned subsidiary Grid SystemsCorp. with 13.3%; Zenith Data Systems Corp., a unit of Cie.des Machines Bull, with 9.7%; and NEC Corp. with 4%. The restof the market -- roughly 38% -- is shared by a large group ofU.S., Japanese, South Korean and Taiwanese producers.   The duties were ordered by the Reagan administration in1987 to punish Japan for failing to live up to itscommitments under the 1986 bilateral semiconductor agreement,which expired Wednesday. The Bush administration wasreluctant to lift them because some of those pledges stillremain unfulfilled. But Japanese negotiators insisted theduties would have to be lifted before they would agree to anew chip accord. The new agreement took effect Thursday.   One benefit of the tariff was that it prompted a number ofJapanese suppliers, seeking to find a way around the tariff,to manufacture or assemble their laptops in the U.S. Toshibahas invested $15.2 million in facilities to assemble printedcircuit boards and laptops in Irvine, Calif. MatsushitaElectric Industrial Co., another Japanese supplier already inthe U.S. market, said it assembles its Panasonic brandlaptops in a Tandy plant in Texas. Sharp Corp. said it has asimilar arrangement with Texas Instruments Inc.   The tariffs, however, deterred other Japanese electronicsgiants from testing the U.S. market. Kyocera, for instance,sells laptops in Europe but ships only laptop components tothe U.S. Fujitsu is a rising laptop brand in Asia, but itsproducts have yet to be seen on U.S. shelves exceptindirectly, through its share of another company that makespocket-sized computers that aren't covered by the tariffs.Citizen has gained valuable experience producing earlierCompaq models for other markets and could be another newplayer in the U.S.   Overall, Japanese laptop production has been projected toleap by 25% to 500,000 units this year. Most of the Japaneselaptops that have been exported have gone to Europe,Southeast Asia and Australia because of the prohibitive U.S.tariffs, but trade officials here warn that such prioritiescould change.   Many of the potential Japanese entrants are wary aboutdiscussing their export plans. A Fujitsu spokesman said thefirm hasn't announced any plans for laptop sales in the U.S.But he added, &quot;We aren't dumb. If the sanctions get lifted,you can export easier.&quot; A Hitachi spokesman acknowledged thatthe firm sells a limited number of laptops in Europe but saidthat it has no plans to sell them in the U.S. &quot;Quite frankly,we do not have a customer base in the U.S. right now,&quot; hesaid.   But a spokesman for Seiko Epson Corp. said the removal ofthe duties will give the company more options, includingshipping laptops directly from Japan. Seiko had skirted theduties by assembling some of its laptops in its Portland,Ore., plant and shipping other units from Taiwan and otherAsian countries.   Houston-based Compaq said it is &quot;keenly aware&quot; of thepossibility of new Japanese competition but insists that theburden will be on the Japanese newcomers to prove that theycan grab market share from the established sellers. BruceWalter, Grid Systems president, agreed. &quot;The market isalready so crowded that the issue isn't the product but thedistribution of the product,&quot; he said. Grid's parent, Tandy,has an advantage over other laptop makers because it has anetwork of some 7,000 Radio Shack outlets already in place.   A spokesman for IBM, a relative latecomer to the laptopmarket, said it's still &quot;premature to talk about what theJapanese may do, or how that could affect IBM.&quot;   ---   Jacob M.
