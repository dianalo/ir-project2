<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-06-1140 </DOCNO><TEXT>The microstructure of samples consisting of a 40 nm thick RuO/sub 2/ filmreactively sputtered on a Si andless;111andgt; substrate and covered with 20 nm ofAl(andless;Siandgt;/RuO/sub 2//Al) is investigated by high-resolution cross-sectionalelectron microscopy. The depth distributions of elements are studiedby Rutherford backscattering spectrometry and electron probe microanalysis.In the as-deposited sample, the RuO/sub 2//Al interface is sharp, buta thin (3 nm) SiO/sub 2/ layer is observed at the andless;Siandgt;/RuO/sub 2/ interface.After annealing at temperatures ranging from 450 to 700/sup 0/C for 1-6h, that layer remains unchanged, but a crystalline compound layer formsat the RuO/sub 2//Al interface. No diffusion of Si and Al into RuO/sub2/ is detectable. The possible mechanisms for the barrier characteristicsare discussed. The authors believe that the presence of the thin SiO/sub2/ layer and the formation of an additional compound layer is intimatelyrelated to the good barrier performance of RuO/sub 2/. 14 refs.; 3 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
