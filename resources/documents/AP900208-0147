Meeting behind closed doors, representatives of the 151governments that own the bank approved a $30 million loan forrelief from earthquakes that hit northern China in October. BarberB. Conable, the American who is president of the bank, did not askfor action at this session on $780 million worth of loans he hadpostponed in June.   President Bush later asked that the loans be held up.   China and India are the largest borrowers from the bank. As ofJuly 1, it had lent China nearly $8.7 billion.   A spokesman for the Treasury, speaking anonymously, said a U.S.representative on the Board of Executive Directors supported theloan on Thursday. He said he did not know who was sitting at thesession for the United States. Its official member is E. PatrickCoady, a Treasury official.   Officials of the bank said none of the 22 board members opposedthe loan.   The approval had been foreshadowed Wednesday when Conable put iton the program for Thursday's meeting. The United States is thebiggest shareholder in the bank but does not completely control itsdecisions. The bank occasionally grants loans despite U.S.objections.   Last Friday the U.S. Export-Import Bank signed an unannounced$9.75 million loan with the China National Offshore OilCorporation. The federal agency is expected to announce a largerloan soon.   The World Bank said its loan was granted Thursday through itsInternational Development Association, a fund for the poorestcountries to which the United States makes the largestcontribution. For 10 years, China will pay only interest at lessthan 1 percent, and then will have an additional 20 years to repaythe principal.   At least 29 people were killed in the earthquakes, which cameshortly after the one in San Francisco. The bank said 25,000 homeswere destroyed in Shanxi and Hebei provinces. It is one of theworld's poorest areas, where the bank estimates the average incomeat $89 a year.</TEXT></DOC>
