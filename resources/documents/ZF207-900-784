(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>HOW TO IMPLEMENT PROJECTS CORRECTLYandM;For over 20 years, companies have been depending upon project managementsoftware to bring projects to completion on time and within budget.andP;  And forover 20 years, companies have failed to manage projects successfully despitethe acquisition of software.andM;Today, sophisticated project management software is much more flexible andfriendly than the &quot;batch&quot; mainframe products of the 1970s.andP;  And projectmanagement software today runs on PCs, LANs, minis and mainframes, as well asdistributed environments.andM;But more than just the acquisition of software is required to make projectmanagement work.andM;The following keys to successful implementation of project managementsoftware have been derived from years of consulting experience.andM;* Recognize the unique properties of a project.andP;  A project has propertiesthat set it apart from other management disciplines.andP;  Each project is aunique event.andP;  Project leaders must trade off cost and qualityconsiderations, for what is a visible effort that requires integration ofmany organizations within a company.andM;Each project is assigned a manager who focuses on how to meet a one-timeobjective within a finite budget.andM;The project manager oversees and influences decisions, yet is often in theposition of having more responsibility than authority.andP;  Thus, projectmanagers use project management software tools to automate an existingdiscipline.andM;* Set up the proper environment.andP;  The success of implementing automatedsoftware tools correlates with an effective project management environment.andO;The system can only process the information fed to it: work, time, dates,budgets, resources and schedules.andP;  Therefore, priorities must be set; controlmechanisms must be installed; project scopes must be defined; work breakdownstructures must be set up; and the project manager's responsibility andauthority must be clearly outlined.andM;According to Bill Marks, president of POC-IT Management Services, Inc., SantaMonica, Calif., &quot;A project should be viewed as a capital investment andmanaged like any other large capital expenditure.andP;  The executive committeeshould be making sure that the company is working on the right businessproblems.&quot;andM;* Realistically estimate implementation costs.andP;  Bringing in projectmanagement software is a major investment in dollars, time and resources.andO;Yet, it is often underestimted.andP;  According to Michael Shattow, president ofMultitrak Software, Boston, &quot;When acquiring project management software, itis important for management to realize that the total cost in the first threeyears may be three to eight times the cost of the software.andM;&quot;The cost includes the product selection process [which may take twoman-months or even years], implementation, consulting, training, systemadministration, maintenance and management time,&quot; he said.andM;* Fit the software tool to the project.andP;  Project management is used by MISdepartments as well as many industry groups, such as aerospace, construction,pharmaceutical and engineering.andP;  The needs of MIS differ by industry, withrespect to the number of projects and the database of activities in aproject.andM;MIS staff typically work on more than one project at a time and on projectsof different sizes, ranging from a small maintenance activity to a largethree-year development effort.andM;&quot;Different types of user interfaces are required with different types ofprojects.andP;  There are multiple levels of projects in the same system.andO;Multitrak uses a top-down approach to defining projects,&quot; says Shattow.andM;According to Tom Herring, director of U.S.andP;  marketing for Metier ManagementSystems of Houston, &quot;Using the right project management tool is important.andO;Our project management software, Artemis Team, focuses on aresource-constrained view, which is important for technologically drivencompanies.&quot;andP;  This view pushes back activity dates to wait for resources tobecome available.andM;Products are categorized as high end or low end based upon cost and richnessof their abilities.andM;&quot;A friendly tool minimizes training time,&quot; says Joe Rizzo, president ofComputer Aided Management Inc., Petaluma, Calif.andP;  &quot;An investment in trainingpeople may be costly--even training in the use of the &quot;low-end&quot; tools.andP;  It istherefore important to choose a tool that has full functionality and does notrun out of steam.&quot;andM;* Recognize the true causes of failure.andP;  When project management fails in anorganization, less than half the time it is due to the software.andP;  ChrisMurray, president and cofounder of Applied Business Technology of New York,says, &quot;Tools do not make a good project manager.andP;  Bad project managers failfaster with an automated tool.andP;  Organizations that have done well withproject management have approached implementing the tool as a major projectin itself.&quot;andM;Regardless of the industry or application, project management failsrepeatedly for the same reasons.andP;  &quot;If project management software is not usedeffectively and its benefits are not realized, it may become just a timetracking system,&quot; says John Censor, president of Planning and Control Inc. ofNew York.andM;Lack of commitment by top management is a common cause of failure.andM;According to Allena Lu, president of Systonetics, Fullerton, Calif., &quot;Basedon the level of commitment of a company and the time and energy spent, theresults of project management may vary tremendously.&quot;andM;Says Rizzo, &quot;Project management can fail if commitment to project managementis missing at any level from top management to staff.andM;Another cause of project management failure is a lack of standards andprocedures, and an inability to set up a proper project managementenvironment.andM;* Seek management commitment.andP;  At Squibb in North Brunswick, N.J., projectmanagement is supported from top management down to the project managerlevel.andM;Saul Harrison, vice president of Squibb's Worldwide Engineering andConstruction, is a strong proponent of automated project management systems.andO;He requires that Primavera software be used in the planning and management ofconstruction projects.andP;  &quot;You need to show managers what the software can dofor them; convince them that they need it.&quot;andM;The management at Pacific Gas andamp; Electric in San Francisco, all the way up tothe board of directors, made a commitment to project management.andM;According to Mike McCauley, lead project management engineer for the projectmanagement services department, &quot;Seven years ago project management wasnonexistent.andP;  Since then, the board of directors has issued a policystatement requiring the use of project management.andM;At first the requirement only applied to very large projects, but now it hasbeen broadened, and standards and procedures are in place to ensure thatproject management is uniformly practiced.&quot;andM;BMY-Combat Systems of York, Pa., a division of Harsco Corp., began aconcentrated effort in 1985 to develop a computerized PerformanceMeasurement/Cost/Schedule (PMCS) system to provide information needed tomanage complex government contracts.andP;  It chose VISION/PMS from Systonetics.andM;According to Curtis Stulting, supervisor to PMCS development, BMY's successwith project management followed a commitment by management.andP;  He said, &quot;BMYmanagement provides complete support with budgets for hardware staffing,training and a positive interest in the success of the system.&quot;andM;* Support the project manager.andP;  Integrated project management cannot existwithout a structure that provides dedicated project managers with theauthority to make things happen.andP;  The role of project manager must bewell-defined and must be disassociated with the line management function.andM;The basic principle of project management is that the power base and line ofauthority on a given project moves from the line manager to the assignedproject manager.andP;  Sometimes there are problems when line managers cannotaccept this and consider it a threat.andM;Joe Rizzo says, &quot;The worst type of project management problems are structuralones.andP;  In typical matrix organizations there may exist an inherentproblem--program managers fighting for resources with line managers.andP;  A greatdeal of cooperation between the project manager and people managers isrequired.&quot;andM;* Consider centralized project management support.andP;  A centralized projectmanagement function consults with project managers during project definitionand setup, ensures that project management standards are followed, maintainsstandards and procedures, develops an operations manual, and integrates toolsinto the organization by providing training and consulting.andM;Mead Data Central in Dayton, Ohio, realizes the importance of consistentproject management standards.andP;  Says Jim Finley, manager of Financial Policiesand Reporting, &quot;We have a company-wide project management philosophy thatapplies to all projects.andP;  Otherwise there is difficulty developing the workbreakdown structure.&quot;andM;Mead chartered a task force, including engineers and financial professionalsfrom throughout the company, to determine project management requirements.andO;They met once a week for eight months, to consider reporting cycles,numbering and coding standards, and how to track projects and report design.andO;The task force made recommendations to management, which resulted in theacquisition of Multitrak mainframe software.andM;&quot;The pitfall we fell into initially was trying to be all things to allpeople.andP;  Every department came up with their own activities,&quot; said Finley.andM;This meant the task force was faced with 230,000 activities from over 400managers, each of whom offered acustom work breakdown structure.andP;  &quot;There wasredundancy, and it almost brought down the computer,&quot; Finley said.andM;Things have since improved.andP;  &quot;We now have consolidated and reduced to about30,000 activities.andP;  It certainly would have been better to know this upfront.andP;  Developing a project management philosophy is a continuous process.&quot;andO;He advises, &quot;Don't underestimate the amount of technical support to installand implement the software.andP;  Take what the vendor recommends and multiply itby two,&quot; he said.andM;* Recognize the value of training.andP;  To be successful, product training andproject management concepts aimed at all user levels are necessary--from topmanagement, middle managers and staff.andP;  Training should be offered tosoftware engineers, managers, directors, programmers, team leaders and leadanalysts, and at various levels of detail.andP;  The project management softwarevendors are now emphasizing their training programs.andM;According to Chris Murray, users of Project Workbench were surveyedone-and-a-half years ago.andP;  They found that organizations were not achievingas much as they should from the user of the software.andP;  In response to thesurvey, Applied Business Technology put together a new training program andtrained three to four thousand students during the last two years.andM;The project management software vendors, being concerned about their clients'success with project management, invest a fair amount in training.andM;Primavera Systems Inc., Bala Cynwyd, Pa., has recently published Making ItHappen: A Senior Executive's Guide to Project Management, a booklet relatingto the business issues of managing multiple projects.andP;  And AGS ManagementSystems, King of Prussia, Pa., offers courses in generic project managementtraining, such as &quot;Automated Project Management: Making It Work.&quot;andP;  The courseis intended to assist users of project management software by addressingissues associated with bringing in an automated system.andM;* Pursue a methodology.andP;  Organizations should be using a system developmentmethodology to improve and to structure the planning process.andP;  AGS ManagementSystems has come a long way toward integrating its Wings project managementsoftware with its system development methodology, SDM, through a newintegrating tool called Multicam.andM;Clorox Corp., Oakland, believes in the importance of using a systemdevelopment methodology along with project management.andP;  According to WojciechGasiewicz, Wings administrator at Clorox, &quot;We have used Wings to manage amultimillion dollar, five-year project.andM;&quot;We have incorporated our own in-house developed system methodology, calledSDP, into our project management training and standards.andP;  We teach projectmanagement and SDP at our modern training facility, and we even havevideotapes that we use for training,&quot; he said.andM;&quot;At Clorox, we place a great deal of emphasis on education and training, andSDP is the way we discipline ourselves and apply controls.&quot;andM;Ron Murray, staff manager of Pacific Bell, San Ramon, Calif., also recognizesthe importance of using a methodology along with project management software.andO;He is responsible for the implementation of Case tools at Pacific Telesis.andO;They have consolidated all software into a common set of tools and languages.andO;Pacific Bell has standardized on the tool View Point from Computer AidedManagement Inc.andM;Murray said, &quot;We do not let someone get tool training without methodologytraining.&quot;andM;* Recognize that all projects are not the same.andP;  When selecting andimplementing project management software, it is important to realize that allprojects are not the same.andP;  In the Information Systems (IS) area largeprojects are rare, but these projects need to be tracked on a detailed level.andM;According to Bill Marks, &quot;75% of IS projects are typically very small tointermediate, like minor enhancements.andP;  Senior management requires seeingonly statistical or summary information.andP;  On large projects, seniormanagement needs major milestone-level reporting.andP;  There must be an abilityto inform users and senior management appropriately.&quot;andM;At pacific Gas andamp; Electric, Mike McCauley supports all types of projects--fromconstruction projects to information systems projects.andP;  The products hesupports for smaller projects are Supper Project Expert from ComputerAssociates of San Jose, Calif., and Qwiknet Professional from ProjectSoftware and Development Inc. of Cambridge, Mass.andM;At the high end, as a result of a recent study, the utility selected ViewPoint from Computer Aided Management Inc.; Open Plant from Welcom Software;and Prestige from K andamp; H Professional Management Services of Wayne, Pa.andO;Multiple products were selected to meet the requirements of different typesof projects.andM;In addition to diverse requirements, attitudes toward project management maydiffer by industry group.andP;  According to Bill Phelps, senior consultant withAndersen Consulting of Washington, D.C.,&quot; In some industries, such asconstruction, there is tight control over projects and no cultural resistanceto tracking projects.andM;&quot;In the information systems area, some consider building systems an art, nota science.andP;  We must overcome resistance to estimating carefully andaccurately tracking time and expenses,&quot; Phelps said.andM;* Recognize strength of each platform.andP;  Today, personal computers are usedmore frequently than mainframes as a platform for project managementapplications.andM;APPLICATIONS:andM;PROJECT MANAGEMENTandM;Joel Koppelman, president of Primavera Systems, says project management iswell-suited for PCs because it is an analytical process.andP;  &quot;It is more thanjust collecting cost-to-date information and hours expended, but rather toconsider the impact of work done, the value of what was accomplished and thedetermination of whether or not critical linkages took place.&quot;andM;* Consider software development ties.andP;  Project management software isbeginning to establish connections to Case products.andM;According to Michael Shattow, Multitrak will soon interface with IEF of TexasInstruments, Plano, Texas.andP;  Multitrak will be able to build a project out ofblocks or templates.andM;Applied Business Technology recently extended the power of the ProjectWorkbench system by issuing interfaces to Excelerator from Index TechnologyCorp., Cambridge, Mass.andP;  The interface enables users to link ProjectWorkbench tasks to Excelerator deliverables.andM;According to Shattow, Multitrak will soon interface with IEF of TexasInstruments, Plano, Texas.andP;  Multitrak will be able to build a project out ofblocks or templates.andP;  and project management.andP;  There is a terrificopportunity for the integration of project management and Case tools wherebyproject management systems set up what has to be done by everyone on adevelopment team.andP;  Approximately 60% of our product development is directedtoward this integration.&quot;andM;TRENDS TO WATCHandM;Interface: Many project management software vendors want to improve the userinterface, making the products easier to use.andM;Distributed: Distributed processing in client/server mode is another trend.andO;The workstation user, for example, can run PSDI's Qwiknet Professional in alocal standalone mode or in a connect mode to an identical host-basedapplication.andM;VAX/VMS: Many of the project management software products are now availablein the VAX environment, including Wings, Artemis, Prestige and Open Plan.andM;PC-Mainframe: Several organizations use both PC and mainframe projectmanagement software, with many PC tools possessing an import/exportcapability.andP;  Some of the mainframe systems such as Multi-trak promote an openarchitecture that facilitates the importing of externally generatedinformation from PC applications.andP;  Multitrak accepts external data forconsolidated, multi-project rollups and time-card reporting.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
