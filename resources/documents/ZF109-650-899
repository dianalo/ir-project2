 and are more attuned to the end-user,&quot; said John Logan of the AberdeenGroup in Boston.andM;The architecture is the same - mainframes linked to workstations - but whileSAA only connects IBM machines to other IBM machines, Entire addresses mostmajor platforms including IBM, DEC, Wang and Siemens.andM;Strategy based on ISAandM;The Entire distributed computing strategy, fronted by Entire Function ServerTechnology, is based on Software AG's open Integrated Software Architecture(ISA).andM;ISA allows applications to be processed and implemented independent ofoperating, data communications and database management systems.andM;This is not a new development - ISA was introduced in 1987 and provides thebasis for the company's existing product range, including the Adabasrelational database management system and Natural, the fourth generationlanguage application development and information processing system.andM;However, the Entire announcement marks Software AG's entry into theclient-server arena.andM;The company says its goal is to give companies the freedom to integrate awide range of solutions in an open environment, make hardware and softwaredecisions independent of applications, and migrate to network computing whilekeeping major investments in existing applications.andM;Entire will eventually consist of three modules: Function Server Technology,Application Engineering - to be based on CASE (computer-aided softwareentration - which should allow users to manage the environment for bothapplication operations and development.andM;The company is adamant that Entire does not conflict with IBM's SAA, nor withDEC's Cohesion or NAS (Network Applications Support) strategies.andM;NAS is DEC's applications environment that integrates across interfaces,databases and networks from different vendors.andM;Software AG has a co-operative marketing program with DEC and, as Ted Venema,director of applications product development for Software AG Canada(Cambridge), explained: &quot;Most of the stuff (in Entire) is going to bereasonably high-level ...andP;  We're not trying to re-invent the wheel of how youactually do the communications.andP;  We're trying to provide a business functionthat sits on top of that.&quot;andM;Balter describes solutions like NAS as &quot;hardware&quot; solutions and explainedthat Software AG provides software-based connectivity and is therefore&quot;complementary.&quot;andM;Stuart Woodring of Boston's Forrester Research isn't so sure.andP;  &quot;NAS has verydefinite software implications,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;If you stand up and say, 'SAA' toa council of Digital executives, they'll jump up and shout, 'NAS!'&quot;andM;Balter explained that transparent access to data and applications acrossmultiple platforms is not always possible when using hardware-basedconnectivity solutions because proprietary networking protocols, such asTCP/IP, can get in the way.andM;&quot;People found they have to use the appropriate syntax within theapplication,&quot; he said.andP;  Instead of going for lowest-common-denominatorportability, Entire Function Server Technology incorporates a logicalprotocol of its own that transcends the proprietary standards and allows fortruer application mobility.andM;Balter claims that Software AG is different from database management systemvendors such as Oracle Corp. and Sybase Inc.andM;&quot;We're coming from the mainframe down,&quot; he said, pointing out that SoftwareAG has a very technical background.andM;Venema said Software AG's marketing has been weak in the past for that veryreason.andP;  &quot;We tend to be a little too technical,&quot; he admitted.andM;He says the company is trying to address the issue of marketing and, asWoodring pointed out, Software AG is moving much more into the mainstreamwith its Entire announcement.andM;There are no new products available at the moment.andP;  Software AG has simplyre-positioned its existing ones.andP;  However, Natural Geographic, a geographicdata management system, and Entire SQL, the first in a family of Open SQLservers, are expected in the first and second quarters of 1991.andM;Products will take timeandM;Further announcements should be made in the first half of 1991, and theproducts will be based on Software AG's present technology.andM;&quot;There are definitely pieces of it (Entire) already out in Canada, butthey're not in the technology fashion that we want them to be,&quot; said Venema.andM;&quot;It's going to take a little time to complete.&quot;andM;Analysts are a little skeptical about the prospect of rapid delivery.andM;Woodring estimated it will be &quot;years&quot; before &quot;significant pieces&quot; of Entireare in place, while Logan said: &quot;I would believe that Software AG has agreater probability of delivering its products within the Entire architecturethan IBM has of delivering its (SAA products).&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
