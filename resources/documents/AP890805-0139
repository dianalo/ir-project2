Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, head of the fundamentalist Pro-Islam Party,made the comment at a news conference. His version disputed reportsby the rival Party of Islam that five of its members were killedand 25 were captured and then slain on July 9.   It was Hekmatyar's first public appearance since the fightbetween the rival guerrilla factions.   Mohammad Shaoib, a spokesman for the Party of Islam, said July18 that Hekmatyar's followers killed five Party of Islam members inthe July 9 ambush and killed 25 who were taken prisoners. He saidamong the dead were seven Party of Islam field commanders.   Other rebel sources said the Pro-Islam Party and Party of Islamwere engaged in a power struggle that hindered efforts to overthrowAfghanistan's Soviet-backed Marxist government.   The Bush administration, responding to the July 9 killings, saidit deplored the action but its support to the Afghan rebels wouldcontinue.   Qaribur Rehman Saeed, a spokesman for Hekmatyar's guerrillas,said at the time that some Party of Islam guerrillas had beenkilled in the battle but denied the reports of killings afterward.   Hekmatyar said Saturday that 11 Party of Islam guerrillas werekilled while 30 were seized and ``are being held captive and arestill alive.'' He did not give conditions for their release.   Hekmatyar said his fighters ambushed the Party of Islamguerrillas because they had repeatedly attacked his localheadquarters in northern Takhar province.   He called the battle a ``local, regional conflict'' and not awar between the two parties.   Party of Islam leader Burhanuddin Rabbani has said Hekmatyar'sfaction should be suspended from an ``interim'' governmentproclaimed by seven rebel factions based in Pakistan.   Hekmatyar's group has received a major portion of millions ofdollars worth of military aid supplied by the United States andchanneled through Pakistan.   Hekmatyar, who holds the title of foreign minister in the6-month-old interim government, indicated he would boycott thealliance if elections aren't held by Aug. 10.   He said elections throughout war-ravaged Afghanistan and inrefugee camps in Pakistan were essential to stop internal fightingamong the rebel factions.   ``It (elections) would kill the tendency toward armed clashes,''he said. ``This is the only way of putting an end to our problems.''   Guerrilla leaders formed the interim government during a seriesof meetings in February in the Pakistani capital of Islamabad.   Hekmatyar joined with the condition that it hold electionswithin six months.   ``Elections would include other parties, provide a legitimatebody to draw up a constitution, dispense with tribal prejudices andprevent internal fighting,'' Hekmatyar said through an interpreter.   He called on Afghan army units to stage a coup with the rebels'help and set up a ``revolutionary council'' to oversee nationwideelections.   It appeared that Hekmatyar made the proposals to try to countergrowing criticism. He and his party have been accused by otherrebel groups of seeking to dominate the alliance.   Marxist army officers seized power in Afghanistan in a 1978coup. The Soviets ended more than nine years of militaryintervention to help the government when it completed thewithdrawal of troops on Feb. 15.   The Kremlin continues to back the government with military andeconomic aid.</TEXT></DOC>
