Also today, at least eight rockets slammed into Kabul, killing atleast five people, said an official of the Soviet-backed government.   Two rockets hit a residential area 1,000 yards from theContinental Hotel in northwestern Kabul, where most visitingforeigners, including journalists, live. There were no immediatereports of casualties near the hotel.   Diplomatic sources and witnesses said the dawn air strikes on theguerrilla positions near Kabul were the most intensive in weeks, butthere was no immediate report of casualties.   The Supreme Defense Council, reporting the bombings aroundJalalabad, said its forces ``were combatting with high morale andinflicting retaliatory blows'' to defend the city, which has beenunder guerrilla siege since March 7.   The statement gave no word on casualties.   The government official, who demanded anonymity, said the airforce and artillery units battled the U.S.-backed guerrillasJalalabad.   The city is 75 miles east of the capital and 45 miles west of theborder with Pakistan, where many of the guerrillas are based.   The fighter-bombers were seen flying off from Kabul and nearbyBaghram air base in formations of two and three for the PaghmanMountains northwest of the capital. The mountains serve as asanctuary for resistance fighters.   Thirty to 35 planes took part in an operation that began at dawnand continued for 90 minutes, witnesses said.   Afghan government officials were not available for immediatecomment.   Some of the aircraft headed for the eastern province ofNangarhar, where the guerrillas launched their first major attacksthree weeks after the Soviet Union completed its troop withdrawalfrom Afghanistan on Feb. 15.   Jalalabad, scene of fierce battles between the resistance andgovernment troops, is the capital Nangarhar and the country's fifthlargest city.   It is considered of strategic importance because of its proximityto Pakistan, where the most powerful guerrilla groups are based.   The government claims it broke the rebel siege on Jalalabad lastmonth, but official Kabul Radio has reported fighting around thecity for the past two weeks. The radio said guerrillas on Tuesdayfired artillery and rockets into residential areas of Jalalabad,killing four people, including two children, and wounding eight,including two soldiers.   The government said Tuesday that Moslem rebels were planningsimultaneous ``massive attacks'' on Kabul and other major cities,and asked the United Nations to intervene to stop the ``impendingbloodbath.''   In a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar,Foreign Minister Abdul Wakil said the guerrillas were planning tolaunch the assault in mid-July.   Wakil said the rebels were being aided in their planned attack byU.S. and Pakistani army officers. He did not elaborate.   ``The grave consequences (of the attack) which will includebloodshed, killings and destruction, will be shouldered by thePakistani militarists and overseas designers of the attack,'' Wakilsaid in a statement Tuesday.   The ruling People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan seized powerin an April 1978 coup. In December 1979, the Soviet Union intervenedto prop up the Marxist regime.   Soviet troops left Afghanistan after a U.N.-mediated accord.</TEXT></DOC>
