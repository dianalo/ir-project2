His first son was born three months ago with congenital asplenia syndrome, a condition characterized by four heart chambers functioning as two, and no spleen.    &quot;His little heart isn't capable of giving oxygen to all his muscles,&quot; the mayor says softly. &quot;I don't know how long we're going to have him.&quot;    The poignant sight of the 40-year-old mayor wiping away tears adds another dimension to his carefully cultivated image of indefatigability and stamina. And this is no act. Amid this family crisis, Henry Cisneros has interrupted one of the fastest-rising careers in Democratic Party politics.    Mr. Cisneros stunned his party last month, and ended widespread speculation, by announcing he wouldn't seek to challenge Gov. Bill Clements in 1990 or seek any other statewide office that year. Instead, Mr. Cisneros will stay close to the hearth, completing unfinished projects in the nation's 10th-largest city, which elected him the first Mexican-American mayor of a major U.S. city in 1981, when he was but 33 years old.    &quot;He's all dressed up and nowhere to go,&quot; says City Councilwoman Helen Dutmer.    But Mr. Cisneros may only have postponed -- or eliminated altogether -- a stepping stone on the way to national political office. Walter Mondale, after all, considered him as a running mate in the 1984 election. &quot;If I had been elected,&quot; Mr. Mondale now says, &quot;I would have chosen him for a cabinet position.&quot; Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas), calls him &quot;one of the real stars in our party -- not just in Texas but nationally,&quot; and a probable contender for a cabinet post in any Democratic White House.    Robert Strauss, former Democratic National Committee chairman, is prepared to throw his considerable weight behind Mr. Cisneros no matter what office he seeks. &quot;I'll support him, period,&quot; Mr. Strauss says.    Mr. Cisneros's near-perfect track record as mayor -- and his distinction as the brightest political leader among Hispanics, the fastest-growing segment of the party -- makes the other side jealous. &quot;I wish he were a Republican,&quot; says Miguel H. Martinez, director of Hispanic operations for the 1984 Reagan-Bush campaign. &quot;He's been a damn good public servant.&quot;    For now, though, the Harvard-educated Mr. Cisneros is contenting himself with his family and his city -- and when the subject turns to San Antonio, the boyish-looking former career Army officer sheds his melancholy. &quot;I can't imagine anything as fulfilling and challenging as being mayor of San Antonio,&quot; he says. And indeed, while gliding through his city in the front seat of a chauffeur-driven limousine, Mr. Cisneros displays the showmanship of a big-city mayor on the stump.    &quot;How's your neck?&quot; he shouts to a perfect stranger in a neck brace. Fiddling with the radio dial, he stops at a Top 40 station playing an upbeat Janet Jackson song and drums his fingers on the dashboard. Between choruses he ticks off the city's big events: visits this month by Pope John Paul II and King Juan Carlos of Spain, as well as a Grand Prix auto race held last weekend.    &quot;There's going to be thunder in the streets,&quot; he shouted a week before the race, as if envisioning the speeding cars. &quot;The vibrations will just shake your guts!&quot;    Flashy municipal projects count in San Antonio, a city best noted for its tourist attractions and unassailable hospitality. In his six years as mayor, Mr. Cisneros has cultivated several non-tourism enterprises, such as a fledgling biotechnology industry that is far ahead of what cities elsewhere are planning.    Although economic expansion has passed over many areas, it was sufficient to draw an additional 181,000 people to Bexar County in the first half of the decade, making it the 10th-fastest growing county in the nation, according to the Census Bureau. And many view San Antonio, with its 53% Hispanic population, as a model of peaceful race relations for other cities in which minorities will become the majority in years ahead.    &quot;Mayor Cisneros has a sound and pragmatic approach to urban economic and social issues,&quot; says Paul Kirk, chairman of the Democratic National Committee. &quot;He is certain to play an important role in the nation's urban policy.&quot;    But the city's reputation for hospitality remains its greatest strength, and one that Mr. Cisneros has spared little in expanding. Two hundred street improvements are under way, along with the construction of a new downtown hotel, a giant Sea World theme park and a shopping mall with a stream running through the middle. While most of oil-dependant Texas languishes, this is &quot;the largest volume of construction in the city's history,&quot; he says.    Not content with a street-level tour, the one-man public-relations firm grabs a cellular phone and secures a helicopter. &quot;How's the little one?&quot; a pilot inquires, and again the mayor -- also the father of two daughters, aged 12 and 16 -- reports on the infant's condition. From 200 feet above the city, the controversies surrounding some of the mayor's projects are hardly visible: there is the papal Mass site, suitable for 125,000 but expected to draw 500,000, and the cramped site of a proposed sports stadium that the mayor wants to use to draw a big-league professional sports team.    His hair tousled from the windy helicopter tour, the city's top gun tears off the headset he'd worn to make himself heard above the noise of the flight. &quot;Man, we've got a lot going on,&quot; he exclaims, his fists clenched. &quot;Man, it's exciting.&quot;    Mr. Cisneros's improvements, carefully packaged as &quot;Target '90: Goals for San Antonio&quot; and named for the year of their scheduled completion, have come at a cost -- a heavy one, in terms of local taxes. For example, total budget costs have risen nearly 72% to $620.1 million in 1986-87 from $361.1 million during the mayor's first term in 1981-82. In addition, revenue collected through property, utility and sewer taxes has increased 60% to an estimated $280 million in 1987-88 from $175 million in 1984. His critics claim the mayor has accomplished little except to gussy up an already pretty city. &quot;It's all media hype,&quot; says C.A. Stubbs, president of the city's Homeowners Taxpayers Association. &quot;He's got the best image-builders money can buy.&quot;    The mayor's emotion-prone leadership has caused him embarrassment, such as when he called an opponent on the city council a &quot;prince of destruction&quot; and accused him of recruiting a &quot;goon squad&quot; to harass his family; Mr. Cisneros later apologized. And at the polls, the mayor lately has proved somewhat less beloved than earlier: In April he was re-elected with 67% of the vote, a stunning figure, but not quite the 94% he drew in his first defense of his office in 1983.    But the opposition was hardly evident during a recent Spanish Mass at San Fernando Cathedral, where the Rev. Virgilio Elizondo devoted a large part of the Sunday sermon to the mayor's decision against seeking statewide office. Mr. Cisneros is a member of the church, which is the largest Hispanic parish in the city. Father Elizondo urged parishioners to sign a letter of support he had drafted -- &quot;not a political endorsement,&quot; the priest assured his parishioners. &quot;It's just a way of saying 'Henry, we're with you.'&quot;    &quot;As a Christian, as an American and as an Hispanic, we are most proud of your decision,&quot; the letter said. At last count, 1,500 parishioners had signed. </TEXT></DOC>
