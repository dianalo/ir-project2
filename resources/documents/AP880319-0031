As Nicaraguan troops on Friday battled the U.S.-suppliedguerrillas in a region bordering Honduras, the leftist governmentsaid it still desires to hold peace talks with the U.S.-backedrebels next week.   Government radio warned listeners of ``American imperialism andthe threat of military intervention.'' And a headline in Barricada,the Sandinista newspaper, said: ``The Order Of The Day: IntensifyCombat.''   The radio also condemned border air raids by Honduras, which itsaid struck inside Nicaragua. Honduras said the raids Thursday wereconfined to Sandinista forces that had crossed into Honduranterritory.   Honduras and the United States contend Sandinista troops enteredHonduras in the rugged jungle region in pursuit of Contras.Officially, the Sandinistas deny this. But privately, a Nicaraguanmilitary official indicated Friday that an incursion had occurred.   Honduran military officials said 1,000 Sandinista soldiersremained in their territory on Friday.   In Managua, the Defense Ministry said 17 soldiers and 15 rebelswere killed between Tuesday and Friday in fighting in the centralprovince of Matagalpa, in Zelaya on the Caribbean coast andJinotega, along the Honduran border.   Civilian sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity forsecurity reasons, said 17 soldiers were killed and eight wounded intwo clashes Friday in the central province of Chontales. Six rebelswere killed, they said.   Lt. Col. Javier Carrion, who led the Sandinista offensive, toldreporters Thursday at the border outpost of San Andres de Bocaythat 4,500 Sandinista soldiers backed by bombers and helicoptergunships were involved in the campaign that began March 8 and drovehundreds of Contras back into Honduras, where they have base camps.   Carrion said Sandinista troops killed 92 Contras and wounded300, at the cost of 34 soldiers dead and 68 wounded.   He said the purpose was to destroy Contra bases in the borderarea, about 40 miles from an important mining region the rebelsattacked in December.   On Thursday and Friday, the United States flew in 3,200 soldiersof the 82nd Airborne Division and 7th Light Infantry to Honduras inwhat the white house called a ``measured response'' to the allegedNicaraguan incursion.   President Daniel Ortega said Nicaraguan troops would take on theAmericans if necessary.   His government, meanwhile, insisted it was going ahead withplans for cease-fire talks with the Contras in Nicaraguan territoryon the Costa Rican border Monday. The rebels said they wouldboycott the talks unless the Sandinistas pull out of Honduras.   Cease-fires in the region's civil wars, and a ban on the use ofone country's territory for attacks on another, are provisions ofthe regional peace plan signed Aug. 7 by the five Central Americanpresidents.   The plan also calls for an end to outside aid to insurgents.   In Washington, a bi-partisan group of senators proposed a $48million package of new aid to the Contras, including renewedauthority for the CIA to deliver previously stockpiled weapons.   On Feb. 3, President Reagan narrowly lost a House vote oncontinuing Contra aid. A Democratic alternative was defeated, 216to 208, a month later.</TEXT></DOC>
