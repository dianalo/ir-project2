Bush, 35, a Miami real estate developer, stopped with his son inSpitak, which was destroyed by the earthquake Dec. 7.   ``We'd seen it on television every night, but to be there isdifferent, I think more profound,'' he said. ``We take for granted avery good life.''   ``It was very sad to see these kids my age'' in the hospital,said his son. He said he thought they ``were happy to get presentsfrom a person from across the world.''   The younger Bush said he hadn't minded spending his Christmasaway from home. ``Many people think Christmas Day is a day when youopen presents. But it's to celebrate Jesus' birth,'' he said. ``Ihad the Christmas spirit.''   Their flight was organized by Americares, a relief organizationin New Canaan, Conn.
