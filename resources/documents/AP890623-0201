Tom Forrest says, there is no room for small thinking.   So the Brooklyn-born Roman Catholic preacher thinks big.   He is the driving force behind Lumen 2000, a controversial groupthat wants to give the Roman Catholic Church its own form of``televangelism'' _ on a world scale.   Since its founding in 1986, Lumen has set up media schools,produced a popular soap opera and distributed scores of TV and videoprograms to Africa, Latin America and Asia.   But critics, particularly in Latin America, charge Lumen 2000 isa conservative arm of the Vatican, threatening to supplant localinitiatives.   ``They think we're going to go in like the big ugly American andtake over,'' said an official at Lumen's office in Rome, the Rev.Jim Bermingham.   With the tacit approval of the pope, Lumen is aiming to be aprivate-sector answer to one of the Vatican's dearest wishes: toharness television to spread the faith.   ``The Catholic Church is backward in television communications,''said Forrest, a wiry, 61-year-old former missionary who headsEvangelization 2000, the umbrella organization that includes Lumen.   ``TV is not only the best means of communication today, it's themost expensive ... and the most requiring of utter professionalism.''   In 1987, Lumen co-sponsored a satellite hook-up through whichPope John Paul II led Catholics on five continents in prayer.   Lumen _ the name comes word meaning a measure of the flow oflight _ differs from Protestant ``televangelists'' such as PatRobertson or Jimmy Swaggart in providing a variety of programs withfew dominant personalities.   Its Dallas-based film library offers Catholic groups around theworld a choice of footage and more than 1,000 inspirationalprograms, many donated by such Catholic media groups as the NewYork-based Christophers or Mother Angelica, a nun who runs a cablenetwork in Birmingham, Ala.   Lumen also donates equipment and trains Third World TVjournalists at its centers in Dallas and Bogota, Colombia.   But Lumen's ultimate aim is to establish Christian entertainmentgood enough to compete with top-run programs on regular television.   ``I think we could do programming _ all visuals, not just talkingheads,'' Forrest said in an interview. ``I believe we have veryexciting answers.''   Lumen produced its first entertainment program last year, aminiseries about a Latin American priest. ``Semilla de Mostaza''(Mustard Seed) was popular enough to get commercial sponsorship onColombian television. Lumen has another series in the works.   Lumen's other major program, a TV ``newsmagazine'' about thechurch intended for use worldwide, will be ready early next year.   Lumen has been influenced by its founders' membership in theCatholic ``charismatic'' movement, which emphasizes personalspirituality and spreading the faith.   Those goals have brought the group into conflict with anothermovement in the church _ liberation theology.   Liberation theology, which has flourished in Latin America,although the Vatican rejects parts of it, stresses activism onbehalf of the oppressed and encourages a local focus.   Some of its proponents accuse Lumen leaders of being ``spiritualcolonialists'' for their worldwide ambitions and emphasis on thechurch hierarchy.   ``Lumen 2000 is evidence of the success of the theology ofliberation and of the fear and anger it arouses in conservativegroups,'' said Jose Queiroz, a theologian who coordinates thereligious studies post-graduate program at Catholic University inSao Paulo, Brazil.   Bishop Tomas Balduino, a leading progressive based in theBrazilian state of Goias, recently was quoted by the Jornal doBrasil newspaper in Rio de Janeiro as saying Evangelization 2000``is an illegitimate and nefarious project trying to enter throughthe back door without asking the Brazilian bishops' permission.''   Lumen leaders say they follow the guidelines of the Vatican,which opposes the forms of liberation theology that stress Marxistprinciples.   They brush the criticism aside.   ``It has been quite extraordinary to see, because of theincredible fantasies,'' Forrest said. ``Like I'm supposed to have$400 million. They have us getting money from the CIA.''   Lumen gets most of its money from a foundation created by PietDirksen, a Dutch millionaire and charismatic who is Lumen'spresident.   Lumen has had its greatest growth in Latin America, despite thecriticism that emanates from there. It focuses on the Third World,where the church is expanding and television time is often availableto religious groups for little cost.   Church officials stress, however, that Lumen is not a Vaticanproject.   ``It's a private initiative with a very commendable purpose,which is to spread the word of God through the communicationsmedia,'' said the president of the Vatican's Commission on SocialCommunications, Archbishop John Foley, an American with a degreefrom Columbia Journalism School.   In a recent speech, Pope Paul said: ``The question confrontingthe church today is not any longer whether the man in the street cangrasp a religious message, but how to employ the communicationsmedia so as to let him have the full impact of the Gospel message.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Wed PMs June 28</NOTE></DOC>
