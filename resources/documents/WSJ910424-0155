In an interview during a visit here to confer with U.S.officials, the director general, Hans Blix, stressed that thewhereabouts of the fuel, which contains enough enricheduranium for at least one nuclear weapon, must be disclosed&quot;very, very shortly&quot; so his agency can remove it from Iraq.</LP><TEXT>   If Iraq fails to respond, he said, the IAEA will reportthe matter to the United Nations Security Council, where aspecial commission is forming to oversee the removal ordestruction of Iraq's nuclear materials and its machineryrelated to missiles or chemical and biological weapons.Earlier, Iraq disclosed that it has the nuclear fuel, butfailed to say where it is.   The highly enriched uranium fuel, which may be under therubble of two nuclear facilities bombed by the U.S. atTuwaitha, about 15 miles from Baghdad, is only the first itemon the IAEA's inspection agenda, said Mr. Blix.   He said the agency also will hunt for bomb-designlaboratories or uranium-enrichment facilities that could berelated to a nuclear weapons program. The IAEA, he said, willrely heavily on expertise and intelligence from the U.S. andother major powers to locate the facilities, if Iraq doesn'tcooperate.   Meanwhile, according to a U.N. diplomat, members of theSecurity Council have complained privately to Baghdad that aletter it was required to send to the U.N. last week, whichidentified large chemical weapons stocks, was incompletebecause it failed to list Iraq's biological weapons program.   Under the cease-fire agreement it signed on April 3, Iraqpromised to identify the amounts and locations of all of itsweapons of mass destruction. The job of finding and removingor destroying them will be overseen by the special U.N.commission and the IAEA, a separately funded organizationthat has expertise in inspecting nuclear facilities.   On Monday, U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellarnamed Rolf Ekeus, a Swedish arms control expert, to head thecommission. He will be assisted by Robert L. Gallucci, aprofessor at the U.S. National War College at Carlisle, Pa.   Iraq's nuclear-bomb program could include laboratoriescontaining weapons designs, electronic trigger mechanisms andperhaps even mockups of a bomb, according to Leonard Spector,a nuclear weapons proliferation expert at the CarnegieEndowment for International Peace in Washington.</TEXT></DOC>
