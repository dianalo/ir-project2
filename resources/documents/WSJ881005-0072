But that was about all the activity there was in financial markets. Major stock indexes finished with very slight declines, while bonds closed at almost exactly the same levels as Monday. Most short-term interest rates also hardly budged, and the dollar was little changed.    &quot;If you'd hooked up the financial markets to a hospital monitor, the reading would be brain-dead. They're all flat,&quot; said Jeffrey Applegate, chief investment strategist at Tucker, Anthony andamp; R.L. Day Inc. &quot;I felt like I had to wake up some of our traders. They were just staring at their monitors.&quot;    Investors paid little attention to a slight rise in some oil prices yesterday. Analysts noted that oil prices later came down slightly from their highs for the day, and that many traders still expect further declines because of a perception that world oil markets remain glutted.    The main focus of attention was Grand Metropolitan's takeover bid for Pillsbury Co. About 16.5 million shares of Pillsbury traded yesterday, and it jumped $18 to $57 a share. The bid also renewed investors' hopes that other stocks might be struck by takeover lightning.    &quot;It's casino time right now,&quot; said Jon Groveman, head of equity trading at Ladenburg, Thalmann andamp; Co. &quot;The Pillsbury bid ignited all the story stocks.&quot; Besides food stocks, other stocks that rallied were Time Inc., DeSoto, and Pennwalt.    In major market action yesterday:   Stocks held steady throughout the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 3.20 points at 2102.06. The broader market was just about as lifeless. Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index declined 0.76 to 270.62, while the New York Stock Exchange composite index slipped 0.30 to 152.93.    Volume perked up on the Big Board from Monday, totaling 157.8 million shares. But much of the additional turnover was accounted for by stocks rumored to be for sale.    Bond prices were flat. The yield on the benchmark 30-year government bonds finished unchanged at 8.95%.    One big question mark hanging over the bond markets is whether the Treasury will sell new 30-year bonds in November, as it usually does. George Gould, the Treasury's undersecretary for finance, said he can't answer this yet because of uncertainty about when Congress will increase the government's long-term bond issuance authority. If Congress acts soon and the Treasury can sell the new bonds, the large new supply could drive down bond prices, several traders said. But many said there are growing signs that Congress might not act until next year.    The dollar finished mixed. In late New York trading, the dollar rose to 1.8649 marks from 1.8615 Monday, and fell to 133.38 yen from 133.68. The dollar didn't react to another prediction by Martin Feldstein, former chairman of President Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers, that it will drop further. Mr. Feldstein, speaking at a conference in New York, said the dollar still is 10% to 20% too high to help reduce the U.S. trade deficit significantly.    Mr. Feldstein, now a Harvard professor, said the recent dollar rise &quot;is an aberration&quot; and that investors are &quot;misreading&quot; the U.S. trade figures. If the dollar stays about where it is, he contended, &quot;The trade deficit will remain.&quot;    Several similar forecasts in the past by Mr. Feldstein have contributed to sharp declines in the dollar, which in turn has dragged down bond prices. But investors yesterday greeted the economist's latest forecasts with a yawn.    One reason for investors' inattention to Mr. Feldstein is that Reagan administration officials have indicated they want the dollar to hold steady. They fear a lower dollar would discourage foreign investors from buying dollar-denominated securities, such as Treasury bonds, leading to higher interest rates. </TEXT></DOC>
