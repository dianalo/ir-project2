 Today, theycan have the best of both.andM;Current Windows-based 3270 terminal-emulation programs supportindustry-standard hardware: 3270 coax board connections, Synchronous DataLink Control modem links and direct LAN connections through IBM's Token-RingInterface Connector.andP;  On the software side, many commercial products use thestandard 3270 PC-to-mainframe software application program interfaces such asHigh-Level Language Application Programming Interface (HLLAPI), an interfacebetween high-level languages, and Application Program-to-ProgramCommunications (APPC), which provides communication between programs.andM;Companies using Windows-based 3270 terminal emulation often find that thegraphical user interface improves productivity, with further boosts fromWindows' Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) for data sharing between PC andmainframe applications.andP;  Even so, users and in-house developers remainconcerned about the difficulty of staying compatible with industry standards,as well as the costs of porting the PC portions of existing applications fromDOS to the Windows environment.andM;There is much to like in a Windows-based 3270 emulation.andP;  Character-based DOS3270 PC emulation programs are well-suited to running single mainframesessions, but toggling between mainframe and local applications typicallyrequires a user to page through full-screen displays.andP;  Multiple windows aredisplayed, but only one window provides a complete view of the session behindit.andM;This is no problem if a user is working with one session at a time, but it isawkward to have to switch between applications in multiple host sessions.andP;  Bycontrast, Windows-based 3270 terminal emulators can display concurrent 3270sessions in separate, resizable windows.andP;  This makes it easier to monitorremote sessions while working with local PC applications.andM;Most users rarely require more than two or three concurrent 3270 sessions,but Windows-based emulation programs such as Attachmate Corp.'s Extra forWindows, Digital Communications Associates Inc.'s (DCA's) Workstation forWindows, Wall Data Inc.'s Rumba and IBM's recently announced PersonalCommunications/3270 version 2.0 support four or more DFT coax connections.andM;Windows-based 3270 communications programs also support Windows' Clipboardand DDE to enable users to build ad hoc or permanent links between mainframeand PC applications.andP;  Various 3270 terminal-emulation software developershave differentiated their products by providing enhanced DDE capabilities.andM;Rumba, for example, supports &quot;hot links,&quot; which let users update data thathas been downloaded from a host into a Windows application, and &quot;hot spots,&quot;which allow users to execute mainframe functions or previously created macrosby clicking on corresponding host menu items.andM;Attachmate's recently released Extra version 3.2 offers DDE capabilities suchas a &quot;host-aware&quot; feature, which lets users work with mainframe data withoutever seeing mainframe screens or learning mainframe commands.andM;Windows-based 3270 emulation programs also use dynamic link libraries--segments of code that can be shared by several applications and loaded onlyas needed, thereby freeing up both memory and disk space.andM;Different 3270 applications' keyboard commands can be mapped to Windows'graphical interface, replacing cumbersome memorized keystrokes withmouse-selected icons or hot spots on a host application's screen.andP;  This makesit much easier for users to move to non-3270 standard keyboards and greatlyreduces application support requirements.andM;Some companies that have adopted Windows for office-productivity applicationshave not moved to Windows-based 3270 emulation because of the effort neededto port existing DOS-based PC-to-mainframe applications.andM;Developers can choose between two primary methods of creating PC-to-mainframeapplications: HLLAPI, for high-level languages, and APPC.andP;  Both supportcharacter-based DOS applications.andM;HLLAPI is a programming interface between a PC application, written in ahigh-level computer language such as COBOL, Pascal or C, and the presentationspace of a 3270 terminal-emulation screen.andP;  HLLAPI makes a remote mainframetask appear to the user as a local PC operation.andM;APPC is based on IBM's LU 6.2 protocols, which enable different hardwaredevices to communicate in a cross-platform environment.andP;  APPC is IBM's choicefor program-to-program communication under the Systems Network Architecture(SNA), but HLLAPI is still much more widely used for PC-to-mainframeconnectivity.andM;HLLAPI and EHLLAPI (Emulator HLLAPI, a subset of HLLAPI developed by IBM tosupport DOS and OS/2 connectivity products) are neither as efficient nor ascapable as APPC, but they are easier to implement and do not requireprogramming at the host.andM;DCA's Workstation for Windows is the only Windows-based 3270terminal-emulation product that supports APPC, making it a robust platformfor new PC-to-mainframe applications.andP;  LU 6.2 enables multiple hostapplications to communicate with multiple PC applications through a single3270 connection and requires less overhead than HLLAPI's terminal protocol.andO;LU 6.2 also supports Node Type 2.1 intelligent workstations or minicomputersthat can handle peer-to-peer networking.andM;APPC-compliant third-party Windows applications, such as databaseapplications from Gupta Technologies Inc. and Micro Decisionware Inc.,andO;provide better performance using LU 6.2 than HLLAPI.andM;Both HLLAPI and APPC provide reliable interface standards for PC-to-mainframeconnectivity, but most analysts believe that APPC will become moresignificant over the next few years as more applications take advantage ofAPPC's peer-to-peer architecture.andP;  In the meantime, most developers continueto rely on EHLLAPI.andP;  However, Windows 3270 communications programs do notwork reliably with EHLLAPI or APPC programs designed for DOS.andM;Attachmate's Extra, however, can run programs that support DOS EHLLAPI inWindows without modification by providing a &quot;redirector&quot; that traps DOSEHLLAPI function calls and passes them to the appropriate Windows calls inExtra.andM;DCA has also made Workstation for Windows' HLLAPI script language compatiblewith IBM's OS/2 Presentation Manager version of EHLLAPI.andP;  This makes iteasier for programmers who are familiar with OS/2 EHLLAPI calls to modifytheir scripts to support the Windows environment.andM;IBM's Personal Communications/3270 version 2.0 provides host connection andgateway services for both DOS and Windows applications based on the company'sown OS/2 3270 terminal-emulation product.andP;  IBM also provides an Auto3270 modefor PCs used as dedicated 3270-dependent displays with SNA or non-SNACoax/DFT host connections.andP;  But DOS applications must be modified to supportIBM's Windows mode.andM;Companies planning to migrate PC-to-mainframe applications into the Windowsenvironment must decide whether to adopt Attachmate's &quot;pass-through&quot; solutionfor DOS EHLLAPI applications, to port their DOS applications to the Windowsenvironment or to reprogram their DOS applications to support APPC.andM;--------------------Doug Dayton is president of Dayton Associates, a consulting firm in Bellevue,Wash.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
