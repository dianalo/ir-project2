Barnett Banks of Florida Inc. and United First Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association of Sarasota, Fla., are challenging the rule, which requires any federally insured thrift to obtain Bank Board approval before converting to a bank. Oral arguments before a three-judge panel of the federal appeals court here were held this week, and a decision is expected in about a month.    The rule, which was quietly passed by the Bank Board last October without public hearing or comment, is designed to keep healthy thrifts in the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., the insurance system, by making it very expensive for them to leave. Using the rule, the Bank Board has begun extracting from departing thrifts substantial &quot;exit fees&quot; -- high multiples of the thrifts' annual FSLIC premiums.    If the rule is struck down, it could prompt an exodus of institutions from the FSLIC, which is financially strained and is asking Congress to approve a recapitalization plan. But a narrow ruling, saying simply that the rule was improperly adopted, would leave the issue of the Bank Board's authority to adopt the rule clouded.    The Bank Board, saying the litigation has had a &quot;chilling effect&quot; on its ability to levy the exit fees, has asked Congress to clarify and expand its powers to charge them.    Thrifts have recently become popular acquisition targets for commercial banks, which generally convert them into banks that are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.    Bank Board officials worry that if too many healthy thrifts bolt from the FSLIC, leaving behind the weaker institutions, it will exacerbate the insurance fund's problems and dim prospects of a successful recapitalization plan.    Thrift officials generally regard the rule as onerous and unfair. &quot;The new rule is an attempt to erect a 'Berlin wall' around the FSLIC system in an effort to keep healthy thrifts in the system,&quot; the National Council of Savings Institutions, a trade group, said in a brief filed in the pending case.    The court challenge began last fall, months after Barnett, based in Jacksonville, Fla., had announced plans to acquire United First and convert it first to a state-chartered thrift and then to an FDIC-insured commercial bank. The Bank Board asserted its approval was needed before the conversion could be done.    Based on other recent transactions approved by the Bank Board and on conversations with Bank Board staff, Barnett and United First said they anticipated the thrift would have to pay an exit fee of about $17 million.    The institutions balked and filed suit in Jacksonville in November, seeking to have the Bank Board rule declared invalid.    In December, U.S. District Court Judge John H. Moore II in Jacksonville sided with the institutions, calling the Bank Board's actions &quot;extortion&quot; and &quot;the most high-handed, arbitrary, bureaucratic thing that's ever happened in this country.&quot; He issued a preliminary injunction blocking the Bank Board from interfering with the acquisition, which was promptly completed.    The Bank Board, which has been hammered recently by a series of legal defeats, appealed that decision. Meanwhile, in February the Bank Board also refiled the rule, following the proper procedures for public notice and comment that it had bypassed before.    So far, a proposal made in January by Bank Board Chairman Edwin Gray to clarify and strengthen the Bank Board's authority to charge exit fees hasn't been incorporated into the legislation proposed for recapitalizing FSLIC.    Industry officials believe a defeat for the Bank Board in the appellate court could give the agency leverage in getting Congress to act on the exit-fee issue. &quot;The FSLIC can say the sky is falling and it's getting lower,&quot; says Wendy Samuel, an attorney for the National Council of Savings Institutions. </TEXT></DOC>
