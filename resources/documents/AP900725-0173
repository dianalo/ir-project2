Talks began Friday and were to end Tuesday. When the two sidesgot nowhere on the issue of reforming the military, however,negotiators decided to move on to human rights in an attempt tomake some tangible progress.   The main objective of the talks is to reach a cease-fire in thedecade-long civil war that has killed 72,000 people in the smallCentral American country.   Oscar Santamaria, the justice minister and chief of thegovernment delegation, said both sides are agreeable to U.N. humanrights monitoring.   ``The position of the government is that there will be a stateinstitution that supervises human rights and that it will bemonitored by the United Nations,'' Santamaria told The AssociatedPress.   However, the rebel Farabundo Marti National Liberation Frontwants the human rights commission to be run by the United Nations.   ``Our position is that it should be a U.N. mission that overseeshuman rights, because if it's the government's, that will take awayits effectiveness,'' rebel negotiator Schafik Handal, the seniorguerrilla commander, told the AP.   In El Salvador, rebels took over a small, rural community toexplain to residents the status of the talks in Costa Rica.   ``A man who looked like a peasant, with his M-16 on hisshoulder, told us that if there are no concrete agreements theywill launch another offensive on the capital, which could be worsethan the one on Nov. 11,'' said Jaime Tejada, a resident of SanFrancisco Morazan, 45 miles north of the capital, San Salvador.   The guerrillas talked of such an offensive before thediscussions began to pressure the government to negotiate changesin the military.   The November offensive was the largest in the history of thewar, claiming 2,000 lives.   This is the third round of talks this year aimed at ending theshooting.</TEXT></DOC>
