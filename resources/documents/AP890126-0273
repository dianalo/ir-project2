The historic loss was no surprise to shareholders _ ATandamp;T forecastit last month _ but it nevertheless signaled the growing urgency ofcompetition in the long-distance phone business.   ATandamp;T took a $6.72 billion pre-tax charge in the fourth quarter of1988 to cover costs of accelerating its transition to digitaltechnology, which uses the language of computers to send voices anddata over fiber-optic lines.   The company is scrapping outdated analog phone equipment andmoving, retiring or laying off 16,000 employees.   ATandamp;T's stock was unchanged at $30.87{ in late afternoon tradingon the New York Stock Exchange Thursday, reflecting investors'unconcern. The write-off has no effect on ATandamp;T's cash flow, abilityto pay dividends or money available for investment.   ATandamp;T lost $3.34 billion in the quarter ended Dec. 31 and $1.67billion in all of 1988.   ``You say, `My gosh, what a huge charge.' But when it's ATandamp;T andit's such a large company, people just brush it off and look aheadto the next quarter,'' said Audrey Stevoff, an analyst at Duff andamp;Phelps Inc. in Chicago.   ATandamp;T was forced to speed up its introduction of digital servicesto meet the competition from MCI Communications Corp. and US SprintCommunications Co., which have been steadily taking away itscustomers.   The fight is most ferocious for Fortune 100 accounts, the giantssuch as General Electric Co., Ford Motor Co. and Du Pont Co. thathave phone bills of millions of dollars a month.   ATandamp;T, the only long-distance company with regulated rates,complains that federal regulation is preventing it from respondingflexibly to special offers by unregulated MCI and US Sprint.   ``I'm getting my clock cleaned,'' Joseph P. Nacchio, an ATandamp;T vicepresident who appears in commercials, complained to reporters thismonth in Washington, according to a trade publication, Report onATandamp;T. ``I'm losing (customers) faster than I can count them rightnow.''   Responding to the threat, ATandamp;T is pushing hard for regulatoryreform in Washington and has redeployed thousands of people intosales jobs. Meanwhile, its money-losing computer business got a bigboost from a $1 billion Air Force contract last year.   Executives of GE, Ford and Du Pont, all major customers of ATandamp;T,said in interviews Thursday that they consider themselves bigwinners from the cutthroat battle for their business.   With new services, higher quality and lower prices, ``corporateAmerica has really benefited by what really is almost entirely dueto competition,'' said Stan Welland, GE's manager of corporatetelecommunications.   Du Pont uses high-volume data ``pipes'' to carry traffic betweena research center in Victoria, Texas, and a supercomputer at itsWilmington, Del., headquarters.   Ford keeps in touch with dealerships via phone links to computerterminals in the dealers' finance and service areas.   ``Telecommunications is an area that 10 years ago was somewhat ofa backwater. ATandamp;T took care of that for you. Today's it's anessential part of the technical infrastructure,'' said S.I. Gilman,Ford's executive director of information systems.   Most residential customers and small businesses also arebenefiting from the competition, but not as much. They don't use newservices such as video conferencing. Also, higher local chargesoffset the drop in long-distance rates for people who don't makemany long-distance calls.   ATandamp;T pointed out that in spite of its loss from the one-timecharge, its revenue in the fourth quarter and full year were thehighest since the Bell System breakup five years ago.   Without the charge, earnings would have risen 19 percent in thequarter and 11 percent for the full year.   ``The charge for network modernization, despite its effect onshort-term results, was driven by our determination to continuewinning customers in the marketplace,'' ATandamp;T Chairman Robert E.Allen said in a statement. ``Underlying this action are clearindications that 1988 was a year of steady improvement in ouroperations.''   ATandamp;T's $3.34 billion fourth-quarter net loss compared withprofits of $498 million, or 46 cents a share, a year earlier.Revenue rose to $9.21 billion from $8.65 billion a year earlier.   For the full year, the $1.67 billion loss compared to a profit of$2.04 billion, or $1.88 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to$35.2 billion from $33.8 billion.   ATandamp;T faces talks in April with the Communication Workers ofAmerica, which represents 135,000 employees. Union spokeswoman GayeWilliams Mack said Thursday the company is cutting hourly workers,``but they're not cutting the fat out of management.''   MCI and US Sprint are not organized by the union.</TEXT></DOC>
