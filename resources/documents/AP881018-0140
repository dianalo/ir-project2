PatSwindall, who was indicted on perjury charges this week, is one ofthe few who also is in trouble with the voters.   Republican Swindall is trailing his Democratic challenger, BenJones, by 51 percent to 33 percent in their suburban Atlantadistrict, according to an Oct. 13-14 poll cited by the DemocraticCongressional Campaign Committee.   By contrast, Rep. Harold Ford, D-Tenn., indicted April 24, 1987,on bank fraud, mail fraud and conspiracy charges and still awaitingtrial, has only token opposition in his bid for an eighth Houseterm from Memphis.   Many lawmakers who have been investigated by the House ethicscommittee have encountered little challenge _ or none at all _ inseeking re-election.   Swindall also is unusual because he is the lone Republican in asea of problem-plagued Democrats, a circumstance the Democraticcommittee attributes to politically motivated complaints of ethicsviolations.   ``Most of these charges are pretty unfounded, and the bottomline is the voters will re-elect these people on the merits oftheir service,'' said committee spokeswoman Peggy Connolly. ``Thevoters serve as jurors on Election Day.''   Swindall, 38, was indicted on 10 counts of lying to a grand juryinvestigating a drug money-laundering scheme. Swindall says he willrepresent himself at his trial, which could begin as early asMonday, and expresses confidence his name will be cleared beforethe Nov. 8 election.   Jones, a recovering alcoholic and an actor who played Cooter themechanic in the television series, ``Dukes of Hazzard,'' is takinghis second shot at Swindall's seat. He held Swindall to 53 percentof the vote in 1986, before any of the Republican incumbent'scurrent troubles began.   Swindall is the 16th congressman to be indicted in the pastdecade and the third in the current Congress, after Ford and formerRep. Mario Biaggi, D-N.Y. Biaggi resigned after his conviction intwo unrelated corruption cases, but his name will appear on the NewYork ballot as a Republican.   Numerous other House members were investigated by Hill ethicspanels in the past two years, but few if any seem likely to suffernegative consequences in the election three weeks away.   Last December, the House reprimanded Rep. Austin Murphy, D-Pa.,for permitting votes to be cast in his name when he was absent,diverting House resources to his former law firm and putting aghost employee on his payroll. But Murphy, who represents a heavilyDemocratic district in western Pennsylvania, faces only tokenopposition to re-election.   Another member, Democrat Charlie Rose of North Carolina, was``sharply rebuked'' by the House ethics panel in March forborrowing campaign funds for personal use. He is expected to winre-election easily.   So is House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, the highly visibletarget of an ethics committee investigation triggered by Rep. NewtGingrich, R-Ga. Wright has no rival for his Fort Worth seat.   The ethics panel is investigating six allegations againstWright, including using his office improperly to lobby governmentofficials on matters in which he had a financial interest, andreceiving unusually fat royalties from a book published by acampaign contractor.   Others who were targets of ethics investigations included:   _Rep. Ferdinand St Germain, D-R.I., chairman of the HouseBanking Committee. The House ethics panel cleared him of wrongdoinglast year after a 14-month investigation into allegations he hadused his influence to amass a $2 million fortune in real estateinvestments. Still pending are allegations that he failed to reportmeals and entertainment paid by a housing industry lobbyist. Recentpolls show St Germain with a nearly 2-1 lead over a weak opponent.   _Rep. Mary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio. She kept an aide on her payrollfor nearly two years after the aide had moved from Washington toNew York, in violation of House rules. Ms. Oakar reimbursed thegovernment and was not disciplined, and she has virtually nocompetition in seeking re-election.   _Former Rep. Bill Boner, D-Tenn. The ethics panel said inDecember that Boner improperly used campaign funds for a trip toHong Kong and may have accepted a bribe from a defense contractorin the form of $50,000 in legal fees paid to his wife. But Bonerhad already resigned to become mayor of Nashville, and the panelsaid it no longer had jurisdiction.   In addition, at least two congressmen allegedly subjected femaleaides to sexual harassment. One of them, Rep. Ernie Konnyu,R-Calif., was the first and only incumbent to lose a primary thisyear. The other, Rep. Jim Bates, D-Calif., is expected to winre-election.   Rep. Roy Dyson, D-Md., had a rocky year. His administrativeassistant committed suicide after a newspaper reported that theaide had required young male staffers to socialize with him. AndDyson's ties with defense contractors were scrutinized inconnection with the Pentagon procurement fraud investigation.   Dyson has denied any wrongdoing and is running against the sameRepublican candidate he steamrollered by a 2-1 margin in the 1986election.   Another Democrat whose name surfaced in the Pentagon inquiry,Rep. Bill Chappell of Florida, is also expected to coast to an easyre-election victory.   Rep. Robert Garcia, D-N.Y., who acknowledges he is beinginvestigated in connection with the Wedtech corruption scandal inthe Bronx, also is a safe re-election bet.   Rep. James Traficant, D-Ohio, is trying to beat the InternalRevenue Service's demand for $90,000 in back taxes from unreportedbribe income. Traficant was acquitted after a criminal trial ofaccepting the bribes, but the IRS insists it is owed the money.Traficant's appeal is pending in federal court, but he faces noproblem at the polls.   A non-voting delegate to Congress, Democrat Fofo Sunia ofAmerican Samoa, resigned this fall after being convicted of payrollpadding.</TEXT></DOC>
