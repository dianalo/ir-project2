A total of 17 mineral types wereidentified, along with 16 metal elements in the form of oxides and sulfides.Approximately 70% of the minerals were made up of phyllosilicates, inparticular clay, mica, and talc; three metal elements, Fe, Al, and Ti,accounted for more than 75% of the recovered oxide particles. The meanconcentration of the observed inorganic particles was approximately 1.8X 10(5) pp/mg dry tissue. No significant differences were observed interms of total particulate concentration in the various areas of thelungs and between the right and left lung. Instead we observed a largerconcentration of fibrous particles in the upper lobes. The analysis ofthe data made it possible to determine the presence of a high degreeof correlation between the concentrations of silicates and the concentrationsof metal oxides and sulfides, implying the existence of a ubiquitousenvironmental source of these mineral particles. The frequent observationof tremolite fibers is remarkable. This finding, confirmed elsewhere,indicates that the magnitude of the sources of these fibers in the environment,constituted by contaminated talc dusts, has been underestimated untiltoday.</TEXT></DOC>
