Payload Systems Inc. of Wellsley, Mass., in an enterpriseapproved by the Commerce Department, will grow protein crystals forU.S. industry with the help of a Soviet cosmonaut who will be givenonly minimal information about the projects, said Anthony Arrott,company research and development director.   Payload Systems received a two-year government license tocontract with the Soviets for protein crystallization productionexperiments aboard the Soviet space station Mir, which is alreadyin orbit, Arrott said in a telephone interview Sunday.   ``It's a multiflight, multiyear agreement beginning in 1989,''he said, adding that part of the agreement includes non-disclosureof the amount to be paid to the Soviets who reportedly have offeredto carry Western experiments for between $10,000 and $15,000 akilogram.   Arrott said the agreement was signed with the Soviet Union'sagency for international trade agreements, Licensintorg. Thecivilian space agency, Glavkosmos, oversees the space station.   The agreement will help American industry keep up in theproduction of protein crystals used to develop new drugs until theUnited States gets long-term orbiting laboratories in the 1990s,Arrott said.   ``We want to keep American industry competitive over this timeperiod,'' he said.   Payload Systems was founded in 1984 by Byron K. Lichtenberg ofthe Massachusetts Institute of Technology to provide consultationfor companies that want to use the commercial potential of outerspace. In December 1983, Lichtenberg became the first non-astronautto fly aboard a U.S. space shuttle. He conducted proteincrystallization experiments that provided evidence that larger andmore regular crystals can be grown in a weightless environment,Arrott said.   He said crystals to be grown in the weightless environmentaboard the space station could be used by Payload Systems clients,but company attorney Mark S. McConnell of Washington, D.C., saidcrystals grown in the first flight would not be sold.   ``They're just trying to see if it works for commercialpurposes,'' McConnell said. He said the Soviets' goal in acceptingthe arrangment ``from what I could tell is to promote commercialuses worldwide of their station.''   ``To my knowledge, it is the first time that the U.S. governmenthas approved commercial activity in the Soviet space program,'' hesaid, noting that the two countries have hadgovernment-to-government programs in space.   Since the explosion of the Challenger space shuttle in January1986, U.S. companies have had few alternatives for commercial spaceprojects. Some companies have used European satellites.   Arrott said that even when the U.S. shuttle flights resume laterthis year, they could not provide the weeks and months ofweightlessness needed to develop crystals commercially.   U.S. officials have been concerned that private experimentsmight transmit valuable technology to the Soviets, but McConnellsaid steps are being taken to ensure against this.   ``There will be extremely limited training given to thecosmonauts. They will be doing no more than turning some dials on abox, the contents of which they will not know about, and monitoringenvironmental conditions in the space station,'' he said.   President Reagan included in his budget released last week $1billion toward construction of a U.S. space station by themid-1990s. A smaller space module is planned to be put into orbitfor commercial use earlier in the decade.</TEXT></DOC>
