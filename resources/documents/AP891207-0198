(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Leaving nature to repair itself won'tcounter the damage caused by people, say park managers hoping torestore the grassy marshes and hardwood hammocks of the Evergladesto their turn-of-the-century condition.   If nature were allowed to take its course in Everglades NationalPark, the hardy melaleuca tree, an Australian invader, could takeover and displace every native plant _ already the condition insome tracts near the park's borders.   Proponents of restoration ecology call it the park managementphilosophy of the future, and say park managers abdicated theirresponsibility when they left Yellowstone National Park, forexample, to recover from fires that damaged more than two-fifths ofthe 2.2 million-acre park.   ``Basically they're doing nothing,'' said Thomas Bonnicksen, aTexas Aandamp;M professor who recently lectured to a group of Evergladesscientists. ``By and large, they're standing back and proclaimingevery little blade of grass that comes up a masterpiece of God'swork.''   ``Restoration is nothing more than looking back at what we hadwhen we set the areas aside,'' he said. ``In many cases,particularly in North America, the national parks resemble verylittle what they were when they were set aside.   ``Our goal is to replace and increase the biological diversityon this planet that we've lost, and we are convinced that simplydeclaring places as reserves, putting fences around them andstanding back and watching them is going to lead to a reduction inbiological diversity because the areas around the preserve areignored and the areas in the preserve are degraded.''   The National Park Service sees ``a lot of value in some of theprinciples'' of ecological restoration, said spokesman DuncanMorrow in Washington.   For example, the agency is trying to eject some unwanted,non-native animals _ notably burros in the Grand Canyon and DeathValley and European wild boar in the Great Smoky Mountains, Morrowsaid. ``Some of the major intrusions which seem to be susceptibleto management we have already undertaken to remove. Others we arelooking at finding ways that might work.   ``You'd have to temper what seem to be desirable goals with somesense of what can, in fact, be accomplished.''   Restoration ecology is practiced most commonly on a small scale,on grasslands, wetlands, lakes and forest tracts. But the Canadianpark service adopted the concept for its sprawling Banff NationalPark, said Bonnicksen, a director of the 1,200-member, 18-month-oldSociety for Ecological Restoration.   In choosing a target date as a guide to what a restored parkshould look like, 1900 has been a common reference point for theEverglades.   ``What is it that we really want to do? Until we can put thisdown straight in our minds, we're going to flounder,'' said GeorgeGann-Matzen, who grew up on the edge of the Everglades, worked inthe park and now is a consulting restoration ecologist.   Tree ring studies, soil chemistry, old photographs, historicland surveys, an analysis of pollen and charcoal fragments in pondsediment and other methods offer clues to the type and prevalenceof vegetation at a given point in time.   Restoration work can involve anything from planting vegetationthat was known to be in a disturbed area at the benchmark date tomanaging lightning fires to leave a historic blend of trees.   At the Everglades, hydrologists tinkering with water deliveryfor 10 years have been trying to re-create a naturalrainfall-driven system they hope will bring wading birds,alligators, panthers, deer and fish to old haunts.   ``It's a tradeoff. The alligator prefers deeper water conditionsthan the wading bird,'' said Bob Johnson, the park's hydrologicprogram manager. ``The idea is to come up with some range ofhydrologic conditions.''   The Nature Conservancy estimates a minimum $10 per acre forminor restoration, Gann-Matzen said. His firm charges $100 peracre, and highly disturbed areas cost $10,000 to $15,000 an acre toreach a maintenance condition, which then requires regular followup.   Restoration may be more attractive in the Everglades than otherparks because the signs of trouble _ a stunning drop in wadingbirds and threats to numerous animal and plant species _ areobvious, Bonnicksen said. ``The changes that take place in theforest are not as easily seen by the untrained eye as the changesthat take place in a place like the Everglades.''   If restoration ecology is pursued in the Everglades, he said,``It may in fact turn out to be the first national park thatactually is managed to restore its historic integrity, and it mayserve as a model for other national parks.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Dec. 11</NOTE></DOC>
