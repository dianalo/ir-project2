The Fed said its M2 measure grew $2.6 billion, not evenenough to offset a surprisingly steep $9.7 billion declinethe week before.</LP><TEXT>   If growth of the money supply doesn't perk up soon,pressure is likely to mount within the Fed for another roundof interest rate cuts. The Fed last week cited the &quot;weakness&quot;in the money supply as the primary factor in cutting itshighly visible discount rate.   Week-to-week changes in the money supply aren't important,but so far this year M2 -- which includes currency, checkingaccounts and some savings accounts and money market funds --has grown at only a 2.4% annual rate. The Fed's target rangeis 2.5% to 6.5%, and the Fed usually aims for the middle ofits range -- or 4.5%.   Fed officials are convinced that the economy, particularlythe manufacturing sector, is crawling out of the recession.But the sluggish growth of the money supply is compoundingworries within the Fed about the breadth and durability ofthe economy's recovery.   &quot;If the rate of growth in money and credit doesn'taccelerate quickly, the Fed may not wait long&quot; to nudge ratesdown again, predicts Fed watcher Robert Chandross at LloydsBank in New York.   The recent behavior of the money supply makesinterest-rate cuts easier to sell within the Fed because somehard-line inflation foes, who tend to be reluctant to easeinterest rates, are close watchers of the money supply.   Some Fed officials suggest another 1/2- to3/4-percentage-point cut in the key federal funds rate may beneeded to get the money supply growing closer to the Fed'starget. Based on the Fed's gradualist approach so far underChairman Alan Greenspan, however, the most likely move isanother 1/4-percentage-point cut in the federal funds ratesometime in the next several weeks.   The federal funds rate, which banks charge each other onovernight loans, is currently around 5.25%. By pumping creditinto the banking system, the Fed nudges down this interestrate and increases the supply of credit in the economy.   Based on internal models, Fed staff economists have beenprojecting a rebound in money growth for some time. Technicalexplanations for the shortfall abound, but aren't convincingenough for some Fed policy makers. &quot;If the economy wererobust, I might be willing to wait another month or two,&quot;said one Fed official.   The Fed said its narrower M1 measure of the money supplyfell $400 million in the week ended Sept. 9, while thebroader M3 measure fell $500 million.</TEXT></DOC>
