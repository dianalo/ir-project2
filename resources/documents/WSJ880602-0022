Schering said the companies had stipulated in the revised agreement that the transaction wouldn't proceed without expedited review by the Federal Trade Commission. The Madison, N.J., drug company said the FTC declined to provide such a review.    The companies revised their accord after the FTC early last month voted to ask a court to block on antitrust grounds Schering's proposed acquisition of Cooper's contact-lens business for about $150 million. Cooper is a Palo Alto, Calif.-based maker of medical products.    The revised agreement excluded Cooper's color contact lens business from the transaction and would have made Cooper's lens-molding technology available for licensing to vision-care companies.    Collapse of the revised agreement represents a blow to cash-strapped Cooper, which needs funds to pay down its heavy debt load. As reported earlier, the company put itself on the block, either in segments or as a whole, after the initial accord with Schering-Plough was called off because of regulatory concerns. Cooper has continued its efforts to sell itself, despite the subsequent attempt to resuscitate the sale.    &quot;We're disappointed,&quot; said a Cooper spokesman, adding that the company is &quot;going to continue our very vigorous effort to sell the optometric business,&quot; as well as the company's other operations. The spokesman added: &quot;It's my understanding that at the present time we are in compliance&quot; with the company's debt covenants. He declined to comment on whether the company expects any difficulties in meeting its near-term obligations.    Schering's announcement came after the close of trading yesterday. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Schering closed at $52.625, up 50 cents; Cooper closed unchanged at $11.875. </TEXT></DOC>
