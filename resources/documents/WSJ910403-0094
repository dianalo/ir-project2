The lens, a six-inch long collection of tiny glass tubes,seems to solve cheaply a problem that has dogged researchersfor years: how to create an intense, focused source of X-rayradiation. But while other scientists confirmed the basicvalidity of the physicists' work, they cautioned that furtherexperiments are needed to determine its commercial viabilityfor several possible uses.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The physics is correct, these guys are bright -- there'snothing fundamentally wrong anywhere,&quot; said Gwyn Williams, aphysicist at Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island,N.Y. &quot;What's needed now is a lot more basic research anddevelopment on possible applications. It's so early to beannouncing something like this.&quot;   Walter Gibson, a physicist at the State University of NewYork at Albany and one of the X-ray lens' developers, gave aseminar on the new technology at Brookhaven last month.   If the new lens proves out, it will have far-reachingimplications in several fields. In the computer industry, forexample, the tiny electrical circuits on silicon chips areetched in much the same way photographs are developed -- byshining light through a &quot;mask&quot; onto a light-sensitivematerial. But for circuits to get tinier and denser, expertsexpect X-rays, which have a shorter wavelength, will have toreplace light as the source of illumination for futuregenerations of chips.   Until now, research on X-ray lithography, as such achip-making process is called, has been stymied by thedifficulty of channeling enough intense X-rays to expose achip quickly. As a result, most efforts have focused simplyon making sources of X-rays more powerful -- a very expensiveapproach that has led to the building of severalsynchrotrons, huge ring-shaped devices that produce intenseX-rays and can cost as much as $50 million each. Thisapproach has also led smaller chip-makers to fret that onlygiant companies will be able to afford to make the densechips of the future.   But now, said Dr. Gibson, the prospect of an effectiveX-ray lens should level the playing field by allowing chipmakers to use conventional X-ray sources for lithography.&quot;This makes {X-ray lithography} available for many smallmanufacturers that can't afford to spend huge sums of money,&quot;he said.   A spokesman for International Business Machines Corp.,which has already built a synchrotron in East Fishkill, N.Y.,and is considered a leader in X-ray lithography, said thecompany had been briefed by Dr. Gibson on the new X-ray lens.&quot;It falls into the category of ideas that are important toexplore further,&quot; the spokesman said. He noted that producingintense X-rays is only one of several major problems faced inX-ray lithography, and that an X-ray lens would magnify theabilities of a synchrotron.   In the medical arena, focusing X-rays would likely allowdoctors to take more precise pictures of small features likearteries. Scientists said the lens would also aid in cancertherapy, because the ability to concentrate X-rays in aparticular location would greatly reduce the dangers ofradiation therapy. Current X-ray therapy often exposeshealthy tissue to more radiation than is absorbed by a localtumor, Dr. Gibson said.   Moreover, no further experimentation needs to be done toprove the value of the lens in therapy, said Dr. Williams ofthe Brookhaven National Laboratory. &quot;They have demonstratedthat they can concentrate X-ray energy,&quot; he said. &quot;I'msatisifed that {the lens} would be useful there.&quot;   On a more mundane level, effective X-ray focusing mightmean, for example, that dental patients wouldn't need to wearbulky lead shields when they get their teeth X-rayed. &quot;In thefuture, every machine in which X-rays are used will includesome {of the new} optics,&quot; said Dr. Gibson.   The X-ray lens, invented in the early 1980s by a Sovietphysicist named Muradin Kumakhov, doesn't use any radicaltechnology. The main principle employed by the device -- thatX-rays can be reflected off smooth surfaces at very slightangles -- has been known for decades, and is the basis forseveral large X-ray telescopes.   Dr. Kumakhov's insight was that the phenomenon couldchannel X-rays through large bundles of tiny glass fibers,each of which would bend a small amount of X-ray energy by&quot;bouncing&quot; it off the fiber's smooth walls. By tapering thefibers toward one another, the energy could then be focusedon a small spot.</TEXT></DOC>
