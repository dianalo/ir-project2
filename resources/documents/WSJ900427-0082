Keller   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>04/27/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A7A</SO><CO>   NT BCE</CO><IN>TELEPHONE SYSTEMS (TLS)</IN><LP>   TORONTO -- By most appearances, Northern Telecom Ltd.'schief executive officer, Paul G. Stern, turned in a strongperformance in 1989, his first year at the helm. On Tuesday,the telecommunications equipment company reported a healthyfirst quarter as well, aided by a cost-cutting andrestructuring program.   Profit rose 50% to $74 million, or 30 cents a share,against $47 million, or 20 cents a share, in the year-earlierfirst quarter, the company said. Revenue climbed 14% to $1.6billion and orders and order backlog topped last year'speriod by 13% to $1.5 billion and $1.87 billion,respectively.</LP><TEXT>   But Mr. Stern, in an effort he vaguely refers to as Vision2000, wants Northern to grow to $30 billion in annual revenuein 10 years -- five times current sales. To make it, Northernwill need more than the phone switches that boosted itsresults in the 1980s. It also must improve its internationalperformance and capture about 10% of the projected $300billion market for switching and transmission systems.   &quot;By (Vision 2000) we mean, `What do we want to be when wegrow up?'&quot; Mr. Stern says. &quot;How do we establish leadership?&quot;   In the late 1970s, Northern used its trend-setting officephone switches and DMS-10 digital switch for phone companiesto venture beyond its parochial Canadian perch and beatmighty American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. in its own market.Northern now holds close to one third of the $10 billion U.S.market for digital switches, according to Northern BusinessInformation Inc., an unrelated Manhattan-based research firm.   Now the U.S. switch market is maturing, and Mr. Stern istrying to expand his transmission business -- an area thatATandamp;T dominates with a 52% share, compared with Northern's 6%,according to Northern Business Information. He also wants abigger share of the market outside North America. NorthernTelecom currently derives about 10% of its business fromforeign customers such as Nippon Telegraph andamp; Telephone Corp.,Turkey's telephone administration, British Telecom PLC andEuropean corporate and banking customers of its office phoneand data networking systems.   To do this, Northern is trying to boost orders for itsswitches overseas. And it's pushing a line of fiber-optictransmission systems and a network design concept calledFiber World.   Northern unveiled its line of fiber-optic systems beforerivals such as ATandamp;T, Rockwell International Inc. and Japan'sNEC Corp. &quot;Invariably, {customers} buy a product because asupplier has a uniqueness,&quot; Mr. Stern says. &quot;When you'refirst, the perception lingers.&quot;   Perhaps. But on numerous other key products, Northernhasn't been the first to market for some time, says MariaLewis, an analyst at Shearson Lehman. She notes that much ofthe equipment market is moving toward mobile communications,a market to which Northern paid little attention beforerivals such as Sweden's AB Ericsson, Motorola Inc. andJapanese suppliers moved in to dominate it.   &quot;Northern got lucky in 1989 from cost-cutting and fromselling upgraded processors for existing switches -- abusiness that's not going to be around to the same extent in1990,&quot; said Ms. Lewis. &quot;Stern has to improve Northern'sfiber-optics penetration. There's no place else for him togo.&quot;   Mr. Stern, who yesterday added the title of chairman whenhe took over from the retiring Edmund B. Fitzgerald, says theFiber World program is &quot;going fine.&quot; But he says it's tooearly to tell how sales will stack up this year, sincecustomers such as MCI Communications Corp. and Bell AtlanticCorp. are just beginning to install and test the systems intheir networks.   Nobody questions Mr. Stern's talent. A hard-nosedoperations expert, he works 15-hour days, and previously heldupper-management jobs in some of the world's largestcorporations, including International Business Machines Corp.and Unisys Corp. As a director of Northern Telecom, he becameintimately familiar with the company's operations and, in1988 was coaxed out of early retirement to save the companyfrom itself.   In nine months as president and chief executive heaccelerated Northern's restructuring program, shutting fourof 47 plants, selling a fifth facility to employees andcutting 2,500 jobs. He even changed the bonus system, tyingemployee incentives in each business unit to thecorporation's performance.   Mr. Stern also reshuffled management, bringing in a newchief financial officer, Martin Mand, from Du Pont Co., andshifting President David Vice to vice chairman in charge ofproducts and technology.   The results were a paring of Northern's expenses in 1989to 18.5% of revenues from 20.1% the year before. In addition,profit soared 18% on a 13% increase in sales in 1989.   Mr. Stern says: &quot;It was a very tough year, not in themarketplace, but on all our people. The pace of change wasvery fast.&quot; And not likely to slow down anytime soon.</TEXT></DOC>
