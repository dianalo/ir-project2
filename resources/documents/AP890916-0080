About 50 chanting protesters, many survivors of the bombing,refused to allow Capt. Peter Roberts of the U.S. frigate Rodney M.Davis to approach a large memorial statue in the center ofNagasaki's Peace Memorial Park.   The statue is dedicated to victims of the U.S. atomic bombing ofNagasaki at the end of World War II.   Roberts and other crew members instead placed a wreath about 100feet away from the statue. After they left, several protesterspushed the wreath over and stamped on it.   National television broadcast scenes of the protest.   The Japan Broadcasting Corp. quoted Senji Yamaguchi, chairman ofthe Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Victims Council, as saying the group wasprotesting because of the possibility the ship was carrying nuclearweapons.   The agency quoted Roberts as saying he regretted the incident,but that it would not affect his friendship with the people ofNagasaki.   Japan forbids the production, possession or introduction ofnuclear weapons into its territory, but many people believe U.S.Navy ships routinely enter Japan with such weapons aboard.   Kyodo News Service reported that Nagasaki Mayor Hiroshi Motoshimarefused to accompany Roberts to the park Saturday after Robertsrefused to confirm or deny that nuclear weapons were on board theship.   The frigate is the first U.S. Navy ship to visit Nagasaki sincethe city decided in 1974 not to allow port calls by ships fromcountries that possess nuclear weapons, Kyodo said.   It said the city agreed to the visit because of the mutualsecurity treaty between the United States and Japan.   The U.S. military maintains a policy of not publicly confirmingor denying the presence of nuclear weapons.   An estimated 70,000 people died when the United States dropped anatomic bomb on Nagasaki on Aug. 9, 1945, three days after the cityof Hiroshima became the world's first victim of an atomic attack.</TEXT></DOC>
