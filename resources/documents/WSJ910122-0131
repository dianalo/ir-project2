Favorable earnings reports by some of the unlistedmarket's major technology-related stocks continue to spurbuying in the sector, traders said.</LP><TEXT>   Last week, Apple Computer posted first-quarter earnings of$1.28 a share -- at the high end of analysts' expectations --and on Friday Microsoft reported higher-than-expectedsecond-quarter net of 91 cents a share against 63 cents ayear ago.   Yesterday, Microsoft jumped 4 1/4 to 89 1/2 on theearnings news and on reports that analysts at Shearson LehmanBrothers; Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette and Goldman, Sachs andamp;Co. all raised their fiscal 1991 estimates for the company.   Shearson analyst David Readerman, for example, raised hisforecast to $3.40 a share from $3.30, according to Dow JonesProfessional Investor Report.

National Market System volume, though, was a light78,977,000 shares, compared with Friday's 113,064,000 shares.   The rising prices of technology issues pushed OTC stockshigher despite the declines on the Big Board, traders said.Because the unlisted market's indexes are more heavilyweighted with technology-related stocks than the Big Boardindexes are, gains in that sector have a greater effect inthe OTC market.   &quot;As long as technology acts well, then our market will actwell,&quot; said Steve Bliss, head of OTC trading at Mabon Nugent.&quot;They are sort of pulling everyone along with them.&quot;   Despite the market's big appetite for high-technologyissues, John Schraff, of Daiwa Securities America, said he issomewhat suspicious about the segment's ability to continuerising after the strong gains over the past several sessions.   Microsoft closed yesterday at a new 52-week high, AppleComputer hit a 52-week high of 52 3/4 last week and CiscoSystems closed yesterday up 3 to a 52-week high of 52 3/4.   But Mr. Schraff still sees the possibility of yesterday'srally carrying over to this morning. He said &quot;momentumplayers&quot; aided the market's advance yesterday -- particularlylate in the session -- and he added that these players mayemerge again this morning.   Momentum players, he said, pile cash into whatever marketsegment is &quot;fashionable,&quot; hoping to score a short-termprofit.
