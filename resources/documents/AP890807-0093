Algeria's ambassador, who has acted as an intermediary, saidgetting the hostages released might take a year or more.   Israel on Monday rejected a new demand for release of akidnapped Lebanese Shiite cleric and urged Shiite radicals to usethe Red Cross to arrange a hostage-prisoner swap. Israeli officialssaid the government would only accept a deal if three Israelisoldiers were included.   President Bush was described by White House press secretaryMarlin Fitzwater as ``cautiously optimistic'' about the Americanhostages in Lebanon. However, Fitzwater said, ``He knows that it'sprobably going to be a longer period of time rather than shorter''before the matter is resolved.   ``Certain tendencies, certain trends in the internationalclimate ... suggest that circumstances may be more conducive to asettlement to the hostages problem now than they have been sometimein the past,'' said Marrack Goulding, U.N. undersecretary-generalfor peacekeeping operations.   ``Many governments and organizations will have to take part. Itwill be a cooperative effort.''   ``It's a very difficult and very complicated problem in whichthere are a large number of elements and a large number of playersinvolved,'' Goulding said in Beirut after five days of meetings inLebanon and Syria.   Goulding met Monday in west Beirut with Salim Hoss, premier of aMoslem Cabinet that vies for power with a Christian government, andSheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, spiritual adviser of thefundamentalist Shiite Moslem group Hezbollah, or Party of God.   Hezbollah is believed to be an umbrella for pro-Iraniankidnappers holding most of the 16 Western hostages in Lebanon,eight of whom are Americans.   Khaled Hasnawi, the Algerian ambassador, also met with Hoss andlater with Sheik Sobhi Tofaili, a senior Hezbollah leader.   Tofaili and Hasnawi told reporters they focused on ways ofgetting Israel to free Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, a cleric affiliatedwith Hezbollah. Israeli commandos abducted Obeid on July 28 fromhis home in south Lebanon.   Israel has offered to trade Obeid and other Lebanese Shiites itholds for the Western hostages and three Israeli soldiers held inLebanon.   Hasnawi sounded optimistic about a swap when he began hismediation last week on orders of Chadli Bendjedid, president ofAlgeria.   Asked on Monday about his views, the ambassador said: ``Ihaven't set a deadline in any of my previous statements. It mighttake one, two or even three years.''   Goulding said he unable to determine whether Lt. Col. William R.Higgins was killed by his pro-Iranian captors.   ``I have not been able to ascertain whether Colonel Higgins wasstill alive,'' he said. ``I hope that he is but I haven't been ableto confirm that he is. Equally, I haven't been able to confirm thathe is dead. The question remains an open one.''   A group calling itself the Organization of the Oppressed onEarth said it hanged the U.S. Marine officer July 31 in retaliationfor Israel's abduction of Obeid three days earlier.   Higgins, 44, commanded U.N. truce observers when he waskidnapped Feb. 17, 1988, in south Lebanon. His captors released apoor-quality videotape July 31 purporting to show him dangling froma make-shift scaffold.   The FBI said in Washington its forensic experts believed thevideotape showed Higgins, but offered no conclusion on when or howthe death occurred.   In Fort Myer, Va., Bush paid tribute to Higgins on Monday as``the symbol of the courage that burns in the breast of everyAmerican in uniform.''   Goulding said he would fly back to New York ``fairly soon'' toreport to Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar ``on what Ihave been told and what my conclusions are. There we will considerwhat to do next.''   His aides said he had scheduled meetings Tuesday in Jerusalemwith Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's defense minister, and Deputy ForeignMinister Benjamin Netanyahu.   On Sunday, kidnappers holding American hostage Joseph Cicippio,58, offered to free him if Israel released 450 Arab prisoners andallowed the return of 55 Palestinian deported from the occupiedWest Bank and Gaza Strip.   Israel said Monday there would be no exchange without its threesoldiers.   ``It is obvious we will not agree to a partial exchange, saidAvi Pazner, chief spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir.   Rabin, interviewed by ABC News, said Israel had received no``real proposal'' for an exchange. If the Shiite groups want asolution, he said, ``they have to turn to the right, properchannels of the International Red Cross, and then we'll startnegotiations.''   Hussein Mousawi, a senior Hezbollah leader, said Sunday one ofthe soldiers might be killed unless Israel released Obeid.   Alon Liel, Foreign Ministry spokesman, said Monday the Israeliswould hold Syria and Iran responsible for the safety of thesoldiers.   Cicippio's Lebanese wife, Elham Ghandour, a secretary at theU.S. Embassy in Beirut, said she felt encouraged by Sunday's offerfrom the Revolutionary Justice Organization, the name his captorsuse. Her husband was kidnapped Sept. 12, 1986.   ``I believe everybody is on the right track, which isencouraging. I'm optimistic,'' Mrs. Cicippio told The AssociatedPress. She would not elaborate.   The Western hostage held longest is Terry A. Anderson, 41, theAP's chief Middle East correspondent, kidnapped March 16, 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
