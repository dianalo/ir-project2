They said that such an understanding was reached at the group'slast full ministerial meeting in November.   Representatives from OPEC's 13 member countries agreed at thatgathering to limit output to 18.5 million barrels a day to achievea target price of $18 a barrel. Their current production isestimated at 19.6 million barrels a day.   The sources said that if the $19-price trigger was pulled, themarket would see increased oil output from member countries, manyof whom are operating at well below their potential productioncapacity.   The OPEC oil basket price was at $18.49 a barrel at middayWednesday, compared with $18.25 a barrel a week ago.   The basket is calculated as a running seven-day average of thespot, or non-contact, prices of seven crude oils.   The sources were responding to questions about what OPEC'sresponse would be to the shutdown of the entire North Sea Brentproduction and delivery system following an accident late Tuesday.   The gas leak and explosion on Shell U.K. Exploration andProduction's Cormorant Alpha platform reduced North Sea oil outputby 472,000 barrels a day, or by one-quarter of the British sector'stotal output. There were no injuries.   The accident pushed up oil prices sharply. The spot price ofBrent Blend, the most widely traded international crude oil, wastrading at $21.50 a barrel in London late Wednesday morning, upfrom $20.05 late Tuesday.
