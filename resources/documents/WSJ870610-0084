Buckley last August.    The proxy statement also disclosed that all contractual non-pension agreements between Mr. Buckley and the company, such as stock options, were terminated. Mr. Buckley had parking privileges and secretarial services after he was ousted, but those privileges were rescinded May 31.    The company, which makes consumer, industrial and technological products, also took a hard line toward Mr. Buckley regarding legal fees. Allegheny said it authorized advances to current officers and directors and certain former officers and directors -- except Mr. Buckley -- to battle a score of lawsuits and a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation.    Mr. Buckley was forced to resign last August amid news reports and several shareholder suits alleging a history of extravagance and waste as the company was losing millions of dollars. Among other things, the suits charge, Mr. Buckley made personal use of the company's fleet of five jets and persuaded the company to buy a controlling share of a Florida condominium in which he and other Allegheny officials owned apartments.    Mr. Buckley couldn't be reached for comment.    The proxy statement said that Mr. Buckley's wife &quot;usually accompanied him on business trips,&quot; while the wives of other officers occasionally also traveled on company aircraft. Allegheny rented a condominium to Mr. Buckley's daughter in Sewickley, Pa. -- the affluent suburb where Mr. Buckley lives -- for $500 a month plus utilities. Three of Mr. Buckley's sons worked for Allegheny, including one who lived rent-free in the penthouse of a company-owned hotel where he was employed as manager.    Under Mr. Buckley's stewardship, Allegheny also paid $32,500 in 1986 legal expenses for investment partnerships in which Mr. Buckley, along with two former executives, Graemer K. Hilton and Timothy L. Guzzle, and board member Spencer R. Stuart had interests, according to the proxy statement. In addition, Allegheny absorbed $14,500 for accounting expenses and kept the books and records of those partnerships until last August.    Allegheny said it was unable to determine whether any officers benefited personally from use of a company-owned condominium in Ligonier, Pa., as the company didn't keep a guest book for the condominium during 1986. Furthermore, the company said no records were kept regarding the personal use of company-owned wine. As previously reported, an Allegheny subsidiary installed an elaborate wine cellar in Mr. Buckley's home.    The company said that Mr. Buckley was fired &quot;for cause&quot; and that &quot;all contractual rights he had with the corporation were terminated except for rights under the Pension Plan.&quot; Those rights would have given Mr. Buckley half of his monthly salary for almost 10 years and 140,000 nonrestricted stock options. Mr. Buckley's annual salary was $439,887.    Mr. Buckley's employment contract, which would have provided him with a salary for three years after leaving the company, was also canceled, because he was fired &quot;for cause.&quot; Other officers who have resigned in the past year continue to receive payments. Anthony Shanagher's employment contract, which runs until May 1990, wasn't terminated after his recent resignation as chief financial officer. He will continue to receive his annual base salary of $245,000, as well as certain benefits until then, the proxy statement said.    Mr. Buckley will continue to receive benefits under the pension plan. Those benefits, based on a retirement date of March 31, 1987, would be about $12,900 a month plus a one-time pension payment of $106,944. </TEXT></DOC>
