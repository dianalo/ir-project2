The formation of isolated Ti(III) ions wasdetected by the EPR method. Depending on the conditions of synthesisand type of polymer carrier, their amount reached 55% of the immobilizedtitanium. Experimental proofs were obtained for the formation of Ti(III)via the stage of alkylation of Ti(IV) by a magnesium-containing coating.Based on the dependence of the g-factor of the Ti(III) signals on theconditions of its formation, it was suggested that the fragments of thepolymer carrier enter the coordination sphere of Ti(III) at low Ti(III)concentrations in the GTMC and that stratification reactions of Ti(III)take place at high concentrations. The existence of crystallites of theactive phase with dimensions of the regions of coherent scattering of40-75 A was found by x-ray diffraction analysis. A correlation was foundbetween the activity of GTMC in the polymerization of ethylene and theTi(III) content in them in the form of isolated ions.</TEXT></DOC>
