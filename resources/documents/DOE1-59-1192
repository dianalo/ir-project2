In each individual patient fluctuationsof anti-dsDNA levels were reflected in the titre of overall antinuclearantibodies (ANA), but not in the levels of total serum IgG, IgM, IgAand IgD. Longitudinal observations revealed a close relationship perindividual patient between the amount of anti-dsDNA antibodies, measuredwith the Farr assay, the titre of anti-dsDNA of the various Ig classes,and the complement binding capacity of anti-dsDNA. However, when serafrom different patients were compared, no correlation between the aboveparameters was found, suggesting qualitative next to quantitative differencesamong antibodies to dsDNA in the different patients. These observationsdemonstrate the specificity of ANA for S.L.E., but also that the wholespectrum of ANA might be responsible for the variety of disease symptoms.</TEXT></DOC>
