This weekend, the preface to the 1992 presidentialcampaign -- so long in starting, so resistant to earlydefinition -- starts to close. And by the end of the year,the countours of the race should finally be distinguishable.</LP><TEXT>   Tomorrow, Florida's Democrats gather in the shadow ofDisney World for a weekend convention that includes the onlypresidential balloting of 1991 -- a nonbinding straw poll ofconvention delegates that has no meaning beyond the symbolicbut which for the past several weeks has become something ofa political battlefield.   Hours after the balloting is completed on Sunday, the sixannounced presidential candidates meet at 6:30 p.m. EST foran hour-and-a-half debate to be carried live on NBC. By theend of next week, the lengthy deliberations of New York Gov.Mario Cuomo should be finished. And at the end of the month,the first meaningful indications of the resources of theDemocratic contenders will come when the candidates closetheir books and prepare for the year-end financial reportsthat must be filed with the Federal Election Commission.   This flurry in the middle of the holiday season mightotherwise be forgotten in an ordinary campaign, whichcustomarily would have begun sometime last winter, heated upin the summer and distilled down to a couple of candidatesand issues by Thanksgiving. But the late start -- all but oneof the entrants joined the campaign after Labor Day -- addsweight to events like the NBC debate.   The most important development will be the decision of Mr.Cuomo, which will give final shape to the Democratic raceand, if he decides to run, transform the six current declaredcandidates from suitors for voters' allegiance to challengersof the New York governor.   A new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, conducted Fridaythrough Monday among 1,004 registered voters, shows just howthoroughly Mr. Cuomo dominates the Democratic landscape rightnow. Among Democrats and independents, Mr. Cuomo is thechoice of 30%; no other contender has more than 11%.   At this point in the campaign, year-end events like thestraw poll and debate &quot;give us hints about what is going on,but just hints,&quot; says Thomas Donilon, a Democratic politicalstrategist who isn't involved in the current presidentialcampaign. &quot;This race has only just really begun, and it hasstarted very, very late. It is very dangerous for thesecandidates, because they're going from standing still to fullthrottle in a few weeks.&quot;   The greatest impact may be in New Hampshire, which hasreturned to its customary position as the most importantearly test of the campaign.   &quot;The major candidates have been up here a lot, and there'sthe feeling that things are catching fire,&quot; says StevenMcAuliffe, a Concord Democratic lawyer who ran Sen. JosephBiden's New Hampshire campaign in the last election cycle.&quot;It's going be a quick firestorm and then it's going to beover. After months of waiting, it's finally here.&quot;   From the start, Democratic National Chairman Ronald Brownhas discouraged events like Florida's straw poll of 2,300delegates, regarding such contests as distractions thatsiphon off money from other campaign events only to give anartificial indication of candidates' strength. In 1983, forexample, Democrats spent hundreds of thousands of dollars tomobilize activists in Wisconsin in a struggle won by Sen.Alan Cranston of California. Only months later, Mr. Cranstonfinished seventh in the New Hampshire primary and disappearedfrom the presidential race.   &quot;A month after this straw poll, the whole event will betotally forgotten,&quot; says John Sasso, a Democratic politicalstrategist who mapped Michael Dukakis's route to the 1988nomination. &quot;This won't tell you much because it isn't asignificant test. The campaigns haven't been down there. Itwon't tell you anything about the candidates' potentialappeal.&quot;   That's the line the candidates and their keepers arepublicly peddling themselves. They're all playing down theevent. But they're all quietly making efforts, too.&quot;Everybody's playing,&quot; says George Stephanopoulos, deputycampaign manager for Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas. Onlyformer Gov. Jerry Brown of California and Gov. Douglas Wilderof Virginia aren't competing, although they, too, may have apresence in Orlando.   Mr. Clinton's success at party events late last month andhis quiet mobilization for the straw poll is one of thereasons the stakes have been raised in the inconsequentialFlorida convention.   At the start, Democratic insiders believed that Sen. TomHarkin, a fiery populist with strong ties with organizedlabor, had a natural advantage in the Florida convention,where the delegates tend to be activists and labor oriented.But now Mr. Harkin's forces, troubled about Mr. Clinton'srise, are trying to cut expectations of their candidate'sperformance and are arguing that Florida is a natural part ofMr. Clinton's Southern base.   The candidates will get far broader exposure during Sundaynight's debate. Prime-time television appearances have hadimportant consequences in the early stages of othercampaigns. The poor showing of former Gov. Bruce Babbitt ofArizona in a 1987 debate, for example, all but doomed his1988 prospects.   &quot;It's not the Super Bowl but a scrimmage: We'll know who'slimping and we'll have an idea who is looking sharp,&quot; saysJim Hightower, a former Texas agriculture commissioner and ashrewd political observer.   The debate will be the first national exposure for most ofthese relatively unknown candidates, who conducted the earlypart of their campaigns in a period when President Bush wasregarded as a heavy favorite. Now that the president'spolitical fortunes have dipped, the Democratic debate islikely to win a wider audience.   At the same time, the year-end financial reports, whichclose Dec. 31 and must be filed by Jan. 31, will provide animportant indicator of the candidates' standing.   &quot;Money is the first primary,&quot; says Ellen Miller, executivedirector of the Center for Responsive Politics, a Washingtonresearch group that examines the influence of money inpolitics. &quot;If you have it, you're a viable candidate. If youdon't, you're not.&quot;   This year-end burst of activity is an opportunity for Gov.Clinton to consolidate his position, potentially making himeither the target of his competitors or the leadingalternative to Mr. Cuomo, who must decide by next Friday toenter the race if he is to have a line on the New Hampshireballot.   &quot;This is the time Clinton has to really zoom ahead,&quot; saysElaine Kamarck, who directed the delegate-selection effortfor former Vice President Walter Mondale in 1984 and wasdeputy campaign manager for Mr. Babbitt in 1988. &quot;He's got toshow well in the Florida straw poll, because he's expectedto. He's got to show the audience in the debate that he's thebroadest, most interesting candidate, and he's got to show atleast a respectable amount of money. We will know a lot aboutClinton very soon.&quot;   While Mr. Harkin has won liberal and labor support, formerSen. Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts has carved out a niche forhis &quot;pro-business&quot; Democratic appeal, with special strengthin New Hampshire; and Gov. Clinton has won praise for hiseconomic prescription; Sen. Robert Kerrey of Nebraska stillis struggling for an opening and may find it by Sunday.   &quot;The kickoff is very important for Kerrey,&quot; says SandyMaisel, a Colby College political scientist. &quot;He announced aseverybody's hero and he has just floundered. Kerrey's now thelast person out, and this may be his last chance to asserthimself.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
