SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Bush administration must ``run faster'' andplan better to meet increased competition for civil and militarytechnologies from nations such as Japan and Korea, a top Pentagonadvisory board recommends.   ``National security can no longer be viewed only in militaryterms, but must include economic well-being as a key component. ...This is a distinct departure from the past,'' said the DefenseAdvisory Board, an independent group set up to counsel the Pentagon.   ``The point is, it is not Japan's aggressive roadmap for thefuture that is at fault. Rather, it has been our own inability toget our act together and create a national vision and set of goalsof our own,'' the panel said.   The panel issued a strongly worded report that said the currentpolicies for industrial cooperation and technology transfers ``areno longer appropriate'' and may endanger American's global economicand military well-being.   ``Our economic, as well as our military security, depends vitallyon technological leadership. Technology is the new coinage of therealm and ours has been seriously depleted. ... We cannot maintain alead by conservatism and protectionism. We must run faster!'' saidMalcom Currie, the chairman of Hughes Aircraft Co. and head of thetask group that issued the report.   The report touched on the recent controversy over the jointU.S.-Japanese development of the FSX fighter plane, which set off anacrimonious debate in Congress over concerns about giveaways of U.S.technology to nations eager to use American expertise to build theirown industries.   Some in Congress were angry that the Japanese refused to simplypurchase the plane from the United States as a replacement for theF-16, while others argued the deal promoted exchanges of technologyand helped the U.S. industries involved.   ``The fragmented policies of the past, in which military securityand economic issues were separated, are no longer acceptable,''Currie said in a letter accompanying the report. ``We mustacknowledge this new reality and act accordingly.''   The report, which dealt with the so-called Pacific rim nations,predicted their emerging economic bloc will be the most powerful bythe end of the century. It noted the U.S. commercial trade deficitwith those countries accounts for two-thirds of the overall U.S.trade deficit.   It called upon the administration to develop a ``coherentpolicy'' for long-term U.S. cooperation with these nations indefense, economics and technological growth, to maintain them asmilitary allies and achieve solid U.S. technological and industrialstrength over the long run.   ``Our comparative industrial, manufacturing, and technologicalstrength has been eroded seriously over the last decade. Thiserosion must be reversed so that we can enter cooperative venturesinvolving technology transfer from a position of strength,'' thepanel wrote.   The panel called for ``a thoughtful, tough-minded approach,'' andrecommended in particular that for U.S.-Japanese relations theremust be a ``mutually beneficial, two-way sharing of technology.''   The report noted Japan's government and industry have workedtogether to establish that nation as a dominant global player inhigh-tech industries by the year 2000.   ``A coherent U.S. policy for defense industrial cooperation isnecessary if problems such as those (that) arose with the FSX are tobe avoided in the future,'' the panel's report stated.   ``U.S. policy must promote better coordination'' among suchagencies as the Pentagon, State Department, CIA, Department ofCommerce, and National Security Council and the Department of Labor,the report said.   The group said the nation lacks a ``policy framework'' to dealwith the complex issue and, among other things, called for theformation of a high-level interagency group to propose such astrategy to the president within six months.</TEXT></DOC>
