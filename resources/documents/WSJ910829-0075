In Chicago, the following day, 10 potentialcandidates took time out of a beautiful Sunday afternoon todiscuss their potential campaigns.   All the potential candidates had one thing in common: Theythink 1992 is the best opportunity they have ever had to wina seat in the House. That is partly a credit to PresidentBush's popularity. It is also the result of hard work by GuyVanderJagt of the National Republican Congressional CampaignCommittee, Reps. Bill Emerson and Rick Santorum, and GOP PACChairman Bo Callaway, all of whom are actively engaged inattracting Republican House candidates.   In 1948, the Democrats picked up 75 seats in a closelycontested presidential election. A similar gain in 1992 wouldgive Republicans a 241-seat majority and make Bob Michelspeaker of the House.   Rep. Newt Gingrich (R., Ga.)   Washington</TEXT></DOC>
