Carbon dioxide is the principal gas responsible for the expected``greenhouse effect'' warming of the earth. It is an inevitablebyproduct of combustion of all fossil fuels.   Applied Energy Services Inc. of Arlington, Va., said it wouldgive $2 million to a project aimed at planting almost 52 milliontrees in plantations and small farmer woodlots.   The Peace Corps, the U.S. Agency for International Development,CARE and the government of Guatemala also will contribute cash orservices to the project.   Applied Energy Services is building a coal-fired 180-megawattplant at Uncasville, Conn., which will sell electricity undercontract to Connecticut Light andamp; Power Co. when it goes into servicein about a year.   Though a mature forest neither absorbs nor releases carbondioxide on balance, the widespread destruction of tropical forestsand burning of their wood probably accounts for about a fifth ofall releases of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, said Gus Speth,president of the World Resources Institute, a Washington-basedenvironmental research organization which helped Applied EnergyServices organize the reforestation project.   A growing forest, on the other hand, absorbs large amounts ofcarbon dioxide in producing woody tissue.   Applied Energy Services said it estimated that two square milesof forest would be needed to offset each megawatt of capacityduring the life of the project. The project area in Guatemala isslightly larger than the 360 square miles this rule of thumb wouldrequire.</TEXT></DOC>
