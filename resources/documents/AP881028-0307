For most of the past week, trading of industrial bonds _ debtsecurities issued mainly by the nation's bread-and-buttermanufacturing companies _ has been at a virtual standstill asinvestors ponder the fallout from the recent spate of megadeals.   These investors, which include many large pension funds orinsurance companies, are avoiding industrial bonds for fear thecompanies that issue them _ despite their size _ might be futuretakeover targets or aggressors, like RJR Nabisco Inc. or Kraft Inc.And there are no buyers for the bonds investors currently own.   ``Takeovers have been going on for several years, but what haschanged is ... that more companies seem to be targets and largercompanies thought of as immune to takeovers aren't. That's causingquite a stir in the marketplace,'' noted Harold Goldberg, chairmanof the corporate rating committee of Moody's Investors Service.   Two of the biggest buyouts in corporate history have beenproposed in the last two weeks. Philip Morris Cos. Inc. proposed an$11.4 billion takeover of Kraft, which responded with a proposal fora $13.6 billion restructuring of its own. The investment firmKohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. made a record $20.3 billion offer forRJR Nabisco after management proposed taking the company private ina $17 billion leveraged buyout.   Earlier in the month, Pillsbury Co. received a surprise $5.23billion takeover offer from the British conglomerate GrandMetropolitan PLC.   What troubles bondholders is that these deals will be financedprimarily by borrowed money, first through private placement, suchas banks, and eventually through the public credit markets. Thatwill result in higher levels of debt than traditionaly have beenconsidered prudent and increase the likelihood that previous debtmay not be paid off.   That especially worries Marshall Front, an economist at theChicago investment and mutual-fund management firm Stein Roe andamp;Farnham, who says the possibility of an economic recession wouldfurther exacerbate the problem.   Not surprisingly, the price of existing bonds of Philip Morris,RJR Nabisco and Kraft have tumbled, falling as much as $200 per$1,000 face amount. Prices of other industrial bonds also have takena beating, while yields, which move inversely, have shot up.   ``The best way to characterize the market right now is thateveryone is pretty much in a holding pattern,'' explained James J.Drury, a corporate bond analyst with Prudential-Bache SecuritiesInc. ``Nobody's ready to dive in the pool. People are just stickingtheir toes in the water.''   The hostile climate surrounding industrial bonds also hasdiscouraged corporations from bringing to market any further issues,thereby forcing them to put off various projects and business plans,or find cash elsewhere.   ``What's on the bond calendar? There really isn't any calendar,''said Drury.   One big casualty this past week was a $1.15 billion offering ofFederated Department Stores Inc. Underwriters led by First BostonCorp. decided to postpone the issue while they ``restructure thetransaction.''   First Boston may have wished it did the same with a $300 millionissue of Eastman Kodak Co., which came to market about two weeks agoand reportedly remains largely unsold.   Concern about the surge in corporate takeovers has even carriedover into the Eurobond market, which trades debt securities issuedby U.S. and foreign companies outside their boundaries, analystssaid.   They said the yields on some investment-grade corporate bonds hadbeen quoted in the Eurobond market as much as three percentagepoints above U.S. Treasury bonds with comparable maturities, almostthe same spread as high-yield, low-rated ``junk'' bonds.   Goldberg of Moody's said his company will ``add a measure ofconservatism in how we look at credits where we feel there is asusceptibility to `event risk,''' a term Wall Street uses todescribe things like recapitalizations or LBOs.   Both Moody's and Standard andamp; Poor's Corp., another majordebt-rating service, already take these factors into considerationand try to predict which companies could become takeover targets.One giveaway is a high cash flow or underperforming stock.   But Goldberg said, ``We'll be taking a harder look at anyone whofeels they might be subject to a special event.''   Corporate bond analysts say the only way to revive interest inthe market is by giving bondholders more protection from eventrisks, which traditionally have enriched shareholders.   One way of doing that is by attaching agreements to bond issuesthat protect bond investments from possible buyouts and ensure thatno corporate transaction could benefit shareholders at the expenseof bondholders.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Weekend Editions Oct. 29-30</NOTE></DOC>
