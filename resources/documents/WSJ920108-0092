The jurisprudential issueis called &quot;pre-emption,&quot; but the key to understanding thecase is who filed legal arguments urging the justices toinvite these lawsuits into court.   Pro-plaintiff briefs were filed by plaintiff lawyersthemselves, under guises that included the Association ofTrial Lawyers of America and Trial Lawyers for PublicJustice. Contingency-fee lawyers made it clear that theywould be happy to divvy up the net worth of Liggett Group,Philip Morris and the other tobacco companies with theirclients, who are typically people who smoked despite knowingbetter.</LP><TEXT>   These cases are about two social ills. Cigarettes aren'tcalled coffin nails for nothing, but tort reform insists onasking whether any sensible legal system can let people whobought a product knowing it was dangerous then sue themanufacturer for agreeing to sell it to them.   The smoking case before the Supreme Court, Cipollone v.Liggett Group, is the only one where a jury ever awardeddamages -- and the $400,000 a New Jersey jury awarded wasreversed by an appeals court because the federal judge failedto let jurors consider that Rose Cipollone might haveunderstood the risks of smoking.   Indeed, the real issue here is whether state and federaljudges can dismiss these cases before they go to trial. Thisis because the last best hope for plaintiff lawyers is tokeep the cases in court even if there's little chance ofdamages. These lawyers know that if they can bring enoughcases in enough courts, tobacco companies might pay themsettlements to go away as a cheaper alternative to the fullcosts of litigation. This abuse -- plus the spectacle oflawyers recruiting the mourning families of deceased smokersto be plaintiffs -- makes this case a good argument forrequiring the losing party or the lawyers to pay the otherside's legal bills.   The reigning legal ethos dictates that the Supreme Courtwill not rule on whether these lawsuits make any sense.Instead, the case will be argued under the doctrine ofpre-emption, which will determine if federal rules pre-emptstate lawsuits.   The notorious vagueness of pre-emption probably explainswhy the justices apparently deadlocked in a 4-4 vote inOctober when Cipollone was argued the first time. WhenClarence Thomas was confirmed, the other justices decided hecould decide the case, which will be reargued Monday for hisbenefit.   Nice trick to play on a new colleague. Justice Thomas willquickly see that the legal issue is complicated by fuzzydrafting of a federal statute. The possibility of suchirresponsible action by Congress will not shock JusticeThomas, who will also be amused to see Laurence Tribe arguingthe case for the plaintiff. (Mr. Tribe, the Harvard lawprofessor, must not worry about Justice Thomas's judicialtemperament: Mr. Tribe was a chief adviser to Joseph Bidenduring the Thomas confirmation battle and said JusticeThomas's views of natural law threatened &quot;the fate ofself-government in the U.S.&quot;)   The issue directly before the court is whether the FederalCigarette Labeling and Advertising Act of 1965 blockslawsuits by smokers in state courts based onmisrepresentations of the risks of smoking. The law calleditself a &quot;comprehensive federal program&quot; for cigarettelabeling and advertising. The goals were to inform the publicof health risks from smoking and to protect &quot;commerce and thenational economy&quot; from being &quot;impeded by diverse, nonuniformand confusing&quot; rules in the 50 states. It prohibited anyrules &quot;imposed under state law with respect to theadvertising or promotion&quot; of cigarettes.   The doctrine of pre-emption is ambiguous enough thatdespite the absurdity of these lawsuits, the result in thecase is hard to predict. For anyone interested in thedetails, here's a short tutorial:   Pre-emption can be express or implied. Express pre-emptionis stated in the law itself, which Congress rarely takes thetrouble to do. Implied pre-emption can be either fieldpre-emption or conflict pre-emption. Field pre-emption iswhen Congress makes it clear that a law is supposed to takeup the entire regulatory field. Then there are two kinds ofconflict pre-emption: impossibility, where it's impossible tocomply with both federal and state requirements, andfrustration, where state law frustrates the federal purpose.   The tobacco companies say it makes no sense for thefederal government to insist on warnings, then havestate-court juries award damages because the companiesprinted federally mandated warnings, not whatever warningjurors might have preferred. Justice Antonin Scalia seemed toagree during the October argument when he said, &quot;It alsoseems a little absurd to think that Congress said, `You can'tdo this unless of course you do it through the courts.'&quot;   Lawyers for the plaintiff said liability is no problembecause the tobacco companies always have the &quot;option ofdoing nothing other than paying damage awards.&quot; In otherwords, tough luck if the defendants have to comply withfederal rules that lead to state damage awards. There is alsothe stronger argument that if Congress meant to pre-emptlawsuits for damages, it should have said so very explicitly.   Shorn of legal language, the best argument for the tobaccocompanies is that even law can't be so stupid as to allowjuries to punish compliance with federal rules. Thecompromise that Congress reached -- that tobacco could besold so long as firms printed the surgeon general's warnings-- would be frustrated if state courts forced tobacco off themarket through ruinous litigation.   Markets will watch this case closely. Calvert Crary, alitigation analyst with Martin Simpson andamp; Co., thinks thejustices would need a new &quot;blunderbuss pre-emption doctrine&quot;to rule for the tobacco companies, but also says &quot;juries arejust not ready to award huge damages.&quot; Still, letting thesecases into court would be a boon for lawyers. The ChicagoBoard of Trade, which recently began trading pollutionrights, will be disappointed to learn that American BarAssociation rules prohibit sale of contingency-fee futures.   One clear lesson is that Congress needs to be clearerabout what it intends to pre-empt. Until Congress assumes theaccountability that comes with making itself clear, thecourts will have to grapple with who can sue for what inwhich courts.   Juries are wise enough to agree that personalresponsibility means that tobacco users do not deservedamages. The justices should also take some professionalresponsibility to keep contingency-fee smoke out of thenation's courtrooms.   ---                Warnings Not Clear Enough?
