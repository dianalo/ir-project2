That taskis tough enough, given soft markets and entrenchedcompetition in many of its main businesses. But at everyturn, Manville is still dogged by the financial problems ofthe Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust, which was setup to compensate asbestos victims.</LP><TEXT>   In a landmark agreement that got Manville out ofbankruptcy court, the company gave the trust $2.5 billion ofassets, mostly stock. It also promised to pay the trust $75million annually beginning in August 1991, plus 20% of itsannual net income from 1992 until all claims are paid. Itcontends that it has no further legal obligation.   Others aren't so sure. &quot;Manville is basically a very soundcompany with good management,&quot; says Paul Kleinaitis, ananalyst at Duff andamp; Phelps in Chicago. &quot;But the unknown is thetrust. No one knows what the ultimate liability will be.&quot;   Meanwhile, the memory of asbestos lingers on, even ascompany officials swear that Manville's reputation amongcustomers wasn't damaged. The company has became a born-againenvironmentalist. A health, safety and environment committeeindependent of management audits all operations and policies.Scrubbers are being added to smokestacks, and waste sites andwater-storage ponds are being brought into compliance withgovernment regulations.   The company is clearly wary of the power ofproduct-liability law. It is the only major company thatstamps a warning label on its two-by-fours and other woodproducts. (Wood dust can harm lungs.) And when theInternational Agency for Research on Cancer said diatomaceousearth, which is used as a filler and as a filter, might causecancer, Manville added a warning label to the product eventhough that action stirred customer resistance, especially incancer-wary Japan. Manville stood its ground as sales slippedand, eventually, regained prior levels.   &quot;We want to be way out front in safety and health issues,&quot;says Richard A. Kashnow, recently named president of the newengineered-products group. &quot;We want to set some standards forethical behavior in those regards.&quot;   Image-makers say this kind of aggressive environmentalmakeover is the only way to reinvent a company whose name hasbecome synonymous with health problems. &quot;You can't justchange the name, you can't just redesign the logo andeverything will be all right,&quot; says Gershon Kekst, a New Yorkpublic-relations executive (not in Manville's employ).&quot;You've got to come to grip with reality.&quot;   However, another reality -- the fact that the trust isrunning out of cash -- keeps intruding. Earlier this month, astate court judge and a federal judge presiding over 450asbestos lawsuits stemming from 1940s employment at theBrooklyn Navy Yard asked, in an unusual joint memorandum,whether the trust's overseers had considered going back tobankruptcy court to alleviate a cash crunch that has impairedits ability to pay claims. As the New York judges interpretedthe law, the bankruptcy court could choose to lift aninjunction barring asbestos victims from suing Manvilledirectly. They also suggested that the court could increasethe company's payments to the trust. They even hinted thatthey might appoint a receiver for the trust if it didn't workout its problems.   The resulting legal uncertainty rattled Manvilleinvestors, who promptly deluged its investor-relationsdepartment with calls. Although the stock fell just 50 centsa share to $6.50 over the two days following the hearing, 20%of the common shares not held by the trust changed hands.(The trust owns 50% of the common, which closed at $7 a shareyesterday in composite trading on the New York StockExchange.)   In response to the judges' questions, the trust filed amemorandum in court Tuesday arguing that reopening thereorganization plan &quot;would jeopardize the very structure ofthe plan.&quot; Anything raising uncertainty about Manville'sliability, the trust added, reduces the value of Manvillestock and therefore the trust's assets. The trust also saidthat &quot;no mismanagement has occurred nor is there an emergencywarranting the drastic measure of receivership as suggestedby the court,&quot; adding that only 8% of the money spent by thetrust has gone to pay its own costs and its attorney fees.The rest -- about $750 million -- has gone or been earmarkedto pay claims. The judges will respond to the memorandum at ahearing tomorrow.   Manville executives and bankruptcy experts doubt that theinjunction will be overturned. Court-approved reorganizationplans are rarely modified, especially so late in the game.Furthermore, says Richard Von Wald, Manville's generalcounsel, &quot;If the injunction is challenged, we'll all bespending a lot of money on legal fees that should be going toplaintiffs.&quot;   The trust has already doled out to some 22,000 claimantsmost of the $800 million-plus in cash it had when it started,and it can't sell its common-stock holdings until year end.It rejected as too low a company offer to buy back thetrust's preferred stock for $500 million; instead, the trustplans to borrow assets to tide it over until Manville cashstarts flowing next year. Borrowing, however, has been mademore difficult by the New York judges' statements and thepublicity they received, the trust said in its memo to thejudges.   &quot;Everybody knew that we would have no income in 1990,&quot;says Marianna Smith, the trust's executive director.&quot;Everybody knew this was going to be troublesome.&quot;   But some plaintiffs' attorneys think that the trust paidout too much to early claimants -- the average settlement hasbeen about $42,000 -- and to attorneys. So far, 152,000claims have been filed, and at least 3,000 more are expected.With cash short, victims filing this year won't be paid until2004, and lawyers are suing the trust rather than settling.&quot;That means the trust ends up spending more money onlitigation and less to pay claims,&quot; says Stanley J. Levy,chairman of the plaintiffs' committee during the bankruptcyproceedings and now a Manville director.   Even before the New York judges' action, plaintiffs'attorneys were contemplating a challenge to the bankruptcyplan and to the injunction against suing Manville. &quot;IfManville has to put more of its profits into the trust, maybethat's what has to happen,&quot; says Perry Weitz, an attorneyrepresenting 2,000 asbestos claimants.   Renegotiating the bankruptcy agreement would certainlyimpede the ambitious plans Mr. Stephens started sketchingback in 1986, when he took command of the shattered company.Although it was still solvent, the compounding liability riskfrom asbestos-related lawsuits had driven Manville intobankruptcy court in 1982. Manville sold its asbestos minesand quit making asbestos products, which once produced nearlyhalf its operating profit.   The company used its time in bankruptcy court to expandits fiberglass operations and its 50%-owned platinum mine andto absorb newly purchased Olinkraft Inc., a largeforest-products company. It also slashed its costs, shrinkingits payroll from 30,000 to 17,000, reducing the ranks ofsenior vice presidents from 12 to five and trimming its jetfleet from five planes to two. Nearly $500 million was sunkinto money-saving capital improvements, mostly to updateequipment. Employees pitched in: At one plant, maintenanceworkers improved a wire mesh that controls the flow ofmaterials through a paper machine and saved $40,000 a month.   Manville emerged from Chapter 11 late in 1988 and, for1989, reported net income of $197 million -- its thirdconsecutive year of record earnings. And it has a $1 billionwar chest of cash and unused credit lines with which toexpand operations and buy new businesses. Already, theforest-products group has acquired a beverage-carton businessin the U.S. and paper mills and corrugated paperboard plantsin Brazil as part of an ambitious plan to double its size infive to seven years. The engineered-products group isbuilding a $65 million fiberglass plant in Waterville, Ohio.   &quot;This is a $2.2 billion company that has transformeditself around new products and markets,&quot; says Mr. Kashnow,the group's president.   However, Manville still needs to modernize its plants.Most of its fiberglass spinning plants, for instance, operateon energy-gulping technology dropped by competitors 20 yearsago. The company will spend much of its 1990capital-improvements budget of $300 million to upgrade thosefacilities, Mr. Kashnow says.   Meanwhile, Brazil's tough anti-inflation program issqueezing profits at Manville's sizable forest-products andcorrugated-container operations there. New machines underconstruction by U.S. and Canadian rivals threaten to floodthe U.S. paperboard market by early 1991, and continuedsluggishness in the construction and automobile markets willlimit 1990 earnings.   The company also needs to regain the competitive edge itlost while mired in bankruptcy court. &quot;We'd lost good people,customer support and new-product momentum,&quot; says RonaldMathewson, newly named president of Manville's buildingproducts group. Mr. Mathewson's line of products, which oncenumbered in the hundreds, has been reduced to non-asbestosbuilding insulation and roofing materials; the rest were soldoff. Now, he plans some aggressive buying.   The new Ohio fiberglass plant illustrates Manville's hopesand fears. Although the company expects to make up for losttime with technology licensed from Nippon Electric Glass, Mr.Kashnow acknowledges that major players such as Owens-CorningFiberglas Corp. and PPG Industries Inc. gained majorfootholds while Manville was reorganizing. Infiber-reinforced plastics -- the burgeoning business forplastic clones to replace metal parts -- Manville must buildits business slowly, Mr. Kashnow says. He will concentrate onmarket niches and custom applications, such as the emergingair-filters market and the undeveloped fiberglasswall-covering market, rather than challenge the leaders inthe $500 million commodity glass-fibers market.   As Thomas Johnson, president of the forest-products unit,puts it, Manville's cost-cutting efforts may have made it alow-cost producer, but that &quot;is simply the ante to play thegame. It doesn't guarantee you can stay in the game.&quot;   So marketing also is under scrutiny. Mr. Mathewson of theconstruction group notes, for example, that the same Manvillebuilding-insulation salesmen now call on contractors at muddyconstruction projects, buyers in retail home-improvementcenters and architects nestled in fancy design centers. &quot;Weare a production-driven company. We don't think markets andmarketing,&quot; Mr. Mathewson admits.   By September, he vows, that will change. A specialist willadvise retailers on ways to sell Manville insulation; anotherwill work with architects to get them to specify it. Thecompany's computer system is being reprogrammed to askquestions more closely related to customer service. &quot;Forexample, it will focus on how many on-time deliveries we madetoday instead of how many pieces did we produce,&quot; Mr.Mathewson says.   Despite such efforts, he acknowledges that the company isstruggling to regain lost business. &quot;There were a lot ofcustomers who said, `I'll stick with you, but I can't let yoube my major supplier,'&quot; he says. While Manville was mired inthe bankruptcy proceedings, Owens-Corning took the lead inthe retail insulation business through aggressiveadvertising.   Though not disclosing market shares, Mr. Mathewson sayssome lost customers are returning. Payless Cashways Inc., aretailer based in Kansas City, is in negotiations to restoreManville as an insulation supplier. The chain, which nowcarries only Owens-Corning products, dropped Manville sixyears ago.   Mr. Stephens expects old wounds to heal. &quot;There were lotsof critics who said this company couldn't perform,&quot; he says.&quot;But $1 billion in claims have been settled and the plan isworking and the company is performing above expectations.&quot;   Yet he concedes that the healing process will be lengthy.&quot;We're used to seeing unbelievable problems solved in 30minutes,&quot; the length of an episode on TV, he complains. &quot;It'sgoing to take far longer than 30 minutes to solve problemsthat were years in the making.&quot;   --- Manville: Staying Alive in a Sea of Troubles                                                                                                                     Asbestos-Dependent in '76...                                                                                                             1976 net sales: $1.3 billion, by business segment                                                                                                        Thermal Insulation                      31% Pipe products                           17% Mining and minerals                     14% Roofing products                        14% General building products               13% Industrial products                     11%                                                                                                                Manville Is Focused on Building Products...                                                                                                            1989 net sales: $2.2 billion, by business segment                                                                                                        Fiberglass                               42% Specialty products                       35% Forest products                          23%</TEXT></DOC>
