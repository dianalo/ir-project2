The analyst, William Arkin, said the evidence showed that U.S.ships ignored Japan's ban on nuclear weapons during the Vietnam Warera, and he said he will publish evidence that the Navy continuesto carry nuclear weapons on ships in allied ports. The Navydeclined comment.   Arkin and an associate, Joshua Handler of Greenpeace, said theirresearch had established that many other nuclear devices have beenlost in the sea _ 48 nuclear warheads and 11 reactors, ``themajority of them Soviet.''   He said there was little danger of detonation from theone-megaton bomb, which has a force of 1 million tons of TNT,although he said the materials do threaten the environment as theydeteriorate over time.   The Navy acknowledged the 1965 accident more than 15 years afterit occurred but revealed few details such as which ship wasinvolved, where it was destined and where it was bound. It didconcede in 1986 that the incident was classified as among its twomost serious nuclear accidents.   The new evidence shows the accident occurred aboard an aircraftcarrier that was steaming past Okinawa and bound for the Japaneseport of Yokosuka after war duty off the Vietnam coast.   In 1981, the Navy revealed that the mishap occurred on Dec. 5,1965; involved an A-4 attack jet loaded with one nuclear bomb andtook place ``more than 500 miles from land ... at sea in thePacific.''   The Navy said the jet ``rolled off the elevator of a U.S.aircraft carrier and fell into the sea'' and that the pilot, planeand bomb were all lost.      Arkin said recently declassified documents reveal the incidentoccurred aboard the USS Ticonderoga bound for Japan after adeployment off Vietnam, and that the bomb was a one megaton B-43hydrogen device. It was lost in international waters about 80 milesfrom the closest point of the Okinawa island chain and only about200 miles east of the heavily populated island of Okinawa Arkinsaid.      ``This accident occurred 500 miles from land alright, but theNavy forgot that Japan was between the ship and China,'' saidArkin, an expert on nuclear matters with the Institute for PolicyStudies, a liberal think tank.   A newly declassified memo described the strategic mission of theTiconderoga at the time of the accident as including ``thecapability to launch a nuclear strike when and where directed bythe president.'' The A-4 was the Navy's main deep-strike aircraftat the time, and an undisclosed number on each U.S. carrier wouldalways be equipped with the B-43 hydrogen bomb, Arkin said.   Japan bans nuclear weapons. It says U.S. ships or planes cannotbring nuclear arms into Japan without prior consultations with thegovernment, and there have been no such consultations. The UnitedStates refuses to confirm or deny the presence of nuclear weaponsin specific locations.   Arkin, who is about to publish a study on serious navalaccidents around the world along with the environmental groupGreenpeace, said the mishap demonstrates ``that nuclear weaponswere carried on aircraft carriers during the Vietnam War, somethingthat no U.S. administration has ever admitted.''   He said he assumed that U.S. ships still carry nuclear weaponsin Japanese waters, although he provided no details. He told a newsconference that he would issue a report next year providingevidence that U.S. ships regularly carry nuclear weapons intoallied ports, including those in Japan.   The Navy declined comment on Arkin's findings, beyond repeatingits standard policy of never confirming nor denying the presence ofnuclear weapons on its ships.   Japan, the only nation ever attacked with nuclear weapons,remains very sensitive about nuclear arms questions. The report wasprominently featured in Japanese newspapers and on television.Leaders of anti-war and anti-nuclear groups and opponents of theU.S. military presence on Okinawa immediately issued denunciations.   At the time of the accident, Okinawa was under U.S. control. Itwas returned to Japan in 1972, 27 years after Japan's defeat inWorld War II.   Besides its 1981 admission of the accident, the Navy hasn'tcommented on the mishap beyond a January 1986 report describing itas one of only two so-called ``Broken Arrow'' accidents everexperienced. Broken Arrow is the code name for the most seriousnuclear accident. The other Broken Arrow was the 1968 loss of thesubmarine Scorpion in the Atlantic.   ``The Navy kept the true details of this accident a secret notonly because it demonstrates their disregard for the treatystipulations of foreign governments, but because of the questionsit raises about nuclear weapons aboard ships in Vietnam,'' Arkinsaid.   Arkin asserted that the United States sidesteps the Japanese banby arguing that a temporary transit or port call by a ship does notamount to the ``introduction'' of nuclear weapons and thusconsultations are unnecessary.   The researcher said there was probably little danger of the lostbomb exploding.   ``But we do think there is a threat to the environment,'' headded. ``Over time, the pressure, water circulation and corrosionare likely to lead to the release of radioactivity.''   The estimate of the number of other lost nuclear devices iscontained in Arkin's study, ``Neptune Papers 3,'' describing navalaccidents from the end of World War II through last year. Arkinsaid that 48 nuclear warheads and 11 reactors, most of them Soviet,were ``sitting on the bottom of the ocean.'' The figure includestwo reactors aboard the Soviet Mike class submarine that sank lastmonth in the Norwegian Sea.</TEXT></DOC>
