But, she added, ``we take exceptionto the prime minister's assertions that such action is justified bythe United States' refusal to consult with New Zealand'' inaccordance with terms of the ANZUS pact.   ANZUS, created in 1951 as a defense alliance among the UnitedStates, Australia and New Zealand, has been crippled since theUnited States suspended guarantees for New Zealand's defense in1986 over the Pacific nation's ban of ships carrying nuclearweapons. U.S. policy is neither to confirm nor deny the existenceof nuclear weapons on its vessels.   Even if New Zealand does pull out, ``ANZUS would continue toexist as the foundation of our important and active securityrelationship with Australia,'' said a State Department statement.   ``We continue to hope that New Zealand will reassess itsanti-nuclear policies, which would enable it to return to fullparticipation'' in ANZUS, the statement said.   The rift between the two countries led the United States to stopsharing intelligence information with New Zealand and to cool itsdiplomatic relations with the embassy here.   Speaking at Yale University Monday, Lange said his country'ssecurity relationship with the United States is a ``dead letter.''   But the State Department disputed that view, saying that ``theU.S. continues to maintain a security relationship with NewZealand, albeit much diminished from the close military andintelligence ties existing prior to the current dispute.''   Observers here have noted that despite Lange's outspokencomments at Yale and in several interviews he has granted sincearriving for a six-day visit, he has also emphasized that overallrelations between the two countries are good. Lange has stressedthat trade and tourism have grown.   Responding to that tone, the State Department said ``the UnitedStates and New Zealand now enjoy a constructive relationship on arange of issues in which we share common goals and objectives.   ``We regret, however, that the prime minister's remarks did notmore constructively address our difference of opinion on issuesraised by New Zealand's anti-nuclear policies,'' it said.   Lange said Monday he would not come to Washington because theU.S. administration had made it clear he was not welcome until hisgovernment renounced its anti-nuclear policies.</TEXT></DOC>
