Government officials said Wednesday the L-100 plane went downMonday night in southeastern Angola after a flight from a militarybase in Zaire.   The crash occurred just two days after the Bush administrationlodged a protest with the Soviet Embassy over an abortive attemptto deliver Soviet weapons to leftist rebels in El Salvador.   That shipment was foiled when the Cessna aircraft carrying theweaponry from Nicaragua crashed in eastern El Salvador.   The administration reacted indignantly to the perceived Sovietinvolvement in support of the Salvadoran insurgency, but there waslittle U.S. comment Wednesday night after the disclosure of thecrash in Angola.   The State Department acknowledged that there was a crash in aremote area of Angola and that among the passengers on board therewere four Americans.   Other government officials, insisting on anonymity, said all theAmericans on board were killed and that some of the accompanyingAngolan rebels survived.   The sources were unable to identify the dead Americans but aDefense Department official on Tuesday reportedly notified thefamily of James Spessard, 31, of Hagerstown, Md., that he had diedin a plane crash ``near Zaire.''   A family member told the Hagerstown Morning Herald that thePentagon official had offered very little information about thecrash.   Spessard is survived by his wife, Deborah, and two small boys.   The resupply mission from Zaire to Angola cannot be discussedpublicly by the administration because the United States providesassistance on a confidential basis.   One source said the leak of the information originated withmembers of Congress opposed to U.S. military involvement in Angola.   The disclosure highlighted the continuing differences betweenMoscow and Washington on some Third World conflicts as PresidentBush and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev prepare for theirsummit meeting in the Mediterranean.   Meanwhile, the French newspaper Le Monde reported Wednesday thatthe Soviet Union has told Nicaragua and Cuba to stop supplying armsto the Salvadoran rebels. The Soviet ambassador to Nicaragua gavethe instructions at a secret meeting Tuesday in Managua, Nicaragua,the newspaper said.   The newspaper said the Soviets hoped to gain points withWashington in the summit by ordering the halt in support to theleftist rebels.   Angola, whose government is run by Marxists, is one of severalregional conflicts in which the superpowers have been armingopposite sides.   The United States has been providing covert aid to the UNITArebels in Angola since 1986 while the Angolan government has beenbacked by Soviet weaponry and Cuban troops since the country gainedindependence in 1975.   Hope for a settlement in Angola rose last December when Cubaagreed to withdraw its 50,000 troops from Angola over a 27-monthperiod as part of a broader agreement.   The Angolan government and the rebel movement agreed to acease-fire this past June but it broke down in August.   The Bush administration has been attempting to promote nationalreconciliation in Angola through free elections, but thus far therehas been little basis for serious negotiations.   The country has been ravaged by long years of warfare. RandallRobinson, a critic of U.S. military involvement, said Wednesday theUnited States has turned Angola into a ``graveyard.''   It is not known exactly how much money the United Statesprovides the Angolan rebels because the figures are secret, butcongressional sources estimate the amount at about $40 millionannually.   Bush administration officials have said the Angolan governmenthas shown little interest in engaging in serious peace negotiations.   The United States has been using Zaire as a staging area forresupplying the Angolan rebels but Zairean President Mobutu SeseSeko suspended his government's cooperation with that effort inJune when he became a peace mediator.   Mobutu, during a visit to Washington in early October, agreed tothe resumption of the resupply flights under U.S. pressure. TheMonday flight is said to have been the first since June.</TEXT></DOC>
