My how Mr. Bovard -- the Pied Piper of Privatization -- loves to ignore facts. The facts are that the Postal Service in fiscal 1986:    --Achieved a net income of more than $305 million, marking the fourth time in the past five years and the fifth in the past 10 it has been in the black.    --Established delivery performance records in six of the nine categories of mail measured against standards -- and tied a seventh.    --Increased use of automated equipment to help process a record 147.4 billion pieces of mail.    --Launched a more businesslike, customer-oriented approach to a growing competitive environment through a nationwide management restructuring.    The most outrageous Bovard charge is that the Postal Service &quot;is a mess,&quot; mired in inefficiencies and delivery failures.    Changes brought about by a nationwide restructuring of the service have resulted in strong, positive customer reaction. Delivery performance in 1986 was the best ever and other service improvements, including extending the window hours in 3,000 different offices, have been put in place and are expanding.    Recent national tracking studies reveal that the public knows that there is, in fact, a &quot;new&quot; Postal Service and that it is working to the public's advantage. Record-high percentages of those who send (56%) or receive (57%) mail (and that is virtually everyone) believe they are getting excellent or very good service. Overall, more than 84% have a favorable or very favorable impression of the Postal Service.    Postmaster General Preston R. Tisch never &quot;raised the prospect of a nickel hike&quot; in postage rates in 1988. The possible need for a rate increase is being explored but no specific amounts have been discussed or even alluded to.    Frank S. Johnson Jr.   Asst. Postmaster General   Washington   ---   Why on earth should management rise the specter of privatization in negotiations with the postal unions? Mr. Bovard cites an evaluation that alleges that letter carriers waste almost one and one-half hours a day. This is nonsense. While procedures and attitudes may vary from location to location, the carriers with whom I work often skip breaks or abbreviate their half-hour lunch period in order to complete their routes on time.    Many of us at the &quot;New Postal Service,&quot; a phrase that Mr. Bovard seems to find hard to swallow, would argue that threats by management to dismember our organization would not serve management, labor nor our customers. We would also assert that the way to improve service is not through confrontation, but rather through a cooperative effort by management and workers in order to make the improvements we all want.    This past Christmas season our office cut overtime to carriers significantly. This was accomplished jointly, by management's increasingly efficient use of labor, and a performance by our mail handlers and carriers that reaffirmed their commitment to provide our customers with the quality service they deserve. The problems raised by Mr. Bovard will not be solved by slashing the wages of dedicated postal employees, nor will the public be served by the privatization of its Postal Service.    Many Americans grow weary of private business's strident cries for deregulation, privatization of government services, and the opening of the floodgates of free enterprise. We need only look around to see the results such policies can inflict. Try to keep to your travel schedule if it includes a flight on our newly deregulated airlines. Our nation's Postal Service has the enormous task of processing more than 140 billion pieces of mail annually, and for the most part does an excellent job.    There is more at stake here than another government sale of its assets. &quot;Sanctity of the mail&quot; is more than a slogan at the post office. We rigorously maintain our customers' right to privacy of communication and the attendant freedom of speech that our present postal system ensures. I find it appalling that some would have us jeopardize these basic rights in order to slice up our postal system like some grocery-store pie and serve it up to the highest bidder.
