<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-65-0551 </DOCNO><TEXT>A number of fiber optic-based devices have been developed for bioanalyses,including probes for performing fluoroimmunoassays. Single-fiber probespossess the advantages of good signal collection efficiency and smallsize, but suffer from high optical background levels. Rare earth metalchelate fluorescent labels for immunoassays have extremely long lifetimesand permit the effective use of time resolved detection to reduce theoptical background and, thereby, improve detectability. The instrumentationand methodologies associated with the use of fiber optics-based timeresolved fluorimetry will be described. The limit of detection for Eu-2-naphthoyltrifluoroacetoneis nearly three orders of magnitude lower than for the most common fluorescentlabel, fluorescein isothiocyanate. Commercially available Eu-chelatelabeled reagents are used to demonstrate the potential utility of timeresolved fluorimetry for fiber optics-based immunoassays.</TEXT></DOC>
