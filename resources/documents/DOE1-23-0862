This paper describes the fuel cycles understudy, examines their economic status and cost goals, and addresses technicallychallenging areas where major improvements are required to yield cost-competitivefuel products. The technologies described are projected to be ready forprivate-sector development and commercial use in the mid-to long-term.The technical and economic goals presented are based on current informationand are subject to periodic review and revision.</TEXT></DOC>
