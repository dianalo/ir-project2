CarlosVides Casanova told reporters Monday.   Duarte should not extend his term to accommodate the rebelproposal for elections in September, Vides said at this seasideresort, where five Central American presidents began a two-daysummit Monday.   The insurgents issued the proposal on Jan. 24. Duarte said thefollowing day that he would not remain in power under anycircumstances beyond June 1, when his term ends.   The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front said it wouldparticipate in the election if the balloting is delayed from March19 to September and certain security conditions are met.   The rebels, pitted in a 9-year-old war against the U.S.-backedgovernment, previously had rejected the five national elections heldthis decade as anti-democratic and part of a U.S.-sponsoredcounterinsurgency campaign.   The government has described postponement of the election asunconstitutional.   Asked Monday if the elections could be postponed until September,Vides said, ``They cannot.''   Asked if acceptance of the plan could divide the armed forces, hesaid: ``That danger exists. Then the entire democratic process thathas cost so much could be broken.''   A broad spectrum of political parties and labor organizations hassaid last week that there are constitutional means to postpone theelection _ and the United States has called the rebel proposal apositive step.   Duarte's own Christian Democratic Party has said elections couldbe legally postponed and an interim president named by thelegislature if a political consensus to do so exists.   But the rightist Arena party, which is favored to win theelection, and the armed forces continue to cite what they say areconstitutional injunctions against postponing elections.   ``If the Constitution is violated, we would be serving up on asilver platter an opportunity that could destroy the entiredemocratic process we have worked for,'' said Vides.   Rebel chiefs may visit San Salvador late this week to talk withrepresentatives of the country's political parties, who haveexpressed a willingness to do so.   The war has claimed the lives of 65,000 people.</TEXT></DOC>
