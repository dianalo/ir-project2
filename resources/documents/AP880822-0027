They also called on the Soviet Union to reveal ``missing facts''about its role in the suppression of reform movements throughoutEastern Europe.   The dissidents issued a statement Sunday signed by 115 peoplefrom 25 different organizations in the Soviet Union, Hungary,Czechoslovakia, Poland and East Germany.   Czechoslovakia was invaded Aug. 20-21, 1968, by troops from theSoviet Union and other forces of the Warsaw Pact alliance. Theycrushed reforms by Czechoslovakia's liberal Communist government,ending what is known as the ``Prague Spring.''   The dissidents' statement was released by Palach Press, aLondon-based publication that monitors the Czechoslovak politicalscene.   ``The leaders of the invading countries should publicly denouncethe invasion 20 years ago,'' said the statement.   It also said, ``Slandering of the `Prague Spring' should ceaseand the thousands who were expelled from political, cultural andscientific life should be rehabilitated.   ``The Soviet Union should clarify not only missing facts aboutSoviet-Polish relations, but also its role in the suppression of(East) Berlin workers in 1953, in the Hungarian uprising in 1956,in the suppression of the Czechoslovak democratization in 1968 andin the Polish coup d'etat in 1981,'' the statement said.   The mention of a ``Polish coup'' referrred to the imposition ofmartial law in Poland in December 1981 and banning the next fall ofthe Solidarity free trade union movement.   The invasion of Czechoslovakia ``marked the victory ofreactionary forces throughout the whole region, thus causing thepresent-day crisis of East-Central Europe,'' the statement said.   ``It is the earnest wish of all our nations that the Sovietstate keeps its promise and withdraws its troops from the occupiedcountries,'' it said.   According to Palach Press, Soviets who signed the statementincluded Lev Timofeyev of the Press Club Glasnost andrepresentatives of the International Federation for Human Rights.   It said 13 Hungarian organizations, each represented by twopeople, signed the statement including writers Sandor Csoori,Istvan Csurka and Miklos Haraszti and philosopher Janos Kis.
