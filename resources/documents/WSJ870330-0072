Taft, Taft Broadcasting Co. vice chairman, won a major victory in a campaign to acquire the company after the board voted to conduct negotiations with the group.    Charles S. Mechem Jr., Taft chairman and chief executive officer, said Friday that the board authorized management to hold talks with Theta Corp., the investment group, and to supply it with financial information. As reported previously, the group has proposed to take Taft private in a transaction valued at about $1.38 billion.    Besides Mr. Taft, Theta consists of members of Mr. Taft's family and Narragansett Capital Corp., a Providence, R.I.-based investment firm.    But the board also authorized Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., Taft's financial adviser, to explore other takeover proposals and to furnish similar financial data to other parties interested in buying the company.    Company officials wouldn't identify the other suitors, but industry analysts speculate that there are several interested parties, including Carl Lindner, chairman of American Financial Corp., who holds 16.2% of Taft's common shares.    Mr. Lindner couldn't be reached for comment, but in a recent Securities and Exchange Commission filing, the Cincinnati financier disclosed he has considered making an offer to acquire control of Taft.    Two weeks ago, Theta proposed to take Taft private in a leveraged buyout for more than $150 a share, or about $1.38 billion. In a leveraged buyout, a company is acquired largely through debt that is repaid through sale of the target company's assets or from profits.    That proposal was $5 a share higher than the group's initial bid in early March valued at $145 a share for all of Taft's 9.2 million shares outstanding.    Taft's board rejected the first proposal as inadequate and directed management to explore other financial alternatives.    Since the takeover bid was announced, the company's stock has steadily climbed. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Friday, Taft's stock rose 25 cents to close at $154.75 a share.    In an interview, Mr. Taft said he was pleased with the board's willingness to negotiate. The 46-year-old son of company founder Hulbert Taft Jr. said his group expects to review the information promptly and make a definitive proposal as soon as possible.    The Taft family holds about 12% of the broadcaster. Another major holder is an investment group led by Robert M. Bass of Fort Worth, Texas, with a 24.9% stake.    Taft Broadcasting owns radio, television and cable stations, an entertainment division that produces and distributes television programming and has interests in leisure-time properties. In the nine months ended Dec. 31, Taft had a net loss of $46.5 million, compared with earnings of $33.2 million, or $3.61 a share, a year earlier. The loss for the latest period included a $57.1 million loss related to the sale of independent television stations. Revenue in the nine months increased 11% to $403.4 million. </TEXT></DOC>
