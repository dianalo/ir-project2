Lebanon's factionalism is a far better analog forunderstanding South Africa than is America's blackcivil-rights movement. Seven years of living in SouthernAfrica brought me to use the analogy of America's Indiantribes similarly to make the dynamics comprehensible to myAmerican friends inexperienced in African politicalrealities.   The attempts of black American politicos to exploit NelsonMandela for domestic political purposes have been shamefulbut also somewhat burlesque. The realities of South Africaare now beginning to overwhelm the artificial imagesconstructed for factional advantage in the U.S. and insupport of African National Congress hopes that America mightpull the rug from under the Boer government so that the ANCcould simply move into office -- a scenario perhaps modeledon the perception of America's performance in Vietnam.</LP><TEXT>   The Journal's somewhat contradictory role in helpingconstruct the artificial images should not be overlooked.Despite its very accurate appraisals on the editorial page,the Journal's front-page reporting often reflects the &quot;civilrights&quot; stance properly decried as misleading by the editors.   With such mixed signals emanating from the Journal, thereader must choose between the realities of the &quot;news&quot; andthose of the &quot;opinions.&quot; I personally opt for the opinionpage, which more nearly coincides with my own experience, butit detracts from the Journal's reputation for consistentrealism that it does not speak here with one voice.
