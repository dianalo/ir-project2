The plan aims to retire more than $4 billion of RJR'spoorest-performing below-investment-grade &quot;junk&quot; bonds,according to bankers who have seen the package. It is anattempt to put the RJR buy-out on firmer financial footing inthe face of a crucial deadline for repricing part of thehigh-yield debt used to take the company private.</LP><TEXT>   Money for the plan would be raised from three mainsources: $2.25 billion in fresh bank borrowings by RJR, about$1.5 billion through a preferred-stock sale by RJR, and about$1.5 billion in an equity infusion from the large leveragedbuy-out fund that KKR controls. These proceeds would be usedto retire the junk bonds and pay off $1 billion ofincreasing-rate notes later this year.   An RJR spokesman declined to comment on the restructuringplan.   If the plan succeeds, bankers say, it will impose a moreconservative financial structure on RJR, which has beenhighly indebted since it was acquired by KKR, a leveragedbuy-out firm, 17 months ago. The consumer-products companywould be shielded from a potential debt crisis next spring,but KKR's potential profits would be curtailed.   People close to KKR caution that the plan remains subjectto revision. Even so, bankers say, it is by far the mostdetailed RJR refinancing scheme that KKR and its advisershave presented so far.   Since January, bond-market investors and KKR partners haveworried about RJR's obligations on more than $6 billion oflow-rated junk bonds. By next April, the interest rate onthose bonds must be reset to make them trade at their facevalue. Those bonds have been depressed for months and aretrading now at about 76 cents on the dollar.   At current bond prices, RJR would have to reset thosebonds to an interest rate of about 18.5%, which would chew upmuch of the company's cash flow. These bonds have provedunpopular with many investors, in part because they payinterest in the form of more bonds, rather than in cash.   Bankers say the RJR refinancing plan would largelysidestep the reset quandary. Instead, RJR is proposing to buyback all $2.19 billion outstanding of 14.07% convertiblereset debentures, and about 45%, or $1.95 billion, of 14.07%reset exchange debentures.   Such purchases would be huge news in the junk-bond market,where the RJR issues are bellwethers. &quot;The RJR bonds arestill at a big discount to their value,&quot; one large holder,Howard Marks at Trust Co. of the West, said earlier thisweek. Like many junk-bond investors, Mr. Marks has beenkicking around his own conjectures about how KKR might dealwith the reset issue.   RJR could buy back the bonds either gradually, viaopen-market purchases, or rapidly, via a tender offer at apremium to the market price. As long as the junk bonds remainat big discounts to face value, they are likely to be boughtat market prices. If the bonds soar, though, bank-loanproposals have penciled in the assumption that RJR would payfull face value for the bonds.   Crucial to the success of the RJR refinancing will be theresponse of major U.S. and foreign banks, which are beingasked to lend a further $2.25 billion to the company. Lastyear, in the height of the leveraged lending frenzy, bankslent more than $11 billion to fund the RJR buy-out. Now,however, banks have turned much chillier toward buy-outlending.   RJR's four lead bank lenders, units of ManufacturersHanover Corp., Chase Manhattan Corp., Bankers Trust New YorkCorp. and Citicorp, are expected to lead the new bank loan.It wasn't clear, though, how much help they will get fromJapanese banks, which in 1989 lavished RJR with loans in $500million amounts. &quot;Some Japanese banks are feeling tightlyrestrained about LBO lending,&quot; a Japanese banker said.   Bankers said they are intrigued by another major source offunding for the bond repurchases: an approximately $1.5billion issue of convertible preferred stock by RJR. Bankerssaid they expect the preferred will yield about 9% or 10%. Italso would be convertible into RJR common stock at a price ofabout $10 a share, bankers said.   Traditional investors may find the preferred stock, whichpays dividends in cash instead of paper, much more to theirliking than the junk bonds it replaces. Its issuance alsowould mark a noteworthy retreat by KKR, which, through itsbuy-outs, was by far the largest issuer of junk bonds in the1980s.   Meanwhile, KKR has told banks and KKR's outside investorsthat it plans to invest between $1.4 billion and $1.7 billionof new equity in RJR, through partnerships that KKR controls.   The exact terms under which that equity will be investedhaven't been determined. But the new equity infusion islikely to be closely pegged to the price of RJR's warrants,which are traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Thewarrants, equivalent to one share of RJR's closely heldcommon stock, closed yesterday at $6.625 each. At the time ofthe February 1989 buy-out, RJR's common was valued at $5 ashare.   For KKR, the RJR refinancing package does bear some costs,though far less than if the bond-reset problem had worsened.An equity investor with KKR said he expects the annualpercentage return from the RJR buy-out will amount to&quot;somewhere in the mid-20s&quot; after the new equity infusion.This is far less than KKR's peak returns of 60% a year orbetter in the mid-1980s, though still well above the averageannual stock-market return of 9% to 12%.   The equity infusion also will shrink KKR's untapped equityin its buy-out fund to less than $2 billion. Currently, mostbuy-out specialists' spending power is about four times theiravailable equity, meaning that KKR couldn't make more than $8billion of acquisitions before it would need to raise a newequity fund.   The new $8 billion spending ceiling is the least of KKR'sworries, though; the market for big buy-outs is practicallydead this year, anyway.   ---   Peter Waldman in Atlanta contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
