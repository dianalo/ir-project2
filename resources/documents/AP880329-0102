SIMON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A fire was discovered today in thearsenal of the Puerto Rico National Guard and police said it mighthave been triggered by an explosive device.   ``Everything indicates there was a criminal hand,'' PoliceSuperintendent Carlos Lopez Feliciano said in a statement. ``We areinvestigating if there was an explosive or incendiary device. It'snot conclusive.''   No other details on the cause of the blaze were available.   The fire was discovered by an arsenal guard about 2 a.m. whensmoke was seen coming out of the second-floor storage room, thesuperintendent said.   ``When he checked, he saw two people in the interior parkingarea who jumped the fence protecting the perimeter of thearsenal,'' Lopez Feliciano said.   All National Guard facilities were under police surveillancetoday in case the fire was part of a coordinated attack, LopezFeliciano said.   ``We are guarding all the National Guard installations in caseits part of a series,'' the superintendent said.   Local explosives experts and officials from the FBI were at thescene gathering evidence.   Early this moring several fire engines were at the sceneextinguishing the fire. There was no estimate of damages to thefacility.   About 600 members of the Puerto Rico National guard flew to thePanama Canal Zone this weekend for a training exercise. The movehas been criticized by groups favoring Puerto Rico's independencefrom the United States, as well as by individual members of thepro-statehood New Progressive Party and the governing PopularDemocratic Party.   On Monday, National Guard Adjutant Gen. Alfredo Mora denied theguardsmen were being sent to Panama for anything other thantraining purposes and said the possibility that the guards will seeany combat ``is very remote.''   Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens with most of the rights ofAmericans, except that they cannot vote for the president of theUnited States.</TEXT></DOC>
