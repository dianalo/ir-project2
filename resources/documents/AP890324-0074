(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A couple who take in former psychiatricpatients as boarders successfully challenged a town zoning rulelimiting the number of unrelated people living in the same house.   The New York state Court of Appeals, the state's top court, onThursday threw out a Long Island town's zoning law that restrictedthe number of unrelated people living together, because the town didnot also restrict the number of related people who could livetogether.   ``I'm glad it's all over. It's been a long, drawn-out thing,''said Rose Ann Baer of Brookhaven, who challenged the zoning rulingalong with her husband, Steve.   The Baers, who have a Suffolk County license to run a roominghouse, were told in 1984 that they were in violation of town rulesnonetheless, because four women lived in the home along with thecouple's two children.   The town's zoning law said no more than four unrelated peoplecould live under the same roof in a single-family district.   Two women currently live in the home with the Baers, Ms. Baersaid.   Her lawyer, Jane Reinhardt, said she was pleased with thefour-paragraph decision but disappointed with its brevity.   ``I wish they had said some kind of socially conscious thingabout the need to help the elderly and disabled,'' Reinhardt said.   Edwin Crawford, counsel for the state Association of Towns, saidthe decision should make communities look more carefully at theirzoning laws. He predicted the decision wouldn't lead to a largenumber of group or student homes opening in residential areas.   ``This does not totally abrogate the ability of local governmentsto use their zoning regulations to preserve the character ofsingle-family neighborhoods,'' Crawford said. ``It will just takesome careful draftsmanship.''   Brookhaven's town attorney, David Fishbein, did not return atelephone call seeking comment.</TEXT></DOC>
