In Frankfurt, stocks fell on profit-taking.    In Tokyo, heavy buying of financial, utility and real estate shares spurred a broad-based rally, with the Nikkei stock average surging 318.75 points to 25119.70.    Volume narrowed to 600 million shares from 650 million shares Friday. Gainers outnumbered losers, 615 to 264.    The advance was a surprise to many traders. But some said the absence of a major incident in the Persian Gulf as the U.S. continues to escort Kuwaiti tankers, lower oil prices and lingering activity by some Tokyo-based fund managers propelled most share prices higher.    Notable among the big gainers was NEC, which surged 200 yen to 2,040 yen ($13.44). The Reagan administration denied a Tokyo newspaper report, which attributed its story to &quot;Capitol Hill sources,&quot; that NEC was under investigation for suspected export-control violations.    Among other electrical and computer shares, Hitachi rose 20 yen to 1,200 yen, Sony was up 50 yen to 4,960 yen and TDK gained 30 yen to 5,080 yen.    Financial shares rebounded on continued bargain hunting. Nikko Securities rose 110 yen to 2,400 yen, Nomura Securities was up 100 yen to 4,620 yen and Yamaichi Securities surged 60 yen to 2,360 yen.    Power utilities were also higher, including Tokyo Electric Power, up 230 yen to 6,300 yen, and Tokyo Gas, up 40 yen to 1,070 yen.    Banking and real estate shares also posted strong gains.    Market participants said the strength in domestic-demand shares was a repetition of established themes during a day with few new factors on which to trade.    In London, stocks rallied from sharply lower levels to close higher in thin trading as the market got a lift from better-than-expected figures for United Kingdom producer prices in July.    The 100-share index closed up 16 points at 2242.2. The index traded as much as 22.7 points lower at the opening before rallying on the producer price news.    The Financial Times 30-share index gained 15.7 points to 1742.6. But volume fell to 528.9 million shares from 923 million shares Friday.    Dealers said concerns the economy may be overheating were calmed somewhat by news that U.K. producer prices rose 0.1% in July from June. Market expectations had been for an increase of 0.2% to 0.4%.    But trading was tentative for most of the afternoon amid continued concern about last week's rise in banks' base lending rates and nervousness ahead of Tuesday's release of U.K. trade data for June, dealers said.    With volume at lackluster levels, dealers said participants shied away from taking substantial positions before a clearer picture emerged of U.K. inflation prospects.    Investors will also be closely watching Thursday's release of June industrial production figures.    Frankfurt share prices fell as investors took profits from last week's rally, brokers said.    The decline broke a string of four sessions in which share prices climbed as West German equities latched on to the uptrend in global stocks.    But an analyst said that profit-taking had been expected and that the dollar's continued strength against the mark gives the market room to rise further.    A higher dollar would enhance profits of the country's main exporting companies.    Hoechst fell 7.6 marks to 335.5 marks ($177.42). Several international stock analysts put sell recommendations on the stock recently. One analyst said Hoechst's acquisition of Celanese had shifted emphasis too strongly toward cyclical bulk chemicals and lowered the quality of Hoechst's earnings.    In the auto sector, Bayerische Motoren Werke was down 11 marks to 737 marks. The stock has been at the forefront of the market's rally and is more prone to profit-taking, an analyst said. Volkswagen was down 1.5 marks to 402.5 marks, but Daimler-Benz rose two marks to 1,207 marks.
