CORNELL</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   While the crowd in the lecture hall awaited the appearance ofrenowned theologian Karl Barth, someone scrawled on the blackboardbehind the podium: ``God is other people.''   The rumpled, bespectacled Barth ambled onto the stage and paused,staring at the words. With a twinkle in his eyes, he picked up thechalk and added a comma, making the sentence read:   ``God is other, people.''   That total ``otherness'' of God, beyond any human calculation oringenious devising, launched the thunderbolt flung by the greatSwiss scholar into the arena of 20th century theology.   ``Only God speaks well of God,'' Barth declared, contending thatany human attempts to conceive or define him is to reduce divinityto human dimensions, choices and control, a false idol.   ``Let God be God,'' he said.   Barth (pronounced Bart) is regarded by many as the century'spreeminent Christian thinker, boldly original, penetrating,thorough, trenchantly gripping, a master in his field.   He is one in an extraordinary line of theological titans whocrossed the world's stage this century and changed the landscape ofreligious thought.   Among them were Barth's Swiss compatriot, Emil Bruner; the Germanmartyr to Nazism, Dietrich Bonhoeffer; the Roman Catholic``incarnationalist'' Karl Rahner; the ``demythologizing'' RudolfBultmann; Judaism's ``relationist'' Martin Buber; the existentialistPaul Tillich, and Christian ``realist'' Reinhold Niebuhr.   These modern religious giants all are dead, and, as the centurydraws to a close, it's almost as though some special dispensationhas ended. But their work, both emulated and criticized, permeatesthe religious world.   To Barth, the remoteness of a ``wholly other'' God constitutedhis stern ``No'' to a sin-darkened world.   Trying to know anything about God through reasoning, nature,sentiments or philosophical arguments is vain and benighted, Barthsaid, reflecting humanity's original revolt by trying itself to ``beas God.''   ``It is the attempted replacement of divine work by humanmanufacture,'' Barth said, an effort to ``divinize man and tohumanize God with romantic formulations'' so as to ``wipe out thedistance between them. ...   ``God is not to be sought out in his inscrutable loftiness.''   However, Barth said, God took the initiative to turn thatovershadowing ``No'' into a ringing ``Yes'' through the work ofChrist and the ``Word of God.''   ``And so,'' he said, ``his inevitable `No' is always enclosed inhis primary `Yes' to man.''   Barth called Christ both ``God's man'' and ``man's God,'' andsaid:   ``In the midst of his people, God lets one become man, espousingtotally the cause of this man,'' attesting identity with him, thusenacting ``community with man'' and exalting man to ``community withhim.''   Barth, who died in 1968 at age 82, belonged to the Swiss ReformedChurch, but his powerful, free-thinking scholarship carried weightnot only throughout Protestantism but also in Catholicism, withwhose thinkers he maintained a running dialogue.   In the scholarly world, Barth's approach became known as``neo-orthodox'' or ``Barthian,'' a term he deplored. He called hiswork ``evangelical theology.'' It is firmly, steadily rooted inScripture.   ``The biblical witnesses are better informed than are thetheologians,'' he said. ``For this reason theology must agree to letthem look over its shoulder and correct its notebooks.''   For all his immense erudition and analytical skills, thepipe-smoking Barth had a kindly, cheerful disposition and whimsical,self-effacing wit, seeming to take himself much less seriously thandid some of his colleagues.   ``The theologian who has no joy in his work is not a theologianat all,'' he said. ``Sulky faces, morose thoughts and boring waysare intolerable in this science.''   He had a zest for history, literature, music and detectivestories. Once, fretting about whether he would be understood in some1962 lectures in the United States, he remarked, ``My English iscriminal because I learned it by reading detective stories.''   Tender and gruff, modest but assured, he rode horseback, sangloudly _ ``like a lion,'' as a son put it _ preached regularly topenitentiary prisoners and began his days listening to Mozart.   ``It may be that when the angels go about their task of praisingGod, they play only Bach,'' he said. ``I am sure, however, that whenthey are together en famille, they play Mozart and then, too, ourdear Lord listens with a special pleasure.''   Besides Barth's driving theological work through a score ofbooks, including his 12-volume ``Church Dogmatics,'' and in lecturesaround the world, he led efforts for Christian unity and to forgechurch resistance to the Nazis.   The church ``would do better to become a tiny remnant and flee tothe catacombs than to make peace with this terrible doctrine in anyway,'' he said of Nazism.   Barth, then teaching in Bonn, Germany, helped to form theConfessing Church, a minority wing opposing Hitler's policies, andto organize the 1934 meeting that issued the famed BarmenDeclaration, blasting attempts to subordinate the church toHitlerism.   Shortly thereafter, Barth was expelled for refusing to take anoath of allegiance to Hitler or begin classes with the customary``Heil Hitler.''   He hurled his blunt ``No'' to human presumptions aboutunderstanding God at a time when Christian liberals believedscientific progress and education would gradually help achieveparadise on Earth _ a notion shattered by the horrors of war andtotalitarianism.   ``The final root and basis of all human disorder is the dreadful,godless, ridiculous idea that humanity is the Atlas to hold up thevault of heaven,'' Barth told the 1948 founding assembly of theWorld Council of Churches.   Nevertheless, he said, God ``is no lonely God, self-sufficientand self-contained.''   Rather, he freely chooses through Christ to be the ``God ofman,'' Barth said. ``He exists neither next to man nor merely abovehim, but rather with him, by him, and most of all for him.   ``A God who confronted man simply as exalted, distant andstrange, that is, a divinity without humanity, could be only the godof ... `bad news' instead of the `good news.' ... He would be thegod of a scornful, judging, deadly `No.'''   However, Barth said, ``the content of God's word is his free,undeserved `Yes' to the whole human race, in spite of all humanunreasonableness and corruption.''   Jesus ``exposes the gulf which separates God and man and byexposing it, bridges it,'' Barth said, leaving humanity ``swamped bygrace.''   Barth rejected biblical literalism, contending the Bible was notverbally infallible since everything human, including language, islimited and faulty.   Yet he saw Scripture as the medium elected by God as the mostsuitable within man's restricted sights for extending ``God's word''to humanity.   In a conversation with Barth, fellow Swiss theologian Emil Bruneronce raised the point that some of the Bible seemed profane.   ``Nonsense, it's all profane!'' Barth retorted. ``The Bible waswritten by very profane men. But, and this is the distinction, theywere profane men in conversation with God.''</TEXT><HEAD>NEXT: Tillich _ On the Boundaries</HEAD><NOTE>End Adv for Mon PMs, Dec. 19, and Thereafter</NOTE></DOC>
