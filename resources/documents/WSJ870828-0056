The agreement, approved by the boards of both companies, provides for New York-based Dun to swap .5084 common share for each of Information Resources' 16.8 million common shares.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Dun andamp; Bradstreet closed at $67 a share, down $1.25. Chicago-based Information Resources closed in national over-the-counter trading at $25 a share, up $3.    The companies made the announcement after the market closed. Based on Dun andamp; Bradstreet's closing price yesterday, Information Resource holders would receive for each of their shares stock valued at about $34. The companies intend to account for the acquisition as a pooling of interest and expect the stock swap to be tax free for holders.    Dun andamp; Bradstreet is a financial information company that owns Nielsen Media Research, the television-audience measurement concern, as well as Nielsen Marketing Research, which tracks information on brand sales and market share.    Information Resources, a fast-growing provider of test marketing services and various database services, will be merged with the Nielsen units to form Nielsen Information Resources, Dun andamp; Bradstreet said.    Information Resources' biggest single product measures the effect of television advertising on sales of packaged goods. Known as &quot;BehaviorScan,&quot; the system relies on supermarket scanners to measure electronically what people are buying in a specific area. It was introduced in 1980.    Information Resources' profit and sales have grown rapidly in recent years. Last year, the company earned $10 million, or 60 cents a share, on sales of $93.6 million.    In the first half of 1987, Dun andamp; Bradstreet earnings grew 16% to $201.3 million, or $1.32 a share, from $174.1 million, or $1.14 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 7.9% to $1.64 billion from $1.52 billion.    Charles W. Moritz, chairman and chief executive officer of Dun andamp; Bradstreet, said the acquisition will support the company's continuing &quot;development of new market research information and services&quot; world-wide. John C. Holt, chairman of the Neilsen units and a Dun andamp; Bradstreet executive vice president, added that &quot;Information Resources is consistent with the strategy we have been pursuing to develop state-of-the-art capabilities in every segment of marketing research.&quot;    Mr. Holt will be chairman and chief executive of the new Nielsen Information Resources unit. Gian Fulgoni, chief executive of Information Resources, will become president of the U.S. marketing research division of the unit; Richard Vipond, president of Nielsen Marketing, will be chairman of the international division of the research unit; and Albert Kretch, executive director of Nielsen Marketing, will be president of the same international division.    The acquisition is subject to approval by holders of a majority of Information Resources stock at a special holders' meeting this fall. In addition, the transaction is subject to a waiting period under antitrust law. Dun andamp; Bradstreet said it expects to complete the transaction before year's end.    Certain officers and directors of Information Resources have given Dun andamp; Bradstreet irrevocable proxies to vote about 24% of Information Resources' stock outstanding.    Options held by Information Resources employees to acquire about 2.3 million of the company's common shares will be converted into options to acquire Dun andamp; Bradstreet common at the same exchange ratio as the shares. </TEXT></DOC>
