Theitems include technologies that are considered to be within 2 to 3 yearsof being transferred. While the catalog does not profess to be entirelycomplete, it does represent an initial attempt at archiving innovativegeothermal technologies with ample room for additions as they occur.The catalog itself is divided into five major functional areas: Exploration;Drilling, Well Completion, and Reservoir Production; Materials and BrineChemistry; Direct Use; and Economics. Within these major divisions aresub-categories identifying specific types of technological advances:Hardware; Software; Data Base; Process/Procedure; Test Facility; andHandbook.</TEXT></DOC>
