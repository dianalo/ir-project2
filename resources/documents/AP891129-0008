President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and his top advisers believe thewhole world, including post-war Europe, has been changed forever byan explosion of technology mastered by the other side.   Looking grimly at the backwardness of his own country and hisneighbors, the breathtaking changes that have gripped EasternEurope this fall nevertheless offer Gorbachev two opportunities:   _ To renew and salvage at least part of a socialist system inwhich he sincerely believes, before stagnation and dissatisfactionblow the lid off.   _ To achieve economic reform by redirecting his own economy awayfrom the military and drawing the East into the West'stechnological revolution. Military security might be assuredthrough economic interdependence that makes confrontationunprofitable.   When he echoes the call of Alexander Dubcek 21 years ago forsocialism with a ``human face,'' _ Czechoslovakia's reform groundunder the treads of Warsaw Pact tanks _ Gorbachev seems to aim atkeeping half a loaf, rather than risking it all later inunpredictable fury.   The move has won Gorbachev respect in the West and support inEastern Europe. Poland's non-Communist government has pledgedsupport to the Warsaw Pact and continued friendship with the SovietUnion.   While acknowledging the West's technological superiority andeconomic might, Gorbachev is far from declaring surrender in theCold War. He and his advisers say they have a clearer idea of howto use Western muscle to build a new world.   ``Politically the world has entered a new phase _ it is movingout of the Cold War into a period of peace,'' Foreign MinisterEduard A. Shevardnadze told the U.S. Foreign Policy Association inOctober.   ``Today we need a consensus, an international approach to globalproblems _ not because it is a moral imperative, but for objectivereasons, because the world is a single and interdependent whole,''he said.   In a world of buyers and sellers criss-crossed with satellitecommunications and computer technology, Gorbachev sees his landthat has been sealed off and content with the abacus as theultimate loser.   ``Now we have to make up for lost time, and this requires a morerapid pace of change,'' he said last week who asked about reformsin Eastern Europe.   It also requires peace. Gorbachev is cutting 500,000 men out ofthe armed forces, about half of them from Eastern Europe. Somemissiles are being taken out of Eastern Europe. The defense budgetwas cut 8.3 percent this year and defense factories are beingretooled to make consumer goods.   Negotiations continue on sharp cuts in strategic nuclearweapons, conventional forces in Europe, and chemical weapons.   ``To put it in a nutshell, we need a normal external environmentfor our domestic work,'' Gorbachev told former West GermanChancellor Willy Brandt in October.   The Soviet Union and the czarist empire before it was fearful ofa powerful Germany in the heart of Europe. But the betting nowappears to be that if Germany is absorbed in being Eastern Europe'srich uncle, it will have little incentive to rock the boat. Thearea also may become an area of ``cooperation and understanding''between the superpowers, the government news agency Novosti said.   Marshal Sergei F. Akhromeyev, the former military chief of staffand a Gorbachev adviser, indicated in an article in the CommunistParty daily Pravda that the army may consider a land buffer is lessimportant now.   What worries the Soviet military is being surrounded by U.S.Navy firepower, Akhromeyev said. The United States has 2{ timesmore large surface ships, 15 attack aircraft carriers to none forthe Soviets, 2{ times more maritime aircraft and 19 times moreMarines, he said.   ``The U.S.A., most likely, intends to continue using theseforces to put pressure on us and threaten the Soviet Union,'' hesaid.   If Gorbachev and his advisers believe they have a clear idea ofthe future, they are concerned that short-term instability inEastern Europe could ruin it.   ``Any deep changes, especially those in key regions of theworld, are accompanied by instability and difficulties. This isonly natural. The most dangerous thing at such moments is thatsomeone may be tempted to use them for their own selfishinterests,'' he said on Nov. 21.   The Berlin Wall, however many holes it has, must remain standingfor the time being, the Soviets say. Too much is changing in Europefor the region to cope simultaneously with the elimination of thepolitical structure that kept the peace, however tense, for morethan 40 years.   Gorbachev's fear of Eastern Europe spinning entirely out ofcontrol may be why he has so firmly supported reform in Poland,Hungary, East Germany, Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia. Gorbachev wasin China earlier this year just before authorities cracked down onpro-democracy demonstrators and killed hundreds of them.   An Eastern Europe with no hope of catching up or enjoying thefruits of the West's technological revolution could be more likelyto explode. Some reports in East Germany say orders to shoot atprotesters had been given before Erich Honecker was forced out byEgon Krenz.   The alternative to reform _ tighter borders and more stagnation_ would mean abject defeat in the Cold War.</TEXT><TEXT>   EDITOR'S NOTE: Mark J.
