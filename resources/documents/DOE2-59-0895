The thin film of Bi{sub 2}O{sub3}, Sr-Ca alloy, and Cu metal was coevaporated on (MgO) single crystalsubstrate by controlling each evaporating rate and then heat treatedat 850-890{sup 0}C for several hours in O{sub 2} atmosphere. The structurewas evaluated by EPMA and X ray diffraction patterns, Tc was measuredby dc four terminal process and the anisotropy of critical field wasevaluated by applying parallel and perpendicular fields to the thin film.It was found that the composition of high Tc phase was strongly dependenton the thin film composition and heat treatment, Tc=107K was obtainedat Ca/(Sr+Ca)=0.51 and larger anisotropy for Hc{sub 2}(upper criticalfield) was confirmed on both high and low Tc phases.
