Chipello   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>02/11/92</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A10</SO><RE>FAR EAST (FE)JAPAN (JA)PACIFIC RIM (PRM)</RE><LP>   TOKYO -- Emboldened by their victory in an Upper Houseby-election, Japanese opposition parties hardened theirdemands for a parliamentary inquiry into political scandalsinvolving associates of Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa.   The opposition parties have refused since Feb. 5 toparticipate in budget hearings until the ruling LiberalDemocratic Party agrees to summon witnesses to testify aboutthe scandals. That stalemate persisted yesterday. But therewere hints that the LDP, chastened by its loss in Sunday'sby-election in Nara prefecture, is preparing to meet at leastsome of the opposition's demands.</LP><TEXT>   Japanese news reports said the LDP is floating proposalsto produce some of the witnesses sought by the oppositionparties, albeit on less-stringent terms than the oppositionhas sought. The opposition wants the witnesses summoned underprocedures that would expose them to prosecution for perjury.That bargaining stance was strengthened by Sunday's election,in which the LDP candidate was thrashed by a rival backed bythe Rengo labor federation and the Socialist and DemocraticSocialist parties.   The by-election was only the latest blow to Mr. Miyazawasince he took office barely three months ago. The primeminister has suffered through bungled legislativeinitiatives, the arrest of a senior political ally on briberycharges and a highly charged period of trade tension with theU.S. Opposition parties also are pressing for details on theinvolvement of Mr. Miyazawa's office in the 1980s Recruit Co.influence-peddling scandal.   One senior LDP official involved in the parliamentarynegotiations was quoted in Japanese newspapers yesterdayevening as indicating that he hopes to get budget talksmoving by early next week. Although the LDP's majority in theLower House enables it to pass budget bills on its own,ramming legislation through without opposition participationwould further damage the LDP's image, something the partywants to avoid as it faces two more by-elections in March anda general Upper House election in July.   Meanwhile, another potential political scandal continuesto bubble: Japanese newspapers have reported on financiallinks between Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin, a package-deliverycompany, and firms tied to an underworld group. Tokyo Sagawais rumored to have been a major contributor to scores ofpoliticians, and officials in opposition parties as well asthe LDP are said to be wary of an impending investigation bylaw-enforcement authorities into the company's politicalconnections.</TEXT></DOC>
