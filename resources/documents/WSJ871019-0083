The 23,000 letter sorters, postal clerks, and other indoor postal workers had walked out to support union demands in contract negotiations between the Canadian Union of Postal Workers and Canada Post Corp., the government-owned postal agency.    Union president Jean-Claude Parrot ordered his members to return to work after the law was passed Friday by the Canadian parliament. He said the law was intended to &quot;destroy the union&quot; by inciting union leaders to defy it and that he refused to fall into that trap.    The law set stiff fines for workers and union officials who disobey, ranging from a minimum 500 Canadian dollars ($385) a day for a worker to a minimum 10,000 dollars a day for a union officer. It also prohibits a defiant union officer from representing the union for five years. It provides for a &quot;mediator-arbitrator&quot; to be appointed by government to settle the dispute. If the appointee, who hasn't been announced, is unable to reach a consensus between the two sides, he would arbitrate a contract, taking into consideration a conciliator's report released last month.    The conciliator's report supports the major demand of Canada Post -- the ability to franchise some postal operations to the private sector, which was the main stumbling block to a negotiated settlement. The union contends that such a move would result in a loss of 4,200 of the best union-covered jobs.    Mr. Parrot said the union would use &quot;innovative means&quot; to fight the privatization of services by Canada Post.    A Canada Post spokeswoman said employees were on the job at all postal facilities across Canada and that delivery should be back to normal almost immediately. The postal agency used contract workers to staff sorting facilities during the walkouts that began Sept. 30, and it maintains delivery was near normal during the strike.    In an effort to avoid back-to-work legislation, the union began with scattered walkouts but after the government bill was introduced Oct. 8, the union broadened the action to a nationwide strike. The opposition New Democratic and Liberal parties delayed the passage of the bill, which they called Draconian, and succeeded in making some minor amendments to the legislation.    Meanwhile, police are investigating a weekend fire in Toronto that caused an estimated 35,000 dollars of damage to a trailer filled with mail. The fire, which police say was set by arsonists, damaged more than 100,000 pieces of mail. The Canada Post spokeswoman said most of the mail can be salvaged and will be delivered. </TEXT></DOC>
