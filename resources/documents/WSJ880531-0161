Mr. Leonard makes it clear that these crooks were always hypocrites: &quot;That whole show back then was a put-on. You gonna tell me we were trying to change the world? We were kicking a -- and having fun. All that screaming about Vietnam and burning draft cards? That was a little bitty part of it. Getting stoned and {having sex} was the trip.&quot; Now that yippies have become yuppies, they've returned to exploit their former classmates and avenge a presumed betrayal by extorting millions with bomb threats. &quot;Dynamite and acid, man, that'll Star Trek you back to good times. The way it was.&quot; Their cynical patter is matched by their psychotic violence.    But Mr. Leonard (who was contemptuous of a Contra con game in his recent novel &quot;Bandits&quot;) is careful to differentiate these freaks from the true '60s &quot;politicals,&quot; and he is anything but sympathetic toward their rich victims. Mark Ricks is a glitzy regional theater producer who wants to stage rock revival concerts that will bring back his youth. His brother Woody, who's worth $100 million, is a grotesque 250-pound alcoholic moron who spends his time watching Arnold Schwarzenegger movies, eating peanuts, and floating stark naked on a rubber raft in his indoor swimming pool listening to favorites from &quot;My Fair Lady.&quot; (He also has raped and assaulted a showgirl.)    As his supercool chauffeur, cook, houseboy and bodyguard, Donnell Lewis, says, &quot;If the man was any dumber you'd have to water him twice a week.&quot; Donnell is an ex-Black Panther with an eye for the kickback and a place in the will, and though his role as jive-talking jack-of-all-trades to the obese millionaire is not a little improbable, his speech tends to make us forgive it: He tells a cop who's had a nasty run-in with a thug, &quot;What I meant for him was to talk to you was all. You understand? Ask you kindly would you mind stepping away from something wasn't any of your business.&quot;    The bomb squad detective who plays the hero is an &quot;assertive, self-confident, macho-type,&quot; &quot;hard-nose,&quot; &quot;old-timey&quot; cop nearing 40 with &quot;woman trouble&quot; (natch, because he's no cool, hypocritical yuppie) but no lack of companionship. Chris Mankowski is an honest &quot;hunk&quot; and eager after 12 years to get off the bomb squad into something less sordid like Sex Crimes, but the system's corrupt and he finds himself suspended for collaring Woody Ricks for assault of the showgirl.    Mankowski is that familiar knight in squalid armor, the hard-boiled dick (slightly sensitized for the '80s, less overtly racist and sexist), out to save the honor of a woman and defeat the agents of criminal disorder. It helps that he's a mean man with a nine-millimeter pistol and has a sharp eye for wiring (and defusing) dynamite. He's street smart in an &quot;old-timey&quot; way, but no Sherlock Holmes, of course. This is a thriller, not a puzzle, after all. The distinction is worth pursuing.    In the 147 years since Poe invented the modern mystery story with &quot;The Murders in the Rue Morgue,&quot; the genre has been adapted for high literature (Dickens, Dostoevski, Borges, Pynchon), low entertainment (Spillane, Fleming), and an interesting hybrid of the two (Hammett, Graham Greene, le Carre), but it generally takes one of two forms: the puzzle or the thriller (spy stories and police procedurals come in both varieties). In a puzzle, an often eccentric mastermind exerts surprising powers of deduction that confirm the basic rationality of the world. In a thriller an innocent or a tough guy uses his low instincts and savvy to restore the delicate moral (if not legal or social) order of things.    &quot;He felt like somebody had taken the lid off life and let him look at the works,&quot; writes Hammett. How tricky &quot;the works&quot; turn out to be -- not merely how intricate but how intrinsically ambiguous -- makes all the difference between literature and entertainment. By their very nature, puzzles and thrillers tend to be reductive, &quot;comforting fables.&quot; Such writers as Chandler, Ross Macdonald and le Carre flirt with questions of radical disorder but settle for answers from sociology and psychoanalysis.    Elmore Leonard is closest to Chandler but avoids the thick atmosphere and lush sentimental style. He's very much a writer for the '80s: not too rich and heavy, easy on the eyes. His recent books -- the best are &quot;Stick&quot; and &quot;Glitz&quot; -- are set in Miami (city of the decade), San Juan, Atlantic City and Detroit, but these scenes are never very extensively depicted, though he's good on bar life and casinos. His heroes usually are ex-convicts (armed robbery, jewel theft) or fatigued detectives. The psychology is never particularly weird or taxing; the motives tend to be greed or revenge. The crimes are straightforward, too: extortion, drug dealing, theft, rape and murder along the way -- no big capers or complex schemes of paranoid intensity. These books are designed to make time fly and, like &quot;Freaky Deaky,&quot; after some nasty fun they deliver the spectacle of virtue triumphant in melodramatic battle with vice. This is tomcat fiction.    ---   Mr. Locke teaches English and comparative literature at Columbia University. </TEXT></DOC>
