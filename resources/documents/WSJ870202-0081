The Air Force decided to award Pratt andamp; Whitney 55% of the engine work in fiscal 1988, when it will buy a total of 328 jet engines for it two primary fighters, the General Dynamics Corp. F-16 and the McDonnell Douglas Corp. F-15.    The Air Force will negotiate the engine contracts in coming weeks, but officials estimate the total value of the work to be $1 billion.
