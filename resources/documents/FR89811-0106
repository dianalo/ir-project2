This notice was published in the<T4>Federal Register </T4>on July 19, 1989 (54 FR 30289). The petitioner supported by the company submitted new data on sales ofnatural gas and crude oil and provided a list of major customers. The Corpus Christi operation produced primarily natural gas. The Department'sinitial investigation showed that the decreased sales and/or productioncriterion of the Group Eligibility Requirements of the Trade Act of 1974was not met. In order for a worker group to become certified eligible to apply for tradeadjustment assistance it must meet all three of the Group Eligibility Requirementsof the Trade Act_a significant decrease in employment, an absolute decreasein sales or production and an increase in imports ``contributed importantly''to worker separations. The ``contributed importantly'' test is generallydemonstrated by a survey of the customers of the workers' firm. Although the Corpus Christi operation meets the first two criteria of theGroup Eligibility Requirements, it was found on reconsideration, that itdid not meet the ``contributed importantly'' test. The Department surveyed the major customers of the Corpus Christi operationwhich accounted for nearly all of Corpus Christi's natural gas sales in1988 and found that none of the customers imported natural gas. Also, customerspurchasing crude oil from Corpus Christi reported decreased purchases ofimported crude oil in the first half of 1988 compared to the same periodin 1987. Investigative findings reveal that worker separations at Corpus Christiwere the result of a management reorganization in early 1989 when the CorpusChristi office was combined with the Lafayette, Louisiana office. <ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion </ITAG>After reconsideration, I affirm the original notice of negative determinationof eligibility to apply for adjustment assistance to workers and formerworkers of Forest Oil Corporation, Corpus Christi, Texas. <ITAG tagnum="21">Signed at Washington, DC, this 4th day of August 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Barbara Ann Farmer,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Director, Office of Program Management, UIS. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-18845 Filed 8-10-89; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-30-M</ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
