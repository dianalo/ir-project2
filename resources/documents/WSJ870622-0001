But some foreign exchange trading strategists still believe the dollar's decline is far from over. The recent stability, they say, is just temporary.    Without a doubt, the dollar has looked better lately. Against the West German mark, the dollar tumbled 47% from its March 1985 peak to its level in mid-January of this year. Since then, the dollar hasn't moved more than 2.5% above or below 1.80 marks.    Moreover, dollar stability has become the avowed goal of leaders of the non-communist world's economic powers. So far this year, their central banks have spent nearly $40 billion in currency market intervention to back up that vow.    But for many market participants, the outlook for further declines is unchanged. Here are three such views:    A further drop in the dollar seems dictated by U.S. trade and budget deficits, according to Garrett R. Glass, vice president of foreign exchange at First National Bank of Chicago.    &quot;We know that the U.S. needs $30 billion a quarter alone to cover its current account deficit,&quot; Mr. Glass says. &quot;You need another $15 billion a quarter in foreign financing to cover the budget deficit. As people overseas decline to do that, they need a lower dollar to convince them.    &quot;It's true our trade deficit is troughing out and it's no longer getting worse. But even though trade (figures) are improving, the interest part of our international debt is worsening. And there's a fundamental fact, we're still running huge deficits, and we still need foreign investment,&quot; he says.    &quot;If you start seeing the (monthly) trade deficit consistently below $10 billion, then you can expect to see some improvement in the dollar.&quot;    The recent halt in the dollar's decline is in part a technical market reaction, Mr. Glass says. &quot;This is a natural phenomenon when you get a period of one-way trading for two years. If we had truly bottomed, you'd expect (the dollar) to erupt&quot; skyward, Mr. Glass says. For now, &quot;there's a technical and fundamental view that the dollar is going absolutely no place,&quot; he says. This period could last from a few weeks to several months, he adds.    At Bankers Trust Co., Jay Pomrenze, managing director for foreign exchange, argues that &quot;the downtrend for the dollar is still intact. What we're experiencing now is either a correction or consolidation that accompanies deep trends in the marketplace.&quot;    The correction &quot;came at the tail end of a pretty emotional sell-off of the dollar around last Christmas.&quot; That sort of rebound is &quot;classical behavior of the market&quot; following a sharp move, he says.    &quot;Within three months, the correction should end if it's in proportion with the depths of the market,&quot; Mr. Pomrenze says. The economic fundamentals aren't changing day to day, he says. &quot;The fundamentals warrant a lower dollar,&quot; he adds.    Albert Soria, vice president and foreign exchange manager at Swiss Bank Corp., New York, believes that 1.8750 marks is &quot;the absolute top&quot; for the dollar in this correction. &quot;The longer term view is very bearish&quot; for the dollar, he says.    The dollar's outlook against the Japanese yen has turned complicated, Mr. Soria says, because of political tensions in South Korea. Currently, the yen is liable to fall against the dollar, he believes, &quot;because the Japanese have very heavy investment in (South) Korea. If the South Korean situation becomes more inflamed, the dollar could go to 150 yen very, very quickly and probably test 155,&quot; he says. The dollar stood at 144.83 yen late Friday in New York.    &quot;The yen may have lost some of its allure, for the short term,&quot; he says.    Mr. Soria, like many traders, declines to predict when or at what level the dollar will finally finish its long decline. He says, &quot;I can't really pick a bottom because I have to remain flexible. If I become obstinate I can risk a heck of a lot of money. As a trader, I'm rolling with the punches.&quot;    ---   Friday's Currency Activity   The dollar edged higher in moderate, technical trading, but market attention was focused on sterling, which succumbed to heavy selling pressure.    In late New York trading, the British pound stood at $1.6105, down 1.1% from $1.6281 Thursday. The dollar firmed to 1.8296 marks from 1.8255 Thursday, and to 144.83 yen, from 144.73.    Dealers attributed the sell-off in sterling to fear that British inflation is beginning to show signs of creeping upward and to disappointment that the inflow of foreign investment expected after the Conservative Party victory in the recent general election hasn't materialized.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell $5.90 an ounce to $445 in brisk trading. The estimated volume was 4.5 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $446.10 an ounce in early trading Monday in Hong Kong.    ---                     LATE NEW YORK TRADING                     Friday, June 19, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
