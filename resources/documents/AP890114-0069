Col. William R. Higgins, whoturns 44 on Sunday, remains a mystery.   The last word on the American, kidnapped in south Lebanon 11months ago, came Dec.12 when his pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem captorssaid they had sentenced him to death for spying for Israel.   No body has been found.   The Organization for the Oppressed on Earth, which claimedresponsibility for Higgins' abduction, has also claimedresponsibility for kidnapping 12 Lebanese Jews since 1984 and hassaid it killed eight of them. Four bodies have been found.   However, a Shiite source, familiar with the thinking ofpro-Iranian factions, said he did not believe Higgins has been slain.   ``He's too valuable a card to be wasted,'' said the source,speaking on condition of anonymity.   ``He's an American officer who had held sensitive posts in theUnited States. He also served with the United Nations. This makeshim an American national security interest and an internationalinterest,'' the source said.   Higgins is one of 15 foreigners, including nine Americans, heldhostage in Lebanon. The hostage held longest is American journalistTerry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The AssociatedPress, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985.   Higgins, of Danville, Ky., led a 76-man U.N. military observergroup monitoring the Lebanon-Israel border when he was kidnappedFeb. 17, 1988.   Two days later, the Organization of the Oppressed on Earth issueda statement claiming the abduction and charging that Higgins spiedfor the ``satanic CIA.''   The United States and the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon, to whichHiggins' observer group was attached, denied he was a spy.   The kidnappers originally said they would release Higgins ifIsrael withdrew from territory it occupies in south Lebanon; if allLebanese and Palestinians held by Israel and its militia allies werefreed; and if the United States halted alleged involvement inefforts to crush a Palestinian uprising in Israeli-occupiedterritories.   Five days after the kidnapping, the group released a 70-secondvideotape of Higgins in which he repeated his captors' demands.   On Feb.25, about 10,000 people demonstrated in Moslem west Beirutchanting ``death to Higgins.''   The pro-Iranian group Hezbollah, believed to be the parentorganization for Shiite factions holding most of hostages, declaredits support for Higgins' kidnapping April 11.   Hezbollah's chief spokesman, Sheik Ibrahim el-Amin, told a Beirutnews conference that Higgins was ``not kidnapped, but detained.''   ``We haven't been involved in his detention, but we support it,''he said.   In a statement April 21, the kidnappers dropped their offer tofree Higgins and said he would be stand trial ``for the crimes hehas committed.''   It accused him of taking part in ``American conspiracies''against Moslems and supervising ``a Pentagon team to combat Lebaneseand Palestinian Islamic organizations.''   The Organization of the Oppressed on Earth said in a statementissued in December, ``We have issued the irrevocable sentence toexecute this American spy.''</TEXT></DOC>
