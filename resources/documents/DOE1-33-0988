To further investigate the role of theseinteractions in translational control, the authors compare in vitro therelative sensitivities of rabbit and human {alpha}- and {beta}-globinmRNAs to translational inhibition by cap analogues. They find that rabbit{beta}-globin mRNA is more resistant to translational inhibition by capanalogues than rabbit {alpha}-globin mRNA, while in contrast, human {beta}-globinmRNA is more sensitive to cap analogue inhibition than human {alpha}-and {beta}-globin mRNAs is unexpected as direct in vivo and in vitrocomparisons of polysome profiles reveal parallel translational handlingof the {alpha}- and {beta}-globin mRNAs from these two species. Thisdiscordance between the relative translational sensitivities of thesemRNAs to cap analogues and their relative ribosome loading activitiessuggests that cap-dependent events may not be rate limiting in steady-stateglobin translation.</TEXT></DOC>
