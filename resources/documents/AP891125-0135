Joseph F. Fernandez, who was the CIA's station chief in CostaRica, told the Times in an interview published in Sunday editionsthat senior CIA officials who knew about his efforts remainedsilent and let him take the blame for the agency's role.   Fernandez said officials who knew of his activities includedElliott Abrams, former assistant secretary of state for CentralAmerica; Alan Fiers, former chief of the CIA's Central America TaskForce; and Clair George, the agency's former deputy director ofcovert operations.   Informed of Fernandez' statements, Abrams told the Times: ``Iwas not his superior. In any event, I have testified fully on this.I am just not going to get into denying and not denying.''   Fiers declined to comment and George's wife said George was notavailable to comment, the Times said.   Fernandez was accused of four criminal violations, includingmaking false statements to CIA officials and to a presidentialreview board when he was asked about his efforts in Central Americato help former National Security Council aide Oliver North.   Fernandez helped North organize deliveries of weapons andsupplies to the Nicaraguan Contras at a time such aid was notallowed by Congress.   CIA officials told Congress before the Iran-Contra affair becamepublic that the agency was not helping the Contras. AfterFernandez' activities were disclosed, CIA officials told members ofCongress that they were unaware of the full extent of their agents'activities in Latin America.   Fernandez told the Times his CIA superiors had violated theunwritten code of honor of ``loyalty up, loyalty down'' thattraditionally guided agents.   Fernandez was the only CIA official indicted in the Iran-Contraaffair. The charges against him were dismissed Friday by a federaljudge who cited Attorney General Dick Thornburgh's decision not toallow Fernandez to use classified material for his defense.</TEXT></DOC>
