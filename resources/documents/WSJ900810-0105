That's why residents voice growing concern over effects ofsharply higher oil prices, rising interest rates and asoftening economy. &quot;Here we go again,&quot; says Joe Mrazek, alocal developer who has been instrumental in rejuvenatingthis city's downtown, where big blue &quot;Re-discover Downtown&quot;banners wave.</LP><TEXT>   In cities across the U.S., residents are beginning towonder just how much their economic lives will be affected bythe events in the Mideast and an already fragile economy.Here and elsewhere, residents, business owners and cityofficials haven't taken any bold steps yet to counter whatcould be difficult times ahead.   But they're worried. Mayor Owen Davies, for instance, saysa lot hinges on the continued prosperity of the city'sbiggest employer, J.I. Case International. The farm-equipmentmaker, a unit of Tenneco Co., employs 3,000 workers locallyand is building its new $100 million headquarters complexalong the bending shores of the Root River here.   Tax receipts from the company's big project are earmarkedto help restore an economically depressed area of westernRacine. Should Case be unable to complete its five-yearphased project, as planned, &quot;then our growth will bestymied,&quot; says Mr. Davies. He adds: &quot;We've been on a goodroll lately, so we don't think that's going to happen.&quot;   Still, a spokesman for Case, which is enjoying its ownresurgence, acknowledges that &quot;this company, like any other,is susceptible to the ebb and flow of the economy.&quot;   Racine residents think they're in better shape to weathera business downturn now than they were a decade ago. A new$20 million marina and festival hall downtown is bringing inmore tourist dollars. In addition, low housing costs herehave been drawing young families here from Milwaukee, just 25miles north, and Chicago, 65 miles south.   The city's strategic location and decreased dependence onindustry &quot;will keep us from going back to where we were,&quot;contends Jess Levin, president of the Bank of Elmwood. &quot;I'mnot expecting anything like the '80s.&quot;   The real estate market, though, already is slowing. Mr.Mrazek, who has built two new office buildings, says he is&quot;very concerned.&quot; And the softening market comes as two bigprojects near completion: a 72-unit lakefront condominiumproject and a separate development of 20 townhomes and 104condominium units with private boat slips.   At the showpiece Frank Lloyd Wright-designed headquartersof S.C. Johnson andamp; Son, fresh recession worries haven't hityet. But veteran employees of the privately heldconsumer-products giant recall what happened when troubleshit in the early 1980s. The company froze wages for one yearand trimmed its payroll by about 300 through anearly-retirement program.</TEXT></DOC>
