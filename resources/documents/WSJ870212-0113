About $3 billion of debt is affected. Earlier this week, Moody's Investors Service Inc. downgraded $3.52 billion of Louisiana's general obligation bonds to Baa-1 from single-A. Sandamp;P said the downgrading reflects the state's continued financial shortages that have been addressed with &quot;inadequate budgetary measures that could lead to future fiscal imbalances.&quot; The rating concern noted that the state's economic decline resulted in severe revenue reductions and its diminished ability to address operating, as well as mounting, debt service and pension costs. A spokeswoman for the governor's office said the state has responded well to its economic troubles that were caused by plunging oil prices.    ---   KANEB SERVICES INC. -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. lowered the subordinated debt ratings of two subsidiaries of Houston-based Kaneb. Moody's lowered the subordinated debt ratings of Kaneb's Moran Energy Inc. and Moran Energy International N.V. units to Caa from single-B-3. The rating concern cited Kaneb's decision to suspend payments on all its long-term debt and operating leases. The energy services company made this move despite a good liquidity position because it expects severe cash flow pressures over the near term, Moody's said. The pressures stem mainly from depressed industry conditions and Kaneb's high level of operating leases, Moody's added. A Kaneb spokesman said that &quot;there's not much to say except that it wasn't unexpected.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
