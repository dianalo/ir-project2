Biloxi has its share of decrepit streets, boarded store fronts and run-down housing. In the West End Homes public housing project, Sidney Reed grabs a broom and sweeps a pile of rodent dung from a corner between the stove and sink. In the refrigerator, dozens of small roaches lie dead.    In fact, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has come to Biloxi's rescue. But it hasn't kept the rats and the roaches out of Biloxi's housing projects. HUD has helped with money the city used to buy a restaurant and engineer a marina, among other things.    Such amenities are part of a $20-million-to-$40-million waterfront development project that has become a minor monument to hanky-panky at HUD. By using HUD money to underwrite some of the project's initial costs, local and federal officials have distorted the department's mandate to foster low-income housing beyond easy recognition -- and perhaps also beyond the limits of the law. The billions of dollars that should have reached the poor during the Reagan years at HUD, but that went instead to politically motivated purposes, represent the heavy price paid by the poor as a result of the influence-peddling and skewed priorities at HUD.    In the waterfront-project scandal that deprived the poor of this struggling city, the cast of characters includes Deborah Gore Dean, the glamorous, ambitious former HUD official at the center of the investigations under way in Washington. According to persons familiar with aspects of the Biloxi project, Ms. Dean was called about the waterfront grant by the White House when she was executive assistant to former HUD Secretary Samuel Pierce.    Ms. Dean, who testified before a federal grand jury, said the project got special attention because of the White House interest, according to the sources. Ms. Dean stated that she often received phone calls from the White House or from members of Congress concerning applicants seeking HUD funds, the sources add. For example, Sen. Trent Lott, a Mississippi Republican, was a strong supporter of the Biloxi project, and his office called Ms. Dean to let her know of his support, according to the sources.    The characters also include Biloxi's former mayor, Gerald Blessey, and Reba Capers, former executive director of the Greater Biloxi Economic Development Foundation; both are awaiting a jury verdict in federal court here, where they stood trial for illegally using federal funds for the project. Dubois Gilliam, a former HUD official in Washington, also has been indicted. Mr. Gilliam allegedly had a financial interest in the project while he was steering federal money into it. All deny wrongdoing.    Former Mayor Blessey began pushing the project in December 1983. Biloxi's economy hadn't fully rebounded, and still hasn't, from Hurricane Camille, which ravaged the Point Cadet waterfront 20 years ago. Development there was supposed to generate 1,400 jobs at a hotel, an assortment of specialty shops and eating places called a &quot;festival marketplace,&quot; an amusement park and the marina.    Connie Payton, president of Biloxi's tenants association, says she doubts that the poor would get the jobs on Biloxi's fancy new waterfront. &quot;I don't think it would benefit anyone,&quot; she says. &quot;I just think their priorities are all wrong.&quot;    The city had the power to apply for, obtain and disburse HUD funds to projects directly benefiting the needy. But in a series of 4-to-3 votes over the past five years, the city council allocated to waterfront development most of the community-development grant that the city automatically got from HUD each year.    Councilman Bill Stallworth, who represents Biloxi's poorest ward, sums up the views of development supporters. &quot;With jobs and money,&quot; he says, &quot;people can solve the problem of poor housing.&quot; Opponents argued for using federal money to help the poor more directly. They say the money could have been gone to expand health programs for the old, shelters for the homeless and recreation facilities.    &quot;There were a lot of programs that could have been started here that never were started here,&quot; says Dianne Harenski, one of three council members who consistently opposed the waterfront project. She was recently defeated for re-election.    Although the promoters of Point Cadet cited its economic-development benefits for the city, there were poor commercial areas that could just as easily have been served with the same HUD funds. At Main and Division streets, in a neighborhood where many of the poor live, a drug market flourishes at night. Along Main Street, south of Division, a row of stores has been vacant for years -- a shooting gallery for drugs until the buildings were recently boarded up. The former mayor did support a plan to rehabilitate and reopen the properties as apartments, professional offices and retail establishments, but the proposal fizzled. As HUD money flowed to the waterfront, &quot;we have not gotten one penny,&quot; says Roy Irons, who owns the inner-city property.    The Rev. James Black, who runs a community-services program a block from the intersection, says city officials used statistics to document the impoverishment of the community to obtain federal funds -- only to divert the money to projects that didn't benefit the poor. &quot;They violated the trust of minority and poor communities,&quot; he says.    Improved public housing was another demand. In a complaint to HUD Inspector General Paul Adams, a tenants' association representing Biloxi's public-housing residents said &quot;gross neglect&quot; by the Biloxi Housing Authority allowed &quot;bats, rats, roaches, termites, fire ants and snakes to endanger the health and safety of the occupants.&quot; The Housing Authority's new management say its predecessors don't appear to have requested federal money to improve the situation.    Biloxi did aggressively pursue federal money for the waterfront. In December 1986, the city got a $500,000 grant from HUD Secretary Pierce's special discretionary fund to further the development of a Point Cadet hotel. To help get the grant, the city retained two former HUD officials as consultants, Michael Karem of Washington, D.C., and Karen Ball of Columbus, Ohio.    According to an audit by the HUD inspector general this year, the city used nearly two-thirds of the money for expenses that the department hadn't authorized. The indictment against former Mayor Blessey and Ms. Capers asserts they spent $160,000 to defray some costs of a bond sale related to Point Cadet development rather than for the improvements contemplated by the city's grant application.    City officials defend the spending. They say they submitted an amendment to their application that would have allowed it, and assumed that HUD had approved it.    The indictment against Mr. Gilliam, a former HUD deputy assistant secretary for program policy development and evaluation, asserts that he used his position to help Biloxi get a $2.8 million urban development grant, the $500,000 grant and a federal loan. The indictment contends that he would have profited from a financial interest in the project's festival marketplace. His trial hasn't been scheduled.    In a separate case in May, he pleaded guilty in federal court in the Virgin Islands to taking $8,100 in illegal gratuities from an official of a St. Thomas housing development corporation; the corporation had received a $600,000 HUD grant.    Charles Adams, Mr. Gilliam's nephew, was indicted in October for allegedly lying to a grand jury investigating Point Cadet. Mr. Adams was an executive in the Arlington County, Va., office of Northwest Investment Inc., which planned to develop Point Cadet's festival marketplace. His lawyer says Mr. Adams has pleaded innocent.    HUD auditors also found irregularities in Biloxi's use of more than $4.3 million in community-development grants. They reported that city officials improperly paid $248,000 from the grants for marina engineering fees that the Biloxi Port Commission, an agency not authorized to receive such grants, should have paid. The city, however, says the engineering work was done for Point Cadet Development Corp., which was eligible for HUD money.    The audit found that city officials used $680,287 in grant money in May 1986 to buy The Factory Restaurant. The richly decorated restaurant, next to the marina, caters to boaters and tourists. &quot;The only beneficiaries were the owners, who received cash and debt relief from the transaction and retained control of the restaurant through a lease-back arrangement for at least 30 years,&quot; HUD's audit report said. It also said the restaurant operators weren't required to pay for 2 1/2 years.    The city has responded that, in general, the conclusions of the audit report are &quot;erroneous and defamatory.&quot; As for The Factory, the city says, it was necessary to buy it to obtain public parking space and waterfront access and to allow the city &quot;to control the facade and aesthetics for the entire project.&quot;    The criminal prosecution and other legal tangles have left the future of much of the Point Cadet project in doubt. &quot;It's dead in the water right now,&quot; says Robert Landry, former executive director of the Point Cadet Development Corp., who was cited as an unindicted co-conspirator in the federal case. HUD money continues to flow, however. At least until 1994, HUD grants will go to repay a HUD loan the city took to acquire property for the development.    Down at the marina, the waterfront development still seems like a good idea to Richard Oliver, a Baton Rouge contractor who is preparing to brush the algae from his sloop. &quot;Being a Republican, I like to see people work rather than just giving them housing that they probably would not take care of anyway.&quot;    Annie Powell disagrees. She lives in a Bayou Auguste public-housing unit that she complains hasn't been painted in 16 years. &quot;They should fix up everybody in the projects (first),&quot; she says. &quot;It's a shame we have to come home into this environment. It's hard.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
