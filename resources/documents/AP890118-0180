ROTHBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   As a prologue to the broader governmentalchange to occur on Friday, George Bush's team took power Wednesdayat the Republican National Committee with the election of toughinfighter Lee Atwater as party chairman.   ``He will be my political eyes and ears,'' said thepresident-elect during a brief appearance at a Republican luncheonshortly after Atwater's election.   With ties to Bush that go back to 1973 when the president-electwas party chairman, Atwater appeared certain to shift politicalinfluence from the White House staff to the party headquartersacross town.   During Ronald Reagan's presidency, political decisions were madeby such White House aides as Lyn Nofziger and Ed Rollins.   After his unanimous election to the chairmanship, Atwater toldthe RNC that Republican must begin ``reaching into communities wherethe Republican message has not yet found a home.   ``Face it: We have been fighting with one arm tied behind ourback _ because the Democrats have succeeded in virtually corneringthe votes of whole segments of American society.''   Atwater said blacks, Hispanics, Asians and disabled Americans``have not historically been part of our coalition'' and added, ``wemust invite these Americans into our party's councils.''   Bush endorsed the idea, saying, ``I like the concept that ourparty needs to have a broader base, a stronger participation.''   Atwater and Bush made their appeals to a 165-member body that,according to a RNC aide, has only two black members, both from theVirgin Islands.   Vice President-elect Dan Quayle referred to Atwater's reputationas a tough political gut-fighter and, joking, said the new chairmanwas ``tough, tenacious, a real fighter. He'll fit right in makingthis party kinder and gentler.''   Also speaking briefly was former New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu,Bush's choice for White House chief of staff.   Sununu said, ``I come to this job from outside the (Washington)Beltway. ... There are some who consider that an impediment. Iaccept their judgment in that respect. I will do my best to learnwhat I have to do as chief of staff.''   But, he went on to say that his experience outside the Beltwaygave him a better sense of ``the critical nature of the politicalstructures back home.''   Atwater's predecessor, Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr., held thechairmanship for six years, the longest tenure this century.   His parting message emphasized the need for Republicans tocontrol the process by which legislative district lines will beredrawn, on the state and federal level, to conform with populationshifts determined in the 1990 Census.   In 1981, Republicans sought to control redistricting with a heavyinvestment in computers. But Democrats controlled more governorshipsand state legislatures and they won the day.   The same situation threatens to occur in 1991 unless Republicanovercome the current Democratic edge in state politics.   Fahrenkopf pointed out that 98 percent House incumbents runningfor re-election in 1988 were victorious _ a return rate he said washigher than that for members of the Supreme Soviet.   But the part of Fahrenkopf's speech that drew the most attentionfrom committee members was his outline of the arrangements togetting members to various events connected with the Bushinauguration.   ``I remind you,'' he told them ``there is no food at inauguralballs. This is not a dinner, folks.''</TEXT></DOC>
