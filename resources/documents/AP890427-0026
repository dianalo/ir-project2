JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Millions of homeowners hire companies to treattheir lawns, but most states make no attempt to assure that workersare properly trained and that precautions are taken againstchemical poisoning, says a public interest group.   Public Citizen, a private environmental and consumerorganization, says its national survey found far too few state lawsand regulations aimed at protecting public health from hazardsposed by lawn care chemicals.   As a result, ``millions of Americans may be unwittingly exposedto potentially dangerous pesticides in their own back yards,'' saidLaura Weiss, who wrote Public Citizen's report on the survey.   For example, the report said, nearly two-thirds of the stateshave no requirement for either training or testing lawn careemployees. Two-thirds do not require that customers be providedwith information on potential hazards of the chemicals used. Only ahandful require notice before a lawn is treated or a warning thatit has been treated.   Ms. Weiss also was the author of a recent report maintainingthat many of the chemicals used by the lawn care industry have thepotential of causing long-term health problems including cancer,birth defects, liver, kidney or nerve damage as well as short-termailments.   The industry has defended its use of the chemicals, saying thecompanies only use them in accordance with safety instructionssupplied by the manufacturers and that the chemicals are approvedby the Environmental Protection Agency for lawn care use.   ``We have to be registered and certified in most states,'' saidJames Brooks, a spokesman for the Professional Lawn CareAssociation.   But Ms. Weiss says in her new report that while the EPA approveschemicals and doses that may be used on lawns, some of thestandards may be outdated and there is little federal regulation ofcompanies that actually apply the chemicals.   Federal regulations, for example, allow any company employee toapply chemicals as long as the worker is under the supervision of aperson who is certified, but the certified employee need notactually be present when the treatment is applied.   For the most part, government regulation is just as lacking onthe state level, although the commercial lawn care industry hasgrown into a $1.5 billion business servicing more than 7 millionhouseholds a year, the report said.   ``Most states have failed to take the necessary steps to protectpublic health from the hazards associated with law carepesticides,'' said Joan Claybrook, president of Public Citizen.   Here are some of the findings, according to the Public Citizensurvey:   Only six states require both that advance notice be given ofscheduled lawn treatment and that signs be posted afterward. Thosestates are Maryland, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Jersey, NewYork and Rhode Island.   Maine and Iowa require the warning signs, but no advance notice,while New Hampshire and Pennsylvania require the advance notice butno post-treatment warning signs.   A dozen states require lawn care company employees to pass astate test. Those states are Arizona, Connecticut, Illinois,Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico,Tennessee, Utah and Wisconsin.   Only in Indiana and Utah are lawn care employees required to beboth trained and tested under state-supervised programs.   In most states consumers also are left without detailedexplanations of the potential hazards associated with lawn carechemicals, said Ms. Weiss.   Only Massachusetts, New York and Maryland require stateinformation sheets to be provided to customers. Seventeen otherstates have some form of consumer information requirement, but inmany cases that amounts to merely providing the names of thepesticides being used, the report said.   ``This is inadequate because pesticide labels are oftendifficult, if not impossible, to understand and do not tell thefull story about a chemical's known or potential chronic healtheffects,'' said Ms. Weiss.</TEXT></DOC>
