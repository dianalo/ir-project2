More than 100,000 people marched for democracy in five EastGerman cities.   A Parliament committee rejected a draft law allowing up to 30days of travel abroad just a day after it was published, and saidunrestricted travel should be permitted.   The 44-member Cabinet, called the Council of Ministers, resignedjointly, said government spokesman Wolfgang Meyer. The council, ledby 75-year-old Premier Willi Stoph, implements policy made by theCommunist Party Politburo.   Stoph and several other ministers are Politburo members.   ``We appeal to the citizens who intend to leave our republic toreconsider their step once more,'' the council said in a statement.``Our socialist fatherland needs everyone.''   More than 28,000 East Germans have fled to West Germany throughneighboring Czechoslovakia since Saturday _ they arrived Tuesday atthe rate of 120 an hour. About 175,000, more than 1 percent of thepopulation, have left the country this year by legal or illegalmeans.   The Council of Ministers will remain in office until Parliamentelects a new one, Meyer said, but did not say when that would occur.The party Central Committee was to meet Wednesday to considerfurther changes.   West German political leaders in Bonn applauded Tuesday'sresignations but said only democratic reforms will quell unrest inthe communist nation.   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's chief of staff, Rudolf Seiters, said,``If I am correctly gauging the will of the people, they will not becontent with a few personnel changes, they will continue demanding agenuinely new political course.''   Volker Ruehe, general secretary of Kohl's Christian Democrats,said free elections now must follow.   ``This move clearly reflects the mounting pressure for realdemocracy and freedom,'' Britain's Foreign Office said. ``Thegovernment did not have popular support. They have recognized thisby resigning.''   Roman Popadiuk, deputy White House deputy press secretary, saidin Washington: ``If it leads to a process of reform, it can be apositive development.''   Several Communist Party officials and three small parties alliedwith the Communists urged the resignation of the Politburo itself,which met on Tuesday.   Leaders ``should resign without any delay'' to make way for a newPolitburo and government to carry out reforms, said the newspaperJunge Welt, organ of the Communist youth organization.   Egon Krenz, who replaced his mentor Erich Honecker, 77, as partyleader last month, has said five elderly Politburo members closelyassociated with Honecker will be replaced by the end of the week.Two other Politburo members lost their jobs when Krenz took overOct. 18.   The Politburo, which normally has 21 members, also discussed an``action program'' Krenz has said would contain sweeping politicaland economic reforms.   Guenter Krusche, a senior Lutheran Church leader in East Berlin,called for immediate ``secret and free elections'' for a newgovernment.   About 5,000 people marched in East Berlin on Tuesday to demandfree elections and challenge the Communist monopoly on power. Policedid not interfere with the protesters, who shouted: ``All power tothe people!''   ADN, the official news agency, said 50,000 people rallied inWismar, on the Baltic coast; 35,000-40,000 in Nordhausen, nearErfurt; and 20,000 in Meiningen.   Guntram Erdmann of New Forum, the largest opposition group, toldthe Wismar crowd his organization seeks ``peaceful transformation toa democratic state.''   On Monday, 750,000 demonstrators marched, about 500,000 inLeipzig alone.   East German leaders have been promising democratic reforms andfreer travel in hopes of halting unrest, but the draft law appearedto satisfy no one.   In rejecting the law in its current form, ADN said, the committeedeclared: ``The proposal does not meet the expectations of citizens... and will not achieve the political credibility of the state.''   The panel recommended eliminating the need for exit visas,separating travel regulations from emigration rules, clarifying theaccess to foreign currency for trips abroad, reconsidering the30-day limit and changing grounds on which passports can be refused.   It also recommended an emergency Parliament session to find waysof persuading citizens to remain at home. The latest tide ofemigration began early Saturday when departure was permitted throughCzechoslovakia, the only country to which East Germans can travelfreely.   Opening Czechoslovakia created the first free passage to the Westsince the Berlin Wall was built in August 1961. Authorities havesaid the route will remain open until a new travel law takes effect.</TEXT></DOC>
