Riot police stood guard along main streets and ringed the U.S.Embassy and government buildings. Students who tried to attend therally at city hall were arrested.   There were no reports of clashes.   Police headquarters said about 300 radical students werearrested, although most would be released.   Student groups called for a week of protests in Seoul and othercities to demand withdrawal of the 43,000 U.S. troops based inSouth Korea under a mutual defense treaty. Radical leaders say theUnited States props up authoritarian rule in South Korea.   Troops conducted spot checks on many streets, questioning andsearching people and taking away suspects. Police patrols roamedsubway stations in the city center to stop students from gathering.   Earlier Tuesday, radical students staged peaceful protests at 16colleges in the capital in a second day of anti-American protests.Students marched or held rallies, but there were no reports offighting.   Students at Sungkyunkwang University tried to push through riotpolice. They wore costumes to symbolize U.S. nuclear and chemicalweapons.   ``Drive out the Yankees!'' and ``Down with the dictatorship!''protesters chanted.   The Foreign Ministry Tuesday criticized radical students forburning U.S. flags during campus protests a day earlier.   ``Defaming a nation's flag is a deplorable act,'' said ministryspokesman Chang Hoon.   Besides withdrawal of U.S. troops, students were calling for theUnited States to apologize for its part in the bloody suppressionof a 1980 uprising in the southern city of Kwangju.   The uprising in Kwangju was put down by South Korean troops andat least 192 people died. Radical groups claim the United Statesmasterminded the operation.   Dissidents want the overthrow of President Roh Tae-woo'sgovernment, but they lack significant public support because oftheir violent tactics and extreme views.   South Korean and U.S. officials say American forces are neededto ensure Seoul's defense against North Korea.</TEXT></DOC>
