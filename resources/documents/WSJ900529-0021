The 43-year-old Mr. Gaviria emerged as the clear winner inSunday's elections, polling almost twice as many votes asconservative dissident Alvaro Gomez. Antonio Navarro, theleader of the M-19 guerrilla-group-turned-political-party,produced a surprise that could portend a politicalrealignment by outpolling conservative Rodrigo Lloreda andfinishing third with about 13% of the vote.</LP><TEXT>   But Mr. Gaviria's victory was weakened somewhat by aturnout of only 45%. This indicated that a campaign ofintimidation through murders and bombings, waged by thecountry's drug barons and guerrilla groups, was largelysuccessful -- raising questions about the strength of Mr.Gaviria's mandate to pursue the drug war.   The boyish Mr. Gaviria becomes Colombia's youngestpresident, succeeding Virgilio Barco, who launched the war ondrugs last August after presidential contender Luis CarlosGalan was gunned down while campaigning.   Mr. Gaviria, who headed Mr. Galan's campaign after servingas Mr. Barco's finance minister and interior minister, pickedup the mantle and emerged as the toughest of the four majorcandidates on the drug issue. At the same time, he wants tocontinue the peace process with guerrilla groups, whosecrimes he views differently from those of drug traffickers.   In his acceptance speech at a Bogota hotel, Mr. Gaviriavowed that his government would bring drug-related terrorism&quot;to its knees.&quot; But he mixed this confident prediction with awarning that Colombians were tiring of the heavy burden ofthe drug war and could only keep fighting it if they got moreinternational support.   &quot;Drug trafficking is a multilateral problem, andindustrialized countries aren't doing much to confront theproblem of drug consumption,&quot; he said. &quot;If they don't dothis, it will become increasingly difficult for the Colombianpeople to understand that their sacrifice isn't beingmatched.&quot;   In an interview shortly before his victory, Mr. Gaviriamade clear he wanted help to go beyond the traditional U.S.response of military support; he urged strong efforts tocombat money laundering and weapons trafficking. In addition,he asked for economic compensation in the form of more openU.S. markets for Colombian products, citing the estimated $1billion that Colombia spent last year in its war on drugs.   &quot;Economic aid and military equipment are important,&quot; Mr.Gaviria said, &quot;but the Colombian people hope that in some waythe great economic effort that the country is making will berewarded by making it easier for our products to enter theinternational market.&quot;   He cited flowers and coffee as Colombian exports thatought to be allowed greater access. U.S. officials say theyexpect trade to emerge as a contentious issue with theGaviria administration, although Mr. Gaviria says he'scommitted to continuing the progressive opening of theColombian economy begun by Mr. Barco.   Another issue likely to surface is the extradition of drugsuspects to the U.S. Mr. Barco has used extradition as hismain instrument in the fight against Colombia's drug barons,but Mr. Gaviria says it should be &quot;a complementary policy,not a principal instrument.&quot; Mr. Gaviria proposes, instead,to undertake a broad effort to strengthen Colombia's judicialsystem to enable it to try drug traffickers.   Colombians also voted overwhelmingly Sunday in favor ofnaming a constituent assembly to revise the country's104-year-old constitution.</TEXT></DOC>
