(1) Amplification factors of horizontal componentin ground surface is about 3 to 4 times against the bedrock. Contrastivelyon the structure, any amplification is not observed at the undergroundportion, however, little amplification exists at the ground portion ofstructure. (2) Transfer function of structure has several predominantpeaks at frequencies of 4.3 Hz and 8.0 Hz which are well coincided withvalues obtained from force excitation tests. It is shown that transferfunction between basement and ground surface is similar to that betweenground of same level to basement and ground surface, suggesting the behaviorof basement to be able to estimate by these under ground earthquake motion.(3) According to earthquake motion analysis using S-R models, withoutregard to consider or not the side ground stiffness, the calculated responsevalues do not so much differ in each model and mostly correspond withobservation data, provided that the underground earthquake motion atsame level to basement is used as a input wave. Consequently, the behaviorof these deeply embedded structure is subject to setting method of inputwave rather than modeling method, and it is very useful in design thatthe most simple model without side ground stiffness can roughly representthe embedment effect.</TEXT></DOC>
