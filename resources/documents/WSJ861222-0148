In fact, it was the fifth time in four years that a mortgage-investment company in the state had shut down under similar circumstances.    But at least their misery has company. In Nevada and Arizona, some 3,500 investors are expected to lose about $38.5 million in the case of Reno, Nev.-based Lemons andamp; Associates Inc., a similar operation that went bust last year. Also last year, E.F. Hutton Group Inc. wrote off $14 million for losses anticipated from investments with First American Mortgage Co., a Baltimore company alleged to have sold the same second and third mortgages to many different investors. (Neither admitting nor denying guilt, First American's chairman has signed a consent agreement barring him from selling securities in Maryland for five years.)    Such operations, which have cropped up in at least a half dozen states, have been helped both by the growing popularity and complexity of the mortgage market and by the failure of regulation to keep pace. &quot;It is a new area,&quot; says Royce Griffin, Colorado securities commissioner and former president of the North American Securities Administrators Association. &quot;Mortgage-related securities of this kind are a serious problem and need regulation.&quot;    In the past, mortgages were used primarily to acquire a home. Banks and savings-and-loan associations traditionally made most of these loans and kept them for their own investment portfolios.    But in recent years, more homeowners have used their property for additional equity, either refinancing their mortgages or securing second or third mortgages. In 1985, $75 billion of second mortgages was originated, more than four times the amount in 1980. Moreover, mortgage companies are increasingly selling the loans to investors in the secondary market. That market more than tripled in the same five years, to $221 billion in 1985.    The vast majority of the growing mortgage business has been conducted by large, respected organizations. Almost all of the investors purchasing the mortgages have been companies or government agencies such as the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. Those buyers' strict standards are considered a sufficient check on the integrity of the sellers.    However, a sister industry of unknown size has sprouted alongside the institutional business -- made up of companies that, like Diamond/Obie, sell home loans almost exclusively to individuals. (Diamond/Obie in fact sold some mortgages to Fannie Mae, but the agency says it terminated the relationship in May 1985, declining to comment further.) Some of these companies, including Diamond/Obie, sell single mortages to individuals, while others sell shares in a pool of mortgages.    Financial regulators around the country note that inexperienced individuals haven't the resources of a government agency to scrutinize such mortgage-investment purchases and have few protections. While states have long regulated traditional securities, only 17 -- including Florida, New York, New Jersey and Kentucky -- have regulations directly affecting companies that make mortgages, and even fewer have rules governing firms that make only second mortgages, according to the Washington-based Mortgage Bankers Association of America. On the investment side, many states exempt companies that sell whole mortgages to individuals from registering what they sell.    While some states do have laws, many of them are fairly lax, and often there is little funding for enforcement. A new Arizona statute, for example, requires the state to inspect mortgage companies once every five years. But as there are more than 800 such firms -- and only 16 examiners to handle them as well as other companies -- meeting even that minimal standard is a problem, says Mary C. Short, the state superintendent of banks. &quot;We're still understaffed,&quot; she says.    Although tougher laws would probably help, many investment specialists say the best defense is skepticism on the part of the buyer. In many of the frauds, investors could have protected themselves simply by making sure they had the mortgage documents, and by contacting the person whose mortgage they supposedly owned.    &quot;People are too trusting,&quot; says Jeffrey L. Hartman, one of the attorneys helping the state to sort out the Lemons case. &quot;They won't spend $100 to get an attorney or an accountant to advise them a little bit, then they lose their life savings.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
