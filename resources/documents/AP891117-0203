The artwork crafted by the 55-year-old Wong and the 1,200 or soother ivory carvers in Hong Kong has long been popular.   Wholesalers from the United States, Europe and Japan haveeagerly snapped up tons of ivory worked in Hong Kong. Shop windowsin tourist districts display works ranging from panormaiclandscapes carved from an entire tusk to delicate earrings.   But now the centuries-old craft may be doomed.   In Octber, the Convention on International Trade in EndangeredSpecies (CITES) adopted a ban on world ivory trading to saveAfrica's dwindling elephant population, which has dropped from 1.5million in the 1970s to an estimated 600,000 now _ victims ofpoachers after their tusks.   The ban gives ivory traders until Jan. 18 to sell their stocks.But Hong Kong companies say they will need much longer to sell 670tons of ivory, the world's largest known stockpile, worth about$128 million.   Wong estimates the value of his own uncarved ivory at about$25,600 and said he has no idea what to do. ``It'll take at leastfive years to carve it all.''   Local traders are lobbying the government in this British colonyto allow them to continue sales past the January deadline and arescrambling to figure out how to save their industry.   ``Between the elephants and the carvers, who do you think shouldbe protected?'' asked an angry Dominic Ng, a leading ivory trader.   Ng suggests the government forbid the import of more tusks butallow the carving and export of the existing stockpile until theban is reviewed in 1991 by CITES.   But since the United States, Japan and other major ivory importmarkets are upholding the ban, it is not clear how much such apolicy would help the industry in Hong Kong. The only legal marketfor traders would be smaller countries that do not belong to CITESor refuse to go along with the ban.   The Hong Kong government has indicated it will abide by thetrade ban, and officials are considering vocational training forcarvers thrown out of work.   But Wong is skeptical about retraining workers.   ``Ivory carvers usually do not have much education,'' he said.``It is too late for them to learn another skill and doing otherodd jobs will barely make ends meet.''   The government also has promised to seek support for thecreation of an international fund to buy up the ivory stockpile inHong Kong.   Local traders are demanding compensation for their stockpile,which they say consists of ivory that was purchased with approvalby CITES before it imposed the ban.   A government survey found 93 percent of the ivory in Hong Kongcontains valid CITES certification, but conservationists argue muchof the stockpile comes from the tusks of poached elephants that theconvention has nonetheless allowed onto the market.   Nicholas Pirie, chairman of the local branch of the RoyalSociety for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, says the HongKong ivory must be destroyed.   If ivory exports were permitted to continue, it would be easyfor more poached ivory to be smuggled into the colony and claimedas part of the original stockpile, Pirie argues.   ``I sympathize with the workers but I don't sympathize with thebosses,'' he said.   At his workshop, in an old residential building, Wongmethodically works on a six-inch-high elephant figure, using a tinydrill to carve wrinkles in the animal's feet. The project will takeup to three weeks.   Such craftsmanship has been an integral part of Chinese art forcenturies. But Wong believes the long history of ivory carving inHong Kong, now the main center for such work, is reaching an endwith or without the ban.   ``Who wants to learn how to carve ivory nowadays?'' he said,explaining it takes five years of apprenticeship and pays onlyabout $500 a month.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Thursday AMs, Nov. 23</NOTE></DOC>
