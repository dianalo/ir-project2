Their attitudes range from Romantic contempt-- Wordsworth's &quot;We murder to dissect&quot; -- to the snobbery ofOxford dandies who used to refer to the subject as &quot;Stinks.&quot;The big gulf between the scientific community and thehumanities crowd, already noted by thescientist-turned-novelist C.P. Snow in his famous &quot;TwoCultures&quot; lecture in 1959, has not gotten any smaller.   &quot;A Literary Guide to Science&quot; (Norton, 517 pages, $24.95)is the latest ecumenical gesture on the part of sciencetoward the literary world. Its editor, Walter Gratzer, is aresearcher in biophysics at London University, who must alsohave been doing rather a lot of bedtime reading over theyears. Here he has compiled more than 200 excerpts fromnovels, memoirs, biographies, plays, reportage and verse,plus a few complete short stories -- that represent&quot;incursions of science into literature.&quot; Each is preceded bya pithy introduction. Although the selection is heavilyweighted toward the 20th century, he's not forgotten aboutSwift, Pope, Byron, Flaubert and Samuel Butler. There isalmost no science fiction, which by and large is neither veryliterary nor very scientific.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;A Literary Guide&quot; is well-leavened with comedy, beginningwith an amusing account by James Thurber of his inability tosee absolutely anything through a microscope, to the immenseannoyance of his botany professor. Only after a year oftrying every conceivable adjustment of the instrument did hefinally manage to record an image of &quot;a variegatedconstellation of flecks, specks, and dots,&quot; which he took forplant cells until his enraged instructor pointed out thatThurber had drawn a reflection of his own eye.   Elsewhere in the book we are treated to the spectacle ofRenaissance astronomer Tycho Brahe's tame elk imbibing toomuch beer and falling fatally down some stairs; ofarchbishops struggling with books on relativity theory (onlyto be told by Einstein that &quot;it is a purely scientific matterand has nothing to do with religion&quot;); and of AlexanderGraham Bell trying to get the dying President Garfield toswallow a light bulb so that the assassin's bullet inside hisbody could be located.   Otherworldly though scientists are reputed to be, here wesee them acting all too human, both in fact and in fiction.They sabotage one another's experiments, steal credit fordiscoveries, bicker about the order of authors' names onscientific papers, develop neurotic obsessions with the NobelPrize, and get duped by psychics; one even pronounces nuclearas &quot;nucular,&quot; just like Jimmy Carter.   A particularly unattractive physicist named Otto Warburgaccepts the status of &quot;honorary Aryan&quot; from the Nazis so thathe can remain in his Berlin laboratory even though he is halfJewish. Asked by a journalist how he felt about the chargethat he was &quot;a great scientist but a rotten human being,&quot;Warburg replied without a twinkle in his eye: &quot;I am glad theydo not say the other way around.&quot;   More appealing is the rounded character portrait drawn ofthat towering British physiologist J.B.S. Haldane -- who wasalso a classics scholar, an ardent communist, a war hero anda wag. We are given engaging views of the man frombiographies, memoirs, and from Aldous Huxley's novel &quot;AnticHay,&quot; in which he was a character. Also included is asurprisingly good short story by Haldane himself, a drylywitty thriller about a conspiracy to extract gold from seawater.   Pop topics are not scanted by &quot;A Literary Guide.&quot; Thosewho have forgotten about Kurt Vonnegut's &quot;ice-nine&quot; will finda brief refresher from his &quot;Cat's Cradle,&quot; plus anotheraccount by Mr. Vonnegut of how the idea for thisocean-congealing substance was first offered by a GeneralElectric scientist to H.G. Wells, who declined to makefictional use of it. Wilhelm Reich's notorious orgone box,which was supposed to do everything from healing wounds toimproving orgasms, gets sent up by that great puncturer ofscience frauds, Martin Gardner.   Mr. Gratzer admits that he may have omitted worthy stuffdue to ignorance, but how did he come to ignore Joyce andNabokov? Did science touch their writing? It did. Nabokov'smemoirs include a marvelous account of his scientificfascination with butterflies. Joyce devoted an entire episodeof &quot;Ulysses&quot; to the theme of science and coined the term&quot;quark&quot; (used by physicists to denote the basic buildingblocks of matter) in &quot;Finnegans Wake.&quot;   There are sins of commission as well as omission: Many ofthe excerpts Mr. Gratzer has included from forgottenscientific novels are too brief to achieve critical mass, andare written in less than delicious prose. But the average ispushed up well above the purchase threshold by literary gemsfrom the likes of Primo Levi, Michael Frayn and John Updike,who plainly knows as much about contemporary physics as hedoes about Kierkegaard and funky sex. With items such as hischarming bit of doggerel about neutrinos streaming throughthe bodies of lovers in Nepal, this guide ought to keep eventhe most jaded literary aesthete amused.   ---   Mr. Holt, a lapsed mathematician, is the New Yorkcolumnist for London's Literary Spectator.</TEXT></DOC>
