Inc. has received a patent for a new family ofthallium-lead materials that superconduct at 120-125 degrees Kelvin, thehighest temperature yet in superconducting compounds.andM;Dupont hopes to have products ready for commercialization &quot;as soon as anyother [high-temperature superconducting] materials,&quot; said Lloyd Guggenberger,research manager for high-temperature superconductivity materials at DuPont's Central Research and Development Lab.andM;Budget newsandM;The leve of activity at the federal government level has returned to itsnormal harried pace.andP;  President Bush's budget for F/Y 1991 was submitted lastmonth and contains general increases for science and technology issues,particularly big science items such as the Superconducting Super Collider(from $218 million to $318 million) and the human genome project ($154million to be split between the Department of Energy and the NationalInstitutes of Health.andM;Other increases are a 28-percent jump for robotics, from $150 million to $192million.andP;  Semiconductor research will increase from $525 million to $537million, which includes $100 million for Sematech.andP;  Advanced imagingtechnologies funding will remain at $118 million, which includes $12 millionfor high-definition systems research.andM;However, an area that did not receive the boost expected was thehigh-performance interstate computing network proposal, which received only a5 percent increase over last year, for a total of $469 million.andM;The Office of Science and Technology Policy, for which the administrationrecommended an increase from $2.8 million to $3.3 million, is puttingtogether an integrated national program that maintains the components of theoriginal concept: high-performance computers; a fiber optic netowrk &quot;thatmakes the capability of those computers available across the country to smallbusiness and large, to schools and homes;&quot; user-friendly software &quot;that makesit possible for a great many more users than is now the case to usehigh-performance computing;&quot; and the manpower required to operate the system,said D. Allan Bromley, White House Science Advisor.andM;National Science FoundationandM;Erich Bloch is considering leaving his post as director of the NationalScience Foundation before his term ends in September.andP;  Block, who wasappointed director in 1984, is frustrated with budget disputes and politicalinfighting, and believes it is time to move on, NSF sources said.andP;  AT thepacked press conference releasing the Bush budget, Bloch deflected questionsregarding his departure with humor and declined to comment.andM;Bloch, a former IBM executive, is one of the first industralists to run NSF.andO;His efforts to double the agency's budget by 1992 will fall short.andP;  Theagency has pushedpack its doubled budget timetable until F/Y 1994.andP;  The Bushbudget for F/Y 1991 requested $2.38 billion, for a 14.4 percent increasecompared to F/Y 1990.andM;National Institute of Standards and TechnologyandM;The budget contains a $36.5-million increase for the National Institute ofStandards and Technology (NIST) based on existing appropriations of $198.4million.andP;  The four areas to be affected most at NIST, a division of theCommerce Dept., are process and quality control through chemicalmeasurements; information technologies; electronic technology; andintelligent machines and processors.andM;Department of DefenseandM;The Defense Dept.andP;  plans to earmark $80 million for four different industriesduring the next five years to combat a decline in manufacturing areasessential to national security.andP;  Funds will be targeted at advancedtechnologies to boost U.S.andP;  competitiveness in the apparel, food processing,optics and precision-gear industries.andP;  Pentagon officials said they willprovide funds to help start industry/academic research and developmentconsortia.andP;  Industry is expected to match or exceed the DOD grant.andM;The five-year breakdown of the Pentagon's investment is expected to include$35 million for optics.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
