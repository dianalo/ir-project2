Within this research project,electromechanical converters with permanent magnet excitation are tobe verified for their possible suitability for use as directly drivengenerators in speed-variable wind power plants. Direct drive allows todispense with gears which are prone to wear and high maintenance andwhich are commonly used to convert the low turbine speed to a high generatorspeed. Permanent magnets allow to excite both direct current and synchronousgenerators. Application of a synchronous generator allows to eliminatethose drawbacks as go along with the mechanical commutator of the d.c.generator.</TEXT></DOC>
