The DOE-2 energy analysis simulation program was used togenerate a data base of the electric energy requirements of a prototypicaloffice building module located in Singapore. Algebraic expressions derivedby multiple regression techniques permitted a direct comparison of thoseparameters that characterize window performance in hot and humid climates:orientation, size, and solar-optical properties. Also investigated werethe effects of exterior and interior shading devices, as well as interiorilluminance level, power density, and lighting controls to permit theuse of daylighting. These regression equations were used to compare theenergy implications of conventional window designs and newer designsin which the type of coating and substrate were varied. The analysisshows the potential for substantial savings through combined solar loadcontrol and lighting energy use reduction with daylighting.</TEXT></DOC>
