In a report last week on U.S.-Japanese negotiations, Japanpromised to spend more money on public works, reform businesspractices that limit competition, and change tax laws to make morecommercial land available at lower prices. A final and moredetailed report is due in July.   The government could run into resistance from the oppositionSocialists, owners of small businesses, and corporate groups thathave cozy relationships.   ``I don't know how long it will take before the effects begin toshow up,'' said Noriko Hama of Mitsubishi Research Institute.   ``A lot of political and administrative problems have to becleared up. We are just standing at the front door,'' she added.   In recent years, Japan's sales in the United States haveexceeded U.S. sales in Japan by about $50 billion a year.   Immediate promises include increased public works spending inthe budget for the fiscal year that began April 1. Under Japaneselaw, the governing Liberal Democratic Party's majority in the lowerhouse of Parliament is enough to ensure it has its way in decidingthe budget.   They also include an easing of restrictions on opening newlarge-scale retail stores, tighter enforcement of anti-monopolylaws and a close inspection of preferential supply arrangementsamong groups of companies.   Some of the provisions on stores, however, would requireapproval by Parliament. Even within the governing party, there isconcern about alienating traditional party supporters among Japan's1.6 million small retailers.   ``The large-scale retail stores law and so on involve verydifficult domestic political elements, so I am not so optimistic asto the prospect of gaining consensus or endorsement from thecongress. As far as the administration is concerned, we aredetermined to do whatever we made public,'' said Taizo Watanabe,the Foreign Ministry's spokesman.   Local governments also could maintain regulations to protectsmaller retailers from competition by big stores. U.S. officialssay the present law is a barrier to foreign stores and that largerJapanese stores are more likely to carry foreign products.   Large retailers have welcomed the proposed changes but havenoted that high land prices, a labor shortage and risingconstruction costs could frustrate expansion plans.   Over the longer term, Japan pledged efforts to solve tax lawsand other regulations that keep some land underutilized and driveup prices; increase fines for anti-monopoly law violations; lookinto simplifying merger and acquisition procedures; and formulate a10-year plan of increased spending on such things as housing,sewers, parks, airports and port facilities.   It also said, however, that year-by-year public works spendingwould be decided flexibly to avoid inflation and overheating theeconomy.   The leading opposition party, the Socialist Party, has supportedbigger public works spending but added that ``it must beconcentrated on improving the people's livelihood.'' It also hasfavored a greater role for local governments in retail storeregulations.   Enforcement of the anti-monopoly laws and the new task ofregular checks on Japan's ``keiretsu,'' or corporate groups, woulddepend on the Fair Trade Commission, an agency that so far has notenjoyed high status and has not rushed to prosecute offenders.   Agency figures for the fiscal years 1984-1988 show no criminalcharges filed. In fiscal 1988, the commission looked into 180cases, and in only five told companies that they were violating thelaw and had to stop.   Japan pledged that the commission would more actively presscriminal charges and said its fiscal 1990 budget calls forexpanding the number of investigators to 154 from the present 129.   Meanwhile, it said the commission would take steps againstexclusionary practices uncovered in analyses to be conducted ofkeiretsu activities.   Some Japanese say these groups of companies that hold eachother's stock and supply each other with goods and servicesactually are like a major U.S. corporation, such as General Motors,composed of many divisions.   U.S. officials and businessmen complain that transactions withinsuch groups freeze out foreign suppliers, and the groups' structuremakes it hard for foreigners to invest in Japan.   On the question of dealings based on personal ties, MasahikoIshizuka, an editorial writer for the economic newspaper NihonKeizai Shimbun, quoted one Japanese executive as saying of hiscustomers, ``As long as face-to-face relations remain intact,prices are irrelevant. They will continue to buy from usirrespective of prices, virtually shutting out newcomers.''</TEXT></DOC>
