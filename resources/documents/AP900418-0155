Marcos.   The disclosure came as Imelda Marcos' attorney questionedPotenciano Roque, a U.S. government witness called to describe thediscovery of financial records at the Marcos residence in Manilaafter she and her husband fled the country in February 1986.   Mrs. Marcos is on trial in U.S. District Court on charges ofusing embezzled money to buy New York properties and finance alavish lifestyle.   Roque was an aide to Joker Arroyo, a Manila civil rights lawyerand Mrs. Aquino's former personal secretary, from 1986 until lastyear.   The diamonds suddenly came up after a morning of testimony aboutdocuments prosecutors say will help show that the Marcoses divertedmoney to Swiss bank accounts and other personal uses.   ``Did you ever give Mrs. Aquino a package of diamonds?'' Mrs.Marcos' attorney, Gerald Spence, asked Roque.   After a pause, Roque replied, ``Yes.''   ``How many diamonds?'' asked Spence.   ``Six to ten.''   ``Did you take a receipt for them?'' the attorney said.   ``No,'' Roque said.   Roque didn't tell the jury where he found the diamonds, butSpence said in a conference away from the jury that the witnessdiscovered the packet among documents at Malacanang Palace. Spencewas concerned that if he raised that matter in front of jurors, itcould open the door for prosecutors to introduce evidence aboutother jewels.   Under questioning by Assistant U.S. Attorney Charles LaBella,Roque testified that he had given ``eight to ten'' diamonds in asmall plastic packet to Mrs. Aquino in her office and that she hadinstructed her daughter, Corazon Cruz, who is also her personalsecretary, to call the Central Bank.   Roque gave no other details about the incident.   However, documents newly admitted into evidence refer to jewelrypurchased by Mrs. Marcos in New York.   Spence said Tuesday that he believed a government witness thenon the stand would have testified, had she been asked byprosecutors, that jewelry had been taken from the palace after theMarcoses left.   ``And I think we can show that jewelry has since been identifiedand seen ... on both Mrs. Aquino and relatives,'' he said.   The witness, Angelita Reyes, had told how she helped gatherdocuments at the palace and later turned them over to thePresident's Commission on Good Government, which Aquino created totry to recover money allegedly stolen by the Marcoses.   Judge John F. Keenan said that since U.S. prosecutors hadindicated they didn't plan to introduce other evidence concerningjewelry, he saw no reason to hold Reyes for further testimony.   Mrs. Aquino's government is trying to recover millions ofdollars the Marcoses allegedly stole from their country's treasuryduring 20 years in power.</TEXT></DOC>
