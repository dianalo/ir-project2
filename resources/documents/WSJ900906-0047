Statistics Canada, a federal agency, estimated yesterdaythat the Canadian wheat crop, which is being harvested now,will total 28.58 million metric tons, a 17% increase from24.33 million tons last year. This would be thesecond-largest Canadian wheat crop after the 1986 record cropof 31.38 million tons. A metric ton of wheat is equal to36.74 bushels.</LP><TEXT>   Canada is the second-largest wheat exporter after theU.S., and the two countries compete aggressively in many ofthe same wheat markets. &quot;The Canadian Wheat Board will priceits grain at whatever level is needed to move it,&quot; said ShawnMcComb, international grain analyst at the WEFA Group, aresearch organization. The board, a government agency,handles exports of western Canadian wheat and barley.   Brian Stacey, the board's spokesman, said grain marketconditions are &quot;very tough&quot; because of big crops in manycountries. But he said the board doesn't dump grain belowmarket prices.   Mr. McComb estimated that Canada's wheat exports will riseto 19.3 million metric tons in the year ending next July 31from 17.16 million tons in the previous year, despite toughcompetition from other wheat exporters.   Statistics Canada estimated that Canadian spring wheatproduction this year will rise 21% to 22.97 million metrictons. Spring wheat, which is seeded in the spring andharvested in the fall, is Canada's main wheat crop. Durumwheat production is expected to decline 4% this year to 3.93million tons. Durum is used to make pasta products.   Patricia Mohr, Bank of Nova Scotia economist, said thewheat board's asking export price for wheat has dropped toUS$137 a metric ton from US$206 a year ago. She said exportprices aren't covering the cost of the board's initialpayments to farmers and transportation to port. The boardmakes initial payments to farmers based on its assessment ofmarket prospects early in the year.   Statistics Canada estimated Canada's barley crop willincrease 11% this year to 12.9 million metric tons. Canada'sexports of barley will be hurt by the blockade of Iraq, whichwas Canada's largest barley purchaser. A metric ton of barleyis equal to 45.93 bushels.   Production of canola, or rapeseed, is expected to rise6.1% to 3.3 million metric tons this year, despite a 9%decline in canola acreage. Canola is Canada's major oilseedcrop. A metric ton of canola equals 44.09 bushels.   Statistics Canada said a cool, wet spring slowed cropdevelopment this year. But it said that &quot;expectations are forgood yields in most regions.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
