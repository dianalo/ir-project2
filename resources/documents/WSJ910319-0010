The company's austere headquarters is tucked among publichousing projects, warehouses and factories in Hong Kongisland's industrialized northeast corner. Access to themanagement floors is confined to a service elevator. Theboard room is unadorned except for a portrait of ChairmanWang Seng-liang, and a wall display of the company'sprototype motors, most no larger than a spool of thread.</LP><TEXT>   But there is nothing austere about Johnson Electric'ssteady earnings growth, which rose to 173 million Hong Kongdollars (US$22.2 million) last year from HK$94 million in1986. Institutional investors, hungry for solid, long-termperformers, have pushed its share price up nearly 25% in thepast two months, despite its premium to the Hong Kongmarket's average price-earnings ratio. The stock is tradingat about 10.8 times prospective earnings, according toanalysts, compared with the Hang Seng index's 9.5 level.   &quot;Overall, in terms of management, it's a very goodcompany,&quot; says Alex Ho, an analyst for Jardine FlemingSecurities Ltd. &quot;It's the darling of Western fund managers.&quot;   Since it was founded by the elder Mr. Wang 32 years ago asa producer of motors for toys, Johnson Electric has become aworld leader in its field without a boost from governmentsubsidies, unlike its competitors in Singapore, Taiwan andSouth Korea.   The Johnson Electric group now controls 11 subsidiarycompanies locally and overseas. While most localmanufacturers dismiss long-term investment as too costly --and politically risky, with China due to regain sovereigntyover Hong Kong in 1997 -- the group has emerged as one ofHong Kong's few industrial producers with in-house researchand development and its own global distribution network.   The group invests 4% of its total sales in research anddevelopment, led by a team of 150 engineers. Extensive officeautomation last year enabled Johnson Electric to cut its HongKong assembly staff by 50% and its China staff by one-third.To ease capacity constraints, the company has said it willopen a factory, dormitory and office facility this year inThailand that Mr. Wang says will eventually account for 15%to 20% of output.   After a decade of solid growth, the company posted flatsales and earnings results last year because of substantialcapital investments and a HK$16 million loss on itsforeign-currency holdings.   However, analysts are forecasting after-tax earnings forthe year ending March 31 will rise by about 18% to more thanHK$200 million, reflecting reduced payrolls and thedevelopment of powerful new motors with more diverseapplications. The company should also benefit from theappreciation of its mark and yen holdings relative to theU.S. dollar, analysts said.   Micromotors are used in everything from model trains toautomobiles. The average car uses about 20 micromotors, whichpower windows, rear-view mirrors, door locks and headlamps.The technology is vital to motor drives in cameras, and tohome appliances such as sewing machines, cordless vacuumcleaners and electric toothbrushes.   Johnson Electric and its larger rival, Japan's MabuchiMotor Co., dominate the micromotor industry. As global demandfor smaller, lighter and more powerful tools and appliancesintensifies, so does the competition to develop motors thatcan drive them. For example, the company recently scored amajor victory over Mabuchi by developing a motor about 3.8centimeters in diameter and strong enough to power ahand-held hammer drill that can pound concrete into rubble.   &quot;The long-term perspective for the industry isencouraging,&quot; says Paul McKenzie, an analyst with CreditLyonnais Securities (Asia) Ltd. &quot;In the U.S., for example,the car industry is pretty bad, but Johnson's sales held upbecause of the fact that there are more micromotors used percar.&quot;   The group has been slowly chipping away at the Japanesehome-appliance market, but so far it has been unsuccessful atpenetrating what Mr. Wang calls &quot;the holy grail,&quot; Japan'sauto industry.   &quot;But we will,&quot; says Mr. Wang, who holds a master's degreein electrical engineering from Purdue University. &quot;We'reattacking the center from the outside.&quot;   In addition to product development, the company hasinvested heavily in market research and distribution toincrease its exposure in the European Community, whichaccounts for 25% of total sales, and in North America, whichabsorbs 27%. As a result, analysts say, Johnson Electric ispositioned to exploit Europe's common market in 1992 and thetrading bloc that could emerge from free-trade agreementsbeing negotiated by Canada, the U.S. and Mexico. The groupopened a North American subsidiary in 1976 and a research,development and manufacturing plant in Switzerland in late1987. Hong Kong and China remain the company's biggestmarket, accounting for 35% of sales.   Despite its global network, Johnson Electric's corebusiness has changed little since it was established in 1959to make motors for toys. In 1967, the company began makingparts for model racing cars for Aurora Plastics Corp. A yearlater, Aurora bought 49% of Johnson Electric, which benefitedfrom the U.S. company's superior technology and resources.The company stagnated after Aurora was bought by RJR NabiscoInc. in the early 1970s, and the Wang family bought backAurora's stake.   A turning point came in 1972, when the group begandesigning and manufacturing alternating-current motors forhousehold appliances. It also started financing its ownresearch and development and was soon producing businessequipment, computer peripherals and disk drives. By the late'70s, Johnson Electric had become a major supplier for WestGermany's automobile industry. The company became listed onthe Hong Kong Stock Exchange in June 1984.   Large-scale growth came only after the opening of China,with its vast labor pool, to international business in 1979.   &quot;If it hadn't been for the opening of China, we would nothave been able to build up, because we couldn't have saved upso much money to put back into the company,&quot; says Mr. Wang.</TEXT></DOC>
