<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-61-0541 </DOCNO><TEXT>A defect in collagen metabolism has been suspected in the Marfan syndromebecause abnormally soluble collagen has been found in some patients withthis disorder. In 1981 others reported a 20-25 amino acid insertion inone of the pro-{alpha}2(I) collagen protein chains of a patient witharachnodactyly and cystic medial necrosis of the aorta. Protein studiesindicated that the peptide insertion was near the collagenase cleavagesite, which is between amino acids 775 and 776. The authors attemptedto determine the site and nature of this defect at the DNA level.</TEXT></DOC>
