The fact is that any question you're likely to ask, since you'retyping it online, will be pretty short and won't give tbe system much of aclue about what you really want.andP;  That's why, if you want to refine thesearch, you mark the headlines of the articles that most closely match whatyou are interested in and then tell it to redo the search.andP;  It then patternmatches the entire text of the marked stories against the text database andrefines its list of headlines.andP;  (You can also mark specific paragraphs in onestory as the basis for redoing the search.) Eventually, you get what youwant, as long as it exists in the publications that are contained in thedatabase, so you better want something related to business because that'swhat this database covers.andM;Dowquest is both rewarding and frustrating to use.andP;  Response time, even on afairly complex query (where you use a lot of ambiguous words to phrase thequestion), is amazingly fast, never more than a few seconds at 2400-bps frommy computer (wbich is talking to Dow Jones in Princeton from Californiathrough an MCI Mail gateway, presumably near Washington, DC).andP;  In otherwords, the Connection Machines are everything they're cracked up to be andthe pattem-matching software and design of tbe text database seem prettyefficient.andP;  As well, the service rarely gives you an error message, since itis set up to respond to &quot;natural language&quot;.andP;  Even if you type &quot;quit&quot;, it willtry to pattem matcb that word against its database.andP;  The major frustration isthat Dowquest doesn't actually answer your question.andP;  Instead it points youto a list of articles that may or may not match wbat your interest is.andP;  Ifthe headline doesn't tell you whether the article is a close match, you haveto begin reading the article.andP;  And the process becomes incredibly inefficientfor anybody in a hurry, which - almost by definition - includes most computerusers.andM;The net result: Dowquest is great if what you're trying to find out, is in anarea that you're unfamiliar with and you're not in a particular hurry.andP;  Thenyou can ask questions, refining the search by either marking relevant resultsor by re-phrasing the question, and follow a random path from wbat you knowto what you want to know.andP;  But that might take a little time and, at DowJones' business-oriented connection charges, a fair amount of money.andP;  Evenso, Dowquest is clearly a serious step forward toward the ultimate goal of afast, friendly, responsive, and tolerant system for exploring databases andacquiring new knowledge.andP;  Thank the heavens that Dow Jones thinks it's worththe money to invest in the system and figure out how to do it right.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
