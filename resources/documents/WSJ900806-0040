Investors, worried about the inflationary impact of risingoil prices, are shying away from buying long-term Treasurybonds, driving long-term interest rates higher.</LP><TEXT>   But convinced that the Federal Reserve may soon cutshort-term interest rates to revive a weakening economy, theyare snapping up short-term notes.   &quot;I think short-term rates will continue to go lower&quot; onexpectations that the Fed will ease credit, said MariaFiorini Ramirez, president of Maria Ramirez CapitalConsultants Inc., a unit of John Hancock Freedom Securities.   But even if the Fed reduces short-term interest rates, shesaid, long-term rates may spurt still higher on fears that aweak economy won't reduce stubborn inflation.   The bond market's schizophrenic behavior is showing upclearly in the gap between yields on two-year Treasury notesand 30-year bonds, which is now the widest it has been in twoyears.   Traders refer to this as a &quot;steepening yield curve,&quot; andeconomists generally regard it as a sign that investors havebecome jittery about the prospects of rising inflation.   Yields on two-year Treasury notes have fallen sharply inrecent weeks and now are about 7.8%. Meanwhile, yields on30-year Treasury bonds have risen slightly to about 8.56%.The difference between the short-term and the long-termyields, which is called the yield spread, is about 3/4percentage point. Ms. Ramirez said the spread is likely towiden to one full percentage point.   The yield curve had been slowly steepening for severalweeks as short-term interest rates fell faster than long-termrates. But last week, when Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait,investors made a mad dash for short-term Treasury securities,buying up three-month and six-month bills as well astwo-year, three-year and five-year Treasury notes.   &quot;Nobody was willing to sell&quot; short-term securities, saidJames Capra, a senior vice president at Shearson LehmanGovernment Securities Inc.   Some of the buying was so-called &quot;flight-to-quality&quot;purchases made by investors rushing to get cash out of theMiddle East and into the U.S., which is considered a safehaven. But the bulk of buyers last week were domestic tradersand arbitragers who are betting that the Fed will soon cutthe benchmark federal funds rate from its current level of8%, which in turn will boost the value of securitiespurchased when rates were higher and allow those investors tobook profits.   A cut in the federal funds rate, which banks charge eachother on overnight loans, could also nudge other short-termand intermediate-term rates lower. Commercial bankers couldreact to such a move by cutting the prime, or base, lendingrate for corporations as well as short-term consumer lendingrates like those on home-equity loans.   Speculation that the Fed will soon ease interest rates hasbeen swirling for weeks, but the prospects that such aneasing will occur sooner, rather than later, were heightenedon Friday when the government released a bombshell Julyemployment report.   The biggest surprise was that employment growth actuallydeclined, the first time that has happened since June 1986.The Department of Labor said the number of non-farm jobsdeclined 219,000 last month. Even when layoffs of temporarycensus workers were excluded, the decline was 57,000.   With so many workers handed pink sheets, the unemploymentrate jumped 0.3 percentage point to 5.5%.   &quot;The employment numbers confirmed that the economy isweak; I think the Fed will ease,&quot; said Samuel D. Kahan, chieffinancial economist at Fuji Securities Inc. He said that ifthe Fed decides to make its move, it will likely do so earlythis week -- before the Treasury's huge quarterly auction ofgovernment securities. Otherwise, he said, the Fed may waituntil late this month to ease rates, after its nextpolicymaking Federal Open Market Committee meeting.   Mr. Kahan and many other economists on Wall Street thinkthe Fed will probably ease despite oil-inspired inflationfears.   &quot;Central bankers always say that their job is to fightinflation, no matter what,&quot; Mr. Kahan said. &quot;But the truth ofthe matter is, this central bank will only fight inflationwhen it is sure that economic activity is growing. If itlooks like the economy is sliding toward recession, the fightagainst inflation will be postponed -- not aborted -- butpostponed.&quot;   But the long-term end of the bond market is worlds apartfrom the short end. In fact, long-term investors are worriedabout how events unfolding in the Persian Gulf will affectinflation.   Fears of spiraling prices came from two sources. One is abig spike in oil prices triggered by the Iraqi invasion ofKuwait, which raises the specter of less-plentiful andmore-expensive oil supplies. The other is the six-cent risein hourly earnings in the July employment report, a figurethat analysts say makes the threat of inflation even greater.   With the threat of inflation looming large, investors arecooling toward long-term Treasury bonds. They are notdumping, but simply aren't buying any new ones. And that'sdepressing prices.   Still, at a time when the stock market appears shaky, theeconomy is on the verge of recession and numerous financialuncertainties exist, some investors are sticking withlong-term Treasurys.   &quot;You can get 8.5% yield on 30-year Treasury bonds and thatlooks pretty good to us,&quot; said Ian MacKinnon, head offixed-income investments at Vanguard Group. &quot;If it turns outthat what Iraq has done is push inflation up, then I willhave to modify my outlook,&quot; he said.   All of this is a mixed blessing for the Treasury, which isscheduled to auction $32.25 billion of securities this weekin its quarterly refunding of the federal debt. The Treasurywill sell $11.5 billion of three-year notes tomorrow, $10.5billion of ten-year notes Wednesday and $10.25 billion of30-year bonds Thursday.   &quot;Considering the appetite for short-term securities, thefirst auction should be the smoothest,&quot; said Ms. Ramirez. Shesaid, however, that the ten-year and 30-year bonds mayencounter more investor resistance.   ---   Friday's Market Activity                                                                                                          Prices of long-term bonds continued to tumble in theaftermath of Iraq's conquest of Kuwait.   The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell nearly 1 1/4points, or $12.50 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount, onThursday as news of turmoil in the Middle East sparkedspeculation that oil supplies would become less plentiful andmore expensive, putting upward pressure in inflation.   The bond rout continued Friday with prices of thebenchmark 30-year bond plunging an additional 1 1/8 point.   Prices of short-term issues, however, rose as employmentdata hinting of a recession seemed to indicate the FederalReserve might have to ease policy quickly to keep theeconomic expansion alive.   In the corporate-bond market, the payment-in-kind bonds ofRJR Nabisco Inc. settled sharply lower after investment firmKohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. -- which controls RJR -- boughtback a hefty chunk of its exchangeable bonds Thursday.Payment-in-kind bonds pay interest in the form of additionalsecurities.   The bonds fell because investors assume that therepurchase of RJR Nabisco's pay-in-kind bonds is nearlycomplete.   Officials at RJR Nabisco declined to comment on thebuy-backs, but traders estimate that RJR in the past threeweeks has bought back $1.5 billion of its 17% bonds of 2007.Much of that buying was done last Thursday, traders said,when Iraq's invasion of Kuwait spooked many participants inthe financial markets. People familiar with the open-marketrepurchase program estimate that RJR did most of itspurchases at 90 cents to 94 cents on the dollar.   On Thursday alone, KKR, working through Goldman, Sachs andamp;Co., bought between $800 million and $1 billion of the RJRbonds, according to people familiar with the repurchase. Atleast some of those purchases were below the bonds' New YorkStock Exchange closing price of 91 3/4 cents on the dollar,traders said. KKR, Goldman and RJR all declined to discusstheir roles.   Market sources speculated that some of the bonds may havecome from the accounts of takeover-stock speculators as wellas from Nebraska investor Warren Buffet. Mr. Buffet declinedto comment.   RJR's 17% exchangeable payment-in-kind debentures ended 13/4 points lower to close at 90 on robust volume of nearly$20 million on the New York Stock Exchange. RJR's 17 3/8%convertible payment-in-kind debentures fell 2 1/8 points toclose at 111 1/2 on relatively heavy volume.   In the broader high-yield market, junk bonds, orspeculative-grade securities with low credit ratings or nocredit ratings at all, finished 1/2 to 3/4 point lower.   Hard hit were the junk bonds of casinos operated by realestate developer Donald Trump. Trump Plaza Funding Corp.'s 127/8% first-mortgage bonds ended down three points at 76,while the Trump Taj Mahal Funding Corp.'s 14% bonds closeddown 1 1/2 points at 44 in over-the-counter trading.   Some Trump bonds have been been falling due to news thatgaming revenues at the Trump casinos fell sharply duringJuly.</TEXT></DOC>
