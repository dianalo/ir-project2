Some analysts expect the defense contractor to take a special charge because of continuing technical problems in making electronic equipment for the MX missile. And some have lowered fourth-quarter earnings estimates because of other bungled electronics projects.    Paul Nisbet of Prudential-Bache Securities reduced his fourth-quarter estimate 25%, to 98 cents a share. David Smith of Alex. Brown andamp; Sons cut his estimate to 95 cents a share from $1.15.    &quot;Northrop's always had very strong margins in electronics, as high as 12% (pretax),&quot; says Mr. Nisbet. But he estimates those margins are down to about 8% because of &quot;nagging problems&quot; with contracts to make guidance systems for the air-launched cruise missile, electronics equipment for the F-15 fighter and other electronics projects the company doesn't discuss.    Los Angeles-based Northrop had net income of $9.3 million, or 20 cents a share, on revenue of $1.7 billion in the 1986 fourth quarter. That included $105.3 million in charges for Northrop's canceled F-20 jet fighter.    The MX write-down is a bit harder for analysts to predict. Northrop's problems with the nuclear-tipped missile's sophisticated guidance electronics already have hurt profit margins in the 1987 second and third quarters. The Air Force is withholding the $25 million monthly payments under MX contracts. Northrop's handling of the project has been under investigation by the Pentagon and the Justice Department.    But things got worse in the fourth quarter, as Northrop slipped further behind on deliveries, and some equipment in the field failed. The chairman of the House Armed Services Committee says the company had to repair 47 out of the 64 systems it delivered to the Pentagon.    Since the MX contracts are fixed-price -- meaning Northrop has to cover much of the overruns -- analysts believe the company has to recognize a lower profit rate over the life of the $1 billion program. &quot;We know there's going to be a hit,&quot; says Gary Reich of Shearson Lehman.    The tricky question is: when? Mr. Smith predicts the company will take a charge of between $10 million and $20 million against fourth-quarter earnings, which Northrop is scheduled to report Feb. 17. &quot;I think the MX is going to cost more than analysts have previously thought,&quot; says Mr. Smith.    A spokesman for the company declined to comment.    Jerry Cantwell of Wertheim andamp; Co. is taking no chances. His 98-cent-a-share estimate for the quarter is, he says, &quot;before any charges I am expecting.&quot; But because he isn't sure whether the charges will show up in the fourth quarter, he has lowered his 1988 earnings projection to $3 a share from the $4 he was expecting before the electronics problems showed up. &quot;Depending on what happens with the write-off, I could go as high as $3.25. They could do even better, but the past is not a good guide at Northrop.&quot;    Analysts generally have a hard time projecting earnings for Northrop because a big chunk of its sales come from classified military programs. Analysts don't know the official revenue stream or the profit margin, so they rely on a variety of unofficial sources. It's not surprising, therefore, that estimates for Northrop's 1987 revenue range from $5.1 billion to more than $6 billion. &quot;It's like playing Russian roulette,&quot; Mr. Smith says.    While others are lowering their earnings estimates, Wolfgang Demisch of First Boston Corp. has held firm for several months at a still lower number -- 73 cents a share for the fourth quarter, or $2 a share for the year. Northrop had 1986 net income of $41.2 million, or 89 cents a share, on revenue of $5.6 billion.    The company's stumble in electronics has come at the wrong time, analysts say. They have counted on electronics to make up for cost overruns on the Stealth bomber -- which resulted in $214 million pretax in unexpected write-downs in the first nine months of 1987. In addition, the company's aircraft group isn't doing as well as expected, largely because of spending an estimated $50 million to $60 million of 1987 profits to compete for the Air Force's advanced-tactical-fighter contract.    Mr. Smith believes the company is behind on deliveries of $150 million to $200 million of its electronic gear, which he says cut 1987 revenue in the electronics segment by as much as 15%, to about $1.1 billion. He adds, &quot;They're just not getting the product out the door.&quot;    ---   Northrop   (NYSE; Symbol: NOC)   Business: Aerospace and electronics   Year ended Dec. 31, 1986:   Revenue: $5.61 billion   Net income: $41.2 million; 89 cents a share -   Third quarter, Sept. 30, 1987:   Net income: $34.1 million, 73 cents a share vs. loss: $30.5 million   Average daily trading volume: 167,925 shares   Common shares outstanding: 46.8 million</TEXT></DOC>
