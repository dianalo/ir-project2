He predicted export sales this year of around $33 billion and afarm trade surplus of perhaps $12 billion.   Exports in March soared to 14.8 million tons valued at $3.3billion, compared with 11.4 million tons valued at $2.4 billion thesame month a year earlier. It was the best monthly performancesince December 1984.   The nation's agricultural trade surplus in March was $1.38billion, also the largest since December 1984. It was the fifthstraight month that the nation has posted a surplus of $1 billionor more.   USDA said fiscal 1988 agricultural exports through March totaled77.3 million tons valued at $17.8 billion. It said that representedan increase of 13.6 million tons and $3.3 billion from the sameperiod last year.   Soviet purchases have accounted for 68 percent of the volumeincrease this year.   Department economists are forecasting fiscal 1988 exportstotaling 145.5 million tons and valued at $33.5 billion. Thatrepresents an increase over initial estimates. The higher forecastsare due to additional sales of animal products, as well as wheat,feeds and fodders and soybeans.   Animal products are likely to set a record of $5.6 billion,attributable to surprisingly strong demand for hides, skins, redmeats and fats, the department said.   The department also said exports are likely to be 16 milliontons and $5.6 billion higher than fiscal 1987. It attributed thebulk of the increase to diminished supplies among competitornations and the Export Enhancement Program.   The EEC, established by Congress in 1985, pays exporters ingovernment surplus commodities to ship American grain overseas.   Estimated U.S. agricultural imports, meanwhile, were increasedfrom $20.5 billion to $21 billion. It said imports for Marchtotaled $1.95 billion, a gain of $35 million, or 2 percent, overthe comparable figure for March 1987. It also was $24 million, or 1percent, over the February level.   The volume of imports was virtually unchanged since last year,with fruit juices, nursery products and alcoholic beveragesactually posting declines, USDA said. It said, however, the lowerdollar raised the overall import bill.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng iscalling on European Community trade negotiators to come up withtheir own plan to phase out farm subsidies if they dislike theAmerican version.   ``We've been unable to get the European Community even to statewhat the outcome should be,'' Lyng said at a National Press Clubluncheon Wednesday.   He said the United States is not insisting on its plan to phaseout all agricultural subsidies by the year 2000 and is ``perfectlywilling to sit down and be involved in negotiations,'' but thatthus far European trade officials have indicated little interest insuch bargaining.   ``They won't come up with any sort of proposal,'' he said.   He expressed hope, however, that some progress could be made inMontreal in December at the midterm meeting of the Uruguay Round ofnegotiations aimed at updating the General Agreement on Tariffs andTrade.   ``We must make this work because the alternatives are so bad,''Lyng said. He said the current system of subsidies is harmful toEuropean and American farmers as well as the economies ofdeveloping nations. But he said the United States could not actunilaterally.   ``Our farmers are willing to compete with farmers anywhere butthey do not want to compete with the treasuries of foreigngovernments,'' he said.   Lyng also shrugged off European criticism that the United Stateshas increased wheat production when Europe has been reducing itsown wheat production.   ``I have been unable to detect any reductions in Europeanproduction,'' he said. He said the United States already has idledacreage equivalent to all of the farmland in France and Spaintogether while ``the reductions they are talking about arepipsqueak when they are compared to our reductions.''   The administration recently changed the acreage idlingrequirement for participants in the wheat program from 27{ percentto 10 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
