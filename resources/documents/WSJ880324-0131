For instance, many critics of the U.S.'s European allies contend that those countries don't spend as much to defend themselves as Washington does. To support that view, they point out that the U.S. spends about 6.5% of its gross domestic product on defense, while the large European nations spend only about 3.7%. But the study suggests the comparison isn't valid because the apparently large American burden includes billions of dollars spent on forces the U.S. maintains outside Europe, while European defense budgets mainly support forces deployed in that region.    The report -- one of the most comprehensive studies on the subject of relative defense spending -- comes as rhetoric on &quot;burden sharing&quot; heats up in the U.S. Because of budget pressures and resentment over European and Japanese gains in global trade, U.S. lawmakers are demanding higher allied defense expenditures, and they are threatening to pull some U.S. troops out of Europe and Japan if such budget increases don't materialize.    In fact, Pentagon officials say, the U.S. wouldn't save much money by pulling troops away from bases in Europe or Japan. Unless the Defense Department were to take divisions out of commission altogether, it still would have to pay for bases and housing elsewhere, as well as the costs of moving the personnel and equipment.    The report also noted that the burdensharing debate primarily involves how much the allies spend rather than what equipment they deploy in the field. The report found that the European allies and Canada supply 53% of the tanks, 46% of the artillery and 58% of the active duty military personnel the alliance has to defend Europe.    Mr. Adams said the U.S. equipment deployed in Europe is often more capable and costly. But he added that &quot;the allies may be getting more bang for the buck.&quot;    Beyond questions of spending or firepower, burden-sharing debates are complicated by less quantifiable, but politically significant, factors. For example, an East-West conflict would be fought chiefly on European, not American, soil. And in peacetime, European citizens have to put up more with the roar of exercising fighter planes and an occasional procession of tanks.    Although the allies often debate these relative burdens, they have never agreed on what would be a reasonable formula for measuring relative contributions to the defense effort. Many doubt they ever will arrive at a mutually acceptable approach.    According to the Defense Budget Project, there is little basis for perceptions that the U.S.'s European allies have significantly expanded their capacity to spend on defense. The U.S. share of the alliance members' combined gross domestic product dropped to 53.6% in 1986 from 55.4% in 1960, while slight increases were spread among the allies. Of course, the European economies had already expanded tremendously from 1949 through 1960.    Mr. Adams concluded that the current focus on allied burden-sharing is a &quot;distraction&quot; from the more important task of planning a military force for the remainder of the century. &quot;Throwing sand in our allies' faces is undeserved,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
