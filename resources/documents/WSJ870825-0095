As terrible as this incident was, it would have been worse had it been a government, not unscrupulous &quot;coyotes,&quot; that had loaded these people into the airtight boxcar. It would have been worse if the victims had not been pursuing a dream of opportunity, but instead had been forced by a neighboring government to return to a country from which they had fled, a country with a record of brutal repression.    It happened.    Last Dec. 20, 125 Ethiopian &quot;illegal aliens&quot; in Djibouti were rounded up by the government, herded into a closed, metal freight car and returned to Ethiopia. When the doors opened, five were found dead, having suffocated en route. Although Djibouti is directly accountable, little has been done to hold it responsible.    Ethiopians flee their country for a variety of reasons -- some to escape Ethiopia's poor economy, but many to escape political and religious persecution. A recent U.S. State Department report terms Ethiopia's human-rights record &quot;deplorable,&quot; and goes on to say: &quot;Leaving Ethiopia without authorization is a serious offense punishable by five to 25 years' imprisonment or, in exceptional cases, reportedly by death.&quot;    Last year Ethiopia announced an amnesty that was greeted by most Ethiopian exiles with acute suspicion. Those suspicions were not shared, however, by the government of Djibouti, which quickly responded with an announcement of a &quot;voluntary repatriation&quot; program for Ethiopian refugees on its soil. The Djibouti government views the presence of 17,000 Ethiopian refugees and an undetermined number of undocumented Ethiopians as straining the nation's shaky economy, upsetting its delicate ethnic balance and threatening friendly relations with its more powerful neighbor, Ethiopia.    The voluntary repatriation program is monitored by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and has resulted in the return of some 3,000 Ethiopians, mostly rural people who fled warfare in the Hararghe region nearly a decade ago. As the voluntary program is being carried out, however, Djibouti authorities have also been conducting sweeps of the capital in an effort to forceably repatriate undocumented Ethiopians, many of whom apparently left their country on political grounds.    While the refugees who reside in refugee camps are assisted by the UNHCR, individual asylum seekers in the towns have much greater difficulty being recognized as refugees. Following the announcement of the voluntary repatriation program, the Djibouti government refused to register newcomers and even suspended its procedure for determining refugee eligibility. Had any of the 125 Ethiopians on the train last December tried to register as refugees, it is doubtful that they would have got very far. The UNHCR's determination that &quot;there were no refugees on the train&quot; is, therefore, unconvincing.    Hoping to escape forced repatriation, some undocumented Ethiopians have gone to the Dikhil refugee camp on the urging of the UNCHR, which promised assistance and protection. But once at Dikhil, they were brought before an eligibility committee to determine whether they were bona fide refugees. That they presented themselves to a refugee camp was not deemed sufficient to establish their status -- as it was with the earlier arrivals.    According to refugees and private-agency accounts, as of the end of May fewer than 10% of the approximately 270 Ethiopians who had gone to Dikhil received asylum. The rest were advised to return to Ethiopia or to appeal their rejection to the Djiboutian government within 72 hours. According to refugee and private-agency accounts, more than 100 went on a hunger strike and on June 1, a contingent of Djiboutian security forces using tear gas forced 103 hunger strikers into trucks, burned down their tents and possessions, and sent them back to Ethiopia.    Details of the June 1 incident are disputed. U.S. government and international agency officials say that the Dikhil residents rioted, went on a &quot;rampage&quot; and burned their own tents, in addition to burning the U.N. and Djibouti flags. Their reports do not include mention of a hunger strike. But there appears to be agreement on the fact that seven of the protesters who were returned to Ethiopia were officially &quot;of concern&quot; to the UNHCR. After their return, the seven were arrested and imprisoned by the Ethiopians. Diplomatic intervention apparently resulted in their release, and they appear to have crossed again into Djibouti.    Today, many Ethiopians remain in hiding in Djibouti. The Djibouti government, knowing that past abuses have caused barely a murmur, continues the roundups and forced repatriation of undocumented Ethiopians.    As horrible as the deaths suffered by those in the Mexican boxcar were, perhaps they were not without meaning, if only because they drew attention to the plight of others in similar circumstances. But so far, the deaths suffered on the train to Ethiopia haven't had that effect. The plight of the refugees in Djibouti has yet to penetrate the world's consciousness. Until it does so, the lives of Ethiopians remaining in Djibouti continue to be at risk.    ---   Mr. Frelick is a policy analyst at the U.S. Committee for Refugees, a private refugee-protection agency in Washington. </TEXT></DOC>
