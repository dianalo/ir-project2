Zhang Lin, who took part in hunger strikes on the square, isthankful to her university for political education classes givingstudents a chance to ``reach a clear understanding'' of the Junetragedy.   The two were among a group of 13 officials and students fromQinghua University who met foreign reporters today to give theirviews of the student-led democracy movement and its aftermath.   Their conclusions _ that with thorough ideological guidance thestudents now realized their errors in joining the 7-week-longpro-democracy protests _ matched daily reports in the official pressin which students admit being misled by ``counterrevolutionaries''bent on overthrowing the government.   The newly adopted pro-government stances, however, differ withwhat many students say in private conversations. They say studentsrepeat whatever is expected of them at political discussion sessionsbut that few people really accept the government version of thecrackdown on the student movement.   Qinghua Vice President Liang Yoneng said as many as 2,000 of theuniversity's 13,800 undergraduate and graduate students joined majorstreet marches in late April and that 200 took part in a mid-Mayhunger strike.   Four students were killed, all by gunshots, and 11 were injuredduring the June 3-4 military attack on students and their supporters.   Chinese officials say 500 people died in the crackdown, whileWestern security sources say the death toll may have been in thethousands.   Liang said no students had been expelled for participating in thedemonstrations. Three students wanted by police had been arrested,and police were conducting ``further investigations'' against othersinvolved in spreading rumors and instigating unrest, he said.   Liang's only expression of regret was that the university did notmove more quickly to stop the demonstrations. ``If we had stoppedthem the losses would have been smaller.''   Shu, an automotive engineering student, said it was ``quitereasonable'' for the government to round up student leaders because``they violated the law in some respects and they must be dealtwith.''   Student activists who led the protests have been charged withcounterrevolutionary crimes and have been among the thousandsarrested since the June crackdown.   The students at Qinghua, one of China's most respecteduniversities, returned to campus on Aug. 14 to catch up on classesmissed during the turmoil and for a heavy dose of politicalindoctrination.   Similar to other Beijing universities, Qinghua students arereceiving four weeks of political education, eight hours a week ofreading documents by government leaders, watching government-editedvideos that show rioters attacking soldiers and writing personalreflections expected to reveal sadder but wiser individuals.   The foreign reporters were also given a tour of a computerclassroom and a student workshop and allowed to speak briefly withstudents.   One, 20-year-old engineering student Shi Xiaoli, said studentsnow agree they were pulled into a counterrevolutionary rebellion.   But unlike the selected speakers, Miss Shi acknowledged there wassome unhappiness with specific government measures. She mentioned aharshly worded editorial in the Communist Party's People's Daily onApril 26 which accused the students of causing social turmoil.   ``It was like setting fire to dry wood,'' she said, referring toa major protest march on April 27. ``The editorial should have madeclearer that only a handful were counterrevolutionaries.''</TEXT></DOC>
