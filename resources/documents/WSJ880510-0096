Travelers must pass through West Bank towns such as Jericho, their shops shuttered by commercial strikes and their streets crackling with tension between Israeli soldiers and angry-eyed residents.    On the Jordanian side, life bustles along at a normal pace against a backdrop of fertile farms and villas built with workers' remittances in the years of the Persian Gulf oil boom.    King Hussein, Jordan's monarch, has made it clear that the Palestinian uprising against the Israeli occupation, now in its sixth month, won't be allowed to spill into his kingdom, despite its 65% Palestinian majority.    In the early days of the uprising the Jordanian security apparatus moved quickly to round up a couple of dozen radicals and to call in many more for warnings. Protest against Israeli actions have been so strictly limited that some West Bankers complain they get more support from demonstrators in Tel Aviv than they do from their kinfolk in Amman.    Jordanian sensitivities were exposed in the expulsion this month of Rick Davis, NBC's bureau chief, after he reported that Jordan was suppressing its Palestinian citizens. Two Palestinian journalists had their press credentials revoked.    At the same time, the king has used the Moslem month of Ramadan, with its tradition of nightly fast-breaking feasts, to make a series of speeches stressing his support for the uprising but at the same time placing the burden of any new peace negotiations squarely with the Palestine Liberation Organization. At a meeting with Western reporters Saturday night, the king, soft-spoken but deliberate, said once again that Jordan would go to an international conference either on its own, as part of a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation, or as part of an Arab delegation. &quot;But I'm not prepared to negotiate, nor will I negotiate&quot; for the Palestinians, he said.    The uprising sent a clear message to the king. Despite a long and delicate campaign to win the loyalty of West Bank Palestinians, who were under Jordanian rule between 1948 and 1967, the voice of the uprising has been, overwhelmingly, the voice of the PLO. King Hussein, quick to hear it, has stressed repeatedly that under no circumstances would he speak for the PLO in negotiations with Israel.    &quot;The king is trying to say, 'OK, you want the PLO, you've got the PLO -- now see if you can do anything without me,'&quot; says a senior Jordanian analyst.    While the PLO has long demanded its own voice, many prominent Palestinians are concerned that the king's statements and his crackdown on dissent make it seem as if he is pulling away from Palestinians at a critical time. One risk, as they see it, is that opportunities arising from the uprising might be lost. Even Shimon Peres, the Israeli Labor Party leader who supports the king's call for an international peace conference, has ruled out inviting the PLO.    Another risk is that Syria might move into any opening left by Jordan, thus replacing the king's moderation with Hafez al-Assad's radicalism.    The king may see bigger risks elsewhere. Jordan's longtime role at the center of the peace process &quot;has been nothing but a Via Doloroso for us,&quot; says a senior government official, with Jordan often accused of trying to push Palestinians aside or somehow betray their interests.    Now, the official argues, Palestinians should carry their own cross to the negotiating table rather than have someone else to blame for any concessions that may have to be made.    While Jordan has treated Palestinian refugees better than any other Arab state has, extending them full citizenship, it has also been ruthless in asserting its sovereignty, crushing the PLO in 1970 when Yasser Arafat's guerrillas threatened the government's control. Since then the relationship between King Hussein and Mr. Arafat has seesawed, with some of the king's attempts to advance the peace process stymied by Mr. Arafat's changes of position. As well, the king has had an irresolute U.S. administration and a bitterly divided Israel to sour his taste for continuing peace efforts.    At the meeting with Western journalists, the king bitterly criticized the U.S. memorandum of agreement signed last month with Israel following Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's rejection of Secretary of State George Shultz's peace plan. He said the memorandum, pledging five years of cooperation, was &quot;disturbing, shocking and disappointing&quot; and tended to confirm the view that the U.S. supports Israel whatever it does.    Indeed, the extremists behind Prime Minister Shamir offer another reason for Jordan to wish to differentiate itself from the Palestinians. As Israeli opinion moves to the right, the notion of mass deportation of Palestinians is slowly gaining respectability. Jordan, with a flagging economy and a 4.2% annual birth-rate, couldn't absorb another influx of refugees no matter how sympathetically it viewed their plight. </TEXT></DOC>
