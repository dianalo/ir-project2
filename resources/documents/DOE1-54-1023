To further investigate this question, two channels whichlead to the /sup 23/Na compound nucleus, /sup 10/B+/sup 13/C and {sup7}Li+/sup 16/O, have been studied. When combined with the results froman earlier /sup 11/B+/sup 12/C investigation, an extensive set of datais now available to study the entrance channel dependence of heavy-ionresonance formation in /sup 23/Na.</TEXT></DOC>
