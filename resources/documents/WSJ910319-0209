Some are patriotic standards from theZionist-Socialist movement of the 1940s. These same tuneswere popular, through international socialist channels, inthe Soviet Union at the height of the Stalinist era. Thus,the emigres, finally shaking off the shackles of communism,are confronted at their first moment of freedom by a chorusof &quot;Stalinist&quot; anthems.   But that's how it goes for the Soviets streaming intoIsrael. Welcomed to a new land, they still must clamber overthe obstacles left by Israel's socialist roots.</LP><TEXT>   In 1990, Israel spent $1.39 billion to absorb 185,000immigrants. If that money were simply handed out on aper-capita basis, an immigrant family of four would have anincome twice the national average. But only a small fractionis given in cash; the rest goes for the absorptionbureaucracy -- which is spread over an intricate tangle ofgovernment programs.   The immigrants' path to prosperity is a complex obstaclecourse: The Israelis promote socialist programs that threatento drive the immigrants back into Soviet-style poverty. Theimmigrants try to navigate through the programs so they canlead normal lives. Here's how the game works when theimmigrants try to find housing:                                                                                                          -- Phase 1: The costs wall. Even before the immigrantsbegin looking for a residence, the government has been busypushing costs way beyond what any immigrant can afford. Onelocal study found that two-thirds of the price of a home canbe traced to government regulation.   The government owns 93% of the land and releases it ontothe market in such dribs and drabs that its price isartificially inflated. It also sanctions local cement andsteel monopolies, which means these products cost severaltimes the world market price. Government departments, incooperation with Histadrut -- the powerful labor federation-- work hard to keep foreign builders out, thus reducingcompetition.                                                                                                          -- Phase 2: The rental loop-the-loop. Since home-buyingcosts are so exorbitant, immigrants could try to rent. Butthe government has pre-empted that maneuver.   Rent control and tenant-rights legislation are such thatit's the tenant who effectively owns the apartment, not thelandlord. Only the brave or the foolhardy rent outapartments. Some landlords won't rent to tenants who do notagree to move out on a certain date. Tenants must put up alarge deposit, to be forfeited if they do not move out ontime.                                                                                                          -- Phase 3: The debt trap. The government offersimmigrants loans of $37,000 toward a home purchase. This hitsthe immigrants on three levels. First, it gets them intodebt. Many immigrants don't understand what they are signingup for. &quot;When they sign the mortgage, they think they owntheir house,&quot; says Ari Volvovski, a Russian immigrant whohelps the new arrivals.   Second, the government is encouraging them to make a riskyinvestment on margin. The Soviets (and many governmentofficials) tend not to realize that buying a house entailsinvestment risk. Given the way government construction isdelayed, a flood of housing could come on the market just asimmigration-fed demand tapers off. That could create asituation where Soviets owe large amounts on homes that areworth less than what they paid for them.   Third, the government brags that the loans are interestfree. But the payments are indexed to inflation. Many will beshocked to discover their payments rising 17% a year.                                                                                                          -- Phase 4: The sting. Normally, the $37,000 loan wouldcover much of the cost of a modest home. But governmentpolicies artificially inflate housing costs. Average homes incentral Israel cost between $100,000 and $150,000. Sovietsgenerally choose the cheapest homes, at about $60,000, andscrape together other debt to cover the difference betweenthe government loan and the cost of the house. Rest assuredthat they have more incentive to pay off this debt than thegovernment loan.   To get the government loan, the immigrants have to findthree guarantors to cosign. When you are sitting in a roomfulof home-owning emigres and you ask them who are theirguarantors, they all point to each other.   In other words, the loans create a giant house of cards. Afew defaults bring down the whole group. It's easy to seewhat would happen if thousands of immigrants were suddenlyfaced with defaults on their loans. The government would bailout the whole mess, and the Soviets would get to keep theirhomes.   There are other obstacles. The high minimum-wage laws andbenefit mandates reduce the number of low-end jobs. Thegovernment permit process is so exhausting that only thoseIsraelis with extensive personal connections can expeditethem. And then there's government protection of industry:Israeli West Bankers speak about a Palestinian man who wantedto start a concrete company to compete with the monopoly. Thecivil administration refused to let him proceed -- notbecause he was Palestinian, but because he threatened acoddled industry.   There is some movement toward economic liberalization, ledby think tanks such as The Israeli Center for Social andEconomic Progress. Thanks to those efforts, you can't throw astone in the Israeli Parliament without hitting fourpoliticians professing their faith in the free market. Butthis is a faith rarely sullied by deeds -- the entrenchedinterests are too strong.   Former Prime Minister Shimon Peres says: &quot;I'm for themarket, but the market does not absorb immigrants. The marketis indifferent. Absorption has to be done by the people. Whenyou fight a war, the market doesn't fight, the people do.&quot;   The people will end up doing OK. The immigrants will findways to subvert the maze of socialist regulation andintegrate into the economy after a few years. Israel, despiteitself, will be immeasurably stronger.   ---   Mr. Brooks is deputy editorial page editor of The WallStreet Journal Europe.</TEXT></DOC>
