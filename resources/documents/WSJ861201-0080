The defendants contend that when they discussed providing Iran with arms, they believed U.S. government approval of their shipments would be forthcoming.    At about the time the alleged conspiracy to violate the arms embargo took place, the president was quietly sanctioning at least $12 million of arms shipments to Iran.    The trial of the arms-smuggling case here, originally scheduled for last month, has been postponed until February.    In an article in The Wall Street Journal this fall describing &quot;sting&quot; operations conducted by U.S. Customs Service investigators to block the flow of illegal arms shipments to Iran, Leonard Walton, director of the Customs Service's strategic investigations division, was quoted as saying, &quot;Nobody today is more active than the Iranians in attempting to procure U.S. weapons.&quot;    A government source said Customs Service officials were unaware at the time that President Reagan had sanctioned weapons for Iran.    Some 44 illegal arms cases -- not all involving Iran -- have been brought for prosecution since the Customs Service's Operation Exodus began in 1981. Six cases, including the big case in New York, were pending as of last June. When the conspiracy charges were announced last April, Customs Service commissioner William von Raab hailed the case as &quot;another victory against international terrorism.&quot;    Jonathan Marks, attorney for defendant Guri Eisenberg, said the Reagan administration's recent disclosure of arms shipments to Iran is of &quot;immeasurable benefit&quot; to the defendants.    &quot;When the defendants (originally) said that they believed the arms deal would be authorized by the U.S. government, the government's response was this was wishful thinking, fanciful and fabricated,&quot; Mr. Marks said. &quot;But (the government's announcement of arms sales) shows that the defendants' belief was consistent with the facts,&quot; Mr. Marks contended.    Mr. Marks said he is attempting to obtain testimony from Vice President George Bush, former National Security Adviser John Poindexter and ex-National Security Council aide Lt. Col. Oliver North to see what they know about U.S. arms shipments to Iran.    According to Mr. Marks, Guri Eisenberg and his father Israel Eisenberg, another defendant, are Israeli businessmen who contracted with &quot;certified agents&quot; of the Israeli Ministry of Defense to purchase arms for Iran. Israeli officials have conceded that Israel acted as a middleman in supplying Iran with U.S.-made arms.    Rudolph Giuliani, U.S. attorney in New York, whose office is handling the case, couldn't be reached for comment. The 18 defendants are accused of illegally attempting to sell more than $2 billion of American weapons to Iran, including antitank missiles, fighter planes and helicopters, through falsified export certificates. The weapons were never shipped. The U.S. State Department requires arms exporters to certify that the arms aren't going to embargoed nations like Iran.    In a telephone interview, another defendant, Nico Minardos, said the planned sale was the brainchild of the late Cyrus Hashemi, an Iranian. &quot;It was supposed to have been sanctioned by Vice President Bush (and others),&quot; Mr. Minardos said. &quot;We were supposed to see their signatures. We never saw them. Therefore, we didn't proceed. At the time, we were told the vice president is delaying it, that he will sign it.&quot;    Mr. Hashemi, who died in July, was indicted by a New York federal grand jury in 1984 for conspiracy to ship military gear to Iran in 1980 and 1981.    He later became a government informant, according to attorneys for defendants in the current New York case. The attorneys charge that Customs Service agents were aided by Mr. Hashemi, who, according to government documents filed in federal court in New York in connection with the pending case, portrayed himself to the alleged conspirators as Iran's purchasing agent.    The U.S. attorney's office has said that Mr. Hashemi, who wasn't charged with any wrongdoing in the pending case, was a cooperating witness.    Mr. Minardos said he informed Maxwell Rabb, U.S. ambassador to Italy, of the proposed arms deal last February. &quot;I told him about it, and he yelled not to speak over the phone, that he wanted to see me in Rome the next day,&quot; Mr. Minardos said. &quot;I met him the next day. I told him the story from A to Z.&quot;    Mr. Minardos contends he called Mr. Rabb after he became friendly with him at a July 1985 party in Spain that was given by Saudi Arabian arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi.    An American Embassy official in Rome acknowledged that Mr. Minardos met with Mr. Rabb in Rome after phoning the ambassador's secretary. Mr. Minardos talked about U.S. policy toward Iran and Libya -- not about any arms deal, according to the embassy official.    The official added that Mr. Rabb was one of 500 guests at the party in Spain and hasn't any recollection of having met Mr. Minardos there. Vice President Bush couldn't be reached for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
