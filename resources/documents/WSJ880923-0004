The study of 250 of the nation's largest profit-making corporations found that only 16 escaped taxation last year, compared with 40 in 1986 and 39 in 1985. Moreover, the report found the average effective tax rate paid by all 250 companies was 22.1% last year, up from 14.9% a year earlier.    But the two biggest corporate supporters of tax overhaul -- General Motors Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. -- were on the top of the group's new &quot;corporate freeloaders&quot; list. Both companies apparently reaped enormous benefits from the 1986 act. General Motors received a net refund of $742.2 million in taxes paid in previous years, giving it an effective tax rate of minus 31% for 1987, according to the Citizens for Tax Justice. And IBM received a net refund of $123.5 million, giving it an effective tax rate of minus 4.2%.    Many companies, however, disputed the study, saying some of its figures were erroneous.    &quot;Tax reform is working,&quot; concluded Robert McIntyre, the group's director. &quot;It isn't working perfectly. There are hitches . . . but tax reform represents a giant step in the direction of fairness.&quot;    The study, which is Citizens for Tax Justice's fourth annual report on corporate taxes, used publicly available information to calculate each company's domestic profits and its federal income tax payments actually made in a given year. Refunds of previous taxes are counted in the calculations; deferred taxes aren't.    The report on GM and IBM is clearly an embarrassment to the congressional authors of the Tax Reform Act, who worked closely with the two companies throughout the 1985-86 tax debate. At a news conference yesterday, Sens. Bob Packwood (R., Ore.) and Bill Bradley (D., N.J.) said they had received calls from GM indicating the company would pay taxes this year. Sen. Bradley said the two companies' zero-tax status would be a problem if it continued for &quot;three or four years.&quot;    Major defense contractors were clearly hit hard by the 1986 bill, which curtailed the so-called completed-contract accounting method they had used in previous years. Boeing Co. paid $543 million in taxes last year, or 83% of its domestic profit, according to the study. That compared with an effective rate of minus 8% from 1981 to 1985. General Dynamics Corp. paid $457 million in taxes, or 79% of its profit, compared with a minus 2% effective rate from 1981 to 1985. And Grumman Corp. paid $42 million in taxes, or 102% of its domestic profit, compared with 12% in 198185.    The Citizens for Tax Justice study received widespread publicity when it was first released in 1984 and helped provide public support for the tax overhaul effort. Largely in response to that study, Congress included a provision in the 1986 act that was designed to ensure that no company reporting profit to its shareholders could escape tax altogether.    The list of 16 profitable companies that still didn't pay any taxes last year suggests that the new minimum-tax provision isn't yet working as advertised. But Mr. McIntyre said most of the zero-tax companies had used carry-backs of tax breaks to get refunds of taxes paid in previous years. Over time, he said, those carry-backs will disappear, and the list of zero-tax companies will become even smaller. Sen. Packwood said he expected the list eventually to disappear altogether.    A number of companies protested the calculations made by Mr. McIntyre. A statement from Aetna Life andamp; Casualty Co., for instance, said the insurance concern had actually paid $17 million in federal income taxes last year; the study showed the company receiving a tax refund of $32.4 million. But the Aetna statement acknowledged that the payment was &quot;unusually low,&quot; and said it expected &quot;to report substantially higher levels of taxable income in the future.&quot;    GM said the Citizens report was wrong, and that the overall effect of the 1986 tax act will increase the company's tax bill in future years. &quot;Contrary to reports, GM paid $73 million in federal income taxes for 1987,&quot; the company said in a prepared statement. But it allowed that it did have a lower tax burden in 1987, which it attributed to several factors, including lower profit from its U.S. operating divisions and a high amount of investment tax credits.    A spokeswoman for IBM said the refund figure &quot;is all wrong.&quot; She said, &quot;The fact is that we paid in taxes substantially more than the $10 million provision for 1987 listed in our annual report. In fact, we paid more federal taxes last year than we would have if the pretax reform laws had been applicable. That's primarily due to the alternative minimum tax (provision),&quot; she added.    &quot;The assertion that we did not pay federal income taxes in 1987 is incorrect,&quot; Consumers Power Co. spokesman Daniel Bishop said. &quot;In fact, we did pay approximately $8 million in 1987, and about the same is expected in 1988.&quot;    In Houston, a spokesman for Pennzoil Co. said his company isn't losing sleep over being listed by Citizens as a freeloader. He added that &quot;they don't consider deductions that are taken to arrive at those taxes.&quot;    Gulf States Utilities Co., a Beaumont, Texas, utility with cash flow problems, said it has received no tax refund. The utility speculated that Citizens miscalculated a refund because of the many complexities of accounting and taxing by utilities with expensive nuclear plants.    Carolina Power andamp; Light Co. didn't get a $27.6 million tax refund but rather paid $48.9 million, according to tax manager Murray F. Gould, who said the company's 1987 return was filed last week. He said Citizens apparently got its figures from a part of the company's annual report in which tax obligations are broken out by various business segments but which doesn't give the total picture. A spokesman for the Raleigh, N.C., utility said, &quot;We would strongly disagree with the allegation&quot; that the company is a corporate freeloader.    In Ashland, Ky., a spokesman for Ashland Oil Inc. asserted that the oil refiner's profit last year was $133.4 million, not the $158.5 million claimed by the study. The spokesman also said that the company didn't have a tax liability because its core refining business didn't have taxable income last year. He noted that Ashland recorded deferred tax liability of $77.4 million in 1987, which it expects to pay in the future. Ashland also expects to pay &quot;significant&quot; taxes in 1988, the spokesman added.    &quot;To call us freeloaders is simply inaccurate,&quot; said a spokesman for Corning Glass Works, Corning, N.Y. &quot;We did pay our proper share of taxes in 1987,&quot; he said, but noted that during the year the company reached a favorable settlement with the Internal Revenue Service over an issue that extended back several years. As a result, Corning received a credit that exceeded the amount it paid in taxes last year.    In Akron, Ohio, a spokesman for Goodyear Tire andamp; Rubber Co. called the information on the tire maker &quot;erroneous.&quot; He said Goodyear paid more than $75 million of federal income taxes last year and didn't receive a refund. He claimed the study's preparers &quot;failed to read all the footnotes in the annual report.&quot;    A spokeswoman for Sequa Corp. in New York said that the company had portfolio losses after the Oct. 19 market crash and is expecting refunds related to those losses. But she declined to confirm the Citizens estimate of $5.9 million, saying that tax officials weren't available. She added, however, that the company has applied for a refund.    In Chicago, Ivan Shandor, vice president for taxes at Baxter International Inc., said, &quot;I don't think we took advantage of anything. What we've done is complied with the tax laws.&quot; Mr. Shandor said the 1987 refund resulted from the fact that Baxter reported a loss in 1987 for tax purposes. He added that the Citizens apparently failed to note that Baxter also made a provision for $58 million in deferred federal taxes.    Overall, the study of 250 companies shows much less variation in corporate tax rates than in previous years. Most of the companies that had faced very low effective tax rates in the past saw their tax rates rise, while many facing high rates in the past saw their rates fall. As a result, the report concludes, &quot;tax reform has created a more level playing field for all businesses.&quot;    ---         Firms That Group Says Paid No Taxes in 1987                 (Dollar amounts in millions)                            PROFITS       REFUND      RATE    General Motors         $2,396.2      ($742.2)    -31.0%    IBM                     2,932.7       (123.5)    - 4.2    Aetna                   1,010.5        (32.4)    - 3.2    Baxter Travenol*          233.0        (32.0)    -13.7    Carolina Pandamp;L              536.3        (27.6)    - 5.2    Illinois Power            344.5        (25.6)    - 7.4    Corning                   122.6        (16.3)    -13.3    Hewlett-Packard           405.0        (15.0)    - 3.7    Ashland Oil               158.5        (11.8)    - 7.5    Greyhound                  62.9         (7.1)    -11.3    Ogden                      55.7         (6.7)    -12.1    Sequa Corp.                42.3         (5.9)    -13.9    Pennzoil                   76.8         (4.5)    - 5.9    Goodyear Tire             573.7         (2.4)    - 0.4    Consumers Power           384.3         (0.6)    - 0.2    Gulf States Utils         273.2          ...       ...
