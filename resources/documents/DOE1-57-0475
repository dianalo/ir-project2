This vulnerability is due to a transitiveintegrity corrupting mechanism called a computer virus which causes corruptedinformation to spread from program to program. Experiments have shownthat a virus can spread at an alarmingly rapid rate from user to user,from system to system, and from network to network, even when the best-availabilitysecurity techniques are properly used. Formal definitions of self-replication,evolution, viruses, and protection mechanisms are used to prove thatany system that allows sharing, general functionality, and transitivityof information flow cannot completely prevent viral attack. Computationalaspects of viruses are examined, and several undecidable problems areshown. It is demonstrated that a virus may evolve so as to generate anycomputable sequence. Protection mechanisms are explored, and the designof computer networks that prevent both illicit modification and disseminationof information are given. Administration and protection of informationnetworks based on partial orderings are examined, and probably correctautomated administrative assistance is introduced.</TEXT></DOC>
