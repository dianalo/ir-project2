The lower-profile policy, which includes a promise not to conclude any fresh defense contracts and to reduce cultural and tourism links, was decided Wednesday night by the inner cabinet of 10 senior Israeli ministers and confirmed yesterday in the Knesset, Israel's parliament, by Foreign Minister Shimon Peres. The policy switch appears motivated more by a desire to placate Washington than a belief that it will help end white domination in South Africa.    &quot;We shall gradually reduce our relationship with South Africa following policies that other democratic countries pursue,&quot; Mr. Peres said in speech. He stressed that while Israel unreservedly condemned racism in South Africa, it could &quot;not lead and we are not going to lead a world policy toward South Africa. At the same time we are not going to remain outside of a world policy as it is formulated by {democratic} countries.&quot;    Israeli leaders apparently recognize that their previous statements denouncing apartheid on moral grounds no longer suffice and that the receipt of valuable military aid from the U.S. could be in jeopardy because of a State Department report, due April 1, that is expected to name Israel as a major exporter of weapons to South Africa. That would put Israel on the spot; under terms of the congressional Anti-Apartheid Act of October 1986, countries that sell weapons to South Africa stand to forfeit U.S. aid.    Israel, the largest recipient of U.S. aid, receives $1.8 billion in military assistance out of an overall annual military aid package of $3 billion. &quot;We have taken U.S. opinion into account,&quot; Mr. Peres told the Knesset.    &quot;We simply cannot afford the risk of another wrangle with Washington at this time,&quot; one official said in an indirect reference to the strained relations over the Iran-arms scandal, in which Israel played a part, and the recent sentencing of U.S. Navy intelligence analyst Jonathan Jay Pollard as an Israeli spy.    Officials in Pretoria hadn't any official comment on the Israeli move, but politicians and commentators said it was understandable, given U.S. pressure on Jerusalem. &quot;Israel, like South Africa has been among the pariah nations . . . and whatever military link was forged between the countries was because of this,&quot; the pro-government Citizen newspaper commented in an editorial. &quot;It is vitally important for both South Africa and Israel that they are not estranged from each other because of U.S. blackmail.&quot; Because South Africa produces 90% of its own weapons, Pretoria officials seemed more concerned about a cutoff of nonmilitary Israeli goods than arms, analysts said.    Before Wednesday night's decision, Foreign Minister Peres had been pushing for Israel to fall into line with Western European states, but both other men in the governing triumvirate -- Prime Minister Yitshak Shamir and Defense Minister Yitshak Rabin -- had argued firmly against a major shift.    Mr. Shamir argued that while Israel condemned apartheid vigorously on moral grounds, it couldn't afford to neglect the interests of South Africa's 115,000 Jews, always close friends of Israel. (The Citizen, in its editorial, noted that South Africa was one of the first countries to recognize Israel and that the South African Jewish community had been allowed to maintain financial ties with Israel despite South Africa's stringent control over foreign investments.)    Mr. Rabin had been swayed by the arguments of a powerful defense-industry lobby, which maintained that thousands of jobs could be lost if defense contracts were summarily curtailed. Needing to make its home-based arms industry economically viable, Israel has long adopted the approach of selling arms to any government that wanted them. Consequently, arms exports amount to more than $1 billion annually.    But Mr. Rabin and Mr. Shamir lined up with Mr. Peres in Wednesday night's decision, with only Ariel Sharon, the former defense minister and currently industry and trade minister, arguing against sanctions. &quot;American attitudes, especially given the mood in wake of the Pollard sentencing, weighed heavily with both Shamir and Rabin&quot; one cabinet source observed.    The new policy isn't clearly delineated. It stipulates that no new defense contract will be signed. But Mr. Peres refused to respond to reporters' questions on how long existing arms-export contracts with South Africa will run.    Military censorship precludes mention of the precise amounts involved in such defense contracts or what they involve. But foreign estimates say that existing arms contracts with South Africa are worth between $200 million and $500 million annually and involve the transfer of technology more than weapons. In the Knesset, Mr. Peres rejected as &quot;baseless slanders&quot; a claim by a Communist member about alleged Israel-South African cooperation in the production of nuclear weapons.    The government also wouldn't elaborate on any other sanctions that will be instituted. But officials say they probably will involve limiting trading, cultural and scientific ties.    An important element of the trade relationship is coal. Israel imports $112 million worth of South African coal annually for its electricity-generating plants. But Mr. Peres said coal from China could be subsitituted for the South African coal. </TEXT></DOC>
