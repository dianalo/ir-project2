Background </ITAG>During the first 15 years of the Medicare program, Medicare was primarypayer for all services to Medicare beneficiaries, with the sole exceptionof services covered under workers' compensation. It was not until 1980that Congress began to amend section 1862 of the Act to make Medicare secondary,first to no-fault and liability insurance, and later to employer grouphealth plans that cover end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients and thatcover employed aged and aged spouses of employed individuals. Despite regulationsand instructions, implementation has fallen short of expectations. It ishospitals that are most directly affected by these changes because it isprimarily hospital services that are covered by private insurance. Experience has been that many ``Medicare secondary payer'' (MSP) claimsare not identified for MSP processing and that hospitals do not have proceduresto identify other insurance that the beneficiary may have. This situationhas been documented by_ andbullet; A Bureau of Quality Control study (summer of 1984), which foundthat up to 90 percent of all working aged claims were billed to Medicarerather than the other insurer because the hospital did not ask the beneficiaryfor information on other insurance or did not follow through on that information.andbullet; Bureau of Program Operations (BPO) on-site review of hospitals,which revealed that hospitals did not have procedures to use at the timeof admission to identify other insurers. andbullet; BPO investigation of hospital software vendors, which revealedthat the standard software packages for hospital admission routines donot include sufficient questions about insurers other than Medicare.As a result, the claims that would properly be billed to another payerare sometimes mistakenly billed to Medicare. In some instances, the intermediaryis able to identify the claim as an MSP claim and, at considerable expense,follow through to achieve the MSP savings. In many other instances, thereis no way for the intermediary to know that a particular beneficiary hasother insurance. In those cases, the claim is paid mistakenly and MSP savingsare lost unless the situation is later identified and recovery made. This problem is particularly acute when the health insurance policyholderis not the Medicare patient, but his or her spouse. There is no way ofidentifying this person (who may be under 65 years of age) through HCFA/SSArecords. Only the hospital can identify this type of MSP case. A second observation on program experience was made by the Office of theInspector General (OIG) in a memorandum dated March 18, 1985. The OIG reviewof hospitals indicates that some hospitals bill both Medicare and the otherinsurer (which is contrary to Medicare program instructions) and, insteadof refunding Medicare's payment, retain it, unless Medicare requests thatit be refunded. The hospital has no incentive to refund the money. Sinceit is unlikely that the intermediary will find the case and ask for therefund, the hospital keeps a credit balance on the patient account andholds the payment. Mistaken payments must be recovered. Medicare conditional payments, madewhen a claim against the other insurer is contested or payment is otherwisedelayed, are also subject to recovery. Recent legislation has a directbearing on this aspect of the program, as explained below. Statutory Changes <ITAG tagnum="81">A. Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 </ITAG>Section 2344 of the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 (Pub. L. 98-369) amendedsections 1862(b)(1), 1862(b)(2)(B), and 1862(b)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act asfollows: 1. Makes explicit the Federal government's right to recover from_ andbullet; Third parties that are required to pay before Medicare; and andbullet; Any entity (such as a beneficiary, provider, physician or Stateagency) that has received payment from a third party that is required topay before Medicare. 2. Provides that the government_ andbullet; Is subrogated to the right of any individual or other entity toreceive payments from a third party payer to the extent of Medicare payment;and andbullet; May join or intervene in any action related to the events thatgave rise to the need for the items or services for which Medicare paid.3. Adds the word ``promptly'' to section 1862(b)(1), thus providing thatMedicare payments are limited to the extent that payment has been madeor can reasonably be expected to be made ``promptly'' by workers' compensation,or automobile, liability, or no-fault insurance. Medicare makes conditionalprimary payments only if the other insurer will not pay promptly. 4. Adds the phrase ``or could be'' to sections 1862 (b)(1), (b)(2)(B),and (b)(3)(A)(ii), thus providing that Medicare conditional payments aresubject to recoupment when information is received that primary payment``could be'' made by a workers' compensation plan, an automobile, liability,or no-fault insurer, or an employer group health plan, even though paymenthas not yet been made. This change reinforces Medicare's position as secondarypayer, that is, it expressly permits HCFA to pursue recovery of conditionalor mistaken payments as soon as HCFA learns that another insurer is liablefor the payment. The provisions of section 2344 were self-implementing. A notice to thateffect was published on July 17, 1985 at 50 FR 28988. <ITAG tagnum="81">B. Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 </ITAG>Section 9201 of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985(Pub. L. 99-272 enacted April 7, 1986) eliminated the age 70 upper limitfor individuals subject to the working aged provision, effective May 1,1986. This amendment makes Medicare secondary payer to employer group healthplan coverage for employed individuals age 65 or over and spouses age 65or over of employed individuals of any age. Previously, Medicare was secondaryfor these individuals only until they attained age 70. <ITAG tagnum="81">C. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 </ITAG>1. <T3>Section 4036(a). </T3>Section 4036(a) of the Omnibus Budget ReconciliationAct of 1987 (Pub. L. 100-203), enacted December 22, 1987, provides thatMedicare may not make conditional primary payments on behalf of an ESRDbeneficiary who is covered by an employer group health plan if the plan``can reasonably be expected'' to pay. Under previous law, Medicare couldmake conditional primary payments if the Secretary determined that theplan would not pay as promptly as Medicare. This change makes the conditionalpayment criteria for ESRD beneficiaries the same as for working aged beneficiarieswho are covered by employer group health plans. This change is effectivefor services furnished on or after January 21, 1988. The section 4036(a)provision supersedes HCFA's implementation of a court order that was issuedin 1984 and is summarized below. In <T3>National Association of Patients on Hemodialysis </T3>v. <T3>Heckler </T3>(Civil Action No. 83-2210 (D.D.C.)), the district courtfor the District of Columbia held that HCFA's existing regulations, dealingwith conditional primary Medicare payments when Medicare is secondary toemployer group health plans for ESRD beneficiaries, were not consistentwith the statute. Those regulations provided that Medicare could pay conditionalprimary benefits only if the Medicare contractor knew from experience orascertained that the employer plan payments in general were substantiallyless prompt than Medicare's. The court held that the regulations were notconsistent with the statutory language which directed the Secretary todeny primary Medicare benefits only if_ andbullet; The employer group health plan has paid; or andbullet; The Secretary has determined that the employer plan will pay aspromptly as Medicare.Manual instructions implementing the court decision were issued in 1985.They stipulated that providers and suppliers were no longer required tobill the employer plan first in ESRD cases; they had the option to billMedicare first. Contractors were instructed to pay conditional Medicarebenefits if billed first and to attempt to recover later from the employerplan. 2. <T3>Section 4085(i)(15). </T3>Section 4085(i)(15) of Pub L. 100-203 providesa fourth exception to the exclusion of services that are not reasonab1eand necessary ``for the diagnosis or treatment of illness or injury orto improve the functioning of a malformed body member''. Under this amendment,Medicare payment is available for services that are reasonable and necessaryto carry out the purpose of the patient outcome assessment program establishedunder section 1875(c) of the Act. Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) On June 15, 1988, we published a notice (53 FR 22335) proposing to redesignateSubpart C of Part 405 of the Medicare rules as a new Part 411, and to revisethe rules to reflect the statutory changes discussed above and to providethe greatest possible uniformity in the policies applicable to third partypayer situations. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Summary of Analysis and Responses to Comments </ITAG>We received 51 timely letters of comment from hospitals and medical centers,religious organizations, insurance companies and carriers, health organizations,law firms, individuals, a hospice, a medical society, a veterans' organization,and a State agency. The changes proposed in the NPRM, the comments receivedon the proposals, and our responses to those comments are discussed below.General Comments <T3>Comment: </T3>The commenter suggested that, in the definitions of ``secondary''and ``secondary payments,'' the term ``insurance'' be replaced with themore generic ``coverage'', which would include self-funded plans. <T3>Response: </T3>We accepted this comment and revised andSection; 411.21accordingly. <T3>Comment: </T3>The commenter believes that the provisions of these regulationsshould not apply to hospice patients, because it is a disservice to discussprivate insurance benefits, copayments, and noncoverage with terminal patientsand their families. Also, the commenter believes it is discriminatory todeny Medicare benefits because Medicare beneficiaries have insurance thatis primary to Medicare. The commenter believes that involving private insurancecan cause billing problems that will create hardships for hospice patients.<T3>Response: </T3>There is no provision in the Medicare law that permitsHCFA to exempt hospice patients from Medicare secondary provisions. Ifa Medicare beneficiary has hospice coverage through an insurance plan thatis primary to Medicare, the law requires that the private insurance planpay first. Also, the hospice, as a Medicare participating provider, isobligated to elicit information from patients and their families regardinginsurance that is primary to Medicare. Hospices, not patients, are responsiblefor billing the other insurance. <T3>Comment: </T3>The commenter believes that the rules limiting Medicarepayments when no fault insurance, a workers' compensation plan, liabilityinsurance, or employer group health plans are primary to Medicare are detrimentalto small rural hospitals that are without staff attorneys and lack employeeswith legal backgrounds. Also, these rules and the rules for calculatingMedicare secondary payment amounts are much more complicated than necessary.<T3>Response: </T3>Hospitals need not have staff attorneys or personnelwith legal backgrounds in order to comply with these regulations. Ruralhospitals, like other Medicare participating providers, are required toelicit information from patients regarding insurance that may be primaryto Medicare and to bill third party payers that are primary to Medicare.This workload is necessitated by the law that makes certain third partypayers primary to Medicare. We do not believe that these rules and therules for calculating Medicare secondary payment amounts are excessivelycomplicated. <T3>Comments: </T3>One commenter considered that andSection;andSection; 411.43,411.65, and 411.75, which preclude Medicare conditional payments when abeneficiary fails to file a proper third party claim, are inconsistentwith the intent of the law in that they place health care providers atrisk of nonpayment for a beneficiary's lack of diligence, a factor overwhich providers have no control. The commenter believes that the regulationsshould clarify whether a provider may proceed against the beneficiary whenit was the beneficiary's responsibility to file a claim and the beneficiaryfailed to do so. Another commenter objected to andSection; 411.24(l), which allows HCFA torecover a conditional payment from a provider if a provider fails to filea proper claim for third party benefits. This commenter believes this provisionis inappropriate when beneficiaries fail to give a provider informationabout other insurance coverage. A third stated that andSection; 411.24(l) should contain a definition of``proper claim'' and indicate how to determine the amount a primary insurerwould reimburse a provider on the basis of a proper claim. <T3>Response: </T3>The statute would be circumvented if Medicare assumedfinancial liability for services for which a third party payer would pay,except for the fact that someone failed to file a proper claim. Providersand beneficiaries could place primary liability on Medicare simply by failingto bill third party payers properly. Accordingly, the general rule is thatMedicare will not make conditional payments when_ andbullet; A provider responsible for filing a third party claim on behalfof the beneficiary fails to file a proper claim; or andbullet; A beneficiary responsible for filing a third party claim failsto file a proper claim for any reason other than physical or mental incapacity.However, in response to the first two comments, this final rule makes thefollowing changes: Revises andSection; 411.24(l) to specify that Medicare will not recover fromthe provider if the provider can show that the beneficiary gave erroneousinformation about other insurance coverage, such as denying the employergroup health plan coverage that he or she has. (In such cases, the beneficiaryis responsible for repayment.) Revises proposed andSection; 489.20(i) to make clear that, under specifiedcircumstances, a provider may charge the beneficiary the amount of thethird party payment reduction attributable to failure to file a properclaim. This rule applies if the provider can show that_andbullet; It failed to file a proper claim solely because the beneficiary,for any reason other than physical or mental incapacity, failed to givethe provider the necessary information; or andbullet; The beneficiary, who was responsible for filing a proper claim,failed to do so for any reason other than physical or mental incapacity.``Proper claim'' is defined in andSection; 411.21. Providers can obtain informationfrom primary insurers with respect to the amount they would have paid theprovider on the basis of a proper claim. Accordingly, we have not adoptedthe third suggestion. <T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters suggested that HCFA make conditionalpayments when a group health plan that is primary to Medicare refuses topay primary benefits. The commenters consider that the proposed rules,by barring such payments, place the burden on health care providers toenforce the MSP provisions against recalcitrant employer group health plans.Commenters believe that Congress intended that HCFA pursue these claims.The commenters also believe that the conditional payment policy for grouphealth plans that are primary to Medicare, should be based on the same``promptness'' criterion that is applicable when a workers' compensationplan, or no-fault or liability insurance is primary to Medicare. <T3>Response: </T3>In the case of workers' compensation and no-fault orliability insurance, Congress included the word ``promptly'', indicatingthat Medicare should make conditional payments when payment by a thirdparty payer could not ``reasonably be expected to be made promptly''. Incontrast, Congress did not include a ``promptness'' criterion in provisionsregarding employer health plans: ``Payment under this title may not bemade * * * to the extent that payment * * * has been made, or can reasonablybe expected to be made under a group health plan.'' The statute thus indicates that Medicare should not pay when it is ``reasonable''to expect an employer group health plan to pay. If an employer plan isprimary to Medicare under the law, it is reasonable to expect the planto comply with the law. When a plan fails to comply with the law, it isthe provider's responsibility to pursue collection from the plan, justas it is the provider's responsibility to pursue collection in any othersituation in which a third party is responsible for payment. The statuteclearly does not provide that Medicare assume the financial burden of recoveringfrom employer plans that fail to meet their obligations under the law.Moreover, section 9319 of OBRA '86 amended section 1862(b) of the Act toadd a subsection (b)(5) to create a private right of action with doubledamages if a responsible third party fails to pay primary benefits. Itshould be noted that in these situations, providers are prohibited frombilling Medicare beneficiaries. <T3>Comment: </T3>Two commenters expressed general concern that HCFA hasbeen negligent in communicating with providers and group health plans abouttheir role in the Medicare secondary payer (MSP) program. One commenterstated that insurers and group health plans are hindered by lack of HCFAguidance with respect to coordination of benefits with Medicare and thatthe proposed regulations are inadequate in this respect. <T3>Response: </T3>HCFA recognizes that it is necessary to keep the communityat large informed about the MSP program. In an effort to increase publicawareness, since 1986 HCFA has engaged in a public information programabout MSP. This program has been targeted to reach employers, insurers,providers of services, and beneficiaries. Medicare contractors and othershave been meeting with the various target groups to provide the MSP message.However, we agree that the regulations ought to provide more specific guidancefor all third party payers with respect to coordination of benefits. Accordingly,we have added a new andSection; 411.25 to delineate the responsibilitiesof a third party payer when it discovers that HCFA has made a primary Medicarepayment in a situation in which the third party payer should have made,or did make, a primary payment. In summary, the third party must informHCFA of the specific situation, and describe the circumstances (such astype of coverage and MSP category), and specify the time period duringwhich it is the primary payer. In making this change, we discovered that we had inadvertently failed toinclude in andSection; 411.21 a general definition of ``plan'' applicableto all categories of third party payers under section 1862(b) of the Act.We have corrected this oversight. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter was concerned that unpaid claims were returnedto providers inappropriately because erroneous data was included in HCFA'sregional data exchange system. <T3>Response: </T3>HCFA is continually improving the regional data exchangesystem to eliminate erroneous data. Erroneous or outdated information iscorrected upon receipt and verification. <T3>Comment: </T3>The proposed rules require that the beneficiary mustcooperate in HCFA's action to recover benefits from a primary payer. Thecommenter believes that HCFA should provide due process rights for beneficiariesand advise beneficiaries via published guidelines exactly the duties thatare imposed on them by the word ``cooperate.'' <T3>Response: </T3>HCFA has enumerated the conditions of beneficiary responsibilityin andSection;andSection; 411.43, 411.51, 411.65, and 411.75. Essentially,beneficiaries are responsible for filing claims with a third party payeror informing providers of coverage that is primary to Medicare so thatproviders may bill the third party payers on their behalf. Standard dueprocess provisions apply to recovery of conditional payments from beneficiaries.To Implement Statutory Amendments <ITAG tagnum="81">A. Prompt Payment </ITAG>1. <T3>Proposal. </T3>To implement the statutory amendment that added theword ``promptly'' to section 1862(b)(1) of the Act, we proposed that Medicaremake conditional primary payments when the workers' compensation carrieror the no-fault insurer will not pay promptly, that is, within 120 daysafter receipt of the claim. We did not propose to change the existing rules for liability insurance.Medicare makes conditional primary payments if the beneficiary has filedor has a right to file a liability claim. However, because of a court decision,a special rule applies in Oregon. Under this rule, the ``promptness'' criterionapplies to liability claims involving Oregon hospitals. This is discussedunder section G.3., of this preamble. 2. <T3>Comments and responses. </T3><T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters expressed concern that the definitionof ``promptly'', as applied to conditional payment, requires a providerto wait for payment for an excessive period of time after the potentialprimary payer has denied the claim. One commenter suggested that when thereare multiple payers that are primary to Medicare the promptness periodshould not apply to each payee individually.<T3>Response: </T3>The 120 days is the maximum amount of time a providermight have to wait for a third party payment before billing Medicare. Ifthe provider can document that a potential primary payer will not pay theclaim_for example, with a written rejection of the claim, it can submitthe bill to Medicare without further delay. Since a payer that is primaryto Medicare cannot pay until it is billed, the 120-day period must applyto each payer. If the provider receives a partial payment or a denial ofpayment from one primary payer and then bills another, the 120-day periodwould apply in the case of the second billing as well. <ITAG tagnum="81">B. Authority to Recover as Soon as Liability Is Known to Exist, Subrogation,and Right to Intervene </ITAG>1. <T3>Proposal. </T3>As discussed above under ``Statutory Changes'', theaddition of the phrase ``or could be'' makes explicit that HCFA can seekrecovery of conditional primary payments when it learns that another partyis primary payer, without waiting for the other party to actually pay (411.24(b)).If HCFA is unable to recover conditional Medicare payments from a beneficiaryor other party that receives payment from an entity that is primary toMedicare, HCFA has the right to recover its payment from that entity inspite of the fact that the entity has already reimbursed the beneficiaryor other party (andSection; 411.24(i)). Therefore, entities that are primaryto Medicare should ensure that Medicare has no claim against payments theyplan to make to individuals who are entitled to Medicare benefits. HCFA's clarified recovery rights, including subrogation and the right tointervene, apply to all payers that are primary to Medicare. These rightsare set forth in andSection; 411.24 and andSection; 411.26. In view of the clarified recovery rights, we proposed to remove the requirement(in andSection; 405.319(b) of the current rules) for obtaining a repaymentagreement from the beneficiary as a prerequisite for Medicare conditionalpayment in workers' compensation cases.2. <T3>Comments and responses.</T3><T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters objected to andSection; 411.24(b), whichpertains to HCFA's authority to recover any conditional payment made toa provider even if the provider has not received any payment from a thirdparty payer. The commenters believe that HCFA should recoup conditionalpayments only after a primary payer has actually made payment, not whenpayment ``could be made''. If HCFA recovers when payment ``could be made'',HCFA should pay interest of 12 percent per annum if the third party isultimately determined not to be primary to Medicare. <T3>Response: </T3>Under the law, HCFA has the right to recoup conditionalMedicare payments from a provider or other person when it learns that payment``could be made'' to the provider or other person by a third party payer.However, it is HCFA's policy to first attempt to recover from the thirdparty payer. Thus, as a practical matter, HCFA does not recover from aprovider that has not received a third party payment. HCFA may requesta provider to bill a designated primary payer. In such cases, HCFA's requestnotifies the provider that HCFA will recover its conditional payment. There is no provision in the Medicare law that would permit Medicare topay interest in the event that an insurer, which HCFA believes to be aprimary payer, ultimately is determined not to be primary to Medicare.In this situation, the provider or other person must resubmit its claimto Medicare. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter believes that the use of the term ``entity''in andSection; 411.24(d) (which states: ``HCFA may recover by direct collectionor by offset against monies HCFA owes the entity responsible for refundingthe conditional payment'') is an attempt to include employer group healthplans and insurers in the application of this section. Group health plansand insurers would never be in receipt of conditional Medicare paymentand would therefore not be responsible for refunding this payment. <T3>Response: </T3>Under the law, conditional Medicare payments may berecovered from any entity responsible for primary payment, for example,employers, insurers, underwriters, and third party administrators, as wellas from any entity that received a conditional payment, such as a provideror beneficiary. The liability of entities responsible for payment is moredirectly addressed in section 411.24(e), which states: ``HCFA has a directright of action to recover from any entity responsible for making primarypayment. This includes an employer, an insurance carrier, plan, or program,and a third party administrator.'' <T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters objected to andSection;andSection; 411.24(e) and (g), which respectively reflect HCFA's right to recover from anyentity responsible for paying primary benefits for services or any entitythat has been paid by a third party payer. One commenter believes statutoryliability for payment is imposed only on an employer group health planand cannot be extended to insurers or administrators of the plan. The commentersuggested that the regulation be amended to reflect that an insurer oradministrator cannot be liable to HCFA if it has not assumed the liabilityin its contract with the employer or plan. Another commenter said thatHCFA should recover from either the employer or the employer's insurancecarrier. Otherwise, the commenter believes that HCFA can receive ``doublerecovery'' under andSection; 411.24(e) because this provision does not providefor return of monies collected to either the insurer or employer. <T3>Response: </T3>Sections 411.24 (e) and (g) reflect statutory authority.Sections 1862(b) (2) and (3) of the Social Security Act both state, inpart: ``In order to recover payment made under this title [title XVIII]for an item or service, the United States may bring an action against <T3>any entity </T3>which would be responsible for payment with respectto such item or service (or any portion thereof) <T3>under such a plan, </T3>or against any entity * * * which has beenpaid with respect to such item or service under such plan, * * *'' (Emphasisadded.) Employers, insurers, underwriters and third party administratorsare responsible for making payments ``under such a plan'' in accordancewith the coverage provisions of the group health plan and in accordancewith the law that makes group health plan coverage primary to Medicare.In cases in which the Medicare provisions conflict with a health plan provisionor contract, the Medicare law must prevail. (<T3>Colonial Penn Insurance Co. </T3>v. <T3>Heckler, </T3>721, F 2d 431 (3rd Cir. 1983) and <T3>Abrams </T3>v. <T3>Heckler, </T3>582 F. Supp. 1115 (S.D.N.Y. 1984). Accordingly, Medicarehas the right to recover from any of those entities.Third party administrators, insurers and underwriters hold themselves outas having expertise in health plan administration and being knowledgeableabout the various legal and other requirements applicable to health plans,party administrators, insurers, and underwriters submit claims and makepayment decisions on a day-to-day basis, often without direct involvementof the entity (such as the employer) that may <T3>ultimately </T3>be responsible for payment. Accordingly, it is appropriatefor Medicare to recover directly from the third party administrator orinsurer, and leave that entity to seek whatever recourse is available toit under its contract or other arrangement. Also, as stipulated in the law, HCFA may recover from any entity that hasreceived payment with respect to a service. HCFA will not pursue duplicaterecoveries. Once HCFA recovers its benefits on any particular claim, itwill not seek to recover the same benefits from another entity. We haveamended proposed andSection; 411.24(e) to make clear that third party administratorsare among the entities responsible for refunding conditional Medicare payments.<T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters objected to andSection; 411.24(f), whichstates that HCFA may recover without regard to any claims filing requirementsimposed by the insurance program or plan, and applicable to the beneficiary,such as a time limit for filing a claim or a time limit for notifying aplan or program about the need for, or receipt of, services. The commentersbelieve that HCFA should be required to comply with the claims filing requirementsof all insurers and health care coverage benefit plans. Also, HCFA shouldbe required to make a claim within 1 year after a service has been furnished.The commenters believe that this section appears to unconstitutionallyinfringe upon contractual rights and obligations and purports to give HCFAgreater rights than are afforded a person or group to whom an insurer issuesa particular contract. Some contract provisions include specific time limitsfor filing and/or a reduction or complete loss of benefits for servicesthat are not pre-approved. One commenter also stated that these contractprovisions would also apply to services furnished by non-participatingproviders to an HMO member in a non-emergency situation without approvalby the HMO. This would significantly affect participation in current Medicarerisk-based HMO contracts. This proposal would also abrogate contract provisionsestablishing timely filing and other procedural requirements. <T3>Response: </T3>This comment is acceptable in part. HCFA cannot be boundby the insurer's time frames for filing claims because those periods beginwith the date of service. Under such a rule, HCFA would be unable to recoverits benefits if it did not learn that the particular insurer is primaryto Medicare until after the claim filing period expired. This would conflict with the Medicare law. Congress expressly provideda direct right of recovery which begins ``when notice or other informationis received'' (Section 1862(b) (1), (2), and (3)). Although Medicare'sseparately articulated subrogation rights, also contained in these sections,may be affected by a beneficiary's awareness of a claims filing limitation,Medicare's direct right of recovery is clearly unaffected by the concernsthat the commenters express. Moreover, Federal law would overcome conflictingcontractual or State law provisions. (See <T3>Colonial Penn Insurance Co. </T3>v. <T3>Heckler </T3>721 F.2d 431 (3rd Cir. 1983) and <T3>Abrams </T3>v. <T3>Heckler, </T3>582 F.Supp. 1155 (S.D.N.Y. 1984).) We agree, however, that HCFA should observe some reasonable timeframe forfiling claims_one that is similar to the timeframe for filing Medicareclaims. Specifically, HCFA will file its claim by the end of the year followingthe year in which the Medicare contractor that paid the claim has noticethat the insurer or other third party is primary payer for the particularservices, and that Medicare's primary payment is, therefore, recoverable.(Notices received during the last three months of a year are consideredto have been received in the following year.) This timeframe has the advantage of being familiar to individuals involvedin the Medicare claims process. As we have stated, under the law, the dateHCFA receives such notice is the day that HCFA's claim arises. HCFA cannotbe responsible for filing a claim within a period that starts before theMedicare intermediary or carrier that paid the claim has notice that providesthe basis for recovery. We have revised proposed andSection; 411.24(f) accordingly.We do not see how andSection; 411.24(f) would adversely affect HMOs becausethe regulations applicable to HMOs are at andSection; 417.528 of the Medicarerules. In addition, in the case of risk-basis HMOs_ andbullet; Payment is on a prospective capitation basis and the payment isnot reduced retroactively; and andbullet; Medicare does not make any payments if a Medicare beneficiarygoes outside an employer group prepaid health plan (such as an HCPP orHMO), when the same type of services could have been obtained or can bepaid for by the HMO. This means that if Medicare pays in error, the entirepayment is an overpayment. Furthermore, under andSection; 417.528, both cost and risk HMOs may chargean employer group health plan or another organization that is a primarypayer for covered services that were furnished by the HMO. <T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters suggested deleting the rule (andSection;411.24(i)), which provides that if HCFA is unable to recover from a partythat received a third party payment, HCFA may recover from the third partypayer even though it has already reimbursed the beneficiary or other party.The commenters believe that there is no justification for compelling athird party payer to pay the same claim twice. <T3>Response: </T3>This comment is acceptable in part. Third party payersare responsible for reimbursing the proper party. Under section 1862(b)of the Act, HCFA is subrogated to ``any right of an individual or any otherentity to payment.'' The statute clearly gives the Medicare program a priorityright of recovery. It is reasonable to expect a primary payer to take stepsto ensure that it pays the proper party.We agree that when an employer group health plan (EGHP) or no-fault insurerroutinely pays primary benefits on behalf of a Medicare beneficiary withoutknowledge of Medicare's primary payment, the insurer has acted responsiblyand should not be liable for reimbursing HCFA if HCFA is unable to recoverfrom the party that received the insurer's primary payment. However, ifa third party pays an entity other than Medicare even though it was, orshould have been, aware that Medicare had made a conditional primary payment,the third party must reimburse Medicare. We have modified the proposed andSection; 411.24(i) so that it applies onlyto these circumstances and to liability insurance settlements and disputedEGHP and no-fault claims. Liability insurers should be aware of Medicare involvement, and thereforeshould not pay a claim without first checking to find out if Medicare hasmade conditional payments. The EGHP or no-fault insurer should be awarethat, if the claim was disputed, Medicare may have made a conditional payment.Accordingly, if the insurer later decides to pay the claim, it should contactMedicare to determine Medicare's claim and obtain advice regarding reimbursement.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter stated that andSection; 411.24(k), whichpermits recovery of conditional payments from a Medicare intermediary orcarrier by offsetting funds due the intermediary or carrier, is contraryto the Administrative Procedures Act and in violation of a contractor'sagreement. <T3>Response:</T3> The Federal Claims Collection Act (FCCA) regulationsrequire government agencies to pursue aggressively collection of a debtdue the United States (4 CFR 102.1). If the debtor refuses to pay, offsetagainst any amount owed by the government is one recommended method ofcollection. Authority to offset is well established under common law andis also found in andSection; 401.607(a)(2) of the Medicare regulations andin Departmental regulations at 42 CFR 30.15(c)(5). The FCCA does not precludea debtor from pursuing applicable administrative or judicial remedies ifoffset is applied. We have broadened the provision to apply to contractors,including intermediaries and carriers, as authorized under the law. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter expressed the view that the proposed ruleswould place unreasonable burdens on physicians because it would be necessaryfor physicians to become expert in insurance rules, particularly the rulesthat govern primary and secondary payments. The commenter argues that physicianscannot be expected to acquire such knowledge, and, therefore, the ruleswould inappropriately put physicians at financial risk. <T3>Response: </T3>These regulations do not place unreasonable burdenson physicians or put physicians ``at risk.'' Physicians who accept assignmentare responsible under the regulations to attempt to identify, and filea proper claim with, any third party that is primary to Medicare. If physiciansfollow this procedure and bill primary insurers first, Medicare will bebilled only as secondary payer. A physician who follows the proper proceduresbut is unable to identify a third party that is primary to Medicare maybill Medicare in the usual manner, and would not be at risk. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter believes that the proposed rule does notclearly state that Medicare is primary payer with respect to Medicaid.The commenter suggested that the final rule clearly state that Medicaidis an exception to the rules for Medicare as secondary payer. <T3>Response:</T3> The proposed rule did not, and this final rule doesnot, change the order of payment between Medicare and Medicaid. It is notnecessary for the regulations to state that Medicare is primary payer withrespect to Medicaid. The law dealing with Medicare as secondary payer makesMedicare secondary only to workers' compensation, no-fault insurance, liabilityinsurance, and certain group health plans. Since the regulations do notstate that Medicaid pays before Medicare, the existing order of paymentremains unchanged, that is, Medicare is primary; Medicaid is the payerof last resort. However, andSection; 411.26(a) provides that Medicare has a right to recoverbefore Medicaid from any third party entity that, under section 1862(b)of the Act, is primary to both Medicare and Medicaid. Thus, if both Medicareand Medicaid have paid for services covered by such a third party payerand the amount payable by the third party is insufficient to reimburseboth programs in full, Medicare must recover first. Medicare's priorityright of recovery is appropriate and does not violate the concept of Medicaidbeing the payer of last resort. Under section 1862(b) of the Act, the Medicareprogram (1) may recover its benefits from a third party payer, (2) is subrogatedto the right of a Medicare beneficiary and the right of <T3>any other</T3> entity to payment by a third party payer, and (3) mayrecover its payments from <T3>any</T3> entity that has been paid by a third party payer. Medicare'sultimate statutory authority is not to pay at all (with a concomitant rightto recover any conditional benefits paid) if payment can reasonably beexpected by a third party that is primary to Medicare. If a third partypays, Medicare makes no payment to the extent of the third party payment.Delay of a third party payment does not change Medicare's ultimate obligationto pay the correct amount, if any, regardless of any Medicare paymentsconditionally made. Thus, if a third party pays less than the charges,Medicare may be responsible for paying secondary benefits. If a third partypays the charges, Medicare may not pay at all. Pro-rata or other sharing of recoveries with Medicaid would have the effectof creating a Medicare payment when none is authorized under the law orimproperly increasing the amount of any Medicare secondary payment. <ITAG tagnum="81">C. Self-implementing Statutory Changes </ITAG>The following changes were based on self-implementing provisions of thestatute that did not require us to exercise any discretion in implementingthe corresponding regulation changes. We received no public comments onthese provisions. 1. Removal of upper age limit for working aged. This change is reflectedin andSection; 411.70 of these final regulations. 2. Coverage of services that are reasonable and necessary to carry outthe purposes of the patient outcome evaluation program. This change isreflected in andSection; 411.15(k)(4) of these final regulations. To Implement Policy Changes <ITAG tagnum="81">A. To Ensure Identification of Other Payers that Are Primary to Medicareand Prompt Reimbursement When the Beneficiary, Provider, or Supplier ReceivesPayment from these Payers</ITAG>1. <T3>Background. </T3>a. Part 489 of the Medicare rules deals with provideragreements. Section 489.20, which sets forth the commitments that a providermust make when it executes a provider agreement, did not include any requirementthat the provider identify other insurance, bill primary payers beforebilling Medicare or refund Medicare payments that duplicate payments bya payer that is primary to Medicare. Previous rules did not expressly addressHCFA's right to obtain information from another payer with whom a claimhad been or could have been filed. Although the changes in the law haveclarified HCFA's ability to recover conditional payments, it is obviousthat there can be no recovery without identification of other insurersthat are primary to Medicare. Furthermore, in order to determine Medicare's proper payment under thelaw, it may be necessary for HCFA to contact other payers that may be primaryto Medicare with regard to benefit coordination. 2. <T3>Proposal. </T3>We proposed to amend andSection; 489.20 to require providersto make four additional commitments, as follows: a. To maintain a system for identifying, during the admission process,other payers that are primary to Medicare. b. Except in the case of liability insurance, to bill the other insurerfirst. c. When it receives payment from both Medicare and another payer that isprimary to Medicare, to reimburse Medicare within 30 days of receipt ofthe duplicate payment (Section 411.24, which deals with HCFA's recoveryrights, would also require beneficiaries and other parties that receiveduplicate payments to reimburse HCFA within 30 days of receipt of the duplicatepayment.) d. If it receives, from a payer that is primary to Medicare, a paymentthat is reduced because the provider failed to file a proper claim withthat payer_ andbullet; To bill Medicare only to the extent that secondary benefits wouldhave been payable if the primary insurer had reimbursed the provider onthe basis of a proper claim; and andbullet; To charge the beneficiary no more than it would have been entitledto charge if it had filed a proper claim with the primary insurer. (This fourth commitment is discussed under section H of this preamble,which deals with Medicare Secondary Payments.) We proposed to stipulate, in andSection; 411.24(a), that the filing of aMedicare claim, by or on behalf of the beneficiary, expressly authorizesthe third party payer to release any information pertinent to the Medicareclaim. 3. <T3>Comments and responses. </T3><T3>Comment_</T3>One commenter objected to the requirement that would beadded to the provider agreement with respect to primary payments reducedbecause of failure to file a proper claim. Under the new requirement, aprovider who had received a reduced payment from a primary insurer becauseit had not filed a proper claim with that insurer would be permitted_ andbullet; To bill Medicare only to the extent that secondary benefits wouldhave been payable if the primary payer had not reduced its payment becauseof the lack of a proper claim; and andbullet; To charge the beneficiary no more than it would have been entitledto charge if it had filed a proper claim. The commenter stated that, under contract law, the beneficiary should beresponsible to pay the hospital the difference in payment that is attributableto the provider's failure to bill properly.<T3>Response:</T3> The changes to andSection; 489.20 require the providerto maintain a system to identify other primary payers and to bill thembefore billing Medicare, except in the case of liability insurance. Theprovider must, needless to say, submit a proper bill to the primary payerin order to obtain the payment due. The Secretary establishes the conditions for participation in the Medicareprogram. A provider, if it wishes to participate in Medicare, must agreeto comply with these conditions. We believe that neither the beneficiarynor Medicare should be responsible for reimbursing a provider for a primarypayer's reduction of payment when that reduction is the result of the provider'sfailure to submit a proper claim as required. As discussed earlier in thispreamble, we would make an exception if the provider can show that itsfailure to file a proper claim was solely the beneficiary's fault. <T3>Comment:</T3> Several commenters were concerned with the provisionof andSection; 489.20(h), which requires the refund of any Medicare paymentwithin 30 days of receipt of the duplicate third party payment. One commenterstated that duplicate payments are entered into a credit balance account,which is reviewed monthly, but frequently it takes longer than 30 daysto identify the party to whom the refund is due. <T3>Response:</T3> Many providers do not refund credit balances until thosebalances are identified and reported by HCFA auditors. Accordingly, webelieve it is necessary to require that providers regularly review thoseaccounts and make refunds to Medicare as may be appropriate. In view ofthe difficulty some providers may encounter, we will change the time limitfor refunds from 30 days to 60 days of receipt of the subsequent payment.<T3>Comment:</T3> Several commenters objected to the requirement that hospitalsmaintain a system which, during the admissions process, identifies anyprimary payers other than Medicare. Some of these commenters envision detailedand costly data processing systems. <T3>Response:</T3> Section 489.20(f) incorporates into regulations a requiredpractice that is currently found in the provider manuals. This requirementis that providers question beneficiaries during the admissions processto identify potential other party payers. This is not a new requirementand has not been found to be costly or burdensome. <T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter expressed concern that andSection; 411.24(a),(which states that the filing of a claim by or on behalf of a beneficiaryconstitutes an express authorization for release to Medicare of any informationpertinent to the Medicare claim) may violate the National Association ofInsurance Commissioners (NAIC) Model Insurance Privacy and ConfidentialityAct. <T3>Response:</T3> Authorization to release information necessary to processthe claim is part of the Medicare claims filing procedures. This rule givesnotice to third party insurers and other entities (including State Medicaidand workers' compensation agencies, and data depositories) that anyonefiling a Medicare claim has authorized Medicare to obtain information relevantto that claim. We recognize that Medicaid programs are not third party payers, that is,are not primary to Medicare. However, a Medicaid agency may have informationthat is relevant to a Medicare claim against a third party. A State Medicaidagency must release any information pertinent to a Medicare claim on request.HCFA will use the information for Medicare claims processing and coordinationof benefits purposes only. <ITAG tagnum="81">B. To Reflect a Changed Interpretation of the ``Immediate Relative''Exclusion </ITAG>1. <T3>Background. </T3>a. Section 1862(a)(11) of the Act precludes paymentfor expenses that ``constitute charges imposed by an immediate relativeof the beneficiary or a member of the beneficiary's household''. PreviousandSection; 405.315, which implemented what is commonly referred to as the``immediate relative exclusion''_ (1) Referred only to Medicare Part B; (2) Barred payment for charges other than actual costs incurred by thephysician or other person (hereafter referred to as ``out-of-pocket expenses'')for items furnished to relatives or household members; (3) Defined ``immediate relative'' and ``member of household''; (4) Noted that the person who imposes the charges may be a person otherthan the one who furnished the services; (5) Exempted from the exclusion_ (a) Charges imposed by a partnership except when all the partners bearthe excluded relationship to the patient; and (b) Charges imposed by a corporation, regardless of the beneficiary's relationshipto the directors, officers, and stockholders of the corporation; and (6) Made the exclusion applicable to charges imposed by an individual proprietorshipif the individual who owns and operates the business is an immediate relativeor member of the beneficiary's household. b. Reexamination of andSection; 405.315 led us to conclude that our previousinterpretation of section 1862(a)(11) of the Act was inconsistent withthe purpose of that provision, namely_(1) To bar Medicare payment for items and services that would ordinarilybe furnished gratis because of the relationship of the provider or physicianto the beneficiary; and (2) To avoid payment for medically unnecessary services.c. Congress recognized that, in family situations, it is difficult to differentiatebetween medically necessary services and those that are furnished becauseof affection or concern. Thus, the exclusion was also intended to guardagainst potential program abuse. The prohibition is unqualified. Neither the statutory language nor thelegislative history support certain of our previous interpretations underwhich we_ (1) Limited the exclusion to services of physicians and suppliers, payableon a charge basis under Medicare Part B, while continuing to pay for servicespayable under Medicare Part A, and for actual out-of-pocket expenses incurredby physicians or suppliers to furnish their relatives items such as drugsor prosthetic devices; and (2) Exempted from the exclusion physicians who are members of a partnershipor corporation. d. We have concluded that Congress intended to exclude the following: (1) Services furnished under Medicare Part A as well as under MedicarePart B. (2) All charges imposed by persons having an excluded relationship, includingout-of-pocket expenses. (3) Services furnished by physicians who are immediate relatives or householdmembers, regardless of whether they work within a partnership or a professionalcorporation, or as individual practitioners. 2. <T3>Proposal. </T3>We proposed to revise andSection; 405.315 (redesignatedas andSection; 411.12) to_a. Remove the reference to Medicare Part B, so that the exclusion appliesto both parts of the Medicare program; b. Remove the exemption of out-of-pocket expenses; c. Amend the definition of ``immediate relative'' to include adoptive siblingand spouse of grandparent or grandchild, which were omitted inadvertently;and d. Specify that the exclusion applies to the following: (1) Physician services and services furnished incident to those servicesif the physician who furnished the services or who ordered or supervisedservices incident to his or her services has an excluded relationship tothe beneficiary, even if the bill or claim is submitted by a nonrelatedindividual or by an entity such as a partnership or a professional corporation.(2) Services other than physician services when charges are imposed by_(a) An individually owned provider or supplier, if the owner has an excludedrelationship to the beneficiary; or (b) A partnership, if any of the partners has an excluded relationshipto the beneficiary. Charges imposed by a corporation other than a professional corporationwould not be excluded. 3. <T3>Comments and responses. </T3>We received no comments on these proposals.<ITAG tagnum="81">C. To Clarify the ``No Legal Obligation to Pay'' Exclusion as It Appliesto Services Furnished to Prisoners </ITAG>1. <T3>Background. </T3>Section 405.311, which implemented section 1862(a)(2)of the Act, precludes Medicare payment for services when_ andbullet; The individual who receives the services has no legal obligationto pay for them; and andbullet; No other person has a legal obligation to provide or pay for thoseservices. Prisoners generally have the status of public charges and as such, haveno obligation to pay for the medical care they receive. Under those circumstances,previous andSection; 405.311 barred Medicare payment. However, andSection;405.311 was not clear concerning the applicalion of the exclusion whena prisoner received services and is legally obligated to pay for the services.General instructions issued by HCFA provide for payment in the latter circumstances.Under those instructions, the fact that State law or regulation providesthat certain prisoners or groups of prisoners may be charged for medicalcare is not enough to establish legal obligation. It is necessary to showthat the State regularly enforces the legal obligation by routinely billingand seeking collection from all these prisoners for medical care they receive.2. <T3>Proposal. </T3>We proposed to specify in the pertinent rule (now andSection;411.4) that Medicare payment for services to prisoners may be made_andbullet; Only if State law requires prisoners to repay the cost of theservices; and andbullet; Only if the State actually enforces the requirement by billingand pursuing collection of amounts owed in the same way and with the samevigor that it pursues the collection of other debts. 3. <T3>Comments and responses. </T3>Comment: The commenter believes that State and local officials try to avoidpaying for medical care furnished to persons in their custody but who arenot formally charged with a crime. For Medicare to benefit from the provisionin andSection; 411.4 relating to prisoners, the commenter believes that localofficials would have to be held responsible for anyone in their custodywhether or not they have been charged. <T3>Response: </T3>Section 411.4 provides that Medicare will not pay forservices furnished to persons in the custody of State and local officialsunder a penal statute whether or not they have been formally charged witha crime. The regulation is in accord with State law and legal precedentsthat require State and local penal officials to provide persons in theircustody with a reasonable level of medical care. It is unnecessary forthe regulation to hold officials so responsible, even if that could bedone by Federal regulation. If a provider encounters an official that disclaimsresponsibility for furnishing care to a beneficiary in custody, the providermay enlist the aid of its Medicare intermediary to inform the officialthat Medicare will not pay in these cases. The intermediary may also explainthe circumstances under which the regulations allow Medicare payment whenState law and practice hold individuals responsible for paying for medicalcare furnished by the State.D. To Clarify the Rules on the Exclusion of Services Furnished Outsidethe United States 1. <T3>Background. </T3>Section 405.313 of the previous rules, based on section1862(a)(4) of the Act_andbullet; Excluded services that are not furnished within the United States;and andbullet; Defined the ``United States'' to include the 50 States, the Districtof Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam,and American Samoa. General instructions issued by HCFA further specify that_ andbullet; U.S. territorial waters are part of the United States; and andbullet; Shipboard services furnished in a U.S. port or on the same daythe ship arrived at, or departed from, that port are considered as furnishedin U.S. territorial waters. There were three reasons for revising this rule: andbullet; The definition of ``United States'' needed to be expanded to includethe Northern Mariana Islands. Under the Covenant to establish the Commonwealthof the Northern Mariana Islands (Pub. L. 94-241), effective January 9,1978, ``those laws which provide Federal services and financial assistanceprograms * * *'' apply to the Marianas as they do to Guam. andbullet; The ``same day'' rule was too vague and too broad to be satisfactory.It could result in claims for services furnished in a foreign port (forexample, in the Bahamas) that is less than 24 hours sailing distance froma U.S. port. andbullet; Despite the specific language of the current definition of ``UnitedStates'', people tended to think that facilities owned and operated bythe U.S. government are part of the United States, no matter where in theworld they are located. As a result of this misconception, we frequentlyreceived claims for services furnished in U.S. Army hospitals in Europe,the Canal Zone, etc., and requests for hearings on the denial of benefitsfor those services. 2. <T3>Proposal. </T3>Consistent with the preceding discussion, we proposedto_ andbullet; Add the Northern Mariana Islands and U.S. territorial waters tothe definition of the United States; andbullet; Specify that shipboard services are considered furnished in U.S.territorial waters if they are furnished while a ship is in a U.S. portor within 6 hours before arrival at, or after departure from, a U.S. port;and andbullet; Specify that a hospital that is not located within the UnitedStates as defined, is not part of the United States even though it is ownedor operated by the U.S. government. 3. <T3>Comments and responses. </T3>We received no comments on these proposals.<ITAG tagnum="81">E. To Update and Clarify Policies on Services Covered under Workers'Compensation </ITAG>1. <T3>Background. </T3>The workers' compensation rules needed revision toremove outdated content and to make them consistent with the rules pertainingto other types of insurance that are primary to Medicare. Some of the rules had become obsolete because workers' compensation lawsand plans and medical care delivery systems have changed. For example,the laws and plans have fewer limitations on number of days of care andamounts payable, and ward accommodations are no longer used. 2. <T3>Proposal. </T3>In the NPRM, we proposed to_ andbullet; Delete obsolete provisions, including those that deal with limitationsin workers' compensation laws regarding the number of days of care or theamount payable, and payment for ward accommodations. andbullet; Delete the provision dealing with Medicare payment for ancillaryservices not payable by workers' compensation. These cases would be coveredby andSection;andSection; 411.32 and 411.33, which set forth the basis andamounts of Medicare secondary payments when a third party payer does notpay in full. andbullet; Stipulate that the beneficiary must cooperate in any action HCFAtakes against a workers' compensation carrier. Since this rule appliesto all entities that are primary to Medicare, it would be set forth inandSection; 411.23. andbullet; Apply workers' compensation payments toward Medicare deductibleamounts (andSection; 411.30). andbullet; Specify different policies for lump sum workers' compensationpayments that are commutations of future benefits (andSection; 411.46), andthose that are compromise settlements (andSection; 411.47). andbullet; Make clear that Medicare does not pay for services for which paymentwould have been made under the Federal Black Lung Program administeredby the Department of Labor (DOL) if the DOL fails to pay solely becausethe provider did not obtain a provider number that must be included withthe claim for DOL payment (andSection; 411.40(b)). 3. <T3>Comments and responses. </T3><T3>Comment: </T3>Section 411.40 makes a provider responsible for the paymentof services if payment could have been made under the Black Lung Program,but is precluded because the provider failed to obtain a provider numberfrom the DOL. A commenter suggested that this provision ignores normalcontract law, which holds a patient responsible for the services. <T3>Response: </T3>While it is true that a Medicare beneficiary is ultimatelyresponsible for services that are not payable by Medicare, providers alsohave obligations to their patients and to the Medicare program under theirprovider agreements. Provider numbers are routinely issued by the DOL andare needed in order for Black Lung claims to be processed. We do not believethat it is unreasonable for Medicare as the secondary payer to requirea provider to comply with a routine obligation of this nature. <ITAG tagnum="81">F. To Incorporate Changed Policy on No-fault Insurance </ITAG>1. <T3>Background. </T3>With respect to no-fault insurance, current rules_andbullet; Applied only to <T3>automobile </T3>no-fault, not to other kinds of no-fault insurancesuch as homeowners; andbullet; Provided for Medicare conditional payment if the no-fault insurancepayment will be delayed ``for any reason'';andbullet; Did not address the beneficiary's responsibility for obtainingpayment under no-fault insurance; and andbullet; Did not permit third party payments to be credited against theMedicare deductibles. (This limitation also applied to payments under workers'compensation, automobile medical and liability insurance.) We believe that_andbullet; Medicare should be secondary payer to all types of no-fault insurance,not just automobile no-fault, since the law is not limited to automobileno fault. andbullet; Medicare should not make a conditional payment when a no-faultinsurer refuses to pay primary benefits on the grounds that it is secondaryto Medicare. andbullet; Beneficiaries should be responsible for taking necessary actionto obtain any payments that can reasonably be expected under no-fault insuranceas they are required to do in the case of workers' compensation. andbullet; All third party payments should be credited against the Medicaredeductibles. (The more recent amendments provide for employer plan paymentsto be credited.) 2. <T3>Proposal.</T3> We proposed the following changes: andbullet; In andSection; 411.50(b), to expand the definition of ``no-faultinsurance'' to include all other types of no-fault insurance, in additionto automobile no-fault. andbullet; In andSection; 411.53, to provide that Medicare conditional paymentwill not be made if the no-fault insurance payment will be delayed becausethe insurer claims that its benefits are secondary to Medicare benefits.andbullet; In andSection; 411.51, to require that beneficiaries take any necessaryaction to obtain payment under no-fault insurance, and specify the circumstancesunder which Medicare does or does not pay. andbullet; In andSection; 411.30, to provide that all third party paymentsare credited towards the Medicare deductibles. 3. <T3>Comments and responses.</T3> <T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter objected to the expanded definition ofno-fault insurance in section 411.50, which provides that Medicare is secondaryto non-automobile no-fault insurance such as home owners and commercialinsurance. The commenter stated that ``no-fault'' insurance is unique toautomobile insurance and, therefore, the term should not be defined toinclude non-automobile insurance. <T3>Response:</T3> The expanded definition of no-fault insurance is basedon the language of section 1862(b)(1) of the Act, which reads, in part:``Payment under this title may not be made with respect to any item orservice to the extent payment has been made, or can reasonably be expectedto be made promptly * * * under a workmen's compensation law or plan ** * or under an automobile <T3>or</T3> liability insurance policy or plan (including a self insuranceplan) <T3>or</T3> under no-fault insurance.'' (Emphasis added.) The disjunctive ``or'' in the statutory language, which twice separatesthe word ``automobile'' from the expression ``no-fault insurance'', indicatesthat Congress intended that the term ``no fault insurance'' encompass anytype of insurance payments made without regard to who may have been responsiblefor the injury, not just automobile no-fault insurance. <T3>Comment: </T3>A commenter believes that andSection; 411.53(a) shouldbe amended to exclude from Medicare coverage cases when a no-fault insurerhas made only a partial payment. It would then be possible for providersto collect their full charges. The commenter stated that certain no-faultinsurers are denying full payment alleging that hospitals are entitledto receive no more than the Medicare DRG payment for Medicare beneficiarieswho are involved in automobile accidents, even though the no-fault insureris billed. The commenter proposes to remedy this situation by having thefinal regulations state that when a no-fault insurer makes only a partialpayment, the services should be excluded from Medicare coverage. This wouldallow the provider to be able to enforce collection of the amount due thatexceeds the Medicare DRG payment. <T3>Response: </T3>Under section 1862(b) of the Act, responsibility forpayment for Medicare covered services is shifted from Medicare to certainthird party insurers. The fact that Medicare is not the primary payer doesnot affect the status of the services as covered services under the Medicarelaw. Section 1862(b) is a nonpayment rather than a noncoverage provision.Thus, when a private insurer is a primary payer, Medicare may still beobligated to pay secondary benefits up to the DRG amount in accordancewith the law. To amend Medicare regulations as the commenter wishes wouldbe contrary to the law. However, we have included a new section 411.31entitled, ``Authority to bill third party payers for full charges'', whichstates that providers may bill third party payers (except liability insurers)and expect their full charges to be paid, unless this would specificallycontravene a law or an agreement with the insurer. There is no action that HCFA can take to force a third party payer to payin excess of the DRG amount. However, if a third party payer pays the DRGamount when charges exceed the DRG, but pays charges when the DRG is greater,a provider may have a basis for prevailing on a third party payer to changeits method of reimbursement. This could be accomplished either throughthe Office of the State Insurance Commissioner (or other appropriate Stateauthority) or through the courts. <T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter proposed that the provision for Medicareconditional payments when the workers' compensation or no-fault paymentwill not be made promptly (andSection;andSection; 411.45 and 411.53) be modifiedto include HMOs, health and medical care corporations, commercial healthinsurance, Taft-Hartley Plans, and other self-funded arrangements. Thebasis for the suggestion is that all these carriers and employers havean obligation to assume liability for payment. <T3>Response: </T3>We do not agree that these classes of possible thirdparty payers should be mentioned since payments made by them as a classmay not always be primary to Medicare. To the extent that individual payersare primary to Medicare, they are already included in the provision. Furthermore,it would not be correct to say that conditional payments may be made whenan <T3>employer plan</T3> does not pay promptly. Section 1862(b)(1) of theMedicare law states that when workers' compensation or no-fault insurancedoes not pay promptly, Medicare may pay conditional benefits. The provisionsdealing with employer group health plans (sections 1862(b) (2) and (3))do not include the term ``promptly''. If these payers were included asa class, it would appear to create this improper result.<ITAG tagnum="81">G. To Clarify Policies on Liability Insurance </ITAG>1. <T3>Background. </T3>With respect to liability insurance, current rules_a.

In defining terms, under andSection; 405.322_ (1) Included self-insured plans within the definition of liability insurance;(2) Included, within the definition of ``self-insured plan'', a statementthat it is a plan under which an entity is ``authorized by State law tocarry its own risk''; (3) Did not specify that, for purposes of the Medicare Act, payments underthe Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) are a type of liability payment undera self-insured plan; and (4) Did not specify that payments made by an insured party to cover deductiblesimposed by the liability insurance policy are considered to be liabilityinsurance payments. c. Did not clearly state that a provider has no right to charge a liabilityinsurer or a beneficiary who has received a liability insurance payment;d. Provided that Medicare will make a conditional payment if the beneficiaryhas filed or has a right to file a liability claim; and e. Did not specifically include underinsured motorist insurance (exceptas a type of uninsured motorist insurance) in the definition of liabilityinsurance. In the situation noted under the above paragraph a, HCFA was paying forservices covered by liability insurance, with no opportunity to recoverfrom the insurer. The omissions from the definitions aggravated the problem.As explained in the preamble to the NPRM, providers should not be permittedto bill a liability insurer or to place a lien against a liability settlementfor the following reasons: andbullet; With respect to Medicare covered services, sections 1866(a) and1842(b)(3)(8)(ii) of the Act permit providers, and suppliers who have acceptedassignment, to bill the beneficiary only for applicable deductible andcoinsurance amounts. andbullet; Services for which liability insurance payments have been madeor can reasonably be expected do not lose their identity as covered services.Since the amounts a beneficiary receives or is due to receive from a liabilityinsurer are his or her own funds, billing the liability insurer or thebeneficiary or filing a lien against the settlement would violate the statutoryprohibition. andbullet; In the case of liability insurance, the provider or supplier hasno standing to sue or send a bill to the insurer. Since only the beneficiary_notthe provider or supplier_has a right to sue the liability insurer, a billto the liability insurer or a lien against the settlement would, in effect,be a bill to the beneficiary. andbullet; Bills to liability insurers or beneficiaries or liens againstliability settlements, if effectuated, reduce the beneficiary's recoveryfrom the insurer unduly, since liability payments include compensationfor damages other than medical expenses. The restriction does not apply to providers and suppliers that furnishservices to individuals enrolled_ andbullet; In a health maintenance organization (HMO) or a competitive medicalplan (CMP) that has a contract with the Secretary under section 1876 ofthe Act; or andbullet; In a health care prepaid plan (HCPP) that is paid in accordancewith section 1833(a)(1)(A) of the Act.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">(The rules applicable to HMOs and CMPs are set forth in andSection;417.528 of the Medicare regulations, and those rules, through cross-referencesin Subpart D of Part 417, are made applicable to HCPPs.) Although it is necessary to limit provider charges, we believe that, becauseof HCFA's clarified recovery rights, no limitations need be placed on makingMedicare conditional payments in liability insurance cases. 2. Proposal. In the NPRM, we proposed to make the following changes: a. In andSection; 411.50(b), to_ (1) Expand the definition of ``liability insurance payment'' to includeout-of-pocket payments by entities that carry liability insurance, includingpayments by the insured party to cover deductibles required by the liabilitypolicy; and (2) Revise the definition of ``self-insured plan'' to include the FTCAand to remove the statement ``authorized by State law''. b. Under andSection; 411.54, to specify that providers, and suppliers whohave accepted assignment, are precluded from billing liability insurers,from billing beneficiaries who have received liability insurance payments,and from filing liens against liability settlements. c. In andSection; 411.52, to specify that a conditional payment may be madewhen Medicare benefits are claimed for treatment of an injury or illnessallegedly caused by another party.d. In andSection; 411.50(b), to clarify the definition of ``liability insurance''by specifying that underinsured motorist insurance is an example of liabilityinsurance. 3. <T3>Comments and responses. </T3><T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters believe that the MSP statutory provisionsallow hospitals to recoup, from a beneficiary's liability recovery, upto the full amount of the hospital's charges, even though the lower prospectivepayment system (PPS) amount would constitute payment in full if the serviceswere paid for by Medicare. The commenters believe that Medicare programinstructions and the proposed conforming regulations are unconstitutionaland invalid in limiting hospitals to the PPS amount. The commenters alsobelieve that the regulations are contrary to the statute (andSection; 1862(b)(1)),which they assert excludes from Medicare coverage any services for whichpayment has been made or can reasonably be expected to be made promptlyunder liability insurance. <T3>Response: </T3>Allowing hospitals to file liens and bill liabilityinsurers for the hospitals' full charges (rather than billing Medicare)would violate the participating hospitals' commitment not to bill Medicarebeneficiaries for covered services. As noted above_ andbullet; Services that are payable under liability insurance are stillMedicare covered services; and andbullet; Allowing hospitals to file liens and to bill liability insurersfor their full charges could result in out-of-pocket losses for beneficiaries.If the hospital's charges were more than the liability insurance payment,the hospital could take the beneficiary's entire recovery. <T3>Comment: </T3>A commenter questioned whether or not andSection; 411.54of the proposed regulations, which prohibits hospitals from billing liabilityinsurance, applies to hospitals affiliated with health maintenance organizations(HMOs) and health care prepayment plans (HCPPs). <T3>Response: </T3>As noted above, andSection; 417.528 of the current Medicarerules applies to HMOs with contracts under section 1876 of the Act whetherpaid on a cost or capitation basis and to HCPPs. HMOs are permitted tobill liability insurance because the statute explicitly instructs themto do so. HCPPs, although paid under section 1833(a)(1)(A) of the Act,are subject to the same rules as HMOs as provided in andSection; 417.802of the Medicare regulations. In these final rules, andSection; 411.54(d)(2)is revised to reflect this policy. <T3>Comment: </T3>A commenter asked if the standard provider agreementwill be modified to recognize that HMO-affiliated hospitals that treatbeneficiaries enrolled under a risk-basis contract are permitted, underandSection; 417.528(b) to bill liability insurers. <T3>Response: </T3>HMO affiliated hospitals do not bill on behalf of theHMO. HMOs do their own billing, and may bill liability insurers under andSection;417.528(b). There is no need to modify the provider agreement. <T3>Comment: </T3>An organization that enrolls some Medicare beneficiariesunder a risk-basis HMO contract with Medicare and also enrolls other Medicarebeneficiaries under an HCPP arrangement asked whether for the beneficiariesunder a risk-basis HMO contract it could charge a liability insurer onthe basis of hospital charges or was limited to the Medicare DRG amount.<T3>Response: </T3>Section 417.528(b) authorizes an HMO to ``charge theinsurance carrier, employer, or other entity * * * or the Medicare enrollee.* * *'' This regulation does not specify the basis for the charge becausethe law does not authorize HCFA to require a particular billing methodor basis (The law provides that HMOs are to charge ``in accordance withthe charges allowed under such law or policy'', but makes no mention ofthe Medicare DRG amount.) We expect an HMO to use a uniform method andbasis for billing all enrollees. <T3>Comment: </T3>Since HCFA pays HCPPs on an aggregate cost (rather thanservice-by-service) basis, the commenter asked how the Medicare carriercan determine how much to recover from a liability insurer for Part B servicesfor which the HCPP is not allowed to bill the liability insurer. The commenterargued that the HCPP should be permitted to bill the liability insurerfor Part B services, and include as an offset on its cost report, any sumsthus obtained from the insurer. <T3>Response: </T3>As noted above, we have revised andSection; 411.54 topermit HCPPs to bill liability insurers just as HMOs and CMPs with contractsunder section 1876 of the Act. <T3>Comment: </T3>The commenter asked whether (in cases involving liabilityinsurance) a hospital that must bill Medicare and accept the DRG paymentamount, must comply with a beneficiary's request for a statement of billedcharges rather than the DRG amount.<T3>Response: </T3>It is common practice (and may be required under Statelaw) for hospitals to furnish patients with a statement of billed chargeseven though the hospital may have been paid less by a third party, forexample, because of a discount agreed to by the hospital with an insurer,or under a State program. There is no reason to treat a Medicare beneficiary'srequest differently. We believe that any patient has a right to know the charges for the serviceshe or she received. Moreover, hospital charges are the standard measureof damages applied in tort recovery actions that involve liability insurance.A patient who is denied information on the amount of the hospital chargeswould find it very difficult to prove the nature and extent of his or herinjuries. Accordingly, we have added this requirement at andSection; 411.54.<T3>Comment: </T3>The commenter is not clear as to whether or not the proposedregulations, particularly the prohibition against billing liability insurance(andSection;andSection; 411.54(c) and 489.20(g)), apply to outpatient hospitaland physician services. <T3>Response: </T3>The regulations state that they apply to providers ofservices and suppliers. We generally define terms at the beginning of theCode of Federal Regulations that applies to the Medicare and Medicaid programs(andSection;andSection; 400.200 through 400.203). In andSection; 400.202, theterm ``provider'' is defined as including entities that furnish outpatienthospital services; the term ``supplier'' is defined as including physicians.The meaning of these terms is the same throughout the regulations, unlesssome other meaning is stated. The term ``Medicare payment'' used here meanspayment for any type of covered service, including hospital outpatientservices.<T3>Comment:</T3> The commenter believes that the regulations should makeclear whether Medicare is the primary payer when the person presumed tohave caused the injury has no liability insurance.<T3>Response:</T3> We agree that clarification is needed. We have modifiedthe definition of ``self-insured plan'' in section 411.50(b) so that itdoes not imply that self-insured plans are <T3>limited</T3> to entities that engage in a business, trade or profession.The revised definition cites such entities, along with nonprofit organizations,as examples of entities that may have self-insured plans. We note thatthe mere absence of insurance purchased from a carrier does not necessarilyconstitute a ``plan'' of self-insurance. If HCFA determines that the absenceof insurance purchased from a carrier does not constitute a ``self-insuredplan'' in a particular case, HCFA will not attempt to recover its paymentsfrom the entity that lacks insurance coverage. Section 411.50(b) also defines``liability insurance payment'' as including ``out-of pocket payments''and payments made under a self insured plan. Under these definitions, paymentsmade by the self-insured individual or entity are primary to Medicare.<T3>Comment:</T3> The commenter questioned if a provider that has beenpaid part of its charges by a no fault automobile insurer can bill Medicarefor its regular DRG payment when liability insurance may also be availablebut cannot be billed because of the prohibition against billing liabilityinsurance. The commenter believes that permitting the provider to billfor the entire DRG payment would not adversely affect the amount of thesettlement or judgment the beneficiary would otherwise receive. <T3>Response:</T3> Sections 411.32 and 411.33(e) make clear that when aprovider has received a portion of its charges from a third party payer,that provider may bill Medicare only for secondary payment. Although thecommenter's suggestion would not, it is true, disadvantage the beneficiaryseeking a liability payment, it would be inconsistent with the statutoryprovisions which require that Medicare pay only to the extent that paymenthas not been made by the third party. Thus, Medicare may make only a secondarypayment. <T3>Comment: </T3>Several hospitals commented that being paid by Medicarean amount based on a DRG rather than their charges shortchanges them. Theyconsider that, since liability insurers pay all the beneficiary's accident-relatedmedical expenses based either on charges or on what Medicare has paid,payment of the DRG amount either enriches the beneficiary or saves theinsurer money. Further, the commenters believe that limiting hospitalsto the PPS amount would cause financial hardship, because the cost of treatingthe traumatic injuries typical in liability insurance cases is much greaterthan the amount allowed under Medicare PPS. The commenters suggest thatthey be permitted to collect their full charges from liability insurance.<T3>Response: </T3>HCFA's policy of requiring providers to bill Medicarein liability insurance situations reflects Congressional intent. The legislativehistory of section 1862(b)(1) of the Act states that Medicare would ``payfor the beneficiary's care in the usual manner and then seek reimbursementfrom the private insurance carrier after, and to the extent that, suchcarrier's liability under the private policy for the services has beendetermined''. H.R. Rep. No. 96-1167, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 389 (1980). TheSenate history reflects similar intentions. Staff of the Senate Committeeon Finance, 96th Congress 2d Session, <T3>Spending Reductions: Recommendations of the Committee on Finance Requiredby the Reconciliation Process in Section 3(a)(15) of H. Con. Res. 307,the First Budget Resolution for Fiscal Year 1981</T3> 42 (Committee Print1980). Additionally, there are programatic reasons for HCFA's policy. Payment of full charges would enable hospitals to profit at the expenseof Medicare beneficiaries. Hospitals are allowed to collect their chargeswhen insurance other than liability is primary under the MSP provisionsbecause that procedure does not disadvantage beneficiaries. Insurers otherthan liability pay according to the terms of the coverage <T3>for which the beneficiary has contracted.</T3> The amounts paid arefor express losses such as medical expenses, lost wages, etc. When a hospitalcollects from such insurers, it is <T3>not </T3>collecting from the beneficiary's personal funds. Liabilityinsurance is different. It is not a contractual arrangement between a beneficiaryand an insurer; it is a contractual arrangement between a policyholder(i.e., the tortfeasor) and an insurer, which is intended to protect the<T3>policyholder</T3> from potential financial loss resulting from a tortfor which he or she is responsible. As noted above, and in the preambleto the proposed rule, a provider or supplier has no standing to sue orsend a bill to the insurer. Since only the beneficiary (i.e., the injuredparty)_not the provider or supplier_ has a right to sue the liability insurer,collecting from a beneficiary's liability insurance settlement is tantamountto collecting from the beneficiary's personal funds.Moreover, liability insurance is unlike other insurances which specifythe amounts or percentages payable for various medical procedures and whetheror not such procedures are covered by the insurer. Liability insurancegenerally provides a lump sum coverage amount for all liability, includingany unspecified medical damages. Thus, in liability insurance contextsall allocations are subject to negotiation or court order. If more is paidfor medical expenses, the insurer will try to pay less for other lossesor to compensate the injured party less for intangibles like pain and suffering,which never apply in non-liability insurance contexts. When the amount of liability insurance is small in relation to the amountof a hospital's charges because the limits of the policy are low, or becausethe insurer offers a small amount to settle a case of questionable liability,the hospital may collect the entire liability payment remaining after paymentof the beneficiary's attorney's fees. That would leave the beneficiarynothing for pain and suffering, etc., and could leave Medicare liable forthe beneficiary's other covered medical expenses. HCFA's policy, therefore, does not serve to enrich beneficiaries at theexpense of hospitals. Rather, it protects beneficiaries from being disadvantagedin liability insurance cases. HCFA's policy does not save liability insurersmoney, since their payments are generally based on the injured person'smedical <T3>bills, </T3>not on amounts paid by the person's insurers, includingMedicare, which may be less than the billed amounts. In many States, evidenceof insurance is not admissible in tort actions, or is admitted only forlimited purposes. In addition, under the commonly applicable ``collateralsource'' rule, insurance that may cover medical expenses collateral tothe defendant's obligation to pay, such as disability or health insurance,is not considered in determining amounts a person receives from the defendant.Furthermore, the Medicare statute establishes the methodology to be usedin paying for hospital services. When hospitals are paid in accordancewith that methodology, they are getting amounts which, on average, reflectthe cost of furnishing services economically and efficiently. They arenot getting less than Congress mandated. While they may get less than theircharges in a particular case, in other cases they may get more. <T3>Comment: </T3>A commenter believes that existing regulations (andSection;405.324(a)(3)(ii)) clearly recognize that hospitals would be permittedto collect liability insurance for services to Medicare patients. <T3>Response: </T3>Section 405.324(a)(3)(ii) recognizes that hospitalsmight collect from liability insurers. However, that regulation works inthe context of the whole body of regulations and the statute itself. Otherregulations make clear that the Medicare beneficiary is to be protectedfrom having to pay anything for covered services except certain specifiedamounts. The overriding principle is that the beneficiary is to be no worseoff because of a particular provision than without it. That is why hospitalswere once permitted to bill <T3>willing </T3>liability insurers. This was expected to occur after arelatively minor injury when the responsible party was anxious to settlethe matter and the beneficiary asked for little more than that his medicalcare be paid for by the responsible party or its insurer. Hospitals were never authorized to file liens against potential liabilitypayments. Liens, by their very nature, smack of compulsion, rather thanvolition. When it came to HCFA's attention that hospitals were filing liens,and in light of 1984 changes in the statute making it clear that Medicarepayment could be denied only if a liability insurance payment could beexpected to be made <T3>promptly, </T3>the policy was changed to prohibit hospitals from billingliability insurers in any case. For the following reasons, the clarifiedand revised policy is the only one in keeping with the letter and spiritof current law: 1. Only rarely can liability insurance be expected to pay ``promptly''.2. Hospitals had misused their option to bill ``willing'' liability insurersby_ andbullet; Billing when the beneficiary had filed suit and liability wasbeing disputed; and andbullet; Filing liens. The prohibition against billing liability insurers will apply nationwideexcept in the State of Oregon. In <T3>Oregon Association of Hospitals et. al. </T3>v. <T3>Sullivan </T3>(Case No. CV 88-625 FR), the United States District Courtfor the District of Oregon has ruled that hospitals have the right ``torecover up to their total charges from a liability insurer that is a primarypayer and can reasonably be expected to pay promptly''. HCFA is appealingthis ruling. However, while HCFA's appeal is proceeding, HCFA will complywith the court's ruling in the State of Oregon. Accordingly, unless theruling is reversed on appeal, or overturned by a statutory clarification,a special rule applies. In Oregon, hospitals may, as an alternative tobilling Medicare, collect up to their full charges from a liability insurerthat pays ``promptly''. For general purposes, andSection; 411.21 defines``promptly'' with respect to third party payments as payment made within120 days after receipt of a claim. For the special Oregon situation, withrespect to liability insurers, andSection; 411.50 defines ``prompt'' paymentas payment within 120 days from the earlier of the following: andbullet; The date a claim, or lien against a potential liability settlement,is filed. andbullet; The date a service was furnished, or, in the case of inpatienthospital services, the date of discharge. If the liability insurer does not pay within the applicable 120-day period,the hospital may not collect from the liability insurer because the paymentcannot ``reasonably be expected to be made promptly''. In such case, thehospital must withdraw its claim or its lien against a potential liabilitysettlement, or be subject to HCFA sanctions, such as termination of itsright to participate in the Medicare program. Sections 411.54(d) and 489.20(g)of the proposed rules are revised to reflect application in the State ofOregon. <ITAG tagnum="81">H. To Provide Uniform Rules for Computing the Amount of Medicare SecondaryPayment, and to Limit Charges When a Proper Claim Is Not Filed </ITAG>1. <T3>Background.</T3> Under previous rules applicable to employer grouphealth plans_a. The Medicare secondary payment was computed on the basis of the amountof the third party payment, without reference to situations in which thelatter was reduced because of failure to file a proper claim. b. For services paid on a reasonable charge basis, the methods for computingthe Medicare secondary payment differed in a way that could result in lowerpayments for assigned than for unassigned claims. c. For services paid on other than a reasonable charge basis, the Medicaresecondary payment was computed on the basis of the Medicare payment rate,which could be more than the charges. In the situation noted under the above paragraph a, we believe that providersand suppliers, and beneficiaries who are not physically or mentally incapacitated,are responsible for filing proper claims and for any third party paymentreduction that results from their failure to file proper claims. Therefore_andbullet; Medicare should not have to increase its secondary payment whenthe primary insurer pays less because a proper claim was not filed; andandbullet; The beneficiary should not be subject to higher charges becausethe provider or supplier fails to file a proper claim. In the situations noted in paragraphs b. and c. above, we believe that_andbullet; Lower payments for assigned claims are unfair and could discourageacceptance of assignment, which is desirable for beneficiaries; and andbullet; The law intends that Medicare supplement the amount paid by theprimary payer only in an amount that, combined with the primary payment,equals the charges for the services, or the amount the provider or supplieris obligated to accept as full payment. (When a provider or supplier isobligated to accept as full payment an amount less than its charges, HCFAconsiders that lower amount to be the provider's or supplier's charges.)2. <T3>Proposal. </T3>To deal with the problems noted above, we proposed that_a. When a primary insurer pays less because a proper claim was not filed_(1) The Medicare secondary payment will be no greater than it would havebeen if the primary insurer had paid on the basis of a proper claim; and(2) A provider may charge Medicare and the beneficiary no more than itwould be entitled to charge if it had filed a proper claim (andSection;andSection;411.32(c) and 489.20(i)). b. For services paid for on a reasonable charge basis (or on a monthlycapitation basis that is now used for certain ESRD services), the computationmethod is the same for assigned as for unassigned claims (andSection; 411.33).c. For services paid on other than a reasonable charge basis, a revisedformula ensures that the Medicare secondary payments are not greater thanthe excess of the charges over the primary payments (andSection; 411.33(e)).3. <T3>Comments and responses. </T3><T3>Comment: </T3>Two commenters objected to andSection; 411.33(e), whichaddresses the amount of Medicare secondary payment for providers paid ona basis other than reasonable charge or capitation. They believe that itdoes not take into account the legislative provisions for provider paymentunder PPS. The commenters believe that the proposal limits payment to theprovider's charges even when the PPS payment may exceed charges. The commentersbelieve that this provision is contrary to the PPS provisions, which providepayment based on a DRG, in that it permits HCFA to ignore the PPS rateand limit the combined third party payment and Medicare secondary paymentto the provider's charges. The commenters suggested that the Medicare secondarypayment be calculated by subtracting the third party payment from the grossamount payable by Medicare. <T3>Response: </T3>As was pointed out in the Notice of Proposed Rulemakingpublished on June 15, 1988 (53 FR 22340), andSection; 1862(b)(3)(B) of theAct permits Medicare secondary payments only if the employer group healthplan pays less than the charges. We therefore feel that the intent of thelaw is for Medicare to supplement the amount paid by a primary payer upto the provider's charges. If HCFA were to base Medicare secondary paymenton a PPS amount that is greater than the charges, HCFA's secondary paymentpolicy would be anomalous. For instance, if a provider charged $10,000for services for which the Medicare PPS rate is $18,000, and the primarypayer paid $10,000, Medicare would make no payment, since the statute doesnot permit Medicare secondary payments where a third party payer pays thecharges in full. Yet, if the third party payer paid one dollar less thanthe charges ($9,999), Medicare would have to pay $8,001 (the differencebetween the $18,000 PPS amount and the $9,999 paid by the third party payer).We have chosen a policy that does not lead to this anomalous result.<ITAG tagnum="81">I. To Clarify Interpretation of the Working Aged Provisions. </ITAG>1. <T3>Background.</T3> Previous rules_ a. Did not specify what is meant by ``employed''. b. Did not clearly interpret how the statutory language ``by reason ofsuch employment'' applies in the case of reemployed retirees and annuitants.c. Did not specify that employer group health plans include ``employee-pay-all''plans. d. Made Medicare primary for members of a multiemployer plan whom the planidentifies as employees of employers of fewer than 20 employees (andSection;405.340(b)(1)(ii)). e. Provided (in andSection; 405.341(d)) that an individual who was receivingemployer disability payments was not considered to be employed if thatindividual was not receiving remuneration subject to taxation under theFederal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA), or before attaining age 65,was entitled to disability benefits under title II of the Act. f. Provided (in andSection; 405.341(c)(2)) that Medicare would pay primarybenefits for Medicare-covered services that were not covered under theemployer plan; and could make a Medicare conditional payment when employerplan payment was denied ``for any reason'' (andSection; 405.344(a)). We considered it necessary to_ andbullet; Correct the omissions noted under paragraphs a through c above;andbullet; Eliminate the exemption under the above paragraph d, for consistencywith more recent legislation on large group health plan coverage of disabledactive individuals (which does not exempt employees of employers of lessthan 100 employees in a multiemployer plan); andbullet; Apply to the working aged the principle established by that samelegislation, that ``disabled'' individuals may be considered ``employed'';and andbullet; Establish more reasonable limits with respect to the provisionsnoted under the above paragraph f. 2. <T3>Proposal.</T3> In the NPRM, we proposed to_ a. Make clear that the Medicare working aged provisions apply not onlyto employees but also to the self-employed, such as owners of businessesor independent contractors, and to members of the clergy and of religiousbodies (andSection; 411.70(d)). b. Make clear that a reemployed annuitant or retiree who is covered byan employer group health plan is considered covered ``by reason of employment'',even if_ (1) The plan is the same plan that previously provided coverage to thatindividual when he was a retiree or annuitant; or (2) The premiums for the plan are paid from a retirement pension or fund(andSection; 411.72(c)). c. Modify the definition of ``employer group health plan'' to make clearthat it includes plans under the auspices of employers that make no financialcontribution, the so-called ``employee-pay-all'' plans. d. Remove from the definition of ``employer group health plan'' (andSection;411.70(d)), the statement that a multiemployer plan does not have to payprimary benefits for individuals whom it can identify as employed by employersof less than 20 employees. (This requirement previously appeared in andSection;405.340(b)(1).) e. Specify that, effective July 17, 1987, individuals who receive employerdisability payments that are subject to taxation under FICA are consideredemployed (for purposes of the working aged provisions), even if they receivedsocial security disability benefits before attaining age 65. (July 17,1987 is the effective date of HCFA general instructions issued under section9319 of Pub. L. 100-203.) f. Make clear, in andSection; 411.75, the circumstances under which HCFAdoes or does not make Medicare primary payments and conditional primarypayments. 3. <T3>Comments and responses. </T3><T3>Comment: </T3>Fourteen commenters opposed defining ``employed'' toinclude members of the clergy and religious orders who are paid for theirservices by a religious body or other entity. Most commenters stressedthe disproportionate harmful effect on members of religious communitiesand the insufficiency of funds to pay for their medical expenses. Theyalso considered that there is no statutory authority for the definition.They noted that the status of the clergy is not specifically addressedin section 1862(b)(3), and expressed their belief that section 210(a)(8)(A)of the Social Security Act (which defines the term ``employment'' for socialsecurity coverage purposes) specifically excludes the services of membersof the clergy and religious orders from the term ``employment''. <T3>Response: </T3>For purposes of 1862(b)(3) of the Act, the term ``employed''includes not only employees, but self-employed persons such as directorsof corporations and owners of businesses, as well as individuals who areengaged in ``employment'' as defined in section 210(a) of the Act. Contraryto the commenters' belief, section 210(a)(8) of the Act provides that,for social security purposes, the term ``employment'' includes serviceperformed by members of the clergy and religious orders if an electionof coverage under section 3121 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 isin effect. It is precisely because of this provision that members of electingorders qualify for Medicare benefits. It would be entirely inconsistentwith the statute to hold that the very employment which qualifies a personfor Medicare benefits is not employment for purposes of determining thatMedicare is secondary payer with respect to that person's group healthplan. As with other workers covered under section 1862(b)(3) of the Act,when a member of the clergy or a religious order retires, Medicare becomesprimary payer and the employer group health plan may make secondary payments.We have revised the proposed definition of ``employed'' to make clear thata member of a religious order is considered employed only if the religiousorder pays FICA taxes on behalf of the member.<T3>Comment: </T3>Two commenters objected to including the self-employedwithin the definition of the term ``employed.'' They expressed the viewthat self-employed individuals do not receive pay from employers and thereforeshould not be considered ``employed.'' They asked which self-employed individualsare included in the definition of employed and whether employers must offerEGHP coverage to all individuals age 65 and over who are self-employed.<T3>Response: </T3>There is nothing in section 1862(b)(3) of the Act thatlimits its application to ``employees.'' This statutory provision requiresthat the individual be ``employed'' and have the group health coverage``by reason of such employment''. This includes self-employment activitythat is related to the entity that provides the group health coverage.Under this provision, Medicare is secondary to employer group health plancoverage provided to a self-employed individual because of his or her self-employmentactivity. Although employers are not required to provide group health plancoverage to self-employed individuals, many of them do. If an employerchooses to provide coverage to self-employed individuals who are also Medicarebeneficiaries, that coverage is primary to Medicare. Self-employed persons pay taxes on self-employment income under the Self-EmploymentContributions Act of 1954 and on that basis receive social security quartersof coverage for purposes of qualifying for social security benefits. Oncethey have earned the required quarters of coverage they are treated thesame as employees for benefits under the Act, including Medicare. It wouldbe inconsistent to hold that employment which counts toward Medicare entitlementunder Title II of the Social Security Act does not count as employmentfor purposes of the ``working aged'' secondary payer provision under titleXVIII of the Act. However, we recognize that section 211(b)(2) of the Actcurrently defines the term ``self-employment income'' for social securitycoverage as net earnings from self-employment of $400 or more. We believethat a person should not be considered self-employed for purposes of the``working aged'' provision if his earnings from self-employment are lessthan the amount specified in section 211(b)(2). Therefore, we have revisedthe proposed definition of ``employed'' in section 411.70 to provide thata self-employed individual is considered employed for Medicare secondarypayer purposes during a particular tax year only if, during the precedingtax year, the individual's net earnings from self-employment activity relatedto the entity that offers the group health coverage, equals or exceedsthe amount specified in section 211(b)(2) of the Act. The second part of the question relates to the Age Discrimination in EmploymentAct (ADEA). This Act requires employers to offer health coverage underthe same terms and conditions to older and younger employees. Since theADEA uses the term ``employee'', it does not apply to the self-employed.<T3>Comment: </T3>Two commenters requested revision of section 411.72 toclarify that a reemployed individual who is a retiree or annuitant is coveredby an employer group health plan ``by reason of employment'' only if theindividual would be covered by the employer group health plan if he werea currently working nonretired person. <T3>Response: </T3>We are clarifying the term ``by reason of employment''in section 411.72. The employer must offer the same coverage to activelyworking former retirees and annuitants as is offered actively working non-retiredindividuals. If the employer does not offer group health coverage to aparticular category of non-retired employee, e.g., employees hired on acontingency basis only, then the employer is not required to offer grouphealth coverage to a former retiree who works on a contingency basis only.Coverage provided to such individuals is not considered coverage ``by reasonof employment,'' and therefore may be secondary to Medicare. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter pointed out that employers and temporaryemployees have difficulties in adjusting to changes in Medicare's statusas primary or secondary when retirees return to work on a temporary basis.Retirees may be discouraged from taking temporary jobs, particularly ifthey have to pay all or a portion of the premiums for insurance providedthrough their employers (which is primary to Medicare) instead of lowerpremiums for their retirement-based health insurance (which is secondaryto Medicare). The commenter suggests that once an employee retires andMedicare becomes the primary payer, Medicare continue as primary untilthe retiree has been reemployed for at least 12 months. <T3>Response: </T3>The law requires Medicare to be secondary payer wheneveran individual has group health plan coverage ``by reason of employment''.The term ``by reason of employment'' applies to periods of temporary employment,and thus precludes Medicare from making primary payments during any period(no matter how brief) in which the individual is covered by the employerplan ``by reason of employment''. We recognize that there may be administrativedifficulties in processing some claims when Medicare status changes fromprimary to secondary and back again. HCFA has instituted significant improvementsin its data collection system to facilitate processing of claims in whichthird party payers are involved.<T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters objected to our proposed removal ofthe provision that makes Medicare primary payer for enrollees of a multiemployerplan whom the plan can identify as employed by employers of fewer than20 employees. Some of those commenters thought that we proposed to makethis change retroactive to January 1, 1983, and were particularly concernedabout the impact of this retroactive change on health resources, as HCFAmoved to recoup Medicare primary payments made in those circumstances.They also noted that neither the statute nor the legislative history authorizedthe proposed change. Congress stipulated that the working aged provisionsdid not apply to employers of fewer than 20 employees and did not qualifythis exemption for employers that use a multiemployer plan. <T3>Response: </T3>We did not intend to make the change retroactive andhave decided not to make the change. In andSection; 411.72 of the final rulewe have restored the provision that we proposed to remove. Our decisionwas based on the above comments and also on_ andbullet; Comments from the religious community and others expressing concernabout the disproportionate impact on small employers; and andbullet; An opinion expressed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commissionin its Notice N-915-026 of May 12, 1988, that section 4(g) of the Age Discriminationin Employment Act (ADEA) does not require employers of fewer than 20 employeeswho participate in a multiemployer plan to provide the same health insurancecoverage under the same circumstances to older and younger employees. Sincesection 4(g) of the ADEA was enacted primarily to serve as an enforcementmechanism for the working aged provision, the two provisions should beinterpreted as consistently as possible. <ITAG tagnum="81">J. To Provide Uniform Rules for Determination of the Amount of MedicareRecovery from a Party that has Incurred Costs to Obtain a Judgment or Settlementthat Resulted in a Third Party Payment </ITAG>1. <T3>Background. </T3>Under andSection; 405.324(b) of the previous rules,when a beneficiary received a liability insurance payment as a result ofa judgment or settlement, Medicare reduced its recovery to account forthe procurement costs, that is, costs such as attorney fees that the beneficiaryincurred in order to obtain the judgment or settlement. Although procurement costs are generally incurred by a beneficiary in connectionwith liability insurance, occasionally they may be incurred by anotherparty or in connection with other types of insurance that are primary toMedicare. We believe that, as a matter of equity, procurement costs should also beconsidered when another party has incurred such costs and when the judgmentor settlement is obtained under other types of insurance primary to Medicare.However, there need to be some exceptions and limitations. HCFA shouldnot allow for procurement costs that do not reduce the amount of a judgmentor settlement payment that is actually available to the party. This isthe case, for instance, under the many workers' compensation laws thatprovide separate awards for attorney fees. Furthermore, there should be a special rule for a situation in which HCFAitself incurs procurement costs, for example, when the government mustfile suit because the party that received payment opposes HCFA's recovery.2. <T3>Proposal. </T3>We proposed to broaden the current rules, as noted underthe above discussion and include them in Subpart B, which is of generalapplicability, as a new andSection; 411.37 that specifies the amounts ofMedicare recovery under different circumstances: a. If the Medicare payment is less than the judgment or settlement payment,HCFA would share proportionately in the party's procurement costs. b. If Medicare payment equals or exceeds the judgment or settlement payments,HCFA would recover only the amount that remains after subtracting the party'stotal procurement costs. c. If HCFA incurs procurement costs of its own because the party that receivedpayment opposes HCFA's recovery, the recovery amount would be the lowerof the following: (1) The Medicare payment. (2) The total judgment or settlement amount, minus the party's total procurementcosts. 3. <T3>Comments and responses. </T3>We received no comments on these proposals.<ITAG tagnum="81">K. Clarifying Changes </ITAG>1. <T3>Proposal. </T3>Of the clarifying changes that were proposed in theNPRM, and are retained in the final rule, one elicited comment as shownbelow. a. In andSection; 411.6 (which excludes from Medicare payment services furnishedby a Federal provider), we added a paragraph (b)(4) to make clear thatservices of a Federal provider (for example, a Veterans Administration(VA) hospital) are not excluded if they are furnished under arrangementsmade by a participating hospital. This ensures that a participating hospitalcan secure for its patients necessary services that it cannot itself provide.b. Consistent with Departmental rules (45 CFR 30.15) and other HCFA rules(42 CFR 401.607), andSection; 411.24(d) makes clear that HCFA may recoverby offset against any monies it owes to the entity responsible for refundingthe Medicare conditional primary payment. c. In andSection; 411.35, we have clarified the limits on the amounts thata provider or supplier may charge the beneficiary (or someone on his orher behalf) when workers' compensation, no-fault insurance, or an employerplan is primary to Medicare.2. <T3>Comments and responses. </T3><T3>Comment: </T3>The commenter believes that current regulations giveveterans the impression that they must receive all care at a VA facility.Specifically, the commenter suggested that we revise andSection; 411.6 toindicate that veterans who choose not to use VA benefits are entitled touse their Medicare coverage; and andSection; 411.8 to make clear that veteransare entitled to primary Medicare benefits when the VA neither furnishesnor authorizes non-VA physicians or suppliers to furnish the services.<T3>Response: </T3>There is nothing in the regulations to suggest thatveterans entitled to receive care at a VA facility, or from private sourcesat VA expense, are not entitled to use Medicare instead. We believe thatthe concerns expressed by the commenter are more properly addressed throughadministrative processes rather than regulations. The Medicare contractormanuals and <T3>The Medicare Handbook </T3>clearly indicate that veterans have theoption to use either their Medicare or their VA entitlement. An individual'sentitlement to Medicare is not circumscribed because of eligibility underanother entitlement program. The Medicare contractor manuals clearly statethat an individual's entitlement to VA benefits is <T3>not </T3>a basis for denying a Medicare claim. <ITAG tagnum="81">L. Organization Change. </ITAG>In order to eliminate needless repetition, Subpart B of the new part 411sets forth those definitions and rules that apply equally to all or mostof the types of insurance that are primary to Medicare. These include definitionsof ``conditional payment'', ``secondary payment'', ``third party payment'',and ``proper claim'', the rules on recovery of conditional payments, andthe effect of third party payment on benefit utilization and deductibles.<ITAG tagnum="81">M. Other Changes. </ITAG>1. <T3>Definition of ``multiemployer plan''. </T3>It has been brought to ourattention that the health insurance industry distinguishes between ``multipleemployer plans''_which are sponsored by employers only, and ``multi-employerplans''_which are sponsored jointly by employers and unions. In andSection; 411.70(d), we have added a definition of ``multiemployer plan''specifying that it includes both of the kinds of plans identified above.2. <T3>Correction of an oversight: Indemnification of beneficiaries. </T3>Indeveloping the proposed rules published on June 15, 1988, we overlookedthe fact that section 4096 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of1987 amended section 1879(b) of the Social Security Act to change indemnificationpolicy. Under this policy, a beneficiary is indemnified for payments heor she made to a provider for services which the provider knew (but thebeneficiary did not know) were excluded from coverage as ``not reasonableand necessary'' or as custodial care. Before the section 4096 change, deductibleand coinsurance amounts were excluded from the indemnification amount.Under the amended law, the beneficiary is also indemnified for deductibleand coinsurance payments. We revised proposed andSection; 411.402 (which redesignates previous andSection;405.332) to conform it to the changes in the law. 3. <T3>Conforming changes required by the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Actof 1988 (MCCA) and the establishment of part 411. </T3>Subpart G of Part405 of the Medicare rules, which deals with beneficiary appeals under MedicarePart A, contains numerous references to ``posthospital'' SNF care, andto andSection; 405.310 (g) and (k). Conforming changes in the subpart arerequired because_andbullet; The MCCA removed the requirement that SNF care be for a conditionthat was previously treated in a hospital; andandbullet; Section 405.310 has been redesignated under the new part 411 asandSection; 411.15. We also took advantage of this opportunity to substitute lists of designateditems for some excessively long sentences and to provide paragraph headingsto guide the reader. 4. <T3>Additional clarifying change. </T3>We have added a new andSection; 411.32(a)(1)to make clear that Medicare benefits are secondary to benefits payableby entities that are primary to Medicare even when State law or the payerthat is primary to Medicare states that its benefits are secondary to Medicare'sor otherwise limits its payments to Medicare beneficiaries. This rule wasstated in andSection;andSection; 411.50(c)(2) and 411.62(a)(4) of the NPRM.Since this rule applies generally to Subparts C through F, it is beingplaced in Subpart B and replaces andSection;andSection; 411.50(c)(2) and 411.62(a)(4).<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Redesignation </ITAG>As part of the overall plan to reorganize the Medicare rules and provideadequate room for expansion, most of subpart C of part 405 is redesignatedunder a new part 411_Exclusions from Medicare, with a separate subpartfor each type of third party payer. A redesignation table is presentedat the end of this preamble to help the reader locate specific contentunder the new numbers. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Regulatory Impact Statement </ITAG>Executive Order (E.O.) 12291 requires us to prepare and publish regulatoryimpact analysis for any regulation that meets one of the E.O. criteriafor a ``major rule'', that is, a rule that is likely to result in: an annualeffect on the economy of $100 million or more; a major increase in costsor prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal, State or localgovernment agencies, or geographic regions; or significant adverse effectson competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or onthe ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-basedenterprises in domestic or export markets. In addition, we generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis thatis consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 through612), unless the Secretary certifies that a regulation will not have asignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.For the purposes of the RFA, we treat all providers and third party insurersas small entities. Also, section 1102(b) of the Social Security Act requiresthe Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis if this rule mayhave a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number ofsmall rural hospitals. Such an analysis must also conform to provisionsof section 604 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act,we define a small rural hospital as a hospital with fewer than 50 bedslocated outside a metropolitan statistical area.Many provisions of this rule either conform to recent statutory changesor reflect current HCFA operating policies as expressed in program instructionsand manuals. These regulatory provisions, of themselves, will not affectMedicare program expenditures. The other provisions of this rule will correctoverly narrow interpretations of existent statutory authority, extend statutoryprecedents applying to some third party payers to additional categoriesof payers, or clarify and increase the consistency of our MSP rules. Ofthese rule changes, we anticipate that all but one will have a negligibleimpact upon program expenditures. The change at andSection; 411.50(b), under which the definition of ``no faultinsurance'' is extended to include all types of no fault insurance, bringsour regulations into line with the intended scope of section 1862(b)(1)of the Act. The enacting legislation (section 953 of the Omnibus ReconciliationAct of 1980) clearly does not limit Medicare's secondary status to automobileno fault situations. However, previous regulations at andSection; 405.322(published on April 5, 1983 at 48 FR 14810) only partially implementedthe statute by making Medicare the secondary payer to automobile no faultmedical coverage only. We did not consider other forms of no fault liabilityinsurance. Because of this oversight, our intermediaries and carriers havebeen precluded from pursuing Trust Fund savings that would otherwise beavailable. This rule change allows us to maximize Trust Fund savings tothe extent permitted by law. While we cannot at this time produce a preciseestimate of the savings that will be achieved by this change, we expectthat the maximum available savings will fall significantly short of theE.O. 12291 thresholds specified above. We expect that implementation of these rule changes will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. For example,amending andSection; 489.20 to require certain additional commitments inall provider agreements serves largely to highlight the importance of identifyingMSP claims. Our intermediary and provider instructions already requirehospitals and other providers to systematically identify and, where appropriate,bill payers that are primary to Medicare first. Subsequent to the OIG study, discussed under ``Background'' above, we instituteda computerized cross reference system to identify claims that should havebeen billed to payers primary to Medicare. Once these payers are identifiedby the computer tracking system, the claims are referred back to the providerresponsible for initial billing. Under this system, Medicare no longerpays such bills automatically. This computerized cross reference system may eventually bring about someadministrative cost savings, to the extent that intermediaries may notbe required to process claims that providers properly charge to third partypayers. Providers may also reap several benefits once they take advantageof the fact that, in many circumstances, Medicare is the secondary payer.Current manuals instruct hospitals and other providers on how to identifypayers that are primary to Medicare. The marginal advantages for providerswould be savings on the administrative costs of billing Medicare, and additionalincome when the third party payer pays a higher rate than Medicare wouldnormally pay as primary payer. These benefits are already available toproviders under current instructions, and will not be altered by theseproposed rules. For these reasons, we have determined that a regulatory impact analysisis not required. Further, we have determined, and the Secretary certifies,that this final rule will not have significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities and will not have a significant impact on theoperations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. We have thereforenot prepared a regulatory flexibility analysis. <ITAG tagnum="84">V.

If the gross amountpayable by Medicare in this case is $2,700, then as secondary payer, Medicarepays the lowest of the following amounts:(i) The gross amount payable by Medicare minus the Medicare inpatient hospitaldeductible: $2,700^$520=$2,180.(ii) The gross amount payable by Medicare minus the third party payment:$2,700^$2,360=$340.(iii) The provider's charges minus the third party payment: $2,800^$2,360=$440.(iv) The provider's charges minus the Medicare deductible: $2,800^$520=$2,280.Medicare's secondary payment is $340 and the combined payment made by thethird party payer and Medicare on behalf of the beneficiary is $2,700.The $520 deductible was satisfied by the third party payment so that thebeneficiary incurred no out-of-pocket expenses.(2) A hospital furnished 1 day of inpatient hospital care in 1987 to aMedicare beneficiary. The provider's charges for Medicare-covered servicestotalled $750. The third party payer paid $450. No part of the Medicareinpatient hospital deductible had been met previously. The third partypayment is credited toward that deductible. If the gross amount payableby Medicare in this case is $850, then as secondary payer, Medicare paysthe lowest of the following amounts:(i) The gross amount payable by Medicare minus the Medicare deductible:$850^$520=$330.(ii) The gross amount payable by Medicare minus the third party payment:$850^$450=$400.(iii) The provider's charges minus the third party payment: $750^$450=$300.(iv) The provider's charges minus the Medicare deductible: $750^$520=$230.Medicare's secondary payment is $230, and the combined payment made bythe third party payer and Medicare on behalf of the beneficiary is $680.The hospital may bill the beneficiary $70 (the $520 deductible minus the$450 third party payment).

No part of the beneficiary's$75 Part B deductible had been met. The third party payer paid $1,024 forMedicare-covered services. The composite rate per dialysis treatment atthis facility is $131 or $1,048 for 8 treatments. As secondary payer, Medicarepays the lowest of the following:(i) The gross amoung payable by Medicare minus the applicable Medicaredeductible and coinsurance: $1,048^$75^$194.60=$778.40.

The beneficiary's Medicare deductible and coinsurancewere met by the third party payment.(4) A hospital furnished 5 days of inpatient care in 1987 to a Medicarebeneficiary. The provider's charges for Medicare-covered services were$4,000 and the gross amount payable was $3,500. The provider agreed toaccept $3,000 from the third party as payment in full. The third partypayer paid $2,900 due to a deductible requirement under the third partyplan. Medicare considers the amount the provider is obligated to acceptas full payment ($3,000) to be the provider charges. The Medicare secondarypayment is the lowest of the following:(i) The gross amount payable by Medicare minus the Medicare inpatient deductible:$3,500^$520=$2,980.(ii) The gross amount payable by Medicare minus the third party payment:$3,500^$2,900=$600.(iii) The provider's charge minus the third party payment: $3,000^$2,900=$100.(iv) The provider's charges minus the Medicare inpatient deductible: $3,000^$520=$2,480.The Medicare secondary payment is $100.
