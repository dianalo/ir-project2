Lee with the help of a junior Morgan employee.    The SEC has alleged that Mr. Lee netted more than $19 million by trading on confidential information about Morgan merger deals that was provided to him, for payments totaling $200,000, by a 24-year-old Morgan analyst, Steven Wang Jr. As reported, Mr. Lee maintained five trading accounts at Morgan, and Morgan officials had investigated Mr. Lee's trading at the firm beginning last fall and concluded there was nothing improper.    Meanwhile, it was learned that officials of a Hong Kong-based securities subsidiary of Aetna Life andamp; Casualty Co., through which Mr. Lee allegedly did much of his trading, are cooperating with the government. The subsidiary is Federated International Investment Management. The SEC is examining the role of a Federated account manager in Hong Kong, Orlando Lobo, who handled Mr. Lee's trades, according to people familiar with the case. In Hartford, Conn., an Aetna spokesman said that &quot;we have no reason to believe any employees of Aetna or Federated are being investigated.&quot;    And the SEC disclosed that some of Mr. Lee's trades were done through accounts in Switzerland. The SEC is currently negotiating with Swiss authorities to obtain additional information and freeze assets there, according to SEC Chairman David Ruder.    Morgan Stanley came under criticism during a hearing of the Senate securities subcommittee, at which Mr. Ruder testified. Sen. Donald Riegle (D., Mich), the subcommittee chairman, said, &quot;It's hard for me to understand how the pattern of insider trading could have gone on so long . . . and not have come to light by internal surveillance mechanisms.&quot;    Mr. Ruder responded, &quot;The fact that there may have been transactions in Mr. Lee's accounts and nominee accounts in that very firm {Morgan} is a very serious question for us.&quot;    Separately, industry sources say the Big Board is looking at, among other things, whether Morgan was negligent in failing to properly supervise the work of Mr. Wang. The analyst was suspended by Morgan last Friday, three days before the SEC filed a civil case against him and Mr. Lee in a New York federal court.    The exchange is also looking at trading accounts that Morgan handled for Mr. Lee to see if any other Morgan employees had any knowledge of the investor's activities, these people say.    A senior Morgan official declined to comment on either the SEC or Big Board actions, or the comments at the subcommittee hearing.    A spokeswoman for the Big Board said the exchange doesn't comment on ongoing investigations.    Gary Lynch, the SEC's enforcement chief, declined to say if he is satisfied with the cooperation he has received thus far from Morgan Stanley, saying only that he hopes they promptly cooperate as the case proceeds. Asked if they have done that so far, he again declined to comment. Morgan has said it is cooperating with the investigation.    Mr. Ruder said the SEC began looking into the matter after a staff attorney read a newspaper article about suspicious trading in a stock. Mr. Lynch identified the stock as E-II Holdings Inc., one of 25 named in the SEC case against Messrs. Lee and Wang.    The subsequent inquiry led to Hong Kong and Federated, where much of Mr. Lee's trading was placed, the SEC chairman said.    The SEC then asked U.S. Customs to look out for Mr. Lobo, the Federated official based in Hong Kong. Customs notified the SEC when Mr. Lobo entered the U.S. The SEC then served Mr. Lobo with a subpeona, Mr. Ruder said. &quot;It was his testimony that confirmed to us that the suspicious trading was indeed that of Mr. Lee,&quot; he said.    Seymour Glanzer, attorney for Mr. Lobo, said that he understood that his client &quot;has no problem&quot; with the SEC.    The SEC and the Big Board are also reviewing Mr. Lee's trading in accounts he maintained at other firms, including Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., Goldman Sachs andamp; Co., First Boston Corp., Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. and Charles Schwab andamp; Co., according to people familiar with the investigations.    An official at Shearson said that Mr. Lee maintained a brokerage account at Shearson's Hong Kong office but that the firm wasn't aware of any wrongdoing.    A First Boston official said that Mr. Lee had &quot;a couple of accounts&quot; at First Boston through which he did &quot;very modest&quot; trading. A review of that trading found &quot;absolutely nothing suspicious,&quot; the First Boston official said. First Boston found that Mr. Lee had traded in only one of the securities named in the SEC complaint, said the official, who wouldn't identify the security. The official said Mr. Lee had a loss on the trading, which took place after rumors about this particular security had already surfaced in the press.    A Goldman spokesman said, &quot;We have reviewed the trading in the account with us and it appears entirely innocuous.&quot;    Merrill Lynch and Schwab declined comment.    The SEC officials appeared before the securities panel to discuss a bill recently introduced by Sen. Riegle and other members of the Senate Banking Committee aimed at helping the SEC deal with foreign-based insider trading. A similar bill was introduced in the House yesterday by Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman John Dingell (D., Mich.) and several others.    Both bills would give the SEC powers it has requested to conduct investigations in this country on behalf of foreign authorities, to keep confidential the records it receives from those authorities, and to take action against securities industry professionals for violations of foreign securities laws. The bills are regarded as relatively noncontroversial on Capitol Hill and may be enacted this year.    Separately, Mr. Ruder said he opposes increasing the penalties for insider trading, as several lawmakers have proposed. &quot;I think the penalties are strong enough,&quot; he said. &quot;We have a five-year criminal sanction for this activity. That's a very large number of years for white-collar criminal behavior.&quot;    ---   Bryan Burrough and Daniel Hertzberg contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
