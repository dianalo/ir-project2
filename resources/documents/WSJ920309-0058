In the store window behind him, a poster for St.Ides Premium Malt Liquor prods customers to &quot;Pump It Up.&quot;Below that, a neon sign hawks Schlitz Red Bull.   At age 18, Mr. Roberts still can't buy alcohol legally.But thanks to the zealous efforts of malt liquor marketers,along with the lax enforcement of many grocery owners, he anda growing number of youthful drinkers are flocking to thehigh-powered brews. &quot;This summer, everybody started talkingabout St. Ides, so I tried it,&quot; says Mr. Roberts, who droppedout of high school and now works stocking shelves in a store.&quot;That's the name brand now.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Malts like St. Ides, Olde English 800 and King Cobra havebecome a prestige symbol among some inner-city youths. Kidsas young as 13 now wield 40-ounce bottles of malt, whichcorner grocery stores sell for $1.50. While total beerconsumption declined 2.4% last year, sales of the so-calledup-strength malts are growing at an annual rate of 25% to30%, according to marketing executives.   &quot;It's status,&quot; says Lumumba Bandele, 20, who works as ayouth counselor with Manhattan Valley Youth Program. &quot;Theattitude is, `You're a man if you've got a 40 in your hand.'&quot;   Health workers say the current popularity of malt liquoramong some inner-city young may be partly due to the successof drug education and treatment. The percentage ofhigh-school seniors using crack cocaine has dropped to 1.5%from 4.1% in 1986, according to a survey by University ofMichigan researchers. Use of most illegal drugs has alsodeclined somewhat. Today &quot;their rap is `I'm drinking maltliquor, but at least I'm not doing crack,'&quot; says PedroEspada, director of the Soundview Health Center in the SouthBronx.   As a result, community activists predict a steady increasein alcohol-related diseases and violence. &quot;We've got a fireraging in the inner city, and malt liquor companies arepouring gasoline on that fire,&quot; charges Ronald Brinn,public-affairs director for the Jamaica Community AdolescentProgram, a substance-abuse counseling center in Queens.   Malt liquor is made much like other beer, but it typicallycontains 4.5% or more alcohol, compared with 3.5% to 4% inmost beers. St. Ides contains about 6% alcohol, about asstrong as beer can get and remain palatable (wine, bycomparison, is about 13% alcohol). Even so, St. Ides tastesso harsh that some drinkers mix it with orange juice. Maltliquors, especially the old-line brands Schlitz and Colt 45,have traditionally been favored by older, blue-collar men.   Today the $500 million malt market is being revitalized byhigher alcohol levels, lower prices and rap heroes like IceCube and the Geto Boys, which are luring a new generation ofdrinkers. While most liquor makers preach moderation, somemalt marketers imply their products are a cheap drunk. In onecommercial, no longer airing, rapper Ice Cube boasted he&quot;grabbed me a 40 just to get my buzz on, 'cause I needed justa little more kick.&quot;   Malt's current cachet among young drinkers may have a lotto do with the sophisticated marketing campaigns of thelittle-known McKenzie River Corp. for its four-year-old St.Ides brand. The company has a contract brewing arrangementwith G. Heileman Brewing Co., maker of Colt 45. Heilemanmakes St. Ides at a Wisconsin brewery and distributes it, andMcKenzie, which created the formula for the brew, markets it.   Commercials for St. Ides originally featured the smoothsounds of the Four Tops. But the company soon shifted to adsfeaturing popular rap stars whose rebellious rhymes exalteddrinking, sexual prowess or gang violence.   The nation's biggest brewers, which have traditionallyplayed a small role in the malt-liquor category, are takingnote of the growing popularity of strong malts. BothAnheuser-Busch Cos. and the Miller Brewing unit of PhilipMorris Cos., the nation's No. 1 and No. 2 brewers, areaggressively pricing high-power malts as cheaply as theindustry has ever seen: 32 ounces for 99 cents.   &quot;The growth in the industry has been fastest in ethnicmarkets in major cities,&quot; says John Ferolito, president ofUnited Beers Inc. of Brooklyn. &quot;We're going where the marketis.&quot; United Beers, which markets the Midnight Dragon brand,is preparing to launch another malt tentatively called CrazyHorse.   The mom-and-pop stores that dot inner cities have becomethe primary sellers of the upstrength malts, which seldomappear in affluent enclaves. Corner groceries are moreaccessible to underage drinkers than liquor stores. At theRiden Supermarket in Harlem, tall cans of Olde English 800,40-ounce bottles of St. Ides and 64-ounce bottles of MidnightDragon crowd the cooler. A young man who calls himself Mitchgrabs a tall can of Olde English. Within two hours, he's backfor another. It's a ritual that's repeated every day, saysowner David Annisafi, who estimates that he sells up to 20cases of malt each week, compared with just three cases ofbeer.   McKenzie River knows its hard-core drinkers well. The firmis run by Minott Wessinger, 35, a sixth-generation beerseller whose father, Fred Wessinger, virtually created themarket for upstrength malts in the 1960s with his OldeEnglish 800 brand. Now the No. 3 seller among malts, OldeEnglish was acquired by Pabst Brewing Co. of San Antonio in1979.   Although McKenzie River has annual sales of only about $12million, it has benefited from ties to the much largerHeileman. Documents in a recent lawsuit show that Heilemangives McKenzie River clout beyond its size by helping St.Ides judge the credit-worthiness of its distributors and evenbilling them for the product. &quot;Our arrangement with McKenzieRiver is essentially the same as our other contract packagingarrangements,&quot; says Randy Smith, Heileman vice president andgeneral counsel. Other brands Heileman makes include SamuelAdams beer, Midnight Dragon malt liquor and severalnonalcoholic brews.   Last summer, Heileman tried to follow St. Ides into thehigh-octane-brew field with a brand called PowerMaster, whichsparked a federal investigation into the practices of maltmarketers. After the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearmsvetoed the PowerMaster name as a violation of federal rulesthat prohibit marketers from touting alcohol content,Heileman withdrew it from the market.   In McKenzie River's hands, the St. Ides message has beenquantity, with ads routinely presenting a 40-ounce bottle asa serving. In one commercial, rap singer King Tee said, &quot;Iusually drink it when I'm out just clowning, me and the homeboys, you know, be like downing it. Cause it's stronger butthe taste is more smooth. I grab me a 40 when I want to act afool.&quot;   McKenzie River has also pitched the beer as enhancingsexual performance. In what may be the company's mostexplicit commercial, Ice Cube advised getting &quot;your girl inthe mood quicker, and get your jimmy thicker with St. Idesmalt liquor.&quot; McKenzie River pulled that ad last year.   St. Ides's commercials became so popular that the companycompiled many of them on promotional tapes. Some 40,000 ofthe cassettes were given to retailers, while distributorspapered inner-city stores with St. Ides posters showing IceCube making a hand sign -- thumb, index and little fingersextended -- associated with street gangs. The retailers gaveout the tapes and posters to young patrons.   McKenzie River's other promotional tactics were even morecontroversial among regulators and inner-city communityactivists. The company's sales representatives routinelyaffixed stickers on containers of St. Ides warning consumers,&quot;Caution: Most Powerful Malt&quot; or touted it as &quot;No. 1strongest malt&quot; -- a violation of federal rules. They stoppeddoing so last year.   The brand's status as a fashion accessory was cementedafter a character in the hit movie &quot;Boyz N The Hood,&quot; playedby Ice Cube, was shown repeatedly drinking from a 40-ouncebottle of malt. McKenzie River officials say they didn't payto have their product included in the movie, and a spokesmanfor Sony Corp.'s Columbia Pictures unit confirms that IceCube suggested the liquid prop. A spokeswoman for Ice Cube'srecord company says he isn't available for interviews whileon tour.   &quot;They were smart to choose Ice Cube because he gets acrossto the kids,&quot; says David, 20, a recovering alcoholic in atreatment program in Queens, N.Y. As a child, David says, hismother gave him sips to help him sleep. At 13, he startedbuying 16-ounce cans of Olde English and soon graduated to40-ounce bottles. Four years later, after an Olde Englishbinge, he got into a fistfight with his father and left home.&quot;Every generation has its brand,&quot; he says. &quot;Right now, it'sSt. Ides.&quot;   In recent months, malt liquor marketing has come underfire from government regulators. In the wake of its crackdownon PowerMaster, the alcohol bureau began enforcing federalregulations that prohibit malt purveyors from referring tothe strength of their brands on containers or in ads.   The federal agency has come down hardest on McKenzieRiver, at one point even threatening to sue. The bureau hadtaken issue with ads that implied St. Ides enhances sex andothers that asserted competing brands could make consumerssick. The bureau also assailed St. Ides for associating thebrand with gangs.   McKenzie River has come under attack from local groups aswell. After community activists in New York protested thatSt. Ides was targeting young blacks, New York's attorneygeneral's office began an investigation. Last month, thestate reached a $50,000 settlement with McKenzie River thatrequires it to refrain from advertising the product in a waythat falsely suggests it will increase male virility. Theagreement also requires the company to refrain from toutingthe brand's alcohol content or promoting the beverage toconsumers under 21.   &quot;It was certainly never our intent to create commercialsthat would offend anyone,&quot; says Minott Wessinger. &quot;Theartists write the commercials themselves, because it was ourobjective to make them real. But, as rap is controversial, sowere some of our ads.&quot;   Government regulators say their efforts to clean up thecategory have been largely successful. &quot;Most of theadvertisers know what the problems were, and they have movedin a responsible direction to correct them,&quot; says TerryCates, the bureau's chief of industry compliance. &quot;I thinkeverybody is falling into line.&quot;   But in many inner cities, critics say, it seems likebusiness as usual. The actual changes required by the bureauhaven't been significant, they charge. Pabst, for example,changed the slogan for its Olde English brand to &quot;It's theTiger&quot; from &quot;It's the Power.&quot; It has rebuffed a suggestionthat it stop referring to its brand in some ads as eight ball-- street slang, according to law-enforcement officials, forbuying an eighth of an ounce of cocaine. Pabst says thecompany is not alluding to drugs. Stroh Brewing Co.,meanwhile, simply modified the lyrics of its commercials toremove the word &quot;power.&quot;   And though the bureau has banned several ads, it didn'trequire marketers to remove existing point-of-sale materials,and many controversial ads remain. Four posters showingrapper Ice Cube making the hand gesture associated withgangs, for example, still cover the windows of the Stop 1'sFirst Stop Dairy on Merrick Boulevard in Queens. ClimithNewkirk, who runs the small store, estimates he still has 50of the posters in his back room.   Mr. Wessinger of McKenzie River says his company hasscrambled to obey federal guidelines. In December, thecompany settled the last of its disputes with the bureau,agreeing to discontinue several ads and pay a $10,000 fine.&quot;It was always our objective to comply with the Bureau ofAlcohol, Tobacco and Firearms,&quot; Mr. Wessinger says. &quot;As soonas they contacted us, we pulled all the commercials.&quot;   To further polish its image, McKenzie River has teamed upwith Ice Cube to donate money to several communityorganizations. Its largess has included a $25,000 gift toKing/Drew Medical Center in Los Angeles and a $90,000contribution to an association of Korean grocers, who hadcomplained that lyrics on one of Ice Cube's albums wereracist. McKenzie River has also backed gang-interventionprograms and low-income housing projects, according to Mr.Wessinger. &quot;We give a lot for a company our size,&quot; he says.   The firm is now running several new commercials with morepositive messages. In one, rapper Willie D reminds St. Idesaficionados that &quot;Friends don't let other friends drivedrunk&quot; and that &quot;DWI ain't fly {cool}.&quot; In another, Ice Cubecajoles consumers not to drink unless they're 21. It's worththe wait, he raps, adding, &quot;I got me a 40 on my 21stbirthday.&quot;   Some critics are skeptical. &quot;They've said they were goingto change in the past, and they haven't,&quot; says Makani Themba,public policy specialist of the Marin Institute, anorganization trying to prevent substance abuse. McKenzieRiver still implies 40 ounces is a single serving. And onecurrent St. Ides ad that features the Geto Boys borrowsheavily from the group's hit &quot;My Mind's Playin' Tricks onMe.&quot; The song's main character: a drug dealer.</TEXT></DOC>
