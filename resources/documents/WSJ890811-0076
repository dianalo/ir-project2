The revocation involves chlorzoxazone, a generic version of Parafon Forte, made by a Johnson andamp; Johnson division. Par received its approval for the muscle relaxant June 5 and ATI got its approval June 23.    FDA Commissioner Frank E. Young emphasized that if the generic drug scandal worsens &quot;there is a real possibility&quot; that the industry &quot;may be totally discredited.&quot; He added that unless the agency moves swiftly &quot;to safeguard the generic drug review system, the potential for a loss in public trust in generic drugs may be realized.&quot; Three FDA employees have pleaded guilty to charges that they took illegal gratuities from generic drug firms, and Commissioner Young has testified that he expects more indictments within the agency.    Brand name drug companies are also affected by the FDA investigation of generic drug companies. Agency approvals of both brand name and generic drugs have &quot;slowed dramatically,&quot; in the past couple of months, Mr. Young said, as the FDA performs retrospective reviews of already marketed generic drugs. &quot;These re-evaluations are aimed at ensuring that previous approvals were conducted in a fair and scientifically sound manner and were not based on fraudulent information,&quot; he said.    Mr. Young has come under attack from the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee as well as from generic drug makers to revoke drug approvals from companies that cheated or made payoffs to obtain drug approvals. Leading this effort are Mylan Laboratories Inc., Pittsburgh, and Barr Laboratories Inc. of Pomona, N.Y. Barr even took the unusual step of petitioning the FDA to revoke all drug approvals granted to Par since 1986 and to ATI since October 1984.    The FDA's action against Par, of Spring Valley, N.Y., and American Therapeutics, of Bohemia, N.Y., didn't arise from allegations of payoffs related to the approval of chlorzoxazone. Instead, the action was based on plant inspections that disclosed &quot;significant manufacturing problems,&quot; according to a letter to the Health and Human Services Department from Commissioner Young. The letter wasn't more specific about what problems were found.    David Weeda, an attorney for ATI, charged that the FDA didn't follow proper procedures to revoke the drug. &quot;The FDA had no legal authority to do it, and there's nothing wrong with the product.&quot; Mr. Weeda also said only problems with the company's labeling and packaging turned up during the FDA's inspection. He said the drug never was sold on the market.    A spokesman at Par confirmed that the FDA revoked its chlorzoxazone approval after it had already begun shipping the drug. The spokesman said the revocation came in the midst of a plant inspection that is still running and began &quot;in May or June. The FDA inspectors are still here. They've given us one report, a list of findings, and I don't know whether we've fully responded.&quot; He said the FDA didn't find any health or safety problems with the drug.    FDA Commissioner Young said in the letter that the agency should have held off on approving Par's and ATI's applications. &quot;Given that, we have decided to rescind these approvals, despite the risk of ensuing litigation,&quot; he said.    The FDA's action seems to reverse an earlier position. In July, Commissioner Young testified before a congressional subcommittee that the FDA didn't have any legal grounds to withhold products made by companies involved in wrongdoing or companies whose employees have made payoffs to speed up or slow down drug approvals. He said at the time that if the FDA were to take such action it would expose itself to undue risk of litigation.    Mr. Young also testified that the FDA could act more swiftly if legislation were passed allowing it to debar companies involved in corruption or to revoke or refuse to approve applications from companies over a certain length of time.    Earlier this week Par said that its president plans to retire and that it expects to report a net loss of more than $1.7 million for its fiscal third quarter. The loss for the quarter, ended July 1, includes about $3.5 million in charges related to product recalls, fines related to guilty pleas by the company in the federal criminal investigation, and certain write-offs. A year earlier, the company had net income of $2 million, or 18 cents a share, on sales of $24.7 million.    Par and its Quad unit recently pleaded guilty to one count of providing an unlawful gratuity to an FDA employee. A former senior vice president of Par, Ashok Patel, and Dilip P. Shah, former president of Quad, each pleaded guilty to a related charge.    Subsequently, the company disclosed that it had filed false drug data with the FDA, was recalling one of its drugs and had stopped selling two others. So far, the company has recalled three drugs.    Of the three FDA reviewers who pleaded guilty to accepting bribes, one acknowledged accepting illegal gratuities totaling $9,600 from former top officers at ATI. A former FDA generic branch chief pleaded guilty to two counts of interstate travel in aid of racketeering after accepting a trip to Bangkok and London and after accepting furniture paid for at the direction of ATI's president. The third FDA reviewer pleaded guilty to accepting two $500 gift certificates from Mr. Shah.    The company, which hasn't been charged in the criminal investigation, has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing on its part or that of its executives. </TEXT></DOC>
