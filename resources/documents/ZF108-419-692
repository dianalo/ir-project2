Mikel, library program manager in the directorate ofinformation management.andM;LS-2000 searches by author, title, government document number, corps seriesnumber, contract number, project number or programming language.andP;  Queriesproduce a display of pertinent publications, call numbers, availability andlocations.andM;&quot;LS-2000 takes a matter of minutes to do what would take hours with a cardcatalog,&quot; Mikel said.andP;  &quot;Maintaining a card catalog is almost a full-timejob.&quot;andM;LS-2000 also has automated check-out.andM;&quot;In the past, a librarian with a request for a certain design memorandum hadto make a lot of phone calls to track it down,&quot; Mikel said.andP;  &quot;This way, youcan search and see who has it.andP;  The system generates overdue notices andkeeps very clear records of where the item is.&quot;andM;On-line Computer Library Center Inc. of Dublin, Ohio, developed LS-2000,which runs under the MIIS operating system originally designed for hospitalsby Medical Information Technology Inc. of Westwood, Mass.andP;  Library personnelat Corps of Engineers headquarters tailored the software to corpsrequirements.andM;The LS-2000 database is maintained in two ways.andP;  On-line Computer LibraryCenter runs a large national bibliographic database from which corpslibrarians can download records into the LS-2000 catalog.andP;  Or they can loadrecords directly through interfaces.andM;LS-2000 runs on a Data General Corp. MV 15000 Model 10 installed at corpsheadquarters in Washington.andP;  Many of the 52 libraries have leased ATandamp;T Co.andO;connections.andP;  West Coast sites are mostly dial-in.andP;  Sites in the southeasternUnited States and Frankfurt, West Germany, use Bell Atlantic NetworkServices' LANgate, Mikel said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
