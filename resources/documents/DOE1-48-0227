<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-48-0227 </DOCNO><TEXT>We announce the solution of the old problem of relativistic quantum fieldtheory, namely the (nonperturbative) construction of interacting localrelativistic quantum fields over four-dimensional spacetime satisfyingall axioms. The fields are obtained starting from euclidean random fieldssatisfying systems of coupled stochastic partial differential equations.Using their Markov property with respect to three-dimensional hyperplanesand gauge invariance, we construct from these fields new euclidean randomfields which are Osterwalder-Schrader reflection positive, yielding asymmetric contraction semigroup generated by a positive hamiltonian ona L/sup 2/-space of gauge invariant functions. The relativistic fieldsare then obtained by analytic continuation. The constructed fields areinteracting, asymptotically free and are the continuum limits of latticefields. An expression for their hamiltonian is provided.</TEXT></DOC>
