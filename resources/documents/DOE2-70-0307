Following intravenous injection of 3mCi ofI-123 E2, multiple sequential images were obtained over the thorax, includingthe breasts. Over the next 4 hours multiple planar images of thorax,abdomen, and pelvis were obtained. At 2 hours after injection singlephoton emission tomography (SPECT) demonstrated seven of eight primarybreast lesions known to be estrogen receptor positive (ER+). The oneER+ missed had received chemotherapy, which was discontinued only 2 weeksprior to the study. Three proven ER+ metastases, including an ER+ axillarynode, were demonstrated by SPECT. One ER- breast lesion was not identified.In one patient, the contralateral breast, normal to mammography and palpation,was abnormal by SPECT. The authors postulate biochemical identificationER+ breast tissue prior to anatomic identification of breast cancer.</TEXT></DOC>
