The House accepted a Senate provision that would requirebanks to repay in 15 years a $30 billion line of credit thatthe Treasury would provide to replenish the bank depositinsurance fund. Banks would repay the funds through theirinsurance premiums to the FDIC.</LP><TEXT>   Late yesterday afternoon, the taxpayer loan to coverdepositors at failed banks was the most important element ofa broad banking bill that had been stripped down in an effortto win passage in both chambers before adjournment for theyear. The bill would provide $70 billion for the nearlyinsolvent bank deposit insurance fund to cover industrylosses. The remaining $40 billion would be repaid through theliquidation of bad bank assets. The bill also tightens bankregulation.   Plowing slowly through mostly technical amendments andbreaking frequently for votes on the House and Senate floors,the conferees even bogged down when one side was ready toacquiesce. &quot;This is going to be a long conference when wecan't get them to let us {concede} to them,&quot; groused Sen.Jake Garn (R., Utah).   But the agreement on foreign deposits came after aspirited debate. The negotiators agreed that banks should payspecial insurance premiums on $224 billion of foreigndeposits in U.S. banks if foreign depositors are reimbursedwhen a bank fails. Currently, banks don't pay premiums onforeign deposits to the FDIC, even if the agency protectsforeign deposits when a bank fails.   The decision was a partial victory for small banks, whichhave long complained that Morgan Guaranty, Citibank and otherbanks that rely heavily on foreign deposits have access tolower-cost funds. Banks currently pay a premium of 23 centsper $100 of domestic deposits.   The accord addressed one of the central provisions of thebill -- the elimination of the so-called too-big-to-faildoctrine. Currently, the FDIC reimburses most uninsureddeposits -- those over the $100,000 insurance ceiling andthose made in foreign branches of U.S. banks -- if theFederal Reserve concludes that failing to protect alldeposits would threaten the stability of the financialsystem.   Under the banking bill, the too-big-to-fail doctrineexpires Dec. 31, 1994, generally barring the FDIC from payingoff uninsured deposits. The conferees, however, agreed tolimited exceptions when the Fed, the FDIC and the TreasuryDepartment agree that payment of all deposits -- insured anduninsured -- is necessary to protect the banking network fromsystemic risk. In those limited cases, the additional cost ofcarrying the systemic risk would be repaid by a specialassessment indirectly based on all deposits, foreign anddomestic.   The House version of the bill barred the payment offoreign deposits under any circumstance. But the Fed, theTreasury and the Senate argued that the Federal Reserve Boardmust be given the flexibility to protect the financial systemwhen it faces extraordinary strains.   The limitation on the use of the too-big-to-fail doctrineis one of several measures being adopted to shrink thefederal safety net for banks. The conferees agreed to anotherprovision designed to limit the Fed's ability to prop up sickbanks with long-term loans through its discount window. Bothmeasures are designed to slow the drain on the depositinsurance fund.   Banks were happy with the conference agreement on the loanbecause it also eliminated a floor determining how lowdeposit insurance premiums could fall. The Senate bill calledfor banks to pay insurance premiums of no less than 23 centsper $100 of assets. Bankers said that in some economicallysuffering regions of the country, insurance premiums at thatlevel would push some weak banks into insolvency. &quot;We are alittle concerned about the 15 years,&quot; said Robert Dugger,chief economist for the American Bankers Association. &quot;But ifwe run into deeper losses, we will be back here anyway&quot;seeking another taxpayer loan.</TEXT></DOC>
