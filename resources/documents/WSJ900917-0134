As custody and financial battles between estranged spousesgrow more intense, divorce lawyers are wondering whetherputting up a good fight for their clients is always ethical.The 1,200-member American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers isdrafting a code of ethics that will address such conundrums.The group says it is making a special effort to addressobligations to children.   Stephen Sessums, a Tampa, Fla., lawyer and chairman of thecommittee drafting the code, says the &quot;Rambo lawyer&quot; who uses&quot;the legal arsenal to bludgeon the other side&quot; may inflictlasting damage on family relationships that must survive abitter divorce. &quot;It is important to look for ways to reach acompromise or decision or a result where everybody wins,&quot; hesays.   Robert H. Aronson, an associate dean of the University ofWashington School of Law who is helping to draft the code,says it will strongly encourage settlement or arbitration indivorces.   The code is also likely to suggest that lawyers considerthe best interests of children during divorce proceedings andthat they report incidents of child abuse or the possibilityof abuse to authorities, even if their client is the abuser,says Mr. Aronson.                                                                                                          And You Think There Are   Too Many Practicing Law                                                                                                          SOME LAWYERS say Scott Turow had the right idea.   In the wake of the success of Mr. Turow's &quot;PresumedInnocent&quot; and &quot;The Burden of Proof,&quot; many lawyers have takento their word processors. Several have recently producedcrime novels, complete with allegedly true-to-life courtroomscenes.   Bantam Books just published &quot;To Speak for the Dead,&quot; byPaul Levine, a Miami lawyer. Mr. Levine, once a partner inthe Miami office of Morgan Lewis andamp; Bockius, a law firm basedin Philadelphia, says he found &quot;running around the countrydefending asbestos cases . . . to be a less than personallysatisfying experience.&quot; He says his main character &quot;reflectssome of my cynicism.&quot;   For Jay Brandon's &quot;Fade the Heat,&quot; published last month byPocket Books, an option on the movie rights has beenpurchased by Steven Spielberg. Mr. Brandon, who wrote threeprevious novels, just quit his job drafting opinions with theCourt of Appeals in San Antonio, Texas, and expects to devotehis time to writing and criminal defense work. The jacket ofhis novel touts it as &quot;a masterpiece of legal intrigue in thebest Scott Turow tradition.&quot;   But despite the success of Mr. Turow, a partner in aChicago law firm, some publishers wish lawyers would stick topracticing law. &quot;All lawyers think that they can writebecause they dictate interminably,&quot; says Howard Kaminsky,president of Hearst Trade Book Group. &quot;A lot more wordprocessors {are} being bought and a lot more lawyers {are}writing novels,&quot; Mr. Kaminsky says, but &quot;I don't look forwardto reading them.&quot;                                                                                                          Large Firms Overcome   Marketing Reticence                                                                                                          BIG LAW FIRMS, which traditionally have eschewedself-promotion, are making some bold marketing moves.   The July issue of California Lawyer, a trade publication,had a six-page color advertisement for Baker andamp; McKenzie,which has 1,600 lawyers in 44 countries. A profile of the lawfirm was accompanied by photos of lawyers and a world mapwith Baker andamp; McKenzie's branches marked. The ad cost about$35,000.   &quot;No law firm has ever done anything like that before,&quot;says Chet Holmes, California Lawyer's associate publisher.&quot;No law firm has ever run a profile of itself in anypublication.&quot;   Timothy Tosta, a partner in the firm, says that althoughsome of his colleagues were reluctant to place the ad, it has&quot;brought us enormous recognition, which inevitably leads tobusiness.&quot;   Squire, Sanders andamp; Dempsey, a firm of about 400 lawyersbased in Cleveland, is trying a subtler approach. To mark itscentennial, it has underwritten the cost of an exhibit ofpaintings by Winslow Homer at the Cleveland Museum of Art.The show will travel to museums in Columbus, Ohio, andWashington, D.C., where the law firm also has offices.   Squire Sanders's donation was $450,000, payable over threeyears. Museum and law firm spokesmen say they believe it isthe largest gift ever by a law firm to a culturalinstitution.   John F. Lewis, a Squire Sanders partner, says an earlypartner of the firm was instrumental in founding the museum,and the firm decided the gift was an appropriate way to say&quot;thank you to the community that gave birth to us andnurtured us.&quot;                                                                                                          California PAC Adopts   A Higher Profile                                                                                                          CALIFORNIA lawyers are becoming more aggressive in thepolitical arena about their professional interests.   The California Lawyers Political Action Committee waslaunched in 1988 to oppose legislation &quot;that was anti-lawyer,anti-consumer,&quot; says P. Terry Anderlini, the PAC's treasurerand a former state bar group president. So far, it hasopposed a push for non-licensed legal technicians and foughtproposed changes in how judicial candidates are reviewed. ThePAC recently decided to hire a lobbyist and take positions onlegislation on legal issues.   But that will take money, and so far the PAC has raised alittle over $30,000. &quot;I don't find lawyers eager to givemoney,&quot; says Luther Avery, a San Francisco lawyer who hastried his hand at fund raising for the PAC. &quot;It's a hardsell. The automatic response {by} a lawyer to any question is`No,' or `I'll think about it.'&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
