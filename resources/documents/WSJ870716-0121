Seen as a way of reducing misdiagnoses, unneeded tests and insurance fraud, medical-data systems are aimed at a broader market than just serving those with special problems, such as allergies. For $28 per family, Affiliated Health Care Inc., Princeton, N.J., encodes medical histories on computer chips in wallet-sized cards. Med-Fax, Marina del Rey, Calif., charges $35 a year for a medical file in a voice computer that &quot;speaks&quot; to emergency-room personnel over the telephone. Life-Card International Inc., a Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Maryland unit, develops a statewide computer system in preparation for encoding medical data on insurance ID cards.    But the proliferation of systems creates &quot;the specter of an emergency room that has to have 15 different types of reading devices,&quot; says Richard Wilbur of the Council of Medical Specialty Societies. News of credit-card companies entering the field prompts his group to host a conference on standardizing emergency medical forms.    Business is a prime market. Nonprofit Medic Alert Foundation International commissions two studies on cost saving to attract corporate members.    TRANSIT LINES shed their commuter image to raise weekend ridership.    Special weekend packages sprout across the country as transit agencies woo the short-distance recreational traveler. For $20 to $30, Chicagoans can spend a &quot;Day in the Country&quot; with a Metra package that includes travel by train and chartered bus, lunch and a tour of a local historical community. In New Jersey, NJ Transit packages include: a day-long trip to a winery, luncheon and a cruise on the Hudson River; trips to state beaches and an outing to a Pennsylvania amusement park.    The trips, often money-losers, are part of an effort to nurture ridership during off-peak hours. &quot;It's an investment,&quot; says a spokesman for San Francisco's BART system, which this month begins a trial 3-for-1 weekend family fare. Some programs are already showing good growth. New York's Metro North Commuter Railroad says ridership of weekend excursions to the New York City Botanical Garden, started in 1985, grew 30% last year and is up 30% this year. All NJ Transit outings at least break even.    MACHINERY COMPANIES begin to feel the benefits of a weaker dollar.    Economists have been predicting a turnaround as the declining dollar made U.S. capital goods affordable both at home and abroad. Now domestic machinery producers are cautiously reporting the long-awaited rebound in orders. In June, for example, fluid-power system maker Parker Hannifin Corp., Cleveland, saw a 13% increase in orders from a year earlier. &quot;On the basis of 30-day order comparisons, it is happening,&quot; says W.C. Young, treasurer.    The turnaround should have staying power, says Thomas Burns Jr., analyst for Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. Companies are leaner and meaner than they were in the early '80s, he says, and thus &quot;are probably competitive at a lot higher level of the dollar.&quot; That's important if the economic expansion is to continue, says Adrian Dillon, chief economist of Eaton Corp., Cleveland, noting that consumer spending has begun to slow.    Orders are rising faster than shipments, indicating there's more growth ahead, Mr. Dillon says.    &quot;L.A. LAW&quot; ETHICS come under scrutiny next month at the annual meeting of the American Bar Association's Tort andamp; Insurance Practice Section. Lawyers will watch clips of the TV series and hear its staff, including actor Richard Dysart, talk about how the show handles legal issues.    WELFARE CHECKS go electronic in St. Paul, Minn. A test program has 1,000 recipients of Aid to Families with Dependent Children collecting their benefits by using a special magnetic-stripped identification card at automatic teller machines.    BALLROOM ROMEOS in Mexican resorts are blamed for $3.6 million in credit-card fraud, says Visa U.S.A. Inc. The scam: Men asked U.S. women tourists to dance while accomplices quickly used the tourists' credit cards to imprint blank sales drafts. Merchants bought the slips for $20 each, writing in transactions averaging $200.    NEW COLLEGE GRADS find more companies seeking their business.    Toyota Motor Co. launches a pilot program in Chicago, Boston, Denver and San Francisco, waiving car down payments for graduates with bona fide job offers. &quot;We'll probably make it a national program for next year,&quot; says Tony Merritt, Toyota's national merchandising manager. Ford Motor Co. increased its mailings to seniors 10% this year. It offers seniors and graduate students a $400 cash allowance toward a car down payment or purchase and gives special credit terms to students who have proof of a job offer.    &quot;Seniors are a very big priority item in terms of acquisition,&quot; says Audrey Jonckheer of American Express Co., which has been going after the new-grad market since 1978. Marketers say college graduates are good credit risks; those snagged early also often develop strong product loyalty.    So many students accepted a Toyota test-drive invitation that the company ran out of promotional T-shirts.    BRIEFS: A roadside sign near Callicoon, N.Y.: &quot;Disney World 1,657 Miles. Don's Yard Sale 3 Miles.&quot; . . . Room rates at top London hotels are down from an average of $150 a night last year to $95 this summer, says consultant Laventhol andamp; Horwath. </TEXT></DOC>
