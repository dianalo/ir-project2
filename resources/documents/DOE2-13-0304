The origin ofthe striking behaviour of the first excited O/sup +/-state as a functionof neutron number was searched for the theory of pairing vibrations isa poor approximation of the exact theory of pairing interactions in thecase of the Germanium isotopes under consideration. It was establishedthat the exact theory of pairing interactions in the neutron configurationalone is insufficient for a first order description of the experimentallydetermined first excited O/sup +/ energy levels. Diagonalisation of theHamiltonian for the pairing interaction in both the proton and neutronconfigurations in the subspace of states consisting only of nucleon pairscoupled to zero angular momentum, led to the desired energy eigenvaluesin the vicinity of the experimentally determined first excited O/sup+/ energy levels. In order to describe the complete set of low-lyingenergy levels in the Germanium isotopes, a s'-boson was introduced intothe interacting boson model-1 which usually involves only s- and d- bosons.The identification of the single particle energy of the s' boson withthe energy of the first excited O/sup +/ state obtained from the exactpairing interaction calculation is made. The energy spectra obtainedby diagonalising the Hamiltonian in the interacting boson model agreedwell with the experimentally determined energy spectra except for the/sup 76/Ge nucleus. Especially the first two excited O/sup +/ levelswere very well fitted.</TEXT></DOC>
