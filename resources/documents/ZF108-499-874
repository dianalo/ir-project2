(PSI) has created the power user's ultimate Legoset for disk controllers: the hyper-STORE-1600.andP;  Unlike most competitors,it's completely modular, so you can build just what you need.andM;Start with the base unit that carries a list price of $890 and you get afull-length XT-height card that has a floppy disk port but no memory and nodisk interfaces; these come on separate daughterboards that can be stacked ontop of each other.andP;  The base card does sport slots for four SIMMs, and has an80280 processor on-board.andP;  Since its SIMMs can be standard, you can get thememory you need from PSI or from other sources.andP;  The board is limited to 4MBof memory.andP;  The SCSI and ESDI adapters cost $405, the price of the RLLadapter is $335, and the MFM adapter costs $405.andP;  There is also a mirroringoption available for $295.andM;The hard disk interface comes on a daughterboard that mounts on the end ofthe card.andP;  Our tested configuration for the hyperSTORE carried a list priceof $1,695 (including memory supplied by PSI) and came with 2MB and an ESDIinterface that supports two hard disk drives.andP;  The unusual feature is thatyou can stack up to four disk interface cards on the base card.andP;  Since youcan daisy-chain up to seven SCSI drives off a single SCSI port, thehyperSTORE 1600 can drive as many as 28 SCSI drives at the same time.andM;Installation and setup were fairly straightforward.andP;  The documentation isfilled with clear illustrations, making it easy to identify the differentjumper locations and choose the correct setting.andP;  The trickiest step in theinstallation is running your computer's SETUP utility in order to change theCMOS setting so that it appears that there are no hard disks installed.andP;  Youmust complete this step before you can install the card.andM;You'll find the installation and low-level format utility has a fairlyintuitive interface.andP;  The card can be set to run in different modes,depending on whether you want more speed or better compatibility with theWestern Digital controller standard.andP;  You can also specify how extensive thesurface analysis will be during the format process.andP;  Once the formatting wascomplete, I was able to run the Compaq DOS 3.31 FDISK and FORMAT utilities tocreate a single 300MB drive.andM;The caching algorithm resides in software, which means users can upgradepainlessly.andP;  An announced BBS should make upgrading even easier.andM;In PC Labs' performance tests, the hyperSTORE-1600 turned in impressivetimes.andP;  It was rarely fastest, but it was usually near the top speed.andP;  ThehyperSTORE is engineered to run safely in expansion bus slots at speeds up to12.5 MHz; in some compatible systems that allow you to set bus speeds, thisoption permits even better performance.andM;PSI's controller provides good performance at a competitive price, but itsgreatest strength lies in its ability to change personalities and work withdifferent disks.andP;  This flexibility means that you don't have to changecontrollers to use a different disk interface, and in many cases you'll beable to keep the old drives even after you add the new ones-a unique approachto keeping your options open.andP;  * Alfred Poor is a contributing editor of PCMagazine.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
