Recent improvements in computer technology can providespeedy response to telephone inquiries and provide customerswith answers at any hour of the day or night. Developments in&quot;expert&quot; software systems and &quot;image processing&quot; shorten thegame of telephone tag and cut the number of times customercalls get shunted around from person to person. Improvementsin laptop computers are sending more companies'representatives into the field to speed the handling ofinsurance claims, mortgage applications, elevator repairs andeven cocktail orders.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Service is becoming the determining factor formaintaining competitiveness in more and more businesses,&quot;says William Davidow, a venture capitalist and co-author of&quot;Total Customer Service, the Ultimate Weapon.&quot; And, althoughservice is widely considered to be so bad that the recentdevelopments can hardly be a panacea, companies are findingthat some of the improvements can give them an advantage overtheir competitors.   Among the biggest breakthroughs have been systems that lettelephone switches and standard computers speak the samelanguage. That means someone calling with a question on, say,a credit-card bill can punch in an account number while onhold. The telephone switch would relay the number to thecomputer, which would fetch the caller's records. The recordswould be relayed back through the phone switch and wouldappear on the customer-service person's computer screen assoon as he answered the call.   Lee Figliuolo, a vice president at Progressive CasualtyInsurance Co., Cleveland, says such hybrid systems can beespecially important for callers when they get passed fromone person to another. The records simply become part of thecall. When the call is transferred, the files appear on thecomputer terminal of the service representative who grabs it,so the information doesn't have to be taken down all overagain.   &quot;As the customer, I'm not repeating my account number orname,&quot; Mr. Figliuolo says. &quot;And with a name like mine, Ialways have to spell it three or four times.&quot;   Mr. Figliuolo, who recently installed an InternationalBusiness Machines Corp. CallPath system at his company, saysthe system also makes it easier to reroute phone calls.Callers after business hours on the East Coast used to get arecorded message, but now they're shifted to the West Coastand answered by someone there. Moreover, the computersautomatically track all sorts of indicators -- how long thecaller was on hold, how many times he was transferred, etc.-- so problem areas can be spotted quickly.   Using such systems, callers can get information onaccounts and so forth at any time, without waiting for anoperator. St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center inPhoenix, Ariz., installed a system so that patients can getinformation on bills by calling a computer and punching intheir account numbers. The system will also soon givephysicians their lab results.   Similarly, Thomas Powell andamp; Associates, a software firm inBoca Raton, Fla., that specializes in voice systems, recentlyunveiled a system that lets golfers reserve tee-off times bydialing a computer and following the voice prompts.   Image processing -- where documents are scanned by acomputer and stored electronically -- is also becoming widelyused to cut the time a customer spends on the phone with acompany.   A study by the Nolan Norton Institute, a research firm inLexington, Mass., found that, with image processing,companies can more than halve the time it takes to respond toan inquiry, because pulling files together electronically isso much faster than fetching them from drawers. The studysays a big insurance company cut to 10 days from more thansix months the time it took to resolve complex claims. Amanufacturing company cut the parts-reordering process to anaverage of three minutes from 20.   Philip LaKernick, chief executive of Maria Parham Hospitalin Henderson, N.C., says a new system from GeneSys DataTechnologies Inc. of Hunt Valley, Md., has cut the time ittakes to find a patient's chart to less than a minute fromhalf an hour. He says that's important in the middle of thenight, when nurses assume the task because medical-recordspeople aren't there 24 hours a day. He adds that the systemcan be crucial in the emergency room, making medicalhistories readily available.   Some companies are also beginning to use &quot;expert&quot; systems-- which collect knowledge -- to help answer customers'questions, especially on technical matters. Turnover incustomer-service operations can be high, and it can take along time to bring a new person up to speed, so companies usethe software systems to store answers as people uncover themand build a base of expertise that won't walk out the doorwhen an employee does.   &quot;We can often answer a question on the first call,&quot; saysRandy Fisher, vice president of customer support at InterleafInc., a software company that recently began using a systemfrom Answer Computer Inc., in Sunnyvale, Calif. In the past,he says, whoever answered the call might well have gone offresearching what someone else had already done.   Otis Elevator Co., a subsidiary of United TechnologiesCorp., is using an expert system, together with laptopcomputers, to speed repair. Otis has devices that, workinglike airplane flight recorders, collect information on thebehavior of many of its elevators. When an elevator isn'tworking, an expert system provides a list of possibleproblems, which the repairman can call up on his portablecomputer. Otis is also testing a system that would let himcall up the elevator's maintenance history.   As laptops have shrunk, systems such as NCR Corp.'s&quot;palmtop&quot; order-entry system also have become available. Thecomputer lets a waiter take an order at a table andimmediately send it over a radio frequency to the bar orkitchen, trimming the time people have to spend waiting forthat hard-earned first drink and those appetizers.   The march of technology isn't always seen as progress, ofcourse. Customers frequently complain about reaching acomputer when they're trying to call a company. Customers mayalso get a sales pitch when they call for service, given thatconsolidated data on the customer can alert the company towhat products a caller might need. Also, people whoappreciate being able to get a tee time late some nightwouldn't necessarily like having to walk through the sameseries of voice prompts in the middle of the afternoon.   In many instances, however, these technologies really willsave customers a minute here, an hour there, maybe even a dayor two someplace else.</TEXT></DOC>
