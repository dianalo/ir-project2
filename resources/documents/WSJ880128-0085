Lenders and other industry participants in the program predict a sharp cutback in loans under the program unless they can reach a compromise or obtain a delay of an Education Department decision on the rules, expected by Feb. 1.    The guaranteed loan program provides about $10 billion a year in loans, or about half of all college-student financial aid in the country.    The Education Department's new rules may cause losses for banks and others who hold the loans. The rules also stand to increase tension between educators and the department, which wants to curtail the progam because of its high default rates.    The rules were adopted because the department believed some lenders weren't trying hard enough to collect student loans. The rules tighten collection procedures that must be followed before a lender can make a default claim to one of the 47 state and multi-state agencies that act as first guarantors of the loans. Under normal circumstances, the Education Department reimburses the agencies for the defaulted loans.    Fearing the department will deny payments for loans in cases where lenders haven't followed the new collection rules, many of the agencies have denied the lenders' claims. Others have continued making payments in such cases, risking federal rejection, while lenders and agencies scramble to negotiate a compromise.    The rules cover loans on which payments were first missed last March. Substantial numbers of claims began being denied in October, when the Education Department reaffirmed its position to several of the larger agencies, including New York.    The department has been promising the industry a letter to agencies by Feb. 1 that would set final guidelines for resubmitting the rejected claims. It would also allow the agencies to make payments on loan claims they have delayed because of the rules. But after a meeting of industry officials and the Education Department yesterday, lenders aren't hopeful that the letter will solve the problem.    &quot;This is endangering the viability of the program,&quot; says John E. Dean, an attorney representing the Consumer Bankers Association in the negotiations.    &quot;A lender doesn't want to make a guaranteed loan when the guarantee is at risk,&quot; adds Richard Hawk, chairman of the Higher Education Assistance Foundation, a multi-state guarantor in Overland Park, Kan.    Big lenders in the program include Citicorp's Citibank, Florida Federal Savings andamp; Loan, Wells Fargo andamp; Co.'s Wells Fargo Bank, and Chemical New York Corp.'s Chemical Bank. The largest holder is the Student Loan Marketing Association, or Sallie Mae, which buys loans from lenders and holds $10 billion of the $43 billion outstanding.    Victoria Tripp, an Education Department spokeswoman, said that &quot;the only thing&quot; still separating the department and the industry is &quot;their idea that all rejected claims should be curable. We obviously can't give in on that, or why have (collection) rules at all?&quot;    The amount of defaulted loans put at risk by the rules so far isn't exactly known. The National Council of Higher Education Loan Programs, a trade group for loan agencies, estimates the figure to be between $200 million and $400 million.    Some program participants, however, say the figure may already be higher, and will grow rapidly as more claims are made. The Education Department predicts $1.6 billion in defaults in the federal fiscal year ending next Sept. 30, up about 20% from last year.    Robert Butler, a spokesman for the New York State Higher Education Services Corp., says the agency is rejecting half of all claims submitted under the new rules. Since October, he says, the agency has turned away 4,500 claims worth $15 million. The California Student Aid Commission says it has returned up to 5,000 claims worth $15 million.    Sources at both agencies say that Citibank, the largest bank in the program, has had one of the largest numbers of returned claims. A spokesman for the bank acknowledged that claims have been returned, but said: &quot;We do not have a substantial problem.&quot; So far, the Consumer Bankers Association says banks have not had to provide reserves against loan losses because the Education Department hasn't made a final ruling. </TEXT></DOC>
