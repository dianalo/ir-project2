L. 100-690. Section 2405 of this act mandated theDrug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the U.S. Environmental ProtectionAgency (USEPA) to form a joint Federal Task Force to formulate, establish,and implement a program for the cleanup and disposal of hazardous wasteproduced by illegal drug laboratories. The law also required the Task Forceto develop and disseminate guidelines to law enforcement agencies thathave responsibility for the enforcement of drug laws. After the final guidelinesare published and disseminated, the Attorney General shall make grantsto, and enter into contracts with, state and local governments, who agreeto comply with the guidelines, for demonstration projects to clean up andsafely dispose of substances associated with illegal drug laboratorieswhich may present a danger to public health and the environment. The proposedguidelines are now available for review by state and local agencies andany other interested parties. A 90-day period has been established to allowfor comments, prior to developing and publishing the final guidelines.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Comments must be submitted by August 22, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Requests for copies of the proposed guidelines and commentsshould be addressed to: Sidney A.

The laboratories range from crude makeshift operationsto highly sophisticated and technically advanced enterprises. The numberof clandestine drug laboratory seizures is increasing. In 1981, the DEAseized 184 clandestine drug laboratories. In contrast, 810 laboratorieswere seized in 1988. A clandestine laboratory investigation is unique and presents many safetyand health hazards. The indiscriminate disposal of hazardous waste by theoutlaw laboratory operator to avoid detection may lead to contaminationof surrounding water sources, soil, and air as well as the building andits fixtures. Many different toxic chemicals are used in illegal drug manufacturing.As a result, the type and scope of chemical hazards that law enforcementofficials, local populations and the environment may be exposed to areextremely diverse. Cleanup actions at these laboratory sites, includingthe immediate or planned removal of bulk chemicals and contaminated materials,are necessary to prevent harm to the public health and welfare and theenvironment. These complex issues, along with growing public environmentalawareness and regulations promulgated by the U.S. Environmental ProtectionAgency (USEPA) and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA),require specialized training and medical programs for, and use of protectiveraid garments by law enforcement personnel involved in clandestine druglaboratory seizures. The overall program implementation requires cooperationbetween law enforcement and health/environmental entities to protect publichealth and the environment. Currently, there are no Federal guidance documents that address the uniqueproblems associated with clandestine drug laboratories. These proposedguidelines have integrated the experience of DEA field Special Agents andForensic Chemists and USEPA Emergency Response Technicians, various guidancedocuments developed by USEPA for cleaning up hazardous waste sites andhealth and safety programs established by DEA, USEPA and OSHA. The guidelines suggest that state and local law enforcement and environmentaland health agencies implement a comprehensive approach to clandestine laboratorycleanup. The guidelines also outline measures which can be taken to reducethe hazards associated with clandestine drug laboratories and providesinformation on relevant and applicable hazardous waste statutes and regulations,such as the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which may applyto clean up activities at clandestine drug laboratories. The guidelines contain information on: Chemicals commonly found at druglaboratory sites, DEA clandestine laboratory safety certification programsand personnel medical requirements for participation in the clandestinedrug laboratory program. Sample forms such as contamination reports anduniform hazardous waste manifests for transporting hazardous waste, andadditional information that may be used to develop state or local clandestinedrug laboratory cleanup programs, are included. The comment period will enable state and local governments an opportunityto review and comment on the proposed guidelines, which will assist theTask Force in developing final guidelines. <ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: May 18, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">John C.
