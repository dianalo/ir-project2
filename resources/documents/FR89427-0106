TS have been proposed for the following:(1) Post-Accident Sampling, (2) Sampling and Analysis of Plant Effluents,(3) Containment Pressure Monitor, (4) Reactor Coolant System Vents, (5)Noble Gas Effluent, (6) Containment High-Range Radiation Monitor, and (7)Instrumentation for Detection of Inadequate Core Cooling.The proposed action is in accordance with the licensee's application foramendment dated July 1, 1988 with revisions by letters dated December 2,1988 and March 1, 1989.The Need for the Proposed ActionThe proposed change to the TS is required in order for the licensee tocomply with Generic Letter (GL) 83-37, ``NUREG-0737 Technical Specifications,''dated November 1, 1983.Environmental Impacts of the Proposed ActionThe Commission has completed its evaluation of the proposed revisions tothe TS. The proposed revisions would provide TS for those items identifiedin NUREG-0737, ``Clarification of TMI Action Plan Requirements,'' as requiringTS. TS have been proposed for all items found applicable to Haddam Neckper GL-83-37 except Long Term Auxiliary Feedwater System Evaluation (II.E.1.1),Containment Water Level Monitor (II.F.1.5), Containment Hydrogen Monitor(II.F.1.6) and Control Room Habitability Requirements (II.D.3.4). The TSfor these items will be resolved in other programs such as the IntegratedSafety Assessment Program (ISAP) and the TS Upgrade Program. The additionof these new TS and revisions to certain existing TS would not increasethe probability or consequences of accidents, no changes are being madein the types of any effluents that may be released offsite, and there isno significant increase in the allowable individual or cumulative occupationalradiation exposure. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that this actionwould result in no significant impact.With regard to potential non-radiological impacts, the proposed changesto the TS involve systems located within the restricted area as definedin 10 CFR Part 20. It does not affect non-radiological plant effluentsand has no other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission concludesthat there are no significant non-radiological environmental impacts associatedwith the proposed amendment.The Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment and Opportunity forHearing in connection with this action was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on November 2, 1988 (53 FR 44263). No requestfor hearing or petition for leave to intervene was filed following thisnotice.Alternative to the Proposed ActionIt has been determined that there is no measurable impact associated withthe proposed amendment; any alternatives to the amendment will have eitherno environmental impact or greater environmental impact.Alternative Use of ResourcesThis action does not involve the use of any resources beyond the scopeof resources used during normal operation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Finding of No Significant Impact</ITAG>Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, the Commission concludedthat the proposed action will not have a significant effect on the qualityof the human environment. Accordingly, the Commission has determined notto prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed license amendment.For further details with respect to this action, see the request for amendmentdated July 1, 1988 with revisions dated December 2, 1988 and March 1, 1989.Copies of the request for amendment are available for public inspectionat the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street,NW., Washington, DC and at the Russell Library, 123 Broad Street, Middletown,Connecticut.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 20th day of April 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">John F.
