Some of the 19 Western European countries signaled a&quot;breakthrough&quot; for the planned European Economic Area,composed of the 12 European Community members, the sixEuropean Free Trade Association members and an EFTAaffiliate. But Switzerland, worried about its 700-yeartradition of independence and isolationism, refused toendorse fully the latest blueprint. The preliminary textstill has many big holes, and negotiators said talks couldget even tougher.   Meanwhile, the richer EC nations rebuffed Spain's demandsfor a new fund to channel more money to the bloc's poorermembers. They said the fund shouldn't be included in a newtreaty the EC is drawing up for a political and economicunion.   Israel asked the EC states for trade concessions and tohelp end the Arab boycott against companies doing businesswith the country, which has a chronic trade deficit with theEC.                                                                                                          MASTERPIECES SPARED FROM FIRE                                                                                                          Ryoei Saito, a Japanese millionaire who ordered two artmasterpieces to be cremated with him after he dies, recanted.Mr. Saito, 75 years old, last year bought Vincent van Gogh's&quot;Portrait of Dr. Gachet&quot; for a record $82.5 million andPierre Auguste Renoir's &quot;Au Moulin de la Galette&quot; for $78.1million. Though Mr. Saito may have signaled his deepattachment to his art by planning ultimately to take it withhim, he quelled the resulting widespread outcry by vowing tohave the paintings stored instead.                                                                                                          GERMANY CLEARS TAX INCREASES                                                                                                          Parliament approved tax increases to help defray Germanunification costs without further expanding budget deficits.The package, which includes higher taxes on incomes, naturalgas, gasoline, heating oil, tobacco and insurance, will takeeffect July 1. It will generate 17 billion marks ($9.93billion) this year and 27 billion marks next year.                                                                                                          INVESTING IN HUNGARY CLEARED                                                                                                          Hungary's parliament approved a landmark measure onconcessions to attract foreign investment to help improve thecountry's infrastructure. The move, among efforts toward amarket economy, allows granting concessions for five to 35years in telecommunications, transportation, mining,utilities, oil and natural gas, postal services, gambling,and radio and television.                                                                                                          EX-ITALIAN COMMUNISTS OVERTAKEN                                                                                                          Italian voters dealt a blow to the former Communist Partyin its debut under a new name, the Democratic Party of theLeft, in scattered local elections. Former Premier BettinoCraxi's Socialists, previously the No. 3 party, overtook theDemocratic Left. The Communists changed their name in Januaryand dropped the hammer-and-sickle symbol in a bid to halt aslide in popularity and respond to Eastern Europeancommunism's collapse. Hard-liners created the CommunistRe-Formation Party.                                                                                                          SWISS VOW ON MARCOS DEPOSITS                                                                                                          Switzerland is prepared to surrender cash believed kept inSwiss banks by former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos,but Manila must first prove the late Mr. Marcos amassed themoney illegally, Swiss State Secretary for Foreign AffairsKlaus Jacobi said. He discussed with Manila officials theirefforts to recover an estimated $350 million in Marcosdeposits in Zurich banks. Manila believes the Marcos familymay have stashed as much as $5 billion in Swiss banks.                                                                                                          SOVIET TV LOSES ITS MONOPOLY                                                                                                          The Russian republic irreverently broke the Kremlin'stelevision monopoly by opening a channel that broadcast hardnews and satire, including a comedian who mocked SovietPresident Mikhail Gorbachev.   Boris Yeltsin, the Russian federation's leader, hadcomplained that Soviet-controlled TV effectively imposed an&quot;information blockade&quot; on his republic. That all changed whenthe All-Russian Committee for Radio and Television that Mr.Yeltsin founded last year offered its first night of regularprogramming on Monday.   Mr. Yeltsin had criticized Leonid Kravchenko, the head ofCentral Television, for canceling &quot;Viewpoint,&quot; a popular showwith investigative journalism and reformist commentaries, andfor banning from live TV three popular anchors of alate-night newscast. Mr. Kravchenko has said state-ownedmedia should speak with a single voice.   The new Russian Television and Radio, or RTR, initiallywill broadcast about six hours daily on the Soviet Union'ssecond channel, including two 15-minute newscasts andcultural, entertainment and political shows. It can bereceived by about 75% of all Soviet citizens.                                                                                                          POSTSCRIPTS . . .                                                                                                          Beijing hopes to cash in on the craze for karaoke, orJapanese-style sing-along, by producing hundreds ofideologically sound videos by July 1, the Chinese CommunistParty's 70th anniversary, the South China Morning Post said.Titles include &quot;Our Leader, Mao Tse-tung.&quot; . . . Thebirthplace of Karen Blixen, the Danish author of &quot;Out ofAfrica&quot; who used the pseudonym Isak Dinesen, was opened as amuseum in Rungsted, 12 miles north of Copenhagen. She diedthere at 77 in 1962.</TEXT></DOC>
