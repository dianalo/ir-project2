There has been a reportthat during production there was insufficient electrical bonding betweenthe engine firex bottle cartridge and the airplane structure. This condition,if not corrected, could result in the inability to actuate the fire extinguisherbottle when needed.Airbus Industrie has issued All Operator Telex (AOT) 26/88/01, which describesprocedures for inspecting the engine fire extinguisher bottles for electricalbonding defects, and repair, if necessary. The DGAC has classified AOT26/88/01 as mandatory and has issued Airworthiness Directive 88-181-089(B)addressing this subject.These airplane models are manufactured in France and type certificatedin the United States under the provisions of Section 21.29 of the FederalAviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement.Since this condition is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes ofthe same type design registered in the United States, this AD requiresinspection of the engine fire extinguisher bottles for an electrical bondingdefect, and repair, if necessary, in accordance with the Airbus All OperatorTelex described above.Since a condition exists that requires immediate adoption of this regulation,it is found that notice and public procedure hereon are impracticable,and good cause exists for making this amendment effective in less than30 days.The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effectson the states, on the relationship between the national government andthe states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficientfederalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulationand that it is not considered to be major under Executive Order 12291.It is impracticable for the agency to follow the procedures of Order 12291with respect to this rule since the rule must be issued immediately tocorrect an unsafe condition in aircraft. It has been further determinedthat this document involves an emergency regulation under DOT RegulatoryPolicies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). If this actionis subsequently determined to involve a significant/major regulation, afinal regulatory evaluation or analysis, as appropriate, will be preparedand placed in the regulatory docket (otherwise, an evaluation is not required).<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39</ITAG>Aviation safety, Aircraft.<ITAG tagnum="84">Adoption of the Amendment</ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator,the Federal Aviation Administration amends andSection; 39.13 of Part 39 ofthe Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 39.13) as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 39_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
