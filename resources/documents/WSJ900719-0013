He notes that the president couldtake new taxes off the table if he doesn't reach a budgetagreement with Congress. National Small Business United callsMr. Bush's move &quot;necessary and responsible&quot; to get thedeficit and interest rates under control. Small-businessgroups still want a cut in capital gains tax rates to be partof any budget package.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;I just hope he trades that for something,&quot; J. W. Kisling,chairman of the small manufacturers council of the NationalAssociation of Manufacturers, says of Mr. Bush's pull-backfrom his no-new-taxes pledge. Small businesses say newbroad-based energy taxes would hurt more than an excise tax.They argue that changing tax rates or charging businessesenvironmental or energy taxes could damp a recent push amongsmall manufacturers to export and be more competitive.   Interest in exporting has doubled among smallmanufacturers, who see it as a new source of growth in asluggish U.S. economy, Mr. Kisling says.   ---   ENABLING THE DISABLED: Small firms get advice on thedisability law.   Several groups focus on helping smaller companies complywith the Americans with Disabilities Act passed by Congresslast week barring discrimination in the hiring and serving ofthe disabled. Phone calls seeking compliance guidance fromthe Job Accommodation Network, part of the President'sCommittee on the Disabled, and Mainstream Inc., a nonprofitgroup, have increased about 20% in the last month. Even moreinquiries are anticipated once President Bush signs the billinto law, as expected. The groups' advice still is generalbecause regulations governing the law probably won't becompleted for another year.   Most small storefront businesses can begin by installingramps or widening doors for wheelchair users, the groups say.An easy way to widen a doorway is by applying &quot;swing clearhinges&quot; that let a door swing back beyond a 90-degree anglewhen open, says the federal Architectural and TransportationBarriers and Compliance Board. While some computer equipmentfor disabled workers is expensive, &quot;most state vocationalrehabilitation organizations will pay all or part of the costto help a company or an individual,&quot; says Larry Pencak,Mainstream's executive director.   The Small Business Legislative Council holds a seminarthis week on complying with the law, and the NationalRestaurant Association plans a symposium in January.   ---   FALLING SHORT: The Federal Reserve Board's action lastweek easing the rate banks charge each other for loans was&quot;too little, too late, and won't have any major effect on theinterest rates impacting small manufacturers,&quot; says JerryJasinowski, president of the National Association ofManufacturers. He urges more aggressive efforts to bring downthe prime lending rate. Last month, a survey of the NAM'ssmall and medium-sized members showed that a third of themare finding it more difficult to obtain credit. Mr.Jasinowski says the tone of the responses reflected even moreconcern about the economy's slow growth.   ---   TO PAY OR NOT TO PAY the expenses of delegates whootherwise couldn't afford to attend the proposed White HouseConference on Small Business is the question the House SmallBusiness Committee will debate next week. Rep. Neal Smith,(D., Iowa), argues that without a subsidy, the 1994 meetingcould be controlled by the organized small-business lobbyinggroups. Other committee members say the offer will encouragethose who can afford the expense to claim they can't. TheSenate Small Business Committee hasn't considered a bill onthe conference.   ---   ENTREPRENEURS studying Eastern Europe to get a boost fromCongress.   Lawmakers are moving to help such business owners with anew version of the Support for Eastern European Democraciesbill (SEED II). The legislation would establish at least twoAmerican business centers in Eastern Europe to providetranslation and telecommunications services and marketresearch for smaller concerns. Poland and Czechoslovakia arelikely candidates for the first two centers, which areexpected to cost from $3 million to $5 million apiece toestablish, Senate staff members say.   SEED II would also reauthorize a fund to provide venturecapital and loans for U.S. business projects, especiallyjoint ventures, in Eastern Europe. The first so-calledenterprise fund was aimed only at Poland and Hungary. &quot;Thisbill is designed to stimulate a program that's been slow toget off the ground,&quot; says Sen. Claiborne Pell (D., R.I.), oneof the bill's sponsors. The Senate Foreign RelationsCommittee is expected to vote on the measure in the next fewdays, and quick congressional approval is anticipated.   In addition, the Small Business Administration says itwill recruit American small business owners to help trainEast European entrepreneurs during six-week internships inthe U.S.   ---   SMALL TALK: With no new nominee on the horizon to head theSBA's Advocacy Office, Mark Hayward, the agency's liaisonwith state and local governments and a former mayor of EastProvidence, R.I., takes on the job until the Senate approvesa permanent boss. . . .
