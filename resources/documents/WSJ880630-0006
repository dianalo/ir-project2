But the way he is going about it may well tie the country up in a new tangle.    In unveiling his reform proposals this week, Mr. Gorbachev refused to allow competing parties as a way to curb the clout and corruption of Communist Party leaders. Instead, he proposed constitutional reform that would transfer the party's administrative functions to a president and a fulltime, 2,250-member parliament indirectly elected by all Soviet citizens, not just party members. The party would be relegated to initiating policy direction but not actually implementing policy.    By refusing to address head-on the central issue of the Communist Party's monopoly of political power, the Soviet leader's hopes of reforming the political system -- thereby enhancing prospects for a smoother functioning of the economy -- are at best likely to fall short of his high expectations. At worst, they will go the way of previous Soviet reform efforts: nowhere.    Significantly, one of the leading reform economists, Leonid Abalkin, publicly criticized Mr. Gorbachev's proposals within hours of their announcement Tuesday at a landmark party conference, where Mr. Gorbachev hopes to get endorsement for some of his ideas. And one seasoned Marxist political observer, weary of the constant talk of change, says: &quot;Constitutional reform isn't going to alter anything.&quot;    Regardless, Mr. Gorbachev apparently has high hopes that separating party and state functions will make the economy function better. The system he has come up with seems to be the best he can do for now, given that he lacks complete support among his party colleagues for more sweeping political reform.    But, for all its good intentions, Mr. Gorbachev's proposed separation of state and party is blurred by a crucial ambiguity. Because the party won't relinquish any power, General-Secretary Gorbachev, the party chief, will almost certainly also become President Gorbachev, the head of state. The overlap will be repeated throughout the system, with local party leaders being nominated as chairmen of local elected state councils.    Mr. Gorbachev says the overlap of functions is good because it will give the state councils prestige and generally &quot;improve all aspects of their work.&quot; But the prospect of a continued link between party and state in overseeing the economy strikes fear in the hearts of reform economists and enterprising factory managers, who have long fought against petty interference by local party bosses.    The Soviet media have been filled with stories about how the plans of budding entrepreneurs were thwarted by party secretaries who burden the firms with red tape or even refuse to authorize their operations. Many had hoped Mr. Gorbachev's political reforms would free firms from such meddling by entirely removing the party from economic management. Instead, he is institutionalizing the link.    &quot;This new idea will hardly fit into the concept of limiting the functions of party and government bodies,&quot; Mr. Abalkin, the economist, told the party conference. He said he had &quot;serious doubts&quot; about the new system, the Soviet news agency Tass reported.    In Mr. Gorbachev's New Efficient World, party secretaries are supposed to be responsible, serious-minded people who will resist the temptation to interfere. To make the process seem more democratic, they will have to be elected to the state bodies by secret ballot from among several candidates. But it isn't clear what would happen in the unlikely event that the local party boss, let alone Mr. Gorbachev, isn't chosen. &quot;If that is the case, the party committee and the Communists will obviously have to draw the necessary conclusions,&quot; Mr. Gorbachev said vaguely.    It would be too much to expect Mr. Gorbachev to willingly give ground on the central issue of party power in order to bring about a comprehensive, clear-cut separation of party and state. No matter how much the Communist Party and its ideology seem to be changing under Mr. Gorbachev, challenging the party's &quot;leading role&quot; remains taboo.    &quot;How many parties do you want?&quot; Politburo member Alexander Yakovlev replied heatedly when asked about the oneparty system at a news conference. Describing the U.S. two-party system as &quot;lots of games, showmanship,&quot; he firmly ruled out any alternative to the Soviet Communist Party, which &quot;can embrace under a single umbrella most of the country's population.&quot;    Tragically for the Soviet Union, the diversity of party membership hasn't proved enough to check previous abuses of power. In August 1936, just two months after the Soviet leadership approved a new constitution that Josef Stalin called &quot;the most democratic in the world,&quot; the first of Stalin's bloody show trials took place that ultimately led to the deaths and imprisonment of millions of Soviet citizens. </TEXT></DOC>
