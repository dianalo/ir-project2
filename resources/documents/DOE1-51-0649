The frameworklinks models of pollutant emissions; atmospheric conversion and transport;acidic deposition; lake acidification; fish viability; forest productivity;and damages to selected man-made materials. These models are nominallyderived from more detailed models and data which represent the currentstate of science in each area. Simpler models, including representationsof expert judgment, also can be employed. A comparative economic frameworkis established through the incorporation of user-specified valuationrelationships, and cost models for emission controls and impact mitigation.The framework is designed to allow alternate assumptions or hypothesesto be easily tested in interactive fashion for preliminary assessmentpurposes and research management. The framework is implemented in a softwaresystem designed to facilitate the analysis of model and parameter uncertainties.An interactive menu-based interface also has been developed to facilitateuse of the model. The model's use for assessment purposes is illustrated,and plans for its continued development are described.</TEXT></DOC>
