But many who try it discover that one of the best waysto soften the shock is to turn their old employers intoassets.   For instance, after 32 years at International BusinessMachines Corp., Robert Bettendorf accepted anearly-retirement offer last year. He started his ownbusiness, but he hasn't stopped doing work for IBM. Instead,he made the computer giant his first client.</LP><TEXT>   In his last IBM job, Mr. Bettendorf ran an office thatconcentrated on the safety and comfort of IBM products. IBMhired his new concern, Institute of Office Technology Inc.,Stamford, Conn., to study the health effects of officeequipment. &quot;I was creating a gap at the company which I wasable to fill,&quot; he explains.   Mr. Bettendorf knew before he started his company that hewould get some work from IBM. &quot;Without those assurances, Imight well have gone out and done something else.&quot; IBM stillaccounts for more than 50% of his business, but he hopes toreduce his dependency on the corporation through acombination of seminars and independent consultingassignments.   Many executives at big companies such as IBM yearn tostart their own businesses. In addition, recent mergers,acquisitions and cutbacks at companies have forced numerousothers to start new careers. Increasingly, they chooseself-employment. Joseph Jannotta, chairman of Jannotta, Brayandamp; Associates, an executive placement firm in Chicago, saysthat 16% of the laid-off employees whom his firm helps findwork end up as entrepreneurs, compared with only 4% in 1980.   New entrepreneurs frequently find there are many ways thattheir old employers can help them in new ventures. TakeHarlan Jessup, who has left General Electric Co. twice.   In 1979, a midlife crisis led him to open a sporting-goodsretail store in Southbury, Conn. The venture failed, and Mr.Jessup was back with GE by March 1980. On New Year's Day thisyear, Mr. Jessup was on his own again. But this time hecouldn't turn back: His division was being phased out. LikeMr. Bettendorf, he started his own business and turned hisold company into his first client.   But this was just the beginning. More importantly, hesays, GE allowed him to use the training materials he haddeveloped while he worked at the company. These form anessential part of the service that his consulting concern,TeamWork Management, offers. &quot;Developing new materials wouldhave been an overwhelming task,&quot; he says.   GE also allowed Mr. Jessup to spend the three monthsbetween accepting the early-retirement program and leaving GEon developing his new business. He printed a brochure anddeveloped a mailing-list during that time. Mr. Jessup nowoperates his business from his home in Newtown, Conn.,helping to develop &quot;self-directed work teams&quot; -- groups ofemployees that plan and measure their own work -- for fourdivisions of GE.   Now Mr. Jessup is looking to expand his client base. Hethinks he can achieve this through a series of publicworkshops he has planned for the end of the year.   Of course, entrepreneurs who turn employers into clientsrealize they can become too dependent on a single company.The relationship can have other pitfalls, too, warn businessowners such as Jeffrey Hartnell. He left Ross Laboratories, aunit of Abbott Laboratories Inc., to buy into an advertisingagency that now works predominantly for pharmaceuticalcompanies. He believes that &quot;once you leave your employer'sdoor, you have to be careful about how you come back andknock on it.&quot;   Mr. Hartnell says that after he left Ross in 1986, he wasafraid of becoming involved in questions of confidentiality.For two years, therefore, he steered clear of the areas hehad specialized in while an employee of Ross, working insteadfor packaged-goods pharmaceutical concerns.   Now his agency, Martcom Inc., does 20 to 25 projects ayear for Ross. &quot;They can be confident now that I won't be asecurity problem for them,&quot; he says.   While many departing employees find ways to get help fromtheir old employers, the companies sometimes take theinitiative, too. For five years before retirement and threeyears afterward, IBM employees are eligible for reimbursementof as much as $5,000 for the cost of education. Someemployees have used the plan to take courses in subjects suchas accounting, which help them in starting up their ownbusinesses, says Kenneth Johnson, manager of the retirementand capital accumulation programs at IBM.   Sometimes, companies even provide employees with thebusiness itself. When Allied-Signal Inc. decided to disbandits corporate new ventures group in July 1986, it couldn'tfind a place for one venture that it had been developing foralmost 10 years. So it offered the unit to a group ofemployees led by Stephen Fields, who had been developing itsmain product for several years, time-sensitive andtemperature-sensitive labels for food products. Alliedoffered to pay Mr. Fields and five other employees theirregular salaries while they raised the necessary money.   One year later, in August 1987, Allied-Signal sold theunit, now called LifeLines Technology Inc., for $2 million toa consortium consisting of venture capital groups, the sixemployees and Allied-Signal.   Mr. Fields says going out on his own would have beenimpossible without the support of Allied-Signal, which hascontinued to provide funding. Besides, he says, &quot;this isn'tthe kind of business you could start from scratch.&quot; He claimsthat the almost 10 years of research into the innovativeproduct wouldn't have been possible outside of a corporation.   Mr. Fields says entrepreneurship suits him fine. &quot;I get tocontrol my destiny to a much greater extent than I would in acorporation,&quot; he says. He thinks that the entrepreneurialapproach also makes the company run more effectively, too.&quot;We're all trying to make money, so there's a realsingularity of purpose.&quot;   On top of all this, Mr. Fields says the new owners havesince received offers of more than $10 million for thecompany.</TEXT></DOC>
