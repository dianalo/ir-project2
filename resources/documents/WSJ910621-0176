To finance the fleet renewal program, Instituto Nacionalde Industria, the state-owned holding company and Iberia'smajor shareholder, will inject financing into the airlinethrough a capital increase.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Aguilo said the government turned down Iberia'srequest for a subsidy of 30 billion pesetas ($265.3 million)to help the company weather heavy losses. He declined todisclose the amount or the terms of the planned capitalincrease.   But he said Iberia has agreed to stretch out payments for16 Boeing 757s, 24 McDonnell Douglas MD-87s, and 38 AirbusA-320s, A-321s and A-340s under order as part of thecompany's fleet renewal program, which will cost 400 billionpesetas. The rescheduling, he said, will help relieve thecarrier's financial burden.   In addition, deliveries of eight of the Boeing 757s willbe delayed two years, while deliveries of nine Airbus jetswill be pushed back one or two years. All of the aircraftwill be delivered before 1997, he said.   Because of a steep drop in air traffic and higher fuelprices during the Persian Gulf crisis, Iberia posted anoperating loss of 26.1 billion pesetas for 1990. The companyhad a loss of 14 billion pesetas last year and Mr. Aguilosaid he expects the loss to widen in 1991 as a result of theslow recovery in air traffic and a series of labor disputesearlier this year.   Mr. Aguilo said Iberia will unveil next month a plan tohalt losses and correct the company's structural flaws. Theplan, he said, is aimed at increasing Iberia's presenceabroad, particularly in Latin America, where the company'scompetitive edge can offset a loss of market share in Europe.The plan will also focus on improving service andproductivity, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
