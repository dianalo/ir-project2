By Thursday night, the virus had infected hundreds of computerson what one expert said was the largest scale ever, but authoritiessaid it apparently destroyed no data even though it temporarilyhalted some research.   Viruses are tiny programs introduced to computers either as aprank or vandalism. They can attach themselves to other programs andspread through shared software or ``electronic mail'' systems thatlink computers.   Mild viruses may flash a message on a user's screen, while``deadly'' forms can destroy data or cripple a computer. This virusapparently did its damage by rapidly duplicating itself, therebyslowing computers' processing speed and taking up their memory space.</TEXT><DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos sayshe feels ``betrayed'' by the American system but will comply with ajudge's order in his federal racketeering case and ``take mydestiny, whatever that may be.''   ``I am not afraid to go to jail,'' Marcos told The AssociatedPress in an exclusive interview at his home here Thursday. ``I wouldprobably be dead by the time the trial is over. I'm feeling in painevery day.''

A 32-page document filed Thursday in U.S. District Judge LuciusBunton's court contains affidavits from three Hispanic agents whocontend they have been singled out and treated unfairly since Buntonruled Sept. 30 that the FBI discriminates against Hispanics inpromotions and job conditions.   FBI spokesman Gregory Jones in Washington denied the allegations,saying ``any intimidation or retaliation would be illegal andintolerable, and would result in an FBI inquiry.''   Bernardo ``Matt'' Perez, who initiated the class-action lawsuitin January 1987, contended in his affidavit that many of his dutiesas No. 2 man in the El Paso office have been taken away, and thathis boss has intimidated another agent for talking to reportersabout the case.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Federal prosecutors have indicated that defenseconsultant William Parkin will be among the first people charged inthe massive Pentagon bribery case, a source says.   The source, speaking Thursday on condition of anonymity, saidParkin has been told he ``will be indicted unless he comes in andcuts a deal, which he is not going to do.''   Parkin has told reporters that he believes he broke no laws inrunning his Alexandria, Va., consulting business. Although thesource would not reveal details of the plea bargain offer, he saidthe terms were stiff.   Last week, Henry E.

The cities contend in the suit, filed Thursday, that the CensusBureau was prepared to make adjustments to compensate forundercounting, particularly of minority groups, but that it wasoverruled last year by the Commerce Department, its parent body.   Congressional seats and federal grants are allocated on the basisof population. If an area is undercounted, it may have fewerrepresentatives in the House and lose millions of dollars fromWashington.   The Commerce Department referred all calls to the JusticeDepartment. Amy Brown, a spokeswoman, said the department had notyet received the complaint and therefore could not comment.</TEXT><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Struck down by bad luck and last year's stockmarket crash, a once-rising star among entrepreneurs is tryingdesperately to save his business with a 12-day-old hunger strike inan illegally parked van opposite the New York Stock Exchange.   ``I've come to the seat of capitalism, the New York StockExchange, to be heard,'' Jan Stuart said Thursday.
