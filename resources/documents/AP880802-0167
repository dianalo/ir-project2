Studies show that sanctions are working but ``could biteharder,'' said Commonwealth Secretary-General Shridath Ramphal.   He told the ministers from eight Commonwealth nations reviewingthe fight against apartheid that South Africa has reason to feelsecure.   ``The sharply increased censorship and repression of the pastsix months has drawn only verbal responses. The apartheid regimelong ago learned to ignore these ritual condemnations, and it isgrowing increasingly confident that its major trading partners inthe West are not prepared to widen, tighten and intensifysanctions,'' Ramphal said.   Britain, which opposes sanctions, was conspicuous by its absencefrom the committee of foreign ministers. Canada's Joe Clark ischairman and the other envoys are from Australia, Guyana, India,Nigeria, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.   The committee's task is to counter South African censorship andpropaganda; study security problems facing the black front-linestates; review the economic impact of sanctions; and examine SouthAfrica's continuing financial links around the world.   Canada has organized a ``Rekindle the Light'' festival ofconcerts and public forums to coincide with the two-day meeting,climaxed by the lighting of candles on the shores of Lake Ontarioand in homes Tuesday night.   The South African government fought back Tuesday with afull-page advertisement in The Globe and Mail, the nation's leadingnewspaper, which accused the Commonwealth envoys of slander andhypocrisy.   Signed by South African Ambassador Hendrik de Klerk, the ad saidfive of the eight Commonwealth countries represented in Torontohave press restrictions equal to, or more stringent than, SouthAfrica.   ``We resent, as do South Africans of all colors, being singledout for special condemnation.''   It said more than 100 discriminatory laws have been abolished inSouth Africa in the past decade, and claimed great improvements inblack income, education and housing. ``Sanctions, rejected by themajority of blacks, frustrate this progress.''   But Clark blasted South Africa for its crackdown on free speech,including the refusal to grant a travel visa to Cyril Rhamaposa,head of the South African miners' union, so he could attend theToronto meeting.   ``In presenting a false image to the world, the government ofSouth Africa is also pretending to itself,'' Clark said. ``We willconsider individual new steps ... until the system of apartheid isended.''   Canada made censorship the theme of the meeting and will proposemeasures such as establishing a short-wave radio service fromneighboring countries.   But Ramphal's speech underlined concern by many delegates tokeep the focus on economic sanctions.   ``In the absence of sanctions, apartheid will persist and thecycle of violence will only intensify. Effective sanctions havebeen withheld; apartheid has persisted; the cycle of violence hasintensified.''   Ramphal welcomed new sanctions that have been proposed in theU.S. Congress and threatened by the European Community. ``SouthAfrica is immune to anti-apartheid gestures. It is only action thatwill bring the whole sordid system down,'' he said.   In South Africa, the Department of Foreign Affairs called theCommonwealth's actions in Canada a ``blatant interference in thedomestic affairs of South Africa.''   J.W. Meiring, deputy minister of foreign affairs, called inCanadian Ambassador R.S. Maclean to express South Africa'sobjections to the scheduled events.   The department statement said, ``The South African governmentobjected to the biased selectivity of the Canadian government. .. .By these actions the Canadian government does not contribute in anyway constructively toward achieving a peaceful solution to theproblems of southern Africa.''</TEXT></DOC>
