Even the two women he picked _ Carla Hills as the U.S. tradenegotiator and Elizabeth H. Dole as labor secretary _ are long-timefixtures on the capital's power circuit.   In fact, only three people in the new Cabinet had not heldearlier full-time jobs either in Congress or the administration.They are Dr. Louis Sullivan, the head of health and human services;Robert A. Mosbacher at commerce, and Samuel K. Skinner attransportation.   ``I never pledged that I would have a totally inexperiencedCabinet,'' Bush said. ``I want an experienced Cabinet. That'sexactly what we've got.''   Three men are hold-over appointments from the Reaganadministration: Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, Nicholas F. Bradyas treasury secretary and Lauro F. Cavazos as education secretary.   By law and custom, the Cabinet has 14 fixed members. Also sittingin Bush's Cabinet will be Mrs. Hills and Richard Darman, director ofthe Office of Management and Budget. Congress stipulated that thenew drug czar, William Bennett, has Cabinet-level status.   Here are sketches of the incoming Cabinet members:</TEXT><NOTE>STATE</NOTE><TEXT>   Admirers call James Addison Baker III, the new secretary ofstate, the ``ultimate pragmatist.'' At least one skeptic has calledhim ``Mr. Shmooze.''   The accolade suggests an open and adaptable approach; thecriticism, a tendency toward private self-promotion.   At the outset, Baker's strength lies in strong ties to Bush. Hisviews will be heard. He can operate free of anxiety that White Houseofficials are scheming to undercut him.   His main weakness is lack of experience in foreign affairs.   Baker, 58, managed Bush's unsuccessful 1980 presidential driveand his victorious campaign last year.   Baker and Bush have been close for nearly two decades. They sharea wealthy country-club Texas background. Both are Ivy Leaguegraduates _ Bush went to Yale and Baker to Princeton.   At State, the main issues confronting Baker are whether to keepU.S.-Soviet relations on a conciliatory course and what to do aboutthe 40-year Arab-Israeli dispute and the problems in Central America.   His background as treasury secretary will help him cope withrising debt problems in Latin America. His political skills arebound to maintain the smooth relations with Congress and the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization allies that George P. Shultz, hispredecessor, cultivated.   Whatever comes up, Baker should have no trouble getting anappointment with the president or at least reaching him by telephone.   _By Barry Schweid</TEXT><NOTE>TREASURY</NOTE><TEXT>   Nicholas Brady, who as the treasury secretary will be the Bushadministration's chief economic spokesman, has a family pedigree andIvy League education similar to that of his long-time friend, GeorgeBush.   Brady took over the Treasury job last September after James Bakerresigned to run Bush's presidential campaign.   He has kept a low profile so far, in part because there have beenno economic crises which demanded immediate attention. Once Bushtakes office, Brady is expected to play a key role in some of thebiggest problems facing the new administration: how to trim thebudget deficit, how to resolve the savings and loan crisis and whatto do about the $1.3 trillion in debt being carried by Third Worldcountries.   Brady, 58, entered Yale one year after Bush graduated. Afterearning a masters degree in business at Harvard, Brady joined theNew York investment banking firm of Dillon, Read andamp; Co. in 1954,where he spent his entire career.   Brady served briefly as a U.S. senator from New Jersey in 1982,appointed to the seat after the Abscam conviction of DemocratHarrison Williams Jr.   He did not seek election to the post but remained activepolitically as a trouble-shooter for the Reagan administration,serving on four different advisory commissions on the MX missile,Central America, foreign aid and the October 1987 stock market crash.   _By Martin Crutsinger</TEXT><NOTE>HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT</NOTE><TEXT>   Retired pro-football quarterback Jack F. Kemp, a self-described``bleeding heart conservative'' with an interest in housing andhomeless, has vowed to be a team player when he takes over assecretary of Housing and Urban Development.   During nine terms as a congressman from Buffalo, N.Y., Kempgained a reputation for his outspoken views on economic policy andhis staunch anti-communism.   But many people have high expectations that Kemp will put thespotlight back on the housing agency, which has been virtuallyhidden from public view for eight years under Samuel Pierce.   One program that Kemp hopes will breathe economic life into thenation's inner cities is urban enterprise zones, which would givetax incentives to businesses that operate in and employ residentsfrom distressed areas.   Kemp, 53, graduated from Occidental College in 1957 with a degreein physical education. He was drafted by the Detroit Lions but leftthe team to join the Los Angeles Chargers in 1960. He was latertraded to the Buffalo Bills, winning the American Football League'smost valuable player award in 1965.   Kemp was elected in 1970 to his congressional seat in a suburban,blue-collar area. He left the seat to make an unsuccessful bid forthe GOP presidential nomination.   _By Denise Cabrera</TEXT><NOTE>INTERIOR</NOTE><TEXT>   After two decades in Congress, Manuel Lujan Jr. yearned to returnto New Mexico but Bush persuaded him to stay on as the new secretaryof the interior.   Lujan, 60, was described by Bush as a man who wants to find ``acareful balance'' between protecting the environment and developingthe nation's resources.   Lujan, one of two Hispanics in the Bush Cabinet, is oftendescribed as a pragmatist willing to listen to a broad range ofviewpoints. Environmentalists maintain, however, his record isdistinctly pro-business.   In Congress, Lujan co-sponsored a bill that would allow oildevelopment on the arctic coastal plain and voted to cut federalsubsidies for water projects, limit the liability of utilities innuclear accidents, and delay implemention of rules protectingendangered sea turtles.   Lujan was born to a prominent New Mexico family. His father wasmayor of Santa Fe and ran unsuccessfully for governor and Congress.After working briefly in the family's insurance business, Lujan waselected to Congress in l968.   He won re-election with 71 percent of the vote in 1986, a year inwhich he also had triple bypass heart surgery. He has insisted thathis health is fine and did not affect his decision in early 1988against seeking another House term.   _By H. Josef Hebert</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
