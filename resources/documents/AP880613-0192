GANS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jesse Jackson expressed confidence Monday that hecould rally his supporters behind certain Democratic nomineeMichael Dukakis, even if Dukakis doesn't pick him as a running mate.   But Jackson continued to stress that he is entitled to ``seriousconsideration'' for the No. 2 spot on the ticket.   Even if Dukakis picks someone else, Jackson told reporters here,the Massachusetts governor could expect backing from him ``so longas our agreements are rational, fair and consistent.''   Jackson sought to put the focus on harmony with the Dukakiscamp, citing the weekend agreement that South Africa shuld bebranded a ``terrorist state.''   Jackson had strongly pushed that view, and, at a preliminaryplatform-drafting meeting in Mackinac Island, Mich., the Dukakisforces went along.   The South Africa position ``is a step in the right direction forAmerica because we must regain our credibility and our moralauthority in the third world as leader of the free world,'' Jacksonsaid at an impromptu sidewalk news conference here.   Dukakis has backed strong sanctions and a divestiture of U.S.industries in South Africa to protest its apartheid policies ofracial segregation. But the Massachusetts governor had resistedbranding South Africa a ``terrorist state'' in the same category ofstates as Libya and Iran.   ``Our agreeing to declare South Africa a terrorist state andthereby pointing to apply anti-terrorist legislation to SouthAfrica is a real hope to people throughout the world who seekfairness and justice,'' said Jackson.   He said there was ``a good tone'' to the negotiations with theDukakis camp.   ``So far they (the talks) are having an impact on broadening andstrengthening the Democratic Party,'' he said.   But Jackson noted that major differences remain, includingDukakis' refusal to support the freeze on military spending thatJackson has called for, and the Dukakis forces' resistance to thetax hikes Jackson wants.   Jackson was in Chicago for a weekend of meetings with members ofhis national staff to discuss plans for the Democratic NationalConvention in Atlanta next month.   Jackson said he planned to deliver several major policy speechesbefore the convention outlining his programs for health care,education, the war on drugs, and foreign and defense policy.   He also met Monday with the editorial board of the ChicagoTribune and with officials of Johnson Publishing Co., publishers ofJet and Ebony magazines.</TEXT></DOC>
