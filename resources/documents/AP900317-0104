The French music world eagerly awaited the show as an ambitiousand demanding test of the state-of-the-art building. The massiveglass-and-steel structure, shaped like an ocean liner, overlooksthe capital's Place de la Bastille.   Stages, curtains, podiums and other gadgetry are run by 225control drives and three computers. Using the computers, stagehands are able to change scenery by remote control, and lightingcan be programmed into the computer during rehearsals.   South Korean-born Myung-Whun Chung, 37, is conducting the operahouse's first production. The cast features four Americans: ShirleyVerrett, Grace Bumbry, Gary Bachlund and George Gray.   The set design and costumes are the work of Italian veteranPier-Luigi Pizzi, who has erected a giant Trojan horse outside theopera house.   The building, designed by Canada's Carlos Ott, was inauguratedin July with a gala concert. At that time, it drew mixed reviewsfor what some critics called its ``metallic'' acoustics.   Some people close to the production say the first season shouldhave been postponed another year so technicians could master thesophisticated equipment.   In an article before opening night, the Le Monde daily calledthe Opera-Bastille ``a promising prototype delivered beforetrials.'' It said it would become the ``technical marvel it wassupposed to be in 10 years.''   Chung, in comments before opening night, called ``The Trojans''an extremely difficult work.   ``The only hope that I expressed to the musicians is that I hopewe can be successful enough to be able to go on,'' he told Le Monde.   Chung was named artistic and musical director last spring afterDaniel Barenboim was fired in a policy dispute.   According to President Francois Mitterrand, who launched theproject, the new house was made ``modern and popular'' so operawould be more accessible to the masses. Opening night tickets costbetween $6.50 and $60 _ half the price at the old Palais Garnier,now used only for ballet.   Unlike the ornate and obsolete Garnier, which had 400 seats withobstructed views, the 2,700 seats in the Opera-Bastille's mainauditorium have clear views of the stage.   The auditorium _ a sleek design in black, white and oak paneledwalls _ contains two steep balconies. It has seats with holes tolet the sound pass through and an orchestra pit that can be loweredout of sight and covered.   ``The Trojans'' has never been performed in Paris in itsentirety.   Critics said reviving the work of Berlioz, a 19th century Frenchcomposer, was a good idea because he has been received betteraboard than in his homeland.   A full-length version of ``The Trojans'' was performed for thefirst time in French at London's Covent Garden in 1969 under thedirection of British maestro Colin Davis.   ``Colin Davis told me that it almost killed him,'' Chung said.``I thanked him for passing me the torch.''</TEXT></DOC>
