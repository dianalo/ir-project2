It is assumed that the reaction is generated by concerted acid-basecatalysis between residues Glu-58 and His-92 or His-40. From the resultsof chemical modification and NMR studies, it appeared that the residueGlu-58 was indispensable for nucleolytic activity. However, the authorshave recently demonstrated that Glu-58 is an important but not an essentialresidue for catalytic activity, using the methods of genetic engineeringto change Glu-58 to Gln-58 etc. In the present paper, the authors reportthat mutants of RNase T{sub 1} with residue Ala-40 or Ala-92 have almostno activity, while mutants that contain Ala-58 retain considerable activity.These results show that the two histidine residues, His-40 and His-92,but not Glu-58, are indispensable for the catalytic activity of the enzyme.They propose a revised reaction mechanism in which two histidine residuesplay a major role, as they do in the case of RNase A.</TEXT></DOC>
