Petry, president and chief executive officer said.    Earlier this month, the company took a further charge for asbestos-claim costs of $554 million, wiping out its net worth. However, only a relatively small part of the company's reserve currently is funded, meaning that most of the costs will have to be paid from future cash flow.    &quot;The strategy will succeed,&quot; Mr. Petry said. &quot;We are solvent&quot; in spite of a negative net worth, he said, and the big charge will shield the company from income taxes for a number of years.    On a pretax basis, Eagle-Picher has been generating $95 million to $100 million a year of cash flow, Mr. Petry said. &quot;That will dip a little in 1989 because we are selling three divisions,&quot; he said, but by 1991 cash flow is expected to be back at current levels.    With that cash flow, Mr. Petry said in an interview, the company can meet its asbestos-claim costs and still invest up to $35 million a year in plant and equipment. He said that is about $10 million more than depreciation and is more than twice the $12 million to $15 million of capital spending required just to maintain existing buildings and equipment. &quot;We will have $20 million a year of growth-related capital spending,&quot; he said. Capital spending in fiscal 1987 was $38.4 million.    Mr. Petry termed reasonable analysts' estimates that the company will earn $4 a share from operations for the year ending Nov. 30. Because it will pay no taxes after the loss arising from the asbestos charge, operating profit will be close to $6 a share, he indicated. Sales will be about $760 million, he said.    In fiscal 1987, the industrial products company earned $40 million, or $3.70 a share, on sales of $677.2 million. Asbestos-claim costs last year were charged to a $400 million reserve established in 1985, which at the time was expected to cover the company's entire asbestos exposure. </TEXT></DOC>
