(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An investigation into a small plane crashthat killed the state's leading Republican gubernatorial candidateand his pilot has found no malfunctioning instruments, federalofficials said.   Secretary of State Jim Waltermire, 39, and pilot James Morris,64, died Friday night when their Cessna 310 twin-engine planecrashed while attempting to land on instruments in a snow squall.   Waltermire was returning home to Helena from a candidates' forumin Glasgow.   The cause of the crash has not been determined.   ``So far there's really nothing,'' Nick Wantiez of the FederalAviation Administration said Sunday. ``It's probably going to beseveral days.''   Verlin Tranter, an investigator with the National TransportationSafety Board, said initial checks uncovered no malfunctioninginstruments, either on the ground or aboard the plane.   Morris was an experienced pilot, with more than 17,000 hours offlight experience, and was a highly regarded commercial andinstrument flight instructor, officials said.   Waltermire was an often controversial figure who in eight yearsparlayed the backwater post of secretary of state into a highlyvisible state office and a launching platform for the governor'schair.   Two of his principal rivals for the Republican nominationpraised him.   ``He was a worthy contender for governor,'' said former stateSen. Stan Stephens of Havre. Rep. Cal Winslow of Billings calledhis death ``a great loss to Montana.'' Both had debated Waltermirein Glasgow before his fatal flight.   Gov. Ted Schwinden recalled the 1962 plane crash death of Gov.Donald Nutter. Waltermire's accident should serve as a reminder toall candidates ``to put their safety and the requirements of theirpersonal family ahead of political commitments,'' he said.   ``Montana's a tough state to fly,'' he said.``We've all had toomany accidents. We've lost a governor and now we've lost agubernatorial candidate and a secretary of state, which I thinkought to emphasize the risks associated with pushing your luck inMontana politics.''   Chuck Brooke, Waltermire's campaign manager, said a wake wouldbe held for Waltermire Tuesday night at the Cathedral of St. Helena.</TEXT></DOC>
