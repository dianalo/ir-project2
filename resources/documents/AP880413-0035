The latest move away from chlorofluorocarbon, or CFC, compoundscomes from the 15 or so companies who use them to make plastic foamfood packages, things like egg cartons.   They'll be using substitute compounds by the end of the year,their trade association, the Foodservice andamp; Packaging Institute,announced Tuesday. That will make it the first industry to give upCFCs completely.   Consumers should notice little change, since foam packages willstill be on the shelves.   The announcement came after consultations with three majorenvironmental groups, the Natural Resources Defense Council, theEnvironmental Defense Fund and Friends of the Earth. Friends of theEarth already had persuaded some fast-food chains to stop usingCFC-made foam clamshell hamburger warmers, and some cities havebanned these products.   All three praised the industry and were joined by theEnvironmental Protection Agency. EPA chief Lee M. Thomas said in astatement the action was ``A welcome contribution to the protectionof the earth's ozone layer.''   CFC's break down the ozone layer, which protects the Earth fromthe Sun's ultra-violet rays.   The institute's announcement was the third in Washington sinceDecember on ending commercial use of CFC compounds.   In December, the ATandamp;T Corp. said it was switching its solventsfor cleaning computer chips from one of the CFCs.   Last month, the Du Pont Co., the largest producer of CFCs, saidit would work toward a total phaseout of CFC manufacture, but setno deadline.   The institute's program, said Joseph Goffman, attorney for theEnvironmental Defense Fund, ``surpasses in three important respectsthe phaseout program announced by Du Pont.'' It has a deadline,provides for public reporting by the institute on CFC use andestablishes a cooperative program with the environmental groups toencourage the search for an entirely benign substitute, he said.   About a third of current foam packaging for food is made withCFCs, and most of that is expected to be switched to a relatedcompound called HCFC-22, approved last December by the Food andDrug Administration. The institute committed itself to switch to abenign compound, if it can be developed, within a year of approvalby the FDA.   HCFC-22 still has some potential to destroy the high-altitudeozone layer, but EPA estimates it is only about 5 percent aspowerful as the compounds being given up.   The compounds used as blowing agents in making food packagingfoams account for 1.5 percent to 2 percent of the United States'total CFC use, and Geoffrey Webb of Friends of the Earth conceded,``Clearly this is not the bulk of ozone depletion.'''   But Webb said, ``it's clearly an unnecessary use,'' and thesymbolism of the switch is important to the environmentalists.   David Doniger, attorney for the Natural Resources DefenseCouncil, said, ``It is our intention to go to other sectors (of theeconomy) and say, `These guys did it; so can you.'''   The CFCs used in blowing agents are gasses that escape to theatmosphere and rise over a decade to the ozone layer 15 miles to 25miles high.   EPA figures each percent decline in the ozone layer means anincrease in of 4.8 percent to 7.5 percent in the most common skincancer. For this and other reasons, major nations agreed last yearto cut CFC production by 50 percent by 1998.</TEXT></DOC>
