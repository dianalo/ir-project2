But a growing number of job seekers are finding theymust do some work to land a job.   With large pools of talented -- and often desperate --applicants to consider, employers have the upper hand whenfilling slots. Some are prodding candidates to offer expertconsulting advice -- free -- or provide other help in aneffort to win a job.</LP><TEXT>   Consider what Noel White went through last year inapplying for a management-level sales position at a majorpublishing concern -- a job she didn't get. Ms. White, now amarketing executive with Reader's Digest Association, saysshe had seven interviews for the position. She was asked todraw up three marketing plans and prepare a 15-minute oralpresentation analyzing how the company was positioning itselfcompetitively.   What's more, the 14-year publishing-industry veteran, intrying to impress her prospective employer, mentioned some ofher most valuable contacts and offered them as businessleads.   No one apparently got that job; Ms. White subsequentlyheard the position was withdrawn from the market. &quot;I shouldhave charged them for the time I spent trying to get thisjob,&quot; she says, figuring it would have cost the company$10,000 to $15,000 in consulting fees. &quot;It was a way for themto get ideas and marketing plans for nothing.&quot;   Executive Strategies newsletter recently advised companiesthat need a new marketing plan, sales campaign or productpresentation (but don't have the budget to pay for it) togain creative ideas from job applicants -- and even toadvertise a fictitious job opening if necessary to gain suchinsights.   &quot;Since these days, any ad promising a good job pulls likecrazy, you can often get a dozen top-drawer applicants,&quot;noted the National Institute of Business Managementpublication. &quot;You can then sift through the material&quot; and&quot;pick the plumpest raisin out of each cake.&quot; The result, thenewsletter added, &quot;can be a cornucopia of good ideas tailoredto your specific needs.&quot;   The publication itself raised the question of whether suchan approach might be considered unethical and answered in thenegative. &quot;Applicants benefit two ways,&quot; it said. &quot;They gettheir names high up in a potential job bank, and they sharpenskills they'll use anyway -- in their search and at the nextjob they take.&quot;   Job hunters and recruiters alike know firsthand that somecompanies are following the newsletter's advice. And whateverExecutive Strategies may say, most consider such conductreprehensible. Still, they realize that for every applicantwho refuses to play by such rules, there are others who will.   &quot;It's very competitive out there, so people are willing tojump through hoops and go the extra mile for a job,&quot; saysChristopher Polson, who runs Polson andamp; Co., a Minneapolisexecutive-search firm. He cites one executive who, whenapplying for a position as vice president of corporatedevelopment at an Ohio industrial concern, was asked tofurnish the company with a customized turnaround plan.   &quot;Here's a guy with 25 years of experience under his beltwho had already distinguished himself in that same type ofposition for Fortune 500 companies and had consulted for someblue-chip companies on similar issues,&quot; Mr. Polson says. Thatshould have sufficed, he adds. But the executive complied; hedidn't land the job; and the company got some expert advice-- free of charge.   &quot;Companies are taking advantage of people -- they call youin, pick your brains and then forget about you,&quot; contends aformer New York banking executive who has been pounding thepavement for a year. &quot;I'm so mentally drained from it,&quot; shesays, &quot;but I keep telling myself, there has to be somethingout there.&quot;   What has she found so far?   -- A Washington, D.C.-based bank-consulting firm thatasked her to put her 10-plus years of experience inrisk-management and credit analysis to good use by supplyingit with a financial overview of 10 companies it had targeted.   -- A foreign brokerage firm that grilled her for 2 1/2hours about her knowledge of several companies. (Prior to themeeting, she was led to believe the session would be afollow-up interview to discuss the particulars of her beinghired, including salary negotiations.)   -- A big Japanese bank that asked her to design a jobdescription for the overseas position for which she wasapplying, only to turn around and use her write-up toadvertise the job.   &quot;It's sad how people treat people,&quot; she says.   Jonathan Robinson didn't fare much better in hisemployment search. The San Francisco-based independent filmmaker, needing a full-time job to help pay the rent, answereda newspaper ad last fall for an editorial position at a BayArea magazine. He made the first applicant-screening cut andwas then required in four days to critique three manuscriptsand edit two others. The manuscripts ranged in length from 20to 40 pages, covered very dense topics and were very poorlywritten, he says, but he met the deadline. For that, hereceived a standard rejection letter several weeks later. Theeditor &quot;didn't return any of my telephone calls,&quot; he says.&quot;After all that work, I expected at least to get aninterview.&quot;   So how can job seekers tell whether prospective employersare trying to play them for the fool? And what can be done toavoid it?   Here is some advice:   -- Take notice if prospective employers ask questionslike, &quot;Tell me, what would you do in your first month on thejob?&quot; cautions Arnold Menn, an Austin, Texas, outplacementconsultant, who suggests replying: &quot;Hire me, and I'll tellyou.&quot;   -- Be on guard if work is required as part of theapplication process, says Mr. Polson, the executiverecruiter. Sometimes it can't be avoided, he says; but beforedoing any work, find out, if possible, through tactfulquestioning who else is seriously being considered for theposition and whether they are being asked to &quot;jump over thesesame kinds of hurdles.&quot;   -- Watch out for companies that string people along withfollow-up interviews for an indefinite period of time. &quot;Thereare so many more people than jobs that those applicants whoare being seen aren't shooins,&quot; notes New York legalheadhunter Laura Colangelo. She says some law firms thatbring candidates back numerous times may be more interestedin plying them for dirt on their competitors than inevaluating the candidates themselves.   Whatever the merits of such advice, there are those whomaintain that it isn't practical. James E. Challenger, aChicago outplacement executive, argues that in most casesit's worth the gamble for a job applicant to do whatever isasked. He even suggests job seekers volunteer to work forprospective employers for a month without pay to demonstratewhat they can do.   &quot;Anything you can do to distinguish yourself from thecompetition will give you a leg up on someone else,&quot; he says.Mr. Challenger says this approach works for about 70% of hisclients, who manage to turn their assignments into full-timepositions.   Pending such a successful outcome, an international traderfor a British merchant bank has this message for job seekers:&quot;Unless you've got a bid on the table, you've got no offer.&quot;He ought to know. This trader had 12 separate interviews fora position with a major New York brokerage firm before beingtold someone else had landed the job. &quot;Three interviews aresufficient,&quot; says Ms. White, the Reader's Digest marketingexecutive. &quot;Beyond that, your antennae should go up.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
