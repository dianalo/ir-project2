A related question is: How much should the risks people facedepend on where they live?   The agency is asking the questions for benzene, one of thenation's most important chemicals, with nearly 12 billion poundssold annually for making gasoline, rubber, plastics, fibers andmany other chemicals.   Benzene causes slightly more than an estimated three cases ofleukemia a year among people living near chemical plants.Regulatory strategies being subjected to public comment wouldreduce that to one case every other year, one case every 550 yearsor something in between.   Far more than three leukemias, a form of blood cancer, are atissue. The answers will be used to regulate dozens of otherhazardous air pollutants EPA estimates could cause 2,000 cancers ayear.   Roughly half the population breathes industrial-source benzene,almost all in tiny amounts. Those actually at risk are the verysmall numbers of people living close to sources such as coke ovens,refineries and other plants.   Some 240,000 workers are covered by the Occupational Safety andHealth Administration, which permits much higher risks.   EPA is under court order to revise its benzene regulations byDecember. The order requires an initial determination of what is an``acceptable'' risk, ignoring cost and feasibility, then adetermination of what the statutorily required ``adequate margin ofsafety'' should be, taking into account cost and feasibility.   The strictest of the agency's four possible approaches couldmean 131 plants could close, throwing 30,000 to 40,000 people outof work. Similarly, 44 coke byproduct plants might close, with theloss of 7,000 jobs.   Meeting with reporters Wednesday, EPA Administrator Lee M.Thomas said: ``When you make that first decision _ acceptable risk_ depending on how you make it, you may have dramatic consequencesin plant closings and job loss. ... It's very difficult not to takethem into account.''   ``I don't accept'' the inevitability of plant closings, Thomassaid, because the agency has not considered _ and wants comment on_ the extent to which it can get companies to develop newtechnologies in response to tougher new standards.   Existing or planned regulations would control 90 percent to 95percent of emissions in question, and ``It's that (remaining) 5percent that is really where the debate is,'' he said.   Thomas said he decided that before deciding on a risk-reducingapproach, ``the issues should be laid out much more thoroughly, andwe needed a public process,'' including a Washington public hearingSept. 1.   Risks permitted by government vary widely. EPA generally hastried to reduce lifetime risks of cancer when they are one in10,000 or larger, and has tended to ignore risks of one in amillion or less.   Maximum permitted workplace exposure to benzene means a one in100 chance of leukemia, according to OSHA.   The average risk of dying in an auto accident is about one in100. The risk of cancer at sea level from natural backgroundradiation is about one in 1,000. A woman's risk of breast cancer isabout one in 10.</TEXT></DOC>
