Nevertheless, lawyers for Drexel have met with regulators in all50 states to try to smooth a wave of expected punitive actionagainst the brokerage house at the center of Wall Street's ongoingcriminal scandals, the regulators said.   State securities laws bar convicted or admitted felons fromoperating in the securities industry. Drexel has agreed to pleadguilty to six crimes to resolve a range of fraud charges brought bythe Manhattan U.S. attorney's office.   But legal challenges in New York to the federal judge who mustapprove the criminal pact and the separate settlement with theSecurities and Exchange Commission are delaying resolutionindefinitely.   Until Drexel formally enters a plea, states are powerless to tryto punish Drexel.   ``The states can't do anything until there is an order issued onsome sort,'' Susan Bryant, Oklahoma's securities administrator, whoheads a panel of state regulators examining Drexel, said Thursday.   But, she added, ``It probably will mean states will startnegotiating a settlement with Drexel even though there is no orderyet.''   The state officials met privately to discuss Drexel during aconference of the North American Securities AdministratorsAssociation in Washington this week.   Officials said they are studying punitive measures againstDrexel, including fines, suspensions and broad supervision, andconcessions that would permit the firm to retain brokers and dobusiness, such as municipal bonds, with towns and cities.   States don't have to prove any individual investors bought stockin companies tied to the frauds alleged by the government in itssettlements with the firm, but there is broad belief that citizensin all states were affected.   In addition to the legal challenge to the impartiality of U.S.District Judge Milton Pollack, regulators predict that indictedDrexel bond salesman Michael Milken will try to block release ofinternal company documents that state officials may seek to obtain.   While Drexel has agreed to cooperate with the states, if Milkensucceeds in freezing documents, state action could be furtherdelayed, said G.W. McDonald, assistant enforcement commissioner inCalifornia's Department of Corrections.   Regulators said they plan to let class-action suits cover claimsby investors who say they were defrauded by Drexel's actions. About12 such suits have been filed around the nation to date, in statesincluding California, New York and Pennsylvania.   Delaware, where Drexel remains a registered broker but has nooffices, could strip the firm's license to do business and levyfines _ $10,000 per violation. The amount is dwarfed by the $650million the firm has agreed to pay the federal government.   ``If they're out of the retail business in Delaware it may notbe significant,'' said Richard Hubbard, Delaware's top securitiesofficial. ``But if New York or California revokes their license,that would be a big problem.''   But Drexel has moved to avoid losing its license by sellingabout half of its 43-office retail brokerage network _ which dealsdirectly with individual investors _ to Smith Barney, Harris UphamCo. The rest of the department is still on the auction block.   Some state regulators said they would follow the SEC's lead;since the commission did not strip Drexel's license, they feel thestates shouldn't take superceding action.   California, home to Drexel's high-yield junk bond division thatdoes hundreds of millions of dollars in business, has aninsider-trading statute similar to the SEC's and could bar certainDrexel employees and restrain its business if it can trace parts ofthe alleged frauds back to the state.   But some regulators said they would consider the broad nature ofthe SEC pact, which places Drexel under unprecedented supervisionfor three years, when they take action.   In addition, banishing Drexel from California, for example,would take a huge chunk out of the state's securities industry.   ``To the extent that they cleaned up their overall act, we haveto take that into account,'' California's McDonald said.   Added John Baldwin, securities director for Utah: ``They paidtheir pound of flesh, there are class action suits out there. Whyshould I stab the dead?''</TEXT></DOC>
