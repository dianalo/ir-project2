The Hunts, after a lengthy search, have chosen Stephen D. Susman, a 45-year-old Houston trial lawyer with highly polished credentials. His trademark suspenders and cigar are symbols of his tough but pragmatic style, cut from his work as an antitrust lawyer representing plaintiffs.    Texas lawyers say he is one of the state's better known litigators, whose less flamboyant courtroom tactics are a sharp contrast to the two Boston lawyers, Edwin A. McCabe and Stephen F. Gordon, who had represented the Hunts since the suit was filed in June. Messrs. McCabe and Gordon resigned yesterday.    A spokesman for the Hunts said, &quot;We have mutually agreed that it would be beneficial to retain as lead counsel an eminent, Texas-based firm to carry the litigation forward.&quot; He declined to comment further.    Mr. Gordon said, &quot;It was by no means an unpleasant or acrimonious departure.&quot; Asked if he and his partner were told by the Hunts to resign, Mr. Gordon said, &quot;We reached (the decision) mutually.&quot;    So far, the McCabe-Gordon team has lost every major legal argument in the case, which erupted after the Hunts failed to convince the banks to restructure about $1.5 billion in loans to two troubled energy companies, Placid Oil Co., a big independent oil producer, and Penrod Drilling Co., which has the world's largest fleet of offshore drilling rigs.    After one major defeat, the Hunts became mired in embarrassing bankruptcy-court proceedings involving Placid as well as the personal trust of one of the Hunt brothers, William Herbert Hunt. Also, the Hunts have failed in their strategy of trying to oust federal Judge Barefoot Sanders from the case.    &quot;I would hope that battle is over,&quot; Mr. Susman said in an interview yesterday. He said he plans to recommend that the Hunts drop their pleas to remove Judge Sanders, whom they consider liberal and a political opponent of the Hunts.    Like Messrs. McCabe and Gordon, Mr. Susman relishes being a renegade. And although he has represented some Texas banks, the battalion of banks arrayed against him in the Hunt case presents a high-stakes, pin-stripe skirmish from which Mr. Susman wouldn't be likely to back away. &quot;He likes to tilt against the establishment,&quot; said a Dallas lawyer, although Mr. Susman's background hardly sets him apart from the legal bluebloods.    Mr. Susman, a native Texan and a Yale graduate who edited the University of Texas Law Review, later served as a Supreme Court clerk and was a partner in Houston's prestigious Fulbright andamp; Jaworski law firm.    He first came to prominence in 1982 as the lead lawyer in a huge price-fixing case in Houston brought by some 9,000 box buyers against the nation's largest box makers. The manufacturers wound up settling with a $550 million payment, of which Mr. Susman's small firm, Susman, Godfrey andamp; McGowan, pocketed $7.6 million -- most of which went to Mr. Susman.    &quot;He was a child of fortune,&quot; said James Sloan, a Chicago antitrust lawyer who worked with Mr. Susman on the price-fixing case and who said he and Mr. Susman had differences over how to handle the case. He said Mr. Susman became the lead lawyer mostly because he was the only attorney among the 55 law firms representing the plaintiffs who was based in Houston.    &quot;He is a good lawyer,&quot; Mr. Sloan said, &quot;but among the great lawyers in America, Steve Susman hasn't joined the club.&quot;    It isn't clear what impact Mr. Susman would have on the Hunts' legal strategy. His appearance in the case must be approved by Judge Sanders, who has several other motions on his desk involving Messrs. McCabe and Gordon's work.    Although court approval of the replacement is usually routine, Messrs. McCabe and Gordon could be required to stay with the case until some of the loose ends are resolved. </TEXT></DOC>
