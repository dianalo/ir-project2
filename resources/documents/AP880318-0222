Vice President George Bush, enjoying the status of near-nomineeon the Republican side, said Reagan ``did the right thing'' when hedispatched combat troops to Honduras. Rival Bob Dole's campaign wasreduced to skeletal remains with only about a dozen paid aidesremaining.   Meanwhile, the man who directed President Reagan's investigationinto the Iran-Contra affair said he doubted the episode woulddamage Vice President George Bush's bid for the White House. ``Ifully expect the opposition to use it on him,'' said former Sen.John Tower of Texas, but he added the voters ``will tend to focuson the problems of the moment'' and not the past.   The Republican campaign was quiet, appropriately so for a racethat has been all but wrapped up by Bush.   Democrats were running full tilt, with caucuses, primaries andconventions in Kansas, Texas, Puerto Rico and South Dakota thisweekend offering 169 delegates, and the big 138-delegate Michigancaucus showdown a week away.   ``I'm the underdog today, but that doesn't really matter,''Gephardt said as he and 18 House Democratic colleagues movedthrough Michigan. ``I think you will see that the Gephardt messageabout economic revival is going to get through to the Michiganvoters.''   Dukakis, ahead in a new public poll as well as his own,countered with Massachusetts Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, who agreed toappear at labor rallies in two Michigan cities. Looking ahead toother staes, Dukakis also picked up an endorsement from Rep. SamGejdenson of Connecticut. Sources said he would receive one fromRep. Jim Florio of New Jersey on Saturday.   The governor divided his time between Michigan and Kansas duringthe day, and he hit hard against Reagan's decision to airlift 3,200combat troops to Honduras. ``The whole policy in Central America isillegal,'' he said. ``Call back the troops and end this.''   He also criticized the idea of possible presidential pardons forOliver North and others indicted in the Iran-Contra affair onWednesday. But he said, ``I don't want to consider the politicaleffects'' of the indictments.   Bush disagreed strongly with him on Central America.   ``We did the proper thing,'' he said in an interview with aPuerto Rico television station conducted by telephone. ``We are forfreedom and democracy. There is no question that Nicaragua invadedHonduras.''   Gephardt was focusing almost exclusively on Michigan, whichposes a make-or-break test for his faltering candidacy. He andDukakis already have begun airing television commercials in thestate, even though the caucuses are a week away.   Campaigning in regions of the state where factories have closedin recent years, he said, ``It's time we had a president whodefended American jobs rather than foreign protectionism. I rejectthe notion that in order to move some of us ahead, we must leavemillions behind.''   Jesse Jackson won the endorsement of George Sallade, who headedformer candidate Gary Hart's Michigan campaign in 1984 and againthis year. Sallade said he thought most of Hart's supporters wouldfollow suit. ``I expect the racists, if they exist, to beoutnumbered next Saturday,'' he said.   Sen. Albert Gore Jr., of Tennessee campaigned in Puerto Ricolooking for support in Sunday's primary. He said he would considera request from the Popular Democratic Party to exempt thecommonwealth from federal minimum wage laws and said he favorsletting Puerto Ricans decide whether to become a state.   Dole's campaign has been severely curtailed since Tuesday'sIllinois primary defeat at the hands of Bush. Spokeswoman Dale Tatesaid only about 10 to 12 aides were left on the payroll, althoughseveral other officials were volunteering their services. Thecampaign once employed about 300 persons, she said.   Dole has vowed to stay in the race until the Wisconsin primaryon April 5, but Ms. Tate said the Kansas senator was unlikely toair television commercials in Connecticut, which votes on March 29.   The other active challenger to Bush, former televisionevangelist Pat Robertson, campaigned in California, where heproclaimed, ``There has to be a rallying point for conservatives.''   With Bush holding an overwhelming lead in nominating delegatesover his two rivals, most interest focused on the still murkyDemocratic race.   Dukakis and Jackson both spent time in Kansas, which holdscaucuses on Saturday with 39 delegates at stake.   At Washburn University in Topeka, Jackson accused Reagan of``fighting psychological warfare with the Congress, manipulatingthe public mind for more Contra aid.''   Gephardt also looked to translate his victory in last month'sSouth Dakota primary into delegates at a statewide convention onSaturday. And Dukakis and Jackson, the two top finishers in theTexas primary on March 8, looked to carve up most of the 64delegates at the state's caucuses on Saturday.   The other campaign contest of the weekend is Puerto Rico'sprimary, with 51 delegates at stake.   Gephardt's campaign chartered two jets to ferry House members toMichigan to campaign on his behalf. The Missouri congressman ``isobviously a known quantity,'' said Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich. ``Wealso know how he responds in a crisis. We in Congress don't likeweaklings or phonies.''   The other Democrat in the race, Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois, isessentially conceding Michigan to his rivals. He campaigned inPennsylvania during the day, where he criticized Reagan's decisionto send combat troops to Honduras. ``I think, candidly, it wasdesigned not to meet a military threat to Honduras, but to try toline up some votes in the House and the Senate for military aid tothe Contras. And I don't think it's going to work,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
