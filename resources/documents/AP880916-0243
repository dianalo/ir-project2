(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A management group may make a $3.3billion bid to buy Hospital Corp. of America, one of the world'slargest hospital chains, and it is trying to line up financing forthe bid.   But financial analysts were divided over whether HCA was worththe $47-a-share offer the group, which includes the company'schairman, might put on the table.   ``I have no reason to believe that there is a second would-bebuyer out there, but if someone had asked me where it would go, Iwould have said between $50 and $55,'' Margo Durow, an analyst witha J.C. Bradford andamp; Co., said Thursday.   Elaine Hughey Smyth, of Equitable Securities Corp., said theoffer was reasonable and that the time was right for HCA to moveinto private hands.   ``There are no compelling reasons for hospital companies to haveaccess to public markets any more,'' she said. ``They are not in agrowth pattern any more.''   Wall Street also mulled over the propsal. In heavy trading onthe New York Stock Exchange, HCA had soared to $47.50 a shareThursday before closing at $43.75, up $6.62{.   HCA, which owns or operates nearly 400 hospitals worldwide, saidon Thursday that the group of managers, including Chairman ThomasF. Frist Jr., had advised the board of directors about the intendedproposal of $47 a share in cash for HCA's 70.6 million sharesoutstanding.   An HCA statement said Frist planned to negotiate withunidentified third parties to obtain financing for a leveragedbuyout, in which a company is acquired largely with borrowed moneyrepaid from the target company's profits or asset sales.   The Nashville newspaper, the Tennessean, quoted unnamed sourcesas saying the New York investment banking firm Drexel BurnhamLambert Inc. was expected to arrange the financing.   Drexel also handled the sale of high-interest ``junk'' bonds inHCA's $1.64 billion sale of 104 of its hospitals to HealthTrustInc. last year.   HCA said its board had established a special committee to reviewany management proposal for an acquisition and had received noguarantee that one would be   ``We believe in today's environment, HCA, as a private company,could better serve all of its constituents including patients,employees, physicians, and our various communities including andespecially Nashville,'' Frist said.   Frist was the only member of management identified in theattempt.   HCA currently owns 79 medical, surgical hospitals and 51psychiatric hospitals. It also manages 225 other hospitals and ownsor manages 42 international hospitals.   The company reported in July that its profits for the quarterending June 30 increased by 15 percent, partly because of increasedinpatient and outpatient revenues.   For the second quarter, after-tax profit totaled about $70.8million, or $1 a share, on revenue of $1.02 billion. For the sameperiod a year earlier, earnings were $61.3 million, or 74 cents ashare, on revenue of about $1.3 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
