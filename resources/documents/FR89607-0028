Werner, Deputy Director,Environmental Documentation, Biotechnology, Biologics, and EnvironmentalProtection, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, U.S. Departmentof Agriculture, Room 850, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville,MD 20782, (301) 436-8565.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>The khapra beetle (<T3>Trogoderma granarium</T3> Everts) is a plant pest that damages grainand cereal products, seeds, cottonseed meal, nut meats, dried fruits, andother products. The pest can cause serious damage to stored plant products.When infested plant products are left undisturbed in storage for long periodsof time, total loss can be expected. This insect is a threat to billionsof bushels of impotant stored plant products in the United States.The khapra beetle eradication program has the following primary goals:(1) To eradicate infestations of khapra beetle from structures and conveyancesin a prompt, efficacious and environmentally-sound manner; (2) to preventthe spread of the khapra beetle to other uninfested areas in the UnitedStates; and (3) to maintain the khapra beetle-free status of the UnitedStates.The following alternatives were considered in selecting the recommendedcourse of action:(1) No action,(2) Methyl bromide fumigation,(3) Malathion surface treatment, and(4) Integrated control.The environmental assessment anaylyzed the alternatives with respect toprogram efficacy, potential environmental consequences, and cumulativeeffects. Program operational procedures and mitigative measures were alsoconsidered with respect to their ability to minimize environmental consequences.The preferred alternative, integrated control, will employ the componentchemical alternatives, methyl bromide fumigation and/or malathion surfacetreatment, for structures and conveyances.This khapra beetle eradication program will use treatment procedures withinextremely restricted areas, such as warehouses, silos, ships, and containers.Only a few treatments, approximately five to ten, would be required inan average year.After considering the effects of implementing the selected alternative,we have concluded there will be no primary or secondary effects on thehuman environment as a result of the program, and that no adverse effectsare foreseen. We have also considered cumulative impacts, and anticipatethat the program will have a beneficial effect on the environment throughthe coordination and planned reduction of current pesticide use.In the environmental assessment, we evaluated the uniqueness or rarenessof resources being affected and concluded that the selected alternativewill not have an effect on the continued existence of any endangered orthreatened species, or result in the destruction or adverse modificationof the habitats of those species.The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact havebeen prepared in accordance with: (1) The National Environmental PolicyAct of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4331 <T3>et seq.</T3>), (2) Regulations of the Council on Environmental Qualityfor Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (40 CFR Parts 1500-1509),(3) USDA Regulations Implementing NEPA (7 CFR Part 1b), and (4) APHIS GuidelinesImplementing NEPA (44 FR 50381-50384, August 28, 1978, and 44 FR 51272-51274,August 31, 1979).<ITAG tagnum="21">Done in Washington, DC, this 1st day of June 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Larry B.
