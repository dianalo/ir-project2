Ron Dellums, May 1991.                                                                                                       </LP><TEXT>   Only in the U.S. Congress could a war not influencethinking about defense spending. And only such thinking couldexplain why Congress is trying to kill the one weapon thatscares the fatigues off future Saddam Husseins, the B-2Stealth bomber.   Echoing Mr. Dellums, the House voted last month to killB-2 production after 15 planes. President Bush and the AirForce want 75 and have vowed to fight for them in the Senate.This debate is an opportunity to clarify just what sorts ofweapons are needed to defend American interests in thepost-Cold War era. Mr. Bush has the better side on this one.   The Gulf War taught several lessons that are favorable tothe B-2. One is the value of air power. Control of the skiesproved decisive in Iraq, just as it almost certainly will infuture wars. We wish Air Force fly-boys weren't so hostile toachieving this control from space and with unmanned drones,but that doesn't mean there isn't still a role for mannedaircraft, such as the B-2.   Especially if the aircraft are &quot;stealthy&quot; like the B-2.Just as radar changed the nature of warfare in mid-century,so the ability to hide from radar offers enormous strategicadvantages today. The F-117 stealth fighter proved this inspades during the Gulf War, representing only 2.5% of theaircraft but attacking 31% of the targets in the first 24hours. The F-117s flew hundreds of sorties, usually at themost heavily defended targets, without a single loss.   The F-117s' stealthiness meant planners could also putfewer planes and pilots at risk over a target. Conventionalbombers -- say, B-52s -- must fly with an armada of fighterescorts, tankers to refuel and &quot;wild weasel&quot; aircraft thatsuppress enemy defenses. The F-117s can fly without escortsor wild weasels, and because of its great range (6,000 miles)the B-2 can often forego even the tankers. The fewer pilotsplaced at risk, the fewer show up on Baghdad TV as tools ofenemy propaganda.   A third Gulf lesson is about projecting power far fromU.S. shores. An aircraft carrier can take days to steam to acrisis; a posse of B-2s can be there within hours, even froma secure base in the continental U.S. Air Force Lt. Gen.Charles Horner, who planned Desert Storm's air campaign,says, &quot;We may not have 161 days to build up our forces in thenext war.&quot; If Saddam had crossed the line into Saudi Arabiain those precarious days after last August 2, he says, theB-2 would have been the perfect weapon -- maybe the onlyweapon -- to deliver a deterrent blow. &quot;Would I have used aB-2 in Desert Storm? You bet,&quot; adds Gen. Horner.   In the 1986 Libyan raid, too, a pair of B-2s could easilyhave accomplished the same mission as the fleet of F-111sdid, and without creating a diplomatic spat by asking to flyover reluctant &quot;allies&quot; such as France or Spain. Suchgo-it-alone capability is especially valuable in a post-ColdWar world, which will have fewer American bases overseas.   Some critics of the B-2, notably Wisconsin Rep. Les Aspin,claim that stealthy advanced cruise missiles can perform suchmissions more cheaply. But this is the familiar Congressionalpose of always supporting the &quot;next&quot; big weapons system, theone that doesn't require much spending now.   The advanced cruise is indeed valuable, but it also needsplatforms from which to launch; the most secure and flexiblesuch platform is the B-2. Unlike the cruise, the B-2 isre-usable. And unlike either the cruise or a land-basednuclear missile such as Midgetman, the B-2 is recallable. AU.S. President can make a show of force by deploying B-2s,but without starting a war. It gives a President more optionsto sustain the peace by deterring war.   Of course the B-2 is expensive -- wildly so at $814million a copy. The Pentagon's socialist economy producesnothing cheaply. But nearly $31 billion has already beenspent on the B-2's Randamp;D, much of it to perfect &quot;stealth&quot;innovations that are transferable and to make the plane&quot;survivable&quot; (protected against radiation) for nuclearmissions. The cost per copy from here on out is some $420million. As a share of Pentagon spending, the B-2 won't everexceed 2%, less than either the B-52 (3%), B-1 or even theB-36 in their peak years.   In any event, spending isn't really what the B-2 debate isabout; it's about priorities. Messrs. Aspin, Dellums, andcertainly their allies don't want to &quot;save&quot; money; they'llspend every last B-2 dollar on their own &quot;defense&quot;priorities, such as Oshkosh trucks, unwanted reserve units,bases without a purpose and other vote-buying tools. We trustthe Senate would rather buy American security.</TEXT></DOC>
