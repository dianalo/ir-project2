C. Rollins (1940)from material collected in North Carolina in 1939, is an erect, slender,perennial herb with fibrous roots and one (or rarely more) simple or branchedstem growing 0.2 to 0.4 meter tall. Basal leaves are 1 to 2 centimeters(cm) long, 0.5 to 0.6 cm wide, crenate, with one (or rarely two) pair ofsmall lateral lobes. The stem leaves are alternate and mostly unlobed,1 to 1.5 cm long, crenate and cuneate. Flowers and fruits are borne inApril and May. The flowers, subtended by leafy bracts, have four whitepetals, six stamens, and small, round anthers. The fruit is a silique 0.8to 1.2 cm long and approximately 1 millimeter (mm) in diameter with a beak1 to 1.2 mm long. The brown seeds are approximately 1 mm long. <T3>Cardamine micranthera</T3> can be distinguished from its most similarrelative, <T3>Cardamine rotundifolia,</T3> by its much smaller, nearly orbicular(instead of oblong) anthers, smaller flowers, and more angulate leaves.In <T3>Cardamine micranthera,</T3> the anthers are about 0.5 mm long, andthe petals are 1.2 to 2 mm wide; whereas in <T3>Cardamine rotundifolia,</T3> the narrowly oblong anthers measure from1.2 to 1.6 mm long, and the petals are 2.5 to 3.5 mm wide. Growth habitsof the two species differ as well; <T3>Cardamine rotundifolia</T3> has decumbent stems with proliferatingbranches arising both from the main axis and often from the inflorescences.<T3>Cardamine micranthera</T3> has erect or only basally decumbent stemswith no proliferating branches. Also, the siliques and styles of <T3>Cardamine micranthera</T3> are only about half as long as those of<T3>Cardamine rotundifolia</T3> (Rollins 1940, Cooper <T3>et al.</T3> 1977, Radford <T3>el al.</T3> 1964).<T3>Cardamine micranthera</T3> is endemic to seepages, streambanks, andmoist woods along a few small streams in Stokes and Forsyth Counties, NorthCarolina. The single population in Forsyth County was destroyed when thesite was converted to cattle pasture in the early 1960s. Repeated searchesfor the single population known at that time from Stokes County were unsuccessful,and the species was presumed extinct (Cooper <T3>et al.</T3> 1977). In 1985, nearly 30 years after the species had lastbeen seen, it was again located in Stokes County by S. W. Leonard (1986).Subsequent searches by A. Weakley (North Carolina Natural Heritage Program)and N. Murdock (Service) resulted in the discovery of two more populationsin Stokes County. All three remaining populations are located on privatelyowned lands. The continued existence of this species is threatened by conversionof its habitat to pasture, habitat destruction and/or desiccation associatedwith logging, encroachment by aggressive nonnative species such as Japanesehoneysuckle (<T3>Lonicera japonica</T3> Thunberg), impoundment or channelization ofthe small stream corridors it occupies, and flooding and associated scouringof its streambank habitat.The remaining populations are small in numbers of plants and extent ofoccupied habitat. The smallest population consists of only 3 plants; thelargest, consisting of about 200 plants, occupies less than \1/10\ of amile of streambank. With all three remaining sites in private ownership,the species is extremely vulnerable to extirpation resulting from habitatalteration. Federal government actions on this species began with section 12 of theEndangered Species Act of 1973, which directed the Secretary of the SmithsonianInstitution to prepare a report on those plants considered to be endangered,threatened, or extinct. This report, designated as House Document Number94-51, was presented to Congress on January 9, 1975. The Service publisheda notice in the July 1, 1975, <T4>Federal Register</T4> (40 FR 27832) of its acceptance of the reportof the Smithsonian Institution as a petition within the context of section4(c)(2) (now section 4(b)(3)) of the Act and of its intention thereby toreview the status of the plant taxa named within. <T3>Cardamine micranthera </T3>was included in the July 1, 1975, noticeof review. On December 15, 1980, the Service published a revised noticeof review for native plants in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (45 FR 82480). <T3>Cardamine micranthera </T3>was included in that notice as a category1 species. Category 1 species are those species for which the Service currentlyhas on file substantial information on biological vulnerability and threatsto support proposing to list them as endangered or threatened. A revisionof the 1980 notice that maintained <T3>Cardamine micranthera </T3>in this category was published on September27, 1985 (50 FR 39526). Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Endangered Species Act, as amended in 1982, requiresthe Secretary to make certain findings on pending petitions within 12 monthsof their receipt. Section 2(b)(1) of the 1982 amendments further requiresthat all petitions pending on October 13, 1982, be treated as having beennewly submitted on that date. This is the case for <T3>Cardamine micranthera </T3>because of the acceptance of the 1975 Smithsonianreport a petition. In October of 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987, and 1988,the Service found that the petitioned listing of <T3>Cardamine micranthera </T3>was warranted but precluded by other listingactions of a higher priority and that additional data on vulnerabilityand threats were still being gathered. Publication of this proposal constitutesthe final 1-year finding that is required. <ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Factors Affecting the Species </ITAG>Section 4(a)(1) of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 <T3>et seq.</T3>) and regulations (50 CFR Part 424) promulgated to implementthe listing provisions of the Act set forth the procedures for adding speciesto the Federal lists. The species may be determined to be endangered orthreatened due to one or more of the five factors described in section4(a)(1). These factors and their application to <T3>Cardamine micranthera </T3>Rollins (small-anthered bittercress) areas follows: A. <T3>The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailmentof its habitat or range. </T3>Three populations of <T3>Cardamine micranthera </T3>are known to exist in Stokes County, NorthCarolina. One other historically known population has been extirpated dueto conversion of the habitat to cattle pasture. The three remaining populationsare located on privately owned lands and are small and extremely vulnerableto extirpation. Activities that could further threaten the continued existenceof <T3>Cardamine micranthera, </T3>if not undertaken in a manner consistentwith protection of the species, include impoundment, channelization, conversionof the habitat to pasture, logging, encroachment of exotic species suchas <T3>Lonicera japonica, </T3>and flooding (which will be discussed in detailunder Factor E below). B. <T3>Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educationalpurposes. </T3><T3>Cardamine micranthera </T3>is not currently a significant componentof the commercial trade in native plants. However, because of its smalland easily accessible populations, it is vulnerable to taking and vandalismthat could result from increased specific publicity. C. <T3>Disease or predation. </T3>Not applicable to this species at this time.D. <T3>The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms. </T3><T3>Cardamine micranthera </T3>will soon be added as an endangered speciesto the State list of endangered species in North Carolina (R. Sutter, NorthCarolina Plant Protection Program, personal communication, 1988) and thuswill be afforded legal protection in that State by North Carolina GeneralStatutes, andSection;andSection; 106-202.12 to 106-202.19 (Cum. Supp. 1985),which provide for protection from intrastate trade (without a permit),for monitoring and management of State-listed species, and prohibit takingof plants without written permission of landowners. State prohibitionsagainst taking are difficult to enforce and do not cover adverse alterationsof habitat, such as channelization, impoundment, or conversion for agriculturalor silvicultural use. Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution ControlAct could potentially provide some protection for the habitat of <T3>Cardamine micranthera</T3>; however, most, if not all, of the siteswhere it occurs do not meet the wetlands criteria of the Federal WaterPollution Control Act. The Endangered Species Act would provide additionalprotection and encouragement of active management for <T3>Cardamine micranthera</T3>. E. <T3>Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence.</T3>As mentioned in the ``Background'' section of this proposed rule,the three remaining populations of this species are small in numbers ofindividual stems and in area covered by the plants. In some cases, aggressiveexotic species such as <T3>Lonicera japonica </T3>have invaded adjacent areas and threaten toinvade this species' habitat, which could result in the elimination of<T3>Cardamine micranthera. </T3>The natural habitat of this species consistsof small streambank seeps and, secondarily, adjacent sandbars and streamedges. At one of the remaining populations, the original seep habitat canno longer be found, and the surviving plants now exist only in the streambeditself on two small sandbars. In this situation, the species is highlyvulnerable to natural catastrophes such as floods, which could scour thestreambed and eliminate the few remaining plants. In unaltered habitat,where most of the plants occupy the seepages above the actual stream channel,flooding and scouring of the streambed is not as potentially threateningto the species since scoured areas where plants have been eliminated areprobably easily recolonized by the populations in the seeps. The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial informationavailable regarding the past, present, and future threats faced by thisspecies in determining to propose this rule. Based on this evaluation,the preferred action is to list <T3>Cardamine micranthera </T3>as endangered. With only three populationsremaining in existence and one having already been eliminated; and withall the remaining populations being small, highly vulnerable, and locatedon privately owned lands, the species definitely warrants protection underthe Act. Endangered status seems appropriate because of the imminent seriousthreats facing the three remaining populations. Critical habitat is notbeing designated for the reasons discussed below. <ITAG tagnum="84">Critical Habitat </ITAG>Section 4 (a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that, to the maximumextent prudent and determinable, the Secretary designate any habitat ofa species which is considered to be critical habitat at the time the speciesis determined to be endangered or threatened. The Service finds that designationof critical habitat is not prudent for <T3>Cardamine micranthera </T3>at this time. As discussed under FactorB in the ``Summary of Factors Affecting the Species'' section, <T3>Cardamine micranthera </T3>is threatened by taking and vandalism. Suchactivities are difficult to enforce against and only regulated by the Actwith respect to plants in cases of (1) removal and reduction to possessionfrom lands under Federal jurisdiction, or malicious damage or destructionon such lands; and (2) removal, cutting, digging up, or damaging or destroyingin knowing violation of any State law or regulation, including State criminaltrespass law. Publication of critical habitat descriptions would make thespecies even more vulnerable and increase State enforcement problems. Allinvolved parties and landowners will be notified of the location and importanceof protecting and managing this species' habitat. <ITAG tagnum="84">Available Conservation Measures </ITAG>Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatenedunder the Act include recognition, recovery actions, requirements for Federalprotection, and prohibitions against certain practices. Recognition throughlisting encourages and results in conservation actions by Federal, State,and private agencies, groups, and individuals. The Act provides for possibleland acquisition and cooperation with the States and requires that recoveryactions be carried out for all listed species. Such actions are initiatedby the Service following listing. The protection required of Federal agenciesand the prohibitions against taking are discussed, in part, below. Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluatetheir actions with respect to any species that is proposed or listed asendangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat if anyis being designated. Regulations implementing this interagency cooperationprovision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR Part 402. Section 7(a)(4) requiresFederal agencies to confer informally with the Service on any action thatis likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a proposed species orresult in the destruction or adverse modification of proposed criticalhabitat. If a species is subsequently listed, section 7(a)(2) requiresFederal agencies to ensure that activities they authorize, fund, or carryout are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of such a speciesor to destroy or adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal actionmay adversely affect a listed species or its critical habitat, the responsibleFederal agency must enter into formal consultation with the Service. Federal activities that could impact <T3>Cardamine micranthera </T3>and its habitat in the future include, butare not limited to, channelization of streams, construction of impoundments,and issuance of permits for mineral exploration and mining. The Servicewill work with the involved agencies to secure protection and proper managementof <T3>Cardamine micranthera </T3>while accommodating agency activities tothe extent possible. The Act and its implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.61, 17.62,and 17.63 set forth a series of general trade prohibitions and exceptionsthat apply to all endangered plants. With respect to <T3>Cardamine micranthera, </T3>all trade prohibitions of section 9(a)(2)of the Act, implemented by 50 CFR 17.61, would apply. These prohibitions,in part, would make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdictionof the United States to import or export, transport in interstate or foreigncommerce in the course of commercial activity, sell or offer for sale thisspecies in interstate or foreign commerce, or to remove and reduce to possessionthe species from areas under Federal jurisdiction. In addition, for listedplants the 1988 amendments to the Act (Pub. L. 100-478) prohibit (1) theirmalicious damage or destruction on Federal lands, and (2) their removal,cutting, digging, or damaging or destroying in knowing violation of anyState law or regulation, including State criminal trespass law. Certainexceptions can apply to agents of the Service and State conservation agencies.The Act and 50 CFR 17.62 and 17.63 also provide for the issuance of permitsto carry out otherwise prohibited activities involving endangered speciesunder certain circumstances. It is anticipated that few trade permits wouldever be sought or issued, since <T3>Cardamine micranthera </T3>is not common in cultivation or in the wild.Requests for copies of the regulations on plants and inquiries regardingthem may be addressed to the Office of Management Authority, U.S. Fishand Wildlife Service, P.O. Box 27329, Central Station, Washington, DC 20038-7329(202/343-4955). <ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comments Solicited  </ITAG>The Service intends that any final action resulting from this proposalwill be as accurate and as effective as possible. Therefore, any commentsor suggestions from the public, other concerned governmental agencies,the scientific community, industry, or any other interested party concerningany aspect of this proposed rule are hereby solicited. Comments particularlyare sought concerning:  (1) Biological, commercial trade, or other relevant data concerning anythreat (or lack thereof) to <T3>Cardamine micranthera;  </T3>(2) The location of any additional populations of <T3>Cardamine micranthera</T3> and the reasons why any habitat should orshould not be determined to be critical habitat as provided by Section4 of the Act;  (3) Additional information concerning the range and distribution of thisspecies; and,  (4) Current or planned activities in the subject area and their possibleimpacts on <T3>Cardamine micranthera.  </T3>Final promulgation of any regulation on <T3>Cardamine micranthera</T3> will take into consideration the commentsand any additional information received by the Service, and such communicationsmay lead to adoption of a final regulation that differs from this proposal. The Endangered Species Act provides for a public hearing on this proposal,if requested. Requests must be filed withing 45 days of the date of theproposal. Such requests must be made in writing and addressed to the FieldSupervisor, Asheville Field Office (see <T2>ADDRESSES </T2>section).<ITAG tagnum="84">National Environmental Policy Act  </ITAG>The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment,as defined under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Actof 1969, need not be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuantto section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. A noticeoutlining the Service's reasons for this determination was published inthe <T4>Federal Register</T4> on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244).<ITAG tagnum="84">References Cited</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Cooper, J., S.
