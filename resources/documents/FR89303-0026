The exemption appliesto this proposed rule. The General Services Administration (GSA) certifiesthat this document will not have a significant economic effect on a substantialnumber of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.601 et seq.). The number of small entities to which the restrictions inPart 525 would apply is considered not significant in relation to the totalnumber of small entities that do business with the General Services Administration.To the extent that the warranty clauses prescribed in section 546.710 relyon the contractor's standard commercial warranty, the regulatory impacton small entities is also considered insignificant. Therefore, no regulatoryflexibility analysis has been prepared. The Buy American Act_Hand or MeasuringTools or Stainless Steel Flatware clause at 552.255-70 contains an informationcollection requirement which requires the approval of OMB under section3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act. The collection requirement in section552.225-70 has previously been approved by OMB and assigned Control No.3090-0198. Since the collection requirement is being amended to includestainless steel flatware, this proposed rule has been submitted to OMBfor approval. Comments on the information collection requirement in GSAR552.225-70 may be directed to the Office of Information and RegulatoryAffairs of OMB, Attention: Desk Officer for GSA, Washington, DC 20503.The title of the collection is ``General Services Administration AcquisitionRegulation (GSAR), Part 525, Foreign Acquisition.'' The provision at GSAR552.225-70 requires offerors to identify items that are foreign end productsand the amount of import duty applicable to each item. The informationis needed by the contracting office to comply with procurement restrictionsfor hand or measuring tools and stainless steel flatware contained in GSAand DOD Appropriation Acts. The respondents are offerors on GSA acquisitionsfor hand or measuring tools and stainless steel flatware. The estimatedannual burden for this collection is 6.7 hours. This is based on an estimatedaverage burden hour per response of 0.16, a proposed frequency of 1 responseper respondent, and an estimated number of respondents of 40.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 48 CFR Parts 525, 546, 552.</ITAG>Government procurement.1.
