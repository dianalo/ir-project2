<DOC><DOCNO> WSJ880512-0016 </DOCNO><HL> Business Brief: Harley-Davidson Inc. </HL><SO> </SO><CO> HDI </CO><TEXT>   Harley-Davidson Inc. said it adopted an anti-takeover measure involving the distribution of preferred-stock purchase rights on each common share outstanding.    The plan was adopted after the Milwaukee-based company's shareholders approved an amendment creating a class of preferred stock at the annual meeting. Harley-Davidson, which makes motorcycles and recreational vehicles, said it isn't aware of any effort to acquire control of the company.    Under certain circumstances, the rights would allow holders to buy Harley-Davidson or an acquiring company's stock at half price.    Shareholders also voted that stockholder action must be taken only at meetings where stockholders are represented in person or by proxy; that bars action by mere written consent. They also approved staggered terms for directors and a requirement that notice of director nominations by stockholders be given before the annual meeting. </TEXT></DOC>
