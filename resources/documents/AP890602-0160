HANEY</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A new biological technique should simplify theslow and difficult task of shifting genes between creatures andperhaps help scientists create healthier, faster-growing farmanimals, experts said Friday.   ``If it's true, it will make life easier,'' said Dr. RichardHynes of Massachusetts Institute of Technology.   The new method uses nature's own gene carrier _ spermatozoa _ topiggyback foreign genes from one animal to another.   Scientists at many labs have already become adept at shiftinggenes using other techniques, and they have created animals withmany unique properties never envisioned by nature.   Such so-called transgenic animals may have many virtuesengineered into them, such as leaner meat, resistance to diseaseand faster growth. Or they might produce human proteins in theirmilk for use as medicines.   In the new method, sperm were incubated with foreign geneticmaterial, or DNA, in a test tube. Some of the sperm captured theforeign genes. When these sperm fertilized eggs, they passed alongthe hitchhiking genes, which became part of the new animals'permanent genetic code.   ``If sperm will really carry DNA in, it will make it easier thanall the trouble we have to go through now to get genes in,'' saidHynes. ``If it makes something easy that is now difficult, thenlots of people will do it.''   The technique was developed by Dr. Corrado Spadafora of theInstitute of Biomedical Technology at the University of Rome. Areport on the work was published in Friday's issue of the journalCell, based in Cambridge, Mass.   In an accompanying editorial in the journal, Dr. Max Birnstielof the Research Institute of Molecular Pathology in Vienna wrotethat ``if confirmed by others, this publication will be acornerstone in biology.''   Experts said the work also suggests that sperm may be a naturalpoint of entry for foreign genes. This may help explain howgenetically controlled traits could have passed between animalsover the course of evolutionary change.   When used in mice, researchers were able to transfer bacterialgenes that produce an enzyme. Of 250 mice born from treated sperm,30 percent showed the presence of the foreign genes.   The scientists checked for the mice's ability to produce thebacterial enzyme and also found that the new genes appeared to bepassed on to later generations of mice.   Dr. Mario Capecchi of the University of Utah said that when usedin lab mice, the new technique is ``a lot simpler and cheaper'' butprobably no more efficient than the current technique, whichinvolves microscopically injecting foreign genes into one-cellembryos.   ``I don't think it will affect mouse biology, but where it mayhave a big advance is where people are making transgenic domesticanimals, such as cows and sheep,'' Capecchi said.   He said the current methods don't work particularly well inthese large animals, and the new technique may be more effective,although that has not been tested yet.</TEXT></DOC>
