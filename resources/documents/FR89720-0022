The Department received over200 comments in response to the proposal, and conducted a public hearingon the proposed regulation on April 25, 1988. The following discussionsummarizes the proposed regulation and the major issues raised by the commentatorsand explains the Department's reasons for adopting the final regulation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background </ITAG>Section 408(b)(1) of the Act provides a statutory exemption which permitsa plan fiduciary within the meaning of 3(21)(A) of the Act to make loansfrom the plan to plan participants and beneficiaries. In the absence ofan exemption, such transactions would be prohibited under section 406 ofthe Act. Specifically, section 406(a)(1)(B) prohibits a plan fiduciaryfrom engaging in the direct or indirect lending of money to parties ininterest to the plan such as themselves or other fiduciaries, plan participants,or employers whose employees are covered by the plan; section 406(b) alsoprohibits a plan fiduciary from engaging in transactions on behalf of theplan in which he has a conflict of interest. The final regulation 29 CFR2550.408b-1 defines the scope of the exemption and the specific conditionscontained therein. Under section 102 of Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1978 (43 FR 47713, October17, 1978), the Secretary of Labor has the authority to promulgate regulationsfor section 4975(d)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code), a parallelprovision to section 408(b)(1) of ERISA. Therefore, unless otherwise specified,all references herein to section 408(b)(1) of the Act apply also to section4975(d)(1) of the Code.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion</ITAG>A. Scope of the RegulationProposed regulation paragraph 2550.408b-1(a)(1) set out the terms of section408(b)(1) of the Act under which participant loans are permitted. Specifically,the proposed regulation stated that the relief provided under section 408(b)(1)is available if loans made by a plan to participants and beneficiarieswho are parties in interest with respect to the plan (A) are availableto all such participants and beneficiaries on a reasonably equivalent basis;(B) are not made available to highly compensated employees, officers, orshareholders \1\<NOTE/> in an amount greater than the amount made available to otheremployees; (C) are made in accordance with specific provisions regardingsuch loans set forth in the plan; (D) bear a reasonable rate of interest;and (E) are adequately secured. The proposal made it clear that participantloan transactions that meet these criteria will not violate section 406(a)of the Act (which prohibits fiduciaries from engaging in certain transactionswith parties in interest), section 406(b)(1) of the Act (which prohibitsa fiduciary from dealing with plan assets in his own interest or for hisown account) or section 406(b)(2) of the Act (which prohibits fiduciariesin their individual or in any other capacity from acting in any transactioninvolving the plan on behalf of, or representing a party whose interestsare adverse to those of the plan, its participants, or its beneficiaries).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Section 1114(b)(15)(B) of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (Pub.L. 99-514) amended section 408(b)(1)(B) by deleting the phrase ``highlycompensated employees, officers, or shareholders'' and substituting thephrase ``highly compensated employees (within the meaning of section 414(q)of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986).'' Thus, andSection; 2550.408b-1(a)(1)contains a provision reflecting the statutory amendment.Proposed andSection; 2550.408b-1(a) clarified that fiduciaries who are planparticipants are permitted to receive loans under a participant loan program.Because the Department received no unfavorable comments on this paragraph,it has been adopted as proposed.The Department notes, however, that the exemption encompasses certain transactionsin which the potential for self-dealing by fiduciaries exists and in whichthe interests of fiduciaries may conflict with the interests of participants.To guard against potential abuses, the Department will subject loans tofiduciaries to special scrutiny to assure that the conditions of the regulationare met. In this regard, the regulation is designed to assure that participantloan programs are operated under strict objective criteria. Accordingly,the regulation specifically requires that a fiduciary may only receivea loan from a plan if: (1) The program is administered under strict objectivecriteria which assure the equitable availability of the assets committedto the program among qualified participants, and (2) the borrowing fiduciarydoes not receive more favorable consideration or terms than other planparticipants requesting a loan. As did the proposal, the final regulationalso states that section 408(b)(1) of the Act will not exempt transactionsviolating the provisions of section 406(b)(3) of the Act. Such a transactionis a separate transaction not covered by section 408(b)(1).Proposed andSection; 2550.408b-1(a)(3) made clear that a loan will not beexempt under section 408(b)(1) unless it is arranged and approved by thefiduciary administering the loan program primarily in the interest of theparticipants and such loan otherwise satisfies the conditions set forthin section 408(b)(1) of the Act. For example, the section 408(b)(1) exemptiondoes not provide relief for loan programs which grant loans only to employeeswho agree to apply the loan proceeds for the benefit of some other partyin interest, such as the employer. \2\<NOTE/> However, in the absence of any inappropriate preconditionor other facts and circumstances indicating that the loan program is notadministered primarily for the benefit of the participants, the proposalcontained no restrictions on the uses that plan participants may make ofthe loan proceeds. In this regard, one commentator urged that the regulationspecifically prohibit participant loan proceeds being reloaned  to theemployer because of the great potential for coercion of employees withoutsuch a limitation.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Example (8) of andSection; 2550.408b-1(a)(4) of the finalregulation indicates, however, that a loan program will not fall outsidethe scope of the regulation merely because the program, by its expressterms, limits loans to certain stated purposes, <T3>e.g., </T3>hardship, medical or college education, which are not inconsistentwith the interests of plan participants and beneficiaries. Any such limitation,however, must also meet the requirement of andSection; 2550.408b-1(b)(1)that loans under the program be available to participants and beneficiarieson a reasonably equivalent basis.While the Department acknowledges that a potential for employer coercionmay exist under the proposed regulatory scheme, it believes that any benefitwhich might be gained by imposing a strict prohibition against the subsequentuse by or transfer to a party in interest of a participant loan would befar outweighed by the practical problems such a prohibition would createfor the fiduciary administering the loan program, <T3>e.g.,</T3> the monitoring by the administering fiduciary of the actualsubsequent use of the proceeds of each loan by each participant. As explained by Example (3) of andSection; 2550.408b-1(a)(4), a loan programmay meet all the conditions of section 408(b)(1) so that the loans willbe exempt under that section, and yet if the employer exerts pressure onparticipants to borrow funds and reloan the proceeds to him, that coercionwill be viewed by the Department as a separate transaction violative ofCode section 4975(c)(1)(D) that is not exempt under ERISA section 408(b)(1)or Code section 4975(d)(1). As illustrated by that example, the employerwould be liable for the excise taxes under Code section 4975. In this regard,the Department also notes that section 511 of ERISA makes it unlawful fora person to coerce a participant for the purpose of interfering with aright he has under a plan. In contrast, where a participant has taken outa plan loan and by exercising his unfettered discretion has transferredthe proceeds to a party in interest, the final regulation, as did the proposal,contains no restrictions on the use of the loan proceeds.In the event of a default on a participant loan, the preamble to the proposedregulation stated that the relief provided by section 408(b)(1) necessarilyincludes the foreclosure on, or sale or disposal of, a plan's securityinterest by a fiduciary. The Department stressed, however, that the section408(b)(1) exemption does not extend to the sale or disposal of the securityinterest to a party in interest and further cautioned that, in circumstancesother than default, the transfer of property by a party in interest inrepayment of a participant loan will be viewed as a prohibited sale orexchange of property between a plan and a party in interest under section406 of the Act.One commentator queried why a sale of collateral on default to a partyin interest must be prohibited. In response, the Department notes thatCongress strictly delimited the exemptive relief provided by section 408(b)(1)to the otherwise prohibited transaction of a loan of plan assets from aplan to a party in interest who is either a participant or beneficiaryof that plan. There is no evidence in either the statute or legislativehistory of a Congressional intent to exempt any other prohibited transaction_suchas a sale of the plan security upon participant default to a party in interest_whichmay flow from, but is not a necessary result of, the loan transaction.It is the position of the Department that the sale of collateral upon defaultto a party in interest would constitute a separate prohibited transactionnot described in section 408(b)(1).As explained in the proposal, it is the Department's position that theexemption under section 408(b)(1) applies only to <T3>bona fide </T3>loans. If a loan is made with the understanding thatthe borrower has no intention to repay, the transaction would not be considereda participant loan for purposes of the relief provided by section 408(b)(1),but would merely constitute a transfer of plan assets to or for the benefitof a party in interest in violation of section 406(a)(1)(D) of the Actand section 4975(c)(1)(D) of the Code. Whether any particular loan satisfiesthe requirements of section 408(b)(1) will be determined based on all thefacts and circumstances of the transaction. \3\<NOTE/> The Department received no substantive comments in this area,and, accordingly, the Department has retained its position as proposed.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ The Department does wish to note that, in its opinion,the fact of a subsequent default will not, in itself, cause the Departmentto treat the loan as one which was entered into with no intention to repay.Commentators also sought clarification as to the extent of fiduciary liabilityin administering a loan program with respect to both the general statutoryrequirement of diversification and the specific requirement of section408(b)(1) that loans be made available on a reasonably equivalent basis.It was requested that the final regulation specifically limit the liabilityof all plan fiduciaries other than the fiduciary responsible for administeringthe loan program. In this regard, one commentator suggested that the regulationshould be amended to clarify that the administration of a loan programis not a trustee responsibility under section 405(c)(3) of ERISA for thefollowing reasons: (1) Participant loan programs are usually administeredby a loan committee and not by the plan trustee(s), and (2) participantloans are regarded as an incidental plan benefit, and as such should notbe considered as involving management of plan assets.The Department notes that the exemption provided by 408(b)(1) providesrelief from the prohibited transaction rule of section 406 of the Act butnot the fiduciary responsibility rules set out in sections 404 and 405.In this regard, Congress stated that all statutory exemptions from theprohibited transaction rules are:<ITAG tagnum="21">To have no effect with respect to the basic fiduciary responsibilityrules requiring prudent action, diversification of investments, and actionsexclusively for the benefit of participants and beneficiaries, etc. \4\<NOTE/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ H.R.

In this regard, several commentators suggested that theDepartment utilize its authority and grant a blanket exemption in thisregulation from the prohibited transaction rules for owner-employees. TheDepartment has determined that such an exemption is beyond the scope ofthis regulation, which relates solely to the statutory relief providedby section 408(b)(1). \5\<NOTE/> However, consideration will be given to individual requestsfor relief in this area in accordance with established procedures. (SeeERISA Proc. 75-1, 40 FR 18471, April 28, 1975). \6\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ The Department notes that section 408(d), while amendedto permit exemptions under section 408(a), specifically provides that thestatutory relief under 408(b)(1) is not available to owner-employees.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ On June 28, 1988, the Department proposed a new prohibitedtransaction exemption procedure which the Department intends to finalizein the immediate future. (53 FR 24422).B. Reasonably Equivalent Basis Under section 408(b)(1)(A) of the Act, the 408(b)(1) exemption appliesonly if the loans are available on a reasonably equivalent basis to allparticipants and beneficiaries of the plan. Consistent with the legislativehistory of this provision, proposed andSection; 2550.408b-1(b) required thatsuch loans be made available to all plan participants and beneficiarieswithout regard to an individual's race, color, religion, age, sex or nationalorigin, while permitting a plan to consider factors which would be consideredin a normal commercial setting by an entity in the business of making similarloans, <T3>e.g., </T3>the applicant's creditworthiness.\7\<NOTE/> Also consistent with the legislative history, the Departmentindicated that a plan could consider financial need in determining loanavailability.\8\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ Conf. Rpt., <T3>supra </T3>at 311, <T3>reprinted in </T3>Legis. Hist., <T3>supra, </T3>at 4578. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ <T3>Id. </T3>Finally, the proposal stated that both the form and operation of the participantloan program will determine whether, in actual practice, loans are unreasonablywithheld from any applicant. As the proposed examples (1) and (2) at andSection;2550.408b-1(b)(2) illustrated, the proposed regulation would prohibit thepractice of applying different terms to different loan applicants, <T3>e.g., </T3>offering lower interest rates to certain applicants withouta commercial justification or informally restricting    access to loansto certain participants. The proposal also indicated that under particularfacts and circumstances, loan programs which have uniformly applied loanrequirements but which in operation exclude large numbers of plan participantsfrom receiving loans under the program may be found to have failed to makeloans available to all participants on a reasonable equivalent basis. <T3>See, e.g., </T3>andSection; 2550.408b-1(a)(4), Example (8), and andSection;2550.408b-1(b)(2), Example (3). The Department received a number of comments asking whether loan programsthat exclude all but active employees from participation would be consideredto be providing loans on a reasonably equivalent basis. In this regard,it is the position of the Department that such an exclusion is not justifiablebecause the statute provides, without condition, that section 408(b)(1)applies to loans that, <T3>inter alia, </T3>are available to <T3>all </T3>participants and beneficiaries on a reasonably equivalentbasis. It should be noted, however, that these regulations are intendedto be sufficiently flexible to accommodate differing treatment of loanapplicants based on valid economic differences which may exist betweenactive employees and other participants and beneficiaries and which commerciallenders in the business of making similar types of loans legally recognizefor purposes of loan availability. Thus, participants and beneficiariesother than active employees may be offered loans on different terms andconditions where such terms and conditions are based solely on factorsthat are legally considered by commercial entities in the business of makingsimilar loans. Several commentators requested clarification concerning the reference inthe proposed regulation to creditworthiness as the type of commercial factorthat plans could consider in granting loans. These commentators expressedconcern that andSection; 2550.408b-1(b)(1)(ii) might be read as requiringplans to consider each applicant's creditworthiness in order to meet therequirements of the regulation. As a point of clarification, considerationmay be given to individual creditworthiness if the plan is so designed;however, the final regulation does not require that a program be so designed.In this regard, the Department reiterates that the fiduciary administeringthe loan program must do so in such a way as to comport with the generalfiduciary responsibilities of ERISA, <T3>e.g., </T3>the provisions of section 404. Therefore, based on the factsand circumstances of any particular loan program, the administering fiduciarymust decide what factors need to be taken into consideration in order toadminister that particular program prudently. Other commentators questioned whether minimum or maximum loan amounts,or required minimum account balances were permissible under this section.Commentators suggested that minimum loan amounts were necessary becauseof the administrative cost of processing loans, and many asked that theregulation provide a ``safe harbor'' minimum loan amount. One commentatorquestioned whether a plan could, consistent with the requirement that loansbe available on a reasonably equivalent basis, charge fees for processing,and contract out and charge borrowers for loan administration. Severalcommentators queried whether loans are available on a reasonably equivalentbasis where the loan program restricts accounts from which loans can bemade. None of these limitations and conditions necessarily contravene the conditionsof section 408(b)(1) of the Act or the provisions of this regulation. Suchlimitations, however, would have to be examined to determine whether inpractice (1) the limitation is the basis for loans being unreasonably withheldfrom any applicant, and (2) the loan program, through such limitation,excludes large numbers of plan participants from receiving loans underthe program, thereby raising the issue of whether the program meets therequirement of section 408(b)(1)(B) of the Act and andSection; 2550.408b-1(c)of the regulation. In general, the Department does not believe that it is feasible to seta ``safe harbor'' with regard to permissible limitations in the areas mentionedabove. However, based on the comments received and the testimony givenconcerning the proposal, it appears that many participant loan programscurrently require a minimum loan amount due to administrative cost. Thus,in this regard, the Department has amended the regulation by adding andSection;2550.408b-1(b)(2) which provides that a participant loan program will notfail the requirements of andSection;andSection; 2550.408b-1 (b)(1) or (c) ifthe program establishes a minimum loan amount of up to $1000, providedthat the loans granted by the program meet the requirements of andSection;2550.408b-1(f) concerning adequate security.C. Highly Compensated EmployeesSection 408(b)(1)(B) states that the relief provided in section 408(b)(1)is available only if participant loans are not made available to highlycompensated employees, officers, or shareholders \9\<NOTE/> in an amount greater than the amount made available to otheremployees. With regard to this provision, the legislative history indicatesa Congressional intent to allow plans to lend the same percentage of aperson's vested benefits to participants with both large and small amountsof accrued vested benefits, or to lend the same dollar amounts if securityother than the vested benefit is provided. <T3>See</T3> Conf. Rpt., <T3>supra,</T3> at 312; Legis. Hist., <T3>supra,</T3> at 4579. In light of the expressed Congressional intent,proposed andSection; 2550.408b-1(c)(2) stated that a participant loan programwould not fail to meet this requirement merely because the plan documentsspecifically governing the participant loan program set forth either (i)a maximum dollar limitation, or (ii) a maximum percentage of vested accruedbenefit which no loan may exceed. If the second alternative (maximum percentageof vested accrued benefit) is chosen, the proposal explained that a loanprogram would not fail to meet this requirement solely because maximumloan amounts varied directly with the size of the participant's vestedaccrued benefit.\1\\0\<NOTE/> Section 2550.408b-1(c)(1) of the proposed regulation madeit clear, however, that a loan program will satisfy the requirements ofthis paragraph if the program does not operate to exclude large numbersof plan participants from receiving loans.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ See footnote 1 <T3>infra.</T3><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\ The Department notes that the Internal Revenue Code(the Code) places a number of restrictions on participant loans for taxpurposes. Under section 72(p) of the Code, a participant loan will be treatedas a taxable distribution from the plan unless such loan does not exceedthe lesser of: (i) $50,000 (which amount must be reduced by the outstandingbalances for any previous participant loans from the plan in accordancewith section 72(p)(2)(A)(i)); or (ii) one-half of the present value ofthe nonforfeitable accrued benefit of the employee under the plan (butnot less than $10,000). It is the view of the Department that a participantloan program administered pursuant to plan provisions which have been amendedto preclude the making of loans which would be considered distributionsunder section 72(p) of the Code will not fail, by virtue of those provisions,to satisfy the condition in section 408(b)(1)(B) of the Act and andSection;2550.408b-1(c) of this regulation.<ITAG tagnum="28">The Department also notes that a determination that a particular planloan program meets the requirements of andSection; 2550.408b-1(c) will notdetermine the status of that plan's loan program under Code section 401(a)(4).</ITAG>The Department received no substantive comment on this paragraph, and thus,this paragraph is published in final as proposed. Numerous commentatorsdid, however, request a Departmental view as to fiduciary liability, ifany, in those cases where in order to comply with the Department's articulatedrequirements of adequate security and reasonable rate of interest, a loanprogram, in operation, excludes a large number of plan participants fromreceiving loans. In part, the Department believes that the concern of thesecommentators may be answered by the clarifications contained in this finalregulation concerning the adequate security and reasonable rate of interestrequirements. In addition, as evidenced by the legislative history, Congressclearly believed that loan programs could be conducted under the rulesspecified within section 408(b)(1), as well as the general ERISA fiduciaryrules which govern other plan investments, and still operate in a non-discriminatorymanner. Thus, by definition, loan programs which meet the requirementsconcerning reasonable rate of interest and adequate security will not bedeemed discriminatory for purposes of the provisions of either section408(b)(1) (A) or (B) of the Act solely by reason of compliance with therequirements of section 408(b)(1) (D) and (E) of the Act and the correspondingprovisions of this regulation.D. Specific Plan ProvisionsSection 408(b)(1)(C) of the Act requires that participant loans be madein accordance with specific provisions regarding such loans set forth inthe plan. Under the proposed regulation at andSection; 2550.408b-1(d), allparticipant loan programs must be established pursuant to specific authorityprovided in a plan document. Additionally, a participant loan program whichis contained in the plan or in a written document forming part of the planmust include, but need not be limited to, the following: (1) The identityof the person or positions authorized to administer the participant loanprogram; (2) a procedure for applying for loans; (3) the basis on whichloans will be approved or denied; (4) limitations (if any) on the typesand amounts of loans offered; (5) the procedure under the program for determininga reasonable rate of interest; (6) the types of collateral which may securea participant loan; and (7) the events constituting default and the stepsthat will be taken to preserve plan assets in the event of such default.The proposal further specified that if a plan fails either to contain suchspecific provisions or to administer participant loans in accordance witha written program, loans made under such a program will fail to qualifyfor the relief extended in section 408(b)(1).Under the proposed regulation, the specific terms enumerated above wouldapply to loans granted or renewed at any time on or after the last dayof the first plan year beginning on or after January 1, 1989. Until thatdate, the Department will consider loans to satisfy the requirement ofsection 408(b)(1)(C) if the plan contains an explicit authorization forthe establishment of a participant loan program. Example (1) of this paragraphalso stated that the specific provisions describing the loan program, whethercontained in the plan or in a written document forming part of the plan,affect the rights and obligations of the participants and beneficiariesunder the plan and therefore must, in accordance with section 102(a)(1),be disclosed in the plan's summary plan description (SPD).The Department received numerous comments seeking clarification as to whattypes of documents would satisfy the requirements of this subsection. Severalcommentators asked whether the SPD itself would be considered ``a writtendocument forming part of the plan'' and, thus, satisfy the requirementsof andSection; 2550.408b-1(d) of this regulation. Others asked whether theregulation would require that the summary plan description disclose allspecific plan loan provisions.As indicated in Example (1) of andSection; 2550.408b-1(d), the Departmentanticipates that the specific loan provisions under which the loan programis operated in many cases will not be contained in the plan itself butrather in a separate document forming part of the plan. The Departmentcan find no reason to limit descriptively the range of documents whichmay form part of the plan. Thus, the Department sees no reason why an SPDcould not satisfy the conditions of andSection; 2550.408b-1(d) if it containsthe required loan program provisions and is a document forming part ofthe plan. With regard to the extent to which loan program provisions mustbe disclosed in the SPD, the Department notes that section 102 of ERISArequires that the SPD be sufficiently accurate and comprehensive to reasonablyapprise participants and beneficiaries of their rights and obligationsunder the plan. In this regard, it is the opinion of the Department thatsatisfaction of the requirements of section 102 would, at a minimum, requiresummary disclosures with respect to those items listed in andSection; 2550.408b-1(d)(2).\1\\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\1\ Depending on the facts and circumstances of any particularloan program, the list of items required by andSection; 2550.408b-1(d) maynot, alone, adequately describe the rights and obligations of participantsof that plan, and, hence, additional information may be required.The Department also received many comments arguing that the Departmentshould require less detail in the plan documents because of the changingnature of loan programs and the expense of plan amendments. Several commentatorsopined that section 408(b)(1)(C) of the Act should not be read to requirethat such things as loan application procedures, interest rates and typesof security be included.In this regard, the Department reiterates that the specific terms enumeratedin andSection; 2550.408b-1(d)(2) may be included in a separate written documentforming part of the plan. Also, it is the view of the Department that therequirements of this paragraph of the regulation are sufficiently generalto permit plan provisions to be framed in a manner which would limit thenumber of plan amendments. For example, andSection; 2550.408b-1(d)(2) doesnot require the inclusion in the plan of the actual rate of interest orthe actual loan application form, but merely the general procedures fordetermining the interest rate and for applying for a loan.A number of commentators indicated that sponsors of master and prototypeplans would have difficulty complying with the requirements of andSection;2550.408b-1(d) of the regulation because these types of plans have no effectivemechanism for setting forth the specific provisions required in the regulation.It was suggested that special guidance be developed for these plans andthat, if necessary, a later effective date should be provided for amendmentsto such plans.The Department believes that there is no basis in the statute to concludethat participants and beneficiaries of master or prototype plans are entitledto less specific disclosure of their rights and benefits under their planthan participants of other types of plans. Thus, the final regulation containsno special rules for these plans. Lastly, the Department believes thatthe grace period for compliance with this paragraph should be sufficientto accommodate the adoption of any necessary changes to master and prototypeplans, as well as other types of plans.E. Reasonable Rate of Interest Section 408(b)(1)(D) of the Act states that, in order for a loan to becovered by the relief provided by section 408(b)(1), such loan must beara reasonable rate of interest. In line with the Department's view thata participant loan is a plan investment, andSection; 2550.408b-1(e) of theproposed regulation provided that a reasonable rate of interest is onewhich provides the plan with a return commensurate with the prevailinginterest rate charged on similar commercial loans by persons in the businessof lending money. This standard was first described in Advisory Opinion81-12A\12\<NOTE/> and reflects the relevant legislative history and the practiceunder the Internal Revenue Code prior to the enactment of ERISA.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ Advisory Opinion 81-12A (letter to Robert Georgine, January15, 1981) (A.0. 81-12A).  In A.O. 81-12A, the Department expressed its view that Congress intendedto incorporate into 408(b)(1) the objective prevailing rate standard underexisting IRS regulations. The Department described the prevailing ratestandard as a composite of what persons and institutions in the businessof lending money would obtain as compensation for the use of money whichthey lend under similar circumstances. The Department noted that the prevailingrate standard permits a fiduciary to consider those factors pertainingto the opportunity for gain and the risk of loss that professional lenderswould consider   in setting the rate of interest on a similar arm's-lengthloan, and emphasized that a participant loan as a plan investment wouldnot be prudent if it provided a plan with less return, relative to risk,than comparable investments available to the plan, or if it involved agreater risk to the security of plan assets than other investments offeringa similar return. The Department's approach was not followed in <T3>Brock </T3>v. <T3>Walton </T3>794 F.2d 586 (11th Cir. 1986), where the Court of Appealsheld that a rate 2\1/8\ percent lower than the prevailing rate in the communitywas neither imprudent under section 404(a)(1) of the Act nor unreasonablefor purposes of 408(b)(1). After a careful review of the court's opinion,the Department issued the proposed regulation which adhered to the positionthat Congress intended participant loans to be treated as any other planinvestment and, thus, governed by the objective prevailing rate standard.Although several commentators agreed with the Department's position withrespect to defined benefit plans, the Department received many commentsarguing that less than commercial rates should be permitted for participantloan programs in individual account-type plans. In general, commentatorsdisagreed both with the concept that participant loans are solely planinvestments and with the position that for investment purposes prevailingcommercial rates are the appropriate points of comparison. Many commentatorsargued that Congress did not intend that plans be required to charge theprevailing market rates of interest. Most in this group contended thatthe DOL should follow the <T3>Brock </T3>v. <T3>Walton </T3>rule that ``reasonable rate'' doesn't have to be prevailingmarket rate of interest.\13\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\13\ In this regard, some commentators argued that the Departmentis required to follow <T3>Brock </T3>v. <T3>Walton, </T3>in part, because the Department did not seek review bythe Supreme Court. To the contrary, the government is not bound to alterits national policy based on an adverse Court of Appeals decision. Sucha rule would serve to prevent the development of important questions oflaw by giving the first decision preclusive effect on a particular issue.<T3>United States </T3>v. <T3>Mendoza, </T3>464 U.S. 154, 160 (1984). In addition, the governmentis not required to seek Supreme Court review in order to preserve its position,particularly on the first adverse decision, in part because the Court'sgeneral practice is to review cases only after a conflict among the Circuitshas developed. <T3>See </T3>S.Ct. Rule 17.1(a).  After due consideration of these comments, the Department continues tobelieve that the law of trusts establishes an objective standard of fiduciaryconduct which has been incorporated by Congress in ERISA and applied innumerous cases thereunder. <T3>See, e g., Donovan </T3>v. <T3>Cunningham, </T3>716 F.2d 1455, 1467-68 (5th Cir. 1983), <T3>cert. denied, </T3>467 U.S. 1251 (1984); <T3>Donovan </T3>v. <T3>Mazzola, </T3>716 F.2d 1226, 1231-32 (9th Cir. 1983), <T3>cert. denied, </T3>464 U.S. 1040 (1984); <T3>Freund </T3>v. <T3>Marshall andamp; Ilsley Bank, </T3>485 F. Supp. 629, 635 (W.D. Wisc.1979). In addition, as noted in the preamble to the proposed regulation,the legislative history clearly indicates that in section 408(b)(1) Congressprovided an exemption from the prohibited   transaction rules for participantloans ``following current practice.'' Conf. Rpt., <T3>supra </T3>at 310-11. In discussing the state of the law prior to thepassage of ERISA, Congress noted:<ITAG tagnum="21">Under the Internal Revenue Code, qualified retirement plans must befor the exclusive benefit of the employees and their beneficiaries. Followingthis requirement, the Internal Revenue Service has developed general rulesthat govern the investment of plan assets including a requirement thatcost must not exceed fair market value at the time of the purchase, <T3>there must be a fair return commensurate with the prevailing rate,</T3>sufficient liquidity must be maintained to permit distributions, andthe safeguards and diversity that a prudent investor would adhere to mustbe present.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T3>Id. </T3>at 302 (Emphasis added.) See 26 U.S.C. 503(b)(1) (1970), Treas.Reg. 26 CFR 1.503(b)-1(c) (1960). Further, although Congress clearly intended,through the enactment of section 408(b)(1) to permit certain parties ininterest, i.e., plan participants, to engage in what would otherwise beprohibited transactions involving plan assets, it is the opinion of theDepartment that Congress also clearly intended that the exemption wouldhave no effect with respect to the requirements of the basic fiduciaryresponsibility rules. Conf. Rpt., <T3>supra, </T3>at 310-11; Legis. Hist., <T3>supra, </T3>at 4577-78. Based on the above, the Department issued A.O.81-12A in which it concluded that both sections 404 and 408(b)(1) requireparticipant loans to be treated as other plan investments, and that prevailingcommercial loan rates are to be the appropriate benchmarks for determininga reasonable rate of interest. After careful review of the comments, theDepartment has determined to adhere to this longstanding interpretation.\14\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\14\ Many commentators also argued that under the ``factsand circumstances'' prudent person test of A.O. 81-12A, a below-prevailingrate of interest is permissible for participant loans which are both securedby participants' vested accrued benefits and repaid through payroll deduction.It is the Department's view that these factors may not be relied upon tojustify the granting of loans at less than the prevailing rate. The Departmentdoes, however, wish to clarify that plan fiduciaries may choose a loanrate which reflects these factors, to the same extent that commercial loanrates would, and fall within the narrow range of the prevailing rate.Other commentators stated that requiring the use of commercial rates isparticularly inappropriate where a loan is in effect a self-directed investment,the investment experience of which is attributable only to the participant.In the Department's view, there is no basis in the statute for departingfrom the position that participant loans should function as plan investments,whether the investment return is used to provide benefits to one participantor to all covered participants. Moreover, it is the opinion of the Departmentthat the primary purpose of a pension plan is to provide the benefit ofretirement income not to make participant loans.\15\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\15\ In this regard, a number of commentators urged that alltypes of plans be permitted to use less than prevailing rates in recognitionof the plan loan as an incidental benefit of, and in the case of some plans,incentive for, plan participation. In the Department's view, this suggestionis not compatible with the express intent of Congress that participantloans be governed by the general rules of fiduciary responsibility, whichrequire that participant loans function as other plan investments. In addition,adopting the view that a participant loan is an incidental benefit wouldconstitute a major departure from the purpose of pension plans_to provideretirement income. Also, in the case of plans in which individual benefitsare based on the investment experience of the general pool of plan assets,such an approach may be unfair to those participants who do not take outloans. Lastly, the Department does not believe that the purpose of theexemption is to encourage borrowing from retirement plans but rather topermit it in circumstances that are not likely to either diminish the borrower'sretirement income or cause loss to the plan. Many commentators sought clarification on how to determine the rate ofinterest, and how often it should be adjusted. A majority of the commentatorsargued that ascertaining the prevailing market rate would be administrativelyinfeasible, and that the Department should adopt a standard rate such asthe applicable federal rate, a GIC rate, prime or prime plus rate, ratescomparable to other plan returns, or state usury law rates. Other commentatorsargued that plans administered on a nationwide basis should not be requiredto charge different rates of interest in different locales. Providing a standard ``safe harbor'' interest rate would not be compatiblewith the Department's view that a ``reasonable rate of interest'' is onewhich provides the plan with a return commensurate with the prevailinginterest rate charged by persons in the business of lending money for loanswhich would be made under similar circumstances. A Departmentally-establishedstandard rate would also run counter to the Department's view of a participantloan as an investment subject to the same standards of ERISA as any otherinvestment, <T3>e.g., </T3>the prudence and exclusive benefit rules. Such a standardrate would also ignore the fact that the commercially prevailing rate mayvary based on certain factors, <T3>e.g., </T3>creditworthiness of the borrower and the security givenfor the loan. Indeed, the Department believes that no one particular standardrate will consistently reflect the appropriate risk relative to returnratio for all plans and all participant loans. Thus, with respect to settingloan rates, the Department suggests that plan administrators conduct thesame type of inquiry that would be prudent prior to making any other typeof investment. With respect to geographical differences in the market rates, the Departmentbelieves that administrative costs may justify the adoption of a nationalrate of interest by a plan which is administered on a nationwide basis.Such a plan may also grant loans on a regional basis at rates which reflectappropriate regional factors. In the case of a plan which is not a planadministered on a nationwide basis, the Department believes that an appropriatedetermination of the ``reasonable rate of interest'' must be based on appropriateregional factors. A number of commentators questioned Example (3) of proposed andSection; 2550.408b-1(e)which states that a plan may not limit the rate of interest to the stateusury limit if commercial institutions not subject to the usury laws arecharging higher rates. According to these commentators, this places a plansponsor in the untenable position of being forced to choose between complyingwith state usury laws or with the Department's regulation. In this regard,the Department notes that ERISA contains no mandate requiring ERISA-coveredplans to provide loan programs for their participants; thus, there is noabsolute conflict between state usury laws and ERISA. The Department continuesto adhere to its position that a ``reasonable rate of interest'' is onewhich provides the plan with a return commensurate with the prevailinginterest rate charged by persons in the business of lending money for loanswhich would be made under similar circumstances. Also, because participantloans are plan investments, a participant loan program which limits itsinterest rate to a maximum state usury ceiling when higher yielding comparableinvestment opportunities exist may not meet the requirements of ERISA section403(c) and 404(a). G. Adequate Security Section 408(b)(1)(E) of the Act states that the relief provided by paragraph408(b)(1) will apply only to loans that are adequately secured. Based onsimilar IRS regulations, the Department proposed andSection; 2550.408b-1(f)which provided a test for the adequacy of the security similar to thatwhich would be required by a commercial lender. The proposed regulationmade it clear that in the participant loan context, the security must besuch that, in the event of default, the participant's retirement incomeis preserved and loss to the plan is prevented. The proposal indicatedthat at least a portion of a participant's vested accrued benefit underthe plan may be used as security to the extent that it meets this test.Citing to the spousal consent requirements of ERISA and the Code, the Departmentalso suggested in the preamble to the proposed regulation that restrictionson distributions in qualified plans could affect the adequacy of vestedaccrued benefits as security. Virtually all commentators on this paragraph of the regulation requestedclarification that vested accrued benefits could serve as adequate securityfor participant loans. Most of these commentators made their argumentswith respect to loan programs administered by individual account plansunder which principal and interest payments made on any particular participant'sloan would be allocated totally to that same participant's account. Sincein such plans any loss would be suffered only by the participant borrower,it was argued that the restrictions on timing of foreclosure due to theCode restrictions on in-service distributions should not affect the adequacyof accrued benefits as security. If such plans also require repayment bypayroll deduction, it was argued that an account balance should be consideredadequate security, at least in these types of plans, even though defaultcould not occur until a distributable event, <T3>i.e.,</T3> termination of service. Other commentators suggested thatvested accrued benefits in either a defined benefit or defined contributionplan could be considered adequate as security if its value was discountedto take into account any time lag between a default and actual enforcementof the security interest. Another commentator suggested that an employer'sguarantee of participant loans should provide the Department a basis fordetermining that vested accrued benefits are adequate security. In contrast, a number of commentators agreed that loans from defined benefitplans or other plans in which each participant's benefit is based on ashare of the plan's pooled asset investment experience might require collateralbeyond that required for loans from individual account plans in order toassure that the plan suffer no loss in the event of default.In light of the comments, the Department has made the following amendmentsand clarifications to andSection; 2550.408b-1(f). In the Department's view,Congress clearly intended that at least a portion of a participant's vestedaccrued benefit be a permissible form of security, <T3>see, e.g., </T3>Conf. Rpt., <T3>supra, </T3>at 312; <T3>reprinted in </T3>Legis. Hist., <T3>supra, </T3>at 4579. But in that regard, Congress also clearly intendedthat the security given must be adequate in commercial terms. <T3>Id. </T3>Because of the overriding concern for protecting the planfrom loss and thus preserving the participant's retirement income, theDepartment has determined to retain the general requirement that the securityfor all participant loans be such that the plan will suffer no loss ofprincipal or income if a default occurs. However, with regard to plan loanprograms which intend to accept a participant's vested accrued benefitas security, the Department has also established a cap which places anupper limit on the amount of the vested accrued benefit which the planadministrator may consider for purposes of determining adequate securityfor participant loans made pursuant to section 408(b)(1). Specifically,the final regulation permits up to fifty percent of the present value ofa participant's vested accrued benefit to be used as security for participantloans and taken into account in determining whether the security is adequate,leaving the remaining account balance unencumbered.\16\<NOTE/> Thus, immediately after the origination of any participantloan to be secured in whole or in part by the vested accrued benefit, theamount of the participant's vested accrued benefit actually being consideredas security for the outstanding balance of that participant's loans maynot exceed the 50% cap. A participant loan program may, however, grantparticipant loans which require aggregate security in excess of the fiftypercent cap provided that the plan receives additional collateral the valueof which equals or exceeds the amount required in excess of the cap. TheDepartment believes this cap is necessary to assure that the primary purposeof a pension plan is achieved_to provide retirement income for plan participants.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\16\ The Department chose to correspond the cap to one ofthe upper limits imposed by section 72(p)(2)(A)(ii) of the Code, beyondwhich participant loans will be treated as taxable distributions. The Departmentwishes to note, however, that it is not adopting the provisions of section72(p) as requirements of this regulatory exemption. Like the proposal, the final regulation does not require enforcement ofthe security interest held by a plan at any particular time after a defaultby a participant borrower. Section 2550.408b-1(f)(1), however, does requirethat in order for the security posted for the loan to be considered adequate,(1) the plan must have the ability to foreclose on, or sell, or otherwisedispose of it in the case of default; and (2) the value of the securitymust be such that it can be reasonably anticipated that the plan will notsuffer a loss of principal or interest from the loan due to the actualdate of enforcement of the security interest resulting from a default.The requirement that the plan have the ability to foreclose on the securityinterest in the case of default does not require that the plan have theability to foreclose immediately upon default. For example, where a portionof the vested accrued benefit is used as security, the plan's ability toenforce the security interest immediately upon default is not requiredas long as no loss of principal or income will occur to the plan due tothe delay of such enforcement. Similarly, in the case of collateral otherthan a participant's vested accrued benefit, the Department is of the opinionthat it is within the plan fiduciary's discretion to determine whetherit is prudent to extend the date of enforcement of the security interest,as long as no loss of principal or interest occurs. For plans which accept a portion of the vested accrued benefit as security,the Department understands that the effect of the ``no loss'' requirementwill vary depending upon the type of plan. With regard to plans in whichthe investment experience of the plan's assets is shared by all participantsor used to fund the benefits of all plan participants, additional loanprogram requirements in conjunction with the pledging of a portion of theparticipant's vested accrued benefit may be necessary in order to assure``no loss'' of principal and interest to the plan. For example, a loanprogram in a 401(k) plan in which the investment experience is shared mightmeet this ``no loss'' requirement by using a portion of a participant'saccount balance as security in conjunction with mandatory payroll deductionrepayment which would stop only upon the happening of a distributable event,<T3>i.e.,</T3> retirement, separation from service or death. In addition,discounting the value of the vested accrued benefit to take into accountthe time delay between any possible default and the first distributableevent for that participant's benefit may be another viable way of meetingthe ``no loss'' adequate security requirement. ERISA's general fiduciaryrequirements may also require a plan administrator of a defined benefitplan who intends to use a portion of a participant's vested accrued benefitas security to consider additional factors such as the funding of the planin determining the amount that may be borrowed based on the vested accruedbenefit. However, where a plan provides an individual account for eachparticipant and the investment experience of the assets contributed tothat account is attributable solely to that plan participant's account,any participant who has a vested accrued benefit may borrow up to 50% ofthe present value of the vested accrued benefit secured by that 50% ofthe vested account balance. For example, a participant who has a vestedaccrued benefit the present value of which is $10,000 may borrow up to$5,000, secured by 50% of his vested account balance, <T3>i.e., </T3>$5,000, and meet the terms of andSection;andSection; 2550.408b-1(f)(1) and (2). Finally, it was suggested that an employer guarantee of a participant loanmight be a means of adequately securing the loan. In this regard, if requested,the Department will consider the issues surrounding this subject in thecontext of specific guarantee arrangements submitted for review. H. Effective Date Proposed andSection; 2550.408b-1(g) of the regulation stated that, if adopted,the regulation would generally be effective January 1, 1975, except thatandSection; 2550.408b-1(d)(2) relating to specific plan provisions wouldbe effective for loans granted or renewed on or after the last day of thefirst plan year beginning on or after January 1, 1989. Many of the comments received by the Department urged that all provisionsof the regulations be made prospective in effect, contending that it wouldbe unfair to issue retroactive regulations which are inconsistent withcurrent practice both as to rates of interest and the security required,and which may impose substantial liability on plan fiduciaries and causepossible disqualification of plans. Other commentators suggested that theeffective date be extended to include the time which plans will need tocomply with the Tax Reform Act of 1986. One commentator stated that theretroactive effective date was reasonable except as applied to existingloans designed to be reloaned to the plan sponsor since, in the commentator'sview, the Department has not definitively called this practice a prohibitedtransaction. Another commentator opined that the regulations should beprospective because plans are complying with state usury laws.In support, commentators noted that the 1974 legislative history of ERISAgave permission to continue current practice which various commentatorsbelieved to include use of lower than prevailing rates of interest anduse of distribution-restricted vested accrued benefits as security forloans. With respect to the proposed definition of reasonable rate of interest,many commentators stated that the proposed regulation is inconsistent withA.O. 81-12A, which commentators contend led plans to believe that usingless than prevailing rates was permissible. Commentators also assertedthat many plans reasonably relied upon the 1986 <T3>Brock </T3>v. <T3>Walton </T3>decision where the Eleventh Circuit approved a participantloan rate less than the prevailing rate. Some commentators suggested thata grace period be given plans so that they would have the opportunity tocome into compliance with the regulation. Others suggested that existingplan loans be ``grandfathered,'' <T3>i.e., </T3>not be required to change their terms. In response, the Department believes that the clarifications containedin this final regulation may alleviate some of the commentators' concernabout the effective date of the regulation. It also believes, however,that many plans have in good faith attempted to follow the terms of theexemption but may not meet the precise terms contained in this final regulation.Section 2550.408b-1(g) has therefore been amended to provide that withthe exception of the provisions of andSection; 2550.408b-1(d)(2), the regulationwill be effective for all new or renewed loans 90 days from the publicationdate of this final regulation.\17\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\17\ The Department notes that making the regulation prospectivein effect does not necessarily create an inference that all existing loanprograms are <T3>per se </T3>acceptable. For instance, the Department may find thatcertain existing loan arrangements are non-exempt prohibited transactions,based not on the regulation, but on the Department's longstanding interpretationof the reasonable rate of interest requirement, as contained in A.O. 81-12Aand as argued in <T3>Brock </T3>v. <T3>Walton, </T3>794 F.2d 586 (11th Cir. 1986). Consequently, the Departmentwill continue to bring enforcement actions aimed at participant loans madeprior to the effective date of the regulation at below prevailing rates.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291 Statement </ITAG>The final rule in this document is not classified as a ``major rule'' underExecutive Order 12291 on Federal Regulations, because it is not likelyto result in (1) an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more;(2) a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; or(3) significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.The action will impose some costs on employee benefit plans. These costshave been estimated to be one-time costs of just under $18 million andsubsequent annual costs of less than $150,000.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act Statement </ITAG>The Department has determined that this final regulation would not havea significant economic impact on small entities. The purpose of this regulationis to provide guidance to employee benefit plans and their sponsors andadmini-strators who wish to provide a participant loan program to theirplan participants and beneficiaries. A number of commentators suggestedthat the Department had underestimated the cost of implementing a participantloan program under the regulation. In conducting the analysis requiredunder the Regulatory Flexibility Act, it was determined that several aspectsof the final regulation will serve to alleviate their concerns. First,many commentators projected higher costs based on misinterpretations ofthe proposed regulation's requirements under ERISA section 408(b)(1)(E),relating to adequate security. Second, the Department anticipates that, given the nature of the requirementsof ERISA section 408(b)(l) as clarified by the regulation, employee benefitservice providers will be able to develop standardized language for inclusionin plan documents and summary plan descriptions, thereby reducing costsincurred by individual plan sponsors. Finally, it should be noted thatno plan sponsor is required under section 408(b)(1) of ERISA, or the regulation,to provide for a loan program as part of a plan; thus, only those plansponsors voluntarily adopting loan programs will be affected by the regulation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act Statement </ITAG>Section 2550.408b-1(d) of the final regulation contains a paperwork requirementwhich has been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under theprovisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub.

Therefore,all references herein to section 408(b)(1) of the Act should be read toinclude reference to the parallel provisions of section 4975(d)(1) of theCode.Section 1114(b)(15)(B) of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 amended section 408(b)(1)(B)of ERISA by deleting the phrase ``highly compensated employees, officersor shareholders'' and substituting the phrase ``highly compensated employees(within the meaning of section 414(q) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986).''Thus, for plans with participant loan programs which are subject to theamended section 408(b)(1)(B), the requirements of this regulation shouldbe read to conform with the amendment. (2) <T3>Scope.</T3> Section 408(b)(1) of the Act does not contain an exemptionfrom acts described in section 406(b)(3) of the Act (prohibiting fiduciariesfrom receiving consideration for their own personal account from any partydealing with a plan in connection with a transaction involving plan assets).If a loan from a plan to a participant who is a party in interest withrespect to that plan involves an act described in section 406(b)(3), suchan act constitutes a separate transaction which is not exempt under section408(b)(1) of the Act. The provisions of section 408(b)(1) are further limitedby section 408(d) of the Act (relating to transactions with owner-employeesand related persons). (3) <T3>Loans.</T3> (i) Section 408(b)(1) of the Act provides relief from theprohibitions of section 406(a), 406(b)(1) and 406(b)(2) for the makingof a participant loan. The term ``participant loan'' refers to a loan whichis arranged and approved by the fiduciary administering the loan programprimarily in the interest of the participant and which otherwise satisfiesthe criteria set forth in section 408(b)(1) of the Act. The existence ofa participant loan or participant loan program will be determined uponconsideration of all relevant facts and circumstances. Thus, for example,the mere presence of a loan document appearing to satisfy the requirementsof section 408(b)(1) will not be dispositive of whether a participant loanexists where the subsequent administration of the loan indicates that theparties to the loan agreement did not intend the loan to be repaid. Moreover,a loan program containing a precondition designed to benefit a party ininterest (other than the participant) is not afforded relief by section408(b)(1) or this regulation. In this regard, section 408(b)(1) recognizesthat a program of participant loans, like other plan investments, mustbe prudently established and administered for the exclusive purpose ofproviding benefits to participants and beneficiaries of the plan.(ii) For the purpose of this regulation, the term ``loan'' will includeany renewal or modification of an existing loan agreement, provided that,at the time of each such renewal or modification, the requirements of section408(b)(1) and this regulation are met. (4) <T3>Examples. </T3>The following examples illustrate the provisions ofandSection; 2550.408b-1(a).<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Example (1): </T4>T, a trustee of plan P, has exclusive discretionover the management and disposition of plan assets. As a result, T is afiduciary with respect to P under section 3(21)(A) of the Act and a partyin interest with respect to P pursuant to section 3(14)(A) of the Act.T is also a participant in P. Among T's duties as fiduciary is the administrationof a participant loan program which meets the requirements of section 408(b)(1)of the Act. Pursuant to strict objective criteria stated under the program,T, who participates in all loan decisions, receives a loan on the sameterms as other participants. Although the exercise of T's discretion onbehalf of himself may constitute an act of self-dealing described in section406(b)(1), section 408(b)(1) provides an exemption from section 406(b)(1).As a result, the loan from P to T would be exempt under section 408(b)(1),provided the conditions of that section are otherwise satisfied. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Example (2): </T4>P is a plan covering all the employees of E, theemployer who established and maintained P. F is a fiduciary with respectto P and an officer of E. The plan documents governing P give F the authorityto establish a participant loan program in accordance with section 408(b)(1)of the Act. Pursuant to an arrangement with E, F establishes such a programbut limits the use of loan funds to investments in a limited partnershipwhich is established and maintained by E as general partner. Under thesefacts, the loan program and any loans made pursuant to this program areoutside the scope of relief provided by section 408(b)(1) because the loanprogram is designed to operate for the benefit of E. Under the circumstancesdescribed, the diversion of plan assets for E's benefit would also violatesections 403(c)(1) and 404(a) of the Act. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Example (3): </T4>Assume the same facts as in Example 2, above, exceptthat F does not limit the use of loan funds. However, E pressures his employeesto borrow funds under P's participant loan program and then reloan theloan proceeds to E. F, unaware of E's activities, arranges and approvesthe loans. If the loans meet all the conditions of section 408(b)(1), suchloans will be exempt under that section. However, E's activities wouldcause the entire transaction to be viewed as an indirect transfer of planassets between P and E, who is a party in interest with respect to P, butnot the participant borrowing from P. By coercing the employees to engagein loan transactions for its benefit, E has engaged in separate transactionsthat are not exempt under section 408(b)(1). Accordingly, E would be liablefor the payment of excise taxes under section 4975 of the Code. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Example (4): </T4>Assume the same facts as in Example 2, above, exceptthat, in return for structuring and administering the loan program as indicated,E agrees to pay F an amount equal to 10 percent of the funds loaned underthe program. Such a payment would result in a separate transaction notcovered by section 408(b)(1). This transaction would be prohibited undersection 406(b)(3) since F would be receiving consideration from a partyin connection with a transaction involving plan assets. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Example (5): </T4>F is a fiduciary with respect to plan P. D is a partyin interest with respect to plan P. Section 406(a)(1)(B) of the Act wouldprohibit F from causing P to lend money to D. However, F enters into anagreement with Z, a plan participant, whereby F will cause P to make aparticipant loan to Z with the express understanding that Z will subsequentlylend the loan proceeds to D. An examination of Z's credit standing indicatesthat he is not creditworthy and would not, under normal circumstances,receive a loan under the conditions established by the participant loanprogram. F's decision to approve the participant loan to Z on the basisof Z's prior agreement to lend the money to D violates the exclusive purposerequirements of sections 403(c) and 404(a). In effect, the entire transactionis viewed as an indirect transfer of plan assets between P and D, and nota loan to a participant exempt under section 408(b)(1). Z's lack of creditstanding would also cause the transaction to fail under section 408(b)(1)(A)of the Act. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Example (6): </T4>F is a fiduciary with respect to Plan P. Z is a planparticipant. Z and D are both parties in interest with respect to P. Fapproves a participant loan to Z in accordance with the conditions establishedunder the participant loan program. Upon receipt of the loan, Z intendsto lend the money to D. If F has approved this loan solely upon considerationof those factors which would be considered in a normal commercial settingby an entity in the business of making comparable loans, Z's subsequentuse of the loan proceeds will not affect the determination of whether loansunder P's program satisfy the conditions of section 408(b)(1). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Example (7): </T4>A is the trustee of a small individual account plan.D, the president of the plan sponsor, is also a participant in the plan.Pursuant to a participant loan program meeting the requirements of section408(b)(1), D applies for a loan to be secured by a parcel of real property.D does not intend to repay the loan; rather, upon eventual default, hewill permit the property to be foreclosed upon and transferred to the planin discharge of his legal obligation to repay the loan. A, aware of D'sintention, approves the loan. D fails to make two consecutive quarterlypayments of principal and interest under the note evidencing the loan therebyplacing the loan in default. The plan then acquires the real property uponforeclosure. Such facts and circumstances indicate that the payment ofmoney from the plan to D was not a participant loan eligible for the reliefafforded by section 408(b)(1). In effect, this transaction is a prohibitedsale or exchange of property between a plan and a party in interest fromthe time D receives the money. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Example (8): </T4>Plan P establishes a participant loan program. Allloans are subject to the condition that the borrowed funds must be usedto finance home purchases. Interest rates on the loans are the same asthose charged by a local savings and loan association under similar circumstances.A loan by P to a participant to finance a home purchase would be subjectto the relief provided by section 408(b)(1) provided that the conditionsof 408(b)(1) are met. A participant loan program which is established tomake loans for certain stated purposes (e.g., hardship, college tuition,home purchases, etc.) but which is not otherwise designed to benefit partiesin interest (other than plan participants) would not, in itself, causesuch program to be ineligible for the relief provided by section 408(b)(1).However, fiduciaries are cautioned that operation of a loan program withlimitations may result in loans not being made available to all participantsand beneficiaries on a reasonably equivalent basis.</ITAG>(b) <T3>Reasonably Equivalent Basis. </T3>(1) Loans will not be consideredto have been made available to participants and beneficiaries on a reasonablyequivalent basis unless: (i) Such loans are available to all plan participants and beneficiarieswithout regard to any individual's race, color, religion, sex, age or nationalorigin; (ii) In making such loans, consideration has been given only to those factorswhich would be considered in a normal commercial setting by an entity inthe business of making similar types of loans. Such factors may includethe applicant's creditworthiness and financial need; and (iii) An evaluation of all relevant facts and circumstances indicates that,in actual practice, loans are not unreasonably withheld from any applicant.(2) A participant loan program will not fail the requirement of paragraph(b)(1) of this section or andSection; 2550.408b-1(c) if the program establishesa minimum loan amount of up to $1,000, provided that the loans grantedmeet the requirements of andSection; 2550.408b-1(f).(3) <T3>Examples. </T3>The following examples illustrate the provisions ofandSection; 2550.408b-1(b)(1):<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Example (1): </T4>T, a trustee of plan P, has exclusive discretionover the management and disposition of plan assets. T's duties includethe administration of a participant loan program which meets the requirementsof section 408(b)(1) of the Act. T receives a participant loan at a lowerinterest rate than the rate made available to other plan participants ofsimilar financial condition or creditworthiness with similar security.The loan by P to T would not be covered by the relief provided by section408(b)(1) because loans under P's program are not available to all planparticipants on a reasonably equivalent basis. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Example (2): </T4>Same facts as in example 1, except that T is a memberof a committee of trustees responsible for approving participant loans.T pressures the committee to refuse loans to other qualified participantsin order to assure that the assets allocated to the participant loan programwould be available for a loan by P to T. The loan by P to T would not becovered by the relief provided by section 408(b)(1) since participant loanshave not been made available to all participants and beneficiaries on areasonably equivalent basis. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Example (3): </T4>T is the trustee of plan P, which covers the employeesof E. A, B and C are employees of E, participants in P, and friends ofT. The documents governing P provide that T, in his discretion, may establisha participant loan program meeting certain specified criteria. T institutessuch a program and tells A, B and C of his decision. Before T is able tonotify P's other participants and beneficiaries of the loan program, A,B, and C file loan applications which, if approved, will use up substantiallyall of the funds set aside for the loan program. Approval of these applicationsby T would represent facts and circumstances showing that loans under P'sprogram are not available to all participants and beneficiaries on a reasonablyequivalent basis.</ITAG>(c) <T3>Highly Compensated Employees. </T3>(1) Loans will not be consideredto be made available to highly compensated employees, officers or shareholdersin an amount greater than the amount made available to other employeesif, upon consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances, the programdoes not operate to exclude large numbers of plan participants from receivingloans under the program. (2) A participant loan program will not fail to meet the requirement inparagraph (c)(1), of this section, merely because the plan documents specificallygoverning such loans set forth either (i) a maximum dollar limitation,or (ii) a maximum percentage of vested accrued benefit which no loan mayexceed. (3) If the second alternative in paragraph (3)(c) of this section  (maximumpercentage of vested accrued benefit) is chosen, a loan program will notfail to meet this requirement solely because maximum loan amounts willvary directly with the size of the participant's accrued benefit. (4) <T3>Examples. </T3>The following examples illustrate the provisions ofandSection; 2550.408b-1(c).<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Example (1): </T4>The documents governing plan P provide for the establishmentof a participant loan program in which the amount of any loan under theprogram (when added to the outstanding balances of any other loans underthe program to the same participant) does not exceed the lesser of (i)$50,000, or (ii) one-half of the present value of that participant's vestedaccrued benefit under the plan (but not less than $10,000). P's participantloan program does not fail to meet the requirement in section 408(b)(1)(B)of the Act, and would be covered by the relief provided by section 408(b)(1)if the other conditions of that section are met. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Example (2): </T4>The documents governing plan T provide for the establishmentof a participant loan program in which the minimum loan amount would be$25,000. The documents also require that the only security acceptable underthe program would be the participant's vested accrued benefit. A, the planfiduciary administering the loan program, finds that because of the restrictionsin the plan documents only 20 percent of the plan participants, all ofwhom earn in excess of $75,000 a year, would meet the threshold qualificationsfor a loan. Most of these participants are high-level supervisors or corporateofficers. Based on these facts, it appears that loans under the programwould be made available to highly compensated employees in an amount greaterthan the amount made available to other employees. As a result, the loanprogram would fail to meet the requirement in section 408(b)(1)(B) of theAct and would not be covered by the relief provided in section 408(b)(1).</ITAG>(d) <T3>Specific Plan Provisions. </T3>For the purpose of section 408(b)(1)and this regulation, the Department will consider that participant loansgranted or renewed at any time prior to the last day of the first planyear beginning on or after January 1, 1989, are made in accordance withspecific provisions regarding such loans set forth in the plan if: (1) The plan provisions regarding such loans contain (at a minimum) anexplicit authorization for the plan fiduciary responsible for investingplan assets to establish a participant loan program; and (2) For participant loans granted or renewed on or after the last day ofthe first plan year beginning on or after January 1, 1989, the participantloan program which is contained in the plan or in a written document formingpart of the plan includes, but need not be limited to, the following:(i) The identity of the person or positions authorized to administer theparticipant loan program; (ii) A procedure for applying for loans; (iii) The basis on which loans will be approved or denied; (iv) Limitations (if any) on the types and amount of loans offered; (v) The procedure under the program for determining a reasonable rate ofinterest; (vi) The types of collateral which may secure a participant loan; and (vii) The events constituting default and the steps that will be takento preserve plan assets in the event of such default.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Example (1): </T4>Plan P authorizes the trustee to establish a participantloan program in accordance with section 408(b)(1) of the Act. Pursuantto this explicit authority, the trustee establishes a written program whichcontains all of the information required by andSection; 2550.408b-1(d)(2).Loans made pursuant to this authorization and the written loan programwill not fail under section 408(b)(1)(C) of the Act merely because thespecific provisions regarding such loans are contained in a separate documentforming part of the plan. The specific provisions describing the loan program,whether contained in the plan or in a written document forming part ofa plan, do affect the rights and obligations of the participants and beneficiariesunder the plan and, therefore, must in accordance with section 102(a)(1)of the Act, be disclosed in the plan's summary plan description.</ITAG>(e) <T3>Reasonable Rate of Interest. </T3>A loan will be considered to beara reasonable rate of interest if such loan provides the plan with a returncommensurate with the interest rates charged by persons in the businessof lending money for loans which would be made under similar circumstances.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Example (1): </T4>Plan P makes a participant loan to A at the fixedinterest rate of 8% for 5 years. The trustees, prior to making the loan,contacted two local banks to determine under what terms the banks wouldmake a similar loan taking into account A's creditworthiness and the collateraloffered. One bank would charge a variable rate of 10% adjusted monthlyfor a similar loan. The other bank would charge a fixed rate of 12% undersimilar circumstances. Under these facts, the loan to A would not beara reasonable rate of interest because the loan did not provide P with areturn commensurate with interest rates charged by persons in the businessof lending money for loans which would be made under similar circumstances.As a result, the loan would fail to meet the requirements of section 408(b)(1)(D)and would not be covered by the relief provided by section 408(b)(1) ofthe Act. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Example (2): </T4>Pursuant to the provisions of plan P's participantloan program, T, the trustee of P, approves a loan to M, a participantand party in interest with respect to P. At the time of execution, theloan meets all of the requirements of section 408(b)(1) of the Act. Theloan agreement provides that at the end of two years M must pay the remainingbalance in full or the parties may renew for an additional two year period.At the end of the initial two year period, the parties agree to renew theloan for an additional two years. At the time of renewal, however, A failsto adjust the interest rate charged on the loan in order to reflect currenteconomic conditions. As a result, the interest rate on the renewal failsto provide a ``reasonable rate of interest'' as required by section 408(b)(1)(D)of the Act. Under such circumstances, the loan would not be exempt undersection 408(b)(1) of the Act from the time of renewal. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Example (3): </T4>The documents governing plan P's participant loanprogram provide that loans must bear an interest rate no higher than themaximum interest rate permitted under State X's usury law. Pursuant tothe loan program, P makes a participant loan to A, a plan participant,at a time when the interest rates charged by financial institutions inthe community (not subject to the usury limit) for similar loans are higherthan the usury limit. Under these circumstances, the loan would not beara reasonable rate of interest because the loan does not provide P witha return commensurate with the interest rates charged by persons in thebusiness of lending money under similar circumstances. In addition, participantloans that are artificially limited to the maximum usury ceiling then prevailingcall into question the status of such loans under sections 403(c) and 404(a)where higher yielding comparable investment opportunities are availableto the plan.</ITAG>(f) <T3>Adequate Security. </T3>(1) A loan will be considered to be adequatelysecured if the security posted for such loan is something in addition toand supporting a promise to pay, which is so pledged to the plan that itmay be sold, foreclosed upon, or otherwise disposed of upon default ofrepayment of the loan, the value and liquidity of which security is suchthat it may reasonably be anticipated that loss of principal or interestwill not result from the loan. The adequacy of such security will be determinedin light of the type and amount of security which would be required inthe case of an otherwise identical transaction in a normal commercial settingbetween unrelated parties on arm's-length terms. A participant's vestedaccrued benefit under a plan may be used as security for a participantloan to the extent of the plan's ability to satisfy the participant's outstandingobligation in the event of default. (2) For purposes of this paragraph, (i) no more than 50% of the presentvalue of a participant's vested accrued benefit may be considered by aplan as security for the outstanding balance of all plan loans made tothat participant; (ii) a plan will be in compliance with paragraph (f)(2)(i)of this section if, with respect to any participant, it meets the provisionsof paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section immediately after the originationof each participant loan secured in whole or in part by that participant'svested accrued benefit; and (iii) any loan secured in whole or in partby a portion of a participant's vested accrued benefit must also meet therequirements of paragraph (f)(1) of this section. (g) <T3>Effective date. </T3>This section is effective for all participantloans granted or renewed after October 18, 1989, except with respect toparagraph (d)(2) of this section relating to specific plan provisions.Paragraph (d)(2) of this section is effective for participant loans grantedor renewed on or after the last day of the first plan year beginning onor after January 1, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="20">(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number1210-0076)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Signed this 14th day of July, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Ann L.
