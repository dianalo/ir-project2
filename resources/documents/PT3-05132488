Field of the Invention </PAR><PAR>  This invention relates to electrical telecommunications cable. </PAR><PAR>  2. Description of Prior Art </PAR><PAR>  Telecommunications cable is normally constructed with a core comprising one      or more core units, each having a multiplicity of twisted units of      conductors, each unit conventionally being a twisted pair of conductors. A      core may be formed as a single core unit of twisted pairs. Care is taken,      so far as is practicable, to ensure that pairs of equal or similar twist      lays are separated from each other by other pairs. The reason for this      arrangement is an attempt to maximize the communications performance of      the cable, e.g. to lessen pair-to-pair capacitance unbalance, to reduce      crosstalk between pairs, and to lower the coefficient of deviation of      mutual capacitance of pairs in the cable. To reduce the pair-to-pair      capacitance unbalance and to reduce cross-talk, suggestions have been made      to move the conductor pairs relative to one another as they progress      towards a stranding machine for stranding them into a core unit so that in      the finished core unit, the conductor pairs change in relative positions      and distances apart. In a suggested method for changing the relative      positions of conductor pairs as they move towards the stranding machine,      the conductor pairs enter a guide arrangement which comprises a system of      horizontal guides movable horizontally and located in vertical tiered      fashion. This method was first suggested by S. Norblad of      Telefonaktiebolaget L. M. Ericsson, in a paper entitled &quot;Capacitance      Unbalance Telecommunications Networks&quot; read before the International Wire      and Cable Symposium in 1971. As a result of the use of this method, the      conductor pairs obviously change positions and distances apart in the      finished core and perhaps in a random manner. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The present invention seeks to provide an electrical telecommunications      cable construction in which pair-to-pair capacitance unbalance and      cross-talk is minimized in some other manner. </PAR><PAR>  Accordingly, the present invention provides an electrical      telecommunications cable comprising a plurality of pairs of individually      insulated conductors, the conductors in each pair twisted together, and      spacer means holding the pairs of conductors spaced apart. </PAR><PAR>  The spacer means may be disposed along the axis of the cable or may be      provided by inwardly extending projections of a jacket which surrounds the      cable pairs. </PAR><PAR>  When the spacer means is disposed along the axis of the cable, it may be a      central core member of substantially circular shape. Alternatively, the      central core member may be provided with radially outwardly extending      projections which are spaced apart circumferentially of the core member      and define recess regions between the projections. Each pair of conductors      is disposed in an individual recess region and is separated from other      pairs by the projections. In a further alternative arrangement, the spacer      means comprises a plurality of spokes diverging radially outwards from the      center to define recess regions for the conductors between the spokes. </PAR><PAR>  Where the spacing means is provided by the projections extending inwardly      from the jacket, then these projections are spaced circumferentially      around the jacket to provide spacers and the pairs of conductors are      separated from one another by the projections. In a practical manner of      providing such a structure, the projections converge towards a common      center and have spaced apart inner ends disposed outwardly of the center.      Chambers are thus formed within the jacket and are defined partly by a      circumferentially extending portion of the jacket and two projections      positioned one at each end of the circumferentially extending portion. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  Embodiments of the invention will now be described, by way of example, with      reference to the accompanying drawings, in which: </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a lateral cross-sectional view through a cable according to a      first embodiment; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is a view similar to FIG. 1 of a second embodiment; and </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is a view similar to FIG. 1 of a third embodiment. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </PAC><PAR>  In a first embodiment as shown by FIG. 1, an electrical telecommunications      cable 40 comprises a jacket 42 of suitable polymeric material, the jacket      surrounding four pairs 14 of individually insulated metal (i.e. copper)      conductors 16. The conductors in each pair are twisted together in      conventional manner. The jacket 42 incorporates spacer means for holding      the pairs of conductors in spaced apart positions. The spacer means is      provided by a plurality (namely four) of inwardly extending helically      extending projections 44 spaced apart circumferentially around the jacket.      These projections are integrally formed with the jacket during jacket      extrusion and are equally angularly spaced apart around the axis of the      jacket. The protrusions 44 are tapered radially to inner free ends 46      which are spaced outwardly from the axis of the jacket. This tapering is      effected by concave surfaces which blend from one projection to another so      as to define between adjacent projections recess regions 48 having smooth      concave surfaces. The recess regions have openings 50 facing inwardly      towards the axis of the jacket. Each pair 14 of conductors is housed      within an individual recess 48, as shown, so that the distances between      adjacent pairs is substantially constant along the length of the cable and      with the distances between the pairs being substantially equal and      maintained along the length of the cable. The spacing of the pairs      minimize cross-talk between the pairs and in effect the voltage induced in      the pairs is decreased. Dependent upon the performance requirements of the      cable, the distances between the pairs can be determined for any      particular AWG of conductor and mathematical modelling may be used to      determine these required distances. Further, as may be seen from FIG. 1,      in maintaining the distances between adjacent pairs substantially equal      the induced voltages between the pairs is substantially the same. Hence, a      degree of design control is provided for maintaining the distances between      the conductor pairs constant along the length of the cable and as these      distances are substantially equal from one pair to another, cross-talk      between adjacent pairs is carefully controlled. </PAR><PAR>  In other embodiments now to be described, features of the cable      constructions which are similar to that of the first embodiment and/or to      each other will bear the same reference numerals. </PAR><PAR>  In a second embodiment as shown by FIG. 2, a cable 52 has a jacket 54 also      formed with radially inwardly extending and helically extending      projections 56 of slightly different shape from those shown with regard to      FIG. 1. In the case of the second embodiment the projections 56 extend      with parallel sides radially outwards from their free ends 58 for a      certain distance and then each of the projections increases in thickness      with diverging flat surface areas 60. The surface areas 60 of adjacent      projections 56 are substantially parallel on each side of a recess region      or chamber 62 defined between the surface areas 60 and also by the inside      surface 64 of a circumferentially extending portion of the jacket. Each      recess region 62, which opens in a radially inward direction as described      for the first embodiment above, houses an individual pair 14 of insulated      conductors 16. </PAR><PAR>  In a third embodiment shown by FIG. 3, a cable 66 is of substantially the      same structure as the cable 52. The cable 66 differs basically from cable      52 in that the projections 56 of changing thickness are omitted. Instead,      the cable 66 has spacer means formed by four radially inwardly extending      spokes 68 of constant thickness formed integrally with the jacket.      Radially inwardly extending recess regions or chambers 70 housing      individual conductor pairs 14 are defined between opposite spoke surfaces      and relatively long circumferentially extending portions 72 of jacket 14. </PAR><PAR>  In each of the embodiments described above, the pairs of conductors around      the cable from pair-to-pair are maintained substantially equal distances      apart with the distances between adjacent pairs maintained substantially      constant along the length of the cable. This has the effect of minimizing      cross-talk between pairs and permitting closeness between some of the      pairs such as to detract from this minimized cross-talk capability. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  What is claimed is: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
