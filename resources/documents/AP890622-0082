(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A failed crane badly damaged a $70million satellite that was to have beamed TV signals to India, saysMcDonnell Douglas Corp.   The accident Monday, in which a heavy hook fell on the satelliteand destroyed an essential antenna, delayed McDonnell Douglas' plansto be the first American aerospace company to put a commercialpayload into orbit.   ``It looks like what happened is the cable simply snapped. It wasnot lifting anything at the time, and there is no indication ofoperator error,'' McDonnell Douglas spokeswoman Sheila Carter saidWednesday.   The crane had been used to lift the satellite 116 feet to the topof a Delta 2 rocket at a launch pad McDonnell Douglas leases fromthe Air Force.   Officials were still figuring the damage to the INSAT-1Dsatellite, designed to transmit voice and data, weather pictures andTV broadcasts to 700 million people on the Indian subcontinent.   The launch, scheduled for June 29, has been postponed until thesatellite is repaired or replaced by its manufacturer, FordAerospace.</TEXT></DOC>
