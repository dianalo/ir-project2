Bush's legal counsel, Boyden Gray, said he expects motions toquash North's subpoenas will be filed soon, with legal briefsstressing the separation-of-powers issue and the precedent that noU.S. president has ever been required to take the stand in court.   ``I think that's going to happen,'' he said when asked if theWhite House would fight the subpoenas that were delivered to theJustice Department on Friday.   He said the issues of executive privilege and protection ofclassified materials would be part of the arguments if the decisionfor a motion to quash is made. Much of the information in the caseinvolves national security matters, and the government's desire toprotect that is seen as a plus for North's case.   In addition, government attorneys, who have been preparing forthe likelihood of the subpoenas for several months, would alsocontend that testimony from Reagan and Bush is not relevant toNorth's defense, according to sources who spoke on the condition ofanonymity.   In Palm Springs, Calif., where Reagan was spending New Year'seve, Deputy White House Press Secretary Roman Popadiuk would sayonly that ``the subpoena is currently under review.'' He said he didnot know whether attorneys were conferring on the subject over theholiday weekend.   Popadiuk said Reagan, staying at the desert home of publishingmagnate Walter Annenberg, was told by his chief of staff, Kenneth N.Duberstein, on Friday that the subpoena had been served. He saidReagan had been told in advance that it was coming and therefore wasnot surprised.   The Washington Post quoted a White House official as saying,under the condition of anonymity, that Reagan viewed the subpoena asan attempt to prod him into pardoning North before he leaves officeJan. 20.   Popadiuk, asked about this, said, ``I will not speculate on Mr.North's counsel's motives.''   One North attorney Saturday told CBS News that other prominentfigures in the Iran-Contra affair also would be subpoenaed totestify.   Asked if he would name former national security advisers JohnPoindexter and Robert McFarland as among those likely to be called,the unidentified lawyer said, ``No, I can not, but they'd be theobvious ones that are involved in this matter.''   During the congressional Iran-Contra hearings, North and hissuperior, Poindexter, said they had no direct orders from Reagan orBush, then vice president, to carry out the secret Contra aid plan.   However, one White House official close to the case acknowledged,``It would be very useful for North to have Ronald Reagan'stestimony ... to say that he wanted the Contras supported.''   Constitutional expert Laurence Tribe of Harvard University saidthat in calling Reagan, North's challenge would be ``to show he wascarrying out specific orders of the president'' in his secret Contrasupply operation.   North's trial is to begin Jan. 31 on charges stemming from theU.S. arms sales to Iran and diversion of proceeds to the Contrarebels in Nicaragua.   He is charged with conspiring with Poindexter and arms dealers toillegally divert more than $12 million in arms-sales profits to theContras.   White House legal counsel A.B. Culvahouse Jr. declined comment onthe matter Saturday.   Reagan remained out of reporters' range as he vacationed inCalifornia where he traditionally spends New Year's Eve partying atthe Rancho Mirage estate of publisher Walter Annenberg, his longtimefriend.   Bush also was in seclusion, spending a long holiday weekend withhis wife, Barbara, at the presidential retreat of Camp David, Md.   Spokesmen for the two declined comment on the personal reactionsof Bush and Reagan to the subpoenas.   Bush press secretary Sheila Tate said attorneys were ``looking atsome very serious legal and constitutional issues,'' and there wouldbe no comment. The White House said Friday it would be premature torespond.   Written questions and answers, however, apparently would not be aproblem for Reagan and Bush. The White House statement saidhistorical precedent would point in that direction rather than courtappearances.   Tribe contended that Bush, who will be president by the time thetrial starts, would have a better chance than Reagan to fight offthe subpoena.   Bush's argument could be ``fairly plausible,'' on two fronts,Tribe said in a telephone interview from Denver.   First, Reagan was North's boss, while Bush has said he was ``outof the loop'' on most of the matters in question.   Second, as a sitting president, Bush might invoke an executiveprivilege stating that involvement in the trial would interfere withhis national duties.   Regarding Bush, Tribe said, North ``would have to make a verystrong showing which I think is very unlikely.   ``Almost anything he would have to prove through Bush could beshown through pre-existing documents or written answers. And second,any alleged need to cross-examine the president would necessarily bequite speculative in light of the president-elect's own assertionthat he was out of the loop.''   Reagan, on the other hand, will no longer be president when thetrial begins, and thus would have a harder time making the executiveprivilege argument.   ``I think there's a very good chance he'll have to testify,''Tribe said.   A White House official told The Washington Post that Reaganviewed the subpoena as an attempt to prod him into pardoning North.Reagan has said, however, that justice should be allowed to take itscourse and the case should be decided at trial.   One attorney close to the case said the ``institution of thepresidency'' and the reticence to set a precedent of having apresident testify are central to arguments against the subpoenas.   The case could pose a nettlesome issue for Bush early in hispresidency, reviving questions that dogged him through much of hispresidential campaign.   The congressional Iran-Contra investigating committees concludedlast year that there was no evidence Bush knew of the diversion plan.   But questions have continued to crop up on how Bush could nothave known about North's secret operation to supply the Contrasduring the congressional ban on aid when his national securityadviser, Donald Gregg, was informed on the matter.   The Iran-Contra committees concluded Gregg was told of North'soperation in August 1986, but he testified he did not consider thematter worthy of Bush's attention, even after a supply plane pilotedby Americans was shot down by the Nicaraguans and the U.S.government disavowed any connection with it.   In addition, Bush met with former CIA operative Felix Rodriguez,a Gregg associate and an operative of North's in the Contraoperation, according to committee testimony. But they said theydiscussed Rodriguez' activities in El Salvador, not the Contras.</TEXT></DOC>
