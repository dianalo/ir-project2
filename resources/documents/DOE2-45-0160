The heating was carried out inthe ion-cyclotron-resonance frequency region. Experiments were carriedout with a hydrogen plasma with a power injection of 200 kW, H{sub 0}= 4.8 kOe, n-bar/sub e/ = 7.5x10{sup 12} cm{sup -3}, and T/sub i/{similar_to}00eV. The electron temperature T/sub e/ varied from 100 to 300 eV overthe course of the pulse, which was 3 ms long. Spectroscopic studies ofthe spatial distributions of the intensity of the emission in CrI andTiI lines showed that the source of the metal impurities in this experientwas the rf antenna. A study of the velocity distribution of chromiumatoms led to the identification of the primary mechanism for the erosionof the antenna surface. These velocity distributions corresponded toa velocity (2.5--3)x10{sup 6} cm/s at the maximum of the distributionfunction. This figure is well above the velocity of sputtered atoms ({similar_to}x10{sup5} cm/s) and agrees with the typical velocities of the particles duringarcing. The densities of chromium and iron atoms near the antenna weremeasured. The flux of these atoms into the plasma was estimated, withallowance for the attenuation in the ergodic magnetic field around theconfinement volume. The relative density of metal impurities in the plasmaturns out to be 1% if it is assumed that all the metal atoms from theantenna which pass through the confinement ergodic layer are ionizedand accumulate in the volume.</TEXT></DOC>
