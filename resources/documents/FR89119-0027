Justen, 813-893-3722.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>The shrimp fishery is managed underthe FMP and its implementing regulations at 50 CFR Part 658, as providedby the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act).Under the FMP, the Director, Southeast Region, NMFS (Regional Director),may modify by no more than 10 percent the geographical scope of the Tortugasshrimp sanctuary specified at andSection;658.22, after (1) consultation withthe gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council (Council), (2) considerationof specified criteria, and (3) determination that benefits may be increasedor adverse impacts decreased by the modification.The primary purpose of establishing the sanctuary was to protect smallshrimp and allow them to attain a larger, more valuable size prior to harvest.The FMP stipulates that, prior to any modification of the sanctuary, NMFSwill monitor and assess the impacts of the closure and advise the Councilof its findings. The Council may also consider the advice of its ShrimpAdvisory Panel regarding the findings.When the sanctuary was partially opened in 1983-1984, NMFS determined thatharvestable populations of shrimp occur periodically within a small portionof the sanctuary_a fact strongly supported by public testimony. Fishermencontend that shrimp from within this portion of the sanctuary emigrateto untrawlable areas and are unavailable to the fishery. Poor recruitmentof shrimp to the Tortugas fishery has resulted in 2 consecutive years ofpoor production and economic loss to the adjacent shrimp ports. As identifiedin the FMP, poor recruitment in the unique shrimp fishery is more a functionof environmental forces that of overfishing. Opening the area of the sanctuarycontaining all sizes of shrimp is consistent with optimum yield becauseit will allow shrimpers to obtain, on a temporary basis, a more valuablecatch per unit of effort.Thus, the Regional Director, after consulting with the Council and consideringthe criteria for modifying the sanctuary, has determined that the smallportion (approximately 54 square nautical miles) of the sanctuary thatperiodically contains harvestable shrimp should be opened for 1 year. Thisarea is less than 10 percent of the total geographical scope of the sanctuaryand such modification will increase the benefits to fishermen by optimizingthe yield of shrimp. This temporary geographic modification is consistentwith Objective 1 of the FMP because it provides temporary economic reliefto the stressed fishermen while continuing to optimize the yield of shrimprecruited to the fishery.To maximize the intended economic benefits of this action, it was necessaryto make the geographic modification as soon as possible after November1, 1988. November 1 marks the onset of the 6-month period when peak landingsoccur. Accordingly, NOAA published an emergency final rule on November9, 1988 (53 FR 45270), that implemented the geographic modification effectivefrom November 4, 1988 through February 2, 1989. NOAA also invited commentson extending the effective date of the emergency Final Rule from February2, 1989 through April 4, 1989. Comments on this extension will be acceptedthrough January 31, 1989. This extension period will assure the publicof meaningful opportunity to comment on the Proposed Rule to temporarilymodify the boundary of the Tortugas Shrimp sanctuary, and on the reportingrequirement of the incidental take of any threatened or endgangered seaturtle in the opened part of the sanctuary. Extending the effective dateof the Emergency Final Rule will also maximize the intended economic benefitsof this action because it will prevent a gap between expiration of theEmergency Final Rule and the Anticipated effective date of this proposedrule.This proposed rule (1) would continue the geographic modification of theTortugas shrimp sanctuary through November 3, 1989, and (2) require a reportof the incidental take of any threatened or endangered sea turtle in theopened portion of the Tortugas shrimp sanctuary. The latter could not beimplemented in the emergency final rule because it was necessary to meetthe requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act. However, a voluntary reportof such incidental take and compliance with the sea turtle resuscitationprocedures and release techniques were identified in the emergency finalrule as means for fishermen to avoid the taking prohibition of the ESA.<ITAG tagnum="84">Endangered Species Impacts</ITAG>NOAA initiated consultation under Section 7 of the Endangered Species Actregarding the impact of this proposed rule on endangered and threatenedsea turtles. A Biological Opinion resulting from that consultation foundthat this proposed rule would not jeopardize the continued existency ofany endangered or threatened species or result in adverse modificationof the critical habitat of such species. However, implementation of thisproposed rule is likely to result in the take and mortality of sea turtles,particularly loggerhead and Kemp's ridley turtles. To mitigate and monitor the incidental take of sea turtles, NOAA proposesto establish two conditions applicable to shrimp trawling in the openedportion of the Tortugas shrimp sanctuary, as follows:  (1) If a sea turtle is taken in a shrimp trawl, sea turtle resuscitationprocedures and release techniques specified at 50 CFR 227.72(e)(1) mustbe followed.  (2) If a sea turtle is taken in a shrimp trawl, the date and the statusof each sea turtle taken must be reported to NMFS within 24 hours afterlanding.  (Reporting forms, sea turtle identification guides, and resuscitation techniquesare available (see <T2>ADDRESSES</T2>).)  By complying with these conditions, a person fishing for shrimp who incidentallytakes an endangered or threatened sea turtle in the opened portion of theTortugas shrimp sanctuary would avoid violating the Endangered SpeciesAct's general prohibitions on taking. The regulations that will requireuse of turtle excluder devices and other conservative measures in the Gulfof Mexico, scheduled to be effective May 1, 1989, will be applicable inthe opened portion of the Tortugas shrimp sanctuary at that time.<ITAG tagnum="84">Classification  </ITAG>The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, (Assistant Administrator),determined that this proposed rule is consistent with the national standardsand other provisions of the Magnuson Act and other applicable law.  The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce certified to the SmallBusiness Administration that this proposed rule, if adopted, would nothave a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entitiesbecause the geographical area affected by the rule is small and, as a result,the number of shrimp trawlers affected in the Gulf-wide fishery would notbe substantial. As a result, a regulatory flexibility analysis was notprepared.   The Council prepared a regulatory impact review (RIR) for this proposedrule and the Under Secretary for Oceans and Atmosphere, NOAA, determinedthat the rule is not major under E.O. 12291 because it would not have anannual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; would not resultin an increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; andwould not result in significant adverse effects on competition, employment,investment, productivity, innovation, or the ability of U.S.-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets. The Council prepared an environmental assessment (EA) for this proposedrule and, based on the EA, the Assistant Administrator concluded that therewill be no significant adverse impact on the human environment as a resulton this rule. Copies of the EA/RIR are available (see ADDRESSES).  This proposed rule contains a collection-of-information requirement subjectto the Paperwork Reduction Act. A request to collect this information thasbeen submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for approval.Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimatedto average 12 minutes per response, including the time for reviewing instructions,searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed,and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send commentsregarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection ofinformation, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to: MichaelE. Justen, Southeast Region, NMFS, and to the Office of Information andRegulatory Affairs, OMB (see ADDRESSES).  This proposed rule does not contain policies with federalism implicationssufficient to warrant preparation of a federalism assessment under E.O.12612.  The Council determined that this rule will be implemented in a manner thatis consistent to the maximum extent practicable with the approved coastalzone management program of Florida. This determination was submitted forreview by Florida under Section 307 of the Coastal Zone Management Act.Florida failed to comment within the satutory time period and concurrenceis therefore implied.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 658</ITAG>Fisheries, Fishing, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: January 13, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James W.
