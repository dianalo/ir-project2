But over the longer term, he added, &quot;we still think the dollar is going substantially lower.&quot;    Behind the improved short-term outlook for the dollar is Friday's report that U.S. employment rose in November while the jobless rate held steady. That led many market participants to conclude that the American economy isn't as bad as they thought. Traders also cited lessening alarm over the recent disclosures about secret U.S. arms sales to Iran and funding of Nicaraguan rebels.    The Labor Department reported Friday that the civilian unemployment rate was unchanged at 7% in November while the non-farm economy added 249,000 jobs. &quot;The unemployment figures showed the outlook for the economy is better than expected and that the forthcoming (economic) numbers could be better,&quot; said Robert H. Holzer, vice president and chief dealer at Harris Trust andamp; Savings Bank, Chicago.    Added Peter Rogers, vice president and chief foreign-exchange trader at Banco di Sicilia, New York, &quot;There's a feeling that the upcoming numbers are going to be fairly bullish on the economy.&quot;    The improved view of the economy also appears to reduce the likelihood that the U.S. Federal Reserve Board will cut its discount rate this year, as was once widely expected. Lower interest rates would make dollar-denominated investments relatively less attractive and thereby reduce demand for dollars. &quot;The dollar wouldn't be trading higher if people thought a discount-rate cut was imminent,&quot; said Richard Witten, vice president of foreign exchange at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., New York. &quot;We don't expect to see a discount-rate cut for the next few months.&quot; The discount rate is the lending fee the Fed charges to financial institutions.    The dollar should also get help this month as U.S. corporations buy the currency to repatriate year-end profits, traders said. The relatively thin, holiday-season trading will probably exaggerate the impact of these corporate purchases. &quot;The year-end trading tends to pull the dollar up,&quot; Mr. Rogers said.    In late New York trading Friday, the dollar stood at 2.0070 marks, up from 2.0003 Thursday. The dollar also climbed to 1.6770 Swiss francs from 1.6700, but it eased to 162.54 Japanese yen from 162.88. The British pound fell to $1.4218 from $1.4310.    Despite the improved short-term situation, traders remained bearish in their long-term assessment for the currency. They cited the political pressure for a weak dollar to help reduce the huge U.S. trade deficit, and a potentially uncooperative economy. &quot;We don't think the dollar is heading back to the 2.40 (mark) level. In fact, we don't think the dollar will get through the 2.05 level on this move,&quot; Mr. Witten of Goldman Sachs said.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York Friday, gold for current delivery rose $1.10 an ounce, to $389.50, in light trading. The estimated volume was two million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $391.05 an ounce in early trading Monday in Hong Kong.    ---                      CURRENCY RATES                          New York    Home Mkt.
