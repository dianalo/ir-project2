Wegter said Thursday that the community intended to ask theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade for consultations over thelatest in a series of agricultural clashes between the giant tradingpartners. The 96-nation GATT is a forum for removing barriers toworld trade.   Carla Hills, the U.S. trade representative, on Wednesday issued aruling that the community's production and processing subsidies onoilseeds and animal feed proteins were ``unjustifiable andunreasonable and (they) burden or restrict U.S. commerce.''   She delayed until the end of January taking any punitive actionsin the case.   The dispute stems from a complaint filed in December 1987 by theAmerican Soybean Association, which alleged the community subsidieshad sharply cut into American exports to Europe.   The association argued that the Common Market payments encouragedfarmers to grow oilseeds which then reduced the demand for Americanimports. The group contended U.S. soybean exports fell to $2 billionin 1986 from $3.6 billion in 1981.   The Common Market has argued that the erosion of the Europeanmarket was largely due to increases in cheaper imports from Braziland Argentina.   In May, GATT set up an impartial panel to determine whether thesubsidies amounted to unfair trade practices under internationalrules. The panel held its first meeting on June 27 and was expectedto issue its findings in early January.   Mrs. Hills' decision to rule in the case while the GATT panel wasconducting its investigating was criticized by the Common Market.   ``It is in our view contradictory,'' said Wegter.   He reiterated the Common Market's contention that the subsidyprogram did not constitute an unfair trade practice.   ``Our production is kept under strict control,'' he said. ``Theprices have gone down, and it is in no way affecting imports by theAmericans.''   The community provides costly subsidies to its farmers throughguaranteed prices for many of their crops. It also gives exportershelp so more expensive European farm products can compete with lowerprices on the world market.   The United States complains the export subsidies have helped thecommunity increase its share of the world market.</TEXT></DOC>
