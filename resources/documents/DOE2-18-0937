<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-18-0937 </DOCNO><TEXT>Methods and software for effective organization of mass processing ofdata on multiuser ES computer are proposed.Magnetic tape accumulators,the main advantge of which consists in high capacity and acceptable exchangerate, are used for mass data processig, which includes three main stages:selection of initil data sets from the file, processing itself and transmissionof resulting data sets to the file. Decentralized organization of associatedassignments appears to be a characteristic feature of mass data processingstructure. Dynamic adjustment is performed using directive language,software is written in FORTRAN and ASSEMBLER languages. Organizationof mass data processing from BIS-2 spectrometer is considered. Applicationof the means proposed increases the rate of mass data processing usinga multiuser computer and increases the system efficiency 5-6 times ascompared to traditional approaches. 7 refs.; 1 fig.</TEXT></DOC>
