The unrest fuels internal criticism that the Soviet leader is losing hold of the empire, U.S. officials say. Kremlin conservatives are said to fear that East Europeans and even Soviets in the Baltic States feel encouraged to test new Soviet tolerance. They worry that the withdrawal from Afghanistan suggests a weakened Soviet resolve.    The Soviets' No. 2 man, Yigor Ligachev, makes his first public attack on Gorbachev's attempt to shift the country to &quot;peaceful coexistence.&quot; Meanwhile, the strikes in Poland also pose problems for Gorbachev's efforts to woo Western Europe. A brutal crackdown could set back efforts to improve relations with Germany, which has gained from new conventional arms initiatives.    Though Gorbachev's policies are under fire, U.S. officials believe he remains firmly in control.    CRASH JITTERS revive about financial markets, but regulators are calm.    Interest rates are rising again, as they were last October when the stock market collapsed. A top government official argues privately that a rush of congressional activity next month could add to market worries. Kenneth Cone, a Chicago Mercantile Exchange official, warns that the advent of Japanese stock-index futures trading this fall may cause global market problems.    But Treasury Undersecretary George Gould says worries about a new crash are overblown. The speculative &quot;hot air&quot; in last year's stock market is gone, he argues. Nevertheless, the Fed takes the concerns seriously enough that it prepares contingency plans for a market crash: &quot;We've got a bag of tricks for anything,&quot; says one Fed policy maker.    PESSIMISM PERVADES efforts of the bipartisan panel on deficit reduction.    The commission keeps a low profile, talking to budget experts behind closed doors. But even deal maker Robert Strauss, the co-chairman, may find consensus elusive. GOP appointees Caspar Weinberger and Donald Rumsfeld show no willingness to compromise. Farm Bureau chief Dean Kleckner has &quot;less concern&quot; about deficits now. Says GOP Rep. Frenzel: &quot;The odds are probably against success.&quot;    Dukakis says creating the panel was a good idea; he promises to consider its advice. Bush softens his attacks on the commission but vows to ignore expected calls for tax increases. The GOP platform swipes at the panel, declaring: &quot;Decisions of our government should not be left to a body of unelected officials.&quot;    But if Bush must deal with a Democratic Congress on deficits, &quot;the commission will look pretty attractive to him,&quot; says panel consultant Carol Cox.    GETTING ORGANIZED: Some Democrats worry that Bush is better organized than Dukakis in several key states. A top concern is California, where the GOP has lots of savvy strategists and where the Dukakis campaign is considered second rate. Dukakis aides counter that, because of Bentsen, they have the advantage in Texas.    SECRET WEAPON: While gradually making Quayle more available to the press, Bush advisers also plan to offer the senator's wife, Marilyn, for interviews. They figure she evokes sympathy. Behind the scenes, Mrs. Quayle is an assertive adviser, and some GOP strategists say she is the real brains of the family.    FOND FAREWELL: Bush isn't the only prominent Republican who got a boost in popularity from this month's GOP convention. In the new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, conducted after Reagan's sentimental televised farewell to the party, 57% of Americans approved of his handling of the presidency, up from 51% just before the convention.    MANILA'S DEMANDS for more than a sixfold increase in U.S. payments to use Philippines bases raise worries of an impasse. The Philippines' foreign minister will visit Washington next month to press for $1.2 billion a year over the next two fiscal years. The top U.S. offer is $450 million.    ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES gain more attention in the presidential race.    Bush's polls show environmental concerns rising above other &quot;second tier&quot; issues, one GOP adviser says. Bush responds by trying to distance himself from Reagan on some issues. He promises to reduce acid rain, a pledge Reaganites have avoided. His call to stop ocean dumping contradicts administration policy. Bush backers taunt Dukakis by citing the dumping of raw sewage into Boston Harbor.    Dukakis contrasts his views on the environment with Bush's. Unlike Bush, he opposes further nuclear reactor construction and drilling in an Alaska wildlife refuge. The League of Conservation Voters gives Dukakis high marks but faults him for a &quot;fear of antagonizing business&quot; in his second term as Massachusetts governor.    Dukakis's administration angered environmentalists by letting a shopping-center developer pave over a wetland.    MINOR MEMOS: The satirical troupe Gross National Product begins bus &quot;scandal tours&quot; of Washington, including Gary Hart's former town house, Watergate and the Pentagon. . . . Reagan claims that Dukakis's plans for the Navy are so bad that by the time he is finished &quot;Michael will have to row the boat ashore.&quot; . . . Huh? The U.S. Chamber of Commerce says the latest increase in the U.S. trade deficit &quot;is not as bad as it seems and is more than meets the eye.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
