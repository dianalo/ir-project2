<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-67-0059 </DOCNO><TEXT>The Alkali Metal Thermoelectric Converter, AMTEC, is an electrochemicalconcentration cell in which a sodium activity gradient exists acrossa sodium beta alumina solid electrolyte, BASE, between a high temperature,T/sub 2/ = 900 to 1300 K, liquid sodium reservoir and a porous electrodefrom which sodium can evaporate to a cooler condenser, T/sub 1/ = 400to 600 K. The sodium activity at the porous electrode is controlled byfactors including its temperature, the temperature of the condenser,the current density, the electrode's morphology, and the nature of theprocesses responsible for sodium transport through the electrode. Whilegas phase molecular diffusion (Knudsen flow) is typically the dominanttransport process in clean, porous metal film electrodes, the best AMTECelectrodes (fresh molybdenum electrodes containing sodium molybdate orliquid metal electrodes) exhibit sodium transport enhanced by the presenceof a condensed phase in which sodium is mobile, such as a molten saltor liquid alloy. The authors have previously reported high initial powerlevels from tungsten-noble metal AMTEC electrodes. In this paper, theyreport high power, co-sputtered tungsten-platinum AMTEC electrodes whichprovide stable power densities of 0.5 watt/cm/sup 2/ over 90 hour testperiods, and may operate by surface diffusion of sodium on platinum.</TEXT></DOC>
