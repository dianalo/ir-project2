Clark, NTIS deputydirector.andP;  NTIS is the repository for several thousand federal and foreignresearch reports, as well as numerous government software products.andM;&quot;NTIS has not been as much involved in investing into systems improvements aswe probably should have been,&quot; Clark said.andM;But for the last two years NTIS has struggled to maintain current programs,while Congress and the administration fought over whether to contract out theentire NTIS operation.andM;Privatizing government programs was a major, if unsuccessful, initiative ofthe Reagan administration, and President Bush has shown signs of continuingthe effort.andM;Last year, Congress amended Commerce's appropriation legislation, making itimpossible to privatize NTIS without congressional consent.andM;&quot;The outcome of all of that is that by and large privatization is behind us,&quot;Clark said.andP;  &quot;In essence, the big privatization issues have been settled.&quot;andM;Now NTIS officials are thinking about the future, about new systems and newservices.andM;Both Congress and the administration have shown &quot;a real commitment&quot; to themodernization effort, Clark said.andP;  A clause in the president's budgetannounced the intended upgrade.andM;Money for the program will be an issue, Clark said.andP;  NTIS receives noappropriated funding, but covers costs through revenue from product sales.andO;&quot;If a business wants to make an investment in their company, they go to thebank.andP;  Our version of going to the bank is going to the Hill,&quot; Clark said.andO;&quot;It's conceivable that we could get a loan on the monies flowing through herenow.&quot;andM;If NTIS had to raise the capital for the upgrade from revenues, however, theagency might have to raise NTIS product prices, he said.andM;But money questions are still a bit premature.andP;  The agency does not plan tohave a modernization proposal completed before this summer, Clark said.andO;Officials will decide later in the year how much money will be needed forupgrades, how it will be spent and where it will come from, he said.andM;The agency has created a new advisory committee to oversee the project andkeep it focused, Clark said.andP;  At this point, NTIS modernization is really alot of &quot;light bulbs shining over people's heads&quot; and nothing has beenwritten, he said.andM;&quot;It's a sort of NTIS 2000.andP;  What will NTIS look like in the year 2000?&quot;andO;Clark said.andP;  &quot;We certainly don't intend to come in with a big system thingand solve all our problems.&quot;andM;Any proposal will include improvements to the systems NTIS uses to gather,preare, archive and disseminate its information products, he said.andP;  This alsomeans increased training and ergonomic concerns will be a part of the finalpackage.andM;Now, NTIS purchases time on Commerce's mainframes, two IBM 3081s and an  IBM4341.andP;  Most of NTIS's applications, running under the MVS operating system,are on the 3081s, which are located at the NTIS offices in Springfield, Va.,andO;said James C. McNeill, director of the NTIS Office of Computer andCommunications Services.andP;  An upgrade to MVS XA is expected shortly, he said.andM;About 150 dumb terminals, used for searches and sales processing, are linkedto the mainframes.andM;For administrative in-house work, the agency also has a mix of IBM orIBM-compatible personal computers and Apple Macintoshes numbering roughly100, McNeill said.andM;&quot;If there is one overriding principle that we will adhere to as we move downthe pike it is: What will improve the service to our customers?&quot;andP;  Clark said.andO;Going to NTIS users for their perspectives will play a major role in theproposal's outcome, he said.andM;NTIS officials also have undertaken some projects to prepare the agency forchange, Clark said.andP;  Basically, during the last year, NTIS has had fourautomation initiatives.andP;  The agency, with 350 employees, steadily has beenincreasing the number of terminals and microcomputers, Clark said.andP;  Trainingfor the microcomputers has been intensified.andP;  NTIS has been replacing olderdecks and chairs with ergonomic furniture.andP;  A computerized ordering systemhas been put at the front-end of the NTIS sales process.andM;&quot;We've definitely started down the path to change,&quot; Clark said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
