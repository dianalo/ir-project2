Some government officials feared that the FDIC would allowthe thrifts to pull out and that such a decision could leadto an exodus from the home loan banks and hurt the system'sability to help pay for the bailout.</LP><TEXT>   The FDIC action came on a request from a small Wisconsinthrift, Wauwatosa Savings andamp; Loan Association, which asked theFDIC if it could maintain its federal deposit insurance if itpulled out of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago.   The FDIC, in a closed board meeting yesterday, decided totell Wauwatosa Savings that if the thrift left the system,the FDIC could &quot;make no assurances&quot; that the thrift couldmaintain its insurance, agency officials said.   However, the FDIC's board voted to postpone a finaldecision for 18 months to consider the issue in conjunctionwith other regulators, including the Office of ThriftSupervision. FDIC officials said the OTS intends to propose aregulation that state-chartered thrifts must belong to theFederal Home Loan Bank System.   Last year's Sandamp;L bailout law made it clear that federallychartered thrifts must maintain their membership but left thestatus of state-chartered thrifts unclear. The home loanbanks are required to contribute as much as $300 million ayear to the bailout, and some thrifts have complained thatthose and other costs have made membership unattractive.   Members must own stock in the home loan banks and receivedividends on that stock. In addition, all banks and thriftsmust pay premiums for deposit insurance coverage.   But Treasury Department officials warned the FDIC that ifthe agency let the thrifts go, it could become difficult forthe home loan banks to meet their required contribution tothe bailout. Some important members of Congress, such asHouse Banking Committee Chairman Henry Gonzalez (D., Texas),also were concerned that a flight of thrifts from the systemwould cripple the affordable-housing programs the home loanbanks must pay for under the bailout law.   Officials of Wauwatosa Savings couldn't be reached forcomment last night.</TEXT></DOC>
