Gov. Pete Wilson is nowpredicting that the California state budget will be $8 billion under waterthis year, and he's an optimist. Since the state is prohibited from runningdeficits, the only options are painful ones.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  WILSON AND WELFARECUTTING WELFARE MAY BE NECESSARY FOR THESTATE, BUT IT'S NOT A WORK INCENTIVE  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Editorials  </MEMO><TEXT>     One of the cuts Wilson has proposed is a $225 million reduction in Aid toFamilies with Dependent Children, the state's primary welfare program. For asingle parent with two children, this would amount to a reduction of $61 permonth in welfare benefits, from $694 to $633.;    Although we believe highertaxes should also play a major role in closing the budget gap, every programmust take a share of cuts. As the governor's office points out, increasedfederal food stamp payments would make up for about one-third of thereduction. Even with lower AFDC payments, California welfare payments wouldstill be the third highest of any state.;    But beyond the claims of hardnecessity, Wilson has argued that cutting welfare support should be viewed asa beneficial because it will encourage work efforts.;    In a recent radioaddress, the governor said: &quot;In California, the grant to welfare recipients isso high that it actually serves as a temptation to stay on welfare . . . Wemust shift the emphasis from supporting dependence to promoting independence.We must place greater emphasis on work incentives. . . .&quot;;    It's true thatthe welfare system creates serious disincentives to work, an issue exploredfurther in a column by economist Timothy Taylor on the Commentary Page. ButWilson's budget cuts are not an appropriate answer.;    After all, the logicthat lower welfare payments will cause people to work harder has no limit. Whynot eliminate welfare, and thus provide the highest possible incentives towork?;    The reason, of course, is that society has made a humane commitmentto provide minimum support to those who are going through hard times. Mostpeople enter the welfare system because of changes largely beyond theircontrol: breakup of a marriage, a breadwinner losing a job, illness in thefamily.;    A 1989 study done for the Legislature found that about two-thirdsof AFDC recipients are off welfare in less than a year; two-fifths are offwithin six months.;    Most current recipients of AFDC are low-skilled singleparents with children, who face rising unemployment rates in the currentrecession, as well as rising child-care costs. Cutting their monthly benefitsby $61 isn't likely to provoke a surge of independence.;    Cuts in Aid toFamilies with Dependent Children will not only affect adults, but will alsoaffect the children, and will reduce payments to some families below themodest &quot;need&quot; level currently set by the state.;    Reduced welfare paymentsmay be a grit-your-teeth-and-bear-it necessity in California's current fiscalcrisis, but they are not to be welcomed for any reason.  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910318  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  6B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  498  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday March 18, 199100078088,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
