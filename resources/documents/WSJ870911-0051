Market participants have been expecting a wide U.S. trade deficit for July ever since a $15.71 billion gap for June was reported four weeks ago. Because of the unexpected size of the June deficit, the dollar has since fallen by 5% or more against most other major currencies.    Traders generally don't expect the dollar to react as wildly to today's report as it did when the June figures were released Aug. 14. At that time, the dollar was in an extended rally and traders were unprepared for the bad news.    Although estimates for the July deficit vary widely, economists generally expect a trade gap of $16 billion or more. Such a figure is believed to be largely factored into exchange rates already, traders said, and probably wouldn't prompt a heavy sell-off of the U.S. currency.    Moreover, traders say major central banks including the U.S. Federal Reserve will be ready to intervene to support the dollar and avert a sharp drop in its value.    &quot;This time, the central banks are more prepared,&quot; Garrett R. Glass, vice president, foreign exchange, at First National Bank of Chicago, said.    Estimates for the July deficit range from $12 billion to $20 billion. But a figure at the low end of the spectrum still wouldn't necessarily be considered good for the U.S. currency or economy.    As long as the U.S. continues to post wide trade deficits, the dollar will continue to head lower, traders said. Masakazu Miyamori, senior vice president and chief trader in New York for Japan's Sanwa Bank Ltd., said the dollar probably will fall a further 15% against the Japanese yen because of the trade and federal budget deficits before it bottoms out next year.    But with market participants apparently prepared for the worst in the July trade report, some dealers said, the dollar has a good chance of moving up today.    Joseph F. Teel, a trader at Commercial Bank of Kuwait in New York, said the dollar could have a &quot;knee-jerk reaction upward&quot; on a U.S. deficit of $14 billion or less because &quot;it would be better than what people were expecting.&quot;    Yesterday's news in Tokyo that Japan's trade surplus narrowed in August caused the dollar to rise in Asian trading to its intraday highs of 142.95 yen and 1.8087 West German marks. Japan's Finance Ministry said that country's trade surplus shrank to $5.15 billion last month from $7.48 billion a year earlier.    The news had little impact on subsequent trading, however.    &quot;That's August data,&quot; First Chicago's Mr. Glass said, and the market's immediate concern is with the U.S. trade performance in July.    In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar stood at 142.41 yen, compared with 142.03 late Wednesday. The dollar also firmed to 1.8046 marks from 1.8023.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose $6.20 an ounce to $463.10 in moderate trading. Estimated volume was 3.7 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $462.25 an ounce in early trading today in Hong Kong.    ---                  LATE NEW YORK TRADING                 Thursday, Sept. 10, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
