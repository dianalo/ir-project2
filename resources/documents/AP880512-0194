DALE NELSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A panel of federal officials Thursdayrecommended legislative and other changes to encourage adoption,which it said was ``too often forgotten, ignored or misunderstood''as an alternative to abortion.   The Interagency Task Force on Adoption also said ``the pool ofadoptive parents should expand, and martial status, age or physicaldisabilities should not preclude individuals from consideration asprospective parents.''   However, it curtly dismissed the demands of some gay rightsorganizations for expanded rights for gay men and lesbians to adoptchildren, saying only, ``The task force does not support adoptionby homosexuals.''   The panel said it was preferable that a child be placed in afamily of his or her own racial background, but adoption acrossracial lines ``should be permissible to provide a child with aloving, permanent home.''   The report of the 13-member task force, appointed by PresidentReagan last August, was made public after the president, himself anadoptive parent, presented it to representatives of privateagencies in an Oval Office meeting.   The task force said about 40 percent of the 1 million Americanteen-agers who become pregnant each year have abortions. Of theteenagers who have their babies, it said, at least 90 percent endup parenting them.   ``A prevailing view appears to be that if a woman does not getan abortion, she must want to have a baby and take care of himherself,'' the panel said. ``The option which gives life to a baby,while offering hope to the biological parents and joy to adoptiveparents, is too often forgotten, ignored or misunderstood.''   The task force recommended that states consider a law adopted inCalifornia that reimburses licensed, non-profit maternity homes forthe costs of materinty home care and services necessary for a womanunder 21 to carry her baby to full term.   It also recommended that states consider legislation, which itsaid at least 20 have already adopted, exempting directors andofficers on non-profit orgqanizations from liability suits unlesswillful or wanton misconduct is involved. It said such legislationis needed because adoption agencies have been hit hard by risingliability insurance costs.   The task force recommended support for pending federallegislation concering social security benefits for adopted childrenand health insurance coverage for disabled adopted children.   ``Children often remain in foster care programs for too long aperiod of time before a plan for adoption is developed,'' the panelsaid. It recommended ``procedures for more timely termination ofparental rights, establishment of foster care review boards,,accountability and supervision of agency caseworkers'' and relatedsteps.   The chairman of the task force was Mary Sheila Gall, counselorto the director of the Office of Personnel Management and thesingle adoptive parent of two children.   Other members included representatives from the White House,Justice Department, Treasury Deparrtment, Department of Health andHuman Services, Department of Education, Department of Defense,Department of Agriculture, Department of Labor and CommodityFutures Trading Commission.</TEXT></DOC>
