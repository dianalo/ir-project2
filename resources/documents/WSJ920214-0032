The experiment, which received federal approval this week,is a collaboration between scientists from a unit of ImmunexCorp. and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center inSeattle.</LP><TEXT>   Scientists envision treating between five and 15 AIDSpatients who also are suffering from an AIDS-linkedmalignancy, B-cell lymphoma. They will be patients slated toundergo a bone-marrow transplant for the treatment of theircancer, and shortly after that procedure doctors plan toinsert special genetically altered cells to treat the virus.   A test of the new treatment got a green light by theNational Institutes of Health Recombinant DNA AdvisoryCommittee, after gaining approval of the U.S. Food and DrugAdministration in January.   The aim of the experiment is to flood the body of thesepatients with huge numbers of killer T-cells, which arespecifically targeted immune cells that attack and killAIDS-infected cells. In case the experiment should go awry orprovoke toxic side effects, the killer cells will be equippedwith a gene that acts as a so-called suicide switch, enablingdoctors to turn off the experiment simply by giving thepatients an antibiotic.   The suicide gene is to be spliced into the killer cellsusing classical genetic engineering techniques. Suchtechniques employ a mouse-tumor virus as a tool to insert agene rendering the cells sensitive to the antibioticganciclovir. Once inserted, this gene acts as a switchscientists can use to inactivate the killer cells, and turnoff the experiment at will, with a dose of ganciclovir.   Treating immune-suppressed patients with one billionvirus-fighting cells is a delicate procedure, with some riskthe immune reaction might become &quot;over-exuberant,&quot; explainedteam leader Philip A. Greenberg of the Hutchinson Center.   &quot;We're trying to rebuild an enormous immune response inthese patients,&quot; said Dr. Greenberg in an interview. &quot;Butthere's the potential that the immune response might be toostrong, and might cause inflammation to the brain and lung.The suicide switch really broadens the safety margin of theexperiment.&quot;   So far, American scientists have used gene therapy inseveral separate tests to treat cancer patients and childrenwith a hereditary immune weakness known as ADA deficiency.Those experiments have been led by Drs. Steven A. Rosenbergand W. French Anderson at the National Institutes of Health.A third gene therapy treatment for patients with hereditaryhigh cholesterol has been approved by NIH to take place atthe University of Michigan.   One gene therapy pioneer, Dr. Anderson of NIH, called theSeattle experiment &quot;very exciting . . . a very importantprotocol.&quot;   In a related move, Immunex announced plans to spin off itsTargeted Genetics Corp. unit to pursue gene therapy as anindependent company. Following a planned private placement ofstock, the biotech firm said it will retain a 40% stake inthe new company.</TEXT></DOC>
