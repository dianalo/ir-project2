Actually, the well-observed regions of galaxies show minimalvariation of UPSILON. It is argued that even the most extended HI rotationcurves could be understood in terms of constant UPSILON if estimatesof the brightness of the night sky were subject to systematic errorsin the region of 4-8%.</TEXT></DOC>
