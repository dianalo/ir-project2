The September silver futures contract price declined 14 cents to $6.52 an ounce after trading as low as $6.49, its lowest level since the first week of May. December gold closed at $438.70 an ounce, near its low of the day and down $2.70 from Friday's close. And platinum for October delivery dropped as low as $529.50 an ounce before partially recovering to settle at $532.60, down $9.60 for the day.    &quot;Weakness in oil . . . also was a depressant in precious metals, as was the continued lack of demand for physical gold and silver,&quot; said William O'Neill, research director for Elders Futures Inc., New York. He observed that Iran and Iraq haven't come to any agreement to curb production of crude oil.    Richard Hirsch, vice president and metals broker at Gerald Commodities Inc., in New York, said that &quot;a whole slew of bearish factors came together in precious metals, and a relatively thin market&quot; -- which he said partly reflected the fact that London markets were closed for the August bank holiday -- accentuated the downside of the market.    Platinum traders apparently ignored reports of unrest in South Africa, Elders' Mr. O'Neill said. In the past, reports of such unrest often has stirred concern over platinum supplies and contributed to price increases.    Bernard Savaiko, senior precious metals analyst for PaineWebber Inc., New York, said that the strength of the dollar depressed platinum from the beginning of trading but that toward the end of the session silver became the downside leader.    Stocks of silver in warehouses of New York's Commodity Exchange, which have been rising steadily, reached a record of almost 175 million ounces prior to the beginning of yesterday's trading -- an overnight gain of 230,000 ounces, Mr. Savaiko noted.    Tomorrow will be the first day on which notices to deliver silver against the September contract will be issued. &quot;With the approach of first-notice day, the large stocks of silver could portend heavy deliveries against the September contract, which prompted selling in futures,&quot; Mr. Savaiko said. He added that a lack of investment demand for silver is causing dealers to use the futures market as a means to dispose of excess inventories of bullion.    Offering a longer-term view, Mr. Savaiko said that without investor demand, new mine output is likely to pressure prices. Nor will silver's status as an industrial metal necessarily save it from a tumble in the weeks ahead, Mr. Savaiko said. &quot;There are traders who believe the economy is showing signs of a slowdown, which would mean less demand for silver,&quot; according to Mr. Savaiko.    In other commodity markets yesterday:   COPPER: Futures prices declined on profit-taking, following recent advances. The December futures contract price fell 0.55 cent to $1.0020 a pound. The closing of London markets for a holiday also contributed to the easier tone. Since Aug. 9, when it was at 87.50 cents, the December contract had risen more than 13 cents a pound to a life-of-contract high of $1.0090 last Friday. The American Bureau of Metal Statistics released figures showing that, while U.S. inventories of copper remain relatively tight, there has been no dramatic rise in output. It also reported that copper inventories in U.S. refiners' hands at the end of July amounted to 21,000 tons, down from 25,300 tons in June and sharply below the 72,000 tons in July 1987.    COFFEE: Futures prices eased on concern over continued friction that could endanger the International Coffee Agreement. December-delivery coffee declined 1.24 cents to $1.2250 a pound. According to one analyst, nervousness was generated by statements by the U.S. and other major consuming nations that indicate growing dissatisfaction with the agreement. Reuter quoted Jon Rosenbaum, assistant U.S. trade representative, as saying producing nations were &quot;gutless&quot; and &quot;afraid to pin the tail on the donkey,&quot; that is, unwilling to assess penalties on exporting nations that have sold coffee to non-member ICO nations at prices lower than ICO members pay. The report also said the Reagan administration has decided to participate in talks on the future of the global export quota system, but there is no guarantee Washington will sign what emerges from the negotiations.    GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Corn and soybean futures mostly fell in response to slack export demand and anticipation of large deliveries against the maturing September contracts. &quot;Traders are looking for big deliveries,&quot; said Jerry Gidel, an analyst with G. H. Miller andamp; Co., a Chicago-based unit of LIT America, London. Traders are expected Wednesday to give notice of intentions to deliver more than 10 million bushels each of corn and soybeans against September contracts. An announcement by Richard J. Dennis, one of the most successful commodity speculators of the past two decades, that he was retiring from the markets, fueled some selling. Weekend rains in many farming regions also contributed to the declines. After the futures markets closed yesterday, the Agriculture Department said crop conditions in important Midwestern soybean-producing states had improved in the past week. In Iowa, for instance, 51% of the soybean crop was in fair condition as of last Friday, compared with 38% a week earlier. In Illinois, 65% of the soybeans were in fair condition, up from 49% a week earlier. </TEXT></DOC>
