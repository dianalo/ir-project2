Taking into account existingdetail studies assessing the technical potential, a quantitative evaluationtries to get hold of the upper economic limits and the possible contributionswithin them for 1990 and 2000. Against what was assumed in the frameof an earlier study, there has been a drastic slump in fossil energyprices only recently. As a matter of fact, their medium-term rises areexpected to be negligible. Low fossil energy prices, however, weakenthe economic chances of renewable energy sources in most cases. At present,the actual realization of the potential assumed for the unfavourablespell through 2000 would therefore be considered a valuable success.(UA)</TEXT></DOC>
