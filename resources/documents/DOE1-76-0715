Creeptests have been carried out over a wide range of stresses that producedrupture times varying from a few days to -- 10 yr. Log-log plots of stressversus rupture life were linear at 823 K, while a rapid decrease in stressto rupture was observed at longer lives at 923 K. A power law relationshipindicative of dislocation creep was found between steady-state creeprate and applied stress. The variation of rupture ductility with rupturelife at 823 K exhibited a minimum. At other temperatures, a peak in ductilitywas observed. Pronounced heat-to-heat variations have been observed inthe creep-rupture properties at all the test conditions. The variationshave been attributed to differences in the chemical composition and inthe grain size of the material. A comparison of the results with theAmerican Society of Mechanical Engineers design criteria for time-dependentdeformation is also presented.</TEXT></DOC>
