This vote is not a votefor unilateral nuclear disarmament by the West, nor is it a vote againstthe Alliance; it is not a vote against NATO's dual-track decision inits original form of 1979, nor is it a vote against balanced arms controlnegotiations with the Soviet Union. In point of fact, it is a vote againstthe stationing of these weapons systems in the densely populated territoryof Western Europe; it is a vote against the dreaded danger that it mightbecome possible to wage limited nuclear wars in Europe; it is a voteagainst a further lowering of the nuclear threshold; and it is a voteagainst a continuation of the nuclear arms race. Finally, it is a votefor a less risky and more promising framework of negotiations and fora reform of the Alliance's strategy.</TEXT></DOC>
