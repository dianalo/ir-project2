So whenhe heard on the radio that they was havin' an eliction up inNew Hampshire he comes in and tries to milk me forinformation, and, moind you, he doesn't think I know whathe's up to.   &quot;That Rheinholt Rubin fella,&quot; he says, &quot;the prisidint, themovie star, is he a Jarmin? The name sounds Jarmin.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   &quot;He's either Jarmin or Iskimu,&quot; I says.   &quot;He's tall for an Iskimu,&quot; Hinnissy says, &quot;but I foted forhim, and I'll fote for him again.&quot;   &quot;He's not runnin', he's retired.&quot;   &quot;You mean the office of the prisidincy is faykint?&quot;Hinnissy asks.   I think for a while as I polish a glass, and I says,&quot;Yes.&quot;   &quot;Well who's prisidint now?&quot; Hinnissy, thinkin' that maybehis ship has no captain, is very alarmed.   &quot;Jarge Push is prisidint, and we haven't had a chiefexecutif like him since Roosifelt.&quot;   &quot;The one in the wheelchair?&quot;   &quot;No, the one on the rhinoceros. At the head and tail ofthe centuries, you get prisidints who's fourteen years oltrunnin' around bumpin' off animals smarter than them,spittin' up at state dinners, and generally puttin' the footin the mouth, but I suppose it's right to let the kids runthe country now and then.&quot;   &quot;Ah,&quot; says Hinnissy, &quot;that's why, at the last eliction,they passed out cigars that said `It's a boy]' I imagine someDimocrats want to replace him.&quot;   &quot;And Ripiblicans, too.&quot;   &quot;What Ripiblican would be so brazen as to run against theprisidint?&quot;   &quot;Well, there's that fella Bakunin.&quot;   &quot;The Rishin Rivolutionary?&quot;   &quot;No, an Irishman, just like you and me. Pat Bakunin. Along time ago, when he was a kid, he responded to one of themadvertisements that said, `Don't let a bully kick sand in yerface,' and it farged his whole character. Didn't you ever seehim on the telefision? Deep down inside him is aninety-pounder thrashin' on the beach.   &quot;But that,&quot; I says, &quot;is entoyerly inoffinsive compared toDavid Duke, who claims he's a Ripiblican the way LyndonLaRouche claims he's a Dimocrat. The press wants to forgetabout LaRouche and play up Duke, who, for them, is like thefruit-of-the-month-club, and all cherries, too -- and, who,without them, is a voice cryin' out in the vacuum cleaner ofspace.&quot;   &quot;Is this fella Duke a foyable candidate?&quot; Hinnissy asks.   &quot;He's got a slight resume problem.&quot;   &quot;Which is?&quot;   &quot;He's a Nazi.&quot;   &quot;Oh,&quot; says Hinnissy. &quot;We don't want one of them asprisidint, do we? Why, he might make a lot of trouble]&quot;   &quot;Don't worry,&quot; I says. &quot;Prisidint Push has got it allunder control. He's not a pumpkin like we had a while back.That Jimminy Cricket fella started out as prisidint, but inthe first week there was a tirrible accidint. Actually, itwas the CIA that done it.&quot;   &quot;Done what?&quot; asks Hinnissy, as innocent as ever.   &quot;Kilt him.&quot;   &quot;No]&quot;   &quot;Yes. They sent a death rabbit into the White House -- hehopped right in, the epitome of deception, and the guardsjust smoiled because they thought he was the Ister Boony.That Ister Boony ate up the prisidint.&quot;   &quot;And then what happened?&quot;   &quot;Then the CIA, the FBI, and the Interstate CommerceCommission gets together and grabs this little fella namedAlfred E. Neuman, and with minor plastic sargery and sometheatrical tooterin', no one ever knew the difference. You'vegot to ask yerself, Hinnissy, in whose interests would it beto have the Ister Boony kill the prisidint? Who benefits?&quot;   &quot;By God,&quot; says Hinnissy, &quot;I never asked myself that. ButDooley,&quot; he whispers, &quot;who told you this?&quot;   &quot;Oliver Stone.&quot;   &quot;Then it must be right,&quot; he says, reelin'.   &quot;Yes, and the great tragedy was that if it hadn't been forthat freckled imposter, Jimminy Cricket woulda ended the ColtWar.&quot;   &quot;But Rheinholt Rubin did that,&quot; Hinnissy protests.   &quot;Shhhhhh]&quot; I says. &quot;First of all, yer nivir supposed tosay that. Second of all, he did it by winnin' it, which waspointlessly mucho, instead of by surrenderin', which wouldhave been a sign of real strength.   &quot;And what about the Dimocrats, Dooley? Aren't they runnin'for prisidint this year?&quot;   &quot;They are. First, there's Grapeheart, who says he's notrunnin', but I don't believe it. He's got the best chance,because it's a rule of American politics that about ivry fouror five prisidints you've got to have one who looks like aprize harse radish, and Grapeheart's got the blue ribbon.That's why we say, `In God We Trust.' We trust that God willconsistintly provide for the Ripiblic someone who, if hishair was wrapped in a towel, could be mistaken for BetteMidler. And that person will be prisidint.   &quot;Then, there's the second in the field, Mario Coma, alittle Hamlet in upstate New York, who has been having apublic conversation with himself for a period of time thatworks out to just under one-twentieth of the total span ofthe existence of the Ripiblic, and the question that hastortured him is to run or not to run. It's been veryexistential and very entertaining. He's got two sure fotes --Albert Camus and Jean Paul Sartre.&quot;   &quot;But they're dead . . .&quot;   &quot;Since when does that matter? I do admit that, even thoughI'm a Ripiblican, I enjoy Mario's struggle with binaryquestions, and would like to see how he would handle suchmajor riddles as, `Is there water at the bottom of theocean?' and, `Can you run for prisidint a hundred and fiftyyears after you're dead?'&quot;   &quot;What about Sinitor Cherry of Nebarska?&quot; Hinnissy asks,glowing with pride in his detailed political knowledge. &quot;Hewas a hero in the war that Governor Clipclop rearranged tofit his resume.&quot;   &quot;Not a chance,&quot; says I. &quot;The Sinitor's a nice fella, buthe looks like a baby raccoon, and in the age of telefisionthat's a distinct disadvantage. But then there's his friend,farmer Sinitor Congos from the state that used to belong toDakookis before he made the mistake of ridin' around in atank, which alarmed the nation about the possibility ofelictin' a prisidint with a little tiny head. Congos andCherry has got huge soft eyes as big as archery targits, andall prisidints, even the ones who look like prize harseradishes, has got medium to hard eyes.   &quot;Besides, everyone knows that farmer Sinitor Congos isactually Mister Rogers. He's always had the kid fote, and nowhe wants the oval desk. Ask yourself, `In whose interestwould it be? Who benefits?' There's only one answer: The SoilConservation Service. They did it. They also transplantedHarold Stassen's brain into farmer Gofernor Brown.&quot;   &quot;Who told you that, Dooley?&quot;   &quot;Oliver Stone.&quot;   &quot;Is there no one to carry the standard?&quot; Hinnissy asks.   &quot;Oh yes,&quot; I says. &quot;If Sinitor Congo's pairsonality cultfails to sweep the nation, then the front runner remainsGovernor Clipclop, a man of integrity, a moral farce astridea harse.&quot;   &quot;I take it you don't like him.&quot;   &quot;Who would like Dan Quayle's evil twin? Granted, he's anatural wonder, the soul of Walter Mondale in the body ofBart Simpson.&quot;   &quot;It's the hair,&quot; says Hinnissy. &quot;It's better than JackKemp's. Why does he do it that way?&quot;   &quot;Maybe when he was a kid he climbed an electric pole. . .. You know how he kept on sayin' that the Flowers woman waslyin' when she said they had an affair for twelfe years? Doyou think he meant it was for 11.75 years?&quot;   &quot;In that case, why would he want to be prisidint?&quot;Hinnissy asks in a flash of brilliance. &quot;He could be the headof the IRS]&quot;   &quot;Hinnissy,&quot; I says, &quot;that's what a Dimocratic prisidintis.&quot;   &quot;Dooley, don't forget, it's a Dimocrat yer speakin' to. Ithink Governor Clipclop's got charisma. He reminds me of JackKennedy.&quot;   &quot;Jack Kennedy 'twaren't no porkypine. And what about thedraft?&quot;   &quot;Close the window,&quot; Hinnissy says. Then he points hisfinger at me and says, &quot;You Ripiblicans nivir talk about theissues. Yer all cowards.&quot;   &quot;Oh no we're not,&quot; I says. &quot;How's the economy?&quot;   &quot;What economy?&quot;   &quot;Hinnissy, that's not fair, but we do have issues.&quot; Ithought for a while.   &quot;Capital gains?&quot; asks Hinnissy, sarcastically.   &quot;Dinosaurs,&quot; I says. &quot;The raisin the dinosaurs died 'twasnot a meteorite. They was as fat as little Sununus, andcoulda sleeped all night in an ice chest. They was wiped out,exstincopated, because no one paid attention to the dinosaurmiddle class, and they didn't have affordable dinosaur healthcare. That,&quot; I says, &quot;is how they got exstincopated, and thatis how the Dimocrats want to get elicted.&quot;   &quot;Who told you such a tale, Dooley?&quot; Hinnissy wants toknow.   &quot;Who do ya think?&quot; I says. &quot;Ask yourself, `In whoseinterest would it be? Who benefits?'&quot;   ---   Mr. Helprin, a novelist, is also a contributing editor ofthe Journal.</TEXT></DOC>
