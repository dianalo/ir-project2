(letter to the editor)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Hobson-Dupont, Jack; Sorrell, James; Mastracchio, R.L.; Panosian,Jeff; Janukowicz, Laura.andM;</AUTHOR><DESCRIPT/><TEXT>Features give meaning to machine worldandM;In MacWEEK's Oct.andP;  31 Letters column, MacWEEK reader Craig R. Hannacomplained about some &quot;trivial and boring material&quot; in a previous issue.andO;It's true that readers make important decisions based on the timelyinformation about new products and market trends that your magazinepublishes.andP;  However, the more people-oriented articles give us the kind ofinformation that allows us to determine the meaning and significance ofevents in an industry based on machines.andM;Stories in the same issue about how people were rebuilding after theearthquake provided just this human element.andP;  These stories may not havehelped me decide whether to buy a Mac Portable or not, but one of them didprovide information about where I can send a donation to a trust fund for thechildren of one of the earthquake's victims.andP;  That's important informationbecause more unites the Mac community than a shared preference for one typeof computer.andM;Here's a helpful, handy hint for Mr. Hanna: In the future, if you findyourself reading something you consider boring or trivial, simply shift yourvision to a different column of text.andP;  I used this technique on your letter,and it worked just fine!andM;Jack Hobson-Dupont, presidentandM;Control Development Corp.andM;Haverford, Pa.andM;I beg to differ with the insensitive attitude expressed in Craig Hanna'sletter (MacWEEK, Oct. 31).andM;We, as humans in a technological world, often lose touch with reality, whichcame on shore as Hurricane Hugo and shook the earth in Northern California,with tragic loss of life.andM;Is Mr. Hanna related to the mindless cartoon apathy behind the painlessfantasizing in Hanna-Barberra cartoons?andM;James SorrellandM;Space Advisory CouncilandM;Boise, IdahoandM;Exxon refutes effectof spill on eaglesandM;While the article &quot;Macs help Alaskans offer bald eagles TLC&quot; (MacWEEK, Sept.andO;19), had good intentions, it contained some inaccuracies about the effect ofthe Exxon Valdez oil spill on Alaskan bald eagles.andM;The article stated that the Alaskan bald eagle population, the largest in ourcountry, has been &quot;decimated&quot; by the spill.andP;  This is simply not true.andP;  Only asmall portion of the bald eagle habitat was affected by the spill.andP;  Of the5,000 bald eagles that reside in shoreline areas affected by the spill, thereare 152 confirmed mortalities.andP;  While we deeply regret these mortalities, thebase population is large enough to ensure a rapid and complete recovery.andM;The article also incorrectly stated that there are 2,500 breeding pairs ofeagles in Prince William Sound.andP;  The number is closer to 500.andP;  A recent U.S.andO;Fish and Wildlife Service census shows a total of 2,200 adult eagles, ofwhich about 50 percent breed at any given time.andM;The article erroneously states that there is a 1 percent to 2 percentegg-hatching success rate among breeding pairs.andP;  The Fish and WildlifeService estimates that 40 percent of the breeding pairs successfully hatchedeaglets this year, compared with an approximately 70 percent norm.andP;  Thisyear's lower rate is largely attributed to an abnormally high level of humanactivity in certain breeding areas affected by the spill.andM;Exxon has spent $1.5 million this year to locate distressed eagles andrehabilitate those needing help.andP;  Of that, $200,000 was used to build andsupport a bird rescue center operated by Dr. James Scott in Anchorage.andP;  Scotthas received 19 bald eagles and has 11 still under his care.andM;R.L.andP;  Mastracchio technical managerandM;Exxon Co., USAandM;Alaska OperationsandM;Anchorage, AlaskaandM;MacWEEK responds: While no one has complete information about the effects ofthe Exxon Valdez oil spill on the environment of Prince William Sound, thesources cited in MacWEEK's story stand by their assessment of the spill'seffects on Alaska's bald eagle population.andM;Adobe's ATM gives lots of bang for the buckandM;I'm ecstatic with Adobe Type Manager Plus Pack.andP;  Our investment in ATMsoftware has been the most useful and best price-for-performance purchasewe've made this year.andM;Since 1984, my sole source of output has been a trusty ol' ImageWriter.andP;  Iwent through a dozen &quot;favorite&quot; ImageWriter-tailored fonts without achievingthe quality of output I expected.andP;  My System folder became bloated with morethan 4,000 Kbytes of various font bit maps/sizes (thank heavens forMasterJuggler!).andP;  All the while I lusted for Bookman and Palatino.andP;  But Icould never justify the expense of a PostScript LaserWriter for personal use.andO;Enter ATM.andM;Now, I realize the resolution of my ImageWriter hasn't changed, but theoutput of, say, Helvetica has significantly improved.andP;  And I've recoveredmore than 2,500 Kbytes of disk space while getting a much better fontselection.andP;  The same applies to screen output.andP;  I'm no longer locked in to12-, 14-, 24-point sizes but can choose the point size I think looks best, beit 8, 15 or 31!andM;Jeff Panosian, M.D.andM;How about starting aandM;global Mac users group?andM;Stuart Mark's letter (MacWEEK, Oct.andP;  31) led me to think of a very powerfulway to get Apple's attention: Start a global user group.andM;The company I work for has an independent users group that provides ideas forimprovement and innovation.andP;  We value their sug-gestions because we realizethat they reflect what our customers feel they need.andP;  Most of our softwarerevisions and additions are based on users' suggestions.andP;  Apple may besurprised at the intelligence of the average Macintosh user and could savesome valuable Randamp;D and marketing time simply by listening to an independentusers group.andM;Subscriptions could be handled by mail and presumably pay for staff to runthe organization and funnel information to Apple.andP;  Users could form variouscommittees: hardware, software, networks, etc.andP;  There could be local chaptermeetings, and an annual meeting at some central location.andP;  A bulletin boardcould be successful as well.andM;With the right marketing, the group could be incredibly effective and unitethe Macintosh community in a way no local users group can.andP;  I know I'd bemore interested in joining a specific group than a local group with morediverse interests.andM;Most of us are in this to make money.andP;  A global Apple users group would allowus to tell Apple what we want and need rather than make the company guess.andO;How about it folks, anybody out there interested?andM;Laura JanukowiczandM;Nashua, N.H.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
