Five patients with DRPLAand three healthy controls were evaluated using high-field-strength (1.5T) MR imaging. In the patients, restoration of signal was recognizedin globus pallidus (2 of 5), substantia nigra (2 of 5), red nucleus (5of 5) and dentate nucleus (4 of 5). Pons tegmentum atrophy was also seenin all patients. In normal control brains, globus pallidus, substantianigra, red nucleus and dentate nucleus were described as decreased intensityregion compared with caudate nucleus, putamen and thalums on heavilyT2-weight-ed images (SE 2000/80). This MR findings correlated closelywith the site of preferential accumulation of ferric iron using normalPerl's stained postmortem brains. The decreased signal intensity is dueto ferritin causes local magnetic field inhomogenesities, and is proportionalto the square of field strength. As to pathlogical changes of previouslyreported casen, the cell loss was the most severe in dentate nucleusin majority of the most cases and varied in red nucleus and globus pallidum,whereas a restoration was the most significant in the red nucleus inour results. The finding of restorstion may be a reflection of the functionaldepletion of MRI rather than the structural changes of cell loss in thered nucleus of DRPLA. The clinical feature of movement disorders is notnecessarily correlated with pathlogical changes such as the cell lossor atrophy. MRI is sensitive not only to structural changes but alsoto the functional or biochemical abnormalities.</TEXT></DOC>
