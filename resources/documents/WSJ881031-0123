What better day could International Business Machines Corp. and Microsoft Corp. choose to give their competitors a big scare?    The two companies today are announcing the long-awaited shipment of Presentation Manager, the final component of the much ballyhooed OS/2, a new operating system to control high-performance, IBM-compatible personal computers. Presentation Manager, a tricky piece of software five years in the making, creates images on the screen with dazzling speed and clarity, treating users to a visual desktop on which they can run programs and move data much like playing a video game.    Similar to the so-called &quot;graphical user interface&quot; that makes Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh such a hot seller, Presentation Manager enables software companies to design spreadsheets, database programs and word processors for IBM-compatible PCs that are both snazzy to look at and easy to use. IBM and Microsoft, which jointly developed the new software, are hoping the combination of Presentation Manager and OS/2, which can juggle several computing tasks at once, will catapult them back to the technological forefront of personal computers.    &quot;This is the milestone that changes the rules for everybody,&quot; contends William H. Gates III, the founder and chairman of Microsoft. &quot;OS/2 with Presentation Manager will be the environment for office computing in the 1990s.&quot;    Or so he hopes. While the shipment of Presentation Manager is a landmark for both companies, OS/2 still faces a long, tough battle to dominate the market. For one thing, Apple's Macintosh and a slew of technical workstations from Sun Microsystems Inc., Digital Equipment Corp. and others have operating systems and interfaces that already do much of what OS/2 and Presentation Manager are trying to accomplish. And earlier this month, Next Inc., Apple founder Steve Jobs's new company, practically redefined the term graphical user interface with a new computer that has an almost three-dimensional screen appearance.    Moreover, just to give the new software a test spin computer users will have to shell out at least $2,500 to equip their machines with a mouse pointing device and enough memory. And even though software developers praise the technical merits of OS/2 and Presentation Manager, they say it is difficult to write programs that take advantage of the new features. Even Microsoft won't predict when its own first Presentation Manager program, a souped-up version of its Excel spreadsheet, will come out.    &quot;I'm not saying Presentation Manager won't be important,&quot; says industry consultant Stewart Alsop, who calls the staged release of OS/2 components and programs &quot;a classic case of dribbleware.&quot; But he adds: &quot;In the time it's taken Microsoft and IBM to get all of the pieces of OS/2 out, the market has changed and in some ways the technology has passed them by.&quot;    There's another potential problem for Presentation Manager. Earlier this year Apple sued Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard Co., charging infringement of copyrights for certain visual features of the Macintosh graphical user interface. Microsoft contends that Apple granted it a license in 1985 allowing the use of certain graphical features of the Macintosh in a program called Windows, a precursor to Presentation Manager. Many industry analysts, however, expect the companies ultimately to settle the suit.    OS/2 does have its advantages. It can run all programs written for the original PC operating system -- Microsoft's MS-DOS -- without modification, albeit without the improved graphical interface of Presentation Manager. Also, 20 million IBM-compatible PCs have been sold, a third of which can be modified to run OS/2.    Still, it's up to Presentation Manager to win over computer users to OS/2. And what users will find when they first try Presentation Manager is a more prosaic screen than that of the Macintosh or the Next computer. (The Mac, for example, uses a trash-can symbol to dispose of unwanted files; Next shows a swirling black hole. Presentation Manager, though, offers a straightforward &quot;Delete&quot; command.)    The Presentation Manager screen features a turquoise &quot;desktop&quot; that shows symbols representing various programs and files for users to &quot;open&quot; and use. When opened, a program or document is displayed in a white window bordered in blue and yellow. To control the program, a user points the cursor to various &quot;pulldown menus&quot; -- lists of commands -- and selects a command by clicking a switch on the mouse, rather than typing a series of keystrokes. Several overlapping windows with operating programs can be open and running at once.    &quot;It isn't sexy like the Next computer or the Macintosh, but then the mainstream of the industry doesn't view sexiness as the key issue,&quot; says Mitch Kapor, the founder of Lotus Development Corp. and co-author of the Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet. (Nevertheless, Microsoft has hired a graphic designer who worked on the interfaces of both the Macintosh and the Next computer to help spiff up the look of future versions of Presentation Manager.)    Presentation Manager is the product of the same joint effort between IBM and Microsoft that came up with OS/2. Altogether 1,800 people -- 1,500 of them from IBM -- were involved in the projects. As it turned out, Presentation Manager was as big a programming challenge as the operating system itself. Both contain about 400,000 lines of programming code, which is why PCs have to have at least four megabytes of memory to run it efficiently -- more than six times the memory of most earlier MS-DOS PCs.    All the power and complexity of Presentation Manager, however, have created some problems for programmers. &quot;They overengineered it to the point that it's difficult for small software developers to deal with it,&quot; says Jeffrey Tarter, publisher of Softletter, an industry newsletter.    Although Microsoft sold 4,000 OS/2 developer kits to software companies and corporate programming departments, many that bought the $3,000 kits aren't yet writing programs. Some, such as Peter Roizen, president of T-Maker Research Co. of Los Gatos, Calif., threw up their hands when the kits, shipped in several large cartons, arrived.    &quot;I tried to make sense of it all, but it was too overwhelming,&quot; says Mr. Roizen. &quot;It's hard for a three-man company to get enthusiastic when they ship you 29 manuals, 130 disks, 8 videocassettes and two envelopes that say 'Open me first.'&quot;    That's not such a problem at larger companies, which are devoting more and more programmers and resources to OS/ 2. Dozens of them, including software industry heavyweights Lotus, Ashton-Tate Co., Borland International Inc. and Word Perfect Corp. all are planning OS/2 offerings in 1989.    &quot;I'm putting my money where my mouth is,&quot; says Fred Gibbons, chairman and chief executive of Software Publishing Corp. Mr. Gibbons is earmarking 35% of his programming budget to OS/2 projects. &quot;The homogeneity of the PC software market has been blown apart by OS/2, and we think there's going to be a big opportunity for those who get there first.&quot;    Despite all the hoopla about Presentation Manager and promises of more powerful programs, most computer users are content to wait a while longer before going to all that expense and trouble. &quot;At the moment, OS/2 doesn't buy you anything, and cost is very much in the forefront of our minds,&quot; says Fred Sass, manager of data communications for Liberty Mutual Life Insurance Co., Birmingham, Ala.    Not even Microsoft's Mr. Gates thinks OS/2 will catch on in a big way right away. He predicts that in 1989 only 12% of all new IBM-compatible computers sold will be equipped for OS/2, rising to 25% in 1990. In 1991, however, he expects 60% of all new machines will run the software.    &quot;Hey, we're not in any hurry,&quot; he says. After all, he notes, Microsoft's $50 million investment in OS/2's development &quot;is a luxury that has already been paid for by selling 20 million copies of MS-DOS.&quot;    Besides, Microsoft's intent all along was to make the next step for personal computing &quot;a big enough one to last us through most of the 1990s,&quot; he adds. &quot;So, if we did it right, there's plenty of time for us to make some money.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
