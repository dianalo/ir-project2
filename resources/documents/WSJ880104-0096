Schlesinger (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> GM </CO><IN> AUT </IN><TEXT>   A couple of years ago General Motors Corp. was considered an invincible giant. Now it is widely viewed as an incompetent dinosaur. But it has a weapon that the dinosaurs never had: money. And it plans to use a big chunk of it on an unusual campaign to get its reputation back.    The campaign opens this week. GM is virtually taking over the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York for three days, tomorrow through Thursday, for an exhibit called &quot;GM Teamwork andamp; Technology --for Today andamp; Tomorrow.&quot; Among other things, GM will cover a wall of the swank hotel's elegant ballroom with 240 choreographed television screens for regular showings of a 10-minute video extravaganza.    Although average citizens won't be invited to the display, they will certainly be bombarded with its message. GM is also trying to arrange for its chairman, Roger B. Smith, to tout the company in network television interviews. And over the next few weeks, GM expects to reach 60 million Americans with eight-page advertising inserts in such publications as Reader's Digest.    For the three days at the Waldorf and the eight-page ads, the No. 1 auto maker is shelling out an estimated $20 million. Is that a good idea? Even at GM, there are doubters.    Critics within the company call the hastily arranged event --a year's worth of planning was crammed into two months --a desperate effort by a struggling corporation to advertise its way out of troubles and to prop up the reputation of its embattled chairman. Some employees have branded it &quot;Rogerama.&quot;    &quot;We're capital-constrained on new products and we're renting the Waldorf for three days,&quot; one staffer gripes. &quot;It's basic insanity.&quot;    Top GM officials, however, say it's an important &quot;progress report to the nation&quot; --and to their employees --on a corporate overhaul they describe as &quot;heroic.&quot; Says John W. McNulty, the company's vice president for public relations: &quot;We want to show GM is alive and well, not only in the present day but going ahead into the 1990s. We can tell the story of what's been happening the past few years and how it's starting to pay off.&quot;    Privately, many company executives are more blunt. They say they want to stop --or at least drown out --what they feel has become a &quot;feeding frenzy&quot; of unfair &quot;GM bashing&quot; in the press and on Wall Street. Frustrated by its inability to get across what it beleives is a good story, GM, like Gary Hart, wants to &quot;let the people decide.&quot;    The Waldorf exhibit will be quite a start. GM will set up a real-life design studio in the hotel. It will hold a black-tie dinner with Chairman Smith presiding and nearly every GM executive attending. It will beam live reports to 150 plants and offices around the country.    By Thursday night, GM hopes to churn 14,000 of its closest friends through the exhibit: board members, dealers, suppliers, shareholders, advertisers, analysts, journalists, workers, senators, mayors, even schoolchildren. Basically, that is everybody GM wants to convince that, a streak of bad news notwithstanding, GM still leads America's leading industry.    In 1985, GM's six decades atop the world automotive industry seemed to reach new heights with a series of bold moves painted in billion-dollar strokes: its mega-purchases of Hughes Aircraft and Electronic Data Systems, its technological overhaul of its plants and the creation of Saturn Corp., a new small-car maker that is supposed to be fighting off the imports by 1990. In 1986 the Washington Journalism Review said GM had the best corporate public-relations staff in the nation.    Since then, it has been straight downhill. The announcement of 17 total or partial plant closings, the public fight with and controversial buy-out of EDS founder H. Ross Perot, the payment of executive bonuses in a year when workers received no profit-sharing, and sharp drops in profit, sales and market share have created an unbridled chorus of unflattering headlines.    The unfavorable coverage has focused not only on the corporation but also on Mr. Smith himself. Previously praised for his keen intellect, GM's chairman is now regularly and publicly ridiculed for his appearance, his social acumen, even the pitch of his voice. The skids have been greased by the fact that GM's two domestic rivals --Chrysler Corp. and Ford Motor Co. --have successively been labeled &quot;comeback of the century&quot; candidates for their breathtaking trips from heavy losses to high profitability.    The bottom line: Fortune magazine, in its annual ranking of about 300 companies from most-admired to least-admired, dropped GM from 16th in late 1985 to 254th in late 1987. When Mr. McNulty was introduced at a recent party as head of GM's public relations, he added, &quot;such as they are.&quot;    Frustratingly, the problem feeds on itself. Bad publicity hurts sales. Bad sales create more bad publicity. This past November, GM's share of new cars sold in the U.S. fell to 32.7%, nearly 15 points below its historical average.    In assessing the recent rough ride, some GM officials acknowledge that they themselves have been partly to blame. The company's flair for hyperbole --most notably its proclamation when Saturn was created that &quot;American industry will never be the same&quot; --promised more than it could possibly deliver. The Saturn project has since been scaled back.    GM also sometimes loses credibility by denying it has problems instead of acknowledging and explaining them. A late-1986press release announcing the pending closing of 11 plants began with the phrase &quot;General Motors has 'turned the corner.'&quot; Mr. Smith recently told the Detroit News that GM's higher dividend was more important than Ford's higher earnings.    But there is a growing sense both inside and outside the company that the mounting criticism is unfair. &quot;They do have many fine products,&quot; argues Christopher Cedergren, senior automotive analyst for J.D. Power andamp; Associates, a California car-marketing research firm. &quot;If their image was where it was three years ago, their market share would be higher than it is right now.&quot;    In a nutshell, GM's line is this: Despite criticism that the company is flailing about with flawed strategies, the appearance of problems comes from necessary but painful technological and organizational overhauls. Now that those transitions are largely completed, they are starting to pay off.    Specifically, the company will hype this week its new four-cylinder engine that provides the power of a V-8; its $5 billion new lineup of midsized &quot;GM-10&quot; cars, including the 1988 Pontiac Grand Prix, which copped Motor Trend magazine's prestigious Car of the Year award; and its Sunraycer, which won the first transcontinental solar-powered race in Australia. It will also feature future &quot;concept&quot; cars. And it will hammer home what it calls the new &quot;human partnership&quot; it forged with the United Auto Workers union in strike-free negotiations last fall.    All of this was conceived in October when Mr. Smith held a private preview of GM products for government leaders on Capitol Hill in Washington. He decided, says Mr. McNulty, that &quot;we really have a great story to tell in our products and we ought to carry that message further.&quot; The model, it was decided, should be the glitzy Motoramas of the 1950s, when GM regularly took over the Waldorf, hired Hollywood celebrities to hawk its new products, and drew crowds several blocks long to see the cars.    Thus began a flurry of activity culminating in this week's events. Design staffers have dropped future projects and are working round the clock to put together displays. The PR department has worked full time during the holiday break. The schedule of events has been changing daily, and Mr. Smith has been checking personally and frequently on the status of the planning.    The GM people emphasize that this isn't a party but, rather, a series of serious business meetings --albeit on a grand scale. On Thursday, for example, labor and management representatives from every GM plant, as well as mayors from every city with a GM plant, are invited. So are all the workers and families from the nearby Tarrytown, N.Y., and Linden, N.J., assembly plants. (Attendance for them shouldn't be a problem, since both plants are temporarily shut down, in part because of slow sales.)    It is supposed to be GM's largest public display of technology in its history. The 240-screen show &quot;is really spectacular,&quot; boasts Mr. McNulty. &quot;In one corner, you'll have 40 screens of a guy's head talking. All around him will be shots of {workers} getting retraining. There's nothing you've ever seen like it. It's very high-tech, very avant-garde.&quot;    But the most important question is, Will it all work?    &quot;Images come from performance,&quot; says Joel Portugal, a New York corporate-identity consultant. If GM truly has made the strides it claims, it could help somewhat, Mr. Portugal says. But he adds: &quot;If this company hasn't changed and they have an event like this, it's a disaster. If they cannot back it up, they've lost total credibility.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
