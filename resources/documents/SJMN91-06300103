It just came back to a television near you.;   This has not been thebest of weeks for American Express Co. Not only did the company report anunprecedented 91 percent drop in earnings for the third quarter, but a federalcourt judge in New York gave rival MasterCard the go-ahead for an ad thatAmerican Express calls false and misleading.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Business  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  COURT ALLOWS THE MASTERCARD AD THAT MIFFED AMERICANEXPRESS  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     The humorous -- at least to MasterCard -- ad features a hapless manwandering around Anytown, USA, looking for somewhere to get cash with hisAmerican Express card. People give him the kind of elaborate directions thatmake any driver groan, or tell him they just don't know where he should look.;  The refrain: &quot;Too bad he doesn't have a MasterCard.&quot;;   The last set ofdirections, delivered by an old woman, is to go through a corset store --&quot;they don't mind&quot; -- and head down a dirt road. The man is seen driving over abridge, ostensibly into oblivion.;   After the court decision Thursday,MasterCard leaped to put the ad back on national television during a WorldSeries game, ending a two-week temporary court-ordered halt. In the interim,MasterCard changed the ad copy slightly to mollify American Express, butMaureen Bailey, American Express vice president of public affairs, said itstill &quot;could easily give someone the impression that it would be difficult toobtain cash with (an American Express) card.&quot;;   She argued that along withmore than 43,000 automated teller machines, there are hundreds of airlines,hotels and other places where American Express cardholders can obtain cash.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Boston Globe  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  New York  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911026  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  October  </MONTH><PG.COL>  14D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  271  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday, October 26, 199100300103,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
