social structure, we develop models to help us interpret our experienceand guide our actions.andP;  Over millennia, humans have developed progressivelymore complex models of organization.andM;Our theory, upon which our model is based, helps us see what the human eyecannot: reality at a wavelength outside the electronic spectrum.andP;  Throughnetworking eyes, we can see the antecedents of today's organizations inhistory and culture.andM;STAGES OF HUMAN ORGANIZATION.andP;  Networks are very old and very new.andP;  Tounderstand what is new about networks and how they shape the new society ofthe Information Age, it is important to understand how old networking is andits fundamental people-to-people origin.andM;Hunting and Gathering Groups.andP;  Networking defined as &quot;people connecting withpeople&quot; may have been the great human social invention of the ancient Huntingand Gathering Age.andP;  Perhaps in parallel with the growing human capacity forlanguage, a level of cooperation and coordinated action was developed byhuman tribes that enabled the species to spread throughout the world.andM;Networking within and between small groups is an ancient human skill, sharedby all peoples.andP;  It is the skill that comes from within in our interpersonalrelations as part of a small group.andM;Agricultural Hierarchies.andP;  It is said that civilization began with theplanting of a seed.andP;  With the culture and technology of agriculture came agreat wave of human change.andP;  Human groups suddenly increased in size, fromtribal groups of a dozen to towns of hundreds to cities of thousands.andP;  A newform of human organization emerged: hierarchies.andM;Western civilization began in the great flood-plains of the Middle East.andO;Some theorists believe that the need for large-scale water control led to thetowering theocracies of Egypt and Mesopotamia, great human hierarchies toppedwith a deity.andM;In Japan, with its mountainous terrain and narrow valleys, controlling waterto enable agriculture required close cooperation among many small groupsleading, perhaps, to a more decentralized form of hierarchy.andP;  Rather than thesharp top with a paramount individual that is common in the West, Japanesehierarchy tends to be blunt, a group of powerful leaders.andP;  What held thefeudal system together were bonds of personal loyalty.andM;This form of a blunt hierarchy plays a little-recognized but important rolein the West, best known as &quot;old boy networks,&quot; meaning the interconnectedmembers of a controlling elite.andM;Industrial Bureaucracies.andP;  The second great wave of human change came in thecentralization of society and development of vast bureaucracies.andP;  In theWest, bureaucracy seemed to grow along with industry.andP;  Specialized,interdependent, formal, machine-like organization came with the steam engineand the assembly line.andM;While the West was developing centralized administrations for urbanindustrial centers, Japan was also centralizing its feudal system in theTokugawa Era.andP;  Instead of the kings and presidents of the West, however,Japan relied on &quot;councils of elders,&quot; group rather than individualleadership.andM;By the middle of the Industrial Era in the late eighteenth century,departmental bureaucracies became formalized through constitutions in boththe West and Japan.andM;INFORMATION NETWORKS.andP;  We are now on the crest of the next great wave ofhuman change based on new technologies and new global circumstances.andP;  Withthis great change are coming new forms of large-scale social organization.andO;These are the global networks emerging today.andM;Each form of organization has included the forms that came before.andP;  Today'sglobal networks include, rather than replace, hierarchy and bureaucracy.andO;Before considering further what is new about today's networks, let's look athow hierarchies, bureaucracies, and networks come together in a modernorganization.andM;MODERN FIRE ORGANIZATION.andP;  A network is a form of organization like hierarchyand bureaucracy.andP;  Complex organizations today have aspects of all three formsof organization.andM;One example common to both Japan and the United States is the local firedepartment.andP;  For three years in the 1970s, we helped the U.S.andP;  Department ofCommerce set up America's first national fire prevention agency.andP;  Japan'sfire rate is one of the lowest in the world.andP;  As you may know, the U.S.andP;  firerate is by far the highest in the world.andP;  Not a statistic we can be proud of.andM;In America, the fire-fighting part of the fire department is organized in astrict, military hierarchy.andP;  When faced with the crisis of actually fightinga fire, a well-trained unit following a chain of command seems to be theoptimal form of organization.andM;Another important part of every fire department is a bureaucraticadministration.andP;  This is the group of people concerned with buildinginspections, codes, violations, water mains, and all other laws and policiessurrounding the control of fires.andM;A third, often neglected, part of American fire departments is a network ofprevention and educational efforts.andP;  At the simplest level, this means thevoluntary cooperation of fire personnel with other community organizations tospread fire safety information.andP;  This is essentially small-group,person-to-person networking.andM;Fire departments also network at the community-to-community level.andP;  Althoughfire-fighting units are hierarchical, departments come together as equals inregional &quot;mutual aid&quot; associations.andP;  So, if one community has a very badfire, other surrounding departments will send direct aid, while departmentson the periphery will move in to fill in gaps left by the response.andP;  Here wehave a network of hierarchies.andM;Like other organizations, fire departments and professionals within them alsoform peer-to-peer associations at the state (prefecture) and national levelsto exchange information and influence policy changes.andP;  Many of these are likethe voluntary grassroots associations dedicated to causes like protecting theenvironment.andM;Modern fire departments, found in every community throughout the world, showthe basic forms of human organization applied to a specific function:hierarchical fire-fighting, bureaucratic codes, and networks of prevention.andM;TODAY'S ORGANIZATION.andP;  In the broad cultural context, global networks arebeing stimulated and shaped as the sociological response to electronic anddigital technology.andP;  They are the unique response to the driving forces ofinformation, just as hierarchy developed in the Agricultural Era andbureaucracy matured in the Industrial Era.andM;Network organizations based on global media are appearing in grassrootsmovements, large-scale organizations, and in everyday work.andP;  These networksoperate alongside, within, and between the hierarchy and bureaucracy in anylarge organization.andM;Global media are leading to a global workforce and global work.andM;Jessica Lipnack, president, and Jeffery Stamps, Ph.D., director of research,are cofounders of Networking Institute, Inc., a research and consultingcompany in West Newton, Massachusetts.andP;
