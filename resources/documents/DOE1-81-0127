In this study we have gained the neutron spectrum usefulto neutron dose-equivalent estimation and neutron shielding design atworking area in nuclear fuel facilities. Spherical moderating type neutronspectrometers using He-3 counter and 4 different thickness polyethylenemoderators were arranged to be used in the measurements. The responsefunctions of these spectrometers were obtained by the adjoint calculationof ANISN-W code, and calibrated at the neutron standard fields. Neutronspectrum were calculated by mean of unfolding NEUPAC code and SAND-IIcode. The measured neutron spectrum in the facilities have some peaksin fast neutron region corresponding to the neutrons from Pu spontaneousfissions and O ({alpha}, n) reactions caused by {alpha}-particles emittedfrom Pu respectively and form 1/E-shape spectrum below 50 keV. The 1/E-shapespectrum is due to the scattering component of neutrons. The method ofneutron dosimetry based on the spectrum obtained is discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
