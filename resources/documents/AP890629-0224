Government officials make no secret that it is anotherSoviet-supplied Scud-B missile, the heaviest weapon used so far inthe decade-long war against Moslem guerrillas known as themujahedeen.   When the missiles come over it is always just before dawn; onlytheir targets and directions are changed _ somewhere in themountains or plains outside Kabul.   To Omar Khan and others in the capital the missiles are areminder that while Soviet forces have withdrawn from Afghanistanthe fighting goes on. And people are weary of it, even though it isfar away, except for the times guerrilla rockets fall erratically inthe city.   ``There is a struggle here between two great powers, but we arethe ones dying,'' said the 52-year-old Khan, who sells plastic shoesin Kabul's old bazaar. ``The Russians and the Americans are talkingto each other about limiting atomic weapons, but both are sendingrockets and bombs to kill our people. Why? What is our guilt?''   When Moslem guerrillas overran his village in eastern Kunarprovince in 1980, Khan and his family packed the few belonging theycould carry, left their small farm and walked 125 miles to thecapital.   He set up a small wooden stand in the bazaar, where veiled womendisplay fruits, nuts and spices and the shouts of peasants sellingcamel legs compete with the muezzins calling the Moslem faithful toprayer at the city mosques.   Four of Khan's seven sons have died in the war. Two still fighton the side of the guerrillas, and he worries that his onlysurviving child will be called for military duty to fight theguerrillas, possibly even his brothers.   ``Forget? You can't forget about this war,'' Khan said, speakingthrough an interpreter. ``But what are we supposed to do? Run andhide?''   During the 11 years that the guerrillas have been fighting tooverthrow the Soviet-backed government, the harshest of consequenceshave fallen on the civilians. Many if not most of the 1.3 millionkilled in the war have been civilians.   The guerrillas control Afghanistan's countryside, but it is thecities they must capture.   That they have failed so far to do, and with casualties rising onboth sides, doubt is growing that either side has the power to breakthe impasse.   ``We are simple, poor people,'' Khan said. ``Our families may bewith the government, they may be with the mujahedeen. But this hasto stop.''   While he and others in the bazaar praise the guerrillas for theirstruggle against the Soviet forces that intervened to help theMarxist government in 1979, they remain apprehensive about thefundamentalist guerrilla leaders and of the destruction the rebelsinflicted while seizing provincial towns.   And even among those who speak contemptuously of the government,the tendency is to question the decision of the United States tocontinue arming the guerrillas after the Soviets left Feb. 15.   Guerrilla projectiles _ almost always are Chinese-made107mm-rockets packed with shrapnel and designed to spray jaggedmetal shards over a wide area _ are fired at random from the rebels'mountain hideouts about 15 miles outside Kabul. They usually land onhouses, courtyards, parks and mosques but seldom on the intendedtargets _ military outposts, government installations and theairport.   In the wards at Indira Gandhi Children's Hospital, feelings arestrongest among the doctors trained by Westerners before war erupted.   ``We would like to see the world's two most powerful countriestrying to help us, not destroy us,'' said Dr. Mohammad Jalail as hechecked an 11-year-old boy whose legs had to be amputated after arocket slammed into a park where he was playing.   ``I am not a politician, but those who supply these weaponsshould think. If they were here and they could see this, how wouldthey feel? Would they want to continue sending the weapons or wouldthey think it better to help us with the medicines and food wereally need?'' said the California-educated Jalail.   Few people in Kabul expect a unified opposition to emerge. And ifthe war continues, many fear the uneasy alliance between the sevenPakistan-based guerrilla groups could rupture, creating a country sodivided by a warlord system that no outside influence would belikely to control.   Most believe that almost any negotiated settlement would bebetter than one won on the battlefield.   A common preference seems directed toward an ill-definedcompromise that would install a government that would be neitherMarxist nor committed to Islamic fundamentalism.   One hope is that some outside force will end the fighting andrestore peace. One who is frequently mentioned is the exiled KingMohammad Zahir Shah, dethroned by a military coup in 1973.   ``He was a good king, and he isn't killing anybody,'' Khan said.   Now 74 years old, Zahir Shah lives in Rome. But most diplomats inKabul say the chances of his playing a significant role are notrated very highly, partly because of allegations among someguerrilla groups that his personal behavior as king fell short ofthe standards expected of a devout Moslem.   But the yearning for a solution runs deep.   ``The Americans give bombs to the mujahedeen; the Russians givebombs to the government,'' Khan said. ``The Americans don't die andthe Russians don't die. Only Afghans died. It's time to say, `OK,enough. Finished.'''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Wed PMs July 5</NOTE></DOC>
