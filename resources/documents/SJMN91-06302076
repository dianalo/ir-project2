She lived life for the minute. She lived it to thefullest.&quot;;   Mathews took a deep breath, sank into his leather chair and heldback tears. He slowly recounted the events that led to the death of his wife,who suffered from a terminal disease, pheochromocytoma, that attacked heradrenal glands.;   &quot;We took the first exit . . . and stopped as soon as wecame up to an umbrella that was near the road,&quot; said Mathews, assistant to thecity manager of Westlake Village.;   The couple got out of their car andwatched as rolling black clouds moved up a canyon, swallowing the yellowumbrellas that dotted the hillsides.;   &quot;The clouds were moving toward us,&quot;Mathews said. &quot;Then we were hit with the wind.&quot;;   A huge gust whipped anumbrella about 40 feet away, leaving it teetering on its stand, Mathews said.;  &quot;We tried to step back across the road to get away from it,&quot; he said. &quot;Lorihunched over to try to keep the wind out of her contact lenses.&quot;;   Then,after a tremendous gust, the umbrella broke loose.;   &quot;It blew over sidewaysand came at us,&quot; Mathews said. &quot;I grabbed Lori's jacket to try to pull heraway.&quot;;   But it was too late, he said.;   &quot;It hit my knee and spun me to theground,&quot; Mathews said. &quot;Then it hit Lori and threw her into the rocks.
