A bitter debate over resettlement costs is pitting SovietAshkenazis _ Jews of European descent _ against Sephardis, those ofNorth African and Middle Eastern origin. The Sephardis complainthat the new immigrants may further block poor Israelis from movingup the social scale.   Although the argument has been spearheaded by Sephardiactivists, it appears to enjoy some support among other Israelis.   On radio call-in shows and in letters to newspapers, someIsraelis have complained about absorption costs and even suggestedthat immigrants be put in tent camps, like the Jews who arrived inthe 1950s.   The dispute reached its peak last week when a Sephardi militant,Yamin Suissa, announced he sent a telegram to President Mikhail S.Gorbachev and President Bush, asking them to curb the Soviet Jewishexodus.   ``I don't see people accepting these immigrants with a bearhug,'' Suissa said. ``People still have a feeling in their gutstowards the immigrants and I'm expressing exactly what they arefeeling.''   Suissa's followers and other Sephardi groups held a protestoutside Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's home, handing out soup tothe poor and demanding that Israel deal with social problems beforeencouraging more immigrants.   An angry Natan Sharansky _ a human rights champion who spentnine years in Soviet labor camps before immigrating in 1986 _ senta letter to Shamir, saying Suissa's statements ``contradicted ...the very idea of immigration.''   Another former Soviet prisoner, Yosef Begun, said: ``You knowthat people sat in jail and suffered to come to the land of Israel,so it is sad for us to hear such ideas, that the Israeli peopledon't need the Jews of Russia.''   Others complain that Suissa's ideas run against Israel's Law ofReturn, which promises citizenship to any Jew.   The wave of immigration is expected because of Soviet ethnicunrest and economic troubles, as well as Moscow's liberalizedemigration policy and tighter U.S. immigration rules.   In January-November of this year, 62,540 Jews left the SovietUnion, of which only 9,120 came to Israel, according to thequasi-governmental Jewish Agency here.   Hoping to draw 300,000 Soviet Jews in the next three years,Israel has announced a $3 billion resettlement plan. The governmentwants to gather one-third of that sum from donations and loans,mostly from the United States.   That large sum has frightened many Israelis.   ``Today, when we have half a million citizens living in poverty,the state must maintain the balance, absorb new immigrants but alsoimprove living conditions of old immigrants,'' said ElieBen-Menachem, a Parliament member of Sephardi descent from thecenter-left Labor Party.   Ben-Menachem, speaking to 200 activists from such neighborhoods,referred to figures showing that 487,939 of Israel's 4,477 millioncitizens were living in poverty in 1988, with a monthly income ofless than $390 per couple.   Marko Ohaion, head of a residents' committee in a working-classneighborhood of Beersheba, told the daily Yediot Ahronot thatunless the government deals with the 8.8 percent unemployment ratein addition to absorbing immigrants, ``the tension will becomeunbearable.''   Sephardi activists tend to see the problem as an ethnic issue.At a rally of Sephardic neighborhood leaders, shouts arose that``Ashkenazim need immigration to become a majority,'' the dailyHaaretz reported.   Sephardi Jews, including third-generation immigrants, constituteup to 55 percent of Israel's Jewish population.   About 20 percent of Sephardi Jews are considered to be poor,said Yohanan Peres, a Tel Aviv University expert on Israeli ethnicconflicts.   He noted that anti-immigrant emotions surfaced in the 1970s asimmigrants began receiving improved housing loans and couldpurchase many tax-free goods. Now, he said, the feelings are evenstronger</TEXT></DOC>
