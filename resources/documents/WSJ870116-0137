The transaction could carry a value of as much as $2.5 billion, based on the A-340's price of between $75 million and $80 million.    The West German carrier's long-awaited decision is a big boost for Airbus, which is seeking purchase commitments from five major airlines by the end of March so it can proceed with the new plane and a larger companion model, the A-330. Lufthansa was weighing the A-340 against the MD-11, an update of McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s DC-10 tri-jet, to replace the airline's current fleet of 11 DC-10s.    Separately, Air France yesterday said it &quot;is considering&quot; an order of six or seven Airbus A-340s in the early to mid-1990s.    Lufthansa said it will order its 15 four-engined A-340s for delivery beginning in 1992 and will take the plane in two versions: the A-340-200, which will be able to carry 220 passengers and 11 tons of freight about 8,000 nautical miles; and the A-340-300, which will carry 256 people and 15 tons of cargo for 7,000 miles.    Significantly, Lufthansa said it will order the planes equipped with the new V-2500 SuperFan engine from International Aero Engines AG. The engine maker late last month decided to launch this new technology, propeller-jet hybrid engine because its previous offer, the straight V-2500, lacked sufficient power. Lufthansa already has ordered V-2500 engines for the 40 Airbus A-320 twin-jets it has on order and option, and wanted a common engine for the A-340. Until the engine maker made its most recent offer, industry sources say, Lufthansa was forced to consider the competing McDonnell Douglas MD-11 more seriously.    International Aero Engines is a consortium of Rolls-Royce Ltd., United Technologies Corp.'s Pratt andamp; Whitney Group, Japanese Aero Engines Corp., Fiat Aviazione S.p.A., and MTU Motoren-andamp;-Turbinen-Union Muenchen G.m.b.H. It isn't known how much the SuperFan engine will cost. The competing engine for both A-320 and A-340 is the CFM56-5 made by a partnership of Snecma of France and General Electric Co. of the U.S.    Lufthansa said it chose the A-340 for its new technology and operating efficiencies and is confident that the SuperFan engine will be available by 1992. The company declined to comment on the price or the financing of the new planes.    A spokesman in Frankfurt said the supervisory board hopes that Lufthansa's purchase decision will encourage the governments of West Germany, Britain and France to provide the launch funding necessary to get the $2.5 billion A-340/A-330 project off the ground. Airbus partners Aero Spatiale of France, British Aerospace PLC and Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm G.m.b.H. of West Germany have asked their governments for funding. (The fourth Airbus partner is Construcciones Aeronauticas S.A. of Spain.) </TEXT></DOC>
