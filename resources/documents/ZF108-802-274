(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>The latest Coopers andamp; Lybrand/DATAMATION survey of chief information officersreveals that CIOs are dangerously disconnected  from the business side of thehouse, customers and the executive's own users.andM;In recent years, a cottage industry has grown up around the notion of thechief information officer  (CIO).andP;  The CIO was to be an executive whostraddled the worlds of business and technology and aligned the two.andP;  Theidea caught on in the 1980s and today nourishes not only the top is officerswho usually fill the role but also the consultants, executive search firmsand media that give the CIO industry its life.andP;  A new survey of the nation'stop is officers, however, shows that the CIO movement could be unraveling atthe seams.andM;&quot;Our 1990 survey is a series of red warning flags that point to dangersahead,&quot; says Ron Brzezinski, a partner at the accounting and consulting firmof Coopers andamp; Lybrand, who directed the Coopers andamp; Lybrand/DATAMATION CIOsurvey.andP;  &quot;And the dangers are many.&quot;andM;The previous two surveys, in 1988 and 1989, both showed that is executiveswere battling unsympathetic corporate cultures and losing.andP;  These battles arestill being fought.andP;  But this year's new survey of top IS executives at over400 of the nations' top 1,000 companies shows CIOs to be their own worstenemies.andP;  Their biggest battle is with themselves.andP;  Many are still clingingto a paternalistic view of information systems users, seeing them assomething to be controlled and manipulated rather than served.andP;  Thus, few ofthem relish the thought of managing in a decentralized environment, sincethey yearn for something they can control and get their arms around, not forsome amorphous organizational culture that makes control more difficult.andM;This is why many is executives interpret the CIO role as leader or is czar.andM;They are reluctant to serve the corporation,&quot; says Brzezinski, once a CIOhimself at the Quaker Oats Co.andM;Being a servant of the corporation means being available to end users and thecompany's customers.andP;  It is apparent from the way top is officers managetheir time that this isn't the case.andM;Over 62% of their time is spent just running the is organization-23.3% of itsolely behind a desk.andP;  &quot;They are not getting out, not in touch,&quot; saysBrzezinski, who adds, &quot;you can't align the worlds of business and technologyfrom behind a desk.&quot;andM;CIOs aren't just spending less time with their own end users than theyshould, they are largely ignoring their ultimate customers, the people andcompanies their firms actually sell to.andP;  Only 2.7% of CIOs' time is spentwith their companies' customers, thus making it difficult for them to handlethe business issues associated with is within their own companies.andP;  Thisseems to imply that CIOs are denying themselves direct experience with theirultimate customers, relying instead on indirect information from businessmanagers within their own companies.andP;  A telling statistic is that CIOs spendfar more time (4.4%) at industry conferences-many of which discuss what therole and the agenda of the CIO should be-than in front of their companies'customers.andM;When asked how they should allocate their work schedules, the CIOs said theywished to reduce their desk time to about 19% of the total and would spendmore time (6.2%) with the company's customers and speaking at and attendingconferences  (5.7%).andP;  But both figures are lower than the 8.7% of their time(just over four weeks) they would like to spend on vacation and personaldays, activities which currently consume 7.7% of the CIOs' time.andM;Not Enough Business SavvyandM;A lack of direct business experience is apparent in other statistics, aswell.andP;  Only 20% or so of CIOs were promoted or transferred to the topcomputer executive job from business management positions within theircompanies.andP;  Almost 6% came Prom operations, 5% from finance, about 2% fromplanning, 1% from marketing/sales, close to 1% from administration and 5%from the Other category.andP;  The remaining 80% were either hired or promotedfrom is positions, with 50% coming from other companies and 30% promoted fromis jobs within their own companies.andP;  Of the 80% hired from outside, 24% ofthe hires came from executive search firms.andM;CIOs don't seem to be highly in touch with the computer industry at largeeither, as a quiz on their general knowledge revealed.andP;  The CIOs were giventhe 20-question quiz at the Coopers andamp; Lybrand CIO Forum held this spring inMiami.andP;  The average age of CIOs taking the quiz was 47 years.andP;  Nearlytwothirds of all of them earn $100,000 or more per year, with 6.5% earningmore than $300,000.andP;  On average, they had been in the industry for 20 years.andO;The most questions even answered was 15, and the best score was 9, a failinggrade by school standards.andP;  Almost 20% of those answering didn't know thatIBM's current flagship operating system is MVS.andP;  Forty percent didn't knowthe name of the head of the world's largest independent software vendor,Charles Wang of Computer Associates International Inc. Only 80% knew thatDigital Equipment Corp.'s latest supermini is called the 9000 series.andP;  Andnone at all knew that the series number of IBM's first general purposecomputer was the 70 1.andM;The quiz is hardly scientific, but it does suggest that CIOs may be losingtouch with their technological roots as well as with the business side.andP;  Thisimpression is further confirmed in the Coopers andamp; Lybrand/DATAMATION 1990 CIOsurvey.andP;  To assess the impact of five areas on their jobs in the 1990s andtheir degree of preparedness to handle issues arising in those areas,respondents were given a scale of 1 (minimal) to 10  significant).andP;  The fiveareas were business environment, IS organization, technology, applicationsand globalization.andP;  Under these five categories were listed a total of 29issues.andP;  An average score of 7 or more was registered for only eight of the29 issues.andP;  Scores of 7 and 8 mean the issue has above-average significance.andO;Scores of 5 and 6 were the norm and indicated that the issues were of onlyaverage concern or had average impact.andM;In the turbulent 1990s, when the only rule seems to be everything is changingat all times, these scores not only show a lack of preparedness but a lack ofurgency and intensity.andP;  &quot;The CIOs seem to be comfortable without just cause,&quot;says Brzezinski.andM;Many of the CIOs were caught short by the PC they weren't ready for it theyfought it, and lost.andP;  &quot;Now as we move into the multimedia technology decade,there's a danger of the same thin happening again, warns the Candamp;L partner.andO;Integrating and applying multimedia technologies for business solutions wasone of the 29 categories.andP;  CIOs rated it only 18th on the job impact scalewith a 6.1 7.andP;  In terms of preparedness, it scored a tiny 5.23 and was only23rd on the list.andM;Perhaps the CIOs' response to the issue of outsourcing was the most amazingof all.andP;  This category scored a 4.28 on impact and a 4.82 onpreparedness-26th and 25th, respectively.andP;  One leading is executive wasastonished at this score, and echoed the view of many is leaders polled bytelephone after the survey results were known.andP;  &quot;Any is executive who doesn'tput outsourcing near the top of his or her list of concerns simply isn'tliving in the real world  says Harry Wallaesa, vice president of MIS at theCampbell Soup Co. of Camden, Nj.andP;  You have to perform a make or buyevaluation on everything you produce within the is organization.andP;  Anyone notconcerned about outsourcing is not concerned about the cost of the serviceprovided to clients.&quot;andM;The most staggering thing about the general knowledge quiz and the survey isthat these answers come from the nation's is elite: 19% of those respondingactually bear the title of CIO, up from 14% three years ago.andP;  A further 35%are at the vice presidential level, up from 32% in 1988.andP;  Most remarkable ofall, however, is that almost 52% of these executives viewed themselves astrend-setting users of is technology.andP;  Only 32% said they were &quot;average&quot; andless still, 16%, saw themselves as  followers.&quot; This answer seems to suggestthat these is executives feel they are prepared for the uncertain 1990s.andM;&quot;They are answering emotionally,&quot; counters Brzezinski.andP;  &quot;Nobody can bear thethought of being a follower or merely average, but statistically, many CIOsmust fall into these categories.&quot;andM;Brzezinski says that this setf-delusion is the single biggest danger CIOsface in the 1990s, but that it's not too late for them to turn things around.andO;It'll mean a personality change for many of them.andP;  &quot;andM;The first thing CIOs must do, Brzezinski says, is transfer their loyalty fromtheir profession to the companies they work for.andP;  Many are reluctant to doso, he feels, because demand for computer-related skills has been so greatthat job hopping Often nets Is specialists lucrative advances in terms ofsalary, benefits and promotion.andP;  Thus, Is workers tend to be moreprofessionthan organization-oriented.andP;  Their interest is in using theorganization to develop personal skills that will be more marketable in thechurning computer-related job market.andM;The higher up the IS executive career ladder a person goes, the morenoticeable the job hopping becomes.andP;  The CIO survey shows that directors ofis are more stable than VPs and CIOs.andP;  just over 45% of the directors havehad one other top job in their career.andP;  Over 31% of those carrying the vp istitle have had three or more top jobs in their careers.andP;  At the rarefiedheights of the CIO almost 51% have had three or more top positions.andM;Over one third of the total survey population have been the top is people intwo companies other than their present employers.andM;In the finance sector, this job hopping is more noticeable-and morelucrative-than in other business segments.andP;  Recruiters say that CIOstypically earn $350,000  in the financial services sector, compared with a 125,000 average in the Candamp;L survey population as a whole.andP;  It's not uncommon,they add, for financial industry CIOs to be paid $1 million + salaries.andP;  Eachtime these top is officers shift companies, they typically hike theirsalaries by around 25%, say experts.andM;This high-stakes job hopping has not only hyperinflated CIO salaries andbenefits, but has had two other consequences as well.andP;  One result shows up ina survey fin CIOs identify human resource executives as their leastsupportive executives.andP;  This is confirmed by john 1.andP;  Davis, head of New YorkCity-based executive search firm john J. Davis andamp; Associates.andP;  &quot;One, it'sturned the VP [of] Human Resources into an enemy of the CIO,&quot; says Davis,whose company makes its money placing IS executives in the  200,000-a-yearand up range.andP;  The reason is that the well-ordered salary and benefitsstructure of the human resources department is thrown out of whack with everyCIO job hop.andP;  The Candamp;L survey shows that the vice president of humanresources' is far and away the least supportive of the CIO amongst allexecutive classes.andM;The second result of the CIO job hopping.andP;  is that IS executives arereplicating solutions at each company they go to.andP;  &quot;It's human nature toreproduce what worked in the past,&quot; says Brzezinski,  but it's the wrongthing to do.andP;  CIOs must take a fresh look at today's problems.&quot; He believesthe mean age of the survey population, 47 years, prevents many from doingthis.andP;  &quot;They've become set in their ways.&quot;andM;The sales and marketing side of the CIO's company, in particular, is likelyto be most upset by regurgitated is solutions, since these areas'requirements change constantly, and they are looking for innovative tools tohelp them keep ahead of customers.andP;  That's why the VP of sales/marketing wascited by CIOs as the second least supportive member of the executive suite.andM;Brzezinski believes that CIOs must transfer their loyalty from the isprofession to the company and become servants of the corporation.andP;  Hebelieves that, if those two steps are taken, CIOs will begin to transformthemselves from self-deluded outsiders to in-touch agents of change.andP;  But afurther step is also required.andP;  CIOs must discover who their allies are.andP;  &quot;Italso helps to know who your friends are,&quot; he adds.andP;  The CIOs identified thatthe CFO is their biggest supporter.andP;  And yet this is the executive that topis executives least want to report to.&quot; Brzezinski notes that most CIOs  82%)feel they can have more impact in their companies by reporting to either theCEO or chief operating officer.andP;  He says, though, that the CIO should not tolose the CFO's support.andP;  Business Managers' PowerandM;But even if these steps are taken, and the reporting relationships work well,there is a school of thought that insists that it is already too late forCIOs, that, in essence, the whole movement is doomed.andM;&quot; It's not ego problems, or rigid personality, or even being out of touchthat will sink the movement,&quot; says Positive Support's Janulaitis.andP;  &quot;It'ssomething else entirely.&quot; Janulaitis and others stress that the control oftechnology is being transferred away from the is organization and into thehands of business managers.andP;  These managers have the business ;kills thatout-of-touch CIOs lack.andP;  They also increasingly have control of the is budgetand can use outside companies to get the applications they need.andM;&quot;Is executives that can't work with these business managers will becomeredundant,&quot; says Walter X. Kane, a 30-year IS veteran and vice president ofis for the Neponset Valley Health System Inc. of Norwood, Mass.andP;  &quot;Even thosethat can may suffer a similar fate.&quot;andM;The Candamp;L survey shows that the new business managers are already ascending incompanies.andP;  The average annual IS budget at companies on the survey was CIOseto $86.6 million.andP;  CIOs controlled $32 million of this directly and approved$18.5 million of indirect spending.andP;  That leaves $36.1 million, or almost 42%of the total, in the hands of th business managers.andP;  &quot;And everywhere you lookthe percentage is growing,&quot; says Kane.andM;As technology becomes more of a commodity and further standards emerge,companies probably won't need a large is organization, many experts believe.andO;A small team of advanced technologists headed by a chief technology officermay be sufficient for companies to create the pipes and connections that willlink their computer networks.andM;For CIOs, the choice seems to come down to two things: they can stay in ashrinking backwater operation-the data center, in essence-or seek new growthwithin their organizations as business managers.andP;  To go down the latter road,they must open up their personalities and connect.andP;  They must come out frombehind their desks and from behind their notion of the CIO as a leader and DPczar.andM;&quot;We've got to become the kind of person that gets a kick out of helpingothers succeed-the type that goes to a party and leaves his ego at the door,&quot;advises Bruce Brinick, vice president of is at the Aviation Office of AmericaInc. in Dallas.andP;  &quot;We've got to stop being the reluctant servant.&quot;andM;How CIOs Rate the IssuesandM;On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the most significant, CIOs rate theimpact of various if issues on their jobs and their preparedness in dealingwith these issues.andM;PreparedandM;-                Business Environment           impact   nessandM;Increased management expectations              7.47      6.72andM;Embedded IS in products, services              6.49      5.90andM;Reshaping business processes                   7.24      6.01andM;The IS role in changing company cultures       6.41      5.67andM;Sharing applications management andamp; ownershipandM;with business units                            6.34      6.35andM;Linking the business to suppliersandM;and customers via IS                           6.44      5.83andM;Peer/CIO politics                              6.04      6.00andM;Establishing a strategic role for IS           7.18      6.54andM;IS credibility                                 7.64      6.92andM;IS OrganizationandM;Retraining, acquiring andamp; keeping IS staff skills7.51      6.51andM;Redefining technology, data andamp; applicationsandM;strategies andamp; architectures                     7.44      6.40andM;IS career paths                                6.04      5.57andM;Changing centralization/decentralizationandM;roles andamp; responsibilities                       6.01      6.11andM;CASE tools changing the development process    5.80      4.84andM;Outsourcing of services                        4.28      4.82andM;Repositioning/restructuring theandM;extended data center                           4.96      5.35andM;TechnologyandM;Integrating andamp; applying multimediaandM;technologies                                   6.17      5.23andM;Desktop complexity andamp; support                   6.71      5.91andM;Consolidation of technologyandM;vendors andamp; alternatives                         5.58      5.86andM;Major new technology products                  6.11      5.87andM;Establishing andamp; maintaining enterpriseandM;technology standards                           6.43      6.06andM;Managing andamp; supporting new generations of LANS  6.51      6.06andM;ApplicationsandM;Rebuilding the application infrastructure      7.27      6.21andM;Expert systems or Al as integral componentsandM;of business systems                            5.29      4.18andM;Managing the enterprise data repository        7.04      5.85andM;Managing the enterprise software repository    6.50      5.94andM;GlobalizationandM;Worldwide systems development                  3.52      3.28andM;Worldwide operations                           3.52      3.39andM;1992 changes                                   4.20      4.03andM;Source:Coopers andamp; Lybrand/DATAMATION 1990 CIO Surv,</TEXT></DOC>
