The National Association of Business Economists said optimismamong its members has risen appreciably since the last surveyconducted in the month following the Oct. 19 plunge in stock prices.   In November, more than half of the business economists werepredicting a recession would begin before the end of 1988, anoutlook that could have spelled bad news for Republican hopes ofholding onto the White House.   Now, the number of economists expecting a recession this yearhas dropped to about one-fourth.   ``As we move farther away from October, we are a little lessnervous. We are seeing continued improvement in manufacturing andother good signs that the expansion will keep going,'' saidKathleen Cooper, chief economist for Security Pacific National Bankof Los Angeles.   The next president is likely to face a recession soon aftertaking office, the analysts believe, with about 60 percent of thempicking 1989 as the most likely year the downturn will begin.   But for 1988, the economists are projecting further growth at amodest pace, stable interest rates and a slight drop in inflation.   The analysts predicted that the economy, as measured by thegross national product, will expand just 2 percent this year, downfrom a 3.9 percent GNP increase in 1987, when measured from thefourth quarter of 1986.   This is more pessimistic than the Reagan administration, whichis calling for GNP growth this year of 2.4 percent.   Ms. Cooper, who compiled the association's survey, said thedecline in the stock market caused the majority of economists toreduce their growth forecasts for this year, but she said most ofthem had cut back their projections by less than 1 percent.   ``Economists see the largest effect of the market's plunge onconsumer spending for durable goods,'' she said, noting that theyare now expecting car sales to total only 9.8 million units thisyear, down from an expectation of 10.5 million sales made beforethe market decline. The forecast of housing starts also was trimmedto 1.52 million units this year, compared to 1.62 million newhouses built in 1987.   Ms. Cooper said the analysts expect growth to be most sluggishin the first half of the year, as businesses cut back on productionto reduce high inventories. GNP growth will average 1.5 percent inthe first six months and then improve to 2.5 percent growth for therest of the year, the economists forecast.   This sluggish growth rate will not be enough to keep theunemployment rate from rising. The economists forecast thatunemployment, which now stands at 5.8 percent, will rise to 6.1percent by the end of the year.   But the slow growth will help to keep inflation from getting outof control. The analysts predicted that consumer prices will rise4.2 percent this year, slightly slower than the 4.4 percentincrease in 1987.   In other predictions, the economists said:   _Interest rates, as measured by the prime lending rate, willstay steady. Banks cut their prime rate, used to set interest rateson a variety of corporate and consumer loans, to 8.5 percent inearly February, and analysts forecast it will remain at this levelthrough the end of the year.   _The federal budget deficit, which fell to $150.4 billion in1987, will rise to $157 billion in the current fiscal year, butthen resume falling, dropping to $140 billion by 1990. This is morepessimistic than the Reagan administration, which sees this year'sdeficit falling to $146.7 billion and a further decline to $104.2billion by 1990.   _The country's foreign trade deficit, which hit a record $171billion last year, will finally start to come down, dipping to $150billion this year and $130 billion in 1989.   The optimism on the trade deficit is based on a belief that thedollar has finally fallen far enough to stem Americans' appetitefor imports while making U.S. products competitive once again onoverseas markets.   Ms. Cooper said the economists are now less pessimistic aboutthe fate of the dollar with less than one-fifth of them thinkingthe dollar will drop by 10 percent in value this year against othermajor currencies. In November, more than 40 percent were lookingfor a decline in the dollar that was at least that large.</TEXT></DOC>
