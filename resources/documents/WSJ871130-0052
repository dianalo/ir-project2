Allowing aides to be prosecuted for nothing more criminal than the pursuit of executive-branch policies will not serve either his own interests or those of future presidents.    The Iran-Contra scapegoats are but the latest victims of the long-running campaign by Mr. Reagan's political opponents to nullify his landslide elections. The Washington elite set out to use &quot;ethics&quot; claims, distortions, special prosecutors and allegations of scandal to destroy his administration body by body -- like the Viet Cong assassinating village chiefs.    President Reagan, unfortunately, has simply severed ties with each controversial figure to avoid &quot;tainting&quot; the presidency. He has paid a heavy price. Entering his final year in office, he is politically weak and isolated from his natural allies.    Consider the Reagan casualty list. Dick Allen, the first national security adviser, resigned over a watch and $1,000 in a White House safe. EPA administrator Anne Burford fell victim to a scandal concocted by environmentalists. Thomas Reed left the White House after paying an insider-trading fine -- and was later found not guilty. Jim Beggs left NASA after a case was brought against his former employer, General Dynamics; later it was dropped as groundless. Jim Watt was pilloried over a joke. Leslie Lenkowsky fell over a USIA &quot;blacklist.&quot; The smear of Robert Bork was the ultimate outrage.    Mike Deaver and Lyn Nofziger are being prosecuted for doing the same thing that thousands of former congressmen do every day. Among the victims of palace coups were Bill Clark and Cap Weinberger, who lost out to George Shultz. Only Ed Meese is left from the original Reaganite coterie, which explains the increasingly neurotic attacks on him.    Liberals themselves have felt some backlash from the &quot;ethics&quot; campaigns they unleashed. But Joseph Biden, despite his plagiarism problem, still sat in judgment on Robert Bork. Jim Wright, despite press interest in his Houston Sandamp;L affiliations, remains speaker of the House.    As proxy for all those who have sacrificed their careers trying to carry out Mr. Reagan's policies, we now have Adm. Poindexter and Lt. Col. North. They face the ignominy and expense of spending the next years of their lives fighting off an extraordinary and in our view extralegal prosecution. The charges were aired in prime time, and the jury of public opinion acquitted them on all counts. No evidence of personal benefit that might warrant criminal prosecution has been found.    Lawrence Walsh is rumored to be preparing indictments charging &quot;conspiracy to defraud the United States.&quot; Legally, such a charge would be prima facie suspect, for it in effect means no real crimes were committed. But politically, it would do what Mr. Reagan's enemies wish, prolong the &quot;scandal&quot; through an election year.    The best legal argument in favor of the pardons comes from an unlikely source -- the majority report of the Iran-Contra committees. Far from outlaws pursuing their own policies, the report says that &quot;Members of the NSC staff appeared to believe that their actions were consistent with the President's desires. It was the President's policy -- not an isolated decision by North or Poindexter -- to sell arms secretly to Iran and to maintain the Contras 'body and soul.'&quot;    The report in effect absolves these officials of any criminal intent, repeatedly citing their good-faith belief that they and the private contractors they employed were pursuing the foreign policy of the commander in chief. &quot;North directed the Enterprise's efforts on behalf of the Contras with Poindexter's approval and in the belief that the President likewise concurred,&quot; the majority wrote.    The minority report agreed. &quot;The President clearly approved of private benefactor and third-country funding, and neither he NOR HIS DESIGNATED AGENTS could constitutionally be prohibited from encouraging it.&quot; (Italics in the original.) The minority report also expressly clears Richard Secord and Albert Hakim. It says, &quot;We think it unlikely, under the circumstances, that the funds were acquired or used with criminal intent.&quot;    A president's broad discretion in foreign policy also belongs to his agents. A pardon for pursuing the president's policies, far from being an admission of guilt, would be a proper and necessary tool for protecting the constitutional prerogatives of the executive branch.    The authors of the Constitution foresaw that Congress might try to criminalize policy differences, which is one reason they gave presidents the power to issue pardons. The pardon is one of the president's ultimate tools in the eternal battle over separation of powers -- but only if he uses it. </TEXT></DOC>
