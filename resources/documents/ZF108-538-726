 400 on Reader Service CardandM;As the ratio of VAXes to system managers increases almost by the day, thecorresponding growth in VAX system management software is helping overworkedsystem managers perform more tasks at once.andP;  Some of these sophisticatedpackages can perform long, repetitive system management tasks on severalVAXes simultaneously.andM;Auditor, written by Pip Systems Software of Cheshire, England, anddistributed in the United States by Braintree Technology, is such a package.andO;This able software lets system managers monitor and react to disk- andauthorization-related security problems.andP;  In tests at DR Labs, we found thatthe software functioned flawlessly, producing voluminous but helpful securityreports.andM;Auditor, however, is not an all-encompassing security product; for example,it cannot log out idle processes.andP;  It must be teamed up with other softwareto offer a totally secure VAX installation.andM;JUST THE FACTS, MA'AMandM;Auditor version 1.7 works with VAXes running VMS version 5.0 or later.andP;  Itexamines a VAX system to establish a baseline of security informationregarding such areas as user authorization and file protection.andP;  Futureaudits are compared with this baseline regularly, and all differences--suchas inappropriate read access to protected files--are flagged.andP;  Notificationof these changes is sent to the system manager or other designated users,such as security officers, computer operators, corporate staff or MISmanagers, via VMS Mail.andP;  The system manager then can take action against theculprit.andM;Auditor can create this baseline model and make future comparisons eitherinteractively or in batch mode during off-peak hours.andP;  Batch mode is usefulfor performing audits, such as those with extensive reporting, that mayconsume a lot of CPU and I/O resources.andM;Beyond generating models of the system, Auditor allows system managers togenerate detailed reports on individual aspects of system security and takecloser looks at specific security risks.andM;Lastly, system managers can have Auditor create DCL command procedures torectify any problems it finds.andP;  For example, Auditor will create the DCLcommand file AUDIT$REM_PRIV.COM to remove privileges from those users that itdetermines are not authorized to have them.andM;Today, there are often many VAXes at a single site.andP;  Auditor's design takesthis into account.andP;  It lets users perform audits on remote DECnet VAX nodesfrom a centralized VAX system.andM;To ensure that privileged but unauthorized users are not allowed to runAuditor, the software is password-protected.andP;  After a user enters RUN AUDITORat the DCL prompt, the screen is blanked.andP;  As a security feature, no passwordprompt appears: The user must know that a password is expected.andP;  Enteringanything but the password will cause the process to be logged out.andM;If the Auditor user leaves his or her terminal for a site-specified period oftime (two minutes by default), the screen is blanked and the user mustre-enter the password to continue.andP;  If a wrong password is entered, or iffive more minutes pass without activity, the process is logged outautomatically.andM;Before using Auditor, a system manager must edit files that define thedefaults that Auditor uses to judge a system's security: privileged accounts,minimum password length, the number of login failures allowed before thesystem manager is notified, and so on.andP;  Other important information kept inthese files includes the Auditor mode, the names of disk drives to beexamined on disk-related security checks and the VMS usernames to alert viaVMS Mail when a security violation is found.andM;Auditor has two operating modes--passive and active.andM;Passive mode allows system managers to view and generate security reports butnot to take any corrective action.andP;  Active mode allows system managers to fixany problems that Auditor finds.andM;Within active mode, there are two operation modes--indirect and direct.andP;  Inindirect mode, Auditor performs an audit and creates command procedures torectify any problems it finds, but it does not execute those procedures.andP;  Indirect mode, Auditor will perform the audit, create command procedures andexecute them.andM;Passive mode is well-suited to computer operators who are learning to monitorsystem security but who are not yet knowledgeable enough to modify a runningsystem.andM;For larger VAX sites, Auditor can be set to prevent its users from viewingand generating reports about users in other user identification code groups.andO;This option is ideal for project managers who must guarantee the security anddisk use for a given project.andM;As part of the installation process, system managers edit base files thatspecify which Auditor command procedures should be built if security problemsare uncovered in active mode.andP;  By default, Auditor will not generate anycommand procedures while in active mode; it is up to the system manager todesignate which actions Auditor should attempt once it detects potentialsecurity problems.andM;After a user invokes Auditor and enters the password, Auditor's main screenis displayed.andP;  This screen is divided into five windows.andM;On the left are two windows that give run-time statistics on Auditor's use ofsystem resources--CPU time, direct I/O counts, page-fault statistics andmore--for the last audit performed and for all audits.andP;  This helps systemmanagers identify those audits that are heavy CPU and disk users and thus arecandidates for batch processing during off-peak hours.andP;  Of course, if thereare immediate security concerns, the audit should be run as soon as possible.andM;In the center is a window containing Auditor's Main menu, which lists thetypes of audits.andP;  To the right is a window listing possible actions, whichchange according to the user's selection from the Main menu.andP;  At the bottomof the screen is a window containing Auditor messages describing the progressof various Auditor commands.andM;Before taking any other action, the system manager should run a baselineaudit as a batch job to judge the overall security of the system.andP;  Systemmanagers can set up the job using the Create Batch option on Auditor's Mainmenu.andM;Our baseline audit of DR Labs' MicroVAX 3600 took approximately 15 minutes inbatch mode.andP;  Once it was completed, we ran Auditor's report generator to turnthe audit's results into an extensive 20-page report--replete with indexpages, appendixes and explanations of all audit data.andP;  This well-writtenreport included a comprehensive description of all of Auditor's securitytests.andM;Many sections of the report are accompanied by security scores for the user'sVAX system.andP;  These scores are semi-arbitrary numbers that show the severityof the security problems in different areas.andP;  By comparing the scores onsuccessive audits, system managers can judge their progress in making thesystem secure.andM;Once the baseline model is created, system managers can instruct Auditor toperform regular comparison audits on a daily or weekly basis.andP;  Anydiscrepancies will be flagged and mailed to a predetermined list of users(Fig.andP;  1).andM;One major shortcoming we found with this release of Auditor is the lack of anoption for automatically submitting batch audits with a repeat cycle of lessthan one day.andP;  Because the DCL command procedures that Auditor creates arenot kept on disk--for security reasons--it is not easy to perform frequentaudits.andP;  Users have to submit several audits with different starting times toget around this shortcoming.andM;We mentioned this shortcoming to Brain-tree Technology, and within a week thevendor informed us that Pip had changed the product for future versions toinclude automatic submission of batch audits at more frequent intervals.andM;POLICE REPORTandM;Our Auditor report detailed the hardware identification number and CPU typeof our VAX, the version of VMS it was running and the time at which our VAXwas last booted.andP;  For each report category, Auditor provided informationabout elements of system performance, as well as explanations of theirimportance.andP;  Going a step further, the Auditor report projected possiblechanges and indicated security threats that such changes could create.andM;Our report also identified the system disk and 18 of its attributes, alongwith the status of VMS accounting and security auditing, security-relatedSYSGEN parameters and logical names such as SYS$ANNOUNCE and SYS$WELCOME,which advertise the operating system to dial-in users and should be leftblank when high security is desired.andM;The report also offers security recommendations, such as minimum passwordlengths, for standard VMS accounts such as SYSTEM, SYSTEST and DEFAULT whenthese accounts do not meet the recommended standards (Fig.andP;  2).andM;Other highlights of the report are detailed information about DECnet,privileged proxy accounts, accounts that haven't been used in a specifiednumber of days, users with a greater number of unread VMS Mail messages thanthe defined limit, automatic logins on terminal ports, users withoutdirectories, users with excessive login failures, all users with privileges,the protection and ownership of batch and print queues, and all installedprivileged images.andP;  Checking for these elements without Auditor would be atedious task for the system manager.andP;  Although one of these elements byitself might not present a security risk, a combination might indicate aserious security threat.andM;Experienced system managers do not need to run the audit output throughAuditor's report writer to analyze it, because knowledgeable users canunderstand the output in its short form.andP;  The difference between the shortform and the full report is that the full report includes explanations ofeach item to help users who don't possess specific knowledge of VMS.andM;Beyond the baseline auditing and comparison modeling it provides, Auditorallows system managers to perform security audits on definable subsets oftests from the Main menu, either interactively or via batch jobs.andP;  Main menucategories include Authorization, File Access, Access Control Lists (ACLs)and Miscellaneous security audits.andM;To perform tasks interactively, a system manager simply presses the number ofthe desired report.andP;  Auditor performs the task while displaying the status ofthe audit in the message window.andP;  When an audit is complete, the systemmanager can view it by pressing the V key.andP;  Alternatively, the system managercan print log files from one or more Auditor sessions.andM;Authorization audits are an excellent way to tighten up access to the VAX.andO;They flag accounts with privileges, accounts that have not been used in aspecified number of days and accounts that have high numbers of loginfailures--an indication that someone is trying to guess the password.andP;  Inaddition, Auditor can check for users who are using easy-to-guesspasswords--such as the account name--or who are reusing old passwords (Fig.andO;3).andM;When the system manager runs Auditor in active mode, whether direct orindirect, a window appears in the upper right part of the main screen statingthat this mode is active and displaying a list of actions to be corrected.andO;For example, in our authorization audit mentioned previously, Auditor createda command procedure to disable the accounts in question.andP;  This commandprocedure would use the /FLAGS=DISUSER qualifier in the VMS Authorize utilityto make the accounts inactive without removing them from the SYSUAF.DAT file.andM;Although the lure of automated responses to system management problems isstrong, we recommend that Auditor not be used in direct active mode unlessthe person running it is fully aware of the consequences of Auditor's commandprocedures.andP;  Users should run Auditor in indirect active mode and inspect thecommand procedures before executing them.andP;  Users who donht have a detailedknowledge of DCL should not attempt to use Auditor in direct active mode, asthe command procedures are not self-documented; they contain only thenecessary DCL code to perform their assigned tasks.andM;DR Labs' tests indicated that direct active mode worked perfectly and thecommand procedures fixed all of the problems that Auditor detected.andM;GUARD DUTYandM;Another main category of Auditor security tests deals with user access tospecific files.andP;  Auditor can generate a list of all users who have access toa specified file, as well as lists of privileges or rights that allow theseusers to access the files.andM;The Miscellaneous menu contains a number of useful tests for tightening upsecurity and system management relating to files and disk space.andP;  Usingchoices from this menu, the system manager can search a given set of disksfor files that are marked &quot;no backup,&quot; files that have not been backed up,files that are marked &quot;erase on delete,&quot; files that have multiple entries onthe disk (created with the SET FILE/ENTRY DCL command), files older than agiven number of days, and new and expired files.andM;In addition, the Miscellaneous menu allows system managers to search anentire disk for compromising strings, such as passwords in a file, and checkimages for modification.andP;  This last task is accomplished by creating adatabase of image checksums for comparison with the current checksums of theimage files.andP;  This is an excellent mechanism for determining if anyone haschanged system files or other sensitive images that should remain unchanged.andM;Lastly, the Miscellaneous menu allows auditing of disk quota use, recentlydeleted files and orphaned files--files that do not have an owner who is acurrent user or files whose identifier is missing.andM;The last major category of Auditor's reports deals with file ACLs on a givenset of disk drives.andP;  With this menu, the system manager can determine allfiles that have alarm, interactive, batch, dial-up, remote, local or networkACLs attached to them.andM;Beyond this simple task, the system manager can create an ACL database fileto serve as a baseline for comparison when Auditor runs every night.andP;  Auditorwill flag any files that have an ACE (Access Control Entry) that is not inthe database and any files whose ACEs have been removed, added or modifiedsince the last run of the comparison option.andM;Finally, the Scores option on Auditor's Examine menu provides an excellentsnapshot of the overall security integrity of a system.andP;  The Scores optiongenerates a listing of all Auditor security reports that have been run andthe system's scores on those reports.andM;One nice feature of Auditor is that it traps broadcast messages--such as &quot;NewMail on node SLUDGE from JONES&quot;--and displays them in a window so that thescreen is not disturbed.andP;  Unfortunately, Auditor does not support spawning toVMS Mail or any other application.andM;Missing from the package are simple security utilities for logging out idleprocesses (one of the biggest security threats on a VAX), monitoring terminalstreams and encrypting data.andP;  To create a more secure system, the systemmanager should use other security packages with Auditor.andP;  No such packagescome bundled with Auditor.andM;The Auditor manual is a single, spiral-bound volume.andP;  Although the manual hasmany screen shots and explanations of the various reports, it is not writtenin the familiar DEC style.andP;  The index is confusing in appearance and has anincomplete list of references as well as some references that point to thewrong pages.andP;  The manual's format may make the manual difficult for novicesystem managers to understand.andM;Braintree Technology has priced Auditor from $500 for a VAXstation to $15,000for a VAX 8974.andP;  Discounts are available for additional cluster or DECnetnodes.andM;Overall, we found Auditor to be a competent system management product thatwas able to detect a number of problems on our machine and offer remedies forthose anomalies.andM;TEST LABS MODELandM;DR Labs tested Auditor on a single MicroVAX 3600 running VMS version 5.1.andO;The system included four disk drives and approximately 50 user accounts.andM;To test Auditor's reporting capabilities, we ran the software bothinteractively and in batch mode.andP;  We modified certain values of the itemsthat Auditor monitors, like passwords, file ACLs and logical names, then rana comparison audit to verify that Auditor would flag the changes.andP;  We alsoperformed comparison audits on a nightly basis and examined the effects ofour normal users' activities on the security of our VAX system.andM;To test Auditor's direct active mode, we reconfigured Auditor and created auser who had 24 unread VMS Mail messages (four more than our designatedlimit) and 10 login failures (seven more than our designated limit).andP;  When weran Auditor, this user was immediately locked out of the system.andM;Jeffrey A.
