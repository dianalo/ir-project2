The Food and Drug Administration approved the drug, aerosolpentamidine, on Thursday. The announcement came as the Centers forDisease Control issued greatly expanded treatment guidelinesrecommending wider use of the drug in people infected with the AIDSvirus but who may show no symptoms.   Aerosol pentamidine has been widely available for several monthsto people infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV,under a special FDA pre-approval distribution program. The cost ofthe drug, however, is a burden for many.   Full FDA approval means that more insurance companies will coverat least part of the costs of the treatment, which runs about $150for a monthly dose.   Aerosol pentamidine, which is inhaled into the lungs, has beenfound to prevent pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. This form ofpneumonia kills more than 60 percent of AIDS patients.   The injectable form of pentamidine was approved in 1984 forpatients already suffering from pneumocystis. But injections offeredfar less protection than the inhalable, aerosol form.   Approval of the drug may help about 100,000 AIDS-infected peoplewho are at risk of developing initial or subsequent bouts ofpneumocystis, said Dr. Louis Sullivan, secretary of the Departmentof Health and Human Services, parent agency of both the Food andDrug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control.   Aerosol pentamidine, to by marketed by LyphoMed Inc. of Rosemont,Ill., will be labeled for use in patients who have had at least oneepisode of pneumonia or whose immune systems have deterioratedsignificantly, the FDA said.   The government estimates that between 945,000 and 1.4 millionAmericans are infected with the AIDS virus. About 120,000 people whohave been tested at public counseling and testing centers have beeninformed that they are infected. The number of people who have beenfound through other sources to be infected is not known, CDC said.   CDC recommended that people who test positive for the virus, eventhough they may have no symptoms of the disease, have criticalimmune-system cells monitored every six months. These cells arecalled CD4 helper lymphocyte cells, which in healthy people appearat counts of about 1,000 or more.   CDC also recommended that when the cell count drops below 200,patients should be started on one of two drugs that have been shownto protect against pneumocystis.   ``The guidelines are likely to increase the demand for HIVantibody testing by persons who believe they may be at risk forinfection,'' now that more can be done medically to prolong thelives of AIDS patients, CDC said. More aggressive testing andmonitoring will also raise the demand for medical services, CDC said.   The CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report did not estimatehow much health care costs would increase with increased testing,monitoring and administering of preventive drugs.   Last week, at the Fifth International AIDS conference inMontreal, Dr. James Mason, former CDC director who is now assistantsecretary for health, was quoted as saying increased monitoring ofHIV-infected people and use of AIDS drug treatments could cost $2billion to $3 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
