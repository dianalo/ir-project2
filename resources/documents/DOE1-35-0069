Exposedrats were given a single, nose-only, inhalation exposure to {sup 169}Yb-{sup239}PuO{sub 2} aerosol (AMAD, 1.6 +- 0.11 {mu}m). The effective half-timefor {sup 169}Yb in the lung was 14 days, whereas {similar_to}76% of {sup239}Pu was cleared with a half-time of 20 days and 24%, with a half-timeof 180 days. Whole-body counting for {sup 169}Yb at 14 days after exposurewas an accurate method for determining {sup 239}Pu IAD in individualrats, even at IAD's as low as 0.60 nCi of {sup 239}Pu. The {sup 239}Pulung-clearance curve and an equation describing changes in lung weightwith body weight and age were used to determine lung radiation doses.The IAD's of exposure groups were 0.60 +- 0.15 nCi of {sup 239}Pu (1000rats), 0.98 +- 0.25 (531 rats), 2.4 +- 0.69 (209 rats), 5.7 +- 1.2 (98rats), and 7.5 +- 2.0 to 150 +- 37 nCi (300 rats); corresponding radiationdoses to the lung estimated at 3 years after exposure were 8.3, 14, 33,79, and 100 to 2100 rads, respectively. 71 refs., 5 figs., 4 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
