The president and Prescott Bush of Connecticut, who visitedChina last February on business, are ``unaware of any associationinvolving Hughes aircraft,'' the contractor that is building threesatellites for launch by the Chinese, said White House spokesmanSteve Hart.   Bush is considering lifting a ban on satellite exports to China,a sanction he imposed because of Beijing's violent crackdown onpro-democracy demonstrators last spring.   Affected would be three communications satellites that are beingmanufactured by Hughes and are to be launched in joint ventures byChina.   Administration officials have said the ban on satellite exportmight be lifted because Bush meant to restrict military trade, notcommercial ventures.   The president's brother is a business consultant to AssetManagement International Financing andamp; Settlement of New York, aninternational merchant bank that arranges financing and otherservices for firms doing multinational business.   Stanley Scheinman, executive vice president of the firm, saidBush's decision on the satellite matter ``is not relevant to ourbusiness plans.''   The president's brother did not return a reporter's Wednesdaycalls to his New York office.   Scheinman said it was ``pretty far out'' to suggest that adecision to resume the satellite transfers would benefit PrescottBush or the Asset Management firm.   However, he acknowledged that ``future telecommunicationscapacity established anywhere in the world'' to technology starvedcountries like the Soviet Union and China ``would benefit anytelecommunications interest,'' such as a client Asset Management isworking with.   That company, Sino Trade, is involved in a venture with aChinese group to link data bases that are scattered all over China.   Scheinman contended the firm already has its plans for acommunications network using all existing telecommunicationsavenues, including telephone lines, microwave, and an existingsatellite. Thus, said Scheinman, Sino Trade is not concerned aboutwhether more satellites are brought in.   However, The Washington Times on Wednesday quoted an official ofSino Trade as saying that Bush's decision on the Hughes satellitescould augment Sino Trade's project although the company would notbe dependent on it.   The official, Richard Wall, told The Los Angeles Times that theHughes satellites would offer a better communications link than thedomestic one in China.   Hart said the president's brother ``has been very careful in hisdealings. ... He is cognizant of his brother's position and hasbeen, in the past, outspoken that there is no relationship in hisbusiness dealings with those of the government or the president.''   Prescott Bush traveled through Japan, South Korea and China insearch of business for his own development consulting firm lastFebruary. The president also visited those same countries later.   The president's brother said at the time he saw no conflict ofinterest and stated he has a policy against doing business with theU.S. government or lobbying the government.</TEXT></DOC>
