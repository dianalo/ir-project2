He promised to ``work day and night'' with Congress to putAmerica's fiscal house in order.   In a prime-time, nationally broadcast appearance, Bush proposedslashing $2.6 billion from the defense budget proposed by formerPresident Reagan to help offset costs of the expanded domesticprograms.   Bush, in prepared remarks to the heavily Democratic Congress,also voiced his personal support for making Puerto Rico the nation's51st state and called on Congress ``to take the necessary steps tolet the people decide in a referendum.''   And he said he would set up a new Task Force on Competitiveness,chaired by Vice President Dan Quayle. Saying, ``The most importantcompetitiveness program of all is one that improves education inAmerica,'' he traced a number of schooling initiatives.   The Bush speech was not a State of the Union address _ Reaganproduced one on paper before leaving office last month _ but itstood for one, touching upon key foreign policy issues as well asthe entire range of domestic concerns.   The president's budget plan, which features a one-year freeze onscores of federal programs, calls for roughly $5 billion morespending than the budget submitted by Reagan last month and carriesout Bush's oft-stated vow of not seeking any increase in taxes.   He said his offer to freeze Pentagon spending was conditioned onreaching an overall agreement with Congress that included budgetreforms. He proposed that the government go to a two-year budgetprocess, rather than one year, and asked like Reagan before him forthe power for a line-item veto. Bush's first presidential speechmixed campaign promises with expressions of budget restraint and newovertures toward bipartisanship.   Initial reaction from congressional leaders was cordial. ``TheDemocratic Congress wants to work with this president in every waythat we can,'' House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, said in a tapedresponse to Bush's speech that was carried on television networks.   ``We'll give him our sincere cooperation. That does not meanobedience. It does mean our honest help and our very best advice,''Wright said.   Bush reiterated a vow from his inaugural address to extend a handto Congress. ``My team and I are ready to work with the Congress, toform a special leadership group, to negotiate in good faith, to worknight and day _ if that's what it takes _ to meet the budget targetsand to produce a budget on time.''   Among Bush's major proposals were:   _ An increase in funding for the space program of $2.4 billionover the current year.   _ Indefinite postponement of three oil drilling leases ``whichhave raised troubling questions,'' two off the coast of Californiaand one in Florida ``which could threaten the Everglades.''   _ A $1,000-per child tax credit for low-income families and a$3,000 deduction to help defer the cost of adoptions.   _ The first installment toward $500 million in grants for thenation's best schools, rewards for teachers, and an expansion of theHead Start program.   ``I have said I'd like to be `the education president.' Tonight,I ask you to join me by becoming `the education Congress,''' he said.   Bush devoted the bulk of his speech to domestic issues, talkingabout the expanded programs he had promised during his presidentialcampaign.   But he also said that ``securing a more peaceful world is perhapsthe most important priority I'd like to address.''   He said it was a time of ``great change in the world,'' and whilethe United States should be encouraged by signs of reform in theSoviet Union, the Kremlin clings to ``objectives which are still toooften in conflict with ours.''   He promised to ``vigorously pursue'' development of a space-basedmissile defense shield, the so-called Star Wars concept, anddeclared that chemical weapons ``must be banned from the face of theEarth.'' He also said the United States must persevere in itssupport of anti-communist freedom fighter movements around the globe.   ``The hands remain extended, the sleeves are rolled up, Americais waiting, and we must produce. Together, we can build a betterAmerica,'' Bush said.   He noted that he had first entered the House chamber 22 yearsago, when he was sworn in as a freshman congressman from Texas.   Referring to the chairs behind him where the House speaker andthe vice president sit, Bush said, ``Eight years ago, I sat in thatchair as President Reagan spoke of punishing inflation anddevastatingly high interest rates, people out of work, Americanconfidence on the wane. Our challenge is different.''   Noting the record six-year peacetime expansion, Bush declared,``We are headed the right way. But we cannot rest.''   Bush called for a new aggressive push in fighting ``the scourgeof drug abuse,'' including a $6 billion budget to fight drugs,nearly a $1 billion increase over current spending.   ``Let this be recorded as the time when America rose up and said,`no' to drugs ... The war will be waged on all fronts.''   Borrowing a line from former Democratic presidential candidateJesse Jackson, Bush said, ``To kids in our cities _ don't give uphope. Say no to drugs. Stay in school. And yes, `keep hope alive.'''   In remarks addressed to his television audience ``watchingtonight in your living rooms,'' Bush said: ``hold fast to yourdreams, because ultimately America's future rests in your hands.''   ``And to my friends in this chamber, I ask for your cooperationto keep America growing while cutting the deficit. That is only fairto those who now have no vote _ the generations to come.''   His budget was vague on exactly where all the money would comefrom to pay for initiatives.      MORE</TEXT></DOC>
