The distribution behavior of thoriumwas apparently affected by salt composition and temperature, but thatof radium was little affected. The effect of salt composition on thedistribution behavior was well explained by considering the formationof complex compounds in the salt phase. The thermodynamical propertiesof the complex compounds were also evaluated.</TEXT></DOC>
