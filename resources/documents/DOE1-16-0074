Wesummarize the main spectroscopic properties which may be favorably comparedto that of already known efficient high average power laser materials(YAG:Nd{sup 3+}) or tunable solid-state lasers (GSGG:Cr{sup 3+}). Thepossibility of improved laser efficiency by Cr{sup 3+} {yields} Nd{sup3+} energy transfer in codoped crystals is also studied. More generally,we present the trends in this active research field.</TEXT></DOC>
