Even his death had a peculiar order about it, coming at the age of88 -- precisely equaling the number of keys on a concert grand.;    He threwhimself into performances with a gusto second to none, bounding up from thepiano bench for the mightiest chords in romantic works. His lean, wiry build-- enhanced by twinkling eyes and an irresistible, almost mischievous smile --required his throwing the whole body into a performance when maximum volumewas needed.;    Serkin, coming onstage for a recital, approached the piano onthe bias, like a lion tamer approaching a dangerous animal. He walked withshort, almost running steps to the instrument, smiling nervously and throwingquick glances at floor and ceiling as if looking for a way to escape. His eyesprotruded behind thick glasses, and with his astonished look and halo of thingray hair he could have been taken for a piano-playing Dr. Seuss.;    Althoughabove all a classicist who preferred pristine, anti-sentimental performances,he played music from Bach to Brahms, rarely venturing outside the Germanicrepertory. His seamless runs remain indelibly etched in the memory of thosewho heard him play.;    He may have performed more frequently as a guestsoloist with the San Francisco Symphony than any other touring artist, with 33engagements, spanning from 1949, under Pierre Monteux, to 1986, under HerbertBlomstedt.;    He made concerto recordings into his 80s.;    One of his BayArea high points was his rendition of Mendelssohn's Piano Concerto No. 1 forthe opening of Davies Symphony Hall in September 1980.;    Born in Eger,Austria, of Russian parents, he made his debut at the Vienna Symphony duringWorld War I. His teachers included composer Arnold Schoenberg.;    A highlyeffective and committed chamber-music performer, he helped found the MarlboroFestival and School in Vermont, whose young artists all had extensive trainingin the chamber idiom. His unwavering enthusiasm for the music that he himselfhad so often played proved infectious to his students.;    After gaining hisU.S. citizenship in 1939, he became head of the piano department of the CurtisInstitute in Philadelphia, a music school of which he eventually became thedirector.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  PAUL HERTELENDY, Mercury News Music Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910510  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  16A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  545  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday May 10, 199100131068,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
