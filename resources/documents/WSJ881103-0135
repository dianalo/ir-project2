The surcharge, known as the special assessment, has been levied since 1985 on thrifts whose deposits are insured by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. Commercial banks and savings banks whose deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. don't pay a similar fee, and thus enjoy a competitive advantage that has led FSLIC-insured thrifts to bitterly protest the assessment.    Mr. Martin made his remarks in an interview here at the annual convention of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, a thrift trade group. He said he believes the special assessment may damage healthy thrifts more than it benefits the already-insolvent FSLIC. Therefore, he said the board should consider suspending the assessment for 12 months.    Mr. Martin is likely to have trouble convincing the board's two other members to adopt his suggestion. Board member Lawrence White, in a separate interview, said he would be willing to listen to Mr. Martin's arguments, but said he believes the FSLIC &quot;really does need the cash&quot; generated by the assessment to shut failed thrifts.    Bank Board Chairman M. Danny Wall couldn't be reached for comment yesterday, but he previously has testified that the special assessment might have to be continued for as long as 30 years to pay the cost of resolving failed thrifts.    The U.S. League and other thrift groups have argued that the special assessment should be phased out starting this year, as Congress suggested last year. To keep the special assessment in place this year, the Bank Board has had to certify that the FSLIC needs the funds.    The basic premium for deposit insurance charged by both the FSLIC and the FDIC is 8.3 cents per $100 of deposits. The FSLIC special assessment is an additional 12.5 cents per $100 of deposits.    Mr. Martin's suggestion came one week after Great Western Bank, the nation's second-largest healthy thrift, filed applications to leave the FSLIC and join the FDIC. In explaining its action, Great Western, which is the main unit of Great Western Financial Corp., Beverly Hills, Calif., cited the possibility that the special assessment might continue for 30 years.    In the interview yesterday, Mr. Martin said he is convinced that the cost of closing or merging insolvent thrifts exceeds $50 billion, and that Congress and the Bank Board need to find a solution to the FSLIC crisis within the next 12 months. The Bank Board's official estimate of the size of the problem is smaller, and no formal bailout plan for the FSLIC has been proposed.    &quot;If the special assessment of $1.2 billion a year is hurting the healthy part of the industry to the point that it can't strengthen itself&quot; by boosting capital to prepare for a possible rise in interest rates or a recession, Mr. Martin said, &quot;then maybe we shouldn't charge the special assessment for the next 12 months.&quot;    &quot;When you're talking about a $50 billion hole, $1.2 billion is only about two percent,&quot; Mr. Martin said. &quot;It's a terrible thing to say, but it's not a lot of money to us.&quot;    Mr. Martin said that even with a diminished cash flow, the FSLIC could continue to issue notes to arrange FSLIC-assisted acquisitions of failed thrifts by healthy ones.    Mr. White, however, said, &quot;You really do need the cash for some transactions.&quot;    Mr. Martin also said the Bank Board would have to evaluate how a suspension of the special assessment might affect the 30-year bonds that it sells to raise funds for FSLIC. The interest payments on those bonds are financed by FSLIC premiums.    Still, Mr. Martin said, &quot;maybe for the stability of the fund and the long-term stability of the industry, we should rethink&quot; the special assessment.    On Tuesday, James Barth, the Bank Board's chief economist, said here that the special assessment reduces the average return on equity of healthy thrifts by &quot;three or four percentage points.&quot; He said that in recent years, the average return on equity for healthy thrifts has been about 12% a year.    To provide a comprehensive solution to the problems of the FSLIC, the FDIC and the Farm Credit system, Mr. Martin suggested that the federal government could impose a &quot;user fee&quot; on all types of loans made by insured institutions, amounting to two or three cents per $100 of loan amount. He suggested that the proceeds of such a fee should be paid into a trust fund to resolve problems of the three agencies.    Mr. Martin also suggested that restoring certain tax benefits for real estate controlled by the FSLIC and the FDIC would allow the agencies to unload about $88 billion of real estate with smaller losses than current market prices would indicate. The tax breaks, which allow investors to use real estate-related losses to offset all kinds of taxable income, were scrapped under the 1986 tax-overhaul law. </TEXT></DOC>
