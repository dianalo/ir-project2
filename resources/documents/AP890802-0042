To underscore an appearance of near-normalcy, President Bushpointedly refused to cancel plans Tuesday night for a barbecuedinner on the South Lawn for members of Congress, complete withcountry music.   While acknowledging ``these are not easy days,'' Bush smiled andclapped his hands to the tunes of the Oak Ridge Boys and thankedthem for bringing a ``touch of joy, touch of brightness'' to theWhite House.   The president told his guests that ``even though there arecomplicated times, I think an evening like this of just plainrelaxation with friends is very, very significant and veryimportant.''   It was a different message on Monday when a grim-faced Bush cutshort a cross-country trip and hurried back to Washington,denouncing the ``brutal murder'' of Lt. Col. William R. Higgins bykidnappers in Lebanon.   Taking a page out of Ronald Reagan's playbook, Bush summoned histop military, national security and foreign policy advisers to aWhite House meeting. That was followed by an evening briefing byBush for members of Congress.   In the Reagan White House, that kind of scenario suggested theUnited States was about to do something dramatic, such as a bombingraid on Libya or air strikes against Libyan oil platforms.   However, in this instance, military action was put on the backburner while the Bush administration pursued a diplomatic solution.An administration source said a rescue operation for the hostagesor a military strike were ``not attractive options.''   With the lives of American hostages at stake, Bush was concernedmilitary action would risk the lives of U.S. citizens in captivity,aides said.   And Bush, the author of a 1986 task force report on terrorism,knew well the danger posed by military action to innocent civilians.   ``Our principles of justice will not permit random retaliationagainst groups or countries,'' the Bush report said.   The report also acknowledged that counter-terrorism operationsare high-risk missions that ``can have a severe negative impact onU.S. prestige if they fail.''   The administration got a breather in the hostage drama Tuesdaywhen the kidnappers of American hostage Joseph Cicippio announced a48-hour extension in his threatened execution.   Administration officials said it was not certain whether theoriginal deadline provided to the news media was real or not, orwhether the reported extension means anything.   In any event, the White House clearly did not want Bush to beportrayed as a helpless captive of terrorists, dominated by theirevery move and forced to respond to their actions.   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush ``hasbeen conducting other work'' beyond the hostage matter. ``It hasnot preoccupied the government on a fulltime basis...   ``We do not want to portray a crisis atmosphere,'' he said.``But we do want to portray one of concern and one in which thegovernment shares the concern of the American people for thecitizens held hostage.''   For Bush, Secretary of State James A. Baker III, Adm. William J.Crowe Jr., chairman of the Pentagon's Joint Chiefs of Staff, aswell as Fitzwater, the hostage situation is one they have grappledwith since midway in the Reagan administration.   ``If you've been through this before,'' Fitzwater said, ``youknow you've got to plan for the long term. You can never be sure ofyour information.''   He said officials experienced in such matters ``emphasize theimportance that everyone acknowledges in taking the time to fullyascertain the facts, to give a thorough assessment of thesituation, to coordinate and diplomatically contact our allies ...''   It is basically the same process the administration _ firstReagan and now Bush _ has been pursuing for years.</TEXT><TEXT>   EDITORS _ Terence Hunt has covered the White House since 1981.</TEXT></DOC>
