Jefferson (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> LK WNEWS F.ABI </CO><IN> ARO </IN><TEXT>   Lockheed Corp. said it named Kenneth W. Cannestra, formerly general manager of the defense and electronics concern's Georgia operations, as president of its Aeronautical Systems Group.    Mr. Cannestra, 57 years old, succeeds John C. Brizendine, who becomes senior adviser to Robert A. Fuhrman, Lockheed vice chairman and chief operating officer.    Lockheed said the timing of the transition is designed to avoid a management change in the final months of competition for the Air Force's Advanced Tactical Fighter, on which the company put a potential value of $45 billion, and the start of a new program building submarine-hunting aircraft for the Navy, which potentially is valued at $5 billion.    The company, based in Calabasas, Calif., said the initial plan called for Mr. Brizendine, 63, to leave the Aeronautical Systems Group post next year.    But some industry analysts had a different explanation for the sudden management change. &quot;It seemed to me more an indication that Brizendine wasn't as highly regarded as when he was brought in there,&quot; said John N. Simon, an aerospace industry analyst at Seidler Amdec Securities Inc. in Los Angeles.    Mr. Brizendine wasn't available for comment, according to a Lockheed spokesman, who wouldn't comment on the speculation that the executive had been forced out. Mr. Brizendine, a former president of McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s Douglas Aircraft Co. unit, was named head of Lockheed's Aeronautical Systems Group in 1986.    The succession comes at a crucial time for the Aeronautical Systems Group, as its work has been overshadowed by Lockheed's fast-growing missiles and space subsidiary, maker of the Trident submarine-launched ballistic missiles, satellites and the nation's biggest Strategic Defense Initiative, or so-called Star Wars, research operation.    Lockheed is prime contractor on a team of Advanced Tactical Fighter developers that includes Boeing Co. and General Dynamics Corp. The prototype being developed by the team will compete with one produced by a Northrop Corp.-led team for the fighter contract.    Business of the Aeronautical Systems Group has been on the decline recently, as the end of production is near for C-5B military cargo planes at the huge Marietta, Ga., plant. The facility is producing wing parts for the C-17 air transport, requiring only a small part of the production capacity at the 7.8 million-square-foot plant. Speculation has been swirling over the future of the facility.    Mr. Cannestra said his goal is to find new programs or subcontracting work for the Georgia facility, with possibilities including manufacturing work and assembly of the A-320 aircraft produced by Airbus Industrie, the European aircraft consortium based in Toulouse, France. Such an arrangement, which the two companies have discussed for some time, could bring Lockheed back full force into the commercial aircraft business, which it abandoned after discontinuing production of its unprofitable L-1011 jetliner in late 1981.    &quot;We'd like to win a major job with Airbus,&quot; Mr. Cannestra said.    At the Georgia plant, H. Bard Allison, 57, formerly assistant general manager, was named to succeed Mr. Cannestra as general manager, and executive vice president of Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Co.    Lockheed also is making lots of aircraft-related changes in Southern California. It recently told employees it plans to move its Advanced Development Projects unit, known as the &quot;Skunk Works,&quot; from its Burbank plant to the desert community of Palmdale, where it also has substantial operations. The Skunk Works is widely believed to be the site where the highly classified Stealth fighter planes are being built. Lockheed said the move to the Palmdale facilities would be made over the next several years.    As previously reported, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Department of Defense recently launched investigations into claims by some workers, including those employed at the Skunk Works, that chemicals or other materials used in the facility's secret projects endanger their health. </TEXT></DOC>
