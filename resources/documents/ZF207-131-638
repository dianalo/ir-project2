(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>OVERSEAS SIGNALS MAKING MORE SENSEandM;Fresh from a string of domestic triumphs, Electronic Data Interchange isentering the international arena.andP;  Within the past six months, technologicalleaders, like General Motors Corp. and Texas Instruments Inc., began pilotprograms to demonstrate that EDI can significantly cut international businesscosts.andM;&quot;We are putting all of our eggs in the international EDI basket,&quot; statedJeffrey Sturrock, manager of EDI deployment at Texas Instruments in Plano,Texas.andM;If the pilots are successful, analysts predict the international EDI marketwill blossom more quickly and become larger than the U.S.andP;  market.andP;  &quot;Almostany large, multinational company can present a strong economic case fordeveloping international EDI applications,&quot; noted Jack Shaw, president of EDIStrategies Inc., a consulting firm in Marietta, Ga.andM;EDI is a set of data format standards that enable two companies, referred toas trading partners, to support direct computer-to-computer communications.andO;Once linked, computers exchange documents, such as purchase orders,electronically to replace manual methods of passing paper.andP;  The switch toautomation speeds the document passing process and increases accurateresponses.andM;Computer can be linked in one of two manners.andP;  Companies can build directlinks, such as low-speed private or dial-up lines, from their system to atrading partner's computer.andP;  Or, documents can be transmitted overvalue-added networks, such as Telenet, from Telenet Communications Corp.,andO;Reston, Va., and Tymnet, from McDonnell Douglas Network Systems Co., SanJose, Calif.andM;Even though EDI is a 20-year-old technology, acceptance came only during thelast few years.andP;  &quot;Companies can't implement EDI by themselves,&quot; explainedRalph W. Notto, president of EDI Inc., an EDI software company inGaithersburg, Md.andP;  &quot;They need trading partners that are also committed toEDI.&quot;andM;Trading partners were slow to implement EDI because the standards were notindustry-specific.andP;  The most common set of standards, the American NationalStandards Institute's X.12, outlined how data could be exchanged but did notdefine specific records or fields, which varied within different industries.andO;For example, the information on a purchase order for automobile parts weredifferent from the information on an order for canned peaches.andM;Within vertical markets, technology leaders gambled.andP;  Companies, like healthcare product provider Bergen Brunswig Corp., Orange, Calif., tailored X.12standards to their industry by defining a common set of records and fields.andM;This work required a substantial software investment.andP;  In many instances,companies incurred the cost even though they were not guaranteed a return.andO;Savings come only if a company can develop one EDI application and exchangeinformation with a number of partners.andP;  Most of the pilot programs involved afew partners.andM;In most cases, the risk takers were rewarded.andP;  As trading partners andcompetitors adopted the tailored standards, de facto vertical industrystandards emerged.andP;  Currently, the Ansi X.12 standards are tailored to 35different industries, according to analysts.andM;With standards in place, corporations quickly discovered that EDIdramatically improved productivity and lowered operating costs.andP;  For example,Digital Eguipment Corp. cut the cost of processing a purchase order from $125to $32 and delivery time from five weeks to three days at one manufacturingplant.andM;EDI savings have been so great that many large businesses are activelysearching out new applications.andP;  For example, General Motors now pays many ofits bills electronically.andP;  The company was so adamant about using electronicpayments that it no longer deals with banks that do not support EDIapplications.andM;Endorsements by companies like General Motors spurred a dramatic increase inEDI usage.andP;  Analysts estimate that 6,500 U.S.andP;  companies currently operateEDI applications and expect thousands more will be added during the next fewyears.andM;To date, these applications have been almost exclusively between domestictrading partners.andP;  &quot;Most EDI customers do not transmit information beyondtheir domestic borders,&quot; noted Brian Dearing, manager of EDI productmarketing at General Electric Information Services in Rockville, Md.andP;  GEInformation Services operates a valued-added network, which supports EDIapplications.andM;There are a few exceptions.andP;  For example, Texas Instruments, which has beenusing EDI since 1969, exchanges documents with trading partners in 30countries.andP;  Most of these applications tie TI to U.S.andP;  companies' foreignplants.andP;  For example, one set of applications link TI's central dataprocessing site in Plano with an IBM manufacturing plant in Edinburgh,Scotland.andM;International applications have been limited to U.S.andP;  suppliers becauseforeign companies have not readily adopted the technology.andP;  Only 1,500foreign companies run EDI applications.andP;  Most of these companies are Europeanand very few are Asian.andM;A second reason for the slowdown has been limitations with the Europeanstandard, called General Trade Document Interchange (GTDI).andP;  &quot;The GTDIstandard was a flop,&quot; claims Dearing.andP;  The standard outlined only how datacould be exchanged and forced users to define all document fields and recordsfor each application.andM;Unlike the U.S., foreign manufacturers were not willing to step forward andtailor the GTDI standard for their industries.andP;  &quot;Because U.S.andP;  manufacturerswere under tremendous pressure from offshore competition, they were morewilling to take an active role in the standards-making process than theirEuropean counterparts,&quot; Dearing said.andM;Surprisingly, U.S.andP;  manufacturers were unwilling to force foreignsubsidiaries to develop EDI applications.andP;  &quot;When a U.S.andP;  company implements anew technology, there is no assurance that its European entity will followsuit,&quot; noted Michael Gerus, project team coordinator for Automotive IndustryAction Group, an automobile industry consortium located in Detroit.andM;A number of actors are forcing corporations to overcome these roadblocks.andO;Edward Guilbert, president of Guilbert andamp; Associates Inc., a Washington, D.C.,andO;consulting firm, noted that international trade is becoming a more importantcomponent for large businesses.andP;  Standards are needed so internationaltraders can exchange information.andP;  The need for standards will become evenmore apparent in 1992 when European countries offer their wares from a commonmarket.andM;A second key is potential cost reductions.andP;  During 1988, U.S., companies sold$2 trillion worth of their products to foreigners.andP;  When shipping their goodsinternationally, a U.S.andP;  company exchanges 40 different documents a total of26 times with 20 different parties, according to EDI Strategies' Shaw.andM;He said that processing the paperwork for these shipments costs corporations$150 billion, 7% of their total revenue.andP;  &quot;Corporations can cut theiroperating costs significantly by transferring documents electronically ratherthan relying on manual methods,&quot; he explained.andM;Spurred on by the carrot of reduced cost, large companies are workingfuriously to establish international EDI standards.andP;  A United Nationscommittee began and completed work on a set of standards, called EDI ForAdministration, Commerce and Transport (Edifact), in two and a half years.andM;&quot;The standards-making process usually moves along very slowly,&quot; noted EDIStrategies' Shaw.andP;  &quot;But in the case of Edifact, the benefits were so greatthat everyone pushed the standard along quickly.&quot;andM;The U.N.andP;  approved the Edifact standards in fall of 1988 and theInternational Standards Organization has adopted them.andP;  The standards areupwardly compatible with Ansi X.12 and will eventually replace the GTDI.andM;Edifact today represents only a bare-bones implementation.andP;  The standarddefines how data can be exchanged, but little work has been completed tooutline common fields and records.andM;Pilot programs to flesh out the standard will soon begin.andP;  The mostcelebrated case, announced last fall, involves the U.S.andP;  Customs Dept., TexasInstruments, Philips North America and Occidental Petroleum Corp.andP;  Theprogram will enable the three manufacturers to automate the process ofclearing their goods through Customs Department offices in New York and SanFrancisco.andM;During the first quarter of 1989, the participants will test their firstEdifact document, the forward transportation message, which enables asupplier to track the progress of a ship carrying its goods.andP;  This documentis scheduled to be used for production applications by summer.andM;By the end of the year, participants are scheduled to begin testing two moredocuments.andP;  The dispatch device document tells a receiver which goods havebeen shipped, and the control message verifies that goods have reached theirdestination.andM;GM LINKING EUROPEAN SUPPLIERSandM;A second EDI advocate, General Motors, unveiled its plans last December.andO;This month, the company will begin linking suppliers in West Germany, Spain,Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands to the company's central European computersystem in Antwerp, Belgium.andM;General Motors plans to link 2,000 of its suppliers in eight countriesthrough Edifact by the early 1990s.andP;  That project will double the number ofEuropean companies supporting EDI.andM;The company's subsidiary, Electronic Data Systems Corp., is designing thesoftware to enable General Motors to exchange documents with its partners.andO;GE Information Services will operate the connections between the automotivetrading partners.andM;Analysts say that a European automobile manufacturers association andCaterpillar Inc. also plan pilot Edifact programs.andP;  The beehive of activityhas convinced some pundits that the international market is ready to explode.andM;Victor S. Wheatman, manager of EDI planning services at Input, a marketresearch firm in Mountain View, Calif., estimated that U.S.andP;  companies spent$6 million on international EDI in 1988 and predicted that number will growto $200 million by 1992.andP;  &quot;The world is poised and ready for Edifact,&quot; hedeclared.andM;But he tempered his optimism with possible roadblocks.andP;  For example, no oneis sure how competitively priced EDI network services and applicationsoftware will be.andP;  If they are expensive, Wheatman predicted few customerswill purchase them.andM;Antiquated laws may present another problem.andP;  Wheatman noted that outdatedlaws prohibit the transmission of information electronically in certaincountries.andP;  In Hong Kong, for example, international EDI violatesapproximately 15 statutes.andM;Hong Kong's laws illustrate one reason why Pacific Rim companies have laggedwell behind competitors in implementing EDI.andP;  &quot;We've seen very little EDIactivity or interest in the Pacific Rim,&quot; said GE Information Services'Dearing.andM;Australia adopted the X.12 standards a few years ago and has developedsuccessful EDI applications.andP;  But other countries are slow to roll out EDIapplications, and, surprisingly, Japanese companies have virtually ignoredthe technology.andM;This condition may slowly change.andP;  &quot;We don't expect the Pacific Rim companiesto continue to sit by idly as U.S.andP;  companies cut their operating costs,&quot;noted Dearing.andM;In fact, Asian companies are beginning to examine EDI.andP;  For example, theKorean government sponsored an international EDI conference in 1987.andP;  Also,software supplier EDI Inc. is working with value-added network provider DataCommunications Corp. of Korea to determine how Edifact applications may beused in that country.andM;EARLY SIGNS OF ACCEPTANCEandM;Most signals point to acceptance of Edifact but skeptics remain.andP;  &quot;It's tooearly to tell how much interest corporations will have in Edifact,&quot; claimedNotto of EDI Inc.andP;  He said that none of his customers have requested Edifactproducts.andM;The timeframe for the EDI ramp-up is even more open to debate.andP;  Aggressivecompanies, like TI and General Motors, think the benefits are near.andP;  Sturrockpredicted that by 1992 all of TI's EDI international applications will bebased on Edifact.andM;James Crouse, senior product administrator for the IBM information Network,Tampa, Fla., cautioned that only leading-edge companies are experimentingwith Edifact now.andP;  Because the standards are not perceived as stable, somecompanies have deferred commitments to the new technology.andP;  Crouse said fouryears could pass before customers are comfortable with Edifact.andM;To date, Edifact ramp-ups have moved slowly.andP;  For example, GE InformationServices introduced Edifact support in Europe during February 1988.andP;  &quot;Atfirst, the interest was disappointing,&quot; admitted Dearing.andP;  &quot;Traffic, revenueand customers have steadily increased but the numbers are still low.&quot;andM;Consultant Guilbert said, &quot;I don't expect Edifact to move like gangbusters.andO;The new has to be blended with the old, and there are 6,400 U.S.andP;  companiesalready using EDI.andP;  These companies are not going to throw out their currentapplications.andP;  I've been watching EDI evolve for 20 years.andP;  Sometimes itcrept; other times it surged.andP;  I expect Edifact to evolve in the samemanner.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
