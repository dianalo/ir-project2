Spokesman Frank Ingram said the order, issued Nov. 22 to the 110plants, noted that recent inspections ``indicate a potential safetyconcern.'' But he said there have been no instances where acounterfeit or faulty breaker was blamed for an accident of any kindat a nuclear plant.   The order for inspections, which must be carried out by March 1,followed an NRC investigation into allegations that four SouthernCalifornia firms had sold counterfeit breakers to nuclear plants.   Pacific Gas andamp; Electric reported in July that it had found 30counterfeit breakers in its inventory at the Diablo Canyon nuclearplant near San Luis Obispo.   Southern California Edison Co. found in the same month that ithad bought 16 potentially counterfeit breakers for its San Onofreplant, 55 miles south of Los Angeles.   The NRC said in the bulletin that the inspections are necessary``to provide reasonable assurance that nuclear power plants can beoperated without undue risk to the public health and safety.''   The NRC has found ``numerous failures'' of certain types ofcircuit breakers during preliminary commission-supervised tests, thebulletin said.   If a potentially counterfeit breaker is found already installed _and it cannot be immediately tested _ the utility must submit ``ananalysis justifying continued operation,'' the bulletin said.   The Los Angeles Times reported that the inspection plan wascriticized in a memorandum attached to the bulletin by UnderwritersLaboratory, a nonprofit testing agency that certifies circuitbreakers.   ``The test program is not adequate to provide assurance that thetested ... circuit breakers would be suitable for their intendedpurpose,'' the laboratory said.   The NRC responded by saying that it ``considers the test programto provide a reasonable assurance of performance requirements andcharacteristics most important to ensuring reactor safety.''   The NRC has told utilities that more than 50 companies may becounterfeiting circuit breakers and other electrical components.</TEXT></DOC>
