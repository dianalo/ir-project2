The court, without comment, left intact a 1980 law under whichfellow judges asked the House of Representatives to considerimpeaching Hastings for alleged judicial misconduct.   The justices also refused to block the release of confidentialgrand jury documents concerning Hastings to the House JudiciaryCommittee.   Hastings, who lives and works in Miami, contends the 1980 law isunconstitutional.   A federal trial jury acquitted Hastings of a bribery charge in1983 after his friend, Washington lawyer William Borders, wasconvicted in a separate trial of soliciting a $150,000 bribe inreturn for promised official favors from Hastings.   Soon after Hastings' acquittal, two federal judges in the 11thU.S. Circuit, which encompasses Florida, Georgia and Alabama, fileda complaint charging that he had obstructed justice and lied underoath during his prosecution.   An investigative panel of 11th Circuit judges compiled a381-page report that recommended Hastings be impeached. Acting onthat recommendation, the U.S. Judicial Conference in 1987 asked theHouse to consider impeachment.   The conference, a 27-judge board of directors for the federalcourts headed by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, said Hastings``has engaged in conduct which might constitute grounds forimpeachment.''   But the conference made no move to suspend Hastings fromcontinuing to preside over trials or carrying out his otherjudicial duties.   The House has not yet determined whether to impeach Hastings,who was appointed by President Jimmy Carter in 1979. If it did, hewould stand trial in the Senate.   The judges who filed the complaint against Hastings did so underthe provisions of the Judicial Councils Reform and Judicial ConductDisability Act of 1980.   Under the law, any person may file a complaint alleging that afederal judge or magistrate ``has engaged in conduct prejudicial tothe effective and expeditious administration of the business of thecourts'' or ``is unable to discharge all the duties of office byreason of mental or physical disability.''   The chief judge of a judicial circuit has the authority todismiss the complaint as frivolous or empanel an investigativecommittee of judges.   If that committee believes impeachment may be warranted, the1980 law requires it to certify that determination with theJudicial Conference, which in turn may conduct its owninvestigation and send the matter to the House.   Hastings contends that the law unconstitutionally allows judgesto usurp congressional power by taking impeachment matters beforethe House.   Hastings, the only black federal trial judge in Florida, hassuggested that the allegations against him could be raciallyinspired.   He also has said he may be the victim of a vendetta by JusticeDepartment officials angered by his rulings that blockeddeportations of Haitian refugees.   Rehnquist disqualified himself from acting on the emergencyrequest and the formal appeal from Hastings.   The cases are Hastings vs. U.S. Judicial Conference, 87-1187,and Hastings vs. House Judiciary Committee, A-788.  </TEXT></DOC>
