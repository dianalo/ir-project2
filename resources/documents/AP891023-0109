The successes in Sunday's balloting, at the cost of ChancellorHelmut Kohl's conservative Christian Democratic Union, were thelatest in a series of strong showings by the party led by formerNazi Waffen SS soldier Franz Schoenhuber.   Schoenhuber said the Republicans will make an all-out effort towin seats in the federal Parliament in Bonn in national electionsin December 1990.   ``I am convinced that the party will be represented with atleast 10 percent of the vote,'' Schoenhuber said in Munich.However, several public opinion polls have indicated theRepublicans may not reach the 5 percent hurdle needed to gain anyparliamentary seats in Bonn.   The Republicans have run on a platform of law-and-order, want toslash the number of foreign workers to combat unemployment runningat about 9 percent, and have blamed established parties for agrowing housing shortage.   Leftist protesters demonstrated Sunday night in Stuttgart andstormed city hall in Karlsruhe, where the Republicans won 6.9percent of the vote to gain about four out of the 60 city councilseats. No arrests or injuries were reported.   The Republicans already have 11 of the 138 seats in the WestBerlin legislature, as well as seats in city councils in majorcities such as Duesseldorf, Cologne and Dortmund and in parts ofHesse state.   Under West Germany's complicated election laws, the Republicansin West Berlin will send two non-voting members to the Parliamentin Bonn after the 1990 elections, based on the results in thewestern part of the divided city.   Their 7.1 percent of the vote in June gave the Republicans sixseats in the European Parliament and made them eligible for federalcampaign funds from Bonn.   An angry Mayor Manfred Rommel of Stuttgart vowed that he and hisChristian Democrats will have nothing to do with the Republicans incity hall.   ``The Republicans won't improve anything. They will just makepolitics more difficult,'' Rommel said after the polls had closed.   Officials initially had said that the Republicans' 9.6 percentof the vote would give the party five of the 60 city council seats,but late Monday said the number would be six under a complicatedapportioning system.   The Christian Democrats' share of the vote Stuttgart fell from38.8 percent to 33.1 percent, although Rommel will remain head ofthe local government.   Republican candidates did even better in other key cities inWest Germany's richest state, including 10.6 percent in Heilbronn,11.9 percent in Pforzheim and 14.2 percent in Heidenheim. The partyeven picked up a seat on the city council in the traditionalleftist stronghold of Freiburg.   It was the first time the Republicans had won seats inBaden-Wuerttemberg. The party, founded in 1983, was virtuallyunrepresented in the state's last municipal elections, held thefollowing year.   The results are expected to put further pressure on ChancellorKohl's party, which lost more than five percentage points of itsshare of the vote in Stuttgart and the state's other largest cities.   Kohl's party has been buffeted by ultra-conservatives callingfor a tougher stance to win back voters from the Republicans, whilethe left has accused the Christian Democratic Union of alreadymaking too many concessions to the far right.</TEXT></DOC>
