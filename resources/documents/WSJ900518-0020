Nippon Steel Corp., Sumitomo Metal Industries Ltd., NKKCorp. and Kawasaki Steel Corp. temporarily stopped the outputat the beginning of May, because they hadn't received anypayment since the beginning of the year. They are holdingorders for delivery between April and September of 130,000tons of pipes for drilling and shipping oil.</LP><TEXT>   Though the companies will probably continue to do businesswith Soviet organizations, they won't resume production untilpayment is guaranteed, a Nippon Steel spokesman said. This isthe first time that the Soviet Union has delayed paymentsthis long, he said. The companies have sent a group oftrading company officials to the U.S.S.R. to request aguarantee for the shipments.   Japan recently doubled the rate on export insurance forsteel shipments to the Soviet Union. Japanese trading housesalso have been notifying the government they hadn't receivedpayment for textiles and chemical products. Moscow owes asmuch as an estimated $200 million to Japanese companies. TheSoviet Union also has been delaying payment on orders toother countries, even for necessities such as grain.   After the decentralization of the Soviet economy lastyear, autonomous trading organizations sprouted nationwide,and some have been unable to secure enough currency to paytheir bills. But major Soviet procurement agencies werefaulted in the steel pipes case.</TEXT></DOC>
