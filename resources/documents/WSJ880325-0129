The groups did not oppose all standardized testing of young children.    But Ms. Bredekamp's group, along with the National Association of Early Childhood Specialists in State Departments of Education, blasted indiscriminate use of tests to hold youngsters back from kindergarten or to keep them from being promoted to later grades.    Partly because of misuse of tests, &quot;many kindergartens are now highly structured, 'watered down' first grades, emphasizing workbooks and other paper-and-pencil activities that are developmentally inappropriate for 5-year-olds,&quot; a draft of the Bredekamp group's paper said.    &quot;Our biggest objection is when tests are misused to keep children out of school. That should occur only after a complete diagnostic evaluation,&quot; Ms. Bredekamp said in an interview, adding that parents and teachers are generally more reliable than tests in gauging the readiness of children for school.    Louise Bates Ames, co-founder of the Gesell Institute, which produces a widely used screening test, said it was &quot;discouraging that these groups have taken this political position.    &quot;Our position is that if there are 25 children in a classroom, all acting at 5-year-old maturity level, the teacher still has to individualize the curriculum to different ability levels. But if you put children together at different maturity and ability levels, then you have differences you can't possibly span,&quot; she said in a telephone interview from the institute's New Haven, Conn., headquarters.    At issue are three types of tests.    &quot;Developmental screening tests&quot; like the Gesell Preschool Test are designed to assess a child's ability to acquire skills. &quot;Readiness tests&quot; help determine if preschoolers are physically and mentally mature enough to enter kindergarten. They might ask youngsters to perform such tasks as hopping, drawing straight lines or circles, and counting to 10 backward and forward.    &quot;Achievement tests&quot; are used as early as kindergarten to measure whether a child has learned enough to be promoted to the next grade, or if the youngster needs extra help or should be held back.    Many states and school districts adopted such testing after the late 1950s Sputnik era when educators decided that the very young could, and should, handle academically demanding studies.    The school reform movement of the 1980s accelerated the trend.    In 1984, Minneapolis began testing kindergartners in basic math and reading skills. Ten percent a year flunked and had to repeat kindergarten, and 75% of those were minority students.    But some, including David Elkind who wrote the best-selling &quot;The Hurried Child,&quot; criticize this &quot;get tough&quot; trend, saying elementary schools should return to less stressful curricula more appropriate to that age group.    Last September, North Carolina legislators decided to end mandatory testing of first and second graders because of concern over mounting academic pressure in those grades. </TEXT></DOC>
