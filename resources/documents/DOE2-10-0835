<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-10-0835 </DOCNO><TEXT>Higher-dimensional gravity theories based on dimensionally continued Eulerforms lead to a degenerate spectrum. It contains fewer excitations thanthe one of a generic theory with arbitrary coefficients of the higherderivative terms. This can be traced back to a residual topological invarianceof the action. The symmetry of the theory is enhanced. As a consequencethe stability group of the vacuum can be larger than in the generic case.At the four-dimensional level this can even lead to infinite dimensional(Kac-Moody type) gauge algebras. A simple six-dimensional example leadsto infinite towers of massless gravitons and scalars, but no spin-onebosons (gauge bosons) are present. We describe how modes decouple whenthe action approaches the Euler form. Concerning classical stabilitythe Euler form corresponds to a singular point in the space of six-dimensionalgravity actions.</TEXT></DOC>
