Wall Street analysts are cutting their 1990 and 1991earnings estimates for the company. Although the stock hassubsided to 31 1/8, a third below its 12-month high, mostanalysts are calling it a &quot;hold&quot; rather than a bargain.</LP><TEXT>   Their reasoning: ATandamp;T's heavy expenses in promoting itscredit card won't start paying off until at least 1992. Andrecession fears are haunting the company's phone-switch andcomputer businesses, just as ATandamp;T was beginning to winacclaim for getting its computer act together.   &quot;The economy is softening and the outlook for improvementin the near term, particularly with the Mideast crisis, isn'tgood,&quot; says Jack B. Grubman, a PaineWebber analyst. &quot;ATandamp;Tisn't immune to this, especially in its equipment business,&quot;where he estimates profits have been strained by annualpretax losses of $500 million in computers and office phonesystems.   Robert B. Morris III at Goldman, Sachs notes that themanufacturing business &quot;is nonrecurring in nature in terms ofsales, compared with ATandamp;T's long-distance business. ATandamp;T is acompany with cyclical exposure.&quot;   Joel Gross at Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette says that whenthe gross national product hummed along at 3% to 4% growth,ATandamp;T's long-distance business grew at half the industry rateof 12% to 14%. &quot;In a full recession of negative 2%, ATandamp;Tcould hit the low single digits or even flatten in terms of(revenue) growth,&quot; he says.   Larry Prendergast, ATandamp;T vice president and treasurer, begsto differ: &quot;The current view from our economists is we arenot expecting a recession in the near term,&quot; he says,&quot;although we are more concerned about it than we were severalmonths ago. . . . We have not changed our guidance of July 19that we expect 1990 to be better than '89, a record earningsyear.&quot; The executive notes that ATandamp;T trades at 11.5 timesanalysts' per-share profit estimate for 1990, &quot;in line withother companies such as MCI, IBM and GE.&quot; ATandamp;T stock hasfallen more than 20% since June, when analysts last cut theirestimates.   A companywide reorganization has cut almost 40,000 jobs intwo years, and ATandamp;T Bell Laboratories -- until now the sacredcow in cost-reduction efforts -- is expected to begindownsizing later this year. &quot;That's probably a good guess,&quot;says an ATandamp;T spokesman. &quot;But those would be a couple ofhundred non-technical, behind-the-scenes type jobs.&quot;   PaineWebber's Mr. Grubman Friday cut his full-year profitestimate for ATandamp;T to $2.50 a share from $2.60 -- flat against1989's showing. He cut his 1991 estimate to $2.70 from $2.95.   Since March, ATandamp;T's credit card operation has brokenbanking industry records, signing up nearly three millionaccounts and five million cards and racking up more than $750million in card purchases. ATandamp;T gets its cut from the feespaid by merchants on those purchases and by long-distancecallers using the card. But analysts aren't sure how muchATandamp;T has pocketed in transaction fees from the card (andcustomers who order the card this year won't ever pay anannual fee.)   Mr. Grubman estimates that ATandamp;T could be spending as muchas $100 million a quarter to push its plastic againstentrenched giants such as Citicorp and Chase Manhattan. Hesays the investment is worth it. &quot;They could have 11 millioncards by this time next year,&quot; he says. &quot;If they do and theyget a 3% return on their assets they'll earn 35 cents a shareannually from the credit card business.&quot;   Mr. Morris isn't so sure. &quot;It remains to be seen whetherATandamp;T can make money off credit cards,&quot; he says. &quot;Returns inthe industry have traditionally been high, but ATandamp;T's comingin will likely drive industry returns down.&quot; Mr. Morris isleaving his 1990 estimate for ATandamp;T at $2.60 -- already one ofthe Street's lowest -- but he cut his '91 prediction to $2.80from $3.   Analysts are cautious about the long-distance industry'sprospects. ATandamp;T derives between 50% and 55% of its revenueand 85% of its profit from long distance. Many analysts cuttheir estimates for MCI Communications a few weeks ago. Theyworry that the long-distance marketing wars are driving upselling costs.   ATandamp;T could match the spending of its long-distance foeseasily, but that wouldn't erase its immediate problems. SaysMr. Grubman: &quot;Long term, ATandamp;T has a very powerful base and isa good investment. But near term, with all the economicproblems, its stock is going to move more sideways than up.ATandamp;T's performance will mirror the market's.&quot;   One of ATandamp;T's biggest shareholders is the University ofCalifornia, which holds about 6.2 million shares and believesATandamp;T can produce annual earnings growth of about 11% a yearover the long term. ATandamp;T's 4.2% dividend yield exceeds theoverall stock market's and provides &quot;some dividend support&quot;for ATandamp;T shares, says Patricia Small, associate treasurer ofthe university system, which manages about $16 billion ofpension and endowment funds. &quot;The major question is whetherits growth rate will continue through all kinds of economiccycles . . . We don't live and die with quarterly earningsestimates.&quot;   ---   ATandamp;T   (NYSE; Symbol: T)                                                                                                          Business: Telecommunications, computers and financialservices                                                                                                          Year ended Dec. 31, 1989:*   Revenues: $36.11 billion   Net income: $2.70 billion; $2.50 a share                                                                                                          Second quarter, June 30, 1990:**   Per-share earnings: 60 cents vs. 65 cents                                                                                                          Average daily trading volume:   1,922,958 shares                                                                                                          Common shares outstanding: 1.09 billion                                                                                                          *Includes results of Eaton Financial Corp. and ParadyneCorp., acquired on March 16 and Feb. 8, 1989, respectively.   **Includes operations of ISTEL Group Ltd. since Nov. 1,1989 and two divisions of unit of PacifiCorp FinancialServices Inc. since Feb. 1, 1990</TEXT></DOC>
