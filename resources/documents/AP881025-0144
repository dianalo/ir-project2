The National Association of Realtors said sales of existing homesdeclined to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.63 million unitslast month, following a 2.2 percent increase in August.   But last month's level was still higher than most economistswould have predicted this spring, when mortgage interest rates beganto creep higher.   Fixed-rate mortgages on average hit a low of 9.84 percent inFebruary and rose to 10.71 percent by early August. Since then, theyhave eased back to 10.28 percent, but many analysts expect them tostart rising again by year's end.   Existing-home sales in the late spring and early summer werestrong, in part because many buyers apparently purchased homessooner than planned in an attempt to beat rising interest rates.   ``The decline ... in September is a hangover from the buyingspree of the summer,'' said John A. Tuccillo, chief economist of theRealtors. ``The extraordinary increase'' of the summer was ``in partborrowed from September.''   Tuccillo predicted sales rates will continue to lag in the fourthquarter and by year's end would total 3.47 million units, down onlyslightly from 3.53 million in 1987.   The West was the only region of the nation showing an increase ofsales last month. They rose 6.0 percent to an annual rate of 710,000units, the highest level since December 1986, following a 3.1percent increase in August.   Sales fell 5.8 percent in the Northeast to 650,000 units on anannual basis, the lowest since January. They fell 3.2 percent in theMidwest to 900,000 units and were off 2.8 percent in the South to1.38 million units.   John Savacool, an economist with The Wefa Group, a forecastingfirm in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., said California's strong economy andgrowing population are supporting the housing market.   ``People have been moving into California in droves, and thatprovides a lot of support for the housing market there even thoughthe rest of the nation looks weak,'' Savacool said. He noted that400,000 people moved to California last year, more than to any otherstate.   The main reason for sluggish sales in the Northeast is highprices, he said.   Over the past year, existing-home prices have risen most steeplyin the West. The median was $124,300 in September, up 7.1 percent.   However, the Northeast remained the most costly area with amedian of $141,400, up 6.3 percent from a year earlier.   The median in the South was $82,400, up 3.6 percent fromSeptember 1987. In the Midwest, the price was $67,100, up 1.5percent. The national appreciation rate over 12 months was 3.5percent to a median of $88,500, meaning half of the homes sold formore and half for less.</TEXT></DOC>
