The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which rescued FirstRepublicBank with a $1 billion loan in March, said Wednesday it wasconsidering all options to resolve the company's financial crisis.An announcement could come Friday.   Management of First RepublicBank, which had a net loss of $2.3billion in the first six months of the year, is competing withthree outside bidders for control of the institution.   But the FDIC could declare the company insolvent and run theinstitution itself until a suitor is selected in a so-calledbridge-bank transaction.   The FDIC received final proposals to buy First RepublicBank onMonday from Citicorp of New York; NCNB Corp., a regional bankingcompany based in Charlotte, N.C.; and San Francisco-based WellsFargo andamp; Co.   First RepublicBank's management, led by Chairman Albert Casey,submitted a plan to the FDIC to remain independent.   In a memo to First RepublicBank managers Wednesday, the companysaid it expected an FDIC decision by the weekend. Spokesman JoeBowles said the memo was prompted by speculation that a bridgetransaction was imminent.   ``As the decision time grows near, we expect to see more of thisspeculation,'' Bowles said.   The FDIC would ultimately shoulder close to $2 billion of thecost of any deal, FDIC Chairman Wiliam Seidman has said, includingan initial recapitalization of as much as $5 billion.   Creation of a bridge bank would eliminate bondholder andshareholder claims and nullify all current lawsuits against FirstRepublicBank. The FDIC can control the bridge bank for up to twoyears.</TEXT></DOC>
