 But chances are pretty goodthere is a Macintosh just around the corner from you.andP;  Prior to 1987, only33% of the Macs sold were for business use.andP;  Now over 60% of Macintosh salesare to businesses.andP;  You or a coworker may use a Macintosh soon.andM;Exchanging data is a snap for people who use the same type of machine.andP;  Buthow do you share files among Macs and DOS-based PCs?andP;  You can choose from arich selection of hardware, software, and network solutions.andP;  This articlepresents several popular options.andM;The right solution depends on whether you are bringing files from the Mac tothe PC or vice versa, how often you need to exchange data, how far apart theMacintosh and the DOS machine are physically located, and whether thecomputers are on a common network.andP;  Another major factor is which programcreated the file and in which program on the other computer you plan to useit.andM;Consider the example of sharing spreadsheet data with a department that usesMacintosh computers.andP;  You consolidate the corporate budget with 1-2-3 on aDOS-based PC, but your company's graphics department works up its budget on aMacintosh IIx using Microsoft's Excel 2.2.andP;  The challenge is to get thegraphics department's data into your corporate worksheet.andM;Transfer and TranslateandM;In general, exchanging data between a Mac and a PC involves two steps:transfer and translation.andM;Transferring a file means moving it from one computer to another.andP;  Thissimply allows one computer to gain physical access to files created on adifferent computer.andP;  But the transferred data may not be usable on the othersystem.andP;  Usually, you must also translate the file into a format that theappropriate program on the other system can read.andM;In some cases, your software provides all of the necessary tools fortranslation.andP;  Many Macintosh programs let you save files in popular DOSformats in addition to their own formats.andP;  Conversely, a few PC programs letyou save files in popular Macintosh formats.andP;  Saving a copy of your file in aformat that the other program can read is often the easiest way to translatedata.andM;Like most Macintosh spreadsheet programs, Excel supports the alternative ofsaving (and retrieving) files in 1-2-3's WK1 format.andP;  So, in our example youask the graphics department to use Excel's Save As...andP;  command to make a1-2-3-compatible copy.andP;  Once you transfer the data to a disk that your PC canaccess, you can retrieve or combine the file as you would any 1-2-3spreadsheet.andM;The easiest of all files to swap are likely to be the ones from programs thathave both PC and Macintosh versions.andP;  These often have built-in translationcapabilities that automatically compensate for differences between the twoversions.andM;You may find situations where you need a dedicated translation program,particularly if you plan to export data to a less popular program whoseformat is not supported by other software.andP;  You also may find that athird-party translation program performs a more accurate conversation thatthe translation features built into your software.andM;Transfer TechniquesandM;Transferring data between a Mac and a PC is similar to copying data from afloppy disk to a hard disk.andP;  You're not changing the data, you're just makingit available at a new location.andP;  There are three different ways to do this.andO;You can use serial connections, compatible floppy-disk drives, or a commonnetwork.andP;  The best solution depends on price, convenience, and your workenvironment.andM;The Serial Approach.andP;  The serial approach is the slowest, but it is often theleast expensive.andP;  Serial connections are convenient if the Macintosh and PCare near each other and if you need to transfer files only occasionally.andP;  Italso has the advantage of working the same way whether you transfer data froma Mac to a PC or vice versa.andP;  Another advantage is that all Macintoshes andvirtually all IBM-compatible PCs are equipped with a serial port.andM;One way you can implement a serial connection is to use an inexpensivenull-modem cable, which is available at most computer stores.andP;  The cable&quot;tricks&quot; the two computers into acting as if they were attached via modemsand a phone line so that you can use your favorite Mac and PC communicationsprograms.andP;  Just select the same baud rate, parity, and stop-bits settings onboth systems, and specify an upload/download method that is supported by bothof the communications packages.andM;Of course, if you have modems on each computer, you can have one machine callthe other and perform the transfer over phone lines.andP;  But you can transfer afile much faster with a null-modem connection.andM;The simplest way to implement a serial connection is to use a tumkey,out-of-the-box product such as MacLink Plus PC from DataViz (Trumbull, Conn.)andO;or LapLink Mac III from Traveling Software (Bothell, Wash.).andP;  Older versionsof both products were mentioned in &quot;Putting Apple and IBM in Touch,&quot; March1989, page 15.andP;  Both products provide the null-modem cable and communicationssoftware you need.andP;  In addition, these products include translationsoftware--essential if you need to massage your source file before thedestination program can read it.andM;The Disk-Drive Approach.andP;  One very straightforward method of swapping filesbetween Macintosh and PCs is via a floppy disk.andP;  The disk-drive approach isideal if, for example, you need to shuttle data between a Mac at home and aPC in the office.andP;  Depending on how your computers are configured, you mayalready have all of the necessary tools.andP;  If you don't, you can choose from anumber of upgrade options.andM;Wouldn't it be convenient if you could get the graphics department'sworksheet on a Macintosh 3-1/2-inch floppy disk, insert the disk into a3-1/2-inch floppy-disk drive on your PC, and then use 1-2-3 to retrieve thefile from the floppy disk?andP;  You couuld even save the updated spreadsheetdirectly to the Macintosh disk.andM;Is it that easy?andP;  Yes and no, depending on the hardware and softwareinvolved.andM;If your PC has a 3-1/2-inch disk drive, disk swapping may appear deceptivelysimple.andP;  IBM-compatible PCs and Macintoshes use the same 3-1/2-inch disk,either double-sided double-density (DS/DD) or high-density disks.andP;  Althoughthe disks are the same, the systems format and use the disks in differentways.andP;  Without the use of special techniques, neither the Mac nor the PC willrecognize the files on a disk that was formatted by the other machine.andO;Fortunately, there are several easy ways over this hurdle.andM;First, let's look at some options that allow the Mac to work with PC disks.andO;With the exception of the Macintosh Plus, all new Macintoshes now include theApple Computer's FDHD SuperDrive, which is an internal drive.andP;  FDHD standsfor &quot;floppy disk, high density.&quot;andP;  This drive, with software assistance fromApple File Exchange or DOS Mounter, can read and write DOS-formatted disks,as well as Macintosh disks.andP;  Apple provides minimal documentation with theFDHD, and thus a lot of people who have one don't know how to make optimaluse of it.andM;The Mac drive that preceded the FDHD formats (&quot;initializes,&quot; in Mac parlance)DS/DD disks, accommodating 800K of storage.andP;  That drive also supports the400K, single-sided format of the earliest Macs, but it cannot reliably usehigh-density disks.andP;  The SuperDrive lets you initialize DS/DD disks in either400K or 800K format, but it assigns a capacity of 1.44 megabytes to anyhigh-density disk that it initializes.andM;Despite the fact that the FDHD promises compatibility with DOS or OS/2Release 1.1 disks, when you insert a PC disk (720K or 1.44-megabyte format),the Mac usually asks if you want to reinitialize it!andP;  Unless you want to loseall of the data on the disk and convert it to a blank Mac disk, choose Eject.andO;The FDHD can, however, work with PC disks when you run Apple File Exchange.andO;This program, which is provided free with the Mac's system software, helpsyou translate among a number of formats and lets you transfer files among anydisks, DOS-formatted or otherwise, that your Mac can accessandM;DOS Mounter is a driver (also known as an INIT in Macintosh terminology) fromDayna Communications (Salt Lake City) that gives you direct access to a3-1/2-inch PC disk inserted into the FDHD drive, even if you're not runningApple File Exchange.andP;  DOS Mounter is painless to install and easy to use, butit is slow.andP;  If only because it prevents accidental reinitialization of DOSdisks, however, it is a must for any FDHD owner.andM;Another option from the same vendor is DaynaFile.andP;  You can purchase DaynaFilein a variety of single-drive or two-drive configurations.andP;  For example, youcan get a DaynaFile that will accommodate both 3-1/2-inch and 5-1/4-inchfloppy disks.andP;  You can choose either of the popular 5-1/4-inch formats: 360Kor 1.2 megabyte.andP;  DaynaFile attaches to the Mac's small computer systeminterface (SCSI) port, and its software is similar to DOS Mounter.andP;  Witheither product, any PC disk that you insert appears as an icon on the Mac,allowing you to perform standard Macintosh filing options.andM;Apple Computer sells a unit called the PC 5.25 Drive, for the Macintosh SEand Macintosh II families.andP;  This drive works with Apple File Exchange, justas the FDHD does.andP;  To use this drive, you must install a disk-controller cardin a slot in the Mac.andP;  Unlike Daynafile, this drive supports only 360K floppydisks.andM;Rapport from Kennect Technology (Los Gatos, Calif.) supports two differentfloppy-disk compatibility options.andP;  You plug the Rapport unit into the Mac'sexternal floppy-disk port.andP;  If you then attach an Apple 800K Mac drive toRapport, it can read and write 720K PC disks.andP;  If you use Rapport withKennect's 2.4-megabyte Mac drive, it will also support the 1.44-megabyte DOSformat.andM;Turbo Floppy from Peripheral Land (Fremont, Calif.), a 3-1/2-inch drivecompatible with all Macs, is yet another alternative.andP;  Turbo Floppy can readand write to 720K and 1.44-megabyte PC disks and 1.44-megabyte Mac disks.andM;You may prefer a solution that lets your PC use disks that you receive in Macformat.andP;  If so, you have two options to choose from.andM;Copy II PC Deluxe Option Board, from Central Point Software (Beaverton,Oreg.), enables you to read and write Mac floppy disks directly from astandard 3-1/2-inch PC floppy-disk drive.andP;  It is compatible with the IBM PS/2models 25 and 30 and with PC AT compatibles that have an internal 3-1/2-inchdisk drive.andP;  Software provided with the board controls data transfer usingDOS-like commands.andM;The other choice is Match Maker from MicroSolutions (DeKalb, Ill.).andP;  Like theCopy II PC Board, Match Maker contains an add-on card, as well as softwarefor the DOS machine.andP;  Rather than using a PC drive, however, Match Makerrequires you to attach a standard Macintosh 3-1/2-inch disk drive to theboard.andM;The disk-drive method of file transfer is faster than a serial transfer.andO;Unless you already have the appropriate hardware, such as an FDHD, you'llalso find it somewhat more expensive than the serial solution.andP;  Once you haveset up a compatible disk drive, however, it will be much simpler to use itthan to move equipment and plug in cables for impromptu serial connections.andM;The Network Approach.andP;  If you need to transfer files on a regular basis,especially between computers in an office setting, the network approach maybe the best solution.andP;  this method is, of course, particularly advantageousif your PCs and Macintoshes are already attached to a network.andM;Network options fall into two classes: PC-based or Macintosh-based.andP;  We'llfocus on Macintosh-oriented solutions because Mac-based networks are easierto set up, and because you may be less familiar with the options.andP;  However,keep in mind that for work groups that use PCs predominantly, PC-basednetworks are generally best.andP;  Three leading PC-network vendors, Novell(Provo, Utah), 3-Com Corp. (Santa Clara, Calif.), and Banyan Systems(Westborough, Mass.), offer products that allow Macs to connect and sharefiles.andP;  And Dayna Communications recently announced DaynaNet, a specialversion of Novell's NetWare that is tailored to the Mac environment.andM;Macintosh computers use a network system called AppleTalk.andP;  Every Macintoshhas built-in AppleTalk hardware, which doubles as the printer port.andP;  As aresult, anywhere two or more Macs are gathered, you will quite likely find anetwork.andP;  AppleTalk networks are very easy to install, and because they areoften used for simple printer sharing and occasional file transfers, they donot necessarily use a dedicated file server.andP;  If you need faster performancethan the Mac's built-in AppleTalk hardware provides, you can add an EtherNetcard, available from a number of suppliers.andM;Several add-in boards let you attach a PC to a Mac-based network: Apple'sLocalTalk PC Card, TOPS's FlashCard (from TOPS, Alameda, Calif.), and certainmodels of 3-Com's EtherLink card.andP;  Cabling options include Apple's AppleTalk,PhoneNet from Farallon Computing (Berkeley, Calif.), and theindustry-standard Ethernet.andP;  If your company has both PC- and Mac-basednetworks, you can link them with a gateway, such as FastPath from Novell'sKinetics.andP;  And if you use a TOPS network, you can gain access via a remotePC--even a laptop--and DOS Dial-In software from Shiva Corp. (Cambridge,Mass.).andP;  DOS Dial-In works in conjunction with certain communicationshardware that is on the network, such as a Shiva NetModem.andM;The leaders in Macintosh network software are TOPS and Apple's AppleShare.andO;Both provide tools that let PCs actively participate in the network.andM;AppleShare requires a dedicated machine to operate as server, but anycomputer running TOPS can operate as both a server and a client.andP;  With bothTOPS and AppleShare, PC and Mac users can share the same disk drives--andeven the same files.andP;  If you use a PC, you'll see the disk as a typical DOSdrive.andP;  If you use a Mac, it will look like a Mac Drive.andP;  These systemsvirtually eliminate the issue of file transfer.andP;  All you need to know is howto navigate among the disks on the network.andM;Translation TechniquesandM;As noted earlier, you may have to translate a file that you transfer.andP;  Forexample, sharing files between the Macintosh version of Microsoft Word andthe PC version of WordPerfect requires translation.andM;Apple File Exchange helps you translate a variety of popular PC and Mac fileformats.andP;  When you use the program for file transfers, you can performtranslations at the same time.andP;  Even if you transfer your files via anothermethod, you can still use Apple File Exchange to convert files.andP;  Someprograms, such as Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, provide additionaltranslators that work with Apple File Exchange.andM;If the translators provided with Apple File Exchange don't fulfill yourneeds, you can turn to MacLink Plus PC or LapLink Mac III.andP;  both weredescribed in the earlier discussion about serial transfers.andP;  But regardlessof whether you need the serial-connectivity options these programs provide,you may prize them for their libraries of software-translating tools.andO;DataViz markets a special version called MacLinkPlus/Translators thatincludes just the trnaslators, not the cables or the file-exchange software,and it retails for slightly less than MacLink Plus PC.andM;The major difference between these products is that MacLink Plus PC controlsthe file transfer from the Mac, whereas LapLink Mac III allows you to controlit from either the Mac or the PC.andP;  Both products provide translation betweenmany different file formats and are designed to accommodate new filetranslators in the future.andM;TOPS includes MacLinkPlus/TOPS Translators.andP;  If you have a current edition ofTOPS, you probably have all the translators you'll need.andM;Other Solutions:andM;Clones and DronesandM;In addition to the various ways to share files, there are two other types ofsolutions: Make your Macintosh think it's a PC or let one computer controlthe other.andM;Mac286, originally developed by AST Research and now marketed by Orange Micro(Anaheim, Calif.), is a hardware product based on an 80286 microprocessor.andO;Mac286 lets you run DOS software in a Mac window while running Macapplications in other windows.andP;  Mac86 is a similar product, geared to the8086 technology found in PC XT--class machines.andP;  The price of these productsis fairly steep--about the same price as a comparable PC--but they offer theconvenience of having all of the functionality of both computers in a singlemachine.andM;SoftPC, from Insignia Solutions (San Francisco), is another innovativeproduct.andP;  Unlike Mac286 and Mac86, it contains no hardware.andP;  Using softwarealone, SoftPC faithfully emulates an IBM PC XT.andP;  It even mimics the XT'sgrind-and-beep startup sound.andM;These clone products are technically impressive, but you may well find thatserial, disk-based, or network-based solutions are more practical andcost-effective.andM;Keep in mind that these emulation products can access a maximum of 640K of PCmemory, no matter how much memory your Macintosh has.andP;  You can, therefore,use the current versions of these PC emulators to run 1-2-3 Release 2.01 or2.2, but not Release 3.andM;Two other products, pcMacTerm II from Dynamic Microprocessor Associates (NewYork) and MacChuck from Vano Associates (New Brighton, Minn.), allow aMacintosh to control a PC.andP;  A Macintosh window containing an image of the PCscreen is displayed, and commands you enter on the Macintosh are executed onthe PC and echoed back to the Mac screen.andP;  This technology can be handy forpeople who use Macs but once in a while need to access data or applicationsthat reside on a PC.andP;  Both programs work over serial-cale or networkconnections.andP;  In addition, pcMacTerm II works via a modem.andM;Brian DeLacey works at Lotus Development Corp. in the Macintosh ProductsGroup.andP;  He is a past executive director of the Boston Computer SocietyMacintosh User Group.andM;TIPS FOR NAMING FILESandM;If you save a copy of a PC or a Macintosh file in another programhs format,make sure that you give the new file a distincuve name.andP;  When you use aforeign format, some subtleties such as text styles, and some advancedfeatures, such as macros, stand a chance of being lost.andP;  So, you'll want tokeep your orginal file intact.andM;Also, when you translate a Macintosh file to a PC format, use a DOS-like filename.andP;  A Macintosh file name can have up to 31 characters, out DOS can'thandle a name longer than 8 characters plus a period followed by a3-character extension.andP;  Choose an extension appropriate to the file type,such as .WK1 for a 1-2-3 Release 2.01 or 2.2 worksheet file or .PRN for anASCII text file.andM;Macintosh users ordinarily do not use file extensions, but extensions can behandy when differentiating between copies of the same file that have beenstored in various formats.andP;  Note that while a Macintosh file name may includespaces and almost any special characters except a colon, DOS won't acceptfile names the use spaces.andP;  And the repertoire of special characters DOS canhandle is more limited.andM;SPREADSHEET TRANSFER AND TRANSLATIONandM;There are few things you should consider before you translate spreadsheetfiles.andM;For one thing, changes in file formats take a while to find their way intotranslation utilities.andP;  You have no guarantee that a translation utility willread files formatted for Microsoft Word version 4.0 just because it readsfiles formatted for version 3.02.andP;  For instance, most of today's translationutilities can read WK1 files but are unable to read 1-2-3 Release 3's WK3files.andP;  Because Release 3 supports WK1 files, this is usually not a problem.andM;Macros do not, in general, translate between 1-2-3 and the Mac productsExcel, Wingz, or Full Impact.andP;  The PC-based Microsoft Excel for Windowsincludes the Macro Translation Assistant, which translates some--but notall--1-2-3 macros.andP;  Macintosh Excel has no such utility.andP;  Nor is there anybuilt-in utility that helps you translate Excel macros to 1-2-3.andP;  Macros areusually a lost cause when translating spreadsheet files.andM;Spreadsheet graphs do not translate well, if at all, between 1-2-3 and thevarious Macintosh spreadsheets.andM;Functions--@ functions in 1-2-3 parlance--may differ in subtle ways invarious spreadsheet programs.andP;  For example, 1-2-3 and Excel use slightlydifferent arguments in most financial functions.andP;  So be sure to check yourformulas after you go through the translation process.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
