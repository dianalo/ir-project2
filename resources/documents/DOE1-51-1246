An image immediately afterexercise, and serial delayed images after 120 and 240 min were acquired.Additional images were acquired 30, 60 and 180 min after exercise in14 pts. Regions of interest in the polar maps corresponding to normalor possible ischemic myocardium on the basis of CAG findings were selectedand their average counts (Ct) over 72 +- 32 areas were plotted againstacquisition time. Obtained time-activity curve represented upper concaveddecline and slow Tl washout in ischemic lesions. From these observation,two parameters were calculated;1) %decay (%D) = average change of Tl-201uptake between the immediate and 120 min, and 2) Decay Ratio (DR) = (Ct/sub0min/ - Ct/sub 120min/)/(Ct/sub 120min/ - Ct/sub 240min/). %D in 43 normalsegments, which were acquired 6 or 4 times, was significantly differentfrom that in 25 ischemic segments (-12.7 +- 6.2 % vs. -3.4 +- 3.2 %,p andless; 0.001). DR were 1.57 +- 0.68 in 86 normal segments and 0.40 +- 0.42in 45 ischemic segments (significantly different, p andless; 0.001). In contrastto diagnostic sensitivity 57.8 % and specificity 95.3 % of washout ratio,combination of these parameters distinguished normal from ischemic segmentswith specificity 93.0 % and sensitivity 92.3 %. Analysis of the regionaldecline curve of Tl activity using polar map was valuable in detectionof the diseased coronary segments especially in pts with multivesseldisease.</TEXT></DOC>
