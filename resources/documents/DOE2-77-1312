The potential for isoprene to cause developmental toxicity wasassessed in rodents, by exposing four groups each of Sprague-Dawley ratsand Swiss (CD-1) mice to 0, 280, 1400, or 7000 ppM isoprene vapors, 6h/day, 7 day/wk. Each treatment group consisted of 10 virgin females(for comparison), and {approx}30 positively mated rats or mice. Positivelymated mice were exposed on days 6-17 of gestation (dg), and rats on 6-19dg. The day of plug or sperm detection was designated as 0 dg. Body weightswere obtained throughout the study period, and uterine and fetal bodyweights were obtained at sacrifice (rats, 20 dg; mice, 18 dg). Implantswere enumerated and their status recorded. Live fetuses were sexed andexamined for gross, visceral, skeletal, and soft-tissue craniofacialdefects. 31 refs., 6 figs., 19 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
