Including a special gain of $126 million, second-quarter net income was $175.8 million, up from $48.8 million in the year-earlier quarter. Sales increased 17% to $1.32 billion from $1.13 billion.    But per-share net income more than quadrupled, to $2.14, including $1.53 from the special gain. The year-earlier quarter's per-share figure was 50 cents. The increase in per-share net also reflects the company's buyback since November of about 17% of the 96 million common shares outstanding at that time.    The food products concern said its onetime gain came from restructuring moves that involved the sale of a 50% stake in CPC's subsidiaries in six Asian countries to Ajinomoto Co. of Japan.    For the first half, net income jumped to $218.5 million, including the gain, from $86.7 million a year earlier. Per-share earnings for the half were $2.66, compared with 89 cents in the year-ago period. Sales increased 15% to $2.52 billion from $2.19 billion.    James R. Eiszner, chairman and president of CPC, said that although 1987 is &quot;shaping up as a very good year&quot; for the company, &quot;we may not maintain the earnings growth rate of the first half in the second.&quot;    CPC said that it expects to sell its European corn-milling business by Sept. 30, and that the sale is under negotiation. The anticipated sale reflects the company's increased emphasis on domestic business and on its grocery products.    After the sale of the corn mills, CPC's grocery products will account for 80% of its revenue, compared with about 67% currently.    CPC shares closed Friday at $55.50, unchanged, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. </TEXT></DOC>
