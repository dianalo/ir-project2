Garcia</HL><DD> 02/04/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)STOCK INDEXES (NDX) </IN><TEXT>   Stock prices ended mixed in active trading yesterday as technology and airline issues posted impressive gains.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 10.97 points to 2168.45. The industrial average opened with a surge, gaining more than 13 points in the first few minutes of trading. But the gains faded quickly. Some sell programs, linked to stock-index futures, and profit-taking knocked prices down in midafternoon.    Some of the broader market indexes sank late in the day, although advancing issues on the New York Stock Exchange outnumbered decliners, 880-718. Trading was active, as more than 198 million shares changed hands on the Big Board, a rise from 177.4 million Monday.    Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index fell 0.46 to 275.99, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index eased 0.17 to 157.28.    The weakness in the industrial average came from a handful of issues that dropped a point or more. They included American Express, Du Pont, Eastman Kodak, General Motors, Merck, Minnesota Mining andamp; Manufacturing and Westinghouse Electric.    &quot;I don't consider (yesterday) to be an unsuccessful day,&quot; said Larry Wachtel, a market strategist with Prudential-Bache Securities in New York. Although some blue-chip issues did poorly, &quot;The rest of the market did respectably well,&quot; he added.    Smaller-capitalization stocks also advanced yesterday. In the over-the-counter market, the Nasdaq OTC composite rose 2.20 to 399.38 as volume expanded to 172.1 million shares from 149.1 million Monday. There were 1,271 issues advancing and 945 declining.    The American Stock Exchange's Market Value index rose 1.41 to a record 305.56, with 334 issues advancing and 249 declining.    While institutional investors are no longer desperate to put money to work in stocks as they were in early January, &quot;This market still has legs,&quot; said Martin Krouner, head of listed trading at Jefferies andamp; Co. in New York.    Traders said many investors, anticipating better earnings and possibly stronger economic growth later this year, are still buying cyclical issues such as technology, paper, forest products, transportation and some industrial stocks. Issues sensitive to interest rates, such as banks, thrifts, utilities and insurance stocks, have lost some of their snap.    Two reports released by the Commerce Department showed signs of economic strength. But economists wonder if much of the December gains might have resulted only from the rush to beat federal tax changes that became effective Jan. 1.    The Dow Jones Transportation Average rose 9.94 to 891.84. Among the gainers in this group were Delta Air Lines, up 1 3/8 to 58 1/8; UAL, up 1/2 to 53 3/4; NWA, up 1/2 to 64 7/8; CSX, up 1 1/4 to 34 1/4; Burlington Northern, up 7/8 to 62 1/4; and Federal Express, up 7/8 to 63 7/8. Some analysts are predicting that renewed fare wars in the airline industry will likely induce sufficient additional travel to more than offset the fare cuts.    The index of leading economic indicators rose 2.1% in December, its fourth consecutive gain and the biggest increase in almost four years. Single-family home sales jumped 12.7%, helping to make 1986 the best year for the housing industry since 1978.    Semiconductor stocks were among yesterday's star performers. The stocks were still riding the wave of buying that began last Friday following news of Intel's bullish outlook for 1987 sales.    Texas Instruments jumped 5 5/8 to 151 7/8, National Semiconductor rose 1/2 to 15, Advanced Micro Devices gained 2 1/8 to 21 1/8, Analog Devices moved up 1 3/8 to 21 1/2, and Motorola added 1 1/4 to 48 5/8. Intel inched up 1/4 to to 35 on more than three million shares in OTC trading.    Most other technology stocks were strong, too. International Business Machines closed up 3/4 at 133 in active trading after selling at 134 3/8 earlier in the session. Unisys rose 3/8 to 95 3/4, Honeywell gained 1/2 to 66 1/4, NCR added 3/8 to 58 7/8, and Data General rose 3/4 to 35 3/4. But Cray Research fell 1 1/4 to 113 1/8.    American Telephone andamp; Telegraph tumbled 1 to 23 1/4 on volume of more than 5.9 million shares, making it the most active Big Board stock yesterday. Investors were reacting to the prospect that the telecommunications giant may be facing more competition. The Justice Department said Monday that it was supporting major deregulation of the telecommuncations industry and urged a federal judge to allow regional Bell operating companies to compete in long-distance, computer services and other areas.    United Telecommunications was unchanged at 27. Contel eased 1/4 to 31 3/4, and GTE eased 1/8 to 62 1/8. In OTC trading, MCI Communications fell 3/8 to 5 3/4 on volume of more than nine million shares. The seven regional phone companies that were spun off by ATandamp;T were mostly slightly lower.    Unocal fell 5/8 to 29 3/8 on more than 2.3 million shares. Prudential Insurance confirmed that it sold a 1.8 million-share block of Unocal stock early yesterday. A spokesman for the insurance company said the sale of the Unocal stock had no relationship to Prudential's plans to buy a $300 million stake in Diamond Shamrock through a convertible preferred offering.    Lockheed fell 2 3/4 to 52 7/8. The company said fourth-quarter net fell to $1.67 a share from $1.96 a year earlier.    Several other defense stocks moved lower. General Dynamics fell 1 to 73 1/4, United Technologies eased 3/8 to 48 5/8, McDonnell Douglas fell 5/8 to 74 7/8, and Martin Marietta slipped 1/4 to 44 1/4.    American Medical International rose 1 3/8 to 19 1/4 on more than 3.1 million shares. A unit of Pesch andamp; Co., a privately held firm based in Chicago, offered to acquire all of American Medical's shares for $20 each.    C.O.M.B. tumbled 4 3/4 to 25 1/4 in active trading in the OTC market. Negotiations for a possible merger with Home Shopping Network have reached an impasse. Home Shopping eased 3/4 to 38 1/2 on the American Stock Exchange.    Clarostat Manufacturing rose 3 1/4 to 73 1/4 in thin trading. The company agreed to be acquired by a unit of U.K.-based Hawker Siddeley Group PLC. </TEXT></DOC>
