Approximately 350,000 acres in 12 states eventually could become available, Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng and Interior Secretary Donald Hodel said. Under the Water Bank program, landowners are paid to preserve habitat for waterfowl and other wildlife. Cutting of hay on Water Bank land can begin immediately in counties in California, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Michigan, Nebraska and Wisconsin, as well as in certain Minnesota counties, where farmers already have been permitted to cut hay and graze cattle on so-called set-aside acres.    Additional counties in Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota and Montana will be approved for hay-cutting in the next week or so, depending on the nesting status of ducks and other waterfowl, according to officials from the Interior and Agriculture departments. </TEXT></DOC>
