Statistics released by the Federal Aviation Administration show that delays at Hartsfield, which during the period surpassed Chicago's O'Hare as the nation's busiest airport, rose to 74 per 1,000 flights from 18 per 1,000 the same time last year. The number of flights at Atlanta rose to 264,647, compared with 263,978 at Chicago.    Meanwhile, delays at Chicago dropped to 30 per 1,000 flights from 35 per 1,000 during the same period a year earlier.    Despite the overall increase in late flights, delays dropped at half of the airports. For example, delays dropped sharply to 51 per 1,000 flights from 104 per 1,000 a year ago at Newark, N.J., and to 58 per 1,000 from 83 per 1,000 at New York's LaGuardia. The agency attributed the improved performance to new air-traffic control procedures along the East Coast.    The Transportation Department has accused Delta Air Lines and Eastern Airlines of engaging in unrealistic scheduling practices at Hartsfield. The carriers have denied the allegations. Eastern is a unit of Texas Air Corp.    In another development, the FAA notified the National Transportation Safety Board that it doesn't plan to impose further air-traffic restrictions this summer, as the board had urged for safety reasons. The FAA said that its central flow-control procedures and a new computer make further flight curbs unnecessary. </TEXT></DOC>
