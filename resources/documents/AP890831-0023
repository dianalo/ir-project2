The disease is a type of leptospirosis, caused bycorkscrew-shaped bacteria called leptospires. About 180 types ofleptospires cause disease in livestock, said Carole A. Bolin,veterinary medical officer with USDA's Agricultural Research Servicein Ames, Iowa.   Bolin said in a report released here Wednesday that the disease,caused by an organism called bratislava, was found in an Iowa herd.The name resulted after the bacterium was isolated in 1953 from ahedgehog in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia.   Leptospirosis is transmitted primarily by infected urine, but theleptospires also can pass through the pregnant female's placenta tothe fetus. Another probable cause of infection is thought to bevenereal transmission from infected boars.   Humans in contact with infected animals or urine can developleptospirosis, the report said.   Outbreaks of a mysterious syndrome causing stillbirths, abortionsand pre-weaning death in pigs that began a year ago throughout theMidwest have prompted USDA scientists to look into several possiblecauses, including bacterial and viral infection, and moldy corn,Bolin said.   Bratislava infection ``is being studied as one possiblecontributing factor to this syndrome,'' she said.   The study was undertaken five months ago at the agency's animaldisease center in Ames under a ``technology transfer'' agreementwith Norden Laboratories of Lincoln, Neb.   Bolin said the next step is to inoculate pregnant sows withbratislava to ``establish absolute proof'' that the U.S. versioncauses reproductive disease. Also, laboratory tests must beconducted to determine the effectiveness of vaccines in pregnantsows.   Norden is marketing two vaccines under conditional USDA licensesand is applying for permanent licensing, she said.   Company scientist Joseph C. Frantz said vaccination with theconditionally licensed vaccine protects the animal against``clinical signs caused by bratislava'' through one pregnancy. Herecommended vaccination prior to each breeding.   Leptospirosis in both animals and humans can be mild or severe,and is often misdiagnosed, the agency said. The disease in humanshas been confused with influenza, hepatitis, yellow fever,pneumonia, polio, meningitis and encephalitis.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A partial list of changes in AgricultureDepartment regulations affecting the care and handling of animalsfor laboratory experiments and other purposes will go into effectOct. 30.   Among the changes will be a requirement that research facilitiescreate special committees to assure humane care and treatment ofanimals.   James W. Glosser, administrator of the department's Animal andPlant Health Inspection Service, said Wednesday that the revisions``will partially implement'' amendments to the federal AnimalWelfare Act passed by Congress almost four years ago.   The amendments provide new and stricter requirements to protectlaboratory animals from undue pain and stress, tighten enforcementof rules already on the books, and revise the list of definitionsneeded to carry out the law.   Current regulations define standards for animal use, includingminimum requirements for handling, housing, feeding, watering,sanitation, ventilation, shelter and veterinary care.   Glosser said the revisions will make the rules for dogs, cats andnon-human primates, including monkeys, more complete and easier tounderstand.   Besides requiring research facilities to create special animalcare committees, the new regulations include provisions forveterinary care, and holding facilities and handling.   The Animal Welfare Act covers most businesses that buy or sellwarm-blooded animals, exhibit them and transport them commercially.Rats, mice, birds, horses and farm animals are not covered by theregulations.   An agency spokeswoman, Pat El-Hinnawy, said there are three partsto the package of regulatory changes. The final decisions announcedWednesday affect only the first and second parts.   Part One includes a definition of terms used in carrying out the1985 amendments, she said. Part Two relates to the identificationmethods, records, licensing requirements and other details.   Part Three, which is still under study by the agency, willinclude details of the actual standards for federal regulation ofanimal care _ the space each must have, access to food and water,and other details that affect their routines.   El-Hinnawy said she didn't know when USDA might decide on finalrules for Part Three.   Federal animal welfare legislation was passed by Congress in 1966and covered animal dealers who raised dogs and cats for research andlaboratories conducting research on these animals.   The coverage was broadened in 1970 to include most otherwarm-blooded animals used in research, exhibited or sold in thewholesale pet trade. An amendment in 1976 extended to law to includethe transportation of live animals.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter plans tobe in Europe for meetings and trade talks Sept. 6-9.   Yeutter's office said the discussions with European leaders willcenter on agriculture negotiations under the Uruguay Round of theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.   The trip will include meetings Sept. 6 in Paris and in Brusselson Sept. 7 with officials of the European Economic Community.   On Sept. 8 he will speak in Burgenstock, Switzerland, to theSwiss Commodities, Futures and Options Association. Yeutter's talkis expected to focus on the need for reform in world trade.   Yeutter will be in Stuttgart, West Germany, on Sept. 9.</TEXT></DOC>
