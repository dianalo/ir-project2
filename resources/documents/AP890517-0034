LEDERER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Women hold the key to economic development andslower population growth but many are trapped by cultural valuesand fundamentalist religions that put men first, the head of theU.N. Population Fund says.   Dr. Nafis Sadik of Pakistan issued the agency's 1989 State ofWorld Population Report on Tuesday and called for a fivefoldincrease in world spending on family planning. She said governmentsshould put population control on a par with major economicinvestments.   With the world's population at 5.2 billion and current growth at90 million people a year the United Nations forecasts a stablepopulation of 10 billion about a hundred years from now.   ``But this will not happen unless more of the world's women aregiven more health care, family planning services, education andemployment opportunities,'' Mrs. Sadik told a news conference.   Without such measures, she said, the world's population couldnearly triple to 14 billion by the year 2100, crippling developmentand creating ``enormous potential for violence and socialupheaval.''   Nations with fast-growing populations are spending more onessentials and have little left for social programs, Mrs. Sadiksaid. In the past four years, 37 of the world's poorest countrieshave cut health spending by 50 percent and education spending by 25percent, she said.   About half the world's women live in rural areas and insocieties dominated by men and still don't have access to familyplanning, she said.   South Korea, Singapore and Thailand are economic successespartly because strong family planning programs helped reduce highrates of population growth, Mrs. Sadik said.   ``We know from the World Fertility Survey that women would havefewer children if they had access to family planning,'' she said.   ``In Latin America, 75 percent of women not using familyplanning say they want to postpone, delay or limit theirchildbearing. In Asia, the figure is 43 percent and in Africa 27percent.''   To stabilize the world's population at 10 billion, populationgrowth must decline by one-third in the next 40 years, the reportsays.   Mrs. Sadik said the U.N. Population Fund set a goal of extendingfamily planning services to an additional 500 million women by theyear 2000 and raise the number of contraceptive users from 465million today to 730 million.   The fund, which has projects in 130 countries, urged governmentsto earmark at least 1 percent of gross national product for familyplanning.   Mrs. Sadik also called for a great expansion in women'seducation and literacy, an end to legal and social discriminationagainst women and greater access to leadership positions for women.   She said that even many educated men do not see a need forequality and opportunity and that religious fundamentalism seems``to be designed to somehow keep women in bondage.''   Mrs. Sadik mentioned Pope John Paul II and Moslemfundamentalists, but said, ``All religious movements look at thewoman as the one who should cater to and serve the family, neverthe other gender.''</TEXT></DOC>
