In spite of a capital squeeze, 66% of theseentrepreneurial companies surveyed by Ernst andamp; Young said theyplanned to raise new capital in the next year through one ormore methods. &quot;Most of that money will go to fund newproducts and services and expansion into new geographicmarkets, domestic as well as global,&quot; says Scott Franklin, anexecutive with the firm's entrepreneurial services group inDallas.</LP><TEXT>   About 40% said that banks still were a likely source ofnew capital, for either short-term or long-term debt. About25%, mostly companies with sales of less than $15 million,said they would look to private placement of equity. And 16%said they planned a public offering of stock to solve theircapital needs.   &quot;Small companies are responding to the warm reception thatnew issues have enjoyed in the last few months,&quot; says RichardShaffer, editor of Technologic Letter, a New York industrynewsletter. The recent successful offerings by such high-techcompanies as Sybase, Progress Software, WellfleetCommunications and Quarterdeck Office Systems are encouragingothers to try to &quot;get a piece of the action,&quot; says Mr.Shaffer.   Small companies plan to raise $900 million in stockofferings over the next six months, investment bankers say.   ---   JAPANESE INVESTORS get their feet in the door of U.S.biotechnology faster.   Japanese companies, once content to settle for licensingrights to products developed by U.S. biotechnology companies,now are stepping in earlier to finance early research. Amongrecent deals:   Chugai Pharmaceutical Co. will finance research andreceive commercialization rights to certain drugs beingdeveloped by Vertex Pharmaceuticals Corp., Cambridge, Mass.Estimated value to Vertex: $30 million.   Also, Green Cross Corp. will fund certain research and inreturn receive marketing rights to AIDS drugs being developedby Viagene Inc., San Diego. Estimated value to Viagene: $40million.   &quot;There's great pressure on Japanese pharmaceuticalcompanies to find new products that can boost sales andprofits,&quot; says Roger Longman, editor of In Vivo, a Norwalk,Conn., industry newsletter. But the Japanese also arediscovering that &quot;the earlier they invest, the more they canget,&quot; he says.   &quot;The Japanese have made very specific decisions aboutwhich areas they want to invest in,&quot; says investment bankerNancy Olson of Rx Capital, San Carlos, Calif. &quot;They arelooking for the best technology. It's not a make-versus-buydecision for them,&quot; she says.   Entrepreneurs say that the Japanese also are moresophisticated than in the past in the way they structuredeals. &quot;They have realized that they can get better terms byworking with small biotechnology companies that needcapital,&quot; says Stanley Crooke, chief executive officer, IsisPharmaceuticals, Carlsbad, Calif.   Isis, which is developing &quot;anti-sense&quot; genes that blockthe action of natural genes in viruses, recently signed aco-development deal with Eisai Co., valued at an estimated$10 million to Isis.   ---   ASIA REPLACES the U.S. as the main target for Japaneseventure capital.   Though U.S. biotechnology still entices them, Japaneseventure capital funds increasingly seek investmentopportunities in mature Asian companies in other sectors.Japan's largest venture-capital firms plan to increase theirinvestments in Asian companies to a total of about $420million by the end of March 1992, double the level at the endof March this year, says the Nikkei Weekly, a businesspublication.   &quot;The Japanese are looking for markets where there isbetter value and less risk,&quot; says Michael Kaufman, whose MKGlobal Ventures, Palo Alto, Calif., invests mostly inU.S.-Japan ventures. &quot;They mostly are targeting maturefamily-owned businesses in other Asian countries where ownerswant liquidity,&quot; he says.   Investors in Japan Associated Finance, known as Jafco, seeAsia as a more attractive market than the U.S., says ShoichiFujikawa, the fund's president. &quot;It's difficult to make moneyhere {in the U.S.},&quot; he says. &quot;It's too competitive.&quot;   But the interest in Asia also reflects Japanesedisillusionment with U.S. venture investing in the computerindustry. &quot;They wanted to get a closer look at U.S.technology at an early stage,&quot; says Anthony Hoberman, whoinvests in venture capital funds for Alliance CapitalManagement Inc., New York. &quot;What they've seen hasn't beenenough to convince them to put up more money.&quot;   ---   AN ALABAMA HIGH-TECH incubator finds deep pockets.   &quot;Companies with promising technologies often lack theskills to develop the technology into viable commercialproducts,&quot; says Martin Tilson Jr., director of the Office forthe Advancement of Developing Industries at the University ofAlabama at Birmingham. &quot;They also lack the necessary capitalfor commercialization,&quot; he adds. Mr. Tilson heads theuniversity's 36,000 square-foot high tech incubator, whichcurrently is home to 14 companies, mostly in biotechnology,computers and environmental sciences. Incubators providespace and services to fledgling companies.   One company that has received investments from non-Alabamaventure firms is Secretech Inc., a biotechnology start-upwhich currently is developing an oral vaccine for influenza.Euclid Partners, New York, and Senmed Medical Ventures,Cincinnati, have together invested $1.8 million in thetwo-year-old company.   Other companies currently in the incubator are designingdrugs through X-ray crystallography, developing biomaterialsto replace damaged body parts, and producing devices tomeasure toxicity in air. Every six months or so, theincubator plans to showcase six or eight such companies tonational venture-capital firms.   &quot;For venture capitalists not familiar with the area, theincubator acts as a screen for new and promising ideas,&quot; saysStephen Reidy, a partner at Euclid. In addition, theincubator provides an organizational structure toentrepreneurs and scientists trying to develop newtechnologies, he says.</TEXT></DOC>
