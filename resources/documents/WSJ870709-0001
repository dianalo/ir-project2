A lawyer representing Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., the Wall Street securities firm that agreed yesterday afternoon to purchase 4.1 million Pay 'N Pak shares on Mr. Bilzerian's behalf, said late last night the brokerage house was canceling the transaction.    The purchase would have given Mr. Bilzerian a roughly 51% stake in Pay 'N Pak.    In another late development yesterday, a federal judge in Seattle issued a temporary restraining order enjoining Mr. Bilzerian or his representatives &quot;from completing or consummating&quot; the purchase of Pay 'N Pak's shares. The judge didn't say why the court issued the restraining order, and ordered Mr. Bilzerian's attorneys to appear in court tomorrow &quot;to show cause&quot; why the court shouldn't issue a preliminary injunction prohibiting the Bilzerian purchase.    Mr. Bilzerian, reached late last night at his home, said he hadn't seen the judge's restraining order and wouldn't comment on it. He also said he didn't learn of Morgan Stanley's decision to rescind the trade until his broker called him at about 11:30 EDT last night. &quot;He said they'd have an explanation in the morning, so I won't know until then what we're going to do,&quot; he said while his lawyers held on another telephone line.    Just hours earlier, Mr. Bilzerian ended a day of rumors and said he had bought the block of shares, apparently quashing the company's plans to go private in a leveraged buyout.    The company has opted for a management-led buyout plan, and has rebuffed repeated offers from the Tampa, Fla., financier.    As previously reported, Pay 'N Pak last month agreed to a $212.5 million leveraged buyout by Rosewood Corp., a group that includes members of Pay 'N Pak's management. The buyout offer, which is contingent on two-thirds of the company's shares being validly tendered, expires at 12:01 a.m. EDT Saturday.    The struggle for control of the company had evolved into a grudge match. And Mr. Bilzerian earlier said of the company's management: &quot;I couldn't throw them out fast enough.&quot;    But yesterday, flush with what seemed an apparent victory, Mr. Bilzerian softened his stand, saying, &quot;I'm hoping we can make peace with management.&quot;    &quot;It's our intention to give remaining shareholders more value&quot; than they would have received under the management offer, he added.    George Bason, an attorney with the New York firm Davis Polk andamp; Wardwell, which is representing Morgan Stanley, refused to comment on why the firm made the highly unusual decision to cancel the transaction.    He did say, however, that the brokerage decided to rescind the trade before the court in Seattle issued the restraining order, &quot;and before Morgan Stanley or any of its representatives knew such an order was being sought&quot; by Pay 'N Pak's lawyers.    Pay 'N Pak had maintained that Mr. Bilzerian was prevented from buying any more company stock by a standstill agreement he signed in April.    But Mr. Bilzerian had countered the purchase was permissible. He said recent actions by management caused a &quot;material adverse change&quot; in the company, triggering a clause in the agreement that allows him to buy more stock.    Mr. Bilzerian cited as one change a clause in the management group's buyout offer that gives Rosewood as much as $9.5 million in cancellation fees and expenses if a third party acquires more than a 30% stake in the company.    Under the standstill agreement with Pay 'N Pak, Mr. Bilzerian was to receive certain confidential information and, in exchange, agreed not to acquire any company stock beyond his roughly 10% stake without the company's approval for a 230-day period. Having begun April 17, the 230-day period would presumably bar such purchases until after November.    Morgan Stanley had handled the 4.1 million-share block trade on the New York Stock Exchange at $21.25 a share, giving the transaction a value of about $87.1 million.    The shares were traded as a next-day block, meaning the trade would settle today. Usually, there is a five-day gap between the day of the trade and the day of settlement.    Pay 'N Pak closed yesterday at $21.125 a share, unchanged. It was the most-active issue on the Big Board.    The company had rejected a series of offers made by Mr. Bilzerian, including one last week that he valued at $220 million.    The management group's buyout bid is structured to give shareholders $17 in cash and preferred stock valued at $4.25 for each share. The tender offer set to expire this week is for 8.1 million shares at $21 each, with holders to subsequently receive the remainder in preferred on a pro-rata basis. </TEXT></DOC>
