In this work, 24,000 pounds of synthetic surrogatesoil containing a wide range of chemical contaminants was prepared fortreatment by rotary kiln incineration. Waste feed, scrubber water, ash,and stack gas samples were collected during each of the six four-hourtest burns. The results of the analyses of the samples obtained duringthe combustion of the surrogate soil will be discussed in detail andthe calculated destruction efficiencies for organic compounds given.In addition, distribution of the metallic components in the incineratoreffluents and ash will be discussed in detail.</TEXT></DOC>
