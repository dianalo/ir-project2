By 1984, when his 40-yeargovernment career ended, Fossan was helping out the State Departmentin 34 languages.   ``He was the most remarkable translator we ever had,'' Obst says.   Several years ago, the paucity of bright, bilingual Americansforced the State Department to drop a requirement that candidatesfor the foreign service be fluent in a second language. The reasonwas that too many talented people had to be passed over because ofthe requirement.   In other countries, language training ``is mandatory in highschool, mandatory in college, and, as a result, you have a good basefrom which you can work,'' Obst says.   Stephen Bosworth, president of the United States-JapanFoundation, a private group based in New York, says increasingnumbers of U.S. public schools want to add Japanese to theircurriculum but many can't find qualified teachers.   He adds that American businesses give low priority to expertisein Japanese. Given a choice between giving a job to someone trainedin Japanese and another who has a master's in businessadministration, ``they'll always pick the one with the MBA,'' hesays.   At the State Department, a linguist must be able to interpretsimultaneously and consecutively into both his native and acquiredlanguages, demands that are ``unheard of'' elsewhere, Obst says. Hemust be able to toss off colloquialisms on issues ranging from RioGrande salinity problems to high energy physics to the nuclear fuelcycle.   Linguists say a nimble mind must be supplemented by a number ofother traits as well: motivation, a spirit of adventure, curiosity,self-confidence, a wish to communicate and ``an omnivorous appetitefor the myriad flavors that foreign cultures come in,'' as thecurrent issue of the Foreign Service Journal puts it.   Making life more difficult still for State Department languagerecruiters is that the agency's salaries are generally smaller thanthose of international organizations, which compete for the sametalent.   At the State Department, an interpreter without supervisoryresponsibilities can earn up to $71,000. For a translator, who dealsexclusively with printed material, the peak salary is $65,000.   He says salaries at the United Nations are 10 percent to 15percent higher, but others maintain the gap is even wider.   Besides the United Nations, the State Department also competesfor linguists with such international organizations as the WorldBank, the International Monetary Fund and the Organization ofAmerican States. Unlike the State Department, these institutions canhire non-Americans and don't have to worry about security clearances.   According to Obst, experts in Japanese, Russian, Chinese andPortuguese are the most difficult to find.   One New York-based firm provides Japanese-language interpretersfor $450 a day. When it hires a Japanese language free-lancer, theState Department pays $325 a day, $300 for other languages.   Still, rubbing elbows with the president during a meeting with aforeign luminary is one of the attractions of interpreting for theState Department.   Stephanie Van Reigersberg, chief of the State Department'sinterpreting division and a fluent speaker of Spanish and French,sat at the side of George Bush during his post-election meeting withMexico's new president, Carlos Salinas de Gortari.   Ms. Van Reigersberg says the psychic rewards of helping out thepresident and other top officials compensate for the othershortcomings of being a State Department interpreter.   In contrast, she says, at the United Nations, ``it's blah, blah,blah about structural adjustment loans.''   ``The people who come tend to stay,'' she says. ``But findingpeople is getting to be impossible.''</TEXT><NOTE>END ADV</NOTE></DOC>
