Apple is studying whether to license a microprocessor fromIBM that sits at the heart of Big Blue's RS/6000 workstationline, an Apple executive said. IBM, meanwhile, may want someof Apple's software technology, which might benefit IBM'sbeleaguered OS/2 operating software, say other peoplefamiliar with the talks.</LP><TEXT>   The negotiations are preliminary and may not lead to adeal, the Apple executive warned. Other industry officialsadd that Apple in the past has engaged in extensive talksabout alliances without actually proceeding.   Some observers are skeptical that IBM and Apple can gettogether on technology, given the differences in culture andpractice at the two companies. &quot;There are talks going on, butI don't think they are meaningful,&quot; said Jean-Louis Gassee,formerly chief of Apple's research and development. Othersthink Apple and IBM won't agree on hardware, but will limitthemselves to a software deal, such as joint support for anew pen-based computer operating system from Go Corp. &quot;Iwouldn't fall out of my chair if that happened,&quot; said StewartAlsop, editor of PC Letter, an industry newsletter.   But Apple's talks with IBM are important because Apple'schoice of IBM's chip would hurt makers of rival chips,especially Motorola Inc.; push Apple into the workstationfray, which it so far has avoided; and make IBM a strongerplayer in workstations. Meanwhile, IBM's interest in reducingits dependence on Microsoft Corp. for software dovetails withApple's own long-term ambition to become a major supplier ofprograms for all sorts of personal computers.   The IBM chip in question uses a technology calledreduced-instruction-set computing, or Risc. Risc chips areincreasingly popular among computer makers because they aremuch faster than coventional microprocessors.   Apple has said it will choose a Risc chip for futurecomputers, and analysts think the company will make a finaldecision this year. A half-dozen companies are battling eachother to woo computer makers to their Risc chips, hoping tocreate a standard around their chip much as Intel Corp. chipsare now a personal-computer standard. By putting its weightbehind a Risc chip, Apple will inevitably make the chip morelikely to become a big force in computing.   Apple and IBM won't comment officially on the talks. Thetwo companies have never established any wide-rangingtechnology agreement. Until this month -- when Apple beganshipping high-end Macintosh personal computers equipped withIBM-made hard-disk drives -- the two companies neveracknowledged any formal ties.   The talks between IBM and Apple are unusual and illustratehow recent shifts in the computer industry are forcing evenarchrivals to consider cooperating. In the mid-'80s, Applelampooned IBM in a television advertisement that suggestedBig Blue acted like George Orwell's Big Brother by limitingcustomers' computer choices to unimaginative designs. IBMtreated Apple as a marginal competitor that drew its strengthfrom sales to schools and not from the ties with bigcorporations on which IBM thrived.   Times have changed. Apple is struggling to craft anapproach it calls &quot;enterprise&quot; computing, which will offerone-stop shopping to major computer buyers who need not onlydesktop machines but also back-office behemoths that runmundane business operations. &quot;Apple needs a new high-endproduct line {built} around Risc,&quot; says Charles Wolf, ananalyst at First Boston Corp. Mr. Wolf says the new line,which will &quot;unfold over the next couple of years,&quot; willrequire a new software system to control the basic functionsof the machine. This new system ultimately will replaceApple's Macintosh operating system, &quot;though presumably thenew system will be compatible with the Macintosh,&quot; Mr. Wolfsays.   IBM, meanwhile, has recently awakened to the shortcomingsof its reliance on Microsoft Corp. for its software and Intelfor its microprocessors. Sales of IBM's PCs have slumpedlately, and in response Big Blue is cutting prices,introducing new models and, most importantly, cobblingtogether an approach to software that will both free it fromdependence on Microsoft and distinguish it from makers of IBMclones. The company has recently signed deals with severalsoftware companies and is looking at Apple as a potentialally in its bid to revive OS/2, which was introduced fouryears ago but hasn't caught on with many customers.   For their part, Apple executives have whetted IBM'sappetite by privately saying that Apple's software unit,Claris, intends to aggressively produce applications fornon-Macintosh systems, including OS/2. According to DanEilers, chief of Claris, Apple is attracted by the highprofit margins earned by software heavyweights such asMicrosoft and is studying how it could build a broad softwareapplications business.   Another factor bringing IBM and Apple to the table: amutual suspicion of Microsoft, whose clout over the PCindustry has steadily risen in recent years.   Earlier this year, Apple had decided informally on a Riscchip from Motorola. Apple's decision to play the field againis a big blow for Motorola, which was counting on Apple tojump-start interest in Motorola's own Risc chip, the 88000family. Motorola's microprocessors go into all Macintoshmachines, but still constitute less than 10% of the PCmarket. Few computer companies have decided to use the 88000,which Motorola describes as the chip that will help it wrestmarket share from Intel.   Motorola officials wouldn't comment on Apple's decision tolook elsewhere. But people familiar with Motorola concededthat Apple was deferring its decision on the Risc chip untilMotorola proved it could deliver the chip on schedule. &quot;Theyare holding out on any kind of formal statements until theysee the 88110 working in a machine,&quot; one person said.   Indeed, Apple is re-evaluating its chip decision in partbecause of Motorola's recent poor track record of deliveringchips on time. Last year, Motorola angered computer makers bydelaying by over six months an important microprocessorcalled the 68040. A Motorola spokesman said that the nextgeneration of its Risc chip -- the one Apple would beinterested in -- is on schedule for shipment later this year.   Apple is also looking at a Risc chip from Hewlett-PackardCo. as a possible choice to power its future machines.Hewlett-Packard has been a dark horse in the Risc wars, butwowed the computer world in March when it unveiled Riscmachines that doubled the performance of rival'sworkstations. Since then, &quot;there has been a surge of interestin licensing out {Risc} architecture,&quot; an H-P spokeswomansaid. &quot;We're talking to a lot of people. Apple is amongthose.&quot;   Apple has been a wild card in the Risc wars because it isthe only big computer maker that hasn't yet decided on a Riscstrategy. A decision by Apple to adopt either IBM's orHewlett-Packard's Risc chip would be a powerful force againstworkstatation-market leaders such as Sun Microsystems Inc.and Mips Computer Systems Inc. With two of the world'sbiggest computer makers behind the same chip, softwarewriters would be eager to create programs for computers usingthat chip, lifting sales.</TEXT></DOC>
