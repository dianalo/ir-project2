They said the steering gear of the 152-foot Sirius was sealedoff by Spanish officials soon after the craft arrived at thisMediterranean Balearic island port on Friday.   Navy authorities told the captain, Ed Engels, that the Siriuswas to stay in Ibiza until further orders and could not set sail oruse its rubber rafts, according to the port officials who spoke oncondition of anonymity.   Crewmembers of the USS Dwight David Eisenhower carrier turnedwater hoses on anti-nuclear protesters in four rubber dinghieslaunched from the Sirius who tried to stop the warship fromentering Palma port on Thursday.   Xavier Pastor, a Greenpeace official, said in a communiqueThursday the environmental organization was protesting the Spanishgovernment's allowing nuclear weapons into its territorial watersin violation of a March 1986 referendum.   Green peace claims the carrier is equipped with nucleararmaments.   It is U.S. policy not to confirm or deny whether a U.S. ship hasnuclear weapons.   Spaniards voted in 1986 to retain membership in the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization with the conditions that Spain be freeof nuclear weapons, the U.S. military presence be reduced andSpain's armed forces remain outside the integrated NATO militarycommand.   Pastor said a Spanish navy official and two sailors were on dutyaboard the Sirius and national police kept watch on the ship fromport.   ``Nobody informed us on the cause of stopping the ship,'' hesaid.   A U.S. official, who spoke on condition he not be identified,confirmed that Greenpeace had ``attempted to interfere with thedocking'' of the carrier but said it anchored successfully withoutdamage or injury to either side.</TEXT></DOC>
