Salah Khalaf, the No. 2 man in the Palestine LiberationOrganization, spoke in a videotaped appeal to ``every child inIsrael, every woman and every man.'' The 15-minute video was tapedin Tunisia, smuggled into Israel and screened at a peace symposiumin Jerusalem.   ``The realistic solution is that we live side by side and that wewalk the path of peace,'' said Khalaf, known by his nom de guerreAbu Iyad. ``Some people wonder if this coexistence is a first stage.We answer no. We want a definite settlement.''   In the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, nine Palestinians werewounded in clashes with troops, Arab doctors said.   In the West Bank village of Beit Amin, residents found the bodyof Muhammed Abed Suleiman, 25, who was suspected of cooperating withIsraeli authorities. Police said the body was found in a well.   The army said it was checking the reports.   At least 384 Palestinians and 16 Israelis have been killed sincethe Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule of the West Bank andGaza Strip began in December 1987.   In what appeared to be a conciliatory gesture, Khalaf divergedfrom previous PLO positions and called for direct talks with Israel.In the past, the PLO has insisted that negotiations be held in theframework of an international Middle East peace conference.   ``We believe in direct meetings, we are ready for such meetings,and we say it publicly. Let the Israelis come and meet us secretly,openly or in any other way. We are anxious for such a meeting,''Khalaf said, speaking in Arabic and sitting next to a largePalestinian flag.   Reporters were given a written English translation.   ``What is important for us is that these meetings and contactsand dialogues take place in advance of the conference so that theconference itself becomes the form in which to bring our agreementto fruition,'' he said.   Liberal and leftist Israeli legislators have met in recent weekswith Faisal Husseini, a top PLO supporter in Jerusalem, and with PLOofficials abroad.   Husseini, who also spoke at the symposium, said he and otherPalestinian notables could not serve as a substitute for talks withthe PLO.   ``We shall continue ... to emphasize the indivisibility of thePalestinian people as well as the necessity of involving the PLO inany future settlement,'' he said.   As Husseini spoke, about 10 Israelis wearing skullcaps, a mark ofobservant Jews, interrupted his speech.   ``Dirty Arab! PLO garbage!'' shouted one before being dragged outby a policeman. Police later returned to search for bombs.   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has rejected theinternational conference and any contacts with the PLO, which heconsiders a terrorist organization.   Khalaf responded to Israeli fears the PLO's moderate stance wasjust a ploy to trick Israel.   Calling for a Palestinian state alongside Israel, he said: ``Allother matters are open to discussion. Our covenant and yours can bediscussed.'' He was referring to the Palestinian National Charter,which calls for the destruction of Israel.   ``Does any Israeli really believe in his heart that it ispossible to destroy 5 million Palestinians? We have asked a similarquestion of ourselves and have concluded that we cannot destroy theIsraelis,'' Khalaf said.   The videotape was shown at a symposium on the Arab-Israeliconflict organized by the International Center for Peace in theMiddle East, a private Tel Aviv think tank headed by former IsraeliForeign Minister Abba Eban.</TEXT></DOC>
