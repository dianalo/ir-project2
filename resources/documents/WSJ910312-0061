Ms. Baker's car was one of 165,000 recalled last fall byFord Motor Co., which feared defective bags could leakburning gases on occupants. When she got the recall notice,Ms. Baker says, &quot;I thought, my goodness, I'm going to bedriving down the turnpike at 70 and -- boom]&quot;</LP><TEXT>   For TRW Inc., maker of the defective bags, the recall wasfollowed by explosions of another sort. Late Friday, Ford,TRW's main customer, canceled plans to use the Clevelandconglomerate's air bags exclusively, saying it will buy 20%of its air bags from TRW rivals. And that may be just thebeginning. &quot;By the mid-1990s, there will be sufficientquality and capacity from suppliers to do multiple sourcing,&quot;says Robert H. Munson, Ford auto safety director.   TRW, which has been counting on air bags to lift itsdisappointing defense, automotive parts and credit reportingunits, has so far pumped $500 million into the business andplans to double that number by 1996. But the investment is injeopardy: TRW has suffered a series of chemical explosions,quality problems and management shake-ups that causedshipment delays to most major car makers as well as the hugeFord recall.   TRW's mishaps with air bags demonstrate the difficulty ofturning an experimental technology into a mass-produced item.To speed production, TRW took shortcuts and made crucialmistakes.   TRW Chairman Joseph T. Gorman acknowledges heunderestimated the demands and costs of the air-bag business,but says the problems were merely part of the learning curve.&quot;I don't think it will hurt in the long run,&quot; says Mr.Gorman, who projects air bags will be TRW's strongest growtharea.   But others involved say the problems were unusual andlargely unexpected. Analysts estimate that TRW lost $30million to $40 million last year on its air-bag business,which had about $300 million in sales. Mr. Gorman, whoearlier projected that air bags would be profitable in 1990,now says &quot;it could be another two years.&quot;   TRW still has a third of the $900 million world-wideair-bag business, a market it expects to reach $5.3 billionby 1995. But its leadership position has been undermined. Aspart of its move away from an exclusive contract with TRW,for example, Ford has dropped plans to use TRW crash sensorsfor its 1992 cars, tapping Breed Automotive Corp. instead.Breed's sales jumped 326% in 1990.   Another competitor, Morton International Inc., whichclaims it already makes over half of all air-bag inflators,wants to double production within five years. Then there'sAllied-Signal Inc., which hopes for bigger contracts for the1995 model year and beyond.   Nobody expected such troubles for TRW, which in 1981jumped to an early lead in the air-bag business. Thoughair-bags had been around for half a century and wereinstalled in a few cars in the early 1970s, they didn't catchon, and most air-bag suppliers got out of the business.   But buoyed by a 1984 government ruling requiring passiverestraints in all cars by 1993, air bags came into fashion.And TRW was in the driver's seat. In 1987, it won a five-yearcontract to be Ford's main supplier and later won contractsfrom all the big auto makers.   &quot;We didn't expect it so fast,&quot; says Ruben F. Mettler, whowas TRW's chairman at the time and is now a director. Thecompany, which had expected its air-bag business to grow atan annual rate of 10%, saw sales grow by 500% from 1987 to1990.   To keep up with that growth, TRW had to scramble. Itconverted some of its space-technology operations, boughtTechnar Inc. to make crash sensors, and acquired the rightsto Eaton Corp.'s air-bag technology and Talley IndustriesInc.'s air-bag modules business. It also formed Sabag Inc., achemical-making joint venture with a Canadian partner.   Mr. Gorman tried to spur performance by shaking upmanagement. By his own estimate, &quot;certainly over 50%&quot; ofTRW's automotive operating managers and vice presidents leftthe company or were fired. Some familiar with the situationput the number at 80%. Mr. Gorman says the changes were meantto unclog bureaucracy.   Mr. Gorman, a former corporate counsel, has consolidatedhis own power since 1987 and is now chairman, chief executiveofficer, president, acting chief operating officer and headof the automotive business. Critics contend that hisautocratic style forces subordinates to forgo strategicplanning in favor of short-term production. &quot;Workers arerunning scared to hit artificial goals -- and that's how youget the air-bag debacles,&quot; says one former vice president,who didn't want to be named.   Mr. Gorman says he has &quot;disciplined the {air-bag business}to be around break-even,&quot; but insists his actions didn'tcause TRW's mistakes.   At TRW's Sabag venture in Quebec last year, a workerpounded a jammed conveyer belt with a hammer, causing copperfrom a rivet to mix with chemicals and spark a major fire.Canadian safety officals say that to save space Sabag used animproper conveyor, which couldn't handle increased volume.That led to a jam and the worker's pounding of the belt.   The fire was the worst of several blazes at the site, andthe Quebec government shut down the plant for nearly a year;Sabag is only reopening now. &quot;There was a lack of proceduresand a lack of controls,&quot; says Raymond Labonte, regionalsafety and health director in Quebec. &quot;Nobody was responsiblefor the operation of the plant.&quot;   The company concedes there were problems at the Sabagfacility, and says that the plant has been completelyoverhauled. The fires delayed shipments to auto makers, andFord says deliveries are still behind. TRW has since built asecond, back-up plant in Mesa, Ariz., but that one, too,suffered a minor blaze in January in a test-run.   At the Talley Industries facility, TRW tried to accelerateproduction by using robots to automate previously manualtasks. But an out-of-tolerance machine damaged threading on ajoint in the air-bag module. That led to the large recall byFord, which hadn't kept track of inventories, to find 3,133defective bags. Other car makers had smaller recalls.   No injuries occurred because of the defect, and TRWstresses that relatively few air bags had problems. Still,Ford says it wants TRW to pay a share of the multimilliondollar recall. Separately, TRW has sought to reduce paymentsto Talley, claiming the operations didn't reach agreed-uponproduction levels. Talley responded with a lawsuit. &quot;Whatthey bought was what we suggested it was,&quot; says TalleyTreasurer Dan Mullen.   Messrs. Mettler and Gorman both now acknowledge that TRWshould have handled its air-bag business differently. Mr.Gorman says TRW should have pumped more capital into thebusiness at its early stages and built back-up facilitiessooner. He would have put in more &quot;fail-safe&quot; designs tocatch production glitches such as the one at Talley. &quot;Therecall wouldn't have occurred if we had a better design,&quot; hesays.   &quot;If we did it over again,&quot; says Mr. Mettler, &quot;we'd besmarter.&quot;   ---                 TRW: Deflated Circumstances                                                                                                                              TRW's Businesses                                                                                                          Lines of business as a percent of 1990 revenue                                                                                                        Automotive                              50.3% Space and defense                       40.4% Information systems and services         9.3%</TEXT></DOC>
