Bush urged Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to accept hischallenge to intensify negotiations on reducing conventional NATOand Warsaw Pact forces. ``I have reason to believe that he knowswe've been serious,'' Bush said.   The president said he hoped Gorbachev will be persuaded by the``unity of the alliance'' behind Bush's proposals for loweringtroop levels to 275,000 on each side and negotiating new ceilingsfor tanks, aircraft and other conventional weapons on the Europeancontinent.   Bush said his goal was to ``finally free Europe from theconstant threat of a surprise attack and the shadow of Sovietmilitary power.'' And as an inducement to Gorbachev, he said hisarms proposals ``should save him a lot of money in the long run.''   ``I think it's a good thing, it's good for NATO, I happen tothink it's good for the entire free world,'' Bush told a televisedpost-summit news conference before he flew to Bonn for furthertalks with West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.   During a 30-minute session, Kohl thanked Bush for resolving thedispute over short-range weapons that had threatened to disrupt thesummit and hailed the compromise plan as a move that ``showsinspiration emanating from the leadership of the United States.''   ``Mr. President, it was a wise and right decision at a veryimportant point in time,'' Kohl said during a brief exchange withreporters following the meeting.   The president said the United States is ``very pleased with thereaction to the NATO decision taken.''   Bush said Secretary of State James A. Baker III had told SovietForeign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze that the United States wasinterested in a superpower summit before the end of the year.   ``If there was something constructive to come out of such ameeting, I would certainly be prepared to meet and I believe thatSecretary Baker has conveyed that to Minister Shevardnadze,'' Bushsaid.   Baker said in an interview on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America''show that plans for a Bush-Gorbachev summit will depend on theSoviet leadership's reaction to the president's latest proposals.   The 16 summit leaders disposed of a potentially disruptive issueby embracing a compromise formula for U.S.-Soviet negotiations onreducing _ but not eliminating _ short-range nuclear weapons. Bushtold reporters he would never accept a nuclear-free Europe.   Then, in a final communique ending their two-day talks, theallied leaders acknowledged Bush's goal of completing East-Westnegotiations on reducing conventional arms within the next year.   Arriving in Paris for a human rights conference, Shevardnadzesaid the Bush proposals were ``attractive'' and ``a step in theright direction.'' But he said ``it will take time to examine theAmerican proposals in detail and determine the position of theU.S.S.R.''   The summit leaders also welcomed widespread changes under way inthe Soviet Union and East Europe, initiated by Gorbachev's reformpolicies.   ``The possibilities for fruitful dialogue have significantlyimproved in recent years,'' they said. ``The allies are resolved tograsp this opportunity.''   The allies said attainment of lasting peace ``will require thatthe unnatural division of Europe, and particularly of Germany, beovercome.''   In a separate declaration, the summiteers said: ``We want toovercome the painful division of Europe, which we have neveraccepted. We want to move beyond the postwar period.'' They saidthey wanted to ``shape a new political order of peace in Europe.''   The missile agreement was endorsed by the United States, Britainand West Germany, key antagonists in the dispute, and NATOSecretary-General Manfred Woerner credited Bush for summit's happyending. ``His leadership set the tone for the whole meeting,''Woerner said.   The agreement, drafted after eight hours of intense bargainingby NATO foreign ministers, authorizes the United States to beginnegotiations with the Soviets ``to achieve a partial reduction'' ofshort-range nuclear missiles once implementation of a conventionalarms agreement begins.   The word ``partial'' was underlined, presumably at theinsistence of the British, who had vehemently opposed a West Germanpreference for negotiations to eliminate all such missiles.   Kohl couldn't resist taking a few jabs at British Prime MinisterMargaret Thatcher, his chief adversary in the missile dispute.   ``Margaret Thatcher stood up for her interests, in hertemperamental way,'' Kohl amid laughter from reporters. ``We dosometimes have differences of opinion. We have differenttemperaments. And she's a woman and I'm not.''   Praising Bush's leadership, Mrs. Thatcher said she was ``very,very satisfied'' with the missile agreement. As for the WestGermans, she said, ``it is all written there very firmly indeedand, wriggle as they may, that is what they have all signed upfor.''   At the final summit session, Bush declared that ``a strongEurope means a strong America,'' and that U.S. troops would remainon European soil as long as needed.   The missile issue once threatened to disrupt the summitcelebration of NATO's 40th anniversary, but harmony was assuredwhen West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher gave uphis fight for negotiating a total missile ban.   ``It's a success,'' Genscher said.   Under the compromise, NATO will delay until 1992 a vote onwhether to modernize Lance tactical nuclear weapons ``in light ofoverall security developments.''   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush regardedthe summit as ``a very decisive and historic turning point for theNATO alliance.''   The post-midnight missile accord was the second majorachievement of the two-day summit. On Monday, President Bushproposed, and the allies endorsed, a plan for cutting American andSoviet combat troops in Europe to 275,000 on each side.   Bush and Kohl had represented opposing camps in the quarrel overshort-range nuclear missiles. The compromise, which the White Housesaid was crafted primarily by Baker, was written to allow eachleader to claim a partial victory.   ``We're very satisfied,'' Kohl told reporters as he entered NATOheadquarters this morning for the final summit session. Asked howthe agreement was reached, Bush replied, ``Very carefully.''   British sources said Mrs. Thatcher had abandoned her effort tohave the final agreement include a ``reservation'' explicitlyforbidding a negotiated elimination of all tactical nuclear weapons.   These sources said Mrs. Thatcher was pleased that the agreementwould allow negotiators to reduce _ but not eliminate _ the NATOand Warsaw Pact short-range missiles. The compromise, reached aftereight hours of bargaining, ``was a very good outcome,'' said oneBritish source. ``Our position is now safeguarded.''   The cutbacks would be linked to the East-West talks in Vienna toreduce troops, tanks, artillery and other conventional weapons. Themissile negotiations could not begin until an accord was reached toreduce those conventional forces and the two alliances had actuallystarted to carry out those cutbacks.   And the nuclear cutbacks could not start until the conventionalcuts were finished, said the U.S. official.   For Bonn, the agreement puts the alliance in favor of eventualmissile negotiations if certain conditions are met. Washington andLondon had opposed such talks.   For Washington, the language ensures that negotiations would notstart in the near future and would be tied to large Soviet cutbacksin conventional arms. Moreover, it provides only for partialreductions, not the total elimination of the weapons.   The draft communique sidesteps another contentious issue bycalling for keeping the missiles up to date, but not specificallysaying when they should be modernized.   The United States and Britain want to more than triple the rangeof 88 U.S.-built Lance launchers to just under 300 miles, while theWest Germans opposed making the weapons more powerful.</TEXT></DOC>
