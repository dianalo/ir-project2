<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-82-1297 </DOCNO><TEXT>A process for removing hydrogen sulfide from gas mixtures containing itis described. The gas is treated with a washing material containing aqueousalkaline vanadium with a valency of five as the means of oxidation. Thehydrogen sulfide is absorbed by the washing material and is oxidisedto sulfur, reducing the vanadium from a valency of five to one of four.The reduced washing material is then regenerated by re-oxidation of thevanadium with a valency of four in the presence of a promoter. An organicnitrogen compound, an inorganic amine or a carbon hydrate is used aspromoter, or compounds resulting from the contact of the above-mentionedsubstances with acid gases are used for this purpose.</TEXT></DOC>
