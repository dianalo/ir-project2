As White House officials cautioned any military strike mightharm the captives themselves, one administration source saidmilitary action remained ``in the realm of the possible.'' Butanother official said that both a hostage rescue operation and amilitary strike were ``not attractive options.''   Bush met for 1{ hours in the Cabinet Room with senior nationalsecurity and foreign policy advisers, one day after the reportedhanging of Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins in Lebanon and under thethreat that another American, Joseph James Cicippio, would beexecuted.   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the meetingwas ``primarily informational and assessing the information that wehave (and) knowledge that we would like to have.'' It was Bush'ssecond meeting in less than 24 hours with top advisers.   Cicippio's captors extended the deadline for his execution by 48hours, to Thursday. It was not known if the message to Iran had anyinfluence on that decision. A deadline set by kidnappers of Britishhostage Terry Waite passed with no immediate word from them.   Although the White House said there was ``no directconfirmation'' of Higgins' death, Bush made a telephone call toPope John Paul II to ask his intercession to seek the return ofHiggins' body as a humanitarian gesture, Fitzwater said.   The press secretary said the president and the pope, in a12-minute call, also discussed the situation in Lebanon, theescalation of the fighting amid intense shelling and the difficultyof the Arab League's peace efforts.   Officials said the United States also sent a strongly wordedmessage to Iran on behalf of the hostages. ``We expect those whohave influence over the hostage takers to exert that influence,''said one official, who spoke on condition that he not be identified.   Asked if Iran had intervened to win the 48-hour reprieve forCicippio, the official said, ``You could speculate it was perhapsthrough Iran's intervention but it could have been through Syria'sintervention or somebody else's intervention or it could have beennone of the above.''   Fitzwater said, ``We sent all the countries of the region thesame kind of message privately that we sent them publicly.'' Hesaid there was no special appeal to Iran beyond that. Since theUnited States does not have diplomatic relations with Iran, theSwiss government serves as a conduit.   Bush also called Prime Minister Turgut Ozal of Turkey. Fitzwatersaid Bush's strategy was ``to stay alert to opportunities, beconstantly assessing the situation and talk to a lot of people,involve a lot of people'' to help the hostages.   Trying to dispel any notion of a White House gripped by crisis,Bush went ahead with plans to entertain members of Congress at aTexas-style barbecue on the White House South Lawn with countrymusic by the Oak Ridge Boys.   Alluding to the hostage crisis as he thanked the band and hisguests, Bush said, ``These are not easy days either in the Congressor in the White House.   ``There are overwhelming events that concern everybody here,''Bush said. ``But even though there are complicated times, I thinkan evening like this of just plain relaxation with friends is verysignificant and very important.'' The audience applauded.   On Capitol Hill, there was renewed debate about the decision ofthe Israeli government to kidnap the Moslem cleric Abdul KarimObeid. His seizure last Friday triggered the latest hostage crisis.   Diplomatic sources said the United States cautioned Israelagainst taking any precipitous action that might endanger thehostages.   Amid apprehension over the hostages' plight, the United Statespressed a diplomatic campaign for the release of all Americancaptives in Lebanon, appealing for help from Saudi Arabia and otherArab governments as well as the Soviet Union.   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, who was visitingTehran, and other Soviet officials acceded to U.S. requests thatMoscow use its growing influence in Iran on behalf of the hostages.   Higgins' wife, Robin, said in Washington through a spokeswomanit was impossible to determine from a videotape released by thekidnappers whether it was her husband who was shown hanging, boundand gagged.   She called on his captors ``to give us proof of his condition. Iwant my husband returned home.''   Fitzwater said the administration was relying largely on pressreports about the hostages, and he called the news ``troublesomeand very discouraging to us as we follow this situation.''   He said Bush ``has expressed his personal outrage and openly hastalked about the frustration in dealing with this kind ofsituation.''   Other than Higgins, there are eight American hostages held inLebanon, including Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondentfor The Associated Press.   Stephen Studdert, a senior presidential assistant, said Bush wasconcerned ``that every military option ... has with it thepossibility that those sites may be a place where American or, inthe case of Terry Waite, British hostages are held.''   Studdert said White House chief of staff John Sununu discussed``the constraints of military options'' at some length during amorning staff meeting.   Hinting against any imminent action, Fitzwater said he wanted toemphasize ``the importance that everyone acknowledges in taking thetime to fully ascertain the facts, to give a thorough assessment ofthe situation, to coordinate and diplomatically contact our alliesand anyone else who has information on these kinds of issues and togenerally give the matter a very thorough kind of assessment.''   The crisis ``has not preoccupied the government on a fultimebasis,'' said Fitzwater.   ``We do not want to portray a crisis atmosphere but we do wantto portray one of concern and one in which the government sharesthe concern of the American people for its citizens held hostage,''Fitzwater said.   Former hostage David Jacobsen said Tuesday that his sources inLondon told him American hostage Anderson was to have been releasedlast Saturday, but that the Israeli action put an end to the talk.   ``There was enough of a feeling that with the new leader in Iranthat perhaps he might want to reach some kind of accommodation withthe West,'' Jacobsen said.   Observers in the Middle East and Washington, and Anderson'ssister Peggy Say, said they had heard no report about a pendingrelease.   In Congress on Tuesday, Senate Republican leader Bob Dole ofKansas said, ``Today, I am not happy that one of our closest andmost important allies, Israel, has also struck out alone,free-lancing, apparently in the interest of gaining leverage to winthe release of some of its citizens held hostage.''   Dole added that he did not blame Israel for Higgins' apparentdeath, saying instead that ``his blood is on the hands of theassassins.''   Some White House officials privately expressed irritation atIsrael, but Fitzwater publicly tried to take some of the sting outof the criticism.   ``Israel is a strong ally of the United States,'' Fitzwatersaid. ``We have an enduring and vibrant relationship and interestin continuing their security and that certainly has not changed andwill not change.''   While Israel has offered to swap Obeid for Israeli and Americanhostages in Lebanon, Fitzwater said, ``Our policy has been veryclear that we do not negotiate for the release of hostages.''   Israeli officials insisted that no pressure was being applied bythe United States for Israel to free Obeid.</TEXT></DOC>
