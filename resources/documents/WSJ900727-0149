For years, conspiracy theorists have hinted that themammoth securities houses that dominate trading on the TokyoStock Exchange routinely act in collusion with their majorclients. Until now, there had been little official supportfor such allegations.</LP><TEXT>   Yesterday, though, Japanese newspapers reported thatJapan's National Tax Agency allegedly discovered that about20 securities firms -- including two of the biggest, YamaichiSecurities Co. and Daiwa Securities Co. -- had paid more than16 billion yen ($106.7 million) in compensation to coverlosses logged by big customers in the 18 months through March31, 1989.   The Tokyo Tax Administration Bureau refused to comment onthe allegations, which were carried in articles in all themajor evening newspapers here. According to the newspapers,the authorities are seeking from the securities firms sevento eight billion yen in back taxes on the compensation. Theauthorities also are said to be continuing theirinvestigations at other houses, including the giants NikkoSecurities Co. and Nomura Securities Co.   Because the compensation that is paid should be reportedas profit by the securities firms -- such compensation isn'tpermitted under Japan's Securities and Exchange Law -- firmsthat made these payments without paying taxes on them firstcould be found to have violated the country's tax code andstill to owe back taxes on the money.   Both Daiwa and Yamaichi issued statements, denying theallegations. A spokesman for Daiwa said he couldn'tunderstand why the matter is surfacing now, as the companyalready has been audited for the tax year involved.   Still, this isn't the first time Daiwa has been charged inthis kind of case. Last year, the firm paid about 6.2 billionyen in back taxes on 10 billion yen in compensation it paidto some big institutional investors for losses they incurredduring the late 1970s.   In that instance, as well as in the latest alleged taxviolations, Japan's tax authorities have uncovered what fundmanagers have said in the past is a common practice in Japan:securities firms' guaranteeing returns for big investors.   Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's leading economic newspaper,said the securities firms compensated major clients forlosses by buying back from them, at a profit for the clients,bonds and other securities that the securities firmsinitially sold to those same clients at a discount. Thenewspaper said many major clients demanded such compensationafter the Black Monday stock market crash in October 1987.   This means the securities firms would have been takinglosses on such transactions to bolster their big clients.Small stockholders aren't given the opportunity to recouptheir losses in a similar way, and, analysts said,effectively lose on the deals because of the higher fees theymust eventually pay to cover the securities firms' costs.   &quot;They're discriminating against the individual,&quot; StuartMatthews, a financial analyst for Barclays de Zoete WeddSecurities Ltd., a British firm with offices in Tokyo, said.&quot;They're saving the big guys from harm.&quot;   The implications of the latest allegations against thesecurities firms are significant, Mr. Matthews said. &quot;Itraises the question of what the Japanese firms did after thecrash&quot; of share prices earlier this year in Tokyo, he said.&quot;Clearly, they allow their profits to leak away&quot; by payingthem out to clients.   Partly as a result of the newspaper reports, the shareprices of the Big Four Japanese securities houses fellyesterday. Daiwa shares fell 40 yen to 1,330 yen, Yamaichiwas off 60 at 1,120, Nikko was down 50 at 1,120, and Nomuralost 50 to 2,050.</TEXT></DOC>
