PLO officials said Arafat and Syriawould end their split.   Arafat, his leadership beset by the April 16 assassination ofhis deputy, Khalil Wazir, flew in from Libya and visited Wazir'sgrave.   Arafat's arrival in the Syrian capital capped a week-longmediation effort by Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi and AlgerianPresident Chadli Benjedid to heal the rift between the onetimeallies, PLO sources said on condition of anonymity.   Arafat's key political aide, Farouk Kaddoumi, also been workingon the reconciliation, conducting negotiations in Damascus sinceTuesday.   Arafat was accompanied by Salah Khalaf, who with Arafat andWazir founded the guerrilla's mainstream faction, Fatah. Lt. Col.Mustafa Kharroubi, a chief aide to Libyan leader Col. MoammarGadhafi, also was on the plane.   Asked if he would meet with President Hafez Assad, Arafat said,``God willing.''   Arafat and Khalaf drove to the Martyrs' Cemetry in Damascus'Yarmouk Palestinian refugee camp to pay tribute to Wazir.   Thousands of the camp's 220,000 refugees took to the streets towelcome the Palestinian leader. ``Blood and souls we sacrifice foryou, Abu Ammar,'' they chanted, invoking Arafat's nom de guerre.   The refugees surrounded Arafat's car and then lifted it off theground in an emotional demonstration of support.   Arafat was expelled from Syria five years ago during a bloodyfeud with Assad. He had been expected to surmount his disagreementswith Assad last week so he could fly to Damascus for Wazir's buriallast Wednesday, but that plan failed.   At least one PLO official said the imminent reconciliation wasdue to the death of Wazir, also known as Abu Jihad.   ``The martyrdom of Abu Jihad certainly pushed the reconciliationforward,'' Bassam Abu Sharif, Arafat's adviser, said in a telephoneinterview from Tunis.   ``Joining hands with our Syrian brothers is the response forIsrael's crime. Abu Jihad's blood is the bridge of unity for theforces fighting the Zionist occupation of Arab land,'' he said.   Indeed, Palestinian factions, divided since the PLO-Syrian rift,all denounced Wazir's killing and vowed revenge. They called forthe reunification within the PLO and a reconciliation with Syria asa response to Israel's apparent effort to weaken the movement.   Israeli military sources have said Wazir, 52, was gunned down inTunisia by a commando unit in a raid planned by Israel's Mossadintelligence agency. The Israeli government has not confirmed it.   Arafat flew into Damascus airport amid tight security. He wasmet at the plane by Interior Minister Mohammed Harba and SaeedHamadi, a member of the ruling Baath Party's regional command.   There was little ceremony at the airport.   Arafat is generally accorded a head-of-state welcome in Arabcountries, which regard the PLO as the sole representative of theworld's 5 million Palestinians. But the Syrian government reactedcautiously to Arafat's first visit to Damascus since he was kickedout June 24, 1983.   The PLO and Syria have been inching toward a rapprochement sinceArafat cut off relations with Egypt in April 1987 and pro-SyrianPLO factions made peace with Arafat's mainstream Fatah faction ofthe PLO.   Syria, spearhead of Arab radicalism, has refused to make up withEgypt until President Hosni Mubarak cancels the March 1979 peacetreaty that his predecessor, the late Anwar Sadat, signed withIsrael.   Syria and Arafat are adamantly opposed to separate peace dealswith Israel.   The Assad-Arafat feud erupted after Israel's invasion of Lebanonin 1982 and the consequent evacuation of the PLO from its powerbase in Beirut and south Lebanon.   Arafat at that time began looking into the prospects ofnegotiating peace with Israel.   That angered Assad and PLO radicals, who advocate armed struggleagainst Israel.   In May 1983, the friction exploded into an all-out battlebetween Arafat's supporters and Syrian-backed hardliners seeking tooust the guerrilla chief from the PLO leadership.   By December that year, the dissidents had overrun Arafat's basesin east and north Lebanon, forcing him to abandon his last Lebanesestrongholds.   By 1985, the PLO had slowly infiltrated back into Beirut andsouth Lebanon.   That prompted the Syrian-backed Shiite Moslem Amal movement inLebanon to attack Palestinian refugee camps.   The so-called ``war of the camps'' ended only three months agoas the PLO and Syria inched toward a settlement.</TEXT></DOC>
