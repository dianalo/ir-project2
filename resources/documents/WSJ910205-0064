Edwards andamp; Sons inSt. Louis. Financial issues had been heavily sold short byinvestors who expected the stocks to continue falling.

Individual investors have been actively buying OTC stocksfor a week or more, said Mr. Sulya and Ralph Costanza, headof OTC trading at Smith Barney. &quot;Probably one of the biggestthings that has characterized this move so far&quot; has beenparticipation among individual buyers, said Mr. Costanza.   Mr. Sulya added that the stock market's relentless marchupward startled him. &quot;There's nothing but negative news andthe market still rallies,&quot; he said.

The NASD said it is loosening restrictions on the system,which matches buyers and sellers in the private-placementmarket of unregistered securities issued mostly by foreigncompanies and nations. Portal volume has been tepid since itslaunch last year.   The NASD now plans to drop a couple of requirements thatdiscouraged use, such as requiring dealers to keep separateaccounts for Portal transactions and requiring NASDpre-approval of dealers' institutional customers. Under thenew rules, forwarded to the Securities and ExchangeCommission for approval, NASD member firms would only berequired to report Portal transactions to the NASD. But theywon't have to keep separate accounts or get approval of theircustomers from the NASD before using the system.</TEXT></DOC>
