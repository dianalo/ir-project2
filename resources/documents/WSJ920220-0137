She was kindlyand reliable in winter, always there with snow and ice forkiddies with new sleds and skates.   Not in this century. Ask Winter Olympians. From the firstWinter Games in 1924 to the present, Mother Nature has beenthe Mother of all Flakes, as unreliable as a spaced-out snowbunny with a noseful of greenhouse gasses and a brain riddledwith ozone holes. They call her Jinx -- short for WinterOlympics Jinx (WOJ).   Speedskating events were canceled at the 1928 games in St.Moritz, Switzerland. No ice. It was so warm the bobsled runmelted.   At Lake Placid, N.Y., in 1932, they had to import snowfrom Canada, and it didn't get cold enough to finish thebobsled runs until after the closing ceremonies. AtGarmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, in 1936, it was blizzards.The sun, in the 1956 Games at Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy,melted trucked-in snow. Skiing practice was canceled untilthey imported more. At Squaw Valley, Calif., in 1960, ablizzard ruined glitzy opening ceremonies planned by WaltDisney.   You get the drift.   This time around Ms. Nature first dumped a pasty, leadensnow cover on the French Alps, then warmed it with hot air,then rained on it. The result: slopes of ice. Then, over theweekend, she redeemed herself by dusting those slopes with 18inches of fine, light powder.   Nevertheless, modern Olympians don't trust her. They get alot of their snow, ice and even cold elsewhere. They have itcatered.   Olympians have skated on machine-made ice for decades. Andfor 20 years or so they have skied for the most part on fakeflakes. Many of them have grown up on it. The snow Ms. Naturelays down is often laboriously removed from slopes andconsigned to filler status around the edges. Some snow jockscan't stand the real thing: It's too wet, or too hard, or toobrittle or too inconsistent. Snowfall is one of the worstthings that can happen to bobsled and luge teams.   The chief ice and snow caterer for the AlbertvilleOlympics is York International Corp., the Fortune 500cold-air equipment giant that air-conditioned the U.S.Capitol, U.S. Navy Trident submarines, the World Trade Centerin New York, the British Parliament and the Kremlin. Itschillers are currently being installed in the Prophet'sMosque in the Saudi Arabian desert at Al Madinah, and in the31-mile-long Chunnel connecting England and France below theEnglish Channel.   If hell freezes over one day, a lot of people will bepointing the finger at York. For the 1988 Winter OlympicGames in Calgary, where warm &quot;Chinook&quot; winds threatened tobring summer early, York built a mile-long bobsled/luge trackthat stayed frozen when the air temperature reached 75degrees. This time out, however, York seems to be mimickingMs. Nature.   York, which is no relation to the barbell maker just downthe road from its corporate headquarters in York, Pa.,started in 1874 building machines to make blocks of ice foriceboxes. This beat sawing ice blocks out of lakes in thewinter. In 1903, they knew enough about ice-making to buildthe world's first artificial ice rink.   Today York has 11,000 employees with 27 subsidiaries in 18countries, and estimated 1991 revenue of $1.8 billion.According to Michael J. Ricci, director of corporatemarketing, roughly two-thirds of York's business isair-conditioning, and one-third is industrial refrigeration.   At various venues around Albertville, York systems makethe ice at four indoor rinks used in hockey, figure skatingand curling competitions, and the snow for 513 acres on thelower two-thirds of four ski slopes and the ski-jump site.Other firms froze the bobsled/luge track (Sabroe of Denmark)with huge cost overruns, and the disastrously half-frozenspeed-skating oval built by Stal of Sweden. York has thecontract to freeze them at the 1994 Winter Games inLillehammer, Norway.   No more of Longfellow's &quot;bosom of the Air&quot; snow. When rainturned downhill ski slopes to ice last week, York'scomputerized snow-making systems swung into action with theirsnow guns, motorized hydrants, weather stations,communication modules, and mouse-activated control computers,laying down a covering layer of fresh white.   &quot;Good morning, York automatic snow,&quot; says a cheeryreceptionist at the Englewood, Colo., branch of YorkInternational, whose French subsidiary, York France,installed the gear at Albertville. York bought the Frenchcompany, a snow-making specialist, in 1973. Since 1979 it hassold 132 turnkey systems to ski resorts in 10 countries.   Kevin Bergschneider, a product engineer, says that whilesnow-making has been around since 1950 it has really boomedin the past couple of years as ski-resort operators havesought insurance against Ms. Nature's fickleness. Two yearsago, Sun Valley plowed $8 million into York snow-makingequipment to ensure that reservations don't get canceled whenreal snow doesn't drop in. Fake flakes lengthen the season,too.   Actually, they aren't fake or artificial, says Mr.Bergschneider. He prefers the word &quot;man-made,&quot; whichdistinguishes them from experiments in indoor plastic flakesor materials other than frozen water. He notes that York'ssystem avoids the use of &quot;expensive chemical additives&quot; usedat some resorts to help the freezing process, or a livingbacteria that does the same thing.   Snow-making machines now dot 70% of the downhill ski runsin the U.S., according to the U.S. Ski IndustriesAssociation. In the East, fake snow is a virtual necessity.   Artificial ice comes in different temperatures, dependingon events. Speed skaters like &quot;sweaty ice&quot; at about 25degrees for less friction, but not the watery stuff they gotfrom Stal in Albertville. Hockey players, on the other hand,want 15-degree ice. And all skaters want consistency -- nobrittle patches here and wet spots there. York found a wetspot on its Meribel hockey rink, the result of a frozenevaporator coil, and mounted emergency repairs.   The curling rink at Prolagnan was even more embarrassingfor the firm. Its refrigeration system broke down when watergot into coolant coils. Only two of four curling &quot;sheets&quot; areusable, and the rink can't be fixed until the curlers gohome.</TEXT></DOC>
