The game of political one-upmanship escalated when Dukakis criedfoul over Bush's new attack strategy aimed at exposing theMassachusetts governor as a left-wing liberal.   Dukakis told reporters in Boston Friday that the vicepresident's game plan is ``a losing strategy.'' Bush, appearing ata Republican Party ``United '88'' conference here, retorted, ``Iwon't be deterred from telling the truth.''   While Bush and Dukakis engaged in long-distance insult-trading,setting a likely tone for the general election campaign between thetwo virtually certain nominees, Jesse Jackson was complaining thattoo much has been made of what he wants as the runner-up to Dukakisin the Democratic competition.   Jackson, taking a working vacation at a Southern Californiaresort, complained that such questions about his ambitions are``demeaning, disrespectful and contemptuous.''   And on Mackinac Island, Mich., Democrat platform writers voicedconfidence that the desires of both Dukakis and Jackson can beaccommodated. Party chairman Paul Kirk, however, warned againstproducing a document that would amount to ``the Yellow Pages _ anad for every organized group.''   Bush, chafing under heavy Dukakis criticism in recent weeksabout the vice president's performance in the Reaganadministration's handling of the drug problem, went on the attackThursday in a speech to the state Republican convention in Houston.   He charged Dukakis with concealing a leftist-leaning politicalorientation with ``moderate tones'' and with being born of the``Harvard Yard boutique'' school of liberalism.   Dukakis received an undergraduate degree in political sciencefrom Swarthmore before graduating from Harvard Law School. He alsohas many advisers with Harvard ties. Bush received an undergraduatedegree in political science from Yale.   Bush said Friday he wasn't making a class argument against theMassachusetts governor. Instead, he said, he was trying to say thatHarvard is ``a kind of philosophical enclave. ... I see this as aphilosophical cult normally identified with extremely liberalcauses.''   Yale, on the other hand, is ``so diffuse,'' he said. ``Thereisn't a symbol. ... Harvard boutique to me, at least, has theconnotation of liberalism and elitism.''   Dukakis refused to engage reporters in a discussion of hispolitical roots, although his campaign had said in advance of theBush speech Thursday that they expected a ``mudslinging'' strategyby the Republican.   Asked to respond Friday to Bush's attack, Dukakis said: ``Idon't. I'm going to campaign on the issues. I'm going to talk aboutthe future.''   Asked if he would bring up Bush's Yale background, the governorsaid: ``I'm really not interested. I don't think the Americanpeople are interested. I think it's a losing strategy.''   For his part, Bush was offering no apologies in his speechbefore the heavily partisan crowd of western state Republicans in aHyatt Regency Hotel ballroom.   He said that Dukakis and Jackson ``have been out there dumpingon me for six months. They can dish it out, but now let's see ifthey can take it.''   Four of Bush's vanquished GOP rivals shared the stage with thevice president, urging Republicans to unify behind the ticket thisfall.   Bush was warmly greeted by Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole,R-Kan., Rep. Jack Kemp, R-N.Y., former Delaware Gov. Pete du Pontand former Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. Pat Robertsonsent a letter saying he could not make the meeting, but that hethought Bush had ``earned and deserves'' the support of hisconservative followers.   Said Haig: ``Michael Dukakis is a candidate of radical anddangerous change. In Third World affairs, he is the reincarnationof George McGovern.''   Jackson told reporters in California he did not think hissupporters would turn away from the Democratic ticket if he is noton it.   ``They're not given to trauma easily,'' he said. ``Myconstituency will have a broad view of the many considerations.They do not have a fixation on one position. There is much to beconsidered.''</TEXT></DOC>
