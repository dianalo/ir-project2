Four months later, First Boston has slipped but is far from dead. Through the end of May, the company participated in deals totaling $38.7 billion, good enough to finish third among Wall Street's busiest merger experts in the first five months of 1988. And it topped the list in the sheer number of deals.    &quot;People say this place lost its talent, that it's in disarray,&quot; says First Boston's merger co-chief, James Maher. &quot;The facts are quite the opposite.&quot;    First Boston -- which has Wall Street's largest merger group, with about 160 investment bankers -- has survived with the help of a thriving merger market, the continued power of its reputation and a strange, symbiotic relationship that has developed with the startup firm of Wasserstein Perella andamp; Co.    Four months, of course, does not a future make. Just as strong merger groups aren't built overnight, neither do they fall apart in a short period. The question of whether First Boston can maintain its momentum is one that Wall Streeters may be asking for some time to come.    A big part of its continued success is simply inertia: Many of its recent deals were initiated under Mr. Wasserstein's reign. On the other hand, First Boston's battle tactics, with a few notable exceptions, have been less than stellar; several clients it defended succumbed easily to hostile tender offers. The company also has lost sole control of several crucial clients, and it isn't adding many new ones without Mr. Perella, who is considered a wizard at getting new business.    Also, more clients are splitting business -- and fees -- between First Boston and the Wasserstein firm, a practice encouraged by Mr. Wasserstein and fueled by First Boston's aggressive use of its own capital.    &quot;Clients simply find it easier to use both, saying in effect, 'why change, we're using the same firm'&quot; as before, says Stephen A. Schwarzman, president of Blackstone Group, an investment boutique competing for merger clients with both firms.    The continued success of its merger group could be crucial to First Boston's future. Takeover activity has accounted for as much as 30% of the company's profit. And any weakening in the merger group's performance could hurt First Boston's bargaining position in merger talks with its European partner and largest shareholder, Credit Suisse. Those talks are part of a wide-ranging discussion of possible restructuring measures going on between the two.    Perhaps the most intriguing element in First Boston's recovery is Wasserstein Perella's emerging role. Executives at both companies routinely bad-mouth their former workmates in private. But the two concerns need each other: First Boston needs client referrals from Mr. Wasserstein, while the Wasserstein firm needs First Boston's capital to make Mr. Wasserstein's complex strategies take form.    So far, First Boston has helped finance two of Wasserstein Perella's biggest deals -- Campeau Corp.'s $6.3 billion takeover of Federated Department Stores Inc. and Macmillan Inc.'s defensive restructuring. It's also financing Wasserstein Perella's first takeover of its own, the $1.2 billion acquisition with Henley Group Inc. of an IC Industries Inc. unit. Mr. Wasserstein encourages his clients to use both companies because he is comfortable working with his old charges and because First Boston represents less of a threat than other investment-banking firms.    &quot;They use us,&quot; First Boston's Mr. Maher counters, &quot;because in their heart of hearts, they know we're competent.&quot;    However profitable the relationship, it remains strained. In at least two cases -- Macmillan's restructuring and Tenneco Inc.'s proposed sale of oil properties -- the two concerns engaged in behind-the-scenes cat fights over who dreamed up the ideas. When a New York magazine confronted Wasserstein Perella with an as-yet-unpublished unflattering story about the new firm, Wasserstein Perella officials suspected First Boston of planting it. But when a Wasserstein Perella official appealed to Mr. Maher to plead their case to the magazine, Mr. Maher agreed.    No one took the departure of Messrs. Wasserstein and Perella harder than Mr. Maher, a former bicycle-parts salesman who spent his entire Wall Street career at the pair's side. He considered Mr. Perella, who had recruited him out of Columbia Business School, a father-confessor. And he respected Mr. Wasserstein's abilities, even though the two men sometimes didn't get along. For six months before the pair's departure, Mr. Maher had argued against breaking with the firm. &quot;It's not worth throwing away,&quot; he told the pair. &quot;You have a responsibility to the guys who stay behind.&quot;    When the two, over dinner at a Japanese restaurant, asked him to join their new firm, Mr. Maher declined. &quot;I spent 11 years with Bruce -- I didn't want to spend any more time in his shadow,&quot; he says today.    But if Mr. Maher wouldn't join his departing friends, neither would he stay at a rudderless First Boston merger group. He had no interest in picking up the pieces of a department he had worked 11 years to build. On the morning Messrs. Wasserstein and Perella handed in their resignations, Mr. Maher sat in his 42nd-floor office pondering his own. But First Boston officials pleaded with Mr. Maher to stay and share the department's helm with merger veteran Robert Cotter. As chaos enveloped the department, Mr. Maher considered the offer. Two hours later he accepted.    &quot;Anger at Bruce and Joe really wasn't a factor in my decision,&quot; he says. &quot;That came later.&quot;    Thus ensued a tug-of-war between the friends for who would control the brightest minds of Wall Street's biggest takeover group. At stake was the future of First Boston's mergers effort.    Mr. Wasserstein scored quickly, snapping up his closest advisers as well as a dozen sharp, young investment bankers. But Mr. Maher fought back with an intensity that surprised some of his colleagues. Armed with an easy-going, straight-forward manner, he worked 21-hour days twisting arms of undecided colleagues. His big break came when he retained for First Boston three key fence-sitters: Michael Koenike, head of First Boston's Chicago mergers efforts and a college chum of Mr. Wasserstein's; James Parkman, an energy specialist; and Gary Parr, head of First Boston's financial-services group.    First Boston also won the battle for Brian Finn, the 27-year-old whiz kid who heads First Boston's recapitalization and restructuring effort. The previous summer, Mr. Finn had agreed to leave First Boston with Mr. Wasserstein when the merger chief got into an earlier snit with First Boston managers -- an unpublicized episode First Boston insiders refer to as &quot;Muppet Caper I.&quot; This time, Mr. Finn wavered. After he had tentatively agreed to join Mr. Wasserstein, Mr. Maher talked him into staying during a long evening in which the pair drained a bottle of gin.    &quot;It was a difficult, painful situation for me,&quot; says Mr. Finn. &quot;But at the end of the day, I wasn't ready to kick Jim when he was down.&quot;    The split's impact was felt immediately. Several big clients, such as investor Ronald Perelman and Henley Group Inc., continued working with Mr. Wasserstein at his new firm; others, such as Farmers Group Inc., hired additional bankers to augment First Boston teams. Aggressive competitors such as Shearson Lehman and Blackstone Group began actively wooing First Boston clients.    In one regard, First Boston was lucky that Mr. Wasserstein's departure came during a huge wave of merger activity. The company was involved in a number of high-profile takeovers, most notably Campeau's run at Federated. Those battles ensured that big fees would keep coming in, and they provided a sense of momentum that the damaged concern badly needed.    Mr. Maher, who moved into Mr. Perella's old office, scored a morale-boosting victory in March when he headed Kelso andamp; Co.'s last-minute rescue of American Standard Inc. from a takeover attempt. Another First Boston deal maker snatched away a big Merrill Lnch andamp; Co. client, the publisher Grolier Inc.; Merrill was so mad it sued.    But competitors crowed when three First Boston clients, including Grolier, succumbed to hostile takeovers. In none of the cases were First Boston deal makers able to implement an alternative to the bid, a strategy considered critical to remaining independent or, at the very least, forcing a higher bid.    A recapitalization plan crafted by Mr. Finn for Koppers Co. was rejected by the company management after a critical part fell through at the last minute; Koppers subsequently agreed to be acquired by its suitor, Beazer PLC. A similar First Boston plan was rejected by Staley Continental Inc. in its unsuccessful defense against Tate andamp; Lyle PLC. Wall Street sources say Grolier never planned to seriously fight an unsolicited overture from Hachette S.A.    &quot;When we were there, you'd never see things like that,&quot; maintains a Wasserstein Perella banker. &quot;It doesn't look good, but nobody at First Boston seems to care as long as the fees keep rolling in.&quot;    In all three cases, the companies were sold for hefty prices to persistent corporate buyers. &quot;We're not fighting corporate raiders anymore -- today you're up against corporate buyers who really want to buy what they're after,&quot; says Mr. Maher. &quot;If the hostile bidder is willing to pay the price, then he'll win at the end of the day.&quot;    It's a strategy Bruce Wasserstein would scoff at. And auctioning off one's clients isn't the best way to build a business. But so far it has helped pile up fees and maintained a high profile for a merger group that was declared dead by many a scant four months ago.    ---                    The Top Deal Makers       Standings of the leading firms through May 31*                                     1/01/88 to 5/31/88                                 ------------------------- FINANCIAL                               AMOUNT    NO.
