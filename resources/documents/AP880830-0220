The Aug. 29 edition of Investment Dealers' Digest says the HouseEnergy and Commerce committee's oversight and investigationssubcommittee will hold a hearing Sept. 8 and reveal the findings,which indicate the Wall Street firms failed to detect suspicioustrades coming from the Ellis A.G. brokerage.   The weekly publication said the questionable trades covered asmany as 100 takeover deals from 1982 to 1985.   Under Swiss bank secrecy laws, trades executed by a Swissbanking firm through other entities, such as U.S. investment firms,don't have to be identified. This means someone holding an accountthrough a Swiss firm can trade through the U.S. markets withoutfear of detection.   The Investment Dealers Digest quoted unidentified congressionalaides as saying that in some cases, large trades from A.G. Elliswere spread out over a range of Wall Street firms in order to makethe transactions less obvious.   It said the repeated pattern of stock trades up to and during atakeover attempt, however, prompted congressional suspicion ofinsider trading, the misuse of confidential information, such asimpending takeovers, to profit in the securities markets.   The subcommittee has been looking for evidence that thesurveillance systems of Wall Street firms are inadequate, whichsome lawmakers say justify legislation that would increase firmliability in insider trading cases.   Ellis has been the focus of U.S. and Swiss law enforcementinvestigations for months, though no action has been brought so farand the sources behind the questionable trades haven't beendetermined.   The congressional probe was prompted partly by testimony fromconvicted insider trader Dennis B. Levine, who traded through BankLeu, a Swiss bank, as a way to hide his activities.</TEXT></DOC>
