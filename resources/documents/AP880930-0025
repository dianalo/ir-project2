The explosion probably ruptured pipelines carrying hydrocarbongases, setting off a series of blasts and fires that incineratedthe Piper Alpha rig owned by Los Angeles-based Occidental PetroleumCorp., said the report released by the Department of Energy onThursday.   The first explosions aboard Piper Alpha just before 10 p.m. July6 seem to have severed electrical power and disabled control andcommunications facilities, the report said.   Three-quarters of the platform sank to the ocean floor 120 milesoff Scotland's eastern coast, trapping many of the victims. Twowould-be rescuers were among the dead.   The Department of Energy's director of safety, Jim Petrie, whois heading the technical inquiry into the disaster, announced thatsafety regulations for oil rig operators would be tightened.   Among areas that needed closer attention were oil companies'technical procedures for dealing with oilfield emergencies, andtheir firefighting and evacuation systems, he said.   The government recommended last month that additional safetyvalves be installed on offshore oil and gas rigs to disconnect theflow of fuel to work areas in the event of an explosion.   Currently, there are no regulations concerning the locations ofvalves, although all rigs have some types of valves.   Most of the 120 men still missing are believed to have beentrapped in the sunken living quarters. Occidental Petroleum said ithopes to lift the accommodation modules to the surface early nextmonth.   A public inquiry will open Nov. 11 in Aberdeen, Scotland, andthe technical inquiry will continue separately ``as long as it'snecessary to get to the facts,'' said a Department of Energyspokesman.   ``This is not the final report and much remains to be done,''said Energy Secretary Cecil Parkinson. ``A number of studies havebeen commissioned and the results are yet to be received.   The opposition Labor Party's spokesman on energy, John Prescott,said safety legislation, rather than voluntary agreements with oilcompanies, was needed urgently.   ``The offshore oil industry is the most dangerous industry inBritain,'' he charged. ``Its safety standards are being compromisedto maximize production and profit.''</TEXT></DOC>
