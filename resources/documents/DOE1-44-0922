Trends are towards an increase in longwall mining, automation,remote control and robotics. Developments in continuous miners, conveyors,ploughs and shearer loaders for high production are described. The useof powered supports in changed roof support design is discussed, as wellas the design of the latest roadheading and tunnelling equipment. Thediscussion continues in the area of remote control and automation withthe monitoring of mine environment, problems of remote control of longwallmining, mine-wide monitoring for improved management, improvements inutilisation, performance and reliability of machinery and health monitoringsystems. The application of computer technology is emphasised and futuredevelopments outlined. 1 fig., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
