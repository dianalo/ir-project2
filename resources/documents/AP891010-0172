The four-day congress that ended Monday overwhelmingly approveda new party line calling for ``a constitutional state based on amultiparty system where the source of the power is the will of thepeople expressed in free elections.''   It adopted a manifesto pledging commitment to democracy and abreak with the Leninist mold. But still unclear is whether the newparty will divest itself of all remnants of Communist rule, and howfast.   The congress elected Rezsoe Nyers, formerly Communist Partychairman, as president of the new party. It named a 25-memberpresidium, where reformers are in the majority.   Imre Pozsgay, a key reformer on the presidium, had complaintsabout the new party, Hungarian radio said Tuesday. It quoted him assaying in an interview with a Finnish newspaper that ``too manydifferences among the reformers'' exist.   The opposition initially reacted to the new party withskepticism, and some people privately said they were not impressedby the change because economic problems persist.   Speaking at a rally of about 600 people Tuesday, Nyersacknowledged that the new party had image problems. ``Some stillfeel that the Communists are incapable of democratization,'' heconceded.   He told reporters later that ``major changes are required forthe party to win the people's trust.''   In his speech, Nyers said three issues divided the party: partychapters at the workplace, the workers' militia, and the assets ofthe disbanded party.   Radical reformers demand ending party representation at theworkplace and abolishing the workers' militia, an armed unit of theold party now likely to come under army control.   Nyers said some delegates to the congress felt the new partyshould not accept the assets of the old. But he said that wouldhave made the new party ``poorer than the Hungarian DemocraticForum, the largest independent opposition party.''   Zoltan Biro of the Democratic Forum expressed skepticism aboutthe political changes.   ``I do not consider fortunate the agreement between the variousforces, although I am glad that the left wing of the party, whichdoes not wish to accept democracy, cannot feel at home in thissuccessor party,'' Biro told the Mai Nap newspaper.   He was apparently referring to the congress' decision to rejectradical reformers' demands that diehard Marxists be shut out of theparty.   ``The best solution would have been a clear split, with the leftwing of the party going off on its own,'' Biro was quoted assaying. ``Judging by the composition of the presidium, such a splitshould not be ruled out.''   ``We suspect that no essential change occurred'' at the partycongress, said Tibor Vidos of the opposition Free Democrats.   ``Despite the role of the platforms, the real decisions weremade in camera by the platform leaders. We fear that this partywill remain a source of instability in the country.''   Zoltan Rockenbauer, a leader of the League of Young Democrats,said he believed unity was achieved at the congress throughcompromise on the part of radical reformers and could lead to ``thenew party's loss of credibility in the public view.''   A Budapest taxi driver said: ``They can talk till they drop. AllI know is that I work 14 hours a day to feed my two kids.''   Political observers here agree effective dismantling ofCommunist control is a long-term task.   To achieve credibility before elections to be held by next June,the new party will have to relinquish its hold on the media,dissolve the workers' militia, surrender its privileges anddissolve its chapters at the workplace.   It will have to open its books, turn its assets over to thegovernment and have them shared at least in part by the newpolitical parties.   The Ferenc Muennich Society, a hard-line Communist group, saidit will discuss its future Wednesday.   On Monday, the Marxist Unity Platform, another conservativegroup, said the old Communist Party remained functional and urgedtrue Communists not to join the new one.</TEXT></DOC>
