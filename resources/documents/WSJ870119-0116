Boesky Corp. to the Los Angeles-based securities firm of Jefferies andamp; Co., part of what may be a pattern of suspicious payments by Ivan F. Boesky, is being examined by the Securities and Exchange Commission in its investigation of the insider-trading scandal, sources familiar with the investigation said.    Meanwhile, the lawyer for the limited partners who invested in Ivan F. Boesky andamp; Co., a second Boesky concern formed last March, said that he and his staff are investigating a number of large payments made by the Boesky corporation to others at about the time of the partnership offering.    As for Jefferies, it received a $3 million check from Ivan F. Boesky Corp. dated April 1985, lawyers and others familiar with the SEC probe said. At about that time, a Jefferies official in New York prepared an invoice in that amount for what were described as &quot;investment advisory services,&quot; the sources said, adding that the invoice listed a handful of companies on which Jefferies stated that it had done research. Preparation of the invoice &quot;was a rush job,&quot; said one source familiar with the transaction.    The payment, as well as a later $5.3 million payment from the Boesky company to Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., also purportedly for research and consulting, is being examined by the SEC to see if it was exchanged for inside information or was otherwise improper, the sources said.    Frank E. Baxter, president of Jefferies, would say only, &quot;We think we have provided all the information the SEC has asked for, and that information has nothing to do with insider trading.&quot; Drexel has confirmed that a payment was made and said it was for investment-banking services, but declined further comment.    SEC officials declined to comment.    Harvey Pitt, a lawyer for Mr. Boesky, said, &quot;I'm really not at liberty to comment on what people may speculate are the concerns of the SEC.&quot;    As previously reported, Mr. Boesky gave differing explanations of Drexel's $5.3 million fee to his staff, characterizing it first as trading commissions and later, when questioned by his auditors, as consulting fees. The fee to Drexel was paid in March 1986, when Ivan F. Boesky Corp. was dissolved and Mr. Boesky started the investment partnership; both entities primarily speculated in takeover stocks.    Neither Jefferies nor Drexel would specify the work performed in return for the fees. But other sources questioned the size of the payments. According to people familiar with the Boesky company's operations, the company typically paid securities firms for research by giving them orders that generated trading commissions. Other investment bankers said payments of that size for research would be extraordinary.    As previously reported, Drexel is the target of an SEC investigation growing out of the Boesky scandal and is also under investigation by a federal grand jury. Drexel officials and Jefferies andamp; Co. have been subpoenaed by the SEC. Neither firm has been charged with any wrongdoing.    The former Jefferies official who prepared the $3 million invoice, Michael Singer, has also been subpoenaed. He resigned from his position at Salomon Brothers Inc. shortly after the Boesky scandal was made public. Sources familiar with the investigation have said that Mr. Singer isn't suspected of any wrongdoing and was simply carrying out orders when he prepared the bill.    Mr. Singer didn't return phone calls, and his lawyer, Alan Kaufman, declined to comment.    Robert Gargill, the lawyer for the Ivan F. Boesky andamp; Co. limited partners, and his staff at the Boston firm of Choate, Hall andamp; Stewart are including the $5.3 million payment to Drexel among the Boesky corporation payments that Mr. Gargill said they are investigating. He declined to elaborate, but said the investigation could lead to civil lawsuits on behalf of the limited partners if evidence suggests they were misled about the assets and liabilities that were transferred from Ivan F. Boesky Corp. to the limited partnership at the time of the partnership offering.    Mr. Gargill said he hasn't yet asked Drexel for detailed information about the work that was performed in return for the fee from Mr. Boesky, but said &quot;we plan to find out what really happened.&quot;    As previously reported, the $5.3 million Drexel fee came to the attention of auditors last March, who asked Mr. Boesky for documentation to support the payment. When he couldn't provide any, Drexel prepared a letter -- that was signed by two Drexel officials, Lowell Milken and Donald Balser -- saying the firm had performed &quot;consulting and advisory services,&quot; which the firm didn't otherwise identify. </TEXT></DOC>
