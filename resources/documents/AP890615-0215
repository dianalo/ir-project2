In the 1990s and beyond, know-how and inventiveness will emergeas the keys to success in every field, from selling hamburgers tofighting wars to forging steel.   The emergence of a knowledge-based world economy will create newwinners. But it also will create new losers: people, companies andcountries that can't find a place in a world moving beneath theirfeet.   Associated Press writers from around the country found that thedawning knowledge economy is remaking societies and shifting thebalance of global power. Those who exploit the trend are riding itto success. Those who do not are getting run over.   ``What we've had is a change in rewards for different kinds ofskills. You could think of it as brain power vs. muscle power, orpaper-and-pencil skills vs. other skills,'' says Harvard economistRichard B. Freeman.   Knowledge is not only power, it is money, and the erosion ofAmerican living standards directly reflects how the United Statesmay be losing its postwar domination in the global knowledge game.   American earnings have stagnated and even fallen. If you're a30-year-old with a college degree, you're making no more than yourcounterpart a decade ago after discounting for inflation. If youdon't have a college education, you're making thousands of dollars ayear less, says economist Frank Levy of the University of Maryland.   Perhaps more importantly, the knowledge-money connection iswidening the gap between rich and poor, aggravating class tensionsand leading indirectly to rising crime and drug abuse.   Harvard MBA grads can still walk into a $75,000-a-year juniorinvestment banker's life on Wall Street. But burgeoning illiteracyrates are leaving many youngsters with the feeling they have onlytwo choices: take a $3.35-an-hour dishwasher's job or peddle drugsand risk jail.   The demand for knowledge permeates every aspect of life.   When Michael Jackson brings in laser technicians for hisconcerts, he is plugging into the knowledge economy.   So is Jesus Frias, who consults computer-generated personalprofiles when he counsels crack addicts in Brooklyn.   So are the Iowans who make Gummi Bear candies for a West Germancompany that set up shop in Creston, Iowa, to take advantage of aninnovative job training program.   The potency of knowledge helps explain a lot of today'sheadlines, from the crackdown on China's student-led democracymovement, to the surge in lawsuits over copyrights, to congressionalopposition to the FSX fighter deal with Japan.   All around the world, the struggle for power is becoming a battleof wits. In the Soviet Union, President Mikhail Gorbachev ispressing for glasnost and perestroika out of an awareness that hiseconomic push will fail unless he can unlock the imaginations of theRussian people.   In Armonk, N.Y., International Business Machines Corp. isspending $900 million a year _ slightly more than the annual budgetof Harvard University _ to educate and train employees in everythingfrom robotics to public speaking.   In Miami's troubled Liberty City, Frederick Morley is trying toprepare the predominantly black, poor students of Drew ElementarySchool for a high-tech world that threatens to trap them in poverty.   ``The way out is education, literacy and skills. I think they'relistening,'' the principal says.   The quintessential product of the new era, software, is nothingbut a language of encoded knowledge, traveling freely betweencomputers. Economic visionaries say the people who can parlay theirthoughts into this language hold the key to the creativity that willshape our future.   ``The major `capital' of the next century is going to be mindsthat produce ideas,'' Alan Greenspan, chairman of the FederalReserve, said in a recent speech to American and Japanese executives.   The brains-over-brawn trend is hardly new, of course: FrancisBacon observed in 1597 that knowledge is power. What's new is thattechnology has made knowledge more mobile and infinitely more potent.   In the past year, fiber-optic cables that carry information atthe speed of light have been laid across the Atlantic and Pacificoceans for the first time. It's now possible for Soviet scientiststo plug directly into U.S. scientific data networks by computer.   Literacy rates have leaped in many developing countries, allowingthem to absorb technology quickly from the big industrial economies.   Knowledge has become the great equalizer, making it possible foranyone, anywhere, to compete and succeed. Unlike oil, timber ornuclear bombs, knowledge can be created and spread on a blackboardwith a stub of chalk, in Bangkok, Thailand, as easily as in Omaha,Neb.   In 1866, international communication was only for the elite. Itcost $100 to send a 20-word cable from New York to London on thefirst undersea cable. Today it costs $1 to send about 4,000 wordsover the same route using an ordinary personal computer and modem.   Japan's rise to power from a string of rocky islands is the bestevidence that a nation does not need amber waves of grain to make itin the age of the knowledge economy.   Conversely, Alaskans have discovered since the Exxon Valdez spillthe frailty of an economy built on natural resources, largely oil,fish and wilderness beauty.   The knowledge economy poses challenges at all levels of society _for governments, businesses and individuals. For the U.S.government, it is a question of focusing on the big picture,long-range strategists say.   To some people, that means industrial planning and initiativessuch as Sematech, the government-industry program in Austin, Texas,to restore competitiveness in computer chip manufacturing.   People like Kathryn Harrigan, a professor at Columbia University,say preserving American expertise should be a central objective ofU.S. trade policy.   Let foreigners buy as many high-tech U.S. companies as they want,so long as Americans are guaranteed the intellectually demandingjobs, she says. In a war, she says, the U.S. government always couldnationalize the companies.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
