The Secretaryof Energy's action was required by the provisions of section 170(B) ofthe Atomic Energy Act of 1954. That section requires the Secretary of Energyto request a section 232 investigation when imports of uranium representgreater than 37.5 percent of domestic requirements for any two consecutiveyears, as they did in 1986 and 1987. On February 27, 1989, the Departmentof Commerce announced its initiation of an investigation, and solicitedpublic comments in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4>On September 26, 1989, the Secretary of Commerce submitted his investigationreport to the President. The investigation determined that available suppliesof uranium would be sufficient to meet anticipated requirements duringa national security emergency. The Department found, therefore, that uraniumis not being imported in such quantities or under such circumstances asto represent a threat to the national security. On October 16, 1989, thePresident approved the Secretary of Commerce's recommended finding thatno Presidential action is necessary to adjust imports of uranium underauthority of section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended.The Executive Summary of Commerce's September 1989 section 232 report isreproduced below. The complete Commerce report is available for publicreview and duplication in the Bureau of Export Administration's Officeof Security and Management Support, Room 4886, U.S. Department of Commerce,Washington, DC 20230, (202) 377-2593.<ITAG tagnum="6">Dennis Kloske,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Under Secretary for Export Administration.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Summary</ITAG>BackgroundOn December 30, 1988, the Secretary of Energy requested the Secretary ofCommerce to conduct an investigation under section 232 of the Trade ExpansionAct of 1962, as amended, to determine the effects of uranium imports onthe national security. Under the statute, the President has the authorityto ``adjust imports'' based on recommendations from the Secretary of Commerce.The Secretary of Energy's request for the investigation was required bysection 170(B) (42 U.S.C. 2210b) of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. Thissection requires the Secretary of Energy to determine whether: (1) Executedcontracts or options for uranium from foreign sources for use within theUnited States represent greater than 37.5 percent of actual or projecteddomestic uranium requirements for any two consecutive year periods, orwhether (2) the level of contract or options from foreign sources may threatento impair the national security. If either determination is made, the Secretaryof Energy is required to request the Secretary of Commerce to initiatea section 232 investigation of uranium imports. Since U.S. utilities imported43.8 percent of their uranium requirements in 1986 and 51.1 percent in1987, the Secretary of Energy made the above determination and requestedthis study be initiated.The Significance of Uranium to National SecurityUranium is essential to the operation of the Navy's nuclear-powered fleet,for nuclear weapon capability and for civilian nuclear energy generation.As the essential fuel for the Navy's nuclear powered vessels, including150 nuclear submarines and surface ships, a guaranteed supply of uraniumis vital for the activities of the Navy. In addition, enriched uraniumis a key component of the Nation's nuclear weapons arsenal.In the essential civilian sector, nuclear power plants currently supplyalmost 20 percent of U.S. electricity requirements. In this respect, uraniumplays a critical role in the energy independence and security of the UnitedStates.Significant Industry TrendsInvestment as well as production of uranium has experienced a severe slow-downin recent years. Employment in the industry has declined from a 1979 peakof about 22,000 person-years and now stands at approximately 2,100 person-years.Prices have fluctuated continously since the beginning of the commercialmarket in 1964. In recent years, however, prices have experienced a sharpdownward trend.Exports have declined due to lower-cost competition in the world market.At the end of 1987, contracts committed 12.2 million pounds to be exportedby 1996 with no commitments beyond that date.Imports have increased to 51.1 percent of U.S. consumption in 1987 froma very low base as recently as the 1970s. Industry experts expect importsto increase in the near- to mid-term with most of the material coming fromCanada and Australia.CompetitivenessThe domestic industry's competitiveness has deteriorated in recent years,due to the easily accessible and richer deposits available elsewhere. Depositsin Canada contain up to 60 percent ore while commercially feasible minesin this country operate with deposits of less than one percent content.In addition, nuclear power has not been utilized to the extent predictedduring the early stages of the industry, resulting in lower demand foruranium to generate electricity. The U.S. market also suffers from inventoryoverhangs and market prices often lower than U.S. production costs.Supply Shortfall AnalysisIn a national security emergency, defense requirements could be met throughstockpiles of finished nuclear materials set aside for military needs.These could be supplemented by natural uranium held at Department of Energy(DOE) enrichment plants for defense needs. Civilian requirements couldbe sufficiently met through U.S. production, reliable imports, inventories,and tails reprocessing.FindingWe have determined that available supplies of uranium will be sufficientto meet anticipated requirements during a national security emergency.The Department, therefore, finds that uranium is not being imported insuch quantities or under such circumstances as to represent a threat tothe national security.RecommendationThe Department recommends that the President take no action to adjust importsunder authority of section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended.<ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-26369 Filed 11-8-89; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 3510-DT-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
