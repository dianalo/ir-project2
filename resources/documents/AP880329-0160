(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Surrogate mother Mary BethWhitehead-Gould testified Tuesday that both sides in the Baby Mcase should put aside their bitterness and let the child grow upknowing her birth mother.   ``Life is too short,'' said Mrs. Whitehead-Gould in the secondday of a visitation hearing. ``I don't know what life is going tobring. But there's a chance that she will never know me, that I'dnever know her.''   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould, 31, visibly pregnant in a blue and whitematernity dress, spoke calmly and quietly in 2{ hours of testimony.Her voice sometimes wavered, but she did did not cry.   The child's father, William Stern, and his wife Elizabeth, satgrim-faced through much of the testimony. Mrs. Stern smiledoccasionally, however, when Mrs. Whitehead-Gould spoke of themannerisms of the 2-year-old girl legally known as Melissa Stern.   The Sterns, who have custody of Melissa at their home inTenafly, in their testimony called Mrs. Whitehead-Gould a liar whocould undermine their relationship with the child and possiblyexploit the girl in the media.   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould, of East Brunswick, is seeking more liberalvisitation with Melissa. She wants to see the child two days a weekfor a total of 16 hours at her home immediately, with the scheduleeventually expanded to include overnight stays, half the summer andsome holidays.   The Sterns are seeking to have visitation cut off for severalyears, perhaps until the child is 9 or 10.   The hearing before Superior Court Judge Birger M. Sween wasordered by the New Jersey Supreme Court, which on Feb. 13 restoredMrs. Whiehead-Gould's parental rights but left intact a ruling thatgave custody to the Sterns.   Stern, a biochemist, and Mrs. Stern, a pediatrician, have saidthey turned to surrogacy because Mrs. Stern feared that her age andher mild form of multiple sclerosis would make pregnancy dangerous.Mrs. Stern is now 42.   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould agreed to bear them a child for $10,000 bybeing artificially inseminated with Stern's sperm. But when thebaby was born, she changed her mind, sparking the dispute.   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould, who has remarried and is pregnant with hercurrent husband's child, asked for reconciliation with the Sternsin the emotional tug-of-war over the child.   ``I'm willing to meet them more than half way,'' she said.   Much of Mrs. Whitehead-Gould's testimony answered charges madeby the Sterns.   She said she felt no anger toward the Sterns and did not blamethem, as Stern said Monday, for the breakup of her 14-year marriageto Richard Whitehead.   ``I let go of custody a long time ago,'' she said. ``I want tobe a mother. I want to share in raising her in any way I can. But Idon't want to undermine the Sterns in any way.''   She said that her current visitation schedule of two hours aweek under supervision wasn't ``meaningful.'' Mrs. Whitehead-Gouldsaid the child could benefit by contact with her new husband, NewYork City tax accountant Dean Gould, and her two children from herprevious marriage, Ryan, 13, and Tuesday, 12.</TEXT></DOC>
