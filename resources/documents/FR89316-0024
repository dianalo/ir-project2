The new section requires that no person shall store,sell or supply gasoline from a bulk plant or terminal having a Reid VaporPressure (RVP) greater than 9.0 pounds per square inch (psi) from May 1through September 15 beginning in 1989 and continuing each year thereafter.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>On November 12, 1987, the Commissioners of the Northeast States for CoordinatedAir Use Management (NESCAUM) signed a Memorandum of Understanding expressingtheir intention to reduce the Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP) of gasoline to10.0 pounds per square inch (psi) starting in the summer of 1988 and to9.0 psi in the summer of 1989 and continuing every ozone season thereafter.The State of Rhode Island held a hearing on April 18, 1988 on a regulationto implement this strategy. Since there were delays in adopting necessaryregulations, the 1988 limit of 10.0 psi has been eliminated and Rhode Islandis limiting RVP to 9.0 psi from May 1 to September 15 starting in 1989,and continuing each year thereafter. On November 10, 1988 Rhode Islandsubmitted a SIP revision to implement this provision to EPA for approval.EPA published a notice of proposed rulemaking on August 19, 1987 (52 FR31274) which would also require the control of RVP. The EPA proposal callsfor control of the volatility of gasoline nationally. In that notice, EPAproposed that in the Northeast the standard would be 10.5 psi from May16 to September 15 in the years 1989-1991 and 9.0 psi during the same timeperiod in 1992 and thereafter. One option EPA is currently consideringis taking final action now only on the 10.5 psi standard to be effectivebeginning in 1989 as an interim standard. The EPA regulation, when finalized,would normally preempt the state provision, under section 211(c)(4) ofthe Clean Air Act (the Act). However, section 211(c)(4)(C) of the Act providesfor approval of state control of fuel or fuel additives if the controlis part of the SIP and is necessary to achieve the primary or secondarynational ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) which the plan implements.<ITAG tagnum="84">Criteria for approval</ITAG>There are two different situations under which EPA might ultimately takefinal action on Rhode Island's RVP regulation: (1) If EPA has not takenfinal action on its proposed RVP regulations so that there is no federalpreemption of state regulation; or (2) if EPA has taken final action andthere is federal preemption. Either situation could occur within the timeframe anticipated for final EPA approval of this SIP revision. Section 211(c)(4)(A) of the Act, in describing federal preemption authority,states:<ITAG tagnum="21">``Except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (B) or (C), no State(or political subdivision thereof) may prescribe or attempt to enforce,for the purposes of motor vehicle emission control, any control or prohibitionrespecting use of a fuel or fuel additive in a motor vehicle or motor vehicleengine_(i) if the Administrator has found that no control or prohibitionunder paragraph (1) is necessary and has published his finding in the <T4>Federal Register, </T4>or (ii) if the Administrator has prescribedunder paragraph (1) a control prohibition applicable to such fuel or fueladditive, unless [the] State prohibition or control is identical to theprohibition or control prescribed by the Administrator.''</ITAG>For the reasons described below, we do not believe this section of theAct preempts approval of the Rhode Island revision. First, EPA has notmade the finding described in subparagraph (i) of paragraph (A), that nofuel control or prohibition under paragraph (1) of section 211(c) is necessary;and EPA clearly has not published any such findings in the <T4>Federal Register. </T4>In fact EPA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking(52 FR 31274) on August 19, 1987 which, when finalized, would control RVP.But this proposed federal RVP control is not yet final. Therefore, preemptionhas not yet occurred, and DEM is free to adopt and enforce its own RVPcontrols at this time.\1\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ One court, in <T3>Exxon v. City of New York, </T3>548 F.2d 1088 (2d Cir. 1977), has suggestedthat EPA's regulation of the lead content of gasoline amounts under subparagraph(ii) to the preemption of State controls of any aspect of the content ofgasoline (unless identical to the federal lead content control). EPA doesnot agree with that holding and hence does not believe that the reasoningof the decision should apply in cases involving state fuel regulationsother than regulation of lead content. Second, even if preemption were to occur, EPA may still approve certainstate provisions for limits on RVP of fuel where it can make a findingunder section 211(c)(4)(C) which would authorize EPA approval and, thus,eliminate the preemption problem. As set forth below, section 211(c)(4)(C)authorizes EPA to approve into the SIP a state-adopted fuel control measurethat has otherwise been preempted by final EPA action if EPA finds thatthe state control ``is necessary to achieve'' the standard that the SIPimplements. Section 211(c)(4)(C) of the Act, in setting forth the circumstances underwhich an exception to federal preemption of state regulation may occur,states:<ITAG tagnum="21">``A State may prescribe and enforce, for purposes of motor vehicleemission control, a control or prohibition respecting the use of a fuelor fuel additive in a motor vehicle or motor vehicle engine if an applicableimplementation plan for such State under section 110 so provides. The administratormay approve such provision in an implementation plan, or promulgate animplementation plan containing such a provision, only if he finds thatthe State control or prohibition is necessary to achieve the national primaryor secondary ambient air quality standard which the plan implements.''</ITAG>In the <T4>Federal Register</T4> discussion of EPA's approval of a state oxygenatedfuels program in the Maricopa country, Arizona SIP, EPA interpreted thislanguage as requiring the Agency to find that a fuel control requirementwas essential to achieve timely attainment of the standard. EPA said furtherthat a fuel control measure may be ``necessary'' for timely attainmentif no other measures that would bring about timely attainment exist, orif such other measures exist and are technically possible to implement,but are unreasonable or impracticable. Otherwise, no fuel control wouldever be ``necessary,'' since for any area there is at least one measure_namely,required shutdowns and prohibitions on driving_that would result in timelyattainment of the NAAQS. It is doubtful that Congress would have intendedto bar EPA from approving State fuel controls into a SIP based on the availabilityof such drastic alternatives.\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ <T4>Federal Register </T4>August 10, 1988, 53 FR 30220, 30228.<ITAG tagnum="84">Evaluation of How the Rhode Island Revision Satisfies the ``Necessary''Criterion</ITAG>The Rhode Island submitted and related documents contain the state's analysisof the emissions reductions that various measures would achieve and theremaining shortfall needed to achieve attainment. That analysis concludesthat the Rhode Island RVP regulation would reduce VOC emissions by an estimated2458 tons per year (TPY). The quantity of reduction was derived from AP-42emission factors for storage and transfer of gasoline and from the EPAMOBILE 3 emission factor model for motor vehicle emissions. This estimatemay understate the actual reductions because it does not include the emissionsreductions that would result from decreased running losses from motor vehiclesassociated with lower volatility gasoline. Running losses are emissionsfrom the gasoline tank and fuel system that occur while a car is beingdriven and which result from an overload of the evaporative control systemor escape through the filler cap.Information available in the Rhode Island SIP and supplemental inventoryinformation submitted by the state were used in making the following findings.The 1986 inventory shows that Rhode Island has achieved a 17% reductionof VOC emissions on a statewide basis from 1980 emissions. Based on EPA'sexperience with Regional Oxidant Model runs for 1980 it seems likely thata reduction on the order of at least 40% from 1980 levels is needed forattainment of the ozone standard. Under this scenario, the emission reductionfrom 1986 levels needed for attainment translates to at least a 28% reductionfrom the 1986 inventory.The VOC strategies identified by the RI DEM as having the greatest potentialfor significant future VOC reductions are:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,tp0,i1,s10,9,9</C><H1>Measure</H1><H1>Tons reduced </H1><H1>Percent of 86 inventory</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Enhanced I/M plus Basic I/M \1\<D>5014 TPY </D><D>5.1</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">RVP 11.5 to 9.0 psi<D>2458 TPY</D><D>2.5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Stage II Controls<D>1600 TPY</D><D>1.6</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Architectural Coatings<D>334 TPY</D><D>\2\ 0.3</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Consumer Solvents<D>280 TPY</D><D>\2\ 0.3</D><R>n,n,s</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">Total</ITAG><D/><D>9.8</D><F>\1\ Although Rhode Island's basic I/M program is not part of the SIPand does not meet EPA requirements, it can be modified to provide thesereductions. </F><F>\2\ These are emissions from the entire category and could probablynever he fully reduced due to the nature of available controls on thesearea sources. Many of these formulations cannot be fully reformulated orreplaced and, because they are area source emissions, cannot be effectivelycaptured and controlled.</F></ITAG>No other categories of available controls will individually yield reductionsof more than 0.3% of the 1986 inventory. The total of the available controlstrategies would yield approximately a 10% reduction if all controls were100% effective. This still leaves a VOC emission reduction shortfall ofapproximately 18%. Even if EPA does promulgate a RVP regulation requiringcontrol to 10.5 psi in 1989, the state regulation will still provide additionalreductions No other measures that are clearly reasonable for implementationin Rhode Island could provide sufficient reductions to achieve attainmentwithout the State RVP control. Thus, Rhode Island's RVP program appears to meet the appropriate test ofbeing ``Necessary'' to achieve attainment of the ozone standard. The factthat the state RVP regulation might not by itself fill the remaining shortfalland hence by itself achieve the standard does not mean the rule would notbe ``necessary'' to achieve the standard within the meaning of section211(c)(4)(C). EPA believes that if Congress intended EPA to approve a statefule-content rule only if it were necessary <T3>and sufficient</T3> to achieve the standard, then it would have usedthat language in sectin 211(c)(4)(C) EPA believes that the ``necessaryto achieve'' standard must be interpreted to apply to measures which areneeded to reduce ambient levels (thus bringing the area closer to achievingthe NAAQS) when no other reasonable measures are available to achieve thisreduction. A contrary application of ``necessary to achieve'' in this situationwould mean that measures which result in significantly improved air qualityare nonetheless unacceptable (even though no other reasonable measuresare available) just because they are insufficient to actually result inattainment. <ITAG tagnum="84">Enforceability </ITAG>EPA's review for the enforceability of the Rhode Island revision revealeda problem with the test methods section of Regulation Number 11. The staterequires that fuel sampling and testing shall be conducted in accordancewith ASTM method D323-58, which is acceptable to EPA, or ``* * * any othermethod approved by the Director.'' EPA has informed the state that alternativemethods must be approved by EPA as well. The state has committed to revisethis section of their regulation to resolve this problem. DEM may dropthe alternative method language or may require approval by EPA as well.EPA is proposing to approve the DEM's RVP controls with the understandingthat the state must revise the test methods section to cure the problemwith alternative test methods prior to final EPA action.<ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Action</ITAG>EPA is proposing to approve this revision to the Rhode Island ozone stateimplementation plan to control gasoline volatility with the understandingthat the state will revise the test method section of the regulation priorto final Agency action. EPA is also proposing to make a finding that thisSIP revision meets the requirements of section 211(c)(4)(C) of the Actfor an exception to federal preemption at such time as EPA promulgatesregulations to control the volatility of fuel. EPA's regulations were proposedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of August 19, 1987 (32 FR 31274).Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I certify that this SIP revision will not have asignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.(See 46 FR 8709.)The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof section 3 of Executive Order 12291.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 52</ITAG>Air pollution control, Hydrocarbons, Ozone.The Administrator's decision to approve or disapprove the plan revisionswill be based on whether it meets the requirements of sections 110(a)(2)(A)-(K),110(a)(3) and 211(c)(4)(C) of the Clean Air Act, as amended, and EPA regulationsin 40 CFR Part 51.
