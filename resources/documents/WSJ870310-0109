She eats hot dogs in big bites. She is a control freak. She is an enormously talented performer who pushes herself harder than anyone else could.    None of these &quot;revelations&quot; may sound terribly intimate, but Ms. Tomlin was offended enough by them to try to suppress the film. A Los Angeles judge rejected her plea to block distribution last summer. Now, film makers Nicholas Broomfield and Joan Churchill are distributing their documentary themselves. They've already opened the film in Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York and have booked theaters in cities around the country for release later this spring.    &quot;We were never involved in doing an expose,&quot; said Ms. Churchill in an interview. &quot;We wanted to make a film about the creative process.&quot;    And that is what they have made. It's hard for someone who isn't Lily Tomlin to understand what she objects to in this sensitive and sympathetic film. &quot;Lily Tomlin&quot; peeks very little into Ms. Tomlin's personal life. Its voyeurism is limited to her craft, how she molded the characters who ended up in her Tony-winning show, &quot;The Search for Signs of Intelligent Life in the Universe.&quot; The film makers traveled with her to Austin, Texas, to Atlanta, to San Diego, Santa Fe and other cities to record her &quot;work shows.&quot;    They show us bits of the shows peopled by Tomlin's poignant, satirical creations, and the planning that goes into her remarkable transformations. Now she's an overwrought teenager (&quot;My parents would take me to a fast-food restaurant and say: `EAT SLOWLY!'&quot;); now, she's a post-feminist est graduate, musing about underarm hair (&quot;I didn't know what it meant politically, but it sure had visual impact&quot;).    In between, they've inserted footage from early Tomlin, including her first TV appearance, wearing a brunette beehive and a va-va-voom minidress.    The film makers also sit in on Ms. Tomlin's interviews with overearnest newspaper reporters. They show her with her acting coach. They show us her assistant firmly informing someone on the phone that Lily finds a poster so unacceptable she wants copies of every slide from the film it was based on.    Her prima-donna streak crops up only once, when she steps out of her car carrying her dog in her arms and snaps out an order. Yet later, on her way to her opening-night performance on Broadway, she seeks comfort from the limousine driver.    Ms. Tomlin agreed in 1983 to let Ms. Churchill and Mr. Broomfield's camera record her as she tried out new material on the road. She was familiar with their work, which included &quot;Soldier Girls,&quot; a documentary about women in the military.    They caught her at a vulnerable moment. Her career was stalled, and &quot;All of Me,&quot; in which she co-starred with Steve Martin, wouldn't become a hit until 18 months later.    So, on and off over the next two years the film makers kept their video cameras turned on while Ms. Tomlin munched hot dogs backstage, performed, took comments from audiences, went over scripts with her collaborator Jane Wagner.    Ms. Tomlin won't talk about the film or how she felt while it was being made. The film makers say they all became friends. &quot;It was quite extraordinary being around this woman who's such a genius,&quot; said Ms. Churchill. &quot;We'd fly together, stay at the same hotels, some of them fleabag dumps. We'd eat together.&quot;    None of them realized then that the show she was putting together while they were filming would turn out to be one of the big hits of Broadway's 1985 fall season. But it certainly was by the time Ms. Churchill and Mr. Broomfield screened the picture for Ms. Tomlin and Ms. Wagner the following spring. They say they allowed her to cut 20 sequences -- including many close-ups.    They next heard from her in court. In June Ms. Tomlin tried to stop distribution of the documentary with a lawsuit charging that the film would limit her cable rights and that it invaded her privacy. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Jack Newman rejected her motion, and commented that Ms. Tomlin &quot;is most favorably presented in all aspects of the film, including the close-ups.&quot;    That wasn't the end of the matter. Ms. Tomlin continues to seek $6.75 million in damages. Mr. Broomfield and Ms. Churchill have countersued for $11 million. Even now, said Ms. Churchill, &quot;We're puzzled. It isn't Lily Tomlin here. It's a whole machine -- agents and lawyers with dollar signs in their eyes.&quot; Meanwhile, the film rolls on. </TEXT></DOC>
