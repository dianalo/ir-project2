They took her to the home of two gang members, where they raped her, beat her, tortured her, burned her, starved her, and after 40 days of captivity, murdered her.    The boys then dumped her body in an oil drum, poured concrete over it and abandoned it in a vacant lot. Police only discovered the crime when one of the boys, under questioning about a petty theft, poured out the tale.    Then the police made another shocking discovery: The parents of two of the gang members knew the girl had been in their house. She sat at their dinner table at least once, police say, but they were too scared of their sons to intervene or even call the police.    Japanese were stunned by the crime, in much the same way Americans were by the recent incident in New York's Central Park in which a woman jogger was gang-raped and bludgeoned into a coma. And, because of a recent string of brutal crimes by juveniles, some here fear Japan has caught what they call the &quot;American disease.&quot;    &quot;You can see the society collapsing,&quot; says Susumu Oda, one of Japan's most prominent child psychiatrists. Echoes a headline in a weekly magazine: &quot;The Devil -- Children of the Comics and Video Age . . . U.S.-Style Violence, Will it Take Over Japan?&quot;    To Americans, beset by a burgeoning crime rate, the extent of Japanese concern about crime may seem curious. Japan's crime rate is the lowest of any industrialized nation. The murder rate is one-eighth that of the U.S., thefts about one-fourth. Most streets in Tokyo, a much bigger city than New York, are safe at night.    Moreover, the juvenile crime rate actually has fallen in recent years. But criminologists say that is because there are fewer juveniles in Japan's aging population. Juvenile crime tends to run in cycles, and when the cycle turns upward again, Japan could be in for unprecedented problems because juvenile crime has become more violent.    To the Japanese, their new delinquents resemble America's alienated youth of the 1950s -- whom Japanese know from movies such as &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot; and &quot;West Side Story.&quot;    If this &quot;American disease&quot; is untreated, some Japanese fear it is only a matter of time before Japan comes to resemble their vision of the U.S. -- a land of drugs, unemployment and crime.    Police note that gangsters from Hawaii, the Philippines and Taiwan are smuggling in more guns. And police report an &quot;Americanization&quot; of drug use. In 1988 they confiscated only half as many stimulants, which Japanese traditionally have used to stay awake at school or work, as in 1987, but five times as many &quot;recreational&quot; drugs such as marijuana and hashish. Japanese also cite the same factors some Americans blame for U.S. juvenile crime: broken homes or absent fathers, and violence in television and comic books.    &quot;Sooner or later,&quot; says Dr. Oda, &quot;what is happening in America will happen here, perhaps in a watered-down form.&quot;    Japanese say their fears are valid because the character of the crimes and the criminals is so different from the past. As evidence, they cite recent police investigations:    --Three junior-high school boys strangled a seven-year-old boy in his apartment. They waited for the boy's mother to return, then strangled her with a telephone cord.    --Two brothers, ages 14 and 15, played the children's game of rock-scissors-paper to decide who would kill their 66-year-old grandmother. They then killed her and stole her money.    --A teen gang abducted a young couple motoring in the countryside, forcing the husband to watch them rape his wife and then forcing the wife to watch them slit her husband's throat. They later killed the woman and dumped her body in the mountains.    --Youth gangs clashed not far from Tokyo Disneyland and a 17-year-old boy was stabbed to death.    --Teen motorcyclists beat a salaryman to death at a gas station with a metal tool box.    Psychologists who interview juvenile criminals say they notice a lack of feeling among such children toward others. &quot;How gruesome these incidents were and the lack of sympathy they evidenced shows how different they are from the past,&quot; says Masayuki Tamura, a psychologist with the National Research Institute of Police Science.    &quot;They are becoming more and more cold-blooded,&quot; says Dr. Oda. Adds Inspector Shigeru Morishita of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police juvenile section, &quot;They don't know the limits. They see crime as fun or play.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
