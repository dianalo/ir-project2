The election pits Rodrigo Borja, a law professor and leader ofthe Democratic Left party, against Abdala Bucaram, a fiery,foul-mouthed campaigner from the tough port city of Guayaquil.   Borja and Bucaram, leader of the populist Roldosista Party,qualified for the presidential runoff by coming in first and secondrespectively in a field of 10 candidates in Jan. 31 elections.Borja received 20 percent of the vote to Bucaram's 15 percent.   Newspapers have criticized the candidates for conducting acampaign of personal insults rather than debating the issues, andcampaign violence has left three men dead and more than a dozenwounded in clashes between armed bands of supporters.   ``For the love of God stop insulting one another,'' MonsignorBernardino Echeverria, a Roman Catholic leader, said in an appealto Bucaram and Borja.   Bucaram, the 36-year-old heir to a political dynasty of Lebaneseimmigrants who settled in Guayaquil, set the tone for the campaignby calling his foe a drunkard, drug addict and atheist. He alsoused street language to question Borja's virility.   Borja, a 52-year-old urbane politician from Quito, the highlandcapital, responded with insults of his own. He has accused Bucaramof having a ``whorehouse vocabulary'' and being a ``fascistignoramus.''   Borja's party, which espouses a social democratic ideology, isthe country's largest, and he is favored to win in most publicopinion polls. But political analysts say Bucaram cannot be countedout, noting that 25 percent of the voters were still undecided inthe final week of the campaign.   Borja has pledged to reverse Febres Cordero's free-marketeconomic policies and seek close ties to the non-aligned movement.   Bucaram, couching his campaign in appeals to the country'smillions of poor, has vowed to raise taxes on the rich and ``punishthe oligarchy.'' He has promised to provide free shoes to all poorchildren and has pledged to nearly double the monthly minimum wageto $55.   Bucaram is a former mayor of Guayaquil who gained a hugefollowing among slum dwellers by paving streets and providingdrinking water and other essential services to shantytowns.   ``A vote for me is the same as throwing excrement in the face ofthe oligarchy,'' he said throughout his campaign.   His opponents have accused him of making demagogic, inflammatoryappeals to the poor, and strong rumors have circulated for monthsthat he will be ousted in a military coup if elected.   This Colorado-sized nation of 10 million people returned todemocratic rule in 1979 after a decade of civilian and militarydictatorships.   Febres Cordero, whose four-year term ends in August, has had astormy relationship with the leftist and populist parties thatcontrolled congress. He had to put down a rebellion by an air forcecommander halfway through his presidency.   The candidate of his Social Christian Party fared poorly in theJanuary elections, coming in third. The poor showing was viewed asa sign of the low popularity of the government.   The economy shrank in 1987 by 3.5 percent, and inflation isexpected to climb to at least 50 percent this year, the highestlevel since 1983.   Febres Cordero's supporters blame the decline on the sharp dropin the price of oil, Ecuador's main source of income, and economicdamage from a devastating earthquake in March 1987.</TEXT></DOC>
