Since the fall of 1985, NMFS has been monitoring the status of the winter-runchinook salmon population in the Sacramento River, California, to determineif it qualified for addition to the list of threatened and endangered speciesunder the provisions of the ESA. Between 1967 and 1985 the run declinedfrom a 3-year (1967-1969) mean run size of nearly 84,000 fish to a 3-year(1983-1985) mean run size of 2,962 fish. However, the California Departmentof Fish and Game (CDFG) has estimated the 1989 return of winter-run chinooksalmon to the Sacramento River at about 500 fish. This is a decline ofover 75 percent below a consistent run size of 2,000 to 3,000 fish in recentyears. NMFS believes this is a precariously low run size, and that theprotection afforded by the Endangered Species Act, particularly the section7 consultation process, is needed immediately to ensure that the spawningand rearing habitat is maintained to maximize production from the fishthat spawn in 1989 and to ensure that Federal fishery management programsare providing protection to the population. Also, NMFS is designating as critical habitat the portion of the SacramentoRiver from Red Bluff Diversion Dam, Tehama County (River Mile 243) to KeswickDam, Shasta County (River Mile 302) including the adjacent riparian zones,the water in the river, and the river bottom for the winter-run. This sectionincludes the portion of the river in which suitable conditions can be maintainedfor spawning, incubating eggs, and rearing juvenile fish. During the 240 days this emergency rule is in effect, NMFS will publisha proposed and final rule (with comment periods) to add winter-run chinooksalmon to the list of threatened species and designate critical habitat.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>Winter-run chinook salmon in the Sacramento Riverare listed as threatened under the ESA and critical habitat is designatedeffective April 2, 1990.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: </T2>James H.

They return to the river almost exclusively as 3-year-oldfish, thus the population is composed of essentially 3-year classes whichare monitored by the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) as theymigrate through the fish ladders at Red Bluff Diversion Dam. On November 7, 1985, NMFS received a petition from the American FisheriesSociety (AFS) to list the winter-run of chinook salmon in the SacramentoRiver as a threatened species under the ESA. NMFS reviewed the petitionand determined that it contained substantial information indicating thatthe petitioned action might be warranted. On February 13, 1986, NMFS announced(51 FR 5391) its intention to conduct a review of the status of the runto determine whether listing was appropriate. The status review was based on a consideration of available informationon the run relative to the five criteria specified in section 4(a)(1) ofthe ESA and a consideration of the conservation efforts of the State ofCalifornia and Federal resource management agencies to restore the run,as required by section 4(b)(1)(A) of the ESA. Information was providedby the petitioner, the State, Federal agencies that affect the run or itshabitat, and the public. The results of the status review, along with theNotice of Determination, were published on February 27, 1987 (52 FR 6041).In the Notice of Determination, NMFS concluded that the Sacramento Riverwinter-run chinook was a species in the context of the ESA, recognizedthat the run had declined over a period of less than two decades, and wasapproaching a level below which genetic diversity might diminish. The primaryreasons for this decline were the construction and operation of Red BluffDiversion Dam and other human activities that had degraded spawning andrearing habitat in the Sacramento River to a point where productivity ofthe run declined. Based on its assessment that restoration and conservation efforts beingimplemented or planned by State and Federal resource management agenciesadequately provided for the rebuilding of the population, NOAA Fisheriesdecided not to list winter-run chinook in the Sacramento River as a threatenedspecies. Subsequent to this determination, these restoration actions wereincorporated in a Ten-point Winter-run Restoration Plan and implementedthrough a Cooperative Agreement signed by the CDFG, the Bureau of Reclamation(BR) in the Department of the Interior (DOI), the Fish and Wildlife Service(FWS) in DOI, and NMFS. The Restoration Plan is reviewed in NOAA Fisheries'original decision not to list the run (52 FR 6041) and again after a reconsiderationof that decision (53 FR 49722). The tasks expected to be of most immediate benefit to winter-run are raisingthe gates at Red Bluff Diversion Dam from December 1 through April 1 toallow free passage of winter-run to suitable spawning habitat and maintainingwater temperatures at levels below lethal limits in the reach of riverabove Red Bluff Diversion Dam used for spawning. In the spring of 1988, prevailing weather patterns indicated that the droughtconditions that had developed in the spring and summer of 1987 would persistthrough 1988. These conditions caused concern among the resource agenciesthat the conservation measures in place to enhance the run might not beadequate to address the adverse effects of anticipated drought conditions.Specifically, water forecasts indicated that river temperatures might reachlevels lethal to some developing winter-run eggs. Therefore, NMFS decidedto reconsider its decision not to list the run and to re-evaluate the adequacyof the Restoration Plan for protecting the run during drought conditions.On June 2, 1988, NMFS announced this decision and requested comments toensure that all information on the status of the run and factors affectingit was available for the reconsideration (53 FR 20155). NMFS reviewed the available information and found that the status of thewinter-run population had not changed since the original determinationnot to list the run as threatened. None of the comments received duringthe reconsideration provided substantial new information indicating listingwas necessary. Also, the Ten Point Winter-run Restoration Plan was beingimplemented, and unprecedented actions were being carried out to minimizethe adverse effects of the drought. On December 9, 1988, NMFS published its determination that the actionsof State and Federal agencies to restore the winter-run chinook salmonpopulation and its habitat adequately addressed the threats to the populationand that the population was not likely to become in danger of extinctionthroughout all or a significant portion of its range in the foreseeablefuture (53 FR 49722). At the time of NMFS' review of the status of the winter-run population,the CDFG was conducting an independent review pursuant to a petition forlisting the run under the State's Endangered Species Act. The CDFG concludedits review in February 1989, and recommended to the California Fish andGame Commission that the run not be listed because the restoration actionsunderway or planned for the future had a high probability of restoringthe run. For the water year beginning in October 1988, precipitation and runoffwere again below normal, and, in February 1989, the Bureau of Reclamation(BR) announced cuts of up to 50 percent in water supply for central valleywater contractors. However, heavy precipitation in March 1989 in the northernSacramento River drainage basin restored Lake Shasta storage equal to thestorage in October 1987. As a result of the heavy March rains, the BR wasable to increase water supplies to contractors and maintain sufficientstorage to manage water temperatures in the river. The BR was also ableto leave the gates at Red Bluff Diversion Dam out of the water two weeksbeyond the April 1 deadline agreed to in the Cooperative Agreement.Although this provided an additional two weeks of unrestricted access tosuitable spawning habitat, lower than expected returns of winter-run werein the river to benefit. For undetermined reasons, the 1989 run returnedat much lower levels than expected. The CDFG estimated the size of the1989 run at about 500 fish * * * roughly 75 percent below the expectedrun size. Since 1982, the run has varied at about a mean run size of 2,382fish, and resource agencies expected the 1989 run to be near that level.<ITAG tagnum="84">Reasons for Emergency Determination </ITAG>Based on the low return of fish in 1989 and because the U.S. Fish and WildlifeService's hatchery program (a task in the Ten-point Winter-run RestorationPlan) for augmenting natural production is developmental and not likelyto produce substantial numbers of juvenile fish for several years, theCDFG reversed its position and recommended at the May 1989 meeting of theCalifornia Fish and Game Commission that the Commission list the winter-runas a threatened species under the California Endangered Species Act. Afterconsidering the recommendation of the CDFG, the Commission voted to listthe run as endangered under State law. The State's administrative proceduresfor adding the run to the list will be completed in August 1989. NMFS believes the 1989 run size is dangerously low since it has estimatedthat a run size between 400 and 1,000 fish is necessary to maintain geneticdiversity in the winter-run population (52 FR 6041). If the returns forthe remaining 2 year classes in the population are as low, NMFS believesthe population will begin losing genetic diversity through genetic driftand inbreeding. Further, a small population is vulnerable to major lossesfrom random environmental events such as droughts and other climatic episodes.However, because the 1987 and 1988 year classes, which are currently inthe ocean, are expected to benefit from the Ten-point Winter-run RestorationPlan, NMFS does not believe that the winter-run currently is in dangerof extinction. Nevertheless, the run is likely to become endangered ifimmediate action is not taken to ensure that conditions are maintainedin the river for maximum production from the fish that successfully spawnin l989. Therefore, NOAA Fisheries believes that it is necessary to takethis emergency action to list winter-run chinook salmon in the SacramentoRiver as a threatened species. <ITAG tagnum="84">Available Conservation Measures </ITAG>Conservation measures provided to species that are listed as threatenedunder the ESA include recognition, recovery actions, implementation ofcertain protective measures, and designation and protection of criticalhabitat. One of the most useful protective measures is the section 7 consultationprocess which requires all Federal agencies to conduct conservation programsfor threatened and endangered species and to consult with NMFS concerningthe potential effects of their actions on species under NMFS' jurisdiction.As soon as this rule becomes effective, NMFS will initiate section 7 consultationswith the Federal agencies whose actions may affect the continued existenceof the winter-run or adversely modify or destroy its critical habitat.Those agencies include the Bureau of Reclamation regarding temperaturecontrol measures throughout the rearing phase of this year's class of winter-run,the Army Corps of Engineers on the effects of gravel mining operations,and the Pacific Fishery Management Council on the effects of sport andcommercial fishing. Also, NMFS will continue to coordinate management of this run and its habitatwith the State of California. The State's Endangered Species Act containsa provision for interagency consultation among State agencies similar tosection 7 of the Federal ESA. The CDFG will review impacts of State actionson the winter-run to see if there are actions beyond the Ten-point RestorationPlan that can be taken, and they will review the State's water projectfor opportunities for improved water conservation. In addition, they willreview their own sport and commercial fishing regulations to ensure thatthose fisheries do not jeopardize the continued existence of the winter-run.NMFS will also participate in the State's review of sport and commercialfishing regulations. NMFS is charged with implementing the Magnuson FisheriesConservation and Management Act (MFCMA) and publishes and administers regulationsto implement fishery management plans developed by Regional Fishery ManagementCouncils. Generally, inter-jurisdictional fisheries or fisheries that occurprimarily in Federal waters are candidates for management under the MFCMA.The Pacific salmon fisheries are such fisheries. The Pacific Fishery ManagementCouncil manages salmon fisheries off the coasts of Washington, Oregon,and California. Generally, the Council strives to manage the fishery byconsensus among the Federal and state fishery management agencies so thatstate regulations in state waters are consistent with Federal regulationsin Federal waters. NMFS expects consultations under the respective State and Federal lawsto produce a State/Federal regulatory regime that will ensure the winter-runpopulation is not adversely affected by sport or commercial fishing. Therefore,it is exempting fishermen, who incidentally take winter-run chinook salmonand who are fishing lawfully under State law or regulation or Federal regulationsunder the MFCMA, from the prohibition on taking winter-run chinook salmon.The incidental take of winter-run chinook in recreational and commercialfisheries is not believed to be a primary cause of their decline.However, NMFS retains its right and responsibility to exert Federal authorityin State waters in the event the State develops fishing regulations thatare less protective than is commensurate with the designation as a threatenedspecies under the Federal ESA. <ITAG tagnum="84">Critical Habitat </ITAG>Section 4(a)(3)(A) of the ESA includes the requirement that critical habitatbe designated concurrently with the determination that a species is anendangered species or is a threatened species. Therefore, as part of thisemergency rule, NOAA Fisheries is designating the portion of the SacramentoRiver between Red Bluff Diversion Dam, Tehama County (River Mile 243) andKeswick Dam, Shasta County (River Mile 302) including the adjacent riparianzones, the water in the river, and the river bottom as critical habitatfor the winter-run of chinook salmon. This portion of the river containsalmost all of the habitat in which winter-run can spawn successfully, ifwater management strategies for maintaining suitable temperatures are implemented,and habitat in which most juvenile winter-run will rear. Section 4(b)(2) requires that economic impacts of specifying an area ascritical habitat be considered in the process of designating critical habitat.NMFS is designating only that portion of the river that is necessary toensure the survival and development of spawned eggs and successful rearingof juveniles during the 240 days the emergency rule is in effect. Thisis the minimum amount of habitat that is necessary to ensure the continuedexistence of the species. During the development of the proposed rule,other alternatives for critical habitat designation will be consideredincluding habitat in which winter-run has spawned successfully during exceptionallygood water years. Only two Federal agencies, the Bureau of Reclamation and the Corps of Engineers,are expected to experience a direct economic impact from this 240-day emergencydesignation. However, individual customers of the BR may eventually becharged higher rates for power if water used to generate power is lostto maintain a certain water temperature in the area designated as criticalhabitat. During the time the emergency rule is in effect, the amount ofwater that can be made available for irrigation is not expected to be reduced.If additional water is needed to maintain a certain temperature in thecritical habitat area, it will be recovered downstream. <ITAG tagnum="84">Effects of Designating Critical Habitat </ITAG>Federal agencies conducting, authorizing, or funding actions will incuradditional administrative costs in evaluating the effects of their actionson critical habitat. This expense will be minimal since these agencieswill be reviewing these same actions to assess their effects on the continuedexistence of the species. The BR will be required to ensure that suitable water temperatures aremaintained in the portion of the critical habitat where spawning, egg development,and growth of juvenile fish are expected to occur. During the 1987-1988drought, the BR maintained, under the Cooperative Agreement, suitable watertemperatures between Keswick Dam and Cottonwood Creek (approximately 14river miles above Bend Bridge). Generally, about 80 percent of the runspawns above Cottonwood Creek. The major action implemented by the BR wasusing the low level outlet for releasing water from Shasta Lake. This wasdone for the first time in 1987 and again in 1988. Because the low leveloutlet is below the outlet that runs water to the powerhouse, it releasescold deep water during periods of the year when the powerhouse outlet isdraining warmer water nearer the surface. While the low level outlet releasescold water to the benefit of the winter-run, the water bypasses the powerhouse,and power can not be generated from the release of that water. BetweenJuly 21 and September 17, 1988, the BR released almost 400,000 acre-feetof water through the low level outlet at the expense of $3.65 million inforegone power revenues. However, this cost should not be attributed tothe designation of critical habitat because it would be incurred underthe Ten-Point Winter-run Restoration Plan and the Conservation Agreementto which the BR has already agreed. Since storage in Shasta Lake in March was equivalent to the level at thebeginning of the 1988 water year, NMFS expects the Bureau to use the lowlevel outlet again in 1989 to maintain suitable temperatures for developmentof eggs and fry throughout the stretch of the river designated as criticalhabitat. The 1988 cost provides an estimate of the expense that the BRwill incur in 1989 as a result of foregone power revenues. However, thiscost should not be attributed to the designation of critical habitat becauseit would be incurred under the Ten-point Winter-run Restoration Plan andthe Cooperative Agreement which the Bureau of Reclamation has agreed to.The BR is expected to raise the gates in the Red Bluff Diversion Dam onDecember 1, 1989, and keep them raised through April 1, 1990, consistentwith past performance under the Cooperative Agreement implementing theTen-point Winter-run Restoration Plan. This will facilitate passage ofjuvenile fish downstream in December and provide access for adults to criticalhabitat. Because this activity occurs during the non-irrigation season,it is not expected to affect agricultural operations that depend on waterdiverted at the Red Bluff Diversion Dam.Because the BR has been cooperating in the conservation of habitat by raisingthe gates at Red Bluff Diversion Dam and by maintaining suitable temperaturesand because failure to conduct these actions could adversely modify criticalhabitat, NMFS has determined that the economic impact of these actionsto the BR does not outweigh the benefits to be derived from implementingmeasures to conserve the winter-run's spawning habitat during the 240 daysthe emergency rule is in effect. Due to the emergency brought on by the low return of spawning adults in1989, there has not been an opportunity to complete a more detailed economicanalysis. Other Federal actions, such as consideration of the City of Redding'sFederal Energy Commission applications, are not likely to progress to thepoint that resources will be irreversibly or irretrievably committed duringthe 240 days this emergency rule is in effect. Therefore, these actionswere not considered in this brief economic assessment. A complete economic analysis of the impact of designating critical habitatwill be included in the proposed rule for listing this population as threatened.<ITAG tagnum="84">Classification </ITAG>Since the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, (Assistant Administrator)has determined that the present situation poses a significant risk to thewell-being of the Sacramento River winter-run chinook salmon, emergencyregulations can be issued under 16 U.S.C. 1533(b)(7). The Assistant Administrator finds that reasons justifying promulgationof this rule on an emergency basis make it impracticable and contrary tothe public interest to provide notice and opportunity for prior commentor to delay for 30 days its effective date under section 553(b) and (d)of the Administrative Procedure Act. This emergency rule is exempt from the normal review procedures of ExecutiveOrder 12291 as provided in section 8(a)(1) of that order. This rule isbeing reported to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget withan explanation of why it is not possible to follow the usual proceduresof that order. This rule does not contain a collection of information requirement forpurposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act. The Regulatory Flexibility Act does not apply to this rule, because asan emergency rule, it is issued without opportunity for prior public comment.Since notice and opportunity for comment are not required to be given undersection 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act, and since no other lawrequires that notice and opportunity for comment be given for this rule,under sections 603(a) and 604(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, noinitial or final regulatory flexibility analysis has been or will be prepared.<ITAG tagnum="84">National Environmental Policy Act </ITAG>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has determinedthat certain categories of its activities do not normally have the potentialfor a significant effect on the human environment and are, therefore, exemptfrom the requirement for preparation of either an environmental assessmentor an environmental impact statement (NOAA Directives Manual 02-10 5c(3)).Listing actions under section 4(a) of the ESA and designation of criticalhabitat are among those actions NOAA has determined are exempted (NOAADirectives Manual 02-l0 5c(3)(h)). The main environmental impact from thisemergency rule will be modification of water temperatures in the area designatedas critical habitat for the benefit of incubating winter-run eggs and developingyoung. This is not expected to produce a significant impact to the humanenvironment. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 50 CFR Parts 226 and 227 </ITAG>Designated critical habitat and threatened fish and wildlife.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: July 31, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James E.
