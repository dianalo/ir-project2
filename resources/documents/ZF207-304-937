Van NameandM;With almost 100 different boards available today, PC Ethernet cards havebecome commodities.andP;  While factors such as drivers and performance stilldifferentiate the many boards, price is now often the primary consideration.andM;A few years ago it was not unusual to pay $595 for an Ethernet board, whiletoday a number of vendors are selling them for less than $300.andM;''[Ethernet] LAN cards are following the same path as modems,'' said MitchellCipriano, director of marketing communications for Acer Technology Corp. inSan Jose, Calif.andP;  ''You can't get more basic than an Ethernet LAN card.''andM;A manufacturer of PC compatibles and peripherals, Acer offers its low-costEthernet LAN card in order to be a complete PC supplier, Cipriano said.andM;Many customers now demand complete solutions from their vendors, Ciprianosaid, and the growing importance of LANs makes supporting them crucial.andO;''The LAN card enables us to sell more PCs and offer a complete solution.andO;When it comes to support there is no finger pointing.andP;  We can offer aone-vendor solution.''andM;He predicts that many other vendors of PC-compatible systems will be addingEthernet boards to their option lists.andP;  ''You'll see all but some companiesoffering a complete line of components.''andM;LAN software vendor Novell Inc., of Provo, Utah, also sells Ethernet cardsbecause they promote the firm's main business -- selling its NetWare LANoperating system, not other hardware.andM;Darrell Evora, vice president of marketing for Novell's Enhancement ProductsDivision, said his division's goal is to ''sell hardware to enhance the salesof NetWare and LANs in general.andP;  We sell LAN hardware to sell our software.''andM;Novell has long championed lower-cost Ethernet boards and will continue to doso, Evora said.andP;  ''A year and a half ago, when we lowered the price to $395,people thought we were crazy.andP;  We want lower prices.andP;  We are committed tolowering costs.''andM;From Novell's perspective, Evora said, the lower the price of a LAN board thebetter, because cheaper LAN boards mean more potential NetWare customers.andO;''We like it when the cost of a connection is lower.andP;  With NetWare having 60to 70 percent of the LAN operating-system market, anything we can do to fuelthe LAN industry is to our advantage.''andM;As Ethernet boards become commodities, potential buyers can save money andchoose a vendor that suits their overall needs.andP;  They can also mix cards fromdifferent vendors.andM;Robert Cely, manager of technical support for Policy Management Systems ofColumbia, S.C., has been successfully using boards from different vendors forsome time.andP;  ''We use Ethernet cards from Novell and Western Digital,'' hesaid.andP;  ''They both seem to work fine.andP;  We haven't found much differencebetween them.''andM;Most LAN board vendors do not expect this trend to change.andP;  In fact, manyfeel that the price of Ethernet boards will continue to drop as LANs begin tocompete more directly with minicomputers.andM;Acer's Cipriano said that for LANs to be functional alternatives tominicomputers, they must have comparable per-seat costs.andP;  ''I think that itis important to reduce the cost of a workstation,'' he said.andP;  ''The LAN cardis a component of that workstation.andP;  As LANs compete with multiuser systems,the cost must be competitive.''andM;Novell's Evora believes the emergence of hardware-independent LAN operatingsystems has helped to push down Ethernet board prices.andP;  ''I think thatNetWare's approach to support the users' freedom of choice has helped makeboards a commodity.andP;  The user is the one who can integrate the component thathe views as the best for his environment.andP;  Part of that [freedom] is thatEthernet boards will come down in price.''andM;One engineering factor has contributed to the the boards' continued pricedecrease: the use of one of a small group of standard Ethernet chip sets,such as Intel Corp.'s three-chip set.andM;''Since all boards are based on similar chip sets,'' said Evora, ''they'rebound to compete on the basis of price.''andM;Despite the overall trend of Ethernet boards to become commodities, Acer'sCipriano believes that some factors still differentiate the boards.andM;Perhaps the most important of these factors, he said, is the quality of thedriver software for the boards.andM;''A lot of effort goes into the software driver,'' he said.andP;  ''We supplydrivers for Novell's NetWare.andP;  If it weren't for [hardware-independent LANoperating systems], it would be difficult to come out with a card.andP;  As anincreasing number of PCs in corporate America become connected, there will bemore universal driver sets and connections.''andM;----------Bill Catchings and Mark L.
