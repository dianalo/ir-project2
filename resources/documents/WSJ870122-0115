TaylorStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 01/22/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> ENVIRONMENT (ENV)CONGRESS (CNG)EXECUTIVE (EXE)ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Senate, signaling that another veto of the $20 billion Clean Water Act would be futile, rebuffed President Reagan's cheaper alternative by an 82-17 vote and re-approved the act he pocket-vetoed last year.    Final Senate approval came on a 93-6 vote. The House cleared the same measure by a 406-8 vote Jan. 8, and Democratic congressional leaders said they planned to send it to the White House last night.    White House officials have complained about the bill's cost but haven't indicated whether Mr. Reagan will sign it. The Environmental Protection Agency's administrator, Lee Thomas, is expected to urge signing the bill, if only because it appears almost certain that a veto will be overridden. But at Mr. Reagan's request, the Senate delayed its vote from last week so that any veto override wouldn't come before his State of the Union address next Tuesday.    Yesterday's action came despite a plea for the president's alternative from Minority Leader Robert Dole (R., Kan.). The water-act vote &quot;may set the tone for the votes of the next several months,&quot; he warned. &quot;We may not be able to turn down any other spending program in the foreseeable future.&quot;    The Reagan administration-proposed alternative would cut to $12 billion the $18 billion in the bill for sewer-construction projects through 1994. But even leading Republican lawmakers said the offer was too little, too late. Sen. John Chafee (R., R.I.) said $18 billion was only a small share of $75 billion needed for sewer projects.    The Senate's measure would provide $9.4 billion in direct sewer grants and place $8.6 billion in state revolving loan funds, which are intended to take over all future sewer-construction aid. It also would begin new programs to clean up lakes, estuaries, &quot;hot spots&quot; of toxic pollution, and pollution that washes off farms and city streets.    In debate yesterday, Sen. Dole argued that the bill's $400 million program against rainwater runoff pollution would become a system of &quot;federal land-use controls.&quot; But other senators contended that the program, which would have been eliminated in the president's bill, is badly needed.    Many communities are relying on funding in the bill to help them to meet the July 1, 1988, deadline for providing secondary, biological treatment of sewage.    The bill is backed by a powerful alliance of municipalities, construction companies and environmentalists. Rick Hind, a lobbyist for the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, called movement toward enactment of the bill &quot;a great way to start the year for environmental legislation.&quot; He suggested it would lend momentum to other environmental bills.    The Senate also approved a House-passed resolution clarifying a section in the bill that appeared to clear the way for four fertilizer plants in Louisiana to dump toxic gypsum into the Mississippi River. The resolution would give the Environmental Protection Agency and the state the authority to approve or block such dumping, which currently is banned. </TEXT></DOC>
