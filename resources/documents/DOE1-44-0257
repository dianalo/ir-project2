Technical assistance has been defined to include, butis not limited to &quot;...alternative technologies for low-level radioactivewaste disposal...&quot; Alternative technologies refer to low-level wastedisposal concepts other than traditional shallow-land burial. The DOEhas two ongoing technical assistance projects examining alternative technologiesfor low-level radioactive waste disposal. The first program is the developmentof a conceptual design report comparing six low-level waste disposalconcepts. The second technical assistance activity is the preparationof technical design reports evaluating licensing aspects of alternativetechnologies. This paper presents the status of each activity; it addressespreliminary results of the conceptual design report and information relatingto the technical design reports.</TEXT></DOC>
