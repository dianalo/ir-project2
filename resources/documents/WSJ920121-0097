Boris Yeltsin assuredRussians that they would not starve this winter. The West haschipped in with large-scale food aid, both from governmentsand private charities. But there is significant evidence thatthe former Soviet Union is flush with grain, if only Mr.Yeltsin can get at it.   On Nov. 30, the daily newspaper Izvestia published a tablelisting Western credits received over the previous 11 monthsfor the purchase of food. The U.S., the European Communityand Germany, separately from the EC, provided almost $8billion; six other countries gave $2 billion more. IvanSilayev, then chairman of the Inter-Republic EconomicCommittee, announced that those funds would buy some 50million metric tons of grain from the West as well as muchmore. In addition, according to the same source, thegovernment purchased 42 to 43 million metric tons of domesticgrain during 1991, which amounts to approximately eight ornine million metric tons above annual consumption by thepopulation in all 15 republics of the former Soviet Union.</LP><TEXT>   There are even more compelling reasons to believe thatRussia may be overflowing with grain. The &quot;granaries of themotherland&quot; -- the state storage facilities -- may hold hugequantities. According to some calculations, storage capacityexceeded 240 million metric tons in the early 1970s andincreased to 290 million metric tons by 1981, with a targetof 362 million metric tons by the end of that decade. Most ofthat has come from Western imports, about half from the U.S.A large part is stored in underground shelters designed towithstand a nuclear blast and fallout. University of NorthCarolina economist Steven Rosefielde has asserted that thesesupplies could feed the entire population of the formerU.S.S.R. for three years; it may actually be four.   Then there are special military-related peacetime stocks.Mr. Silayev revealed the existence of a Centralized FoodFund. Last year it added almost 14 million metric tons ofgrain to a stockpile that is large enough to feed the armedforces, Moscow and the so-called closed cities -- wherenuclear weapons and their components are manufactured -- incase of war. There are 87 such closed cities in Russia alone,each guarded by a regiment of Interior Ministry troops.   According to the most recent Soviet Military Encyclopedia,edited by former Chief of Staff Marshal Nikolai V. Ogarkov,state reserves include -- apart from food -- fuel, materiel,capital equipment, spare parts, and other supplies to fightand recover from a war.   Vitaly V. Shlykov, deputy chairman of the Russian DefenseCouncil, revealed on American television last fall that themilitary-industrial complex also stockpiles enough suppliesto last at least three months. These can be opened only onorders from the highest authority. Mr. Shlykov was quoted bythe Japanese newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun on Oct. 25 to theeffect that, if all materiel were transferred from such statereserves to defense plants, industrial production wouldincrease by 50%. This could mean that the stockpiles ofmateriel for the military-industrial base total more than 200billion rubles, or one-fourth of the current GNP.   As commander in chief, Mikhail Gorbachev must have knownabout these vast expenditures for backup supplies, which hadgrown from 4% of annual national income after World War II to5% or even 6% today. Such huge reserves would have permittedthe Red Army to fight for 90 days in Western Europe and 180days in China, according to one source.   The more important question now is whether Boris Yeltsinhas the same access to these stockpiles. In theory, heshould. His decree of Nov. 28, &quot;On Forming a System of RSFSRState Reserves,&quot; transferred operational management over suchfacilities and stocks from the former Soviet Union to theRussian government's jurisdiction. This included all&quot;territorial administrations, institutions, enterprises,bases, depots, and safe custody stores, with all materialassets from state and mobilization reserves . . .&quot;   The existence of these stocks may be the reason why Mr.Yeltsin seems so certain that Russians will not starve --provided that grain can be taken away from themilitary-industrial complex. He tried to convince the formerSupreme Soviet that this should be done and failed more thana year ago. Mr. Yeltsin will find it easier to open thesegranaries, and thereby demolish a vital part of the warmachine, if the grain actually is needed. Should the Westcontinue to send food, it will only help the old Sovietmilitary threat survive the death of the Soviet Union.   ---    Mr. Staar, a fellow at the Hoover Institution, served asU.S. ambassador to the Mutual and Balanced Force Reductionnegotiations in Vienna.</TEXT></DOC>
