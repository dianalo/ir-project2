Normal air is used as carrier gasand its emission of pollution is measured by means of a specially pretreatedthermal simiconductor detector. The entrance filter retains particularair impurities up to a size of 0.02 {mu}m. The filter can either be investigatedby conventional trace analysis techniques where the deposits are quantified,or the biological activity of the deposits can be determined by meansof the electron microscope and by immunohistochemical techniques. Anidentification of the radioactive contamination is also possible withsuitable detectors. The filters can be directly evaluated if the electronmicroscope is equipped with EDX or EELS and a supplementary apparatus.The concentrations of the gaseous, oxidable air contamination are determinedby means of a semiconductor detector. The entire conception of the measuringsystem allows a simple and mobile installation so that it is suited asa single or network system (computer network with an interface) for environmentaland biomonitoring.</TEXT></DOC>
