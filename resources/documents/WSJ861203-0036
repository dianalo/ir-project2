President Reagan's call for a special prosecutor to investigate the Iran arms sale helped bolster investor confidence, according to analysts. They said the action eased fears, especially among foreign investors, that the scandal would hamper the administration in carrying out fiscal and economic policy.    Prices of some Treasury bonds spurted about three-quarters of a point, or around $7.50 for each $1,000 face amount of securities. Investor optimism spilled over into other financial markets. In the stock market, the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged more than 43 points to close at 1955.57. More than 230 million shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange.    The U.S. dollar rose against most foreign currencies, snapping a string of several declines. Prices of precious metals plunged amid profit-taking from recent rallies.    Investors appear confident that a special prosecutor &quot;would help clear the air more quickly of the Iranian problem,&quot; said Richard B. Hoey, chief economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. Arnold X. Moskowitz, senior vice president and economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., agreed that investors seem to be &quot;giving the president the benefit of the doubt&quot; by &quot;putting aside&quot; the Iran issue in their investment decisions.    Many analysts predict the Federal Reserve System will drive down interest rates in the months ahead in an effort to stimulate faster economic growth. There's simply &quot;no momentum building in the economy,&quot; said Robert A. Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities Co. International.    The Commerce Department said its index of leading economic indicators rose an unexpectedly strong 0.6% in October. But the department lowered the indicator for the previous two months. &quot;The economy is turning in a mixed performance,&quot; said Lacy H. Hunt, chief economist at Carroll, McEntee andamp; McGinley Inc. &quot;Consumer spending appears to be declining, with auto sales being particularly soft.&quot;    The gross national product, the total output of goods and services, is expanding at about a 3% annual rate this quarter, Mr. Hunt estimated. That would be little changed from the 2.9% growth rate registered in the third quarter, after adjusting for inflation.    Mr. Moskowitz estimated the economy is growing at about a 3.5% to 4% annual rate this quarter. But he contends much of the growth comes from special factors, such as companies speeding up their capital spending to take advantage of the certain tax breaks before tougher federal tax rules take effect Jan. 1.    The fourth quarter &quot;is stealing sales from next year's first half,&quot; Mr. Moskowitz contended. He predicted GNP will grow at a lackluster 2% to 3% annual rate in the first six months of 1987.    Mr. Moskowitz also predicted the Fed will ease credit conditions aggressively early next year &quot;to try to stimulate the interest-sensitive sectors of the economy.&quot; He expects the Fed to cut its discount rate to 5% from 5 1/2% early in the year and follow with another cut, to 4 3/4%, within a month or two. The yield on 30-year Treasury bonds, now about 7 3/8%, will tumble to about 6% by mid-1987, he predicted.    Mr. Hoey of Drexel Burnham doubts the Fed will be that aggressive. He contends there's only a 50% chance of a discount rate cut in coming months, and then possibly to only 5 1/4%. The discount rate is the fee charged by the Fed on loans to banks and savings institutions.    The longer-term outlook for Fed policy is even more clouded, according to Mr. Hoey. He noted that Paul Volcker's term as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board expires next summer. If he isn't reappointed, it's anyone's guess what monetary policy will be like, he said, adding: &quot;It's one of those jobs where you don't know how well a man will do until he starts doing it.&quot;    A survey taken by Mr. Hoey shows that financial &quot;decision makers&quot; believe Manuel Johnson, the Fed's vice chairman, is the most likely to succeed Mr. Volcker. More than 19% of the 371 investment managers and analysts polled said Mr. Johnson would probably inherit the chairmanship.    But the survey indicated most investment officials would rather not have Mr. Johnson at the Fed's helm. More than 26% of those surveyed said they had the most confidence in Gerald Corrigan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Only 6.9% said they had the &quot;most confidence&quot; in Mr. Johnson. About 47% named Donald Regan, White House chief of staff, as the person they would have least confidence in as Fed chairman.    In the credit markets, the Treasury's 7 1/2% bonds due 2016 closed on some dealers' quotation sheets at 101 26/32 to yield 7.35%. That compared with Monday's close of 101 2/32, where the yield was 7.41%. The government's 7 1/4% notes due 1996 rose to 101 7/32 from 100 23/32, cutting the yield to 7.08% from 7.15%.    High-grade corporate bonds registered price gains of as much as half a point. But junk bonds, high-yield issues with low credit ratings, were little changed.    Among short-term securities, the Treasury's latest 26-week bill closed at 5.4% bid, unchanged from the average rate set at Monday's weekly auction. The bid on the latest 26-week bill declined to 5.43% from the auction average of 5.46%.    Yesterday's bond rally was aided by an injection of reserves by the Fed into the banking network. The move was designed to help alleviate certain seasonal strains on the banking system. In its action, the Fed bought securities from dealers, who agreed to buy them back today.    On the corporate front, several new issues were offered to investors yesterday. These included a two-part, $175 million offering by General Telephone Co. of California made through underwriters led by Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.    The General Telephone package consisted of $75 million of 7 3/4% first mortgage bonds due 1998 and $100 million of 8 5/8% first mortgage bonds due 2016. The 7 3/4% bonds were priced after auction at 98.75 to yield 7.91%, while the 8 5/8% bonds were priced at 98 to yield 8.815%. Both portions are rated double-A-3 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and double-A-minus by Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.    A $200 million issue of Manufacturers Hanover Corp. notes was offered through underwriters led by Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. The 7 3/4% notes were priced at 99.75 to yield 7.81% to maturity in 1991. They are rated single-A-3 by Moody's and single-A-plus by Sandamp;P.    Another Goldman Sachs group offered investors a $100 million issue of Times Mirror Co. notes due 1996. The 8% notes, which were priced at par, are rated single-A-1 by Moody's and single-A-plus by Sandamp;P.    In the municipal market, a $120 million offering of various purpose general obligation bonds by Illinois was given a warm reception by investors. By some estimates, only about $34 million of the bonds remained unsold among underwriters as of yesterday afternoon. A group led by First National Bank of Chicago priced the bonds after auction to yield from 3.60% in 1987 to 6.65% in 2011. The bonds are rated triple-A by Moody's and double-A-plus by Sandamp;P.    A group led by L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin tentatively priced a $300 million offering of home-purchase revenue bonds by the California Department of Veterans Affairs. Under the proposed terms, the issue would yield from 4.25% on bonds due in 1987 to 7.5% on those due in 2012. The issue is rated double-A by Sandamp;P.    Separately, underwriters led by Salomon Brothers Inc. lowered some yields and raised others on a $162.4 million offering of revenue refunding bonds by the New York State Dormitory Authority. Yields now range from 3.5% on bonds due in 1987 to 6.75% on those due in 2011. The issue originally had been priced to yield from 3.5% in 1987 to 6.68% in 2011.    A group led by PaineWebber Inc. raised yields on portions of an offering of about $134.6 million of general obligation refunding bonds by Florida for the Broward County Expressway Authority. The new scale calls for the issue to yield from 4% in 1988 to 6.9% in 2010. Under the original scale yields would have ranged from 4% in 1988 to 6.7% in 2014. The bonds are rated double-A by both Moody's and Sandamp;P. </TEXT></DOC>
