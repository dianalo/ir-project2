Manuel Antonio Noriega said Thursday thatU.S. officials were notified of the attempt and agreed to help,then caused a fatal delay.   Adela Bonilla de Giroldi, 36, took refuge at a U.S. base duringthe coup and later fled the country after her husband, Maj. MoisesGiroldi, was executed by Noriega loyalists.   On Oct. 1, two days before the coup, Mrs. Giroldi had a friendarrange a meeting with a U.S. army colonel at the friend's house toinform them and ask for help in isolating Noriega's downtownheadquarters.   ``What my husband wanted was for them to overfly (Panamanian)air force bases ... so that no one could leave,'' she said. ``Andalso to close off the roads'' around the headquarters.   The colonel made arrangements with two civilian-clad U.S.officials, who then met privately with her husband, she said. Afterthe meeting, without revealing details, her husband said everythinghad been agreed and that the coup would be Oct. 3, according toMrs. Giroldi, who did not attend the meeting.   ``My husband told me they made an agreement,'' she said. ``Hetold me there were no problems, we were going ahead, and thateverything would turn out well.''   The U.S. officials gave him a number, she said, telling him tocall them any time during the coup to request help.   But during the coup, when the rebels seized temporary control ofthe headquarters and imprisoned Noriega, her husband's ally, Capt.Javier Licona, had little success when he picked up the phone.   ``When the call was made to tell them that Capt. Licona wantedto talk to them, to report, they didn't believe the call,'' shesaid. ``He had to go to Fort Clayton to assure them he was himself.A lot of time was lost.''   By the time Licona reached the U.S. base and convinced them ofhis identity, he could no longer reach Giroldi. Noriegasympathizers apparently had retaken control of the headquarters.Because of the confusion, Licona survived, the highest-rankingofficer to do so, and is now in hiding in the United States.   Mrs. Giroldi, however, did not place all the blame on the UnitedStates. the worst betrayal came from other Panamanian officers,especially Maj. Federico Oleochoa, head of Battalion 2000, she said.   She said he intially cooperated with the coup, letting Licona goto Fort Clayton, then switched sides.   Mrs. Giroldi strongly disputed statements made by Noriega ininterviews published Thursday saying that the plotters had receivedlarge sums from the United States.   ``If they had paid the sum of $1 million, where is it?'' shesaid. She denied that any of the officers involved in the coup hadbeen promised money by her husband or the United States.</TEXT></DOC>
