The subsidies are paid on sales made under the exportenhancement program and ``they are the best way to deal with theEuropean Community subsidies,'' Yeutter told reporters after ameeting with Agriculture Minister Don Mazankowski. The ministershold several meetings every year.   Earlier this month, the United States announced the subsidizedsale of 300,000 tons of wheat to the Soviet Union. The sales couldeventually reach 1.5 million tons.   Canadian officials suggested the sale violated at least thespirit of an agreement by member countries of the General Agreementon Tariffs and Trade, or GATT as the international trade referee isusually called. The agreement covers principles for aninternational agriculture trade code.   The agreement called on members not to increase subsidized sales.   Yeutter said the United States ``doesn't like export subsidiesmore than anyone else. While we hope we'll be able to stop usingthem, we don't have a lot of choice for now but to live with them.Otherwise we would be handing all of the world trade to theEuropeans on a platter.''   Canada has been campaigning against subsidized sales of farmgoods because it can't afford to match the subsidies and becausethey tend to lower prices Canadian farmers can get for theirexports.   Mazankowski said he also raised objections to a newcountervailing duty on Canadian pork shipments to the United Statesand defended new Canadian import restrictions on ice cream andyogurt.   Mazankowski said he told Yeutter that the basis of the decisionto slap a duty on shipments of Canadian fresh, chilled and frozenpork goes against GATT principles.   Mazankowski said that if the duty isn't dropped, Canada willtake the case to GATT.</TEXT></DOC>
