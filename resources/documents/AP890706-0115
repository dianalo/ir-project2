U.S. District Judge Stanley Harris sentenced Richard Miller onhis guilty plea to conspiring to defraud the government by using thefoundation to finance the covert arms-supply operation when directU.S. military aid to the anti-leftist rebels was banned by Congress.   Harris also directed Miller to perform 120 hours of communityservice. He could have received up to five years in prison and a$250,000 fine.   Miller and Carl ``Spitz'' Channell, who is scheduled to besentenced Friday by Harris, each entered guilty pleas to theconspiracy charge nearly two years ago and cooperated withindependent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh's investigation of theIran-Contra affair.   They were the first defendants convicted as a result of Walsh'sinvestigation.   In pre-sentencing remarks, Miller told the judge, ``I let myguard down. It may have been blind patriotism, but that's noexcuse.'' Caught up in a cause he believed in, he said, ``I turned ablind eye to the excesses of others and I crossed the line myself.''   The guilty pleas by Miller and Channell were the basis of acharge that former White House aide Oliver L. North conspired withthem to illegally use the National Endowment for the Preservation ofLiberty to raise donations for a non-tax-exempt purpose.   The foundation, headed by Channell, used White House briefingsand meetings with then-President Reagan to help raise $10 millionfrom donors who included Texas billionaire Nelson Bunker Hunt.   North was cleared of the tax conspiracy charge by a jury thatconvicted him May 4 of trying to cover up the Iran-Contra affair andillegally accepting a home security system.   North was fined $150,000 on Wednesday by U.S. District JudgeGerhard A. Gesell and ordered to perform 1,200 hours of communityservice.   Miller testified that North let him take 10 percent of theprivate donations as his cut for raising money. Miller said Northgave him lists of weapons the Contras needed to use during hismeetings with potential donors.</TEXT></DOC>
