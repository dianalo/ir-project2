But what isn't clear is whether loyal ex-colleagues will followthe Pied Piper of junk bonds to his new firm _ and how long theventure will last with Milken facing a lengthy jail term.   Milken, 42, resigned Thursday after 19 years at Drexel, where hebegan a wildly successful career that helped reshape corporateAmerica in the 1980s through the pioneering use of low-gradesecurities called junk bonds.   Milken, who made a reported $550 million in 1987, said he isforming a consulting firm to assist companies that want to raisemoney to start up, grow or stay in business.   But he faces $1.85 billion in forfeitures of alleged illegalprofits and a lengthy jail term if convicted on a 98-count fraud andracketeering indictment, the government's largest securities crimeprosecution to date.   People involved in Milken's plans for the new firm, InternationalCapital Assets Group, said Milken does not intend to raid Drexel'sBeverly Hills, Calif., junk bond division, which he founded and ranuntil his March indictment.   The principals in the new firm, which now has a handful ofemployees and a temporary Los Angeles office, are not going to be``Drexel people,'' Milken associates said.   But Milken still commands tremendous loyalty among some key junkbond employees and Drexel clients, and no one is ruling outdefections. Milken associates did not release details on his plans,including whether an affiliated brokerage would be formed.   A Drexel official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said theWall Street giant does not anticipate conflicts with Milken's newfirm because it will not be in the brokerage business.   Under Drexel's still-to-be-approved settlement of civil insidertrading and other fraud charges with the Securities and ExchangeCommission, Drexel and its employees are barred from doing businesswith Milken, directly or indirectly.   The Drexel official said the provision likely will be reviewed ona case-by-case basis, so some contact between the New Yorkinvestment firm's clients and Milken may occur. For instance, Milkenmay be able to refer clients to Drexel and vice versa but notreceive any fees.   Milken's resignation ends the relationship between one of themost important financial players of the decade and the firm hehelped boost from a second-tier brokerage to the nation's fifthlargest.   ``Michael Milken made many important contributions to DrexelBurnham, and his resignation, although not unexpected, is a sadevent,'' Drexel stated. ``We wish him well in his new endeavor.''   Milken widely was credited with creating a $175 billion-a-yearjunk bond market. His pitchman sale of the bonds _ previously usedmainly by companies with low credit ratings _ helped fuel thedecade's corporate takeover mania by giving smaller companies andcorporate raiders a tool for financing growth, mergers and takeovers.   But the federal government alleges Milken used his powers throughDrexel to engage in a range of securities crimes, including schemeswith now-jailed stock speculator Ivan Boesky.   He also is accused of insider trading in a separate SEC lawsuit.No settlement has been reached and no trial scheduled in that case.   Milken had been on leave from Drexel since his criminalindictment. His brother, Lowell, who also was charged in the case,announced Thursday he was quitting the firm to return to practicinglaw.   ``I am naturally disappointed to be forced to leave Drexel aspart of the firm's settlement with the government, but I lookforward to the opportunity of helping people build companies,''Michael Milken said in a statement.   Milken joined Drexel full-time in 1970 after graduating from theUniversity of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. In 1978, he movedDrexel's junk bond division to Beverly Hills.   Milken's trial in federal court in Manhattan is set for nextMarch. He is free under a $700 million bond package.   Lawyers close to the case indicated Milken's decision to resignwas calculated. By quitting, Milken pre-empts the firm's agreementwith the SEC to dismiss him once the settlement is approved by afederal judge.   With Milken's resignation, lawyers may argue that parts of theDrexel pact are moot and mount further challenges. They also areexpected to challenge the provision barring Drexel and Milken fromdoing business with the same clients.</TEXT></DOC>
