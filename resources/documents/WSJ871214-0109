The insolvent Bohemian Savings andamp; Loan Association, St. Louis, was closed at a cost to the government's insurance fund of $90.1 million. Bohemian, a state-chartered stock institution, had $184.4 million in assets. The insured deposits were transferred to United Postal Savings Association, also based in St. Louis, which planned to reopen the four closed Bohemian offices today as new United Postal branches.    The Federal Home Loan Bank Board took over Bohemian in January 1986 in an attempt to preserve the eroding assets of the institution until a final resolution. The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., a unit of the Bank Board, has filed a lawsuit seeking $22 million in damages against Bohemian's former management; the suit includes allegations of fraud and excessive compensation.    Separately, the Bank Board arranged for investors represented by National Capital Group, Washington, D.C., to take over Surety Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, Morganton, N.C. The investors, who will pump $4.2 million of new capital into the insolvent thrift, will acquire its eight offices and most of its assets and liabilities, the Bank Board said. The failed institution had assets totaling $125.8 million. The thrift was scheduled to reopen today.    First Interstate Bank of Alaska, Anchorage, Alaska, was closed Friday, but its 18 offices were to reopen today as branches of National Bank of Alaska, also of Anchorage. The failed bank had assets of $37.4 million.    Also closed Friday was the Lewis andamp; Clark State Bank, Lake Oswego, Ore., which had assets of about $19 million. Its three offices were to reopen today as branches of Key Bank of Portland, Ore. </TEXT></DOC>
