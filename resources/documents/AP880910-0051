Officials at flood control centers told The Associated Pressthat flooding worsened in 12 districts where, earlier in the week,the water level of major rivers had been receding.   The floods have covered three-quarters of Bangladesh and leftone-fourth of its 110 million people homeless.   Dhaka newspapers put the death toll from flooding at 1,402. Thegovernment's count remained at 609 and is considered far too low.   The International Red Cross on Friday said the floods hadclaimed 637 lives.   Officials reported an outbreak of diarrhea in all areas affectedby the floods. By Friday evening at least 160,872 people had beenafflicted by the illness and 102 had died from it, the officialssaid.   In Dhaka, a city of 6 million, 21,412 new cases of diarrhea werereported Friday by the government health center.   The rains Friday and early today added to hardships alreadysuffered by millions living on roofs and treetops and huddledtogether in thousands of camps nationwide without safe drinkingwater, cooked food or medical care.   Health Ministry officials said 30,035 health workers wereworking around the clock to aid victims of water-borne diseases.The officials acknowledged, however, that there was not enoughmedicine to help all those affected by the flooding.   Millions of gallons of raw sewage and tons of garbage dumpedinto floodwaters in Dhaka posed a serious medical threat to thecapital's population, a senior official at the Dhaka MunicipalCorp. said. He said the Buriganga River, which carried all thecity's sewage, was now mixing with the floodwater.   Health officials have estimated that 40 million gallons of rawsewage a day are being dumped into stagnating floodwaters wherechildren swim for fun and adults wade to food markets and reliefcenters.   A senior official at the Agriculture Ministry said that ``if thewater does not recede in the next couple of days, most of the ricecrop will be damaged beyond any recovery.''   The government has 1.3 million tons of grain and has issued anappeal for 3 million tons to compensate for damage to the rice crop.</TEXT></DOC>
