It wasn't Ms. Upshaw's pure, alluring soprano. That was inplace. But in her half-dozen years before the public, this29-year-old artist, who won a Grammy this year for arecording of American music (&quot;Knoxville: Summer of 1915&quot;),has set an extremely high standard for herself. But at theFebruary recital, that freedom of sound, that warmth, thatessential Dawnness -- just weren't all there.</LP><TEXT>   Chalk one up to biology: Ms. Upshaw gave birth to herfirst child, Sarah, on Nov. 15 -- and was back on stage Jan.23.   Pregnancy, birth and the first weeks of motherhood can begrueling enough for women with desk jobs or no jobs at all.For singers, the physical and hormonal changes that affectthe voice and the career pressures that make it difficult tosay no to engagements during and just after pregnancy taketheir own special toll.   Of course, that doesn't stop singers from going back towork right away: There was the singer who did the Dance ofthe Seven Veils in &quot;Salome&quot; six weeks after giving birth, andthe one who was back on stage one week postpartum.   Dr. Robert T. Sataloff, professor of otolaryngology atJefferson Medical College in Philadelphia, and a singer andteacher of voice himself, advises women to begin singingagain only when they are &quot;pain-free&quot; -- usually about four tosix weeks after delivery -- or when they can do aerobicexercise and 10 situps. In this way they should be inperformance condition about three months after birth.   That's the medical view. But many singers assert thathaving a child is good for the voice. The famousturn-of-the-century contralto Ernestine Schumann-Heinkinsisted that she picked up a note at either end of her rangewith the birth of each of her numerous children. JulianaGondek, whose daughter, Cecilia, now is 19 months old, saysher voice became &quot;clearer, with less distortion around thetone.&quot; Sheri Greenawald, who has a four-year-old, sayssingers &quot;go through a vocal crisis because of the change inthe body. Things get either better or worse.&quot; Her voice, shesays, got bigger, and it took her a year to figure out whatto do with it.   Vocal changes during pregnancy are documented in medicalliterature. According to Dr. Sataloff: &quot;Hormonal changescause fluid retention in the vocal chords that can alter thecharacter of the voice, and make it less efficient, moreeasily fatigued and lose range.&quot;   These changes usually go away after birth, though womenwho breast-feed often find that their high notes remainelusive. Dr. Sataloff says the most common enduring problemwomen have is with their technique. &quot;In the later months ofpregnancy, it becomes more difficult to flex the abdominalmuscles because of the size of the fetus. If women singthrough this period, without support, they often start usingbad technique, which can damage the vocal folds and establishbad habits that persist beyond pregnancy . . .&quot;   Women who do restudy, however, can make the changes workto their advantage: Ms. Gondek says she got used to usingextra support during her pregnancy, and believes theincreased efficiency she acquired improved her voice.   Like all first-time mothers, Ms. Upshaw thought she had itall planned perfectly. She sang concerts until about a monthbefore her due date -- she says she never felt any strain,only exhaustion -- and canceled everything else until thatJan. 23 concert. &quot;I thought, this will be easy,&quot; she says.&quot;My husband will be at home, and if we need sitters, we'llget them.&quot;   The baby was right on time, but life wasn't easy -- it wasoverwhelming. &quot;When I wasn't feeding or changing Sarah, Iwould sit during the day, waiting for her to wake up andthinking, how will I go back to my old life?&quot; Ms. Upshawsays. She started practicing, as planned, four weeks aftergiving birth. Only to her horror, nothing came out. &quot;Icouldn't do it,&quot; she says. &quot;The chords weren't vibrating.There was no sound.&quot;   Ms. Upshaw's voice teacher, Ellen Faull, recommends two orthree months of rest after birth. &quot;Psychologically, you needthe space,&quot; Ms. Faull says. &quot;Four weeks was a littlepremature. But singers want to know that it's still there.&quot;Ms. Upshaw didn't try singing again for another four weeks,getting increasingly nervous and impatient. &quot;I had a lot ofmusic to get into my voice. Finally I had to change theprogram for my recitals with Richard.&quot;   Ms. Upshaw then spent February dashing back and forth toBoston for concerts, with baby and husband in tow. By thetime she started the stressful rehearsals for her firstZerlina in the Metropolitan Opera's new Franco Zeffirelliproduction of &quot;Don Giovanni,&quot; she was exhausted from traveland getting up during the night to nurse.   Having a baby to go home to paradoxically made thingseasier for Ms. Upshaw. &quot;For the first time, I felt that Ihave my family, and I have my work,&quot; she says. &quot;I'd comehome, she'd be smiling -- she doesn't care what I do. It wasvery soothing. I felt that nothing in my work could matter somuch that I needed to get upset about it.   Ms. Upshaw has been told that her voice sounds &quot;older,more mature&quot; since her daughter's birth. She also has foundthat some upper-register singing is easier, which she thinksmay be because after a few months without singing, she hasbeen able to &quot;start over fresh&quot; and eradicate a few badhabits. With only concerts and no opera ahead for the nextfew months, she hopes to be able to relax a bit and watchSarah learn to sit up. Next time, she says, she'll wait threemonths for her first postpartum engagement.                                                                                                          On April 13, Ms. Upshaw sang the Mozart &quot;Requiem&quot; withTrevor Pinnock and the Classical Band at Carnegie Hall. Thewarmth and the floating, rippling, live sound -- thatessential Dawnness -- were back.   ---   Ms. Waleson is a free-lance music writer in New York.</TEXT></DOC>
