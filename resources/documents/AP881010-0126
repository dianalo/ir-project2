SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Acid rain, ozone depletion and the greenhousewarming are related to one another and must be faced together _ notas three separate problems _ an environmental researcher saidMonday.   The three widely discussed climate problems are relatedchemically, and their effects are related economically, IrvingMintzer of the World Resources Institute reported.   Mankind ``must begin to think comprehensively about theseproblems and deal with them,'' he told the opening session of TheGlobal Greenhouse Network First International Conference.   The title of the meeting comes from the ``greenhouse effect,'' awarming of the Earth that scientists say appears to have begun as aresult of increasing carbon dioxide and other chemicals releasedinto the air.   Some researchers have speculated that the greenhouse effect mayhave been a factor in this summer's extraordinarily hot, dryweather, although most say they are unsure as yet.   While conference participants concentrated on the dangers of thegreenhouse warming, Minzter pointed out that chlorofluorocarbons,one of the chemicals blamed for the warming, also damage theEarth's ozone layer when they reach high altitudes. These chemicalsare widely used in refrigeration and other processes. Internationalefforts are underway to reduce their use.   Ozone helps deflect damaging radiation from the sun, anddepletion of this shield could lead to a rise in skin cancer, amongother problems, scientists fear.   Burning of fossil fuels produces, in addition to carbon dioxide,sulfur and nitrogen compounds which can dissolve in the water vaporin the air, causing the rainfall to become more acidic. Thatdamages trees and other plants and can even kill fish inincreasingly acidic lakes.   Getting control of this set of linked problems means dealingwith both complex scientific issues and finding ways to coordinatethe policies of the nations of the world, Mintzer said.   Already the world's temperature has increased slightly, and islikely to continue doing so, he said, and work needs to begin onfinding ways to slow down the rate of climate change.   The average telperature of the Earth is about 0.5 degree Celsius(0.8 degree Fahrenheit) warmer than a century ago, an increasewhich has been attributed to the carbon dioxide released from coaland other fuels being burned.   At current rates that could rise another 1.5 degrees to 4.5degrees by the year 2010, Mintzer said, while sincere efforts tocurtail release of gases could delay that warming until 2075 or so,he said.   While that warming doesn't sound like much, it would be greaterthan any climate change in human history, Mintzer pointed out,meaning there is no precedent for coping with such a shift.   That kind of warming could have serious consequences foragriculture, including a northward shift in croplands, increaseddroughts and changes in which kinds of crops can be grown, saidCynthia Rosenzweig of Columbia University and the NationalAeronautics and Space Administration's Goddard Institute for SpaceStudies.   Some climate change is ``probably inevitable'' she told theconference, and urged both scientific and policy research on copingwith the changes that will come.   The warming will also have serious consequences for beaches,coastal wetlands and cities and towns along the coasts, addedStephen P. Leatherman of the University of Maryland.   Warmer temperatures can be expected to cause melting of some ofthe global ice caps, raising sea levels and inundating many coastalareas, he said.   Worldwide sea levels have risen a half-foot during the lastcentury, Leatherman said, potentially threatening such moderncommunities as Miami Beach, Fla. and Ocean City, Md., as well asrural coastal marshes in Louisiana and Third World countries suchas Bangladesh.</TEXT></DOC>
