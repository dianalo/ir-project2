Following two infiltrations by Arab guerrillas, Prime MinisterMinister Yitzhak Shamir said on Wednesday that guerrillas weretrying to mount a spectacular attack on Israel because the uprisingwas ``petering out.''   Today, however, east Jerusalem streets were deserted in responseto a strike call by uprising leaders. Even fruit and vegetablevendors, normally active during strikes, had closed.   In the Gaza Strip, young Palestinians whose faces were maskedwith checkered Arab scarves stopped cars to ensure workers did notgo to jobs in Israel, according to Arab reports.   Wrecked cars and huge rocks blocked roadways in the West Banktown of Bethlehem and oil was spread on some streets to discouragedrivers. Bethlehem's Manger Square, normally busy with traffic andvendors, was nearly empty.   An Arab reporter noted that even bakeries were shut in Nablus,the West Bank's largest city.   In Baghdad, senior aides of Yasser Arafat on Wednesday said thePalestine Liberation Organization chairman traveled to the Iraqicapital to meet with his commanders ``to discuss ways of escalatingthe Palestinian uprising.''   Only scattered clashes were reported in recent days in theoccupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, where 174 Arabs and two Israelishave been killed since anti-Israeli protests began Dec. 8.   Protesters and Israeli soldiers clashed twice on Wednesdayevening after Moslems ended the sunrise-to-sunset fast that is keptdaily during the holy month of Ramadan, according to reports.   Jewish settlers and Israel radio reported that Arab residents inHebron stood on roofs and shouted ``Slaughter the Jews!'' in adisturbance that lasted late into the night. Soldiers used tear gasto disperse the protesters. No injuries were reported.   The incident began when youths stoned a group of Jewish womenwalking through downtown Hebron at 11 p.m., said Miriam Levinger,who was in the group.   ``We were a group of about 15 women on a stroll when Arabs beganthrowing stones at us,'' Mrs. Levinger said. ``The army cameimmediately and fired tear gas at the Arabs who disappeared into analley.''   Earlier, the army said, Arabs in the Dheishe refugee camp nearBethlehem stoned troops who responded with tear gas and rubberbullets.   A military spokeswoman said seven Palestinians were taken to thehospital, treated and released. Israel Television said somesuffered rubber bullet wounds and others fractures from beatings.   An army report on Wednesday concluded that a 15-year-old femaleJewish settler whose death in the occupied lands raised a furor waskilled by a bullet from a careless Israeli guard, not by stonesthrown by Palestinians.   But the report also blamed Arabs from the West Bank town ofBeita for causing the April 6 confrontation with a group of Israelihikers, during which two Palestinians also died.   Both guerrilla infiltrations this week were near Mount Dov inthe Golan Heights, on Israel's northeastern border. In Tuesday'sclash, three guerrillas and two Israeli soldiers were killed in afierce gun battle.   The two guerrillas killed on Wednesday planned to take hostagesto exchange them for Arab prisoners held in Israel, using U.S.Ambassador Thomas Pickering as a negotiator, said a militarysource, citing documents found on their bodies. The source spoke oncondition of anonymity.   Truck driver Danny Dahan, 24, said the guerrillas fired at himand threw a grenade. ``I jumped from the truck and it started toroll down and I hid behind it. They fired at me while I crawled onthe ground,'' Dahan told Israel radio.   Dahan ran about 1{ miles before reaching an army post, a soldieridentified only as Sgt. Sami told Israel TV.   Hundreds of soldiers combed the rocky terrain, while twohelicopter gunships blanketed the ground with fire to prevent theguerrillas from reaching nearby settlements, said the militarysource. Three hours later, troops spotted the guerrillas in aravine. ``We fired, and they didn't have much choice but to die,''1st Lt. Menny Moses told Israel TV.   The military source said the guerrillas were members of thepro-Syrian Palestine Liberation Front, headed by Mohammed Abbas,who was blamed for the 1985 hijacking of the Achille Lauro cruiseship in which an American was killed. In Lebanon, the pro-SyrianPopular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and the LebaneseCommunist Party both claimed responsibility.</TEXT></DOC>
