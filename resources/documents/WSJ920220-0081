At the time, Mr. Tsongas was one of the most liberalmembers of the U.S. Senate, with a near-perfect record ofsupporting labor. But the Chrysler bailout plan hit a nerve.As fashioned by President Carter and other Democrats, hefelt, it would be a welfare plan for workers without ensuringthe company's survival. &quot;It was the moment he saw through theknee-jerk liberal response,&quot; says economist Robert Barbera,one of the senator's aides at the time.</LP><TEXT>   Instead of backing the Democrats' plan, Sen. Tsongasjoined forces with Republican Sen. Richard Lugar to proposean alternative plan that required tough concessions fromChrysler and its workers -- including a three-year wagefreeze. The incident marked a turning point in Mr. Tsongas'srelations with labor, and the emergence of a unique politicalanimal: a liberal Democrat with a pro-business agenda.   With his victory in New Hampshire Tuesday, Mr. Tsongas hasjoined Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas as a leading contenderfor the Democratic Party's nomination for president. Hisno-nonsense, pro-growth rhetoric has struck a chord,particularly among well-heeled baby boomers. Even somesupply-side Republicans are commending his proposals andapplauding his rhetoric. &quot;You can't have employment anddespise employers,&quot; Mr. Tsongas said in his victory speechTuesday. &quot;No goose, no golden eggs.&quot;   But make no mistake about it: Paul Tsongas is not a ReaganRepublican in disguise. His pro-business sentiments coincidewith a strong belief in activist government that isunforgiving toward businesses that don't perform. He hasblasted Wall Street for encouraging short-term thinking,criticized bloated executive salaries and suggested thatAmerican management too often is the enemy of workers.   &quot;If Tsongas were up there, he sure as hell wouldn't be forlaissez faire,&quot; says J.P. Barger, chief executive of DynatechCorp., head of the conservative Massachusetts High-TechCouncil and an admirer of Mr. Tsongas. &quot;He'd be pushingbusiness to maintain America's leadership.&quot;   The managers of Boston Edison Co. experienced Mr.Tsongas's interventionist style firsthand. As a member of thecompany's board in 1986 and 1987, Mr. Tsongas broke rankswith corporate management after state regulatory officialsrejected a Boston Edison rate-increase request and accusedthe company of lousy management. He arranged to appoint anindependent panel to look into the regulatory agency'scomplaints. And he appeared at a press conference to releasethe panel's report, which castigated Boston Edison for an&quot;excessively adversarial&quot; stance toward regulators and anunduly skeptical view of conservation.   &quot;It was an amazing moment,&quot; recalls Douglas Foy, executivedirector of the Conservation Law Foundation and a member ofthe three-person panel that reviewed Boston Edison'sperformance. &quot;Tsongas grabbed the company by the lapels andsaid, `Folks, this is very serious, and we've got to dealwith it.' They couldn't silence him, and they couldn't affordto ignore him.&quot;   Although he says his desire to be president grew out ofhis personal victory over lymphoma in the early 1980s, PaulTsongas's political ambitions were evident well before that.He was elected to the House of Representatives in 1974, andfour years later successfully challenged GOP Sen. EdwardBrooke, the only black member of the Senate.   Initially, Sen. Tsongas walked in the shadow of hisstate's senior senator, Edward Kennedy. But with the Chryslerbailout, he began to fashion a more independent course. Andin June 1980, as Sen. Kennedy's presidential fortunes werefading in the Democratic primaries, Sen. Tsongas gave acontroversial speech to the Americans for Democratic Actionthat criticized the current state of liberal thought.Liberalism, he declared, was at a crossroads. And hisambition to move beyond the Senate soon became evident. Whenhe was asked by a Boston Globe interviewer in 1981 when hehad last thought about running for president, he responded:&quot;When was the last time I didn't think about it?&quot;   The bout with cancer added a new dimension to Mr.Tsongas's ambition. In speaking to political audiences, the51-year-old candidate shows a penchant for absolutes, andsometimes swerves into the spiritual. &quot;Love of self mustcoexist with love of others,&quot; he said while campaigning inManchester last week. &quot;America must be called to a more noblepurpose. It is not enough to be president. There must be aspirituality to our leadership.&quot;   Mr. Tsongas's appeal in New Hampshire appears to have beenstrongest among affluent and educated voters. Among those whoown a foreign car, he led Gov. Clinton by 41% to 20%. He ledby a similar margin among those with family incomes above$50,000.   As he moves outside New England, he will have to broadenhis appeal. His cool, rational approach can seem to distancehim from the working class and poor voters whose support heneeds. He may also run into problems attracting union voters,and already he has encountered opposition from organizedlabor. Ray Abernathy, spokesman for the Service EmployeesInternational Union, says, &quot;I don't know of anybody in theSEIU who likes him. He's a total business candidate.&quot;   In some ways, the candidate's economic proposals do mirrorthose of President Bush. Mr. Tsongas favors a cut in thecapital-gains tax. He is considering a proposal that wouldeliminate the tax altogether for securities held for morethan seven years. He favors free trade, and he would supporta free-trade agreement with Mexico. He opposes labor-backedlegislation that would prohibit companies from permanentlyreplacing workers who go on strike. And the market-orientedhealth-care plan that he supports has strong philosophicalsimilarities to the plan proposed by President Bush.   Those measures, along with his pro-growth rhetoric, haveearned him praise from many conservative Republicans -- someof whom seem to find Mr. Tsongas more appealing thanPresident Bush. &quot;I've heard a lot of good comments about hisstatements and positions,&quot; says Richard Rahn, formereconomist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. And SenateMajority Leader Robert Dole yesterday offered to give Mr.Tsongas a free trip to Washington to &quot;convince fellowDemocrats to abandon class warfare&quot; and give up their&quot;anti-growth, anti-business, anti-consumer agenda.&quot;   But on other matters, Mr. Tsongas's instincts lead him toproposals that many conservatives abhor. Unlike PresidentBush, for instance, he would exclude real estate from hiscapital-gains tax cut, and he insists that the cut be paidfor by raising the top individual tax rate to 34% or 35%.Additionally, he proposes adding as much as 50 cents a gallonto the current tax on gasoline, phased in over the next 10years, to encourage conservation and pay for public works.   Although he likes nuclear power -- a position that isanathema to many liberal Democrats -- he bases his supportlargely on his concern that too much use of coal and oil ingenerating electricity will lead to global warming. The fearis ridiculed by many conservative Republicans.   Mr. Tsongas's mix of 1960s liberalism and 1990smarket-oriented realism is evident in his proposal toencourage utilities to promote conservation. He would urgeutility regulators to allow higher rates of return for thoseutilities that pursue aggressive conservation plans, butlower rates of return for those that don't. He argues theprofit-squeeze on &quot;bad&quot; utilities would force shareholders torevolt against management and force change -- much as he didwith Boston Edison in 1987.   While he avoids the term &quot;industrial policy,&quot; Mr. Tsongasproposes a set of measures that would amount to just that. Hewould create a new federal office to coordinate &quot;technologyspending and strategy.&quot; He would establish a civilian versionof the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency to come upwith research projects that would strengthen the economy. Hewould create a system for finding and disseminating usefultechnology modeled after the Agricultural Extension Service.And he would use tax dollars to invest &quot;in those technologiesand businesses which are economically critical for America.&quot;   Behind these proposals is a call to both political partiesto abandon ideology. Democrats, he argues, need to learn that&quot;you cannot redistribute wealth that is never created,&quot; whileRepublicans need to drop their &quot;almost religious belief thatan unfettered market is the best of all worlds.&quot;   At the same time, Mr. Tsongas calls on both parties tostop pandering to special interests, and he fiercely opposesa middle-class tax cut. His odd rallying cry -- &quot;No SantaClaus&quot; -- harks back to an article written a decade and ahalf ago by supply-sider Jude Wanniski that called for a &quot;TwoSanta Claus&quot; approach to politics. If the Democrats weregoing to chase votes by spending freely, Mr. Wanniski argued,the Republicans ought to chase votes by cutting taxes freely.   Mr. Tsongas's activist approach runs back to his earlysupport in 1978 of a Consumer Product Safety Commission. Andwhile many Democrats were turning against regulation, Mr.Tsongas was a strong dissenting voice as business interestswere persuading Congress to curb the Federal TradeCommission.   In 1980, he was one of only 10 senators who opposedlegislation empowering the House and Senate to jointly vetoFTC rules governing business practices. Two years later, hedissented again when Congress used the power to override anFTC rule regulating used-car dealers.   Old allies, like consumer activist Ralph Nader, argue thatMr. Tsongas has moved to the right in recent years. But theDemocrat remains faithful to social causes. He is most bitingin describing what he sees as President Bush's failure tostand up for civil rights, and he emphasizes his owncommitment to abortion rights. Early in the 1980s, Mr.Tsongas took the lead in the Senate in supporting legislationto protect homosexuals from discrimination in the workplace,and at a New Hampshire rally gladly accepted a shirt from agay activist.   In foreign policy, Mr. Tsongas was closely identified withthe &quot;nuclear freeze&quot; movement that opposed the ReaganAdministration's arms buildup in the 1980s. Last year, hefavored continuing sanctions against Iraq, rather than goingto war.   But when he was in Congress, his influence was felt mostin the debate over U.S. relations with developing countriesin the Third World. His tour with the Peace Corps in Africahad a lasting impact. More than most in the House and Senate,he pressed for trade sanctions against Rhodesia and SouthAfrica. Yet he also won the hearts of some conservatives bybecoming one of the first in Congress to champion the causeof guerrillas resisting Soviets in Afghanistan.   Through the years, Mr. Tsongas has retained much of theidealism of his youth. Though he often makes references tobeing &quot;another Greek from Massachusetts,&quot; he is far more openin showing his feelings than the ill-fated Michael Dukakis.   He even displays a sense of humor, albeit somewhat dry. Ata recycling center last week in New Hampshire, Mr. Tsongastalked about his plan to encourage recycling by taxing&quot;virgin materials.&quot;   &quot;Not a tax on virgins,&quot; he stressed, in deadpan. &quot;A tax onvirgin materials.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
