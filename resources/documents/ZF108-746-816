A criminal? Crime is a strong word.andP;  Arecomputer users really in the same category as murderers, drug pushers, andsavings andamp; loan executives? The crime may not be as violent as armed robbery,but most computer users do steal.andP;  And most software thieves get away withit-a situation the SPA intends to change.andM;You might be saying, &quot;Wait! I don't steal software.andP;  I've paid for everythingI use.&quot; Congratulations! But buying a legal copy of a program is only part ofthe requirement.andP;  Most of the copyright violations occur when software isused in unauthorized ways.andP;  Ignorance of the law is not a defense, but thefact is, many people don't even know they're doing anything wrong.andP;  Even whenour intentions are honorable, adhering to most copyright licenses isextremely difficult.andP;  Ironically, many software buyers who violate licenseterms see themselves more as victims than criminals.andM;Let's assume someone buys software.andP;  Readers of this column know that payingfor software is not owning it.andP;  All commercial and most custom-writtensoftware is not actually sold; it's licensed.andP;  What's sold is a right to usethe software in a specific way.andP;  The right-to-use might not be what the buyerthinks it is.andP;  The buyer might not agree with the terms of the licenseagreement, especially the many licensing terms that are unclear andunrealistic.andP;  But those are the terms.andP;  The buyer must accept them or not buythe product.andM;Copyright lawandM;The primary statute governing software use is the federal copyright law.andO;Unless explicitly placed in the public domain, all software is owned bysomeone and protected by law.andP;  Owning software means owning its copyright.andO;The copyright owner has control over any and all use of the copyrightedmaterial, including copying.andP;  Title 16 of the U.S.andP;  Code says, &quot;It's illegalto make or distribute copies of copyrighted material without authorization.&quot;andO;Authorization comes in the form of a license from the copyright ownerspelling out exactly what copying, if any, is allowed.andP;  There's only oneexception.andP;  Even if the license forbids copying, the licensee is allowed tomake a backup copy for archival purposes if one is not provided by themanufacturer.andP;  This is not a copy to use on another computer, but a copy tostore in a safe place.andP;  Violation of copyright law is a federal crime.andO;Penalties range from a $50,000 fine to five years in jail.andP;  Copyrightviolation is not a parking ticket !andP;  Whether consultant, developer, VAR oruser, we all have obligations to comply with the law as it applies to eachsoftware product we encounter.andP;  We must advise our clients of theirobligations and encourage them to destroy all unlicensed software.andP;  We needto protect ourselves from those who would involve us in illegal actions.andP;  Asconscience dictates, we should report violators to the SPA.andM;The main difficulty with this is that copyright licenses don't often give youwhat you need and think you paid for (such as the right to have everybody inthe office use the program).andP;  When faced with the prospect of paying againfor a program already possessed, many software buyers prefer to &quot;interpret&quot;the license terms to fit the situation.andP;  Even when a &quot;reasonable&quot;interpretation complies with the spirit of the software license, it stillmight be breaking the law.andM;Is this you?andM;Examples will help illustrate the difference between reason and rights.andP;  Thefollowing stories are true.andP;  Only the names have been changed to protect theguilty.andP;  Besides, we know who they are.andM;You might be planning to put a program on both your office and homecomputers.andP;  Chances are, the license agreement doesn't allow this.andM;You might be planning to put software on a shared network drive so you don'tneed to buy a hard drive for each user's PC.andP;  In many cases, you'recommitting a crime.andM;Your office network has several 386 computers, each with 2M of extended RAM.andO;You buy a new network application that recommends EMS memory.andP;  So you buy aninexpensive utility that converts XMS memory to EMS, and copy it onto eachcomputer's boot disk.andP;  It's just a cheap utility, and you only use it to bootup, but the license undoubtedly requires that a copy be purchased for eachcomputer.andM;Software licensing might not seem logical or fair.andP;  In some cases, you'reprobably right.andP;  What's the practical difference between these two scenarios:You put a spreadsheet program on a single computer, and three people taketurns using the computer.andP;  Or you put it on a 50-node network drive, and thesame three people take turns using the spreadsheet program from theirindividual workstations, one at a time.andP;  The program will be used by the samepeople for the same number of hours each day, so what's the difference? Theanswer depends on the terms of the license agreement.andP;  Probably, the firstmethod is fine, while the second method constitutes three to 50 counts ofcopyright infringement !andP;  Here's another example: You buy a diskdefragmenting utility to use once a month on each office computer.andP;  By thetime you finish, a copy of the utility has been left on each computer foryour future convenience.andP;  Okay? Probably not.andP;  If you run the utility onlyfrom a floppy, you'll be legal, usually (the licenses of some utilityprograms actually forbid use on more than one computer-ever).andP;  But even ifyou only put the utility on the hard drives for your own convenience, you'rethe only person who uses it or knows it exists, and you never use it on twomachines simultaneously, you're probably breaking the law.andM;I selected these examples (out of dozens) to illustrate the difficulty ofobeying most software licenses.andP;  They vary from product to product, and theyaim for compliance with the letter rather than spirit of the law.andP;  Most of usnever buy more than one copy of a defragmenting utility to occasionallymaintain our hard drives, and most software publishers wouldn't expect us to.andO;Since copying can be avoided by running the utility from a floppy disk, thesoftware publisher isn't losing any sales.andP;  But &quot;convenience&quot; copying orplacing it on multiple hard drives, while a common practice, is usuallyillegal.andM;With a &quot;shared&quot; spreadsheet program, the likelihood of abuse increases on anetwork.andP;  What happens when the program is used for more hours or users thana single PC could handle? The network allows simultaneous access, but whatprevents people from using a single copy as if it were multiple illegalcopies? On the other hand, why is it legal to use a product 24 hours a day,seven days a week, while illegal to use it two hours a month on two separatecomputers? Because the license says so.andM;Many software licenses are incomplete.andP;  They don't cover all possiblesituations, forcing you to make an interpretation that may be wrong.andP;  It cantake a strong imagination to foresee and prevent all possible copyrightviolations in a multi-computer business setting.andP;  But once a violationoccurs, you're guilty.andP;  Proving innocence is almost impossible unless you canestablish ambiguous license terms.andP;  The fact that the license is unreasonableand impractical, in your opinion, is not a defense.andM;A rational person says, &quot;Fine, I'll just learn the rules and follow them&quot;-agood plan, until you discover that license terms aren't standardized.andP;  If youuse 10 programs, you might have 10 different sets of rules.andM;Software is typically licensed for use on a single CPU.andP;  This method forbidscopying the program to multiple computers and/or loading the program from anetwork drive into multiple computers.andP;  Some licenses also limit installationto only a single hard drive.andP;  Some single-user programs forbid installationon a network file server, but fail to discuss a local hard drive accessibleby other network stations.andP;  A few licenses, designed to accommodate someonewith both office and home computers, allow multiple installations but forbidsimultaneous use.andP;  (A firm with offices in Australia and the U.S.andP;  thought,incorrectly, that they could buy just one copy and use it in both countries,since the time zone difference would make simultaneous use unlikely).andP;  Someprograms include the technical means to operate on a network, but specifythat additional licenses be purchased for each network user.andP;  Others requirelicenses for each network computer, even if only a fraction of the totalusers need the program.andP;  Some publishers expect you to pay full price foreach additional copy, some provide lower network node or LAN pack pricing,some require only payment of a licensing fee, while a few authorize unlimitedusers on a single network server.andM;Software publishers have the right to limit use of their copyrightedproducts.andP;  A software buyer has no right to use software in an unauthorizedway.andP;  The difficulty arises primarily because licensing is an unusual conceptand software is unlike other products.andP;  What else is bought for hundreds ofdollars, but not actually owned? What else can be so easily duplicated andinstalled in so many different situations and used by so many differentpeople for different purposes?andM;Nothing else is quite like computer software, so none of our experiencesabout property ownership apply.andP;  Publishers often compare software to a book.andO;&quot;You don't buy one book then make copies; so don't do this to software.&quot;andO;Users might respond, &quot;Books are cheap to buy but expensive to duplicate.andO;Software is the opposite.andP;  Why should I pay full price for additional copiesof something I already own? I respect your rights but I won't be rippedoff!.&quot; When people sense unfairness, they are tempted to bend the law.andP;  Howmany of us drive faster than the speed limit when we believe it'ssafe-therefore reasonable-to do so? Perhaps buyers compare software use totelevision broadcasts.andP;  &quot;It may be copyrighted, but I can watch 'Meet Mr.andO;Frog' on every TV in my house simultaneously, and I can tape it for repeatedviewing.&quot; This comparison isn't legally valid, but it's easy to see howconsumers misunderstand software law.andM;Software licensing for local area networks is especially challenging.andP;  If youhave a 50-node network and only five people commonly use a particularprogram, but others have access and might use it, what should you buy? Somesoftware publishers expect you to buy 50 licenses; others expect you to buylicenses for the maximum actual users; still others expect you to buy for thenormal number of users; and some don't care as long as everyone is on thesame file server.andM;Even when a publisher tries to accommodate network users, some networkdesigns don't fit the license.andP;  Many specify a single file server.andP;  Whatabout peer-to-peer networks where users can share hard drives? Is this onenetwork or several, and how many file servers are there? How about a networkthat adds a second file server to improve performance, but doesn't increaseusers?andM;How about remote modem access, or use on a laptop sometimes connected to afile server but otherwise using an internal hard drive? Few software licensesdiscuss such real-world variations, and fewer recognize the very commonpractice of a single user putting software on multiple computers solely forpersonal convenience.andP;  (Microsoft is a notable eception.andP;  Their new licensespecifically discusses office and home use.)andM;Ultimately, the law is the law.andP;  If someone confronts you determined toenforce copyright law, your efforts to comply with the spirit of the law mayfall on deaf ears.andP;  Whatever the license agreement says, that's what you cando.andP;  No less, but no more either, no matter how reasonable, fair-minded, andcarefully implemented your alternative method is.andP;  Most license violationcases get settled, and no challenge on &quot;unfair&quot; license terms has made it tothe Supreme Court.andM;If you're unhappy with software usage terms, don't violate them.andP;  You won'tfind much sympathy in court.andP;  Instead, avoid buying software with licenseagreements you can't abide by.andP;  Write a suggestion letter to the publisher.andO;Some firms do actually want to improve licensing terms.andP;  Unfortunately,others would rather push you into violating an impractical restriction, thentry to catch you doing it.andM;Fighting software piracyandM;I've discussed the difficulty of obeying software license terms to make thepoint that violations are frequent, often intentional, and very rarelydefensible.andP;  Next month I'll describe the steps you can take to ensure thatyou and your clients don't violate copyright laws.andP;  You'll also meet the SPA,a relentless copyright enforcement organization that catches dozens ofcopyright violators of all sizes each month.andM;New surveyandM;Remember, I'm gathering responses to my new survey, &quot;Consultant Practices.&quot;andO;Tell me how you go about being a developer/consultant NAR.andP;  The sensitivestuff will be tabulated and reported anonymously.andP;  I'll only print personalinformation that you authorize.andP;  Respond to the address or BBSs listed below.andM;Coming soon:andM;&quot;Consultant's corner&quot;andM;What do you want to know about consulting, business, programming, hardware,or software?
