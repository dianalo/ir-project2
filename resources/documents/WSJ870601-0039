In heavy New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Harcourt closed Friday at $55.25, down 12.5 cents, giving the purchases an indicated cost of about $265.2 million.    The publishing, insurance and entertainment concern said the shares will be offered to its employee stock ownership plan as part of the recapitalization plan it announced earlier last week to thwart a takeover attempt by British Printing andamp; Communication Corp. Robert Maxwell, the British media magnate who controls British Printing, ended his $44-a-share, or $1.73 billion, offer after Harcourt announced the plan.    Under the recapitalization, Harcourt will take on almost $3 billion in debt and pay holders a special common share dividend of $40 a share in cash, plus a fraction of a share of a newly issued preferred stock.    Harcourt said that the stock buyback, along with certain other moves, will place &quot;more than 40%&quot; of its voting stock in friendly hands.    Even so, some Wall Street observers said Friday that they believe Mr. Maxwell eventually may make a sweetened offer. </TEXT></DOC>
