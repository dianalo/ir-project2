Employees of the Zmaj factory in the Zemun industrial suburbcrowded the steps of the building, carrying national and CommunistParty flags. They demanded meetings with government officials andshouted ``We want changes!''   A severe austerity program imposed by the communist governmentlinks pay to productivity and has forced many companies to reducewages. For workers at the Zmaj plant, it meant a 9 percent cut inApril and another of 4 percent cut in May.   Inflation is running at an annual rate of about 170 percent inYugoslavia and the foreign debt of $21 billion. Living standardshave fallen by about one-third since 1980.   As they marched through the city toward Parliament, the workerschanted ``Down with bureaucracy!'' ``More bread!'' and ``We wantbetter lives!''   A dispatch from the official news agency Tanjug quoted LjubisaKrstic as saying he was paid $115 last month, but should havereceived $50 more.   ``I worked overtime in vain,'' he said. ``They cheated us. Thisis why we came here.''   Police reinforcements were called in to keep passersby andsupporters of the strikers away.   A delegation of protesters was admitted to the building fortalks with officials.   Vice Premier Janez Zemljaric and some members of Parliamentemerged later to address the crowd, but bystanders gathered in apark across the street shouted ``Down with the government!'' and``Thieves! Thieves!''   After four hours, the protesters accepted an offer fromofficials of buses to take them back to Zemun.   About 1,000 onlookers refused to leave immediately and continuedchanting. At least one person was arrested during an attempt tobreak the police line, but the crowd later left peacefully.</TEXT></DOC>
