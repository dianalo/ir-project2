PSCs potential augment factor productivity by affectingmotivational variables that influence worker effort. Based upon the mechanismsby which PSCs might translate into improved performance, a factor augmentationmodel of production is appropriate for measuring the impact of PSCs onproductivity. The major goal of the study is to test for and measurethe effect of PSCs on productivity by applying an econometric productionmodel to a test industry, the chemicals industry, in US manufacturing.Several alternative models, based upon alternative functional forms forproduction, and alternative specifications for the PSC incentive variable,are developed. The models include both a characterization of technology(via the production function) and conditions for firm equilibrium toassure consistent estimates of the production parameters. The empiricalresults indicate that the effect of PSC's on productivity is both positiveand significant. The net effect of PSC's on productivity is estimatedto range between a 9% and a 10% effect upon the value-added of the firm.Estimates of the individual causal channels indicate that PSC's positivelyinfluence productivity principally through the effect upon labor effort.</TEXT></DOC>
