Representatives of the 12-nation European Economic Community leftit to their nations' foreign ministers to formally approve themeasures and set the date for application of the higher tariffs. Theforeign ministers will meet Jan. 23 in Brussels.   ``The hammer is raised, but it won't actually fall until theministers decide, (giving) time for the Americans to show a littleunderstanding,'' said an official of a member nation, who spoke oncondition of anonymity.   Formal approval of the sanctions would escalate a trade disputebetween the United States and the Common Market trading bloc, whichwas touched off Sunday by a European ban on imports of American meattreated with growth hormones.   The United States retaliated against the meat ban by imposing,also on Sunday, higher tariffs on a variety of European products.   Alan Holmer, deputy U.S. trade representative, said in asatellite broadcast from Washington that ``it's presidentialdecision'' whether the United States would take further retaliatorymeasures against any European sanctions.   ``There would be very strong support in the U.S. government fortaking that kind of action if we were to reach that point,'' he toldforeign journalists in a program sponsored by the U.S. government.   ``But frankly we hope we won't have to reach that point and thatthe (EEC) will not take any kind of counter-retaliatory steps in thenext several weeks,'' he said.   The European officials also tentatively decided to allow meatshipped from the United States before Sunday to enter the CommonMarket until the end of the month. Officials said it was hoped thatthe United States would allow a similar grace period for sanctionedproducts from Europe.   Under the tentative plan, the EEC would impose 100 percenttariffs on dried fruit and unshelled walnuts imported from theUnited States. An earlier list had included honey and canned corn.   Total EEC imports of walnuts, mostly to Germany, averaged $58.8million annually over the 1985-87 period, he said. Dried fruitimports, mainly to Germany and Italy, registered an annual averageof $37.8 million during that period. Dried fruit products includeapples, pears, apricots, peaches, prunes and papayas.   The trans-Atlantic conflict was set off by the EEC enforcement ofthe ban on imports of meat from cattle treated with growth hormones.The trading bloc wants to prohibit for health reasons all meat fromsuch animals.   The ban is expected to halt the importation of about $100 millionworth of beef and beef byproducts from the United States, some ofwhich are used in pates and sausages. Meat used to make pet food isexempted.   U.S. officials contend the use of certain hormones to fattencattle, a common practice among American farmers, does not pose ahealth risk.   ``The (community) has failed to present any evidence that aproper application of the growth-producing hormones in question poseany threat to human or to animal health,'' Holmer said.   ``We as yet have seen no scientific evidence whatsoever tosupport the (EEC) hormone ban and as a result we feel it necessaryto protect U.S. trade interests,'' he said.   The meat ban was to have taken effect Jan. 1, 1988, but thetrading bloc agreed to delay it for a year. It has since refusedAmerican appeals for yet another postponement.   The meat imports represent a small portion of the estimated $166billion in trade between the United States and the Common Market.   In retaliation for the meat ban, the United States on Sundayimposed 100 percent duties on boneless beef, pork hams andshoulders, prepared or preserved tomatoes, instant coffee, fermentedalcoholic beverages containing less than 7 percent alcohol byvolume, certain fruit juices, and certain packaged pet food madefrom grains. The sanctions are worth about $100 million.   The Common Market has filed a complaint with the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade to protest the U.S. sanctions. The96-nation GATT is both an agreement and a forum for ensuring thefree movement off goods around the world. The complaint was filed inNovember before the sanctions went into effect.   Holmer reiterated that the United States would like the CommonMarket to turn the dispute over to a special GATT panel forresolution but that it has so far refused to do so.   The Canadian government also has not gone along with the meatban. Australia, New Zealand, Brazil and Argentina have agreed toship meat from untreated cattle to Europe.   EEC members are France, West Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Belgium,the Netherlands, Denmark, Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and theUnited Kingdom.</TEXT></DOC>
