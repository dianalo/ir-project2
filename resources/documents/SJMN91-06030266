A seven-yearveteran restaurateur, Abrahams owns La Pastaia in Palo Alto. She sold IlPastaio in Los Gatos in September.;    On our lunch visit, we were greeted bya friendly hostess and a near capacity crowd of diners. We were seatedimmediately and given the all-Italian menus. Abrahams said the menu isstrictly Italian to distinguish La Pastaia from other restaurants that might&quot;Americanize&quot; their food. &quot;We offer old country Italian food,&quot; she said.However, she said her staff will accommodate requests to meet special healthneeds of customers.;    Each day, the staff produces fresh pasta, pizza, breadand desserts. The ravioli and pizza pies are hand-rolled and hand cut.;    LaPastaia, which translates to The Pasta Maker, offers a 15-choice selection oflinguine, ravioli, fettucine and cappellini, which range from $7.95 to $11.50.Linguine arrabiata, which features tomato, onion, hot peppers and pancetta, isa popular choice, Abrahams said.;    Pizzas are cooked in a wood-burning oven.The end product is a single serving pizza with a crisp bottom and soft middlebecause the heat is radiated from the bottom.;    The 10 or so pizzacombinations range from $5.95 to $8.75. Abrahams said a favorite is salsiccia,a combination of sausage, mushrooms, tomatoes, roasted garlic, Romano andmozzarella cheeses. For vegetarians, there's verdure ai ferri, a mixture ofroasted eggplant, red bell papper, zucchini, artichoke, onion and fontina.;   La Pastaia also offers sandwich and salad combination plates that vary from$5.95 to $8.50. Choices include chicken, ground sirloin and grilled eggplant.Favorites include the petti di pollo, grilled chicken breast with tomato andpesto aioli, Abrahams said.;    For heartier appetites, entrees includechicken, seafood and steak, which range from $10.95 to $15.95. Another popularitem, Abrahams said, is stufato d'agnello, a braised lamb stew withartichokes, white wine and polenta.;    Keeping with its Italian theme, LaPastaia's wine list consists of Italian wine only. There's also a cappuccinobar.;    We started our meal with appetizers. My companion chose the calamarifritti ($6.95). The calamari is deep fried and prepared with a lightsprinkling of flour. It's served with aioli, mayonnaise sprinkled with garlicand hot pepper flakes. I had the zuppa di verdure or vegetable soup ($4.95).Chopped vegetables were encased in a mild broth. We both found the appetizerspleasing.;    We then split pizza and pasta. For our pizza choice, we chosepancetta ($7.95). The pizza was generously sprinkled with chopped Italianbacon, onion, garlic, tomato and mozzarella.;    My companion found theroasted garlic outsanding, saying it brought out the flavor of all thetoppings.;    We both were served raviola al sugo, cheese ravioli withstrained meat sauce ($9.50). Cheese oozed from the ravioli when pierced withour forks. The ravioli was tender and delicious.;    Although we were full, wecouldn't resist dolci, or desserts, which range from $4.50 to $6.50. We splittiramisu, a scrumptious mixture of ladyfingers, espresso, marsala andmascarpone custard ($5.50).;    The dessert menu is full of temptations. Abite is all that's required to satisfy a sweet tooth, so a small group cansplit one order. Torta micidaile or killer chocolate cake needs no furtherexplanation. There are also two assorted fruit plates.;    We found our mealwas excellent, the prices were reasonable and the service was courteous.
