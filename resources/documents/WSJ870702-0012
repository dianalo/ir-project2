Perry and David ShribmanStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 07/02/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> CONGRESS (CNG) </IN><TEXT>   With 12 months to go until their party's nominating convention, seven early-bird Democratic presidential candidates jockeyed for position in the 1988 campaign's first big televised debate.    Each of the Democrats attempted to score points and impress an audience tuned in to a special two-hour showing of William F. Buckley's &quot;Firing Line&quot; on the public broadcasting network. But it wasn't at all certain how many people devoted two hours of a summer's evening to watch the seven earnest hopefuls search for ways to grab the public's attention, if not its imagination.    Bruce Babbitt, former governor of Arizona, chose to break out of the pack -- only the Rev. Jesse Jackson is widely known by the American public -- by listing possible members of his cabinet.    Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois said that if he gets to the White House, he would hang portraits there of working people -- a steelworker, a coal miner, a working mother, a school teacher -- instead of great American presidents.    But in their first big-league outing, some of the candidates were making more errors than hits.    Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr., when asked what portraits he would nail to the White House walls, mentioned &quot;President James K. Knox.&quot; He apparently meant to say President James K. Polk. Mr. Jackson had problems with history, too. He blamed the infamous &quot;Palmer raids&quot; in 1919 against suspected radicals on President Herbert Hoover. Actually, they took place under President Woodrow Wilson.    One of the sharpest clashes came over trade policy.    Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri defended his legislation that holds out the threat of retaliation against countries with unfair trade practices. &quot;As long as you don't put action behind your words, you're not going to get results,&quot; he said.    He was challenged by Mr. Babbitt, who described the Gephardt proposal as &quot;Smoot-Hawley all over again.&quot; The Smoot-Hawley tariff was imposed just before the Great Depression and led to retaliatory actions against U.S. goods.    Each of the candidates attempted to make a distinctive mark. The 39-year-old Sen. Gore, for example, stressed his youth. Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts stressed his success in rebuilding his state's economy. And Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware emphasized his liberal credentials by attacking investment bankers and referring to President Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative as the &quot;Star Wars fantasy.&quot;    The Democrats expressed some second thoughts about the tax-overhaul law enacted last year. Sen. Gore said the legislation gave &quot;way too much relief&quot; to upper-income taxpayers, and Gov. Dukakis expressed disappointment that it didn't shrink the federal budget deficit. Sen. Simon said he was proud he opposed the legislation.    The candidates unanimously opposed U.S. policy in Central America, with Gov. Dukakis charging that the Reagan administration's efforts to undermine Nicaragua were &quot;doomed to failure.&quot; Mr. Jackson, meanwhile, called on the U.S. to change its relationship with Cuba and for Cuban leader Fidel Castro to &quot;change his ways&quot; on human-rights issues.    The show, broadcast live from a theater in Houston, included short, taped biographies of the candidates at the start and more tapes at the end -- of the candidates telling stories on the stump. These promotional films unabashedly emphasized each of the candidates' versions of picture-book family lives.    More debates -- some one-on-one, some all-Democratic, some-all-Republican -- will follow the Houston debate. An early sour note was expressed by Rep. Patricia Schroeder of Colorado, who is thinking about running and complained about not being included in this debate.    &quot;For 200 years the presidential debates in America have been stag,&quot; she said. &quot;Unfortunately tonight they're going to be stag again.&quot;    For the record, Mr. Babbitt, in the evening's most unusual thrust, said members of his cabinet would include Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia, former deputy CIA director Bobby Inman, House Budget Committee Chairman William Gray of Pennsylvania, diplomat Warren Christopher, children's rights advocate Marian Wright Edelman, and Robert Strauss, former chairman of the Democratic National Committee and Mr. Buckley's fellow debate moderator. </TEXT></DOC>
