The study said that stringent government controls on emissionsof carbon dioxide and other gases contributing to warming of theEarth, combined with policies discouraging travel by car, couldlessen the impact of alternate fuels on the climate.   The study by independent consultant Michael Walsh was presentedat the annual meeting of the Society of Automotive Engineers.   Alternate fuels such as methanol are derived from coal, naturalgas and plants and are used instead of gasoline to fuel cars.Vehicles able to burn such fuels have been built as prototypes bymajor U.S. automakers.   However, some alternatives to gasoline create high levels ofcarbon dioxide when burned. That gas, along with others, caninhibit the movement of the sun's heat from the atmosphere backinto space.   Some scientists have predicted that if present trends continue,the Earth's atmosphere will have warmed on average by severaldegrees by the middle of the next century, with possibledevastating effects on agriculture and the environment.   Alternate fuels ``could increase carbon dioxide emissionssubstantially,'' the study said. ``The reason is that coal could beused as a feedstock to manufacture methanol, and if it were to doso, overall carbon dioxide emissions would approximately double permile driven, assuming that vehicles achieved the same energyefficiency as with conventional fuels.''   Moreover, the adoption of methanol commercially would encouragecontinued use of fossil fuels and discourage research intoelectrical power plants and other alternatives, the study said.   The study said the increased carbon dioxide output could becountered by adopting standards to lower emissions by the world'svehicles by 20 percent in the short term and 50 percent over alonger term.   Also, the study said energy prices should be gradually increasedsignificantly to hold down growth in the number of vehicles and to``encourage individuals to purchase highly efficient vehicles andfuels and to make (a) lifestyle decision which will tend tominimize vehicle travel as well as other energy uses.''</TEXT></DOC>
