The methyl group is transferred to Coenzyme M and the carbonylto the nickel site in the complex. Methylcoenzyme M is reductively demethylatedto methane with electrons derived from the oxidation of the bound carbonyl.A ferredoxin is the immediate electron acceptor of electrons leavingthe complex. Membrane components are implicated in electron transportfrom the ferredoxin to methylcoenzyme m. A corrinoid protein in the complexis thought to catalyze methyl transfer, electron transfer, or both. Allof the above proteins have been purified except the corrinoid protein.Our laboratory is investigating the catalytic mechanism of the purifiedproteins. Biochemical characterizations of all proteins will includeamino acid analysis and N-terminal sequencing, kinetic parameters, physicaland other properties. 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
