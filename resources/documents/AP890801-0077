Mickey Leland, D-Texas, said Tuesday at a newsconference where he joined two other lawmakers in releasing thereport.   It lists five major problems in developing nations _ economicstagnation, environmental damage, the threat to democracy from themilitary's political power, weapons proliferation and drugtrafficking.   In one major recommendation, the report by Congress' ArmsControl and Foreign Policy Caucus calls for all nations to cuttheir military budgets by 50 percent, providing money for urgentcivilian needs.   The report also suggests that the United States press fornegotiated settlements to civil wars and urges a U.S. ban onmilitary aid to countries with dictatorships or to those ruled bymilitary forces that act independently of elected governments.   The United States cannot concentrate alone on the ``outdatedEast-West, Cold War mentality,'' according to the study.   ``Today's security threats are problems like global warming andinternational debt,'' said Rep. Matthew F. McHugh, D-N.Y., anothercongressman involved with the report.   ``They aren't American or Soviet problems alone, and they can'tbe solved bilaterally _ they are transnational problems thatrequire transnational solutions.''   Leland noted that wars have an economic as well as personalcost, saying that last year ``the 23 wars in the developing worldnot only killed hundreds of thousands of people and createdmillions of refugees, they also reduced U.S. exports by billion ofdollars.''   The report also recommended the appointment of a Cabinet-levelU.S. development representative _ similar to the U.S. traderepresentative _ to concentrate on the problems of developingnations. And it called for a summit between developed anddeveloping countries.   Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., a member of the caucus, said the``five global epidemics may not explode as fast as nuclear weapons,but their net effect could be just the same: Destruction of oursociety as we know it.''   The report said the five major Third World problems it focusedon ``are emerging as a potentially greater long-term threat to U.S.security than Soviet military power.''   McHugh, Hatfield and Leland commissioned the report, ``TheDeveloping World: Danger Point for U.S. Security.''   A review of recent polls, according to the report, showed thatAmericans are more concerned with developing nations and problemssuch as drugs and trade than fears about East-West conflicts.</TEXT></DOC>
