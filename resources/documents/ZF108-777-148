(program)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Hard CopyandM;Printer sharing, while not scintillating stuff, is why we're all here.andP;  Thefirst LANs were developed to let multiple users share expensive hardwareperipherals, and the printer is undoubtedly the most popular peripheral inany office.andP;  However, as the later functions of LANs, like file sharing anddistributed processing, became more advanced, their printer-sharingcapabilities languished.andP;  Sophisticated network operating systems--capable ofconnecting various types of clients, hooking to minicomputer environments,and providing fault-tolerant operation--still provide the bare minimum ofprint-sharing functions.andM;NetWare, the most popular of all network operating systems, is infamous forits Sisyphean printing scheme.andP;  Inconvenience is piled upon aggravation asusers are constantly faced not only with cryptic, time-consuming printingcommands like CAPTURE and NPRINT but with tedious queue management commandsas well.andM;Furthermore, printers on NetWare can only be attached to the file server,with a maximum of five printers per server, an inadequate number for manycompanies' needs.andM;To print under NetWare 286 without a third-party utility, users have to exittheir applications and type a CAPTURE command at the DOS prompt, whichredirects the applications output to a network printer.andP;  They then have tore-enter the application, print, and then exit and type ENDCAPTURE.andO;Alternately, NetWare will time out and release the print job to the networkprinter, without an ENDCAPTURE command.andP;  All queue management and printersetup has to be done at the command line.andM;NetWare 386 claims to have improved printing, but the only enhancement islocal printer support.andP;  The unfriendly command line interface remains, withno pop-up support from within an application.andP;  The third-party utilities thatmade their name easing the printing nightmare under NetWare have not beenrendered obsolete.andM;Users still need third-party utilities, mainly because of theirterminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) capabilities.andP;  With a print utility, userscan share all the printers across a network, specifying their printer choice,configuration, and forms.andP;  Once a job has been submitted to a shared printer,the user can view and manage the various print queues, deleting andreordering jobs as well as checking on their status.andM;The UtilitariansandM;Printer utilities are, for the most part, created equal.andP;  Some are more fullyfeatured than others, and the user can pay between $200 and $400 more forthat added functionality.andP;  They can all be loaded as TSR programs, and manyprinters also let users run them under DOS.andM;The main worry with TSR programs is the amount of RAM they consume.andP;  Theleast greedy of all packages is Printer Assist from Fresh Technology(Gilbert, Ariz.), which requires 3KB of memory on the print server.andP;  Next isLANSpool from LAN Systems (New York) which requires slightly more than 6KB onthe print server, followed closely by Brightwork's (Tintin Falls, N.J.)andO;PS-Print, which needs 8KB.andP;  Some programs require memory on both the user andthe print server workstation.andM;Most of these utilities also include an optional queue management module,which lets users check on their print jobs once they've been submitted.andP;  Thepackages generally make the distinction between a run-of-the-mill user and anadministrator, so only authorized users can actually reorder the jobs in thequeue or delete jobs that are not their own.andM;With all the printers made available across a network through theseutilities, users need a way to configure printers for their specific printjobs.andP;  The more comprehensive packages let users send a setup string to theprinter, which specifies fonts and the type of paper used.andP;  Some also allowfor customizable banner pages.andM;One of the main considerations when running a utility under NetWare 286 iswhether or not it's a value-added process (VAP), or, if it is running underNetWare 386, whether it's a NetWare Loadable Module (NLM).andP;  There areadvantages and disadvantages to running these server-based modules.andP;  Thecentral advantage to a utility running as a VAP or NLM is that all theprocessing is done on the file server, as opposed to a workstation, therebyreducing memory overhead on each workstation.andP;  Also, users can print to aprinter attached to a local workstation, even if that machine is not loggedin.andP;  On the down side, VAPs and NLMs, because they are third-party products,may present compatibility problems.andP;  And if a problem does arise, it affectsthe file server, as opposed to a singleandM;Certainly NetWare is not the only operating system that requires printerutilities.andP;  3Com's 3+ and 3+Open do not have any kind of printer utility.andO;The only printing solution available from 3Com is a very expensive dedicatedprinter they use from within an applications.andP;  Up to five printers can beattached to any PC, but an unlimited number of printers can be shared acrossa network.andM;PS-Print is also tightly integrated with NetWare.andP;  Although it converts allNetWare commands and messages into user-friendly menus, expert users arealways free to use the actual NetWare commands to access shared printers.andO;Users can also manage the print queues by deleting and reordering jobs.andO;PS-Print informs users of individual job status and any printer problems,such as paper jams or a printer going offline, and it also has forms handlingcapability.andP;  Multiple forms can be printed to one printer and PS-Printinforms users when forms need changing.andM;Queue-It! lets network managers create an unlimited number of job names andmaintains a database of them for all users to share.andP;  PS-Print takes up only8KB of memory while Queue-It! requires between 12KB and 25KB.andP;  The package ispriced at $395 per file server.andM;PS-Print will also be sold by Pacific Data Products (PDP) of San Diego,Calif., under the private label PacificPrint.andP;  The software is for use withtwo of PDP's emulation cartridges for HP LaserJet printers, PacificPage forPostScript emulation, and Plotter In A Cartridge, which provides HP-GL outputon a laser printer.andP;  When used with these cartridges, PacificPrint turnsnetworked laser printers into PostScript printers or plotters.andM;Sharing plotters over a network is especially difficult because of thetwo-way communications and constant forms adjustment inherent in plotting.andO;In general, it's a good idea to have someone monitoring the plotter, whereasprinters can, of course, run unattended.andP;  However, any plotter that can beshared on a NetWare file server can be shared with PacificPrint, completewith pop-up and queue management support.andM;A comparable product to PS-Print is LAN Systems' LANSpool.andP;  The newestversion of LANSpool comes bundled with a print selector, LAN-Print, whichallows users to change printers between jobs from within an application.andO;LANSpool requires 2.5KB of memory on the print server and no memory at theusers' workstations.andP;  Up to five printers can be attached to one printserver.andM;LANPrint also enhances the management capabilities of LANSpool, much likeQueue-It! does for PS-Print.andP;  LANPrint supports an unlimited number ofNetWare print modes and automatically reads and updates Novell's Printcondatabase listing of all network printers and their configurations.andP;  With amenu-driven interface, users can alter print queues, specify type styles andnumber of print copies, notify users when a job is completed, and customizethe banner on the title page.andM;LANSpool was the first printer-sharing package to run as a VAP under NetWare.andO;The main advantage of running as a VAP is that users can access a sharedprinter even when the PC the printer is attached to is not logged onto thenetwork and a server connection is not wasted.andP;  LANSpool supports up to 40printers per VAP, with unlimited VAPs per server.andM;LANSpool 2.0 also supports Novell forms and integrates existing Novellutilities like PCONSOLE and PRINTDEF.andP;  When form changes are necessary,LANSpool notifies the user through pop-up messages.andP;  The LANSpool interface,consistent with other NetWare utilities, reduces training time for users.andP;  Asingle-server, unlimited user license fee costs just under $400.andP;  Upgradesare available at $95 a copy.andP;  Printer Assist from Fresh Technology (Gilbert,Ariz.) is one of the company's NetWare utilities.andP;  Printer Assist lets usersprint to any printer on the network and fully integrates with all NetWareprinting functions.andP;  Fresh Technology just released version 4.0 of PrinterAssist.andP;  The upgraded package now services both NetWare 286 and 386 printqueues concurrently, and it no longer requires that a user be logged in forthe workstation printer to be accessed.andM;Version 4.0 also provides complete forms support to designated groups orindividual users to perform form changes.andP;  Users are informed of the statusof their print jobs, as well as printer offline and out-of-paper conditions.andO;Printer Assist also works across bridged servers and logs local printeractivity.andP;  Each shared printer can service up to 26 print queues on 26different file servers, avoiding the eight-server restriction imposed byNetWare.andM;The new Printer Assist also services jobs more quickly and efficiently.andO;Activity on the print server can be recorded completely with information onthe name of the user printing, job date and time, number of bytes per job,and so on.andP;  For providing similar functionality to LANSpool and PS-Print,Printer Assist is available at a fraction of the cost, priced at $179 perserver.andP;  It does not run as a VAP or NLM but does provide complete PRINTCONand PRINTDEF support.andM;Inexpensive AlternativesandM;Along with the raft of utilities in its LAN Administration package, SaberSoftware (Dallas) also provides Saber Print Manager.andP;  Although not as fullyfeatured as PS-Print or LANSpool, Print Manager is a cheaper alternative at$195 per server for companies that are not printer-intensive.andM;Print Manager lets users set up Novell print options through a menu-driveninterface, which eliminates the need for users to know all the necessaryparameters by heart.andP;  And like all printer utilities, Saber Print Managerlets users configure their printers within an application.andP;  The utility alsoincludes full queue support, letting users view and manager their printqueues, as well as providing a menu-driven front end to NetWare's Byzantinecommand line printing commands.andM;Another inexpensive alternative to full-blown printer-sharing packages is theNetwork Assistant Plus from 3rd Planet Software (Los Angeles), which recentlyacquired the vendors of the product, Cybertek LAN Software.andP;  The product letsusers access any network printer from any workstation on the network and letsthem determine when and in what quantity the job will be printed.andM;Network Assistant Plus' major selling point is probably its idiot-proofinterface.andP;  When they want to print within an application, users have only tohit a hot key.andP;  They are then provided with a list of printer names, whichhave presumably been given easily identifiable names at installation, andthey can select the desired printer.andP;  This point-and-print functionalityrequires 29KB of memory and costs $295 per file server.andM;Printing on 3ComandM;Certainly NetWare is not the only operating system that requires printerutilities.andP;  3Com's 3+ and 3+ Open do not have any kind of printer utility.andO;The only printing solution available from 3Com is a very expensive dedicatedprint server.andM;The same holds true for IBM's PC LAN Program.andP;  Ultinet Development, a SanDiego developer of LAN utilities for LAN Manager and MS-Net networks,provides Print+ for 3+ and 3+Open LANs.andP;  Print + allows network users toaccess any printer on the network on a peer-to-peer basis instead of routingrequests through the file server.andP;  Version 2.0 of Print+ requires no memoryoverhead on either users' workstations or the file server.andP;  The softwarerequires 13KB of RAM on the machine acting as the print server.andP;  Includedwith every copy of Print+ is Queue+, which allows users to view print jobs inthe queue and select the printer port for each job.andP;  Queue+ requires 6.5KB oneach workstation.andP;  Print+ is priced at $895 for a basic, three-print serverlicense.andM;The Best SolutionandM;As convenient as it might be, there are some problems associated withconnecting printers to workstations other than the file server.andP;  Since themachine is not a dedicated print server, there's the danger of its userloading too many TSR programs into memory or rebooting the machine withoutstopping to think.andM;Furthermore, many users resent the responsibility and social hazard involvedin having a shared printer attached to their machines.andP;  Inevitably, they arecalled on to maintain the printer--loading the correct paper and changing thetoner.andP;  They are also plagued by chatty colleagues dropping by to pick uptheir print jobs and phone calls demanding to know whether the job isactually printing.andP;  Being the person who baby-sits the print server is athankless second job.andM;There is a solution for those users who would rather not attach a printer toa workstation.andP;  Microtest's (Phoenix) Lanport acts like a dedicated printserver but doesn't need to be attached to a PC.andP;  Instead, the Lanportconnects directly to the LAN hardware to provide users with transparent,trouble-free access to shared printers.andP;  Additionally, for larger companies,the Lanport allows several printers to be located in a separate room, makingmaintenance and security easier.andM;The Lanport supports NetWare 286 and 386 and now comes bundled with its ownprint server software.andP;  For now, Lanport also only provides Ethernet support,although Arcnet and Token Ring capability is promised.andP;  It is priced between$495 and $695.andP;  (For a Test Drive of the Lanport, see the May 1990 issue, p.andO;160).andM;Printer Sharing AlternativesandM;There are alternatives to software utilities, and indeed to LANs, when itcomes to printer sharing.andP;  Users who want to share peripherals cheaply andwho have minimal file transfer needs could investigage the hardwarealternatives to print utilities.andP;  All of these alternatives revolve aroundthe use of some sort of data switch, and provide varying degrees of expansionand intelligence.andM;The first and most obvious alternative is a simple manual data switch, or A/Bbox.andP;  Everyone has seen one of these boxes, which allow users to share eitherone peripheral among several PCs or several peripherals on one PC.andP;  Althoughlimited in the number of PCs and peripherals they support, A/B boxes aretransparent to software and are manually controlled.andP;  Users know exactly whohas access to the printer or plotter at all times.andM;This manual capability is more a burden than a blessing, however.andP;  Usersdon't want to be bothered with having to set up the connection between the PCand the peripheral themselves.andP;  Enter printer sharing devices, which areattached to the PC's serial port.andP;  Printer sharing devices are also switches,but they set up the connection automatically between PC and printer as soonas the user sends a file.andP;  If someone else is using the peripheral, someprinter sharing devices notify the user with a busy signal.andP;  These areunbuffered automatic or scanning devices.andM;Buffered automatic switches have memory built into the switch that storeseach incoming print job until the printer or plotter is free to service it.andO;The obvious advantage is that users can send their jobs to the printer andforget about them, instead of having to wait until the printer is free.andP;  Thebuffered automatic switches have an equal number of ports for input andoutput devices.andP;  There are also intelligent automatic switches available thatallow configuration of all the ports for either input or output devices.andO;Intelligent switches allow for an increased measure of flexibility and alsoprovide some basic background file transfer functions.andM;A step up from intelligent switches are RS-232 LANs, although the distinctionis blurring since they both provide file transfer capability.andP;  Thesezero-slot LANs only require cabling that plugs into your PC's serial port,and some software.andP;  Generally, the cables run from the PCs to the hub of thenetwork, which is itself essentially a large data switch.andP;  The software letsusers print jobs on a first-come, first-served basis.andP;  The main advantage ofan RS-232 LAN over a simple data switch is that it allows several PCs toaccess several peripherals.andP;  Also, mainframes can access printers attached toa PC network through a 3270 to RS-232 converter.andM;A larger version of an RS-232 LAN is a data PBX.andP;  Like a zero-slot LAN, thedata PBX uses a switch to connect intelligent devices to computers.andO;Initially, data PBXs were used to provide terminal connections to mainframesand minis, whereas RS-232 LANs were intended for intelligent machines.andP;  Now,the only delimiting factor between the two seems to be size.andP;  RS-232 LANs aregenerally found in workgroups under 50, with data PBXs serving largerinstallations.andM;Prices vary from vendor to vendor.andP;  Printer sharing devices usually costaround $100 per connection, and RS-232 LANs and data PBXs run between $100and $300.andP;  They might not be worth it.andP;  None of these alternatives isappreciably cheaper than an entry-level LAN, which can run between $300 and$600 per node, and they are all severely limited in their file transfer andexpansion capability.andP;  Nor are they necessarily easier to install since DIPswitches have to be set the ports configured.andP;  Furthermore, they're slow.andP;  Atleast, with a cheap Arcnet network, a user is guaranteed expansion capabilityand practical applications sharing.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
