(BSB) refused troubled Australianbusinessman Alan Bond any further extensions to sell hisstake in the television company, the shareholders saidyesterday.   Granada Group PLC, Pearson PLC, Reed International PLC andChargeurs S.A., of France, said the latest extension ran outJuly 19 for Mr. Bond's company, Bond Corp. Holdings Ltd.</LP><TEXT>   The effect of the expiration is to lower Mr. Bond's stakein the second satellite television network for the U.K. to7.4% from an original 37%, said BSB.   The major shareholders had given Bond a number ofextensions on time limits in which to sell his stake withoutit being diluted after a #450 million ($821.9 million) rightsissue in January. If the deadline had been met, the buyercould have taken up a position in rights issues that wouldhave maintained the higher stake in BSB.   Now analysts suggest Mr. Bond's stake is worth about #30million at market value, against his total originalinvestment of #155 million.   A number of potential buyers of the Bond stake had beenmentioned by analysts. Robert Maxwell, chairman and chiefexecutive of the media conglomerate Maxwell CommunicationCorp., was considered the favorite, despite a potentialconflict in cross-media ownership.   Mr. Maxwell wasn't immediately available for comment.</TEXT></DOC>
