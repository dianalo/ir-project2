On July 13, 1988 the Board issued a temporary regulationthat placed certain restrictions on actions that insured institutions thatdo not currently meet their minimum regulatory capital requirements maytake regarding such stock. Upon further review, the Board has determinedthat certain revisions in the scope of that temporary regulation are bothappropriate and necessary to the effective supervision of insured institutionsnot meeting their fully phased-in capital requirements. By separate action,the Board is today withdrawing the previously published temporary regulation.Today's regulation replaces the one previously published. Today's temporary regulation provides that no insured institution failingto meet its minimum regulatory capital requirement may buy or sell FreddieMac preferred stock without obtaining prior approval from its PrincipalSupervisory Agent (``PSA'') or his designee, subject to the concurrenceof the Office of Regulatory Activities. It also sets forth general factorsto be contained in an institution's written application for approval thatthe PSA will consider in determining whether to grant such approval. Additionally,the temporary regulation restricts those insured institutions not meetingtheir fully phased-in capital requirements from taking certain actionsas a result of any purchase or sale of Freddie Mac stock that might adverselyaffect their ability to meet their fully phased-in capital requirements,absent prior approval from their PSA.

Before this time, pursuant to a previous resolution creating theclass of preferred stock covered by the July 13 action, such stock couldonly be held by stockholders of a Federal Home Loan Bank, a Federal HomeLoan Bank in connection with collateral for advances, the FSLIC in connectionwith the receivership or insolvency of a holder of the preferred stock,a pre-approved market maker or nominee thereof, or a specialist on anynational securities exchange. Additionally, single holders of such preferredstock were limited in the maximum amount of shares each could hold to 150,000,subject to certain grandfathering provisions. Freddie Mac's Board of Directorsalso acted on July 13, 1988 to increase sequentially the maximum numberof shares that any single holder could own from 150,000 to 600,000 by January1, 1989.Currently, Freddie Mac preferred stock is primarily held by the approximately3,000 insured institutions that own stock in the Federal Home Loan Banks.In general, the Board believes that any decision to purchase or sell FreddieMac stock both before and after January 1, 1989, is best left to the soundbusiness judgment of insured institutions themselves. The Board is concerned,however, with the possible effect of the removal of the restrictions onownership and transferability of Freddie Mac preferred stock on those insuredinstitutions not currently meeting their minimum regulatory capital requirementas set forth in 12 CFR 563.13 and 12 CFR 563.14. These institutions requirecloser supervision as a result of their impaired capital position. As aresult, on July 13, 1988 the Board adopted a temporary rule with a requestfor comments placing certain restrictions on actions such institutionscould take regarding this preferred stock without obtaining prior approvalfrom their PSAs. <T3>See</T3> Board Res. No. 88-577, 53 FR 27153 (July 19, 1988).Upon further review, however, the Board believes that that temporary regulationdid not adequately address an equally important concern requiring promptattention by the Board. It is the Board's view that any gains from suchsale of Freddie Mac stock should generally be applied to improve the capitalposition of insured institutions not yet meeting their fully phased-incapital requirement as set forth in 12 CFR 563.13 and 12 CFR 563.14. Asthe Board has indicated in the past, it is important that insured institutionsraise their capital levels as rapidly as possible in order to provide adequateprotection to insured institutions, their depositors, and the FSLIC fund.<T3>See </T3>Board Res. No. 87-661, 52 FR 23845 (June 25, 1987); BoardRes. No. 86-857, 51 FR 33571-73 (Sept. 22, 1986); Board Res. No. 86-426,51 FR 16550, 16552 (May 5, 1986). <T3>See also </T3>Board Res. No. 87-1298, 53 FR 369 (Jan. 6, 1988). Ithas therefore determined to withdraw that temporary regulation by a resolutionpublished elsewhere in the final rules section of the <T4>Federal Register</T4> and to substitute this regulation in its place.The temporary regulation adopted today and effective upon publication inthe <T4>Federal Register</T4> requires that an insured institution not satisfyingits minimum capital requirement obtain the approval of its PSA or his designee,subject to the concurrence of the Office of Regulatory Activities, beforebuying or selling any of the shares of Freddie Mac preferred stock it nowholds or may later acquire. This restriction is similar to restrictionsthe Board has imposed on such institutions in other contexts. <T3>See, e.g., </T3>12 CFR 563.4 (brokered deposits), 12 CFR 563.9-8 (c)(2)(iii)(equity risk investments). In so acting, the Board believed, as it doestoday, that the impaired capital status of such insured institutions warrantsparticular supervisory scrutiny of certain business decisions. The PSAfor the institution is best able to determine whether an institution'sdecision to purchase or sell Freddie Mac preferred stock may have adverseconsequences for the institution and ultimately the FSLIC as insurer ofthe institution. The Board believes that the elimination of the ownership and transferabilityrestrictions that had previously applied to Freddie Mac preferred stockmay subject the value of those securities to increased market fluctuations.This could, in turn, have a significant impact on the financial conditionof insured institutions holding such stock. To the extent that institutionscan immediately increase their holdings of Freddie Mac preferred stock,the results of potential market fluctuations in the value of this stocktake on more significant consequences. With the removal of the previous Freddie Mac restriction significantlylimiting the amount any single holder of preferred stock could own, insuredinstitutions can immediately double their holdings of Freddie Mac preferredstock. At the same time, the value of this stock may be subject to unprecedentedvolatility. The capital position of institutions that are not presentlymeeting their minimum capital requirement may be particularly vulnerableto these variations. The Board believes that before such institutions cansignificantly alter their holdings of Freddie Mac preferred stock, theremust be an opportunity for the institution's Principal Supervisory Agentto evaluate the potential impact resulting from a change in the level ofthis type of investment. Although the Freddie Mac action does not contemplatethat this preferred stock will be available for sale to the public untilJanuary 1, 1989, in the interim the Board recognizes that intra-industrypurchases and sales among institutions with impaired capital could detrimentallyaffect the sound operation of such institutions.The temporary rule that the Board adopts today will prevent institutionsthat do not meet their minimum regulatory capital requirement under andSection;andSection;563.13and 563.14 from buying or selling Freddie Mac preferred stock without firstobtaining written approval from the PSA or his designee, subject to theconcurrence of the Office of Regulatory Activities.The rule requires that institutions not meeting their minimum capital requirementmust submit written applications to their PSAs. It sets forth general factorsto be considered by the PSAs when evaluating an institution's applicationto buy or sell Freddie Mac preferred stock. In making a written applicationto buy or sell Freddie Mac preferred stock, such institutions will be requiredto demonstrate the effect that the proposed transaction will have on theiroverall asset composition. Factors that are to be addressed in applicationsinclude, but are not limited to, the effect the proposed transactions willhave on an institution's future growth, its risk exposure, and its portfoliodiversification. The PSA may require an institution to include in its applicationany additional information that the PSA may consider relevant to evaluatingportfolio risk in connection with the purchase or sale of Freddie Mac preferredstock. If the institution proposes to sell its shares of Freddie Mac preferredstock, it must indicate in its application the manner in which the resultingproceeds are to be used. Moreover, it must comply with any conditions imposedby the PSA.Separate and apart from the restrictions applying to those insured institutionsnot meeting their minimum capital requirements, the Board believes thatcertain restrictions may be appropriate for institutions not currentlymeeting their fully phased-in capital requirements as set forth in 12 CFR563.13 and 12 CFR 563.14. The Board believes that supervisory input isimportant before such institutions declare dividends, or take other similaractions as a result of any gains on any sale of Freddie Mac stock becausesuch actions may potentially delay the date institutions attain their fullyphased-in capital requirements. As noted above, the Board continues tobelieve that it is in the best interests of insured institutions, theirdepositors, and the FSLIC fund that all insured institutions move as quicklyas is reasonable to reach their fully phased-in capital levels. Furthermore,given that the gains on the sale of Freddie Mac preferred stock are notlikely to be recurring income, the Board believes that such gains shouldbe used to augment capital. Therefore, it has determined that institutionsnot meeting their fully phased-in capital requirement that sell sharesof Freddie Mac preferred stock must exclude the gain on the sale of theseshares from earnings in calculating allowable dividends under the Board'sregulations unless prior approval is obtained from their PSA, with theconcurrence of the Office of Regulatory Activities. Additionally, becausecertain other actions in connection with gains from the sale of FreddieMac preferred stock, such as implementation of a stock repurchase programmay have identical adverse consequences on or for an institution's financialcondition and may delay the institution's attainment of its fully phased-incapital requirement, the Board has determined to require the same priorapproval of such action. <T3>Cf.</T3> Board Res. No. 88-31, 53 FR 2477 (January 28, 1988) (restrictionson repurchase of stock of recently converted insured institutions).The Board has therefore determined that immediate action is required toensure that institutions that are failing their regulatory capital requirementbuy and sell Freddie Mac preferred stock in a manner consistent with principlesof safety and soundness and that adequate supervisory input is providedbefore institutions take certain actions as a result of gains from anysale of Freddie Mac stock that might adversely affect their ability toattain their fully phased-in capital requirements as expeditiously as possible.The Board also believes, however, that public comment on today's rule willbe useful in shaping any permanent rule that it may determine to adoptupon expiration of this temporary rule. It therefore requests public commenton the temporary regulation adopted today. Comments received will be takeninto account in determining the scope of any final regulation that theBoard may adopt.The Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553(b), (d)(3), provides thatthe general provisions requiring notice and comment and a delay in theeffective date of a substantive regulation do not apply when an agencydetermines that the public interest would not be served by notice and commentbefore agency action and that good cause for dispensing with the delayin effective date exists and is published with the rule. As set forth elsewherein this <T2>supplementary information,</T2> the Board believes that in order topreserve its ability to supervise institutions with impaired capital, itsPrincipal Supervisory Agents must be able to act promptly to monitor thedecision by any such institution to purchase or sell Freddie Mac preferredstock. It also believes that a lesser degree of supervisory input is equallyimportant in order to assure that insured institutions not currently meetingtheir fully phased-in capital requirements move as expeditiously as possibletoward that target. It anticipates that it will have adequate time, duringthe period this temporary rule is in effect, to review any comments receivedduring the comment period and any other supervisory information regardingthese institutions to determine the most effective way of affording suchinstitutions managerial flexibility in this area consistent with the Board'ssupervisory concerns. The Board therefore finds that good cause existsfor dispensing with a delayed effective date.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Analysis</ITAG>Pursuant to section 3 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 604,the Board is providing the following regulatory flexibility analysis:1. Need For and Objectives of the Rule.These elements are incorporated above in <T2>supplementary information.</T2>2. <T3>Issues Raised by Comments and Agency Assessment and Response</T3>These elements will be considered by the Board in reviewing any commentsreceived and will be fully addressed in any final regulation.3. Significant Alternatives Minimizing Small Entity Impact and Agency ResponseThe Small Business Administration defines a small financial institutionas ``a commercial bank or savings and loan association, the assets of which,for the preceding fiscal year, do not exceed $100 million.'' 13 CFR 121.13(a).This temporary regulation will only affect those small savings and loanassociations that are not currently meeting their fully phased-in regulatorycapital requirement. The Board believes that the temporary rule providesthe least burdensome alternative available for addressing the Board's supervisoryconcern about the safe and sound operation of such insured institutionsin this area. The Board will consider any alternatives presented in commentsaddressing this concern.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 563</ITAG>Bank deposit insurance, Investments, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements,Savings and loan associations.<ITAG tagnum="76">SUBCHAPTER D_FEDERAL SAVINGS AND LOAN INSURANCE CORPORATION</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">PART 563_OPERATIONS</ITAG>1.
