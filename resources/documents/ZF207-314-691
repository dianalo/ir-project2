Searcy that the commission keep secret the otherversion of the tariff filing, which contains FTS 2000 pricing information.andM;&quot;The two versions are identical in all respects, except that pricesapplicable to FTS 2000 have been deleted from one version,&quot; Lind said, addingthat &quot;ATandamp;T proposes to file on the public record and otherwise publish onlythe redacted version.&quot;andM;Requiring ATandamp;T to publish full pricing information would hurt it in rebiddingwhile giving the company no advantages, Lind said.andM;Although ATandamp;T and US Sprint Communications Co. of Kansas City, Mo., split theFTS 2000 contract on a 60-40 basis, the General Services Administration hasstructured the deal to let either of the companies increase its share of thecontract at the expense of the other when it is rebid at the end of thefourth and seventh years.andM;The ATandamp;T tariff filing also disclosed that losing bidder Martin MariettaCorp. and Martin Marietta team member MCI also have filed Freedom ofInformation Act requests with the GSA to get the pricing information.andP;  ButGSA, the filing said, has &quot;indicated that it intends to deny at least thoseportions of the applications addressed to ATandamp;T's FTS 2000 prices.&quot;andM;The filing did not say how GSA communicated its intent to deny those portionsof the FOIA requests.andM;ATandamp;T's lack of full disclosure in the public version of the tariff filingelicited a terse statement from MCI.andP;  &quot;Our reaction to ATandamp;T's filing issimple -- they have not complied with the law.andP;  The Communications Actclearly calls for the filing of rates.andP;  If those rates are not public, itcannot be considered a tariff,&quot; the statement said.andM;MCI officials already have laid the groundwork for challenging ATandamp;T's FTS2000 rates by urging that the FCC reject outright a tariff that ATandamp;T filed inconnection with a small Defense Department contract awarded ATandamp;T lastNovember to supply telecommunications service to military installations inHawaii.andP;  ATandamp;T wants that tariff, called Tariff 16, established specificallyto cover competitively bid government contracts.andM;MCI now appears to have set the stage to force ATandamp;T to disclose its FTS 2000rates, either through a challenge before the FCC or by taking the issue tocourt.andP;  ATandamp;T, unlike other long-haul common carriers such as MCI and USSprint, must have FCC approval for the prices it charges fortelecommunications services.andM;Joaquin Gonzalez, a vice president of the Aries Group Inc., a Rockville, Md.,andO;telecommunications consulting company, predicted ATandamp;T would find it difficultto keep FTS 2000 rates secret.andP;  &quot;I've got to believe that ultimately theeffort to keep the cost-per-call-minute rates secret will not succeed,&quot; hesaid.andM;&quot;ATandamp;T doesn't want their large accounts to know how low they went to assurethe business.andP;  You could say there's a curse associated with FTS 2000 ifyou're ATandamp;T.andP;  Now people want to know how low you can go,&quot; Gonzalez said.andM;The ATandamp;T filing said other users of telecommunications services have nolegitimate need to know those rates &quot;because the FTS 2000 service is offeredsolely to the government and is not available to other customers.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
