The slight change of FWHM of Sn(IV), observed in ITO films,was attributed to the presence of the acid-insoluble segregated SnO/sub2/ and the acid-soluble Sn(IV) that is incorporated in the In/sub 2/O/sub3/ lattice. A good correlation was found between the area intensitiesof a doublet and a singlet and the ratios of acid-soluble Sn(IV) to acid-insolubleSn(IV). The peaks of acid-soluble Sn(IV) in ITO were deconvoluted totwo doublets corresponding to different sites. The results suggestedthat Sn(IV) atoms were preferentially substituted to the centers of trigonallydistorted octahedra (site b) rather than to the centers of more distortedoctahedra (site d).</TEXT></DOC>
