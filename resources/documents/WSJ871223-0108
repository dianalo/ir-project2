In a sternly worded letter dated Dec. 15, Rep. Fernand St Germain, chairman of the House Banking Committee, and Rep. Chalmers P. Wylie (R., Ohio), the panel's ranking GOP member, cautioned Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan against taking any action on the proposal.    They argued in their letter that the rule, if adopted, &quot;could further exacerbate an extraordinarily difficult situation&quot; for the beleaguered thrift industry and would hamper the Federal Home Loan Bank Board's efforts to save failing thrifts.    Separately, equally vehement statements of opposition were sent by Sen. William Proxmire (D., Wis.), chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, and Rep. Frank Annunzio (D., Ill.) chairman of the House Banking Committee's consumer affairs subcommittee. They warned Mr. Greenspan that the rule proposal would undercut the $10.8 billion recapitalization of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., which insures thrift deposits. Specifically, these lawmakers expressed concern that the Fed proposal would prompt healthy thrifts to desert the FSLIC for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which charges lower premiums.    &quot;That (recapitalization) plan was predicated on having a large number of healthy institutions to build up the premium base in the insurance fund,&quot; Rep. Annunzio wrote.    Since 1982, federal law has permitted banking companies to purchase failing thrifts with federal assistance and to continue operating them as savings and loan institutions. But the Fed generally hasn't allowed bank holding companies to operate healthy thrifts because of conflicting regulations for banks and thrifts.    The lawmakers' concern is that if banks are allowed to acquire healthy thrifts, they would convert the thrifts to banks in order to switch to the FDIC for insurance. That same concern led lawmakers to include in the FSLIC bailout plan, which was adopted earlier this year, a provision banning thrifts for one year from leaving the FSLIC.    Fed spokesman declined to comment on whether the lawmakers' criticism of the proposal would dissuade the agency from proceeding with its proposed rule. Mr. Greenspan has assured Sen. Proxmire that his views will be given &quot;serious consideration,&quot; the spokesman said. The other congressional letters, filed along with some 200 public comments on the proposed rule, haven't yet been answered.    Lawmakers also complained that the Fed's proposal would leave bank holding companies with little incentive to acquire sick thrifts from the FSLIC. &quot;It would be much harder for the FSLIC (officials) to solicit bids from bank holding companies for their supervisory cases if the door is opened for such companies to acquire healthy thrifts,&quot; Sen. Proxmire wrote.    The thrift industry is split on the Fed's proposal. The U.S. League of Savings Institutions, the industry's main trade group, argues that allowing bank holding companies to acquire healthy thrifts would &quot;gradually diminish&quot; the thrifts' role as home-mortgage lenders.    But John Rousselot, president of the smaller National Council of Savings Institutions, which represents more deregulation-minded thrifts, said that his group supports the proposal as &quot;another way to bolster the capital of savings and loans.&quot; David Jeffers, a spokesman for the group, added, however, &quot;We don't expect to win on this one,&quot; primarily because lawmakers are very sensitive about any perceived threat to the FSLIC recapitalization. </TEXT></DOC>
