A total of 144 birds have been sighted at the Aransas NationalWildlife Refuge near Rockport, where they spend the winter beforereturning to their nesting grounds in Canada's Buffalo NationalPark, said Brent Giezentanner, refuge manager.   ``We're really happy. As a matter of fact, we're ecstatic sofar,'' he said Wednesday.   Only 138 whooping cranes out of an expected 150 made it to therefuge last year. Biologists estimated that as many as a dozenbirds may have died after leaving their Canadian habitat.   One bird was shot by a Houston lawyer, who paid a $15,000 fine,Giezentanner said.   A good sign this year is that of the 21 whooping crane chickssighted and tagged in Canada, all but one made it to the Texasrefuge.   The increase in the world's only remaining naturally reproducingflock of whooping cranes is the result of favorable nestingconditions in Canada and the fact that many of the birds arereaching breeding age, Giezentanner said.</TEXT></DOC>
