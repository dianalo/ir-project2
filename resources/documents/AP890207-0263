ROSENBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A bevy of positive developments, most notably anincrease in General Motors' dividend, reinvigorated Wall StreetTuesday and sent stock prices sharply higher.   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 26.07 to 2,347.14,its highest close since the October 1987 crash. The last time theaverage closed higher was Oct. 15, 1987, two trading days before thecrash, when it stood at 2,355.09.   Advancing issues outnumbered declilners by about 11 to 4 innationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with1,095 stocks rising, 425 falling and 461 unchanged.   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 217.26 millionshares, up from 150.98 million in the previous session.   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, includingtrades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in theover-the-counter market, totaled 264.07 million shares.   Analysts said a variety of factors revived the market after afive-session pause.   A major impetus came from GM's announcement that it was splittingits stock and sharply raising its dividend. Analysts said theautomaker's action indicated the company had confidence in themarket, and its optimism proved to be infectious.   GM, a component of the Dow Jones industrial average, soared 4] to93~ in heavy trading. The jump accounted for 6.25 points of the gainin the Dow Jones average.   Another surging stock that lent support to the rest of the marketwas Union Carbide, which jumped 2[ to 30[ and was the most activelytraded issue on the NYSE.   Carbide, often the subject of takeover rumors, was once againsaid to be a target, but analysts said a chunk of the buying Tuesdaycame from investors who wanted to take advantage of the chemicalcompany's upcoming dividend.   Jack Baker, a market analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.,said Wall Street had expected the Federal Reserve to raise itsdiscount rate Tuesday, but when the anticipated hike failed tomaterialize, stocks rallied further.   Other factors contributing to the advance were the vote byCongress to kill a pay raise for House and Senate members and topBush administration officials, and positive reaction to PresidentBush's announcement Monday of a bailout plan for the savings andloan industry.   ``You couldn't get much more positive news across the board,''Baker said.   Some of Wall Street's recent gains have come from its own upwardmomentum as investors have jumped into the market to avoid missingthe rally.   Such was the case again Tuesday, said Alfred E. Goldman, a marketanalyst with A.G. Edwards andamp; Sons Inc. in St. Louis.   Tuesday's developments ``created all kinds of intestinal problemsfor those on the sidelines,'' Goldman said.   Goldman said the market appeared to have returned to an upwardtrack following its pause, which included a 10-point drop in the DowJones industrial average on Monday.   ``The market was ripe for a good rally,'' he said, and predictedmore gains before the president delivers his budget message toCongress in a speech Thursday night.   Big gainers Tuesday included Ford Motor, up 1[ to 55~, and IBM,up 1 to 127|.   A big loser was Burlington Resources, which fell 2} to 46]. OnMonday, the stock soared 10 points after Pennzoil said it acquired 8percent of the company's shares.   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000actively traded stocks, the market rose $30.09 billion, or 1.03percent, in value.   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose1.83 to 168.02.   Standard andamp; Poor's industrial index closed up 3.82 to 346.41, andSandamp;P's 500-stock composite index rose 3.59 to 299.63.   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market was up3.19 to 409.19. At the American Stock Exchange, the market valueindex picked up 1.90 to close at 326.38.</TEXT></DOC>
