The inspector general, in a long-awaited 25-page report, saidlaboratory and field testing had established that high levels ofelectro-magnetic energy _ such as radio or radar transmissions _can affect the flight control systems of the Blackhawk.   The question, the Pentagon's independent auditor continued, iswhether such radio interference can become severe enough to causeone of the choppers to crash.   The Army ``has determined that electro-magnetic interference isnot a safety of flight issue,'' the inspector general noted. ``Butthe Army Safety Center seems to have taken a different position.   ``It stated that while electro-magnetic interference has notbeen demonstrated to be a safety of flight issue, it has not beendefinitively ruled out ... We agree with the position of the ArmySafety Center that test data available to date are not sufficientlyconclusive ...   ``A negative safety of flight determination ... has been madeprematurely.''   The audit report also went on to criticize the Army's handlingof the problem, disclosing:</TEXT><TEXT>   _Army investigators have never identified electro-magneticinterference ``as a cause of, or even a contributing factor in, anyaccident in the aircraft reviewed.''   _The Army has been slow in addressing the Blackhawk's problemswith radio interference and is now pursuing a questionable approachto solving the matter.   Most of the testing to date has involved only simulatedconditions, and the Army appears to be planning assembly lineimprovements that would address only those problems that havecropped up to date.   ``Thus, the Army appears to be concentrating on the symptom andignoring the illness,'' the auditors wrote. ``Testing has not beensufficient or timely.''   _The Army could have obtained detailed technical and costinformation on what it takes to harden the Blackhawk's systemsagainst radio interference from the Navy two years ago _ but failedto do so.   The Navy, which uses a variant known as the SH-60 Seahawk, hasspecified a level of protection against interference that is 10times greater than the Army's, the auditors said.   The release of the inspector general's report comes just a weekafter the Army announced it was accelerating plans to shield onekey control system of the Blackhawk against interference.   Maj. Phil Soucy, an Army spokesman, said the service intended tostudy the new report closely but he disputed some of the report'sconclusions.   ``The report implies that we have been suppressingrecommendations from the safety center,'' Soucy said.   ``Our approach to this has been anything but cavalier. Thedirector of the safety center has supported our approach and wehave moved as expeditiously as the evidence allowed. And anysuggestion the Army is placing dollars in front of safety is agross error.''   The Blackhawk is a twin-engine, single-rotor helicopter that isreplacing the aging UH-1 Huey copters of the Vietnam era as theArmy's primary air assault and air cavalry craft.   Last November, Knight-Ridder Newspapers reported investigatorswere convinced radio wave interference had caused five Blackhawkaccidents since 1982, killing 22 servicemen. The Army and theaircraft's maker, the Sikorsky Aircraft unit of the UnitedTechnologies Corp., denied that report.</TEXT></DOC>
