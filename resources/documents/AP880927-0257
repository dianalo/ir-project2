But as the late naturalist Dian Fossey in``Gorillas in the Mist,'' she has outdone herself.   In earlier films she battled outer space demons (``Alien,''``Aliens''), revolution (``The Year of Living Dangerously'') andevil spirits (``Ghostbusters''). The new movie shows her inconditions of genuine peril: working with silverback gorillas inthe mountain jungles of Rwanda without a double or net _ nothingbetween her and a beast that could crush her in an instant.   Fossey was murdered in Rwanda in her sleep. Her colleagues, whoconsidered her an eccentric, said she had angered local residentswith her aggressive efforts to restrict poaching.   Weaver, 38, was born into the entertainment business. Her fatheris Sylvester (Pat) Weaver, the NBC president considered to be thearchitect of modern television. Her mother is the former actressElizabeth Inglis. After Stanford University and the Yale School ofDrama, she worked her way from off-Broadway to films.   On a recent visit from her New York home, she talked about herAfrican experience in an interview with The Associated Press.   Q. You don't pick easy pictures, do you?   A. (laughing) That's probably true. My father says that if Iopen a script and it takes place in Alaska with a lot of huskiesand I fall through the ice, I'll probably do it instead of a lovelypicture on the French Riviera.   Q. Did you know about Dian Fossey and her work?   A. I had gotten her book when it first came out. I had also beenat Stanford when they started that human-primate program where youcould live with an ape in your trailer and do your thesis on it.Jane Goodall had come and spoken to us.   After I read Dian's book (``Gorillas in the Mist'') I thought,``They can't make a picture out of this; she is too difficult awoman to be portrayed on the screen.'' I also thought logisticallyit would be a nightmare. How could you possibly create the wholeatmosphere of the gorillas?   Q. Were you involved in the joining of Universal and WarnerBros. (which had competing projects)?   A. No. I was approached by each studio separately. By the time(producer) Arnie Glimcher approached me for Universal, I said,``Arnie, I don't want to get involved with a picture that's notgoing to happen.'' I thought they would knock each other out.   Q. Once the deal was made, weren't you overwhelmed by the dangerinvolved?   A. Not really. I was reading a lot of Dian's papers andrereading her book, and it seemed that she was often threatened bygorillas, but they never actually hurt her. It was all a questionof getting to know each other.   I didn't see why they would feel animosity toward me. That was alucky choice on my part. I don't think it would be wise go in andto work with animals without having previously reassured yourselfthat you would be all right.   I was intimidated by trying to gather all the information aboutDian. So much of it was conflicting. And so much of it was hearsay.She had a very negative reputation within her field, and she wasconsidered to be a very difficult woman. I heard people say somepretty hard things about her. And some very loving things as well.   Q. What kind of a person was she?   A. She was a mass of opposites, I think. Everything you can sayabout Dian, the opposite is probably true. She loved people, sheloved partying. ... On the other hand she shunned people, shepreferred to be with animals. She lived up in this isolated place,tramping around in mud, yet she loved to go out in fancy clothes.She always slept with curlers in her hair, even when she lived upon top of the mountain.   She is such an amazing collection of different things. I guess Igrew very fond of her. I was lucky to have access to her lettersand her camp notes through a colleague of hers. She really putherself in those letters. I developed such an admiration for herthoroughness, her commitment, her humor _ she was always makingjokes about herself. She had a wicked sense of humor, and I hopethat comes across in the film.   Q. Did you train for the rigors of the location?   A. In the press release, it says I ran up these volcanicmountains in Hawaii. (laughing) I don't know where they got that. Idid walk up a hill behind my parents-in-law's house in Hawaii everymorning for about two weeks. I don't think any of us could havegotten in shape for (the location). You had to get used to thealtitude and slowly get used to the climbs. It was difficult foreveryone except the Australians; they were very macho about thewhole thing.   You were in such a beautiful part of the world and you wereperhaps going to see gorillas at the end of the climb or you weregoing to the top of the mountain to shoot a scene.   Q. What was your first encounter with the gorillas?   A. We didn't think we were going to see gorillas that day. Itturned out they were only 5 minutes away from Dian's camp. We tookoff through a beautiful forest filled with wild orchids. We heard agreat outburst of pock-pock sounds, which is the sound they makebeating their chests. I looked up and saw this big gorilla standinghalfway up the hill.   You're so amazed to suddenly be in their territory; it was likeyou had walked into another era. I just forgot, I was so entranced.It was like walking into a forest and seeing a unicorn. You forgotyour fear, you just went ahead.   I went up to where they were all sitting around munching, thoughI couldn't see them. This little gorilla came out to me and satdown and touched my camera. She was very curious, taking me in in amatter-of-fact way. She jumped away after she had visited, and Iwas agog. It was an indescribable feeling.   I just found out last week that that sweet little girl had beencaught in a poacher's trap ... and she didn't make it. There aren'tmany females, and coming from a very good family, she would havebeen a good mate.   Q. Were you well-coached on how to behave with the gorillas?   A. I kind of learned it as I went along. In the picture are acouple of scary scenes where the silverback comes down right nextto me. They all happened the first times we went out. So I was kindof thrown into the deep end.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Oct. 7-9</NOTE></DOC>
