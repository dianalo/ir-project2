The 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countriesthree times postponed what was expected to be a final round oftalks to consider a new Iranian proposal. Talks were to resumeWednesday evening.   ``It has to cook some,'' Iraqi Oil Minister Issam al-Chalabisaid of the Iranian plan.   But Libya immediately threw cold water on the idea. ``We willnot accept it,'' insisted a senior Libyan delegate, who demandedanonymity.   Earlier, Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh said hiscountry had offered a plan to raise the production ceiling in thelast quarter of the year. Iran suggested hiking the cap to between20.5 million barrels a day and 21 million barrels.   The ministers talks have centered on raising the production capfrom the current 19.5 million barrel limit to a level between 20million barrels a day and 21 million barrels, according todelegates.   The additional amount under the Iranian plan would be dividedunder a formula that would meet the demands of Gabon, the UnitedArab Emirates, Kuwait, Ecuador and Qatar for bigger shares of theproduction pie.   All countries would get larger individual quotas, meaning theycould pump more in the last quarter than now but some would seetheir percentage share of the total output shrink.   ``It seems (there will be) a little increase,'' said a seniormember of one delegation, who demanded anonymity. ``But we stillhave different positions. It's a slow process.''   ``There are some members that are still taking a very hardline,'' said another delegate, also on condition of anonymity.   The meeting began Saturday with the delegates arguing overwhether the market was strong enough to absorb an increase inproduction without sending prices tumbling.   The cartel has been overproducing, pumping more crude thanallowed under an output agreement signed in June. Analysts'estimate OPEC production at about 22 million barrels daily.   Gasoline prices at the pump were likely to remain about the sameor even fall a few cents in the long term if production wereincreased, according to analysts.   The average price of a basket of crudes monitored by OPEC wasrecently about $1 under the cartel's benchmark of $18 a 42-gallonbarrel. West Texas Intermediate, the major American grade, has beentrading at about $19.50 to $20 a barrel.   The ministers were reported close to an agreement Monday but raninto trouble getting all countries to sign on to the deal.   Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have been producing wellbeyond their individual quotas in an effort to press their case forhigher shares. Others countries, though, are unwilling to give into those two nations and want any increase shared proportionately.   Analysts say Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have beenproducing as much as double their quotas of about 1 million barrelseach.   The ministers could extend the current ceiling until the end ofthe year. But analysts say that might leave the impression ofdisarray in the cartel's ranks. It also could prompt some countriesto widen their taps to take advantage of the firm market.   OPEC has predicted that demand in the final quarter will be 22million barrels a day.   The ministers are to meet again in late November to hammer out aproduction pact for the first six months of 1990.   This week's talks were officially held by a monitoring panelmade up of Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Nigeria, SaudiArabia and Venezuela. The other OPEC members _ Gabon, Ecuador,Libya, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates _ were invited to attend.</TEXT></DOC>
