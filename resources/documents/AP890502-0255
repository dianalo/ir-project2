Gordon. Under suchprograms, accumulated miles flown can be cashed in for free flightsor service upgrades.   The lawsuit filed in March 1987 alleged that United was unfairwhen it increased mileage requirements for some awards in January1987. Most original rules were reinstated in July of that year. AUnited spokesman said the old rules were restored due to consumercomplaints and competitive reasons, not because of the lawsuit.   In mailings last week, United provided applications for thosewho believe they may be entitled to more program credits.   Under the 1987 changes, for example, mileage required to earnone free first-class ticket to Hawaii was raised to 60,000 from50,000.   The settlement to the Cook County Circuit Court case was reachedin December 1988, said United spokeswoman Sara Dornacker, whospeculated that attorneys may have delayed the announcement becauseof similar lawsuits against two other carriers, American and DeltaAirlines.   The 1987 United changes applied to new members, as well as toqualified members who had already accumulated the necessary mileagefor such awards under the old program.   Lawyers estimate that only a small portion of United's 5 millionMileage Plus program members would be eligible for extra credit.   ``The resolution depends on each individual case,'' Ms.Dornacker said. ``No direct compensation is being made to theflyers in cash.''   Attorney Michael J. Freed said lawsuits against American andDelta are still in Cook County Circuit Court. Freed contends thatchanges in the frequent flyers programs by American and Deltaconstitute a breach of contract and a violation of the Illinois law.   Gordon said American has set up limits on the number of peoplewho can claim free trips on some flights, while Delta has designedsuch capacity restrictions, but hasn't instituted them.   Spokeswomen for Delta and American said they couldn't comment onpending litigation.</TEXT></DOC>
