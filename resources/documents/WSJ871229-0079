Even this late in the year, individuals who help support their parents may be able to lower their taxes by ensuring that the parents qualify as dependents.    Financial advisers say taxpayers should take time before the end of the year to evaluate how much of their parents' total expenses they've paid this year. A last-minute contribution might boost their share to more than 50%, which could entitle them to exemptions for supporting one or both parents. Tax rules permit individuals to claim other relatives -- a mother-in-law, for example -- as dependents, too.    Parents who are claimed as dependents can't take deductions for themselves, however. And if a child claims one parent as a dependent, the parents can't file a joint return, except to claim a refund. Rates for couples filing jointly are lower than for those filing separately.    For parents to qualify as dependents, certain requirements have to be met regarding the parent's income and the level of financial support provided by the child. Generally, the parent's annual gross income, excluding tax-exempt income, can't exceed $1,900. But a parent who had more than $1,900 in gross income this year might still qualify if the child paid at least half of the parent's actual living expenses, and the parent's income above $1,900 was tax-exempt income or Social Security that went into savings.    In families where several children share the cost of caring for parents, only one is entitled to claim a parent as a dependent. But a special rule applies in situations where no one child pays more than half the support. As long as each child pays at least 10% of the parent's expenses -- and together the children give more than half -- &quot;they can sign a multiple-support agreement among themselves that allows one of them to claim the exemption,&quot; says Sidney Kess, a tax partner at New York-based accounting firm Peat Marwick Main andamp; Co.    Also, unmarried children with dependent parents may be eligible to file their taxes as heads of households, rather than single taxpayers, even though the parents don't live with them. The rates for heads of households are lower than for taxpayers who file as single individuals. For example, the 1987 top rate of 38.5% kicks in at $54,001 for single people; for heads of households, that rate doesn't apply until income reaches $80,001.    Giving parents income-producing securities -- such as taxable bonds -- instead of cash, can also help meet the 50% support requirement, if the interest is used for living expenses. Moreover, such gifts could reduce future taxes by shifting income to family members in lower tax brackets.    The tax-law overhaul passed last year ruled out that kind of income-shifting to children under 14 years old. &quot;But the technique still works with parents who are retired and probably paying lower rates,&quot; says Malcolm Gissen, a financial planner in San Francisco.    Moreover, the tax law allows the child to give a generous amount -- $10,000 a year -- to a dependent without paying a gift tax on the cash or securities. &quot;I could give my father $10,000 of bonds tax free, my mother $10,000, and my wife could also do the same,&quot; he says.    Mr. Kess says individuals also can save taxes by giving securities to a parent rather than selling the securities and taking a capital gain. Although the securities might increase in value from the time the gift is made until the parent dies -- and thus could be inherited at a higher value than when given to the parent -- no one would pay a tax on the appreciation.    Other possible tax savings can stem from the parent's medical expenses. Children who claim a parent as a dependent can add the parent's medical expenses to their own to help meet the new, higher requirement for medical deductions. Starting this year, only medical expenses that exceed 7.5% of adjusted gross income are deductible, up from 5% for 1986.    An individual who is just shy of the amount needed to claim the medical deduction for 1987 might want to prepay some of the parent's expenses that aren't due until next year, such as medical expenses included in the cost of a nursing home. Mr. Kess warns, however, that &quot;you have to get a breakdown of how much of any payment you make will actually go for medical care.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
