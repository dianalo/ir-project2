In compliance with the filingrequirements of andSection; 355.26 of the Commerce Regulations (19 CFR 355.12),the petition alleges that manufacturers, producers, or exporters in Malaysiaof steel nails receive bounties or grants within the meaning of section303 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (``the Act'').Malaysia is not a ``country under the Agreement'' within the meaning ofsection 701(b) of the Act, and the merchandise being investigated is dutiable.Therefore, sections 303 (a)(1) and (b) of the Act apply to this investigation.Accordingly, petitioner is not required to allege that, and the U.S. InternationalTrade Commission is not required to determine whether, imports of the subjectmerchandise materially injure, or threaten material injury to, a U.S. industry.<ITAG tagnum="84">Initiation of Investigation</ITAG>Under section 702(c) of the Act, we must determine, within 20 days aftera petition is filed, whether the petition sets forth the allegations necessaryfor the initiation of a countervailing duty investigation, and whetherit contains information reasonably available to the petitioner supportingthe allegations. We have examined the petition on steel nails from Malaysiaand have found that it meets the requirements of section 702(b) of theAct. Therefore, we are initiating a countervailing duty investigation todetermine whether manufacturers, producers, or exporters in Malaysia ofsteel nails, as described in the ``Scope of Investigation'' section ofthis notice, receive benefits which constitute bounties or grants withinthe meaning of the Act. If our investigation proceeds normally, we willmake our preliminary determination on or before June 15, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of Investigation</ITAG>The United States has developed a system of tariff classification basedon the international harmonized system of customs nomenclature. On January1, 1989, the U.S. tariff schedules were fully converted to the <T3>Harmonized Tariff Schedule </T3>(HTS), as provided for in section 1201<T3>et seq.</T3> of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988.All merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption onor after that date is now classified solely according to the appropriateHTS sub-headings. The HTS sub-headings are provided for convenience andCustoms purposes. The written description remains dispositive.The products covered by this investigation are certain steel wire nailsfrom Malaysia. These nails are: steel wire nails of one-piece constructionas currently provided for in HTS items 7317.00.5505, 7317.00.5510, 7317.00.5520,7317.00.5530, 7317.00.5540, 7317.00.5550, 7317.00.5560, 7317.00.5570, 7317.00.5580,7317.00.5590 and 7317.00.6560; steel wire nails of two-piece construction,as currently provided for in HTS item 7317.00.7500; and steel wire nailswith lead heads, as currently provided for in HTS item 7317.00.7500.<ITAG tagnum="84">Allegation of Bounties or Grants</ITAG>The petition lists certain practices by the Government of Malaysia whichallegedly confer bounties or grants on manufacturers, producers, or exportersin Malaysia of steel nails. We are initiating an investigation of the followingprograms:andbullet; Export Tax Incentives<ITAG tagnum="15">_Abatement of Taxable Income Based on the Ratio of Export Sales toTotal Sales</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Abatement of Five Percent of the Value of Indigenous Materials Usedin Exports</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Double Deduction for Export Credit Insurance Payments</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Double Deduction for Export Promotion Expenses</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Industrial Building Allowance</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Residual Benefits From the Allowance of a Percentage of Net TaxableIncome Based on the FOB Value of Export Sales Under Section 29 of the InvestmentIncentives Act (IIA) of 1968</ITAG>andbullet; Export Credit Refinancingandbullet; Official Export Insurance Program Administered by the MalaysianCredit Export Insurance Behard (MECIB)andbullet; Pioneer Status Under the IIA of 1968andbullet; Investment Tax Allowance for Under Chapter 2 of the PIA of 1986andbullet; Long-Term Loans From the Development Bank of Malaysia for <T3>Bumiputras</T3> (people of native Malaysian descent)andbullet; Double Deduction for Operational Expensesandbullet; Other Tax Incentives<ITAG tagnum="15">_Abatement of Five Percent of the Adjusted Income for a Period ofFive Years for Manufacturing Companies Located in Designated ``PromotedIndustrial Areas''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Reinvestment Allowance</ITAG>Although not specifically alleged by petitioners, we are also investigatingwhether the manufacturers and exporters of steel nails in Malaysia receivecountervailable benefits under the following programs, which we have foundto be either countervailable or not used in previous Malaysian investigations:andbullet; Abatement of Taxable Income of Five Percent for Trading and AgriculturalCompanies Exporting Malaysian-made Productsandbullet; Pioneer Status under the PIA of 1986andbullet; Other Medium- and Long-Term Government Financing from:<ITAG tagnum="15">_The Industrial Development Bank of Malaysia (IDBM)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_The Borneo Development Corporation (BDC)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_The Sabar Development Bank (SDB)</ITAG>We are not initiating an investigation of the following allegations madeby the petitioner:andbullet; Abatement of Taxable Income Based on a Percentage of the Value-Addedof Exported ProductsThis program was determined not to exist in <T3>Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: Carbon Steel Wirefrom Malaysia</T3> (53 FR 13303, April 22, 1988) (<T3>Wire Rod II</T3>).andbullet; Upstream subsidy allegationPetitioners allege that an upstream subsidy is conferred upon producersand exporters of steel nails in Malaysia, based, in part, on the Department'sprevious affirmative determination in <T3>Wire Rod II.</T3>Under section 701(e) of the Act, whenever the Department has reasonablegrounds to believe or suspect that an upstream subsidy is being paid orbestowed, the Department must investigate whether an upstream subsidy hasin fact been paid or bestowed. The standard established in section 355.12of the Commerce Regulations (19 CFR 355.12(b)(8)) states that petitionermust provide the following factual information regarding an alleged upstreamsubsidy:<ITAG tagnum="21">(i) Domestic subsidies described in section 771(5) of the Act thatthe government of the affected country provides to the upstream supplier;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) The competitive benefit the subsidies bestow on the merchandise;and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(iii) The significant effect the subsidies have on the cost of producingthe merchandise.</ITAG>Petitioners cite the Department's final determination in <T3>Wire Rod II</T3> to support the allegation that the input to nailsis subsidized. Petitioners also provide information regarding significanteffect. However, petitioners have not provided any supporting informationwhich indicates that a competitive benefit is bestowed on the producersof steel nails.Petitioners state that the Department's previous finding in <T3>Wire Rod II</T3> and the fact that the Malaysian steel nails producersundersell their U.S. counterparts demonstrates the bestowal of a competitivebenefit. However, this argument is insufficient for purposes of demonstratingthe bestowal of a competitive benefit.Instead, petitioners must provide evidence which indicates that the pricefor wire rod paid by the Malaysian nail producers is lower than an arm'slength unsubsidized price. We therefore conclude that petitioners havenot provided the Department with a reasonable basis to believe or suspectthat producers and exporters of steel nails in Malaysia benefit from anupstream subsidy.This notice is published pursuant to section 702(c)(2) of the Act.<ITAG tagnum="6">Timothy N.
