LEDERER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A passenger train struck the back of another trainoutside London on Saturday, sending rail cars careening into theyards of nearby homes and killing at least five people, police said.At least 80 people were hurt.   Earlier death tolls in the capital's second major rail accidentin less than three months ran as high as 12 but could not beconfirmed.   Scotland Yard put the confirmed death toll at five dead and 80injured. Earlier it had said six died. It did not explain the change.   St. Helier Hospital reported two deaths there, and MaydayHospital's emergency chief, Kambiz Hashemi, said three people weredead at that hospital.   Reports of deaths reached 12 earlier in the day when Hashemireported four dead at Mayday and six more dead at the scene of thecrash _ a claim that could not later be confirmed. There also wasapparent confusion over the number of times the two deaths at St.Helier had been counted.   Hashemi said his hospital admitted 52 casualties, 20 of them inserious or critical condition. Twenty-four were discharged and threetransferred to hospitals specializing in head and spinal injuries.   Firefighters had to cut dozens of passengers from the wreckage ofthe trains, and authorities said some were trapped for hours afterthe 1:39 p.m. collision near the Purley station in Surrey.   Both trains originated in southeast England cities and weretraveling north to London.   A British Rail spokesman said it appeared a train that originatedin Horsham, West Sussex, was crossing from the local line to a maintrack when it ran into the back of a train that originated inLittlehampton.   Littlehampton is about 50 miles south of London and Horsham isabout 30 miles south of the city.   The spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it wasnot known why both trains were on the northbound track at the sametime.   The trains collided a few hundred yards outside the station onLondon's southern outskirts, sending several cars hurtling down anembankment into the yards of homes, witnesses said. It was not knownif anyone was hurt in the houses.   Several rail cars came to a precarious rest on the steep slope,and residents were advised to leave their homes until the wreckagecould be cleared.   Witnesses heard a deafening bang followed by silence, then shoutsand screams as passersby and residents rushed to the rescue.Firefighters arrived and cut victims from the wreckage.   British Rail estimated fewer than 100 people were in the trains _the normal low volume for a Saturday.   A three-train crash at London's busy Clapham Junction on Dec. 12killed 35 people, and the latest disaster brought immediateaccusations by the opposition Labor Party that neglect of thestate-owned rail system was to blame.   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was ``very distressed'' andfollowing developments, her office said. Queen Elizabeth II was saidto be shocked.   ``I heard a loud bang,'' said Alan Long, a nearby resident. ``Myson and I brought a sledgehammer and ran over to the train. Therewas blood everywhere and people screaming.''   Passenger Derek Pearson said his car ``was tipping down anembankment. I was trapped where I landed and showered with glass.''   He said his train, traveling from English Channel town ofLittlehampton, was going about 60 mph.   Tania Lawrence and her father were in the other train fromHorsham England, watching a couple across the aisle from them.   ``She flew through the air and was knocked unconscious and he wasthrown into my lap with blood pouring out of his head. He had glassin his eyes,'' said Ms. Lawrence.   British Rail said engineers began a probe into the cause.   Samantha Muggeridge, who was waiting on the Purley platform, saida slow train was headed for the station when ``a faster one came upbehind it and seemed to clip the back of it.''   The Dec. 12 crash in Clapham, 10 miles north of Purley, has beenblamed by British Rail on flaws in its system of installing newsignaling equipment.   Railroad officials believe malfunctioning signals led onecommuter train to slam into the rear of another stopped on thetracks. An empty freight train on an adjacent line then plowed intospillover wreckage and apparently hit some passengers who hadscrambled onto the tracks.   The Clapham crash was the worst rail wreck in Britain since 1975,when 43 people died in a subway train that crashed in a Londontunnel.</TEXT></DOC>
