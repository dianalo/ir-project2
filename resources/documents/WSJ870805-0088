Maturing bills outstanding total $13.49 billion, so the federal debt will be reduced about $300 million.    The offering will be divided evenly between 13-week and 26-week bills, which will be dated Aug. 13 and will mature Nov. 12 and Feb. 11, respectively.    Tenders for the bills, available in minimum denominations of $10,000, must be received by 1 p.m. EDT Monday at the Treasury or at Federal Reserve banks or branches.    The Treasury said it will postpone the offering if Congress hasn't raised the federal debt limit by Monday. </TEXT></DOC>
