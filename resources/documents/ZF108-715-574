 Although the technologies involved have beenpioneered by large multinationals like Sony and Microsoft, the industry hasnow matured to the point where entrepreneurs with modest capital can makeexcellent profits.andM;Optical Data Systems Inc. was founded in 1988 to provide optical disc storageproducts and services to the Canadian market.andM;Its Edmonton and Calgary offices are equipped with portable PC-basedconversion systems that will transfer information from paper, microforms, ormagnetic media to WORM (Write Once Read Many times) optical discs.andM;ODS now has more than 50 customers, and its main source of revenue has becomethe transfer of data from magnetic tape to optical discs for the petroleumindustry.andM;CEO and founder Ward Chandler projects continual growth for ODS, simplybecause of the tremendous savings companies can achieve with optical storagemedia.andM;Small storage spaceandM;&quot;Any business that is involved with any sort of records management orinformation storage is very excited about optical technology and the benefitsit can provide,&quot; he explains.andM;&quot;One of our 12-inch laser-discs can contain between 80 and 100 magnetictapes.andP;  These discs don't take much storage space, and are an extremelyrobust medium.andM;&quot;Very few companies care for magnetic tapes properly,&quot; says chandler.andP;  &quot;Butwhenever they do rewind and copy them, we can transfer their data from tapeto optical disc.andM;&quot;That's why seismic companies have been a natural market for us: it makes themost economic sense of just about anything you can imagine.andM;&quot;Seismic records must be duplicated anyway, and we can convert the data to asuperior medium at no extra cost,&quot; Chandler points out.andM;The &quot;superior&quot; qualities of optical discs have been widely publicized.andP;  Aswell as tremendous storage capacity (an autochanger can contain about 50discs -- the equivalent of a 700-foot-high stack of printouts), the discs areenvironmentally insensitive have a predicted error rate 1/10,000 that oftape.andM;This means that data-centre managers will spend virtually no time shelving,cataloging, and maintaining records on optical disc.andM;Service bureau approachandM;&quot;Although we supply optical readers and we're a value-added remarketer forSony,&quot; observes Chandler, &quot;most companies find it more economical to use usas a service bureau.andM;&quot;That way, they completely eliminate capital equipment-acquisition costs.&quot;andM;And, because the maintenance and storage expenses are virtually eliminatedtoo, ODS's customers also save on the personnel and physical-plant costsassociated with data archives.andM;Users of the data are pleased, too.andP;  The discs can be accessed randomly justlike a hard-disc drive.andM;On any given disc, any single file can be located in 0.2 seconds - andtechnology enhancements will reduce access time significantly in the next fewyears.andM;Chandler is convinced that optical data-storage is a long-term growthindustry: &quot;The trade will never die: it's similar to microfilming, wherethousands of service bureaus use commonly-available equipment to performregular services for an established client base.&quot;andM;If the record of Optical Data Systems is any indication, service companieslike it have a bright future indeed.andM;The company went public in January of this year, and is expanding to workwith government departments and legal and engineering firms.andM;CD Pubco Inc., also based in Calgary and Edmonton, is a young company, too:it was incorporated in November of 1987.andM;However, it addresses an entirely different segment of the opticaldata-storage industry.andM;CD Pubco transfers large data bases -- anything over 1.5 GB -- to read onlycompact discs and sells them to the public.andM;Although they offer a variety of third-party CD databases and different typesof CD-ROM equipment, the company's true product is called GeoBase: a turnkeysystem that contains a set of oil-well records and proprietary retrievalsoftware.andM;&quot;Anyone can put data on compact disc,&quot; comments Andrew Zolnai, an accountexecutive at CD Pubco.andP;  &quot;But we've put together a very special retrievalengine, and it's become our main business.andM;&quot;We began a year ago with a single CD that contained general oilwellinformation for Alberta,&quot; Zolnai explains.andP;  &quot;Now we sell a disc for each ofthe three western provinces.andM;The information that CD Pubco sells to energy companies is all public domain,but the value that the small company puts into the data through their storageand retrieval systems has won them about 55 regular clients in less than ayear.andM;&quot;Our typical customer is a small-or medium-sized energy company without amainframe budget.andP;  They can't afford to pay much, and they have to meet somepretty aggressive deadlines.andM;&quot;We'll lease a customer the well-file data, the software, and the CD readeras a turnkey system beginning at about $600 a month.andP;  Our customers hook itup to their PCs.&quot;andM;The idea of a turnkey system has been crucial to CD Pubco's success.andP;  Zolnaisays that the fact that data is on a CD is &quot;absolutely transparent to theuser because the retrieval system's user-interface is so good.&quot;andM;Although the data relationships that CD Pubco's customers look for arecomplex, the retrieval engine interfaces through a pull-down menu system thatZolnai describes as &quot;intuitive and easy to use.&quot;andM;&quot;These huge databases - about 1.8 GB for Alberta, for example -- can behandled efficiently by a PC because of the sophisticated access system ourprogrammers have developed,&quot; he explains.andM;&quot;The CD contains the keys for searches, and the user's PC only has to search:it doesn't have to process or sort.&quot;andM;Wave of growthandM;With GeoBase, information on wells from 1891 and pools from 1962 can beretrieved by location, field or pool, or drill date.andP;  The CD for oil-richAlberta contains general information on nearly 160,000 wells and productiondata for about 80,000 sites.andM;Geologists use the database and its sophisticated retrieval system togenerate custom maps that would not have been possible -- at least for asmall company on a limited budget -- a few years ago.andM;Both CD Pubco and Optical Data Systems are riding a growing wave of interestin optical data-storage.andM;Some industry projections call for a five-year 30 per cent compound annualgrowth for the information and image a management industry.andP;  One source putsthe North American market at $12 billion by 1993.andM;&quot;We don't have to look far for new customers: just about anyone will talk tous.&quot; says ODS's chandler.andP;  &quot;Our biggest challenge is to separate the 'Wow,isn't this neat' people from the 'I can use this now' people.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
