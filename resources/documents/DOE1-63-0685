Since 1980,exploitation feasibility surveys by drilling large bore survey wellsand others had been conducted in the Uenotai Area which had been chozenas the first priority location for exploitation. Furthermore, in theend of 1984, the target scale of the exploitation at the above area wasdetermined to be 25,000KW and a demonstration survey started. This articleexplains an outline of the geothermal resources surveys in and aroundthe Uenotai Area and introduces an example of a high temperature andvapour predominent field. As a result of the geological survey and physicalexploration of the Oyasu-Doroyu Region which has the bed of the pre-Tertiaryformations, drilling of small bore survey wells was done in the morepromising areas, and the exploitation of the Uenotai Area outside theKurikoma Nationally Designated Park got a priority over the Oyasu-OhyuZone in the above park. Following that, an exploitation feasibility surveyin the area was done and twelve large bore survey wells were drilled.Superheated steam jetted out of two of these wells and it was almostconfirmed that the steam production of the aforementioned scale be possible.(19 figs, 5 tabs, 12 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
