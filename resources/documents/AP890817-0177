The CDC study of 284 killings, assaults and other family violencein 1984 in Atlanta ``shows there is a good chance you can identifyboth the victims and perpetrators of family violence before someonecomes in dead,'' said Dr. Linda Saltzman, an epidemiologist whodesigned it. ``We have to work at protecting these people beforeviolence escalates to life-threatening proportions.''   The $100,000 study found that one in five murder victims wasmarried, living with or otherwise related to the killer; one in fourwho killed a lover or relative was known by police, social workersor public health to have had a history of assaulting family members;and more than 60 percent of the victims and perpetrators had been incontact with at least two public agencies.   Other research has shown that family violence is common and thosewho commit violent crimes often have police records; the CDC studysuggests that both victims and perpetrators routinely have contactwith public agencies.   ``We're looking at why we're not always sharing information andseeing what we can do,'' said Dr. Ardith Peters of the AtlantaDepartment of Public Safety.   However, even if police know who is most prone to violence, theycan't prevent crimes in all cases, she said. ``The richest city inthe world can't afford to be social workers at large to the world sothe question becomes, `How do you most effectively deploy theresources you have?'''</TEXT><HEAD>Crater Lake Study Yields Many Surprises</HEAD><DATELINE>CRATER LAKE NATIONAL PARK, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A search of Crater Lakehas turned up more than the hot springs scientists were seeking.   In recent weeks the researchers have found mysterious, aqua-bluepools of dense fluid, black mud ``of unknown origin'' and a new kindof mite. Last year, and again this summer, they found white andorange bacterial mats.   A sample of the black mud and samples of the bacteria and theblue water that apparently feeds the bacteria were returned Tuesdayfrom the lake's 1,550-foot-deep south basin, said Jim Milestone, thepark biologist. The mud ``looks like oil,'' he said. ``It'sdefinitely a mud, with fine grains in it.''   The first of three blue pools of fluid were found the weekbefore. ``I've never seen anything like it,'' said Oregon StateUniversity oceanographer Jack Dymond, who heads the project with OSUoceanographer Robert Collier.   The first pool was about 6 feet deep by 3 feet by 8 feet.``Precipitates surrounded the pool with yellow deposits,'' Milestonesaid. ``We don't know at this time if these are precipitates or anew type of bacteria.'' The two pools found since using the specialDeep Rover submarine are 14 to 16 feet long.   The new mite, dubbed the Crater Lake mite, was found on rocksamples taken from the bottom of the lake. Milestone said it's aspecies that eats algae, indicating that algae live in the lake upto 450 feet deep.   Dymond and Collier believe the 2,000-foot-deep lake in thecaldera of the 7,000-year-old Mount Mazama volcano was formed by ageothermal spring. It is on a National Park Service list of parkswith ``significant thermal features'' and the agency must report toCongress next year if it should stay on the list.   If hot springs are found, the government could limit geothermaldrilling and development outside the park. The scientists say aminimum difference of 10 degrees Celsius is necessary to qualify thelake as a hydrothermal spring.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Aug. 21</NOTE></DOC>
