The principles, which grew out ofa meeting between Mr. Baker and President Bush, represent themost comprehensive declaration of American policy toward theSoviet Union and its republics since the collapse of lastmonth's coup in Moscow.</LP><TEXT>   At the same time, Mr. Baker said at a news conference thatthe U.S. would need some time to consider Israel's requestfor a $10 billion U.S. loan guarantee, and he implied thatthe U.S. decision will be influenced by the pace of progresstoward peace in the Middle East. His remarks are likely toanger Israel and its U.S. supporters, who believe that theloan guarantee, which is being sought to help settle Jewsemigrating from the Soviet Union, shouldn't be linked toother issues.   The principles governing U.S. policy toward the SovietUnion lay the groundwork for a trip Mr. Baker announced hewill make next week to that country and to the breakawayBaltic republics, whose independence President Bushofficially recognized this week.   Mr. Baker said that the U.S. won't try to determine whatshape the Soviet Union will take. But he declared that theU.S. believes the &quot;future of the Soviet Union is for theSoviet peoples to determine themselves, peacefully andconsistent with democratic values and practices.&quot;   Second, he called on all in the Soviet Union to &quot;respectexisting borders, internal and external&quot; and to press forchanges in borders only through peaceful means. Third, hesaid other political changes should be made only through&quot;orderly, democratic processes, especially elections.&quot;Fourth, he called for safeguarding human rights. And finally,he called for &quot;respect for international law andobligations.&quot;   The principles reflect growing concern within the Bushadministration that the current process by which Sovietrepublics are breaking away from central control could bemessy and dangerous. Administration officials worry, forinstance, about the possibility of violent showdowns betweenSoviet republics over borders and about disputes over thetreatment of Russian minorities in ethnic republics.   In addition, there are worries that the rise of Russianand ethnic nationalism could lead to heightenedanti-Semitism. And the administration wants to be sure thatenough central authority is preserved in Moscow to enforcearms-control treaties and other international agreements theSoviets have made.   Mr. Baker also made clear that the administration plans totake advantage of the failed Soviet coup to press harder forfundamental changes in the economies of the Soviet Union andits individual republics. He said he would push for suchchanges next week in his visit. &quot;The Soviet politicalrevolution must now be matched by an economic revolution,&quot; hesaid.   In his remarks yesterday on the loan guarantee for Israel,Mr. Baker insisted that the administration &quot;remains fullycommitted&quot; to helping Israel absorb the one million SovietJews it expects over the next five years. But he added, &quot;Wewant a little bit of time to review this request . . . whatthe impact might or might not be vis-a-vis the peaceprocess.&quot;   The loan guarantee request poses a dilemma for theadministration, which considers Israel's continued buildingof settlements in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip amajor obstacle in the peace process. If the administrationattempts to set conditions for the guarantees, hard-liners inIsrael could scuttle efforts to hold a Mideast peaceconference in October. On the other hand, Arab states willprotest if the U.S. fails to rein in the Israelis on thesettlements issue.   Reacting to Mr. Baker's remarks, Malcolm Hoenlein,executive director of the Conference of Presidents of MajorAmerican Jewish Organizations, said, &quot;Whatever time they needto consider the loan guarantee should be brief. The need isan immediate one.&quot; Israel is expected to formally request theguarantees, which will enable it to borrow money more easilyand at more favorable rates, on Friday. Mr. Baker may includea swing through the Middle East during his travels next week.</TEXT></DOC>
