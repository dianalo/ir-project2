To protect the public from fraudulent claims, the FDA is banningnonprescription anti-baldness creams and lotions and aphrodisiacproducts.   Though over-the-counter hair-growth products have dwindled innumber since the FDA indicated in 1985 that it wanted to remove theproducts from the market, ``they have continued to be an area ofconsiderable fraud.   ``The ban of all such products will provide a greater and moreuniform protection to the public,'' the FDA said.   Few of these types of products are on the market, and thoseavailable usually are sold by mail or through barbers or beauticians.   ``The industry has been anticipating this for a long time,'' JohnT. Walden, a spokesman for the Nonprescription Drug ManufacturersAssociation, said Friday after the FDA announced plans to ban thetwo products.   The number of companies marketing nonprescription aphrodisiacsalso has shrunk in anticipation of a ban. No manufacturer defendedits product during the agency's review.   The bans will become effective in six months.   For anti-baldness products, the ban applies to those availablewithout a prescription that are used externally.   The only product approved by the FDA for stimulating hair growthon the crown of the head is a prescription drug that is a 2 percentsolution of minoxidil, which is applied to the scalp. The drug ismanufactured by The Upjohn Co. and sold under the name Rogaine.   The FDA also said it will ban on a case-by-case basis vitamins,food supplements or other products taken orally that claim to growhair or retard baldness, because no evidence exists proving theywork.   An FDA advisory panel recommended the ban after it evaluated anumber of ingredients in anti-baldness medicines, including lanolin,olive oil, wheat germ oil and vitamins. The panel found none ofthese prevented baldness or promoted hair growth.   The FDA said that once the ban is in effect, manufacturers of anynonprescription remedy claiming to prevent baldness or grow hairwill have to provide proof that it is safe and effective before itcan be sold.   Ingredients commonly found in products billed as aphrodisiacsinclude cantharides, a chemical derived from the dried bodies ofbeetles, estrogens, strychnine, yohimbine, fennel, mandrake, anise,licorice and zinc, the FDA said.   Some of these are contained in food products, but none of thosewould be covered by the ban unless specifically labeled as anaphrodisiac.   The FDA advised people with sexual problems to seek treatment bya medical professional and not try to medicate themselves. Male sexhormones affect sexual drive and performance, but because they arepowerful hormones with potentially serious side effects, supplementsof such hormones should be used only under a doctor's care, theagency added.   The FDA review of both types of products is part of an ongoingevaluation of over-the-counter medicines that began in the early1970s to ensure the safety and effectiveness of all of theiringredients.   The American Pharmaceutical Association's Handbook ofNonprescription Drugs lists no aphrodisiac or anti-baldness products.   Walden said none of his association's members, who represent 95percent of the FDA-regulated nonprescription drugs on the market,markets either type of product.</TEXT></DOC>
