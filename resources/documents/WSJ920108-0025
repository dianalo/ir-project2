Crude oil for February delivery fell by 52 cents a barrelto $18.69. Gasoline and heating oil prices declined as well.</LP><TEXT>   Also lending a bearish tone to the market was a reportreleased yesterday by the American Petroleum Institute afterthe market closed, showing that inventories for crude andpetroleum products climbed last week.   Distillate, or heating oil stocks, unexpectedly rose by481,000 barrels to 143.4 million barrels. The increasebuttresses the belief that winter demand won't be sufficientto sop up the large supplies of home heating fuel. Gasolineinventories rose by more than five million barrels whilecrude stocks increased more than three million.   Iraqi and U.N. officials are expected to meet today andtomorrow in Vienna to discuss terms of restrictions on thecrude oil sale. Iraq thus far has rejected the U.N. plan,considering too onerous the terms that bar its government'saccess to the proceeds of the sale.   But traders began to sell oil contracts when rumorscirculated that the U.N.'s terms might be relaxed in aneffort to get Iraq's acceptance. The plan aims to providefood and medical assistance to Iraq's people, who have beensuffering as a result of sanctions imposed during the PersianGulf crisis. There was also speculation that the White Housemight support an easing of terms. But late in the day, aWhite House official denied that there was any change in theU.S. stance.   Because the sell-off was so sudden and sharp, there issome speculation that prices could recover somewhat today.Some traders, figuring the eventual acceptance of a plan byIraq was already factored into the market, didn't anticipatesuch a quick decline.   Crude oil prices had been trading higher through much ofyesterday's trading session based on news that two oil fieldsin the North Sea had been shut down because of damage tosafety equipment. But pricing action today will likely dependupon how market participants digest bearish API statisticsand any news coming out of the U.N.-Iraq meeting in Vienna.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          COTTON: Prices rallied on speculation that theAgricultural Department's crop production report, to bereleased Friday, will further lower the estimate for the 1991Texas crop. The March contract ended at 60.43 cents a pound,up 0.33 cent. Bernard Savaiko, senior futures analyst atPaineWebber in New York, noted there was some buying bycotton-trade companies, possibly against foreign businessthey may have recently booked. He said the pummeling thedollar has been taking over the past couple of weeks has madeU.S. cotton look attractive to many overseas buyers. Monday'sclose above 60 cents set a constructive tone for Tuesday'sprice action; that tone was reinforced Tuesday when the Marchcontract opened at 60.02 and didn't drop below the 60 centlevel. Mr. Savaiko said he sees resistance at the 62-centlevel and support for the contract at 58 cents. &quot;A lot ofnegatives about cotton are discounted by the current price,but any sign of further weakening in retail sales could knockprices down some more,&quot; he said.                                                                                                          LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: Strong prices on the cash market sentcattle futures prices surging higher. Prices were firm tohigher at the Texas-Oklahoma and western Kansas terminalmarkets. This, coupled with trade expectations of betterwholesale demand for beef next month, pushed the price of theFebruary live cattle contract up 1.47 cents, just shy of the1.5-cent daily limit, to 73.75 cents a pound. The contractgot additional support from a winter storm brewing in thePlains states, which would temporarily inhibit cattle growthif it is severe.                                                                                                          ORANGE JUICE: Prices continued declining as freezingweather appears unlikely for the next week or so. The Marchcontract opened at $1.5325 a pound, compared with Monday'sclose of $1.5435. The contract ended at $1.5160, only 0.60cent off the day's low. Bernard Savaiko of PaineWebber saidthe market's next area of support is at $1.50. He noted thatso far retailers have chosen not to pass along the higherwholesale prices that resulted from the AgriculturalDepartment's bullish October crop report. &quot;If they do try topass along even the current prices, which are already 25cents below the peak set just after the report came out, Iwould expect considerable consumer resistance to them,&quot; Mr.Savaiko said. &quot;I would then look for another 10 cent or 15cent sell-off.&quot; Michael Palmerino, a meteorologist at WeatherServices Corp. in Bedford, Mass., said he sees no sign ofextreme cold reaching Florida in the next week even though heexpects colder air in the Midwest and Northeast. Though mosttraders consider Jan. 15 to be the end of the major freezeseason in Florida, Mr. Palmerino said that assumption isn'tvalid. &quot;In both January 1985 and January 1986 there wereFlorida freezes that affected the citrus crop, and in bothcases the freezes began after the 20th of the month,&quot; hesaid. &quot;Florida weather-watchers should also keep in mind thatthe worst freeze on record occurred in the first 10 days ofFebruary, in 1899, when the temperatures dropped below zeroin Tallahassee.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
