The rebels contend Sunday's election will be fraudulent andunrepresentative, and they believe their boycott will help prove it.   Their theory holds that talks will begin when all other solutionsare seen to fail; that if death squads, elections and U.S. aidcannot pacify the nation, perhaps all sides will see negotiations asthe only alternative.   ``Reality imposes itself on everybody's dreams, including ourown,'' said Ana Guadalupe Martinez, another member of the politicalcommission who spoke with The Associated Press.   Rebel leaders offered to participate if the election was delayedsix months and a fair vote was guaranteed. When their proposalfailed, they called for a boycott, threatened election workers andstopped traffic throughout the country with threats to attackvehicles and drivers.   They also launched several attacks, including one with rocketgrenades on the presidential palace that wounded seven people.   Despite their boycott, the rebels have said supporting theleftist Democratic Convergence is a valid option for Salvadorans.The party is running third in polls to the right-wing RepublicanNationalist Alliance, known as Arena, and the incumbent ChristianDemocrats.   Ms. Martinez said guerrilla leaders knew the boycott would affectthe leftist party's showing but they feel the total vote against thestatus quo includes those who do not vote or cast ballots that areblank or defaced.   Guillermo Ungo, the Convergence presidential candidate, has askedthe guerrillas to call off the boycott, comparing the rebel allianceto a woman ``who wants to jump into bed but still remain a virgin.''   ``That sounds like Dr. Ungo, all right,'' Ms. Martinez said,laughing.   ``The Convergence wasn't going to win anyway,'' she added, ``butthey need to play a respectable political role.''   She and Lopez admitted the rebels risk being seen as the culpritseven if they succeed in discrediting the election, but Ms. Martinezsaid: ``This war didn't start with these elections. It has deepercauses'' and the guerrillas have made ``responsible gestures towardsnegotiations.''   Arena leads in the polls but a runoff is possible. If one isneeded, it would be held in April, and the two officials said theoffer of negotiations might be renewed before that.   ``We'll have to evaluate the election results, and whether ourstrategy worked,'' Lopez said.   Ms. Martinez said the guerrillas hope their strategy will workeven if the winner is Alfredo Cristiani, the Arena candidate, butadded: ``Cristiani has a moderate image but that may not haveanything to do with the interests he represents.''   She said she fears Roberto d'Aubuisson, a former army officer whowho founded Arena. D'Aubuisson has been linked to death squads butdenies the allegations.   ``D'Aubuisson may be the power behind the throne,'' Ms. Martinezsaid, but nine years of war and 70,000 deaths are factors in favorof negotiations.   ``They tried death squads and they couldn't pacify the country,''she said. ``How can they try that again?''</TEXT></DOC>
