The water-gasshift reaction, syngas as a source of hydrogen, formation of chemicalsin high yield directly from syngas, chemicals from methanol plus eithersyngas, carbon monoxide or other compounds, conversion of methanol tochemicals using shape-selective catalysts, and some chemicals from thedirect reaction of syngas or carbon monoxide with a third component.99 refs., 2 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
