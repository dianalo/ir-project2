A clever illustration blendssense with nonsense, and my girls delight in finding theartist's &quot;mistakes.&quot; I like watching them take their firststeps in learning that life is not always as it appears.   They'll need to know that in a culture that celebratespolls, such as the recent one purporting to show that faithin God is the most important thing to Americans.</LP><TEXT>   As reported by the Associated Press this spring, a cabletelevision show commissioned Princeton Survey ResearchAssociates to conduct a telephone survey of 600 adults. Thepoll asked respondents to comparatively rank the importanceof various concerns, with the following results: 40% saidfaith in God was the most important thing in their lives; 29%said good health was number one; a happy marriage was thechoice of 21%. Only 5% said that an enjoyable job was mostimportant, and 2% a job that pays well. Curiously, respect ofpeople in the community mattered to only 2%. And 1% said thatnone of these six issues was most important. (Maybe nothingmatters to them])   As presented, these results paint a rosy picture. Faith inGod is most important] I guess that means architects andcontractors will soon be hiring for the anticipated buildingboom in churches. Seminaries will need to expand, too. Andindustry can expect a &quot;moral dividend&quot; as workers' faithtranslates into ethical integrity on the job, lowering costsand boosting productivity.   Good health is the next most important] Time to sell yourtobacco, alcohol and junk food stocks. Look forward to ahefty decrease in health insurance premiums.   A happy marriage is third most important] Wow, that'sencouraging, unless you're a divorce lawyer. It means fewertax dollars will be needed for welfare: Happy marriages tendto be self-supporting. I'm sure police will be glad to knowthey won't be handling so many domestic disputes anymore.   So What's Wrong With This Picture? Well, if faith in Godis supposedly &quot;the most important thing&quot; to us Americans, aquick check of our checkbooks should bear this out. Yet in a1988 survey for Independent Sector, Gallup Internationalfound that people who make between $50,000 and $75,000 a yeargive only an average 1.5% of their incomes to charity,religious or otherwise. Another study, by an organizationcalled &quot;empty tomb, inc.,&quot; looked at giving to churchesbetween 1968 and 1985, under a grant from the LillyFoundation. While disposable income increased 103% duringthat period, average per-capita contributions to churchesrose only 2%. Meanwhile, the leisure industry soaks up 12% ofthe average American's income. Is religion really the mostimportant?   If so, our schedules should show it. Last November,American Demographics reported that Americans now have morefree time than in 1965 -- about 40 hours a week. Naturally,TV viewing gets the biggest share of that, about 15 hours.Visiting friends and talking take up three or four hours.Religion? An hour a week for women, even less for men. (Butwho knows, maybe those 15 hours of TV are devoted totelevangelists.)   So, religion is the most important, even though we don'tspend much time or money on it.   Well, if it is, then surely it should make a profounddifference in the area we supposedly care so little about --our jobs. Is that the case? The Princeton Religion ResearchCenter, affiliated with Gallup International, has measuredthe impact of religion on day-to-day work. Comparing the&quot;churched&quot; with the &quot;unchurched&quot; on a wide range of behaviorslike pilfering supplies (stealing), overstatingqualifications on resumes (lying), calling in sick when notsick (lying and stealing), and overstating tax deductions(lying, stealing and cheating), PRRC finds &quot;little differencein the ethical views and behavior of the churched and theunchurched.&quot; What differences there are &quot;are not significantor are of marginal significance.&quot;   Now I ask: If faith in God makes no difference in how wespend our money; if it makes no difference in how we spendour time; if it makes no difference in our ethical behavioron the job -- then how &quot;important&quot; can it really be?   I have to admit, though, that if a pollster had called mewith the seven choices listed, I'd have responded with the40%. (Actually, I don't care for the question. It forces anunnatural and unnecessary competition between various areasof life: God vs. family vs. work vs. health, etc.)   So does that mean that faith in God is the most importantthing in my life? I'd like to think so, but I'm not so sure.Sometimes when I look in the mirror I have to ask: What'sWrong With This Picture?   ---   Mr. Hendricks, a Dallas-based communications consultant,is the co-author, with Doug Sherman, of &quot;Your Work Matters toGod&quot; (Navpress, 1987).</TEXT></DOC>
