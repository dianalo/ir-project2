Shevardnadze arrived on a special Aeroflot plane that landed atBeijing's old airport, now used only by top Chinese and foreignleaders. He was met by his Chinese counterpart, Qian Qichen. The twoshook hands warmly as they stood bareheaded in a biting wind.   Shevardnadze told reporters before stepping into his limousine hewas carrying a letter from Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev toChinese leaders. He did not reveal the contents.   ``I reached an agreement in principle with my comrade Qian Qichenin Moscow'' on holding a summit, he said. ``Now we're going to talkconcretely about the matter.'' Qian visited Moscow in December.   In his written statement, Shevardnadze called Qian's visit a``major step forward'' and added, ``We have stepped on the soil ofthe People's Republic of China full of good expectations and greathopes.''   Shevardnadze will meet with Qian on Thursday morning. He flies toShanghai on Friday and meets the following day with Deng, who is inthe east coast city for the upcoming Lunar New Year.   Shevardnadze told the Soviet news agency Tass on Tuesday he wasready to conclude the agenda for a summit this year betweenGorbachev and Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping. He said he was bringingconcrete suggestions for a date.   Both sides have indicated they want such a meeting in the firsthalf of the year. The Soviets have been courting China for severalyears in an effort to heal their ideological and political quarrel,but only in the past year has China shown equal eagerness.   Factors include changes in Soviet policy and a sense that notmuch time remains for Deng, who is 84.   Vietnam's 10-year occupation of Cambodia has been one of the mainissues dividing China and the Soviet Union.   However, under apparent pressure from its main ally, the SovietUnion, Vietnam said in December it was willing to pull out bySeptember, and China agreed in principle to end its aid to Cambodianrebels by then.   The two other issues that have stood in the way of aChinese-Soviet reconciliation also appear nearing resolution. TheSoviet Union is scheduled to complete its troop pullout fromAfghanistan in two weeks and has announced plans to pull some troopsout of Mongolia, its ally on the Chinese border.   The last Soviet foreign minister to visit Beijing was AndreiGromyko, who accompanied Nikita Khrushchev in 1959. The next yearthe two countries split bitterly over leadership of the worldcommunist movement and a border dispute.</TEXT></DOC>
