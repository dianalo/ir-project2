Reagan gave the sentimental goodbye during his seventh and lastWhite House Correspondents Association dinner appearance, afterjoking about the recent spate of books from former aides, thepresidential campaign and the treatment he's gotten from the presscorps.   Looking over the crowd of Washington elected officials, Cabinetmembers and celebrity guests from Hollywood, he said, ``It lookslike the index of Larry Speakes' book.''   He noted that Speakes had criticized his mental powers, whenSpeakes said in his recently published book that preparing Reaganfor a press conference was like ``reinventing the wheel.''   ``I was around when the wheel was invented,'' Reagan said.   ``Even (White House chief of staff) Howard Baker is writing abook. It's going to be called `Three By Five: the Measure of aPresident,''' he said, in a reference to his use of index cards inmeetings.   And joking about the frequent complaints that he does not holdenough meetings with the press, he said the presidential campaignhas left him ``feeling a little lonely.''   ``I've been so desperate for attention, I almost consideredholding a news conference,'' Reagan said.   After the jokes, Reagan gave a warmhearted toast, applauded bythe press corps and guests, ``to this God-blessed land.''   He said presidents and the press could agree and work together``to keep this great miracle alive because the world is a betterplace because of us. To the United States of America,'' he said,raising his glass.   ``Every president seeks to use the press,'' Reagan said. ``Thepress can take care of itself and hopefully so can a president. Ihope that my epitaph will be with relations with the White Housepress corps, `He gave as good as he got.'''   Several journalism awards were handed out at the annual dinner.   Gerald F.
