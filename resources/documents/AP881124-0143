As a tropical storm, Keith crossed Florida's midsection lateTuesday and Wednesday with winds of 65 mph and slashing rains. LowerAtlantic temperatures chilled it down to 45 mph sustained winds byThursday afternoon, although there were gusts of 64 mph.   ``It's now extratropical. It's expected to merge with a bigwintertime storm to the northeast and we will lose track of itsidentity,'' said forecaster Bob Case at the National HurricaneCenter.   At 5 p.m. EST Thursday, the center of Keith's remnants was nearlatitude 35.0 north and longitude 64.0 west, or about 200 milesnorth-northeast of Bermuda, and it was moving north-northeast at 40mph.   No major problems were reported on Bermuda after gale-force windsand rains swept across with Keith.   In Florida, it left large sections of shoreline eroded in theSarasota and St. Petersburg Beach areas and on the island of Captiva.   At its worst, the storm was blamed for heavy winds and rain thatflipped over a truck near Tampa Bay area. Tornadoes spawned by thestorm damaged some 25 mobile homes in Lake County, in the state'smidsection, and in Tampa, and flooding was reported in low-lyingareas in the storm's path.   The storm also was blamed for the derailment of 34 cars of acargo train Wednesday near Lakeland because of a railroad bed washedout by rain.</TEXT></DOC>
