(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Ethics, not increased security, are the bestdefense against computer ``worms'' like the one unleashed last fallby a Cornell University graduate student, a school official said.   A special university commission reported Monday that Robert T.Morris Jr. acted alone and with ``reckless disregard'' on Nov. 2when he launched a debilitating program into the Internet network,causing thousands of computers around the country to clog andoverload.   The commission concluded that Morris did not intend for the wormto destroy data or files, but that he did want it to spread widely.   It said the program was not technically a ``virus'' _ a programthat inserts itself into a host program to propagate _ but was a``worm,'' an independent program that replicates itself once placedin a computer system.   Release of the worm was not a ``heroic event that pointed up theweaknesses of operating systems,'' contrary to Morris' claim, thecommission wrote. The panel also denied that Morris was a geniusfor creating the worm. It said although the worm was technicallysophisticated, it could have been created by many students.   In fact, Morris' ``juvenile act'' did little to provide insightsinto the already well-known security flaws of the Internet system,a national research network used by universities, industry andgovernment, said M. Stuart Lynn, Cornell's vice president oftechnologies.   Lynn and Cornell Provost Robert Barker said the incident'sgreatest impact was the breach of trust it had caused amongresearchers who use the network. However, both cautioned thatemploying drastic security steps was not a solution to preventsimilar incidents.   ``Violations of such a trust cannot be condoned,'' said Lynn.``A community of scholars shouldn't have to build sky-high walls inorder to protect a reasonable expectation of privacy _ particularlywhen such walls would impede the free flow of information andideas.''   Lynn added that it's unlikely any security steps could guaranteean impenetrable system ``in a community of individuals possessed ofall the knowledge and skills required to scale the highestbarriers.''   Instead, the Cornell officials stressed the need for improvedawareness of computer ethics, said Lynn.   ``I don't think one can ever feel confident by putting biggerand tighter locks on the door,'' said Lynn. ``That's why it'simportant to stress ethical considerations.''   Morris, who is on a leave of absence from school, declined to beinterviewed by the commission, which was left to speculate as tothe reasons he created the ``worm.''   The panel made no recommendation about disciplinary actionagainst the first-year graduate student in Cornell's doctoralcomputer program. Barker said Morris' case would be reviewed by apanel of graduate students and faculty that could permanently barhim from the university.   Morris, 23, of Arnold, Md., remains under investigation by afederal grand jury in Syracuse and the Justice Department inWashington, D.C.</TEXT></DOC>
