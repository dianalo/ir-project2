Before the political upheaval, most Eastern European andSoviet Union airports were considered almost terrorist-proof,because the police there had such tight control overcitizens. But U.S. safety specialists say that with people inthe East bloc having new freedoms and traveling more, it maybe easier for hijackers and terrorists to target flights fromsuch cities as Moscow, Prague and Warsaw.   In fact, five hijackings have been reported on Sovietairliners in the past year, according to the Federal AviationAdministration. Because the Soviets didn't previously reporthijackings, FAA officials say they don't know if suchincidents are on the rise. &quot;But it's definitely a significantnumber,&quot; says Quinten T. Johnson, the FAA's manager of civilaviation security division.   The FAA is reviewing its requirements for U.S. carriersflying to and from Eastern Europe. U.S. airlines currentlydon't have to check baggage as carefully in Eastern Europe asin Western Europe and the Middle East. &quot;There's no questionthat as society controls decrease, opportunity increases,&quot;says Mr. Johnson. &quot;I guess it's the price of freedom.&quot;   Safety specialists maintain, however, that Eastern Europestill has a big safety advantage: Gun controls are tight,limiting hijackers' ability to arm themselves.                                                                                                          Airlines Take Closer Look   To Stop Bogus Refunds                                                                                                          FOR TRAVELERS trying to sneak out of nonrefundable airlinetickets, the jig may be up.   Airlines normally refund nonrefundable tickets only totravelers who are too sick to fly or who have a suddenillness or death in the family. So, some people unable to usetheir nonrefundable tickets have been feigning illness to geta doctor's note or persuading doctors to give them phonynotes.   Now, some airline officials say they're checking theseexcuses more carefully, by calling up doctors orinvestigating the notes other ways. One New York travel agentwas found with a doctor's note pad, forging the physician'sname, according to industry officials. Some carriers thataren't entirely satisfied with someone's excuse ask or forcethe traveler to take a voucher for future travel, instead ofa refund.   &quot;There have just been too many abuses,&quot; says a spokeswomanfor America West. &quot;It's a shame, because we still want tohelp people who really have a legitimate excuse.&quot;   Airlines have also gotten wise to another ploy: Manytravelers go to airports and tell sob stories to differentcounter agents until they find one willing to give a refund.Now, some airlines require counter agents to make notes ontheir computer system when travelers begin &quot;shopping around&quot;so that other agents won't be fooled.   But even airlines concede they can't catch everybody, anda few say they're not cracking down at all. Midway Airlines,for example, says it doesn't always require a doctor's note,although each case is handled individually. &quot;We have aphilosophy of being pretty lenient,&quot; concedes David Henry,customer-service director for the Chicago-based carrier.                                                                                                          Vacation of Vexation:   A Rental-Car Odyssey                                                                                                          HERE'S a car-rental horror story that's pretty hard tobeat.   Gabriel Crognale, a civil engineer from Newton, Mass.,wanted to spend seven days driving leisurely throughVenezuela last April. But when he arrived in Caracas, DollarRent a Car gave him a &quot;beaten up&quot; Chevette that was dented,had no radio and wouldn't go faster than 30 miles per hour.&quot;I had my foot on the floor,&quot; he recalls. &quot;People werelaughing.&quot;   Miffed, he returned the Dollar car the next day anddecided to rent from Hertz. But the first Hertz car he got,he says, &quot;died&quot; at a downtown garage, and he had to wait twohours for a replacement. Then he lost the keys on thereplacement and spent six hours in a parking garage, waitingfor Hertz to bring another car. &quot;They kept saying they'd bethere in a few minutes,&quot; he says.   Car No. 3 from Hertz wouldn't go faster than 40 mphwithout shaking madly, so Mr. Crognale returned it foranother one. By now, five days into his trip, his vacationwas pretty much ruined, he says.   But the worst was yet to come. On his way to the airporton the last day of his vacation, he stopped at a gas station,and the car wouldn't start again. Frantically, he grabbed ataxi -- but missed his flight and had to stay another day.For his troubles, Hertz gave him a free car for the night (itran the best of all five vehicles, he says). But the companystill charged him $110 for the week's rental.   Mr. Crognale has since fired off letters to Dollar andHertz. Dollar says it hasn't received it yet, but a Hertzspokeswoman says the company will withdraw the $110 chargeand give him a $200 gift certificate toward a future Hertzrental. &quot;He obviously had a very unfortunate experience, andit was our fault,&quot; the Hertz spokeswoman says.                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          MEN ON A long trip are more likely than women to miss home(33% vs. 22%) and friends and family (24% vs. 10%), accordingto survey by Marriott Corp.'s Residence Inn. . . . A new nameseems to make a difference to hotel guests. Occupancy ratesjumped 5% to 7% at hotels that the previous year had left onechain for another, gone independent or joined a chain for thefirst time, a Laventhol andamp; Horwath study shows.</TEXT></DOC>
