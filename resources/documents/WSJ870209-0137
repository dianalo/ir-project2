And they are willing to pay for it.    After three years of debate, the state legislature has created the California Task Force to Promote Self-Esteem and Personal and Social Responsibility. It is believed to be the first attempt by any state in the U.S. to bolster personal pride.    As much as $735,000 will be spent over three years to &quot;create an opportunity to let people feel good about themselves, nurture themselves, and become more positively mainstreamed into life,&quot; says Ruta Aldridge, an aide to John Vasconcellos, the assemblyman who suggested the panel.    California's special assistant attorney general, a Fresno psychologist and a former Los Angeles policeman are among the 13 members named to the panel so far; 12 more are yet to be selected. Interest in joining the task force is strong. &quot;Within my personal sphere of awareness, there have been at least 300 candidates,&quot; Ms. Aldridge says. &quot;John has been networking with a lot of care-giving people.&quot;    Mr. Vasconcellos has conceded that local editorials &quot;had a field day&quot; with the bill -- calling it &quot;pipe-dream nonsense,&quot; &quot;touchy-feely&quot; and &quot;a brilliant parody of California.&quot; But he thinks promoting self-esteem may help prevent drug abuse, violence and other social ills.    His press aide, Geoffrey Long, says the task-force budget about equals the cost of keeping 13 people in prison. He adds, &quot;If we can keep 13 yo-yos from breaking in and stealing Ding Dongs, the program pays for itself.&quot;    California has had unusual agencies before, but most were associated with &quot;Governor Moonbeam&quot; -- former Democratic Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., recently reported to be studying Zen Buddhism in Japan. Some of Gov. Brown's programs -- the Council on Wellness and Physical Fitness, for example, and the Solar-Cal Office -- were killed by the current governor, Republican George Deukmejian. Gov. Deukmejian vetoed a bill to study self-esteem, but supported the bill to promote it.    Task Force appointee Andrew Mecca, who heads a nonprofit Marin County-based health-research center, says he hopes the task force will be a &quot;real porthole to self-assessment&quot; and will &quot;come up with a strategic plan to enhance self-empowerment -- a sort of bill of rights for self-esteem.&quot; Mr. Mecca says, &quot;We're committed to making this relevant.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
