Mary Kay last week filed a lawsuit claiming that Avon andtwo private investigative agencies had illegally takendocuments from a dumpster used by a Mary Kay affiliate.</LP><TEXT>   Yesterday, the companies agreed to an injunction, ineffect declaring that everybody gets to be on hand if Avondecides to try to reassemble the shredded documents. And bothsides claimed a victory of sorts.   A spokesman for the Mary Kay affiliate, Richmont Corp.,said the agreement &quot;gives us the right to visit our garbageand take pictures of it. And if they attempt to reconstructany of the shredded documents, they have to tell us and giveus the right to be present.&quot;   An Avon spokesman declared, &quot;We have not done anythingeven slightly improper, much less illegal. Our privateinvestigators retrieved from a public dumpster documents thatMary Kay had thrown away and in some cases shredded. It wasimportant to find out if this was information we wereentitled to obtain. It was.&quot;   He added that Avon &quot;still has control&quot; of the materialretrieved from the trash. &quot;They've agreed we have the rightto use it. Now they want to sit and watch us reassemble it.&quot;   Indeed, Avon tipped off Mary Kay that it had been usingdumpster discovery when it advised a federal court in NewYork recently that it had turned up new information in aneffort to prove that a dissident shareholder group hadn'tbroken up, despite announcements to the contrary. The majorholder in the group, Chartwell Associates L.P., had beenhoping to gain control of Avon, but was stymied by Avon'spoison-pill anti-takeover provision that blocked Chartwellfrom acquiring more than 20% of its shares.   To get around that barrier, Chartwell split up with othermembers of its group including Richmont Corp., which managesan investment affiliate of Mary Kay that holds about 4% ofAvon's common. Chartwell last week sold 10 million Avonshares for $395 million, but still owns about a 3.5% votingstake valued at about $100 million.   The trash in dispute was found in a dumpster at an airportin Addison, Texas, where Richmont has offices. Avon said thedumpster was owned by the trash hauling firm and located in apublic parking lot. &quot;We told the {federal} judge where we gotwhat we got,&quot; the spokesman said.   Avon asserts the shredded documents are potentiallyrelevant to its efforts to show that the various Avonshareholders are still acting as a group and that togetherthey exceeded the 20% threshold that would trigger its poisonpill.   &quot;The federal court has said Avon should be free to use&quot;the documents, the spokesman said.   Mary Kay's lawsuit asserts Avon has conspired to get tradesecrets and confidential information.</TEXT></DOC>
