Brown IIIStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 04/27/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> AMR LABORAIRLINES (AIR) </IN><DATELINE> DALLAS  </DATELINE><TEXT>   American Airlines and its flight attendants union failed to reach a new agreement before the expiration of a 30-day cooling off period in their contract talks, freeing American to unilaterally impose its last offer.    The cooling off period expired at 12:01 a.m. EDT Saturday. A last-minute effort by two federal mediators from the National Mediation Board to bring the two sides to a settlement failed to produce a new agreement. American has been in talks with the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, which represents its 10,000 attendants, since August. The old contract became renewable in December.    Under the Federal Railway Labor Act, American, a unit of AMR Corp., now can impose its last contract offer. American has taken the position that it can implement only part of the contract, new work rules, while withholding the proposed pay increases until the union ratifies the pact. With the expiration of the cooling off period, the union is now free to strike. But it says it has no plans to do so.    The union has filed suit in federal court in Fort Worth, Texas, challenging American's interpretation of the labor act. It asked the court to prevent American from implementing the work rules without the pay increases. The hearing is scheduled May 11.    A union spokeswoman said the union put a new offer on the table Friday that significantly reduced its previous demands, but American rejected the proposal as too costly. A spokesman for American said the company is still hopeful it can reach a settlement through negotiations. However, he said no further talks are scheduled.    American said it would implement one new rule immediately that would allow it to staff its flight from Dallas to Tokyo, which begins May 21. The 13-hour trip exceeds work period limits under the old contract.    The remaining work rule changes will go into effect June 1, American said. They will allow American to staff some flights with fewer attendants and to tie pay more closely to actual flying time, reducing minimum flying time guarantees in some instances. The new rules also would reduce rest periods for flight attendants during layovers.    At a news conference Saturday, union president Patt Gibbs said the union would encourage flight attendants to strictly follow company regulations, which she said could result in flight delays and possible interruptions of service. The company has threatened to replace any flight attendants who participate in a work slowdown.    American said it won't give flight attendants the proposed pay increases in the contract offer until the union ratifies the agreement and discontinues its &quot;corporate campaign.&quot; In its campaign, the union has sought support from passengers, shareholders and directors to pressure the company to settle.    The union is seeking to topple American's two-tier wage scale, which pays attendants hired since 1983 significantly less than senior attendants. American says its contract offer would boost the average flight attendant's compensation to $14,900 in their first year and to $37,700 at the top of the wage scale. Under the previous contract, the range was from $13,500 to $37,100. </TEXT></DOC>
