<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-04-0293 </DOCNO><TEXT>This patent describes an apparatus for increasing the turbulence of acondensate layer formed on the inner surface of a mantle of a dryingcylinder for use in the drying section of a paper machine to improveits heat transfer characteristics. The device includes a plurality ofturbulence ribs attached to the inner mantle surface by a plurality ofattachment bands, each constituted by an assembly of at least three bandparts. Spring devices are associated with pairs of adjacent free endsof the band parts of each attachment band to urge the adjacent free endsaway from each other. The spring devices are tensioned by tensioningdevices. The turbulence ribs are attached to the bands, which are preferablyevenly spaced throughout the axial length of the mantle, by correspondingprojections and cavities. The apparatus is installed according to a methodwherein the band parts are inserted through an access opening providedin the drying cylinder mantle whereupon the attachment bands are assembledfrom the band parts within the cylinder mantle. The spring devices ofat least one central attachment band are tensioned at a higher tensioningforce than the other lateral bands.</TEXT></DOC>
