While central banks are seen continuing last week's modest intervention to curb the dollar's strength, currency-market participants will also be watching on Thursday when the Bundesbank central council reconvenes after a four-week summer recess. It has been widely speculated that the German central bank will move to tighten its monetary stance by either raising the 3% discount rate or the 5% Lombard rate.    The discount rate is the interest rate banks must pay on longer-term borrowings from the German central bank using bills as collateral. The Lombard rate is applied to very short-term borrowing using securities as collateral.    In the month prior to the recess, the Bundesbank raised both the discount rate and the Lombard rate by half a percentage point to their current levels. Also, the key securities-repurchase-agreements rate was recently ratcheted up to the present 4 1/4%, a rise of a full point in the past two months.    None of the moves has been of much aid to the mark, particularly since the U.S. raised its discount rate by half a point to 6.5% earlier this month.    However, some traders say the dollar could test support at 1.86 marks if the Bundesbank takes the aggressive tightening step of a discount-rate increase, but any losses are expected to be short-lived.    Says Ian Spence, chief dealer for Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.: &quot;I think the dollar is well supported on its own -- it's going to take a lot more than that to knock it down.&quot;    Against the yen, the dollar is expected to remain in its recent slim range of 130 to 135 this week.    The dollar continues to be bolstered by firmer U.S. interest rates, expectations for even-higher rates and the nation's strong economic performance this year.    &quot;I don't think the market is convinced yet that this is really the peak&quot; for the dollar, says Stephen Leach, a currency analyst for Chemical Bank.    Some traders say the dollar may make a run at 1.9260 marks in coming days, its highest level this year.    &quot;I see the dollar testing recent high levels, but it's not going to be a one-way street -- what you have to do is buy dips,&quot; says Jerry Egan, senior trader for Bank of Boston.    Participants say those likely slips may very well occur at the hands of the central banks, which have not really discouraged bullish dollar players with their recent intervention efforts.    Friday, the Fed and the Bundesbank took the foreign-exchange market by surprise when they were sighted intervening when the dollar was slightly softer on position-squaring. Those sales followed a round of concerted intervention by U.S. and European central banks Thursday and dual intervention by the Fed and the Bundesbank Wednesday.    However, the dollar held its ground despite those apparently modest actions. In late New York trading Friday, it stood at 1.8970 marks and 133.65 yen, compared with 1.8825 marks and 133.28 yen a week earlier. The pound traded at $1.6982, down from the week-earlier $1.7135.    In early trading Monday in Tokyo, the dollar rose to about 133.90 yen.    &quot;It's clear that the central banks are very determined to intervene and keep the dollar from going higher. But no one wants to sell the dollar,&quot; Mr. Leach says.    Market participants say corporations and institutional funds are among those flocking to the dollar, mainly because of the outlook for higher U.S. interest rates.    The U.S. discount rate increase is seen by many participants as a move that has paved the way for further rate boosts to combat inflationary pressures.    This week's U.S. economic data will probably be monitored for signs of overheating in the economy. Among figures to be unveiled is the July U.S. consumer price index, on Tuesday.    Economists generally expect the indicator, a closely watched inflation barometer, to post a gain of about 0.4%. A surprisingly high jump in prices for last month could support the argument for higher U.S. interest rates and push up the dollar.    On the New York Commodity Exchange Friday, gold for current delivery settled at $431.70 an ounce, down 60 cents from Thursday. Estimated volume was a light 1.7 million ounces.    In early trading Monday in Hong Kong, gold was quoted at $430.90 an ounce.    ---                    LATE NEW YORK TRADING                   Friday, August 19, 1988   Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates. -                           New York   Home Mkt.
