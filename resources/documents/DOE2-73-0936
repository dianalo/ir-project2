The purpose of this study was to estimate thereliability of the NMR technique in discriminating normal from malignanttissues. Breast and cervix samples were analyzed by using the malignancyindex concept and we were able to distinguish malignant and normal tissuein 17 out of 18 breast samples and 5 out of 7 cervix samples. Since therelaxation data of a normal control population of the other organs werenot available, the data for these are reported without any further analysis.The distinction between carcinomas and sarcomas was also made by usingthe estimated relaxation parameters. Malignancy indices of breast tissuesamples for linear least-squares and nonlinear two-parameter and three-parameterleast-squares procedures were calculated and used to evaluate the relativeefficiencies in discriminating malignant from normal tissues.</TEXT></DOC>
