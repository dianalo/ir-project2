Comptroller Robert Clarke, in remarks prepared for the American Bankers Association annual convention in Honolulu, said he doubts whether arguments against a merger are &quot;compelling&quot; in today's circumstances.    &quot;When your neighbor's house is on fire, the firefighters responding to the alarm won't ration water to make sure there is enough for you should your house go up in flames too,&quot; he said. &quot;They will pump until the fire at hand is out. And they will tap your private well to finish the job.&quot;    Bankers oppose suggestions that the FSLIC could be helped by a merger with the banks' stronger Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. The ABA, for example, contends that it would be unfair to make banks pay to rescue their competitors. Instead, it has called for the government to create a new corporation to close insolvent thrifts and hold some of their assets in the depressed Southwest until the local real estate market improves.    Like the ABA, Mr. Clarke has contended that the FDIC insurance fund lacks the resources to handle the massive liabilities of the FSLIC. A merger, he has said, would leave a combined institution that is shaky at best. And if the combination needed taxpayer help, it might be subjected to Treasury Department control, he warned.    But Mr. Clarke warned bankers against refusing to negotiate. &quot;If the banking community refuses to acknowledge even the mere possibility of using FDIC funds as part of a solution to the thrift crisis, it is walking away from the table,&quot; he said. &quot;When you deal yourself out at the beginning of the game, you may find it difficult or impossible to get back in when the game changes.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
