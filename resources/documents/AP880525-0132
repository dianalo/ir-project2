The report was issued an hour after President Reagan left forMoscow and his summit meeting with Soviet leader Mikhail S.Gorbachev. One of the topics on the agenda is the proposedStrategic Arms Reduction Talks (START).   ``No START agreement will come out of the summit next week andthat's good,'' said Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of thecommittee. ``There is a great deal to be done before arms controlpolicy and weapons system decisions are harmonized.''   The proposed START agreement would affect the long-range arsenalof each nation. It is being negotiated now and is designed as asuccessor to the separate U.S.-Soviet treaty eliminatingmedium-range missiles, a pact now before the Senate forratification.   The outlines of the proposed START agreement generally call foreach side to cut its long-range arsenal by about 50 percent, to6,000 weapons, Aspin said.   But weapons-counting provisions which Aspin said have alreadybeen agreed to on both sides would allow the Soviets to legally addas many as 3,000 warheads _ and the Soviets could add up to 4,300more if they cheat, the Wisconsin Democrat noted.   ``All of this does not mean we should abandon arms controlgenerally or START in particular,'' Aspin said. ``What it does sayis that we should look to the structure of our own forces toguarantee deterrence.''   The warnings were issued by the defense policy panel, an ArmedServices subcommittee which Aspin has used to examine arms controlissues.   The proposed limit of 6,000 weapons ``is an illusion,'' thestudy said. That is because of the proposed counting rules whichtreat each bomber as a single weapon _ regardless of how manynuclear weapons, such as bombs or missiles, are carried on eachplane.   ``The United States also would be allowed similar additionalweapons,'' it said. ``In fact, because the United States has morebombers, it would probably end up with more legal weapons.''   ``Thus, the actual ceiling on weapons under START is more like9,000-10,000 on each side, rather than 6,000,'' the panel said.   The Soviets would also be able to cheat, particularly since theproposed START pact would not ban flight tests of permittedweapons. Weapons could be hidden without fears about theircapability because some could be flight-tested, it noted.   The issue is similar to one which was raised as part of themedium-range missile pact, Aspin said. Among the weapons banned bythat pact is the Soviet SS-20 and the Soviets have declared astockpile of 250 of the weapons which must be destroyed.   Some U.S. intelligence agencies believe that even more SS-20smay be hidden, but their military value will degrade, according tosupporters of the treaty, because the pact bans any flight tests.   ``START will not ban flight tests, so the military capability ofany concealed forces will not decline over time,'' giving theSoviets incentive to cheat, the study said.   It said the Soviets could also break out any START treatyquicker than the United States.   The reason is that ``given the history of U.S. strategic armsdevelopment, it seems unlikely that the president would proposesuch a course (a break-out) or the Congress approve it. A U.S.planner, however, could not rely upon internal checks and balancesin the Soviet Union.''   Thus, ``the United States must plan for a Soviet force not of6,000 weapons, but of many, many more,'' the study said.   Stricter verification is not the answer because no verificationis likely to be strict enough, it said. Besides, procedures such asanytime, anywhere inspections might hurt the United States becausethe Soviet inspections would be given the same right to look atU.S. facilities.</TEXT></DOC>
