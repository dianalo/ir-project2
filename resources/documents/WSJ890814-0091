Their West Chester, Pa., company, Claren Inc., was posting losses. The management was unsettled, partly because the couple was divorced. Amid toughening competition, the family operation, then only two stores selling personal computers and peripherals, had no long-term plan for survival. At stake was a family investment of $600,000.    That was in 1987. Junior -- 20-year-old Robert &quot;Sam&quot; Means Jr. -- got the top job. His mother recalls admonishing herself, &quot;I'm going to do what he wants me to do.&quot;    Ceding control to the younger generation, always a delicate process, is made all the more complicated when a company is troubled. At the very time that tough decisions are needed to revive the company, family members are also trying to define their new roles in the business. Whether a newly installed son or daughter can face those tough decisions, even at the risk of disrupting family ties, often determines whether the business will survive.    Sometimes, says Ronald Drucker, a small-business consultant for Laventhol andamp; Horwath, &quot;Everyone is busy working the oars, but no one wants to look at the compass.&quot; He says only a tiny percentage of family businesses negotiate the transition from the founding generation to the next, though the odds generally improve if outside managers are recruited.    Claren illustrates emphatically both the promise and the turmoil in this situation. Turning the business over to a family member barely out of his teens was a tremendous risk. Though it's too early to tell whether an initial sharp turnaround will become a lasting success, so far the gamble is paying off.    Sam Means, now 22, has shown all the brashness of youth. Sweeping into his new position as general manager of the company, he cut up his parents' company credit cards and even fired his older sister, Elizabeth, who was general manager of the warehouse. He has transformed the two-store operation into a franchise chain with 102 outlets in 25 states.    Sales soared more than sixfold to $25.5 million last year from $4 million in 1986, and the company projects chainwide revenue of $75 million this year. Claren had pretax profit of $1.2 million in 1988, after breaking even in 1986.    In June, the accounting firm Arthur Young andamp; Co., having reviewed Claren's books and operations, chose it as one of the best young companies in the Philadelphia area. Sam Means, who will collect a salary and bonus totaling about $700,000 this year, figures he'll be a millionaire by November.    &quot;I live and breathe the business,&quot; he says. &quot;I'm not here to be second best.&quot;    Claren, formerly called Pennsylvania Computers, was started seven years ago in the Means home, just two months before Robert and Gladys were divorced. Initially, the elder Mr. Means sold computer disks as a sideline; he and Gladys continued to work full time as academic psychologists. In 1983, the business grew into a computer store in West Chester; four years later, it opened a second store, in Princeton, N.J. The company remained a casual, marginally profitable affair where the owners hired family and friends.    But with the modest growth, things started to go awry. Costs were ballooning out of proportion to sales. Competing chains, such as ComputerLand and Businessland Inc., were growing ever bigger.    Family members say the lines of authority began to waver. Robert and Gladys, who often failed to coordinate their decisions, disagreed over when to draw on company funds for personal use. Robert and Elizabeth disagreed over how to run the warehouse. Several times, Robert threatened to pull out of the company.    &quot;I let the family play a part of the business,&quot; Robert says. &quot;That breeds a lot of problems.&quot;    The biggest problem: The West Chester store posted a loss of $150,000 for the first half of 1987. The company, though never highly profitable, had never suffered such a setback.    But Sam was producing results. As a teen-ager, he had helped out in the stockroom and on the sales floor. After dropping out of Boston University in 1987, he returned to the business to run the Princeton store. It had a $16,000 profit in the same six months as the West Chester store's big loss. Family members say Sam succeeded by making his store more organized than the West Chester outlet, where inventories weren't taken regularly and accounts weren't kept current.    The disparity in the stores' performance prompted the owners to make a change. Although Robert and Gladys Means had some qualms about the inexperience of their son, they had confidence in his competitiveness and organizational skills. Besides, they decided they didn't really want to turn to an outsider. So early last year, they named Sam general manager of the company and gave him a one-third equity interest.    The younger Mr. Means says he felt a heavy, even fearful, obligation to salvage his parents' business. But he also saw it as a way to build his retailing empire. He sought and was given final authority on business decisions. &quot;Someone has to be the boss,&quot; he says. &quot;You don't have debates or you'll move too slow.&quot;    At a family meeting soon after Sam took over, Elizabeth, then 24, was &quot;fired slash quit,&quot; she says. Sam says it was difficult to fire his sister, but he adds, &quot;You have to decide what you want to do and do it. You can't get emotionally involved.&quot;    Sam proceeded to cut costs with something less than a light touch. There were rapid firings of workers -- including family friends -- who, he says, &quot;knew about computers but weren't into making money.&quot; The work force shrank to 15 from 30.    Where Robert Means concedes that he couldn't separate personal loyalties from business needs, his son didn't hesitate. &quot;Sam is enough of a jerk&quot; to put the company before friends and family, the father says.    Only reluctantly did the son buy a new desktop computer for his marketing staff. Claren went through the scorching summer of 1988 without office air conditioning; it was finally installed this summer.    As cash flow improved, his mother suggested a pay raise for employees. Sam's response: &quot;This is not a charity, Mom.&quot;    The father observes, &quot;Sam is a little too tough.&quot;    Hard work, Sam says, &quot;is where you're going to make it or break it.&quot; He pushes himself hard, too, as do some buddies he has brought into the company. His best friend, Patrick Rucker, also 22, has served as warehouse manager and now is sales manager. On several occasions, Messrs. Means and Rucker have driven trucks in the middle of the night to pick up a delivery in New York instead of waiting the next day for the shipment.    Recognizing the need for a more professional atmosphere and image, Sam also hired two of his father's more experienced friends to run the operations and accounting control departments.    Perhaps most important, Sam Means rolled out the franchise strategy with a vengeance. With franchisees providing most of the funds for expansion, he sees it as the route to fast growth, that will let Claren compete against the big chains. And he is counting on the franchise operators, with their personal stakes in individual stores, to turn a better profit for both the store and Claren.    The parent company acts as a middleman that, because of its volume, can buy IBM-compatible machines at a discount. Then Claren sells the merchandise, at a 6% markup, to its franchises.    Where the company used to wait for business to fall into its lap, Sam Means has planned a broad advertising campaign, which he says will be ready to hit local and national business publications and local radio outlets by December.    By now, the rest of the family is uniting behind their tyro tycoon. Elizabeth has been rehired as a marketing manager, where Sam thinks her strengths lie; Gladys runs the Princeton store, and Robert serves as a consultant. Sam's stepmother heads the accounts-payable department, and his 18-year-old sister, Lee Ann, works part time in sales. He hopes his nine-year-old sister, Claire, and infant half-sister, Lauren, will eventually occupy positions in the business.    But the company, at its present rate of growth, must face new challenges that will test its willingness to keep the business all in the family. The elder Mr. Means suggests that the company may need more professional management as it grows beyond what Sam may be able to handle.    The son? He doesn't see a problem, though he acknowledges he must learn to hand some responsibility to others. For now, he says of the family business, &quot;It's not growing fast enough for me.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
