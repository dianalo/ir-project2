(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   It's high tourist season in SantaCruz, but only on one side of town.   Tanned, oil-slicked bodies adorn the main beach. Thousands morevisitors pack the garish amusement parks that line the 1907boardwalk.   But just two miles inland, the other foremost tourist attractionin this city of 50,000 has been transformed by the Oct. 17earthquake into a zone of shattered buildings, craters andscaffolding.   ``The heart of Santa Cruz has been ripped out, and it's notbeing replaced,'' said Julie Chapton of the once-thriving PacificGarden Mall, a district of coffeehouses, boutiques and restaurantsthat she frequently visited from her home in Scotts Valley, justnorth of the city.   ``It tears your heart out when you come down here,'' she said.   Officials say it could be anywhere from three years to a decadebefore the six-block district is rebuilt and booming again.   The Northern California quake, measuring 7.2 on the Richterscale, was centered 10 miles from Santa Cruz, which overlooksMonterey Bay. Nearly half the mall was badly damaged or destroyed,and three people were killed.   So far, the city has tallied $112 million in quake damage,including $51 million to businesses. Tourism remains strong, butvisitors are drawn mainly to beach areas largely untouched by thequake.   Locals who shy away from the tourist-clogged boardwalk sorelymiss the tree-lined mall, which was a popular rendezvous.Rebuilding work is taking too long, they say.   The city's finance director, Bob Shepherd, said reconstructionwill be slow because the new buildings must meet regulationsgoverning quake-proofing. He thinks it could be 10 years before thedistrict is back on its feet.   ``The downtown is an absolute wreck,'' Shepherd said. ``Peoplecompare it to Hiroshima right after the bomb. It's really adepressing thing.''   Mental health workers say the rubble can leave passersbydepressed and anxious. Project COPE, a federally funded quakecounseling group run by the city, has treated 16,000 people in thelast eight months, said supervisor Jill Hofmann.   ``It's hard to work in that area because you are constantlysurrounded by what looks like a war zone,'' she said.   The city has lost about half its yearly $1 million in sales taxrevenue, officials say.   About 100 of the city's 630 businesses never resurfaced afterthe disaster. Others work out of tent-like plastic pavilions set upa block from the mall, struggling on sales that are sometimes 25percent of pre-quake levels.   But there are signs of renewal.   The mall's Palomar Hotel should be ready for occupancy by theend of the year. Investors recently bought the mall site of thequake-leveled Gottschalk's department store, and a 400-car parkinglot is being built alongside. No decision has been made on whatwill be built where the store stood.   The Natural Treasures gift shop lost about $1,500 worth of goodsin the quake, and sales have slumped by more than 50 percent, saidits manager, Frank Morgan.   ``For the most part, I think everybody lost out,'' he said.``But on the other hand, we're very lucky to be here.''</TEXT></DOC>
