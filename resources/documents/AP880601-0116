Gorbachev and President Reaganconcluded four days of summit talks today with an impasse on amajor arms control agreement but muted differences on human rights.The Soviet leader called their meetings ``a blow to the foundationsof the Cold War'' and Reagan said ``we must not stop here.''   In remarks after their formal talks ended with smiles andhandshakes, Gorbachev said Reagan had disavowed his description ofthe Soviet Union as an ``evil empire,'' and noted with satisfactionthat he did it ``within the walls of the Kremlin.''   Reagan in turn praised Gorbachev's moves to open up hiscountry's society to the point of suggesting that Soviet refusal topermit thousands of dissidents to emigrate over a period of severaldecades may be due to an unresponsive bureaucracy rather thandeliberate government policy.   Asked at a news conference if he wasn't letting Gorbachev off alittle too easy on that score, Reagan replied, ``I just have tobelieve that in any sort of government some of us do find ourselvesbound in by bureaucracy.''   Both men vowed to persist in efforts to negotiate a new treatycalling for sweeping reductions in nuclear weapons despite theirinability to achieve a breakthrough in four days in Moscow.   The president said he hopes for an arms control agreement by theend of his term in January to supplement the INF treaty that wasformally ratified during his four days in Russia. But, he quicklyadded, ``I am dead set against deadlines.''   ``We can look with optimism on future negotiations,'' he said,even he continued to defend his proposal for Star Wars, which hasbeen a key stumbling block in superpower arms-control negotiations.   ``The conversations are still going on and they are still beingdiscussed and I say progress is still being made or we wouldn't betalking as we are,'' he said. But Reagan said ``I honestly can'tanswer that question'' when asked whether he thought he andGorbachev would meet once more time as the leaders of the twosuperpowers.   It was Reagan's decision to soft-pedal differences on humanrights that seemed likely to be his most memorable comments at anews conference televised live in the United States _ particularlyafter his meeting two days earlier with dissidents who told himpersonally of their imprisonment and internment in labor campsduring their struggle to emigrate.   The leaders ended their fourth summit by exchanging thedocuments of ratification of the intermediate-range nuclear armstreaty (INF) signed last December. They said they will press tocomplete an elusive agreement to cut strategic nuclear weapons byup to 50 percent.   ``The first lines have already been written into a book of theworld without nuclear weapons,'' Gorbachev said. ``... I don'tthink anyone can close that book and put it aside.''   In his news conference _ the first such session ever held by aSoviet leader in Moscow _ Gorbachev said the president's StrategicDefense Initiative remained as one key obstacle to an offensivearms agreement, along with a dispute over limits on submarinelaunched cruise missiles.   He said he told Reagan that the view that the so-called StarWars program is strictly a defensive one is ``just not serious.''The issue snagged dramatic bargaining during the second sumit heldin 1986 in Iceland.   In a brief ceremony in the Kremlin's St. Vladimir Hall, Reaganand Gorbachev shook hands four separate times, giving no indicationthat differences on issues had soured the warm personalrelationship they have displayed here. In his remarks to reporters,Gorbachev generally praised Reagan although he said Americaneconomic and arms policies were often contradictory.   Gorbachev summarized their meetings as ``big politics, politicsthat affect millions of millions of people.'' He said that with theINF treaty, ``the era of nuclear disarmament has begun.''`   Reagan, praising the INF treaty as historic because it mandatesthe elimination of an entire class of nuclear weapons, said, ``Wemust not stop here, Mr. general secretary. There is much more to bedone.''   Despite the lack of major agreements, it was an upbeat windup tothe fourth summit in 30 months between the two leaders and thefirst visit to Moscow by an American president in 14 years.   Gorbachev made a point of noting that Reagan had said he nolonger viewed the Soviet Union as an ``evil empire.'' Reagan saidTuesday he had been talking about ``another time, another era.''   The Soviet leader said, ``We take note of this,'' remarking that``Everything flows, everything changes.''   In the absence in a strategic arms pact, Gorbachev said ``wewill not make any dramatic conclusions'' at this summit. However,he said, they were moving ``step by step'' toward an eventualtreaty.   Reagan had made a point during his visit of mixing criticismwith praise for the Soviet record on human rights and freedom.Gorbachev said that when Reagan ``tried to persuade me to change mymind,'' I said, your explanations are not convincing... I am notfilled with admiration at this aspect of the visit..''   In developing his theme, Gorbachev said, ``... But big politicsmeans difficult politics,'' a reference perhaps to the strategicarms negotiations that remains snagged, and to the human rightsissues that continue to divide the superpower nations.   ``Big politics also means big responsibility,'' he continued.``It cannot be built on pursuing only one`s own interest'' in themovements toward ``a nuclear free and non-violent world.''   ``President Reagan and I have agreed that the immediate taskbefore us,'' achievement of a reduction of 50 percent in strategicnuclear arsenals, ``can and must be accomplished,'' the Sovietleader said.   Reagan and Gorbachev congratulated each other, and exchangedpens used to sign the INF documents, while an audience ofhigh-ranking officials and dignitaries looked on. First ladiesNancy Reagan and Raisa Gorbachev sat next to one another on thefront row.   December's intermediate-range nuclear arms treaty requires thedestruction of all nuclear missiles on each side with a range of300 to 3,400 miles. It was the first superpower nuclear arms pactin 16 years.   The far more expansive treaty that eluded Reagan and Gorbachevwould have provided for cuts of 30 to 50 percent in thesuperpowers' stockpiles of strategic missiles, bombers andsubmarines.   Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., and SenateMinority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., who present for the exchange oftreaty documents, said it was unlikely the Senate would have adebate and ratification vote on a strategic missile treaty, even ifReagan and Gorbachev negotiated such a pact before Reagan leavesoffice next January.   ``My suggestion would be that we make haste slowly, that we notgo too fast,'' Byrd said at a joint news conference with Dole.``There are big problems ... a verification terrain that would bestrewn with booby traps and mine-fields.''</TEXT></DOC>
