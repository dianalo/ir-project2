The report said customs authorities were investigating sixHong Kong companies, some of which have already been linkedto China's weapons-purchasing authorities.   While the U.S. has said it will lift some sanctionsimposed on China, the Telegraph said some of the systemsshipped to China -- including Vax computers that are fastenough to run Patriot missile guidance systems -- would stillbe restricted.   The State Department said last Friday that the sanctionswere being lifted because China had promised to abide by theMissile Technology Control Regime, which aims to restrict thespread of advanced missile technology and weaponry.</TEXT></DOC>
