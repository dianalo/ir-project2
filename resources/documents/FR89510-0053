In addition, WPL requests separate blanket authorityto import up to 100,000 Mcf per day of spot market natural gas from variousCanadian producers over a two-year period beginning on the date of thefirst delivery. WPL intends to use the imported gas under both short-termand blanket authorizations to supply customers on its system. It is contemplatedthat the gas supplied under the blanket authorization would be importedby WPL either for its own account, or as broker or agent on behalf of others.WPL states that no new pipeline facilities would be required for the transportationof these imports.The application is filed pursuant to Section 3 of the Natural Gas Act andDOE Delegation Order No. 0204-111 and 0204-127. Protests, motions to intervene,notices of intervention and written comments are invited.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Protests, motions to intervene or notices of intervention,as applicable, requests for additional procedures and written commentsare to be filed no later than June 9, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION:</T2>Frank Duchaine, Office of Fuels Programs, Fossil Energy, U.S. Departmentof Energy, Forrestal Building, Room 3H-087, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW.,Washington, DC 20585 (202) 586-8233.Michael Skinker, Natural Gas and Mineral Leasing, Office of General Counsel,U.S. Department of Energy, Forrestal Building, Room 6E-042, 1000 IndependenceAvenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585 (202) 586-6667.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>With regard to the requested short-termauthorization, WPL furnished with its application a precedent agreementand gas purchase contract with TransCanada dated October 26, 1988. Underthe terms of the contract, TransCanada will supply WPL up to a maximumof 4,287 Mcf of gas per day on a firm basis for a term extending throughOctober 31, 1992. The contract contains a provision giving WPL the rightto purchase up to 6,431 Mcf per day of additional interruptible suppliesthat may become available and offered by TransCanada from time to time.According to this application, WPL is not obligated to take or pay forany volume of gas. The contract provides that if, during any contract year,the volumes purchased by WPL fall below 60 percent of the aggregate ofthe maximum daily quantities, then TransCanada may elect in the succeedingyear to reduce the daily contract quantity of 4,287 Mcf.The proposed gas purchase contract between WPL and TransCanada establishesa two-part rate structure consisting of a monthly demand charge and a monthlycommodity charge. The demand charge would equal the product of the dailycontract quantity in effect during such month times the sum of the tollcharges of TransCanada and Nova Corporation of Alberta for transportationof the gas in Canada. The commodity charge to be paid for each MMBtu offirm supplies at 100 percent load factor is calculated based upon a formulathat reflects the price of spot market gas delivered into ANR's gas transmissionsystem at Custer County, Oklahoma. Notwithstanding the actual computedprice, the contract contains a provision that WPL would have to pay a deliveredborder price for the gas of at least $1.50 (U.S.) per MMBtu. For each MMBtuof interruptible supplies, the commodity charge paid by WPL will be basedupon the same formula in effect for firm volumes less five cents. The agreementalso provides that the parties may negotiate modification of the pricingprovisions. In an April 14, 1989, letter, WPL indicated that the pricingformula would result in a delivered charge of $1.43 per MMBtu for April1989. Thus, the price WPL would pay for April 1989 would be adjusted to$1.50 per MMBtu.The volumes to be supplied under the agreement with TransCanada would enterthe U.S. at a point near Emerson, Manitoba, by means of existing pipelinefacilities owned and operated by Midwestern Gas Transmission Company (Midwestern).Midwestern would transport the gas to an interconnection with the facilitiesof ANR Pipeline Company (ANR) at Marshfield, Wisconsin, which would thenuse its existing facilities to deliver the gas to WPL's distribution system.Under the requested blanket authority, the specific terms of each spotmarket transaction would be negotiated on an individual basis with market-sensitivepricing. No contracts have been executed and therefore the applicationdoes not identify the suppliers, buyers, or prices. The spot gas wouldbe transported by means of existing transmission facilities, however, thelocation where it would enter the U.S. may vary for different transactionswith delivery points to be established during sales contract negotiations.In support of its application, WPL asserts that the proposed import volumesare needed to meet its system requirements and that the gas purchase agreementwith TransCanada provides for a competitive price over the term of thearrangement. In addition, WPL submits that TransCanada has a record ofproviding reliable gas supplies.The decision on this application will be made consistent with the DOE'sgas import policy guidelines, under which the competitiveness of an importarrangement in the markets served is the primary consideration in determiningwhether it is in the public interest (49 FR 6684, February 22, 1984). Partiesthat may oppose this application should comment in their responses on theissue of competitiveness as set forth in the policy guidelines. The applicantasserts that this import arrangement is competitive. Parties opposing thearrangement bear the burden of overcoming this assertion.All parties should be aware that if this request is granted, the authorizationwould be conditioned on the filing of quarterly reports to facilitate monitoringof the operation and effectiveness of DOE's import program.<ITAG tagnum="84">NEPA Compliance</ITAG>The DOE has determined that compliance with the National EnvironmentalPolicy Act of 1969 (NEPA), 42 U.S.C. 4321 <T3>et seq.,</T3> can be accomplished by means of a categorical exclusion.On March 27, 1989, the DOE published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (54 FR 12474) a notice of amendments to its guidelinesfor compliance with NEPA. In that notice, the DOE added to its list ofcategorical exclusions the approval or disapproval of an import/exportauthorization for natural gas in cases not involving new construction.Application of the categorical exclusion in any particular case raisesa rebuttable presumption that the DOE's action is not a major Federal actionunder NEPA. Unless the DOE receives comments indicating that the presumptiondoes not or should not apply in this case, no further NEPA review willbe conducted by the DOE.<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comment Procedures</ITAG>In response to this notice, any person may file a protest, motion to interveneor notice of intervention, as applicable, and written comments. Any personwishing to become a party to the proceeding and to have the written commentsconsidered as the basis for any decision on the application must, however,file a motion to intervene or notice of intervention, as applicable. Thefiling of a protest with respect to this application will not serve tomake the protestant a party to the proceeding, although protests and commentsreceived from persons who are not parties will be considered in determiningthe appropriate action to be taken on the application. All protests, motionsto intervene, notices of intervention, and written comments must meet therequirements that are specified by the regulations in 10 CFR Part 590.Protests, motions to intervene, notices of intervention, requests for additionalprocedures, and written comments should be filed with the Office of FuelsPrograms, Fossil Energy, Room 3F-056, FE-50, Forrestal Building, 1000 IndependenceAvenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585, (202) 586-9478. They must be filed nolater than 4:30 p.m., e.d.t., June 9, 1989.
