The guidance is specificallyintended to provide the fundamental approach necessary to meet the performanceassessment requirements of DOE Order 5820.2, Chapter III. The documentis written for LLW facility operators or other waste management personnelwho will manage the performance assessment task. It is also intendedto provide guidance for conducting performance assessments in a generallyconsistent manner at all DOE LLW disposal, treatment, and storage facilities.The guidance includes: a summary of performance objectives to be metby LLW disposal, treatment, and storage facilities derived from currentDOE and other applicable federal regulatory guidelines; specific criteriafor an adequate performance assessment from which a minimum set of requiredcalculations may be determined; recommendations of methods for screeningcritical components of the system that should be addressed in detail;recommendations for the selection of existing models and the developmentof site-specific models; recommendations of techniques for comparisonof assessment results with performance objectives; and a summary of reportingrequirements. For the purpose of this document, radiological performanceassessment is defined as a systematic analysis of a LLW treatment, storage,or disposal facility and its environs for the purpose of demonstratingcompliance with specific radiological performance objectives for protectionof the public. The definition does not address worker protection or thenon-radiological components of LLW.</TEXT></DOC>
