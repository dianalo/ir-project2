A statement reported by the official Angolan news agency ANGOPsaid women and children were among several hundred civilians killedby South African strikes around four southern towns. The ANGOPreport was monitored in Lisbon.   South Africa's military headquarters, which says its recentbombardments and air strikes have been aimed at military targets,described the Angolan claim as ``blatant propaganda.''   ANGOP said three South African Mirage war planes were shot downbetween Sunday and Wednesday during the attacks in the southernprovinces of Cunene and Cuando Cubango. South Africa has confirmedthe loss of one plane.   Residential areas close to the towns of Cuito Cuanavale, Onjiva,Cuvelai and Mulondo were bombed by South African aircraft,inflicting severe material damage along with the casualties, thedefense ministry said.   It said long-range G-5 artillery pieces also were used to shellAngolan army positions around Cuito Cuanavale, a strategic garrisonfor the Angolan government's offensive against the SouthAfrican-backed rebel movement UNITA.   South African aircraft on Thursday also began bombing theoutskirts of the city of Lubango, in Huila province, north ofCunene, the ministry added.   The statement said the attacks were part of a South Africanoperation aimed at cutting off supply routes to Cuito Cuanvale andOnjiva, ANGOP reported.   Angola accuses South Africa of engaging in a major militaryincursion and occupying large areas of southern Angola to supportUNITA, the National Union for the Total Liberation of Angola.   The rebels, also supported by the United States, have beenfighting since 1975 to force Angola's Soviet- and Cuban-backedgovernment to share power.   South African war planes struck Saturday at Lubango and Onjivain what it said were Angola bases of the South-West AfricanPeople's Organization, a guerrilla organization fighting for theindependence of neighboring South-West Africa, also known asNamibia.   South Africa said the attacks were in retaliation for a bomb theday before, allegedly carried out by SWAPO, that killed 23 peopleat a Namibian bank.</TEXT></DOC>
