The broadcasting and publishing concern earned $99.7 million, or $5.88 a share, in the second quarter, up from $67 million, or $4.15 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 5.7% to $1.13 billion from $1.07 billion.    Capital Cities attributed its profit gain to strong performances by its television stations and to cost reduction measures. The company's quarterly operating costs rose less than 1%.    The results were better than analysts had expected. Zacks Investment Research Inc. in Chicago, which polled 10 analysts, said the average second-quarter earnings estimate for the company was $5.19 a share. Zacks said some analysts had even been lowering their estimates in the last week or so.    In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Capital Cities/ABC shares rose $11.25 to close at $408.50.    Revenue from broadcasting increased 6%, and revenue from publishing operations rose 3%. Despite disappointing ratings, ABC television network revenue increased slightly, the company said.    Capital Cities warned that the outlook for the second half of 1987 &quot;continues to be uncertain.&quot; Profit is likely to show &quot;little, if any, improvement&quot; over the year-earlier period. Advertising demand remains soft, the company said, and a new audience measurement system, scheduled to begin in September, also could affect the network's ratings.    Pre-tax operating profit from broadcasting operations rose 32% to $237.7 million from $180.4 million, buoyed by strong local advertising, the company said. ABC television network earned a higher operating profit in the quarter than a year earlier, after special accounting adjustments relating to the ABC acquisition.    Pre-tax operating profit from publishing dropped 3% to $43.9 million from $45.1 million. The company attributed the drop to &quot;general softness in print media advertising demand.&quot;    The company had an average of 16.8 million shares of common outstanding, up from 16.2 million last year.    In the six months, Capital Cities net income fell to $123.7 million, or $7.35 a share, from $349 million, or $21.60 a share. Year-earlier net includes a one-time gain of $280 million, or $17.36 a share, from the sale of cable television and other assets stemming from Capital Cities' acquisition of American Broadcasting Cos. in January 1986. Revenue rose 5% to $2.09 billion from $1.98 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
