It is mentionedthat in such systems the rippling of the magnetic field produces stabilizing(or destabilizing) effect depending on concrete geometry of the confiningmagnetic field. Stability of Mercier modes at high pressure tokamak isconsidered. It is shown that under the pressure increase in tokamak therippling of the magnetic field may exert a stabilizing effect on Merciermode evolution.</TEXT></DOC>
