The major advantages of MR imagingover a CT scan are in the diagnosis of chronic hematomas, repeated hemorrhageswhich may be subclinical, and brain edema adjacent to hematomas and thehemosiderin ring. In addition, direct sagittal views provide an additionalperspective in the localization of niduses, feeding arteries, and drainingveins in cases with angiographically visible AVMs. On the other hand,though in only 2 out of the 4 angiographically occult AVMs, small niduseswere retrospectively identified as areas of a signal void on both T/sub1/-weighted and T/sub 2/-weighted images. However, in these angiographicallyoccult AVMs, the signal loss of small niduses was often difficult todifferentiate from small calcifications on MR imaging. It was concludedfrom this study that, at the present time, MR imaging is definitely avery useful technique in the diagnosis and management of cerebral AVMs.However, MR and high-resolution CT are complementary in the evaluationof calcification.</TEXT></DOC>
