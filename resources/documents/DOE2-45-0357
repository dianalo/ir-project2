Included in this study were 40 patients with histologically provenskin cancer. Thirty five patients were considered to be exposed to {ge}one cGy. There was statistically significant correlation between theincidence of skin cancer and exposure doses in both men and women (pandless; 0.01). Overall, the incidence of skin cancer was significantly correlatedas well with the distance from the hypocenter; however, this was notsignificant when restricted to either men or women. Because the incidenceof skin cancer has definitively increased since 1955 among A-bomb survivors,follow-up of A-bomb survivors is warranted with respect to atomic bomb-relatedskin cancer.
