The lower fee will be only for fiscal 1990.;    It remains unclear,however, whether the county will ever see any of that money. The CaliforniaSchool Boards Association filed suit in January, challenging the fees law asunconstitutional.;    During last summer's budget crisis, the stateLegislature passed the property tax fee and a companion measure allowingcounties to charge police agencies for booking prisoners into county jails.The two fee laws were passed as a consolation prize when state legislators cut$700 million in funds to county-administered programs.;    In December, SantaClara County implemented the booking fees, which will raise an estimated $6.1million a year.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  STEPHEN ROBITAILLE, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910320  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  5B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  198  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday March 20, 199100080158,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
