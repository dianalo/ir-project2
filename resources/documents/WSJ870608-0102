But the unanimous NATO decision opens a whole new set of problems that revolve around West Germany.    &quot;The alliance is all about the German problem at the end of the day,&quot; says a British official, &quot;and this agreement over a piddling few missiles has caused considerable strain on the German body politic that will trouble us for some time to come.&quot;    A senior U.S. official says the maneuvering to get the reluctant West German government to agree to the proposal is having troubling effects:    It is straining the ruling coalition in Bonn by strengthening the hand of West Germany's relatively soft-on-Moscow foreign minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, at the expense of Chancellor Helmut Kohl. It threatens to make West Germany feel more isolated from Europe and the U.S. as the only likely setting for any war using the battlefield nuclear weapons that remain; Mr. Kohl complains that the removal of intermediate-range weapons will make Germany &quot;a special nuclear zone&quot; where battlefield weapons would be used in war. It also will undercut support by Germany -- and perhaps the broader alliance -- for modernizing those remaining battlefield weapons.    Even as the allies were reaching final agreement on the Soviet proposal last week, quibbling arose over the wording of this week's NATO communique. U.S. and British officials want the document to assert that the agreements to remove intermediate-range and short-range nuclear weapons will be the last nuclear-arms-control agreements in Europe. The elimination of nuclear weapons from Europe would leave the continent vulnerable to Moscow's superior conventional forces, U.S. officials fear. The U.S. wants to encourage NATO to carry out an existing plan to modernize its battlefield nuclear weapons.    Bonn officials oppose such a communique. It would constitute &quot;a NATO endorsement of a nuclear situation where only the two German states can be vaporized,&quot; a West German official explains. A British official worries that such fears in the wake of the missile accords ultimately could harm the alliance by encouraging neutralist feelings in West Germany.    Just as the powerful German peace movement forced Chancellor Kohl to accept the missile proposals, so will Bonn's domestic politics intervene again to influence security debates in the months ahead, making allied consensus more difficult and giving Moscow more political opportunities to exploit.    NATO's commander, Gen. Bernard Rogers, complained last week that the allied process of reaching agreement on the Soviet proposal has shown that &quot;the political credibility of our governments and political parties and the images of leaders in alliance nations have higher priority than the credibility of our deterrent.&quot;    A U.S. official says he is most troubled that the agreement gives Mr. Genscher, a foreign minister who many in Washington consider too trusting of the Soviets, the upper hand over a more strongly pro-American defense minister, Manfred Woerner, and Chancellor Kohl, who opposed the Soviet offer to abolish all short-range Euromissiles.    &quot;I think that's very damaging that they fought that battle and lost,&quot; says the official. In the future, he fears, Mr. Woerner will be less willing to stand up for NATO defense interests and less likely to win when he does fight.    This change in the balance of domestic political power in Bonn could have an important impact on NATO's ability to implement its 1983 &quot;Montebello decision&quot; to modernize within 10 years its arsenal of battlefield nuclear weapons -- those with a range of less than 300 miles. The modernization is supposed to compensate for a decision to scrap about 1,400 of these weapons.    The allies this week in Iceland also will be feuding about how their response to the Soviet offer affects this decision. Many U.S. officials say it is now more critical than ever to carry through or even speed up the modernization to show the Soviets that NATO's security resolve isn't weakened. &quot;The modernization portion of the Montebello decision,&quot; must be implemented, Gen. Rogers says.    But again the West Germans say they won't get the domestic backing to update systems of such short range that they would fall on German soil.    &quot;Our Western problem is that we regard arms control as a laudable aim in and of itself, while the Soviets view it as a political tool,&quot; says a West German official. &quot;This time, they have used that tool quite deftly.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
