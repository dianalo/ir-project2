The guerrillas say the snow that clogs the winding trails willconfine their military activities mainly to harassment of communisttroops until the spring thaw.   They say the harsh weather prevents them from launching majorassaults on Afghan cities vacated by the withdrawing Soviet army.   Winter has turned the imposing peaks that have harbored the U.S.and Pakistan-backed guerrillas during their 10-year war against thecommunists into frigid citadels.   The turbaned fighters huddled in blankets say that until spring,they will concentrate on weakening government forces by harassingthem and blocking their overland supply routes of food and fuel.   ``God willing, we are near to freedom,'' said Jabbar, already aseasoned guerrilla with the hard-line Yunis Khalis faction at theage of 24. Ten years ago, he traded his textbooks for a Soviet-madeKalashnikov assault rifle.   ``But until the spring we can't do much,'' says Rahoney Wardak,who along with his two brothers commands several hundred guerrillasin Afghanistan's central and southern provinces of Wardak and Ghazni.   Moscow pledged in a U.N. accord to withdraw all of its more than100,000 combat troops from Afghanistan by Feb. 15. Half were out byAugust and the final pullout in under way.   The Marxist People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan seized powerin a 1978 coup, sparking the Moslem insurrection. Soviet soldiersmarched in a year later to replace one pro-Moscow government withanother, then remained to help it fight the burgeoning civil war.   Negotiations for the accord, signed by Afghanistan, neighboringPakistan, the Soviet Union and the United States, excluded theguerrillas, who say it was their own persistence that forced theSoviets to leave.   The guerrillas, some wearing Soviet-made fur hats and woolenuniform pants captured from fallen government posts, said moralewithin their loose ranks is rising peaking while the morale amongKabul troops is at an ebb.   ``They are very nervous,'' says Wardak. With the Soviets pullingout of the country ``they can't imagine what will happen to them.''   The guerrillas have promised amnesty to defecting troops.   ``If the Soviets really leave, regime forces will fall down ontheir own,'' said Wardak. ``If they really take their hands off ofAfghanistan then the (fighting) can be finished in a short time.''   In the eastern Afghan city of Ghazni, about 100 miles from thePakistan border, guerrillas divided into small cells of 15 havebreached the government's security belt and are inside the citylimits.   About 2,000 government troops are posted in more than 130positions in and around Ghazni. Guerrillas say half are from theranks of Kabul's elite Tsarandoy police and half from the Khad statesecurity force.   Until the Soviets pulled out of the city of 100,000 last year,guerrilla access to it was severely curtailed by Red Army troops whostalked the perimeter and ambushed squads.   ``When the Russians were in Ghazni, every day there was anambush,'' said Abdul Raqib, a commander in the city. But he saidcommunist troops stay within the confines of their posts whenreturning fire.   A handful of guerrillas, one wearing a captured Soviet-issuedtank helmet, moved within the Ghazni city limits to within severalhundred feet of its ancient Balahisar Fort, which seems inpregnablefrom its perch overlooking the city.   The guerrillas harass troops in the bastion with 82mm rockets.   ``We don't expect to capture the fort, we just want to keep thegovernment off guard,'' said Raqib. Within minutes, a tank rumblesout and indiscriminately blasts away in the direction of theguerrillas' fire.   He said the only time the troops venture out is when the fort isattacked, and only then in tanks.   Since the Red Army began withdrawing, government posts in thecountryside began falling to guerrillas. The insurgents now movefreely from neighboring Pakistan, where much of their weapons andammunition originate.   Obscure villages with names like Loghari, Bandi Sadr and Ya Khielare memorials to Soviet-Afghan war dead and testimonials toguerrilla tenacity.   Rusting Soviet-made T-62 tanks and military vehicles arepartially buried in the snow outside Bandi Sadr. In Ya Khiel,guerrillas with rocket-propelled grenade launchers slung over theirshoulders climb over the remains of a Soviet-made helicopter.   The guerrillas want the major cities to collapse from within.   ``We have adopted this strategy because the civilians are afraidof (retaliatory Soviet) bombing raids,'' he said.   Because of this, he said, the cities will stay in communist handsuntil the snow melts away and the last of the Red Army has gone home.</TEXT></DOC>
