Its trackers figure that American adults have $18 billion in their pockets and around the house. But that is only about 12% of the bills and loose change they can't directly account for.    It seems unlikely to the Fed that American children would hide $135.9 billion from their parents. Businesses wouldn't keep so much in the till. The money must be someplace. So where to look?    You could start with Poland.    On a cold Warsaw morning, truckers have unloaded a shipment of kitchen sinks from Spain and stacked them inside the doorway of the state housewares shop on Rozana Street. The customers have spotted them now.    From the bathroom display at the end of the room they move past the Belgian wood-grained linoleum ($9 a meter), the Portuguese cork tiles ($11.40 a pack), the French microwave ovens ($335) and the Polish cast-iron radiators ($45) -- and pounce.    &quot;Impossible to get,&quot; says a woman in a sheepskin coat as she squeezes up to the counter to grab her invoice. At $48.20, the sinks are some buy. She joins the crush at the cash booth, counts out $50 and gets $1.80 in change.    &quot;American money,&quot; she says. &quot;But not America.&quot;    Sure. Yet dollar bills fly around Poland like snowflakes in winter. The slang brims with words for them: When a Pole opens his wallet, a few &quot;greens&quot; will probably peek out; almost anyone can get some &quot;lettuce&quot; should the need arise. Nobody counts, but those who guess put the total of U.S. cash here at $5 billion and up.    Although Poland's Communist leaders hold America in low esteem, they are delighted that their citizens treasure at least as many pictures of Lincoln as they do of Lenin. The government is so taken with dollars that it prints its own: little dollar substitutes, in American denominations, stamped all over with dollar signs.    These bills form part of an apparatus -- known as &quot;internal export&quot; -- through which the government separates the people from their lettuce. Internal export, a Polish journalist writes, &quot;is one of the most beautiful flowers of our newspeak.&quot; It means that the state officially sells hard-to-get items to the public for American money.    The hard-to-get category takes in pistachio nuts, tennis balls, sconces, chain saws, tombstones and kitchen sinks. Hewing to the state's example, ordinary people also repair washing machines privately for dollars, install bathrooms for dollars, and sell each other Russian caviar and Japanese computers for dollars.    The Poles, who have a joke for everything, have a joke about internal export. &quot;In what way,&quot; it goes, &quot;are Poland and America exactly the same?&quot; Answer: &quot;In America, you can buy everything for dollars and nothing for zlotys. In Poland, exactly the same.&quot;    As foreign currencies go, the dollar is less than foreign to quite a few countries. The Fed's accountants would have trouble in Israel finding a mattress that wasn't stuffed with dollars. In Liberia, the dollar has been the local legal tender for 44 years. But in the annals of foreign exchange, Poland merits a chapter of its own.    While their Soviet mentors look upon alien currency as a corrupt influence, the Polish authorities not only let a dollar economy thrive alongside their own -- they operate it. On the black market, the dollar is one commodity that Poles willingly do buy for zlotys. As the dollar falls practically everywhere else, Poles are incredulous; here, it goes up and up.    Nobody in Poland likes spending a foreign country's bills at home. You can't imbue a child with pride in Boleslaus the Brave, as the newspaper Polityka says, when the local currency won't buy a box of Lego. But Poles face facts: A year's export earnings cover just a fifth of a $31 billion debt, and the West won't take zlotys. By tapping the nation's greens, the state pays the debt and meets the Lego demand at the same time.    &quot;We have financial problems and you know it,&quot; an official says. &quot;So why not make good business? If people have dollars, it is better they buy from the state than from private people who get rich making black business. To lose this money would be too stupid.&quot;    Poland has a lot of American dollars mainly because America has a lot of Poles. Polish-Americans have sent cash to Poland for so long that old silver certificates turn up here all the time. The American Embassy still hands out short-stay visas to 60,000 Poles a year; many stay on illegally, work, and bring home the lettuce.    For Poles, the dollar has always been as good as gold. It doesn't wilt in foul political climates. Polish governments feel the same. They have worked to get hold of those dollars since 1929. That was the year Bank PKO, the official foreign-currency bank, opened its Paris office. The Tel Aviv office opened in 1931, Buenos Aires in 1932, New York in 1938. Wherever a Pole keeps a stash, Bank Polska Kasa Opieki opens an office.    Unlike any bank in any other East-bloc country, Bank PKO gives citizens the chance to keep local accounts in foreign currency. That's where those little dollar substitutes, called coupons, come in. The bank prints them, and Poles freely buy and sell them. Each coupon stands for U.S. cash in the bank's vaults. A client who withdraws coupons instead of his own dollars collects more interest. But he will never see his dollars again. The bank has them for good.    In 1981, when the army imposed martial law, the bank put a hold on dollar withdrawals and issued nothing but coupons. This caused what bankers call a &quot;loss of confidence.&quot; Deposits dried up. To lure them back, the bank let anyone put dollars into high-interest accounts, no questions asked, up until March 31, 1985. It didn't matter if the money came from the black market, from smuggling, from prostitution. The bank would take it all.    &quot;They rushed to pay in,&quot; says a Bank PKO manager, Czeslaw Furs. &quot;We had massive inflows.&quot; It seems depositors were delighted with the innovation: an official laundry service.    Yet Poles have always worried that the bank will somehow take them to the cleaners. Most don't deposit dollars; they spend them. So, about 25 years ago, Bank PKO invented internal export.    The bank went West, bought coveted goods wholesale and sold them to Poles at home for dollars. In 1974, it set up a mail-order house called Pewex. Instead of buying from the Sears catalog, Poles now buy from the Pewex catalog. It runs 218 pages and lists 10,000 items, including Atari personal computers, Panasonic video cameras, Moulinex food processors, and any spare part for any Audi, Ford, Mercedes, Opel or Volkswagen built after 1975. Plus Mars Bars.    Quickly, Pewex grew. Sales last year reached $356 million, and more than $120 million went into the government's strongbox. Now Pewex runs 650 shops all over Poland. Warsaw has the housewares Pewex, a sports Pewex, a Lego Pewex. The street outside the Wrangler Pewex is East European gray. The floors inside are bright yellow, the walls dark blue, the counters dark blue, the shelves bright yellow. Everything is Western except the prices; jeans sell for $14.50.    &quot;We give better deals,&quot; says Bogdan Kontecki, the Pewex textile manager. He works at Pewex headquarters on the 30th floor of a Warsaw skyscraper where Western salesmen congregate, sample cases in hand. &quot;Most important, we are giving one-year guarantee for all articles. It is not our business to ask, 'Where is your money coming from?' You are welcome. Spend dollars, please.&quot;    Poland is short of coal and cement, but a Pole with dollars can buy both at Pewex. Another company, Polmot, sells Polish cars for dollars. A Pole without dollars waits years. He will wait for a place to live, too, though an agency called Locum will sell him an apartment for dollars tomorrow.    Nobody thinks this is fair. &quot;The normal worker who has no chance to earn dollars is furious,&quot; says Witold Trzeciakowski, an economist who once advised the outlawed union Solidarity. At its peak, Solidarity talked Pewex into pulling some Polish-made products out of its catalog. Many have crept back. But if normal workers resented it then, they don't resent it much now.    The Polish toilet, to choose an example, comes in four models. The housewares Pewex has them all, displayed against a photographic backdrop of snowy mountains. The biggest state housewares depot, in a dirty shed across the Vistula, stocks one model. On a sleety day, two sad-looking men pace around the pile of white porcelain.    &quot;Warsaw style,&quot; says one. &quot;Impossible to hook up.&quot;    &quot;We need Poznan style,&quot; says the other. Pewex has it, but the two men don't have the dollars. &quot;Pewex we can't manage. But if somebody else can, why not?&quot;    His friend walks out into the sleet. &quot;If other people have dollars to spend,&quot; he says, &quot;let them. They deserve Poznan style.&quot;    The men have two options. A Poznan style could turn up in a private market, among the surfboards and Barbie Dolls. Or they might give in and go shopping for dollars. The government won't sell them any at the official rate. That is illegal. Still, dollar shopping is easy.    Outside any hotel in town, respectable-looking men trade dollars for zlotys, and vice versa. The classified pages of Polish newspapers are full of ads placed by people who want to deal in coupons, but &quot;coupons&quot; is a code word; they will deal in dollars, too. And if answering an ad seems risky, a Pole could turn to this nice young man in a solid-gray business suit and sober-blue tie.    &quot;I have a normal job as a clerk in a state industry,&quot; he says over tea one night. He also has a sideline: &quot;I have 10 people below me. They specialize in private contacts.&quot; And he has people above him. &quot;You start with capital, and that can't be a small amount,&quot; he says. &quot;The owners of the organization have it.&quot;    His organization, the young man says, employs 10 middlemen like him. Each has 10 to 20 traders in the field, and each trader handles a turnover of $100,000 a month. That adds up to around $15 million, and the young man says Warsaw alone has five more rings like his.    How do they know the black-market exchange rate? A hint comes from the hat-check clerk at the Europejski Hotel. He lays a coat across the counter. An American fishes in his pocket for a tip and pulls out a quarter. Will the hatcheck clerk take it?    &quot;Of course,&quot; he says, whisking up the coin. &quot;Three more of these and I'll have half a liter.&quot;    He is talking about vodka. A run though the Pewex catalog discloses something odd about the price of vodka: A half-liter costs precisely $1. It has cost $1 for nine years.    In ordinary shops the price of vodka moves up and down, in zlotys. It tends to fall in summer, when tourists flood the country with dollars. It rises in autumn, when farmers are flush with zlotys. But whatever the season, the price of a half-liter in these shops roughly equals the dollar's value on the black market.    The state sets the official rate, currently 200 zlotys to the dollar. It sets the price of vodka, now about 800 zlotys. The state doesn't run the black market, of course. But its police don't break the big rings, either. They seem content to let the Poles trade their lettuce. Sooner or later, Pewex will get most of it anyway. </TEXT></DOC>
