Justice also requires thatthe rights and losses of the innocent victim be duly vindicated.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">For too long, our criminal justice system focused on the rights ofoffenders and paid little or no attention to the rights and need of thosevictims who suffered physically, emotionally, and financially. However,the 1982 President's Task Force on Victims of Crime focused national attentionon the numerous inequities in the system. Since then, the Federal Governmenthas been working hard with the States to encourage the development andexpansion of programs for crime victims. Last October, the Victims of CrimeAct of 1984, which established a Crime Victims Fund in the U.S. Treasurythat is financed by penalty assessments on all convicted Federal defendants,was reauthorized for 6 more years. Cooperative efforts at all levels ofgovernment will continue in order to improve responsiveness to the needsof crime victims.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">This Administration is committed to maintaining the essential supportsystem for victims and is determined to find additional ways to providetimely restitution to victims and to help them recover from the traumaof victimization. Federal and State dollars alone cannot do the job. Socialservice agencies, schools, hospitals, businesses, churches, and privatecitizens play a vital role in assisting victims of crime, and we must continueto support their efforts. Now more than ever, we need to enlist volunteers.I have spoken of a thousand points of light_of all the community organizationsthat are spread like stars throughout the Nation, doing good. We must ensurethat those groups who offer the bright promise of hope and healing to crimevictims continue to thrive. We must ensure that crime victims receive ourspecial attention and that the combined efforts of concerned citizens,lawmakers, and criminal justice personnel help to improve and expand servicesfor them.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE BUSH, President of the United States ofAmerica, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution andlaws of the United States, do hereby proclaim the week beginning April9, 1989, as Crime Victims Week. As we rededicate ourselves to respondingwith speed and sensitivity to the needs of innocent crime victims, we mustalso resolve to educate our citizens about ways to minimize the risk ofvictimization. As always, we must rely on the courage and generosity ofthe American people in fighting crime and alleviating the suffering itcauses. This week, we have an opportunity to express our gratitude to thosewho have worked tirelessly to meet the needs of innocent crime victimsand their families. I urge all Americans to continue to show compassionfor the victims of crime, as well as apppreciation for those who work forjustice.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twelfth day ofApril, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-nine, and ofthe Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirteenth.<ITAG tagnum="65">andPres;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">[FR Doc. 89-9220</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Filed 4-13-89; 11:55 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="50">Billing Code 3195-01-M</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><ITAG tagnum="44">Crime Victims Week, 1989</ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
