But one thing I know: Life is an adventure. You've gotto hold on and let it carry you away.&quot;   Ron Koslow -- creator of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; -- isback, and once again he's jerking tears. This time, it's thetears of future past. Set in the year 2035, his new series,&quot;My Life and Times&quot; (ABC, Wednesdays, 9:30 p.m. EDT), talksof birthing tanks and oil wars, the millenium, the Collapseand the New York Dodgers, but you couldn't really say it'sscience fiction. That's because it's not about lookingforward; it's about looking back.</LP><TEXT>   At the center of &quot;My Life and Times&quot; is Ben Miller, an85-year-old man with a fondness for reminiscing. As friends,relatives and attendants wander through Parkview, his old-agecommunity, he pulls them over and tells them tales. In fact,like Coleridge's ancient mariner, he'll collar just aboutanyone within earshot, and before you can say &quot;unhand me,greybeard loon,&quot; he's off and running.   It's actually not an unappealing premise for a show -- aninveterate storyteller looking back over his life, with eachweek's tale told in an extended flashback. Take this week'sepisode, &quot;Jessie.&quot;   One of the female residents at Parkview is about to beshipped off to a nursing home. Ben intervenes, and staring atthis wrinkled woman, recalls a passionate affair they hadover a July 4th weekend in 1978 -- a chance encounter, a dashto the Metropolitan Museum, an afternoon delight, and anevening on a terrace reciting Rilke with fireworks going offbehind them.   Ben thought this would be the love of his life. But thenext day, Jessie disappeared. Over the years, they would meetby chance, only to end up together in this senior citizens'home after so many decades. Unabashedly sentimental as it is,with its &quot;September Song&quot; feeling, &quot;Jessie&quot; may be the bestof all the episodes because it's bittersweet -- full ofunrequited passion, missed connections and lostopportunities. And never does it patronize the elderly.   Next week's episode, &quot;The Wedding,&quot; reveals Mr. Koslow'sformula most clearly. An attendant comes in to tell Ben thatshe's getting married. Of course, he's full of advice: &quot;Don'tlet what happened to Rebecca and me happen to you.&quot; And justas surely, he has a tale to recount: &quot;Did I ever tell youabout what happened . . .&quot; We dissolve into the past.   A wedding is in the works. Ben and Rebecca's wedding.Slowly but surely, the parents' idea of what the ceremonyshould be, and the tension of organizing the big event,conspire to make them miserable, to make them fight, to makethem split up. Ben storms off to catch a bus back to NewYork, only to hear an old man in the waiting room lecture himon true love. Ben and Rebecca have a tearful reunion. Thenext day, they do the ceremony their way, and it's beautiful.Cut to Parkview. &quot;Oh Mr. Miller,&quot; sniffles one of theattendants. &quot;It was just so romantic.&quot;   That's Ron Koslow for you -- the schmaltz man. Theschmaltzmeister. Mr. Schmaltz-o-rama. Say what you will, theman knows how to sell Kleenex.   As Ben Miller, actor Tom Irwin does a star turn, rangingin age from his 20s through 30s, 40s, 50s, up to 85. He's alovable old windbag of a character, but it's unfortunate thatthe writers feel the need to slap morals on all theirstories: a grandson is distraught because he didn't get intoPrinceton. Ben tells him a story that ends, &quot;Sometimes youhave to let go of your plans. Sometimes life has a betterplan. You have to let life pick you up and carry you away . ..&quot; The boy smiles. Everything's OK. &quot;Thanks Grandpa,&quot; hesays.   Another week, it's his son who's having money problems atthe business. Cut to a story about the 1980s, when &quot;the citywas one big casino.&quot; After a tale-full of insider tradingcomes the moral: &quot;I was blinded to everything but the money,till your mother kicked me in the butt . . . It's OK to getlost, to lose yourself, but you don't have to get lostalone.&quot; His son smiles. Everything's OK. &quot;Thanks Dad,&quot; hesays.   Other wisdom includes: &quot;Get up. Face the day. Try to be asgrateful as hell you're alive to do that,&quot; and &quot;Have somefaith in the future, but don't forget the past.&quot;   Fortune cookies aside, &quot;My Life and Times&quot; does have someimportant redeeming features. Most interestingly, it's ahalfhour drama, a form friends of mine in the TV businessassured me could never exist. But they're wrong, wrong,wrong. This is a great format for the telling of shortstories, and when &quot;My Life and Times&quot; succeeds, as in thisweek's episode, it succeeds as a short story would: It's asmall window on time, a brief glimpse at a passing moment.   Because of the show's concept, &quot;My Life and Times&quot; is notstuck like a sitcom in one living room or one workplace.Unified by a central character, it can shift radically intone and decade from week to week, veering from Ben'sromances to his struggles through a great depression, fromthe time he panicked when his son got lost to the time he wasworking on a newspaper, covering a series of murders. Best ofall, they're all adult topics.   It's unfortunate when the treatment gets so heartfelt andsoggy, because the show's writers certainly know how to spina yarn. And as Coleridge, another romantic, knew, a realstoryteller has a way of mesmerizing his audience. PerhapsMr. Koslow will be able to stop one in three like the ancientmariner. That should add up to some pretty impressive Nielsenratings.   But if they really want some great stories, they ought toget in touch with my grandmother.</TEXT></DOC>
