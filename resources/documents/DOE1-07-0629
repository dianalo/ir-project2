Impact bending, tensile and bolt tensile-cross-threadingtests are carried out for specimens with a ring-notch. It is shown thatthe presence of plastic surface layer produced by the HFC tempering essentiallydecreases notch sensitivity of hardened 40KhN steel, optimal depth oftempering depending on the notch and specimen diameter as well as onthe type of loading.</TEXT></DOC>
