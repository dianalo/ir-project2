Winter 1989, 550 megabytes.andP;  Copy Protection: NoneandM;Sure, I'll review three CD-ROMs full of software, I tell my editor.andP;  When Iget the discs home and look at what I have to do, I suffer a head crash.andP;  Notthe disc drive head--my head, coming into contact with my keyboard.andM;The three CD-ROMs contain nearly a gigabyte of software in about 20,000files.andP;  Rather than run every program, I decide that my only hope is toevaluate the three disc on the basis of weight and packaging--in terms of theamount and kind of software collected and of the usefulness of thecollection's organization, that is.andP;  I soon discover that organization isvery important, since running the Find File desk accessory on a CD-ROM isabout as much fun as indexing the Library of Congress on 3 x 5 cards.andM;The three CD-ROM disc are The BMUG (Berkeley Macintosh Users Group) PD ROM(published by Discovery Systems), Educorp's CD ROM, and Quantum Access'ClubMac.andM;BMUG says the PD in PD ROM stands for publicly distributable.andP;  Its disc is acollection of nearly 300 megabytes of shareware, public-domain software, anddemoware, including more than 20 megabytes of electronic messages downloadedfrom Macintosh forums on several electronic networks.andP;  It's organized bycategory: business, education, games, fonts, Mac II-specific products, and soforth.andM;The philosophy behind Educorp's disc is similar to BMUG's.andP;  The Educorp CDROM also contains about 300 megabytes, but without messages, meaning there'sabout ten percent more shareware, public-domain software, and demoware,similarly organized by category.andP;  Version 2.0 of Educorp's disc, containingapproximately 550 megabytes of information, should be available by the timeyou read this.andM;The ClubMac disc os the most ambitious in organization and concept.andP;  &quot;ClubMacis a cross between a magazine, a bulletin board, and a software distributioncenter,&quot; according to Quantum.andP;  The first volume, Fall 1988, has more than400 megabytes of public-domain software, shareware, demoware, and electronicmessages, plus features supporting the magazine/bulletin-board concept.andP;  Thesecond, Winter 1989, contains more than 550 megabytes.andM;There is a significant overlap among the programs on these three disc--ashigh as 90 percent in some categories, by my estimation--but the raw size ofthe overlap doesn't tell the whole story.andP;  For example, each disc has theresource editor ResEdit, but each has a different version of the often-reviedutility (BMUG's disc has the most recent).andP;  (As I sketch what's on the discs,I'm hitting only the highlights; each disc has cdevs and INITs, for example.)andO;Beyond the overlap, there are some clear-cut differences in content.andP;  Thereare also significant differences in the discs' organization and in thescreening of the software.andM;BMUG's PD ROM has 500 fonts organized into display, PostScript, laser,picture, and foreign-language fonts, plus font utilities.andP;  There are severaldozen Excel templates, the 726K demo version of 4th Dimension along with manyexamples, about 70K of HyperCard stacks, more programming tools than theother discs, and surprisingly little music (but good sound utilities).andO;Everything on the disc runs under System Release 5.0 on a Mac SE or Plus,except for the files explicitly designated for the Mac II familyandM;Its electronic messages are judiciously selected and include the Arts andamp;Farces newsletter and digests from Delphi, EchoMac, and USEnet.andP;  Notsurprisingly, this is the only disc with a complete set of BMUG newsletters.andO;Good stuff.andM;The hierarchical organization of the BMUG disc generally runs three or fourlevels deep.andP;  So, for example, you'll find the program Parametric Statistics2.0 in the Statistics/Data Analysis folder within the Mathematics folderwithin the Education folder.andP;  There are 20 top-level folders.andP;  Generally, Ifind the organization intuitive, but I occasionally need help to find files.andO;(Are text utilities filed under text or utilities?)andP;  Fortunately, the diskhas several helpful indexing tools.andM;BMUG provides a range of support services to members, including a technicalhelp line, an electronic bulletin board, and a subscription to itsnewsletter.andP;  (Buying the PD ROM doesn't confer membership in BMUG, though.)andO;Only the BMUG disc contains written documentation, an eight-page insertcomparable to those in music CDs.andM;The Educorp disc has a complete electronic bulletin-board system and moremusic than the BMUG disc.andP;  It has more than 100K of stacks but does notinclude HyperCard or the 4th Dimension demo.andP;  Comprising only software, withno down-loaded messages, it has roughly ten percent more programs than theBMUG disc.andM;At the top level, the Educorp disc is organized into 23 categories, such asbusiness, education, fonts, and Mac II-specific files.andP;  The breakdown at thesecond level is mostly by volume number (which appears to mean Educorp'sacquisition date), and the next level (if any) is again by category.andP;  Thevolume numbers are useless here.andM;One nice feature is a liberal use of self-running documentation files thattell how to use or install certain categories of files, such as laser fonts,but it lacks good navigation or indexing tools for finding things on thedisc.andM;Printed on the face of the Educorp disc is a cagey disclaimer regarding thescreening and selection of software on the disc.andP;  The disc is &quot;a chronicle ofMacintosh public domain andamp; shareware software development.&quot;andP;  In other words,some of this stuff is of historical value only and won't run on currentsystems.andP;  Educorp presents a frank explanation of this potential problem andsuggests some things to do about it.andM;The first ClubMac disc has a lot of font utilities and about 500 fonts.andO;There are 450 desk accessories, 95 sounds, 250 snippets of music, 20 editors,scores of word-processing utilities, 12 cdevs, 12 startup screens, 8 rdevs,55 Fkeys, and 64 INITs.andP;  There are spreadsheet templates and 80 megabytes ofstacks.andP;  Quantum has included the full HyberCard version 1.2 and full AppleSystem versions 5.0 and 6.0.andP;  The second disc has this much and more.andM;I find it pretentious to call downloaded messages &quot;articles&quot; and &quot;reviews.&quot;andO;They include company press releases (including Quantum's); an obsolete(pre-HyperCard) list of &quot;current&quot; version numbers of software compiled bySteve Bobker for this magazine; and ny own favorite, &quot;a note from Frank toChris, which is basically about fonts.&quot;andM;The ClubMac editors intend for the disc to be distributed quarterly and haveput many services on the disc in addition to the software.andP;  It includes auser-rating system for products, a section for classified ads, and many ofthe forum features of an electronic bulletin board -- and Quantum does notcharge users for participation.andP;  Users can dial up Quantum's real electronicbulletin board to upload their contributions or request technical support.andO;The BBS is intended to be an online extension of the disc -- an interestingidea, but there are problems in the execution.andM;The first ClubMac disc was handicapped by illiteracy, which affected theusefulness of the disc: it's remarkably hard to search for anything bykeyword when breadboard is spelled as two words, aperture is spelled&quot;appeture,&quot; floppies is spelled &quot;floppies,&quot; and circuit is spelled &quot;cirquit.&quot;andO;Quantum has not cleaned up the spelling for the second disc, but theorganization is significantly improved, so it's not as critical to be able tosearch by keyword.andM;The organization of a CD-ROM compendium affects both the ease of finding afile on the disc and the access speed.andP;  In informal testing, I found iteasiest to locate a file on the BMUG disc.andP;  When it comes to accessing afile, the BMUG disc is generally fastest, and the ClubMac discs are the bestslowest.andP;  When you're examining a gigabyte of software, you care about accessspeed.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
