Electra, one of Britain's biggest and most consistently successful investment companies, said it would join with seven international institutions to form a #365 million ($593.7 million) fund that would invest in management buy-outs, restructurings and joint ventures involving closely held European companies.    And in an admitted effort to recruit and retain key investment managers in a sharply competitive job market, Electra said it would sell its investment management unit to a newly formed company 20%-owned by Electra's management team, which would pay #750,000 for the stake. The new company, Kingsway Managers Holdings Ltd., would manage Electra's world-wide venture-capital portfolio, as well as the new fund, which has a designated maximum of #550 million.    Both measures will be submitted for shareholder approval at a special meeting scheduled for Sept. 13.    Michael Bentley, Electra's deputy chairman and chief executive officer, and Michael Stoddart, chairman, said in interviews that the Kingsway arrangement is designed to raise fund managers' compensation by giving them a performance-based piece of the action. &quot;We are rewarding executives by making them partners in the management company&quot; at a time of fierce competition for people with free-spending U.S. and British investment banks, Mr. Stoddart said.    Electra would own 49.9% of the new management company. It also would have a performance-based compensation scheme that, Electra indicated to analysts, could sharply boost Electra's earnings. The remaining 30.1% of Kingsway would be bought by five of the international investors for a total of #3.25 million.    In late dealings on London's stock exchange, Electra shares traded at 340 pence ($5.53), up 22 pence from Tuesday's close. Under the plan, &quot;Electra would have much more funds under management and would completely change the perspective of the management company,&quot; said Colin Kingsnorth, an analyst with Olliff andamp; Partners, a securities firm. He added, &quot;Their ability to attract top people in the City {London's financial district} has improved.&quot;    According to Mr. Kingsnorth, at a meeting with analysts yesterday, Electra executives said that had the new plan been in place, after-tax earnings for the 12 months ended last March 31 would have been #10.5 million, or 57% more than posted earnings of #6.7 million.    Electra would contribute #200 million to the new #365 million fund. The largest of the other seven investors would be the pension fund of General Electric Co. of Fairfield, Conn., with a #35 million stake, Mr. Bentley said.    The other investors would be Credit Commercial de France, Globe Investment Trust, Industrial Bank of Japan, Government of Singapore Investment Corp., U.S. Steel andamp; Carnegie Pension Fund and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.    Mr. Stoddart indicated that the fund would be wary of investing in leveraged buy-outs. &quot;The market for LBOs is getting tough,&quot; because of high interest rates, share prices and inflation, he said. </TEXT></DOC>
