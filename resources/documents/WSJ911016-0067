The chairman and a director bought stock in theDallas-based hospital management chain for the first time,spending $546,975 on a total of 56,100 shares, the filingsshow. Their purchases came on top of private purchasestotaling 9.4 million shares by the company's largestshareholders, leveraged buy-out fund Harry Gray, Mel Klein andamp;Partners, and First Boston Corp., according to the filings.</LP><TEXT>   The officials' purchases were part of American Medical'sAugust public offering of 16.2 million common shares at $9.75each. At the same time, American Medical privately placed 4.3million shares with Harry Gray, Mel Klein and 5.1 millionshares with First Boston, all at $9.75 a share.   In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,the stock closed at $9.50 a share, up 25 cents.   Why all this insider buying at a company that has $1.7billion of debt, most of it at double-digit interest rates?   Geoffrey Harris, analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp;Co., says Wall Street investors have let American Medical'sdebt load scare them off from a turnaround situation.   &quot;They've got profitable hospitals, the equity offeringbrought the debt-to-capital ratio to 75% from 90%&quot; and, atthe end of this month, the company will report its firstoperating profits since 1989, he predicts. &quot;It's significantthat the LBO investors came in at the market price&quot; and otherinvestors may be able to &quot;ride their coattails.&quot;   Wendy Simpson, chief financial officer of AmericanMedical, says funds raised from the stock offerings and froma recent junk-bond issue went to repay a $450 million bridgeloan from First Boston. That and other measures have savedthe company $60 million in annual interest costs, she said.The company is projecting another $100 million in savingsover the next three to five years because of cost-cuttingmeasures, she added.   Robert O'Leary, American Medical's chairman, purchased41,100 shares, SEC filings show. The $400,725 purchase wasMr. O'Leary's first since becoming chairman of the hospitalchain in July, according to the filings. A director of thecompany, William E. Mayer, bought 15,000 shares, SEC filingsshow.   Mr. O'Leary declined to comment. Mr. Mayer couldn't bereached for comment.   American Medical Holdings was formed in 1989 by HarryGray, Mel Klein and First Boston Investments, to acquireAmerican Medical International Inc. Mr. Gray is a formerchairman of American Medical.   ---   POWER BUYING: Four insiders at Nevada Power Co., a LasVegas utility, nibbled at the company's stock in purchasesfrom July 1 through Sept. 5, SEC filings show.   Altogether, they purchased 6,628 shares at an averageprice of $18 a share, for a total of $119,304, according tothe filings.

That turned out to be near the higher end of the$10.25-to-$25.25 trading range for the stock during the pastsix months, as the company's share price seesawed with theoutlook for a $1.4 billion government contract pending forthe computer company and American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co.   In July, Pyramid won the government contract, but theaward was challenged by International Business Machines Corp.Last month, a government contract appeals board blocked theaward, pending Treasury action, contending that the Treasuryhadn't adequately explained why it chose ATandamp;T's bid over alower-priced competitor's.   At the time of the sales, &quot;there was no way for us to knowthat we would have won the contract&quot; or that the IBM &quot;protestwould be upheld,&quot; said a Pyramid spokesman. The insidersales, he said, were related to a change in SECinsider-trading rules, taking effect May 1, that make iteasier for insiders to exercise options and sell sharesimmediately.   They sold a total of 240,568 shares, SEC filings show.Several of them exercised options, at prices of about $14 ashare, and sold those shares simultaneously, leavingthemselves with no Pyramid Technology stockholdings, SECfilings show, although some retain options.   Yesterday, Pyramid Technology stock rose $1.50 to close at$16.75 in national over-the-counter trading.</TEXT></DOC>
