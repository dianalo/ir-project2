The tax law will also significantly increase the taxes of the average person over the age of 65, the study concludes.    The new figures differ sharply from official estimates put out by the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, which indicate that average taxpayers in every income category will receive a tax cut.    The congressional estimates ignore the effects of the increase in corporate taxes, and look only at the change in individual income taxes. But the numbers prepared by Mr. Feldstein, former chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, reflect an attempt to determine who pays the increased corporate tax, an effort he admits is filled with pitfalls.    Because high-income taxpayers and the elderly hold a large share of the nation's corporate stock, his study shows that a disproportionate amount of the corporate tax increase affects them. Mr. Feldstein's figures are for 1988, and assume that the changes contained in the tax legislation have been fully phased in.    Mr. Feldstein's finding that the new tax law places a heavy burden on high-income Americans is similar to results obtained by other researchers. Joseph Pechman of the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank, for instance, found that taxpayers in the top 10% of the nation's income distribution scale would pay more taxes under the new law, while the other 90% would pay less.    Perhaps the most surprising result of Mr. Feldstein's work, however, is the large tax increase on the elderly resulting from the 1986 tax law. According to his study, taxpayers over the age of 65 would see their individual and corporate tax burden rise 12% under the new law. </TEXT></DOC>
