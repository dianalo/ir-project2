 In this agreement, an estimate is made of simultaneoususers of a software package on a network.andP;  If the guess is toolow, however, some prospective users may be locked out because thelicense is only for a set number, and if the guess is too high,licenses are purchased that remain unused.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     LicensingLocal Area NetworksSoftware packagesMarketing StrategyCompaniesSoftware Publishers.andO;Feature:   illustrationphotograph.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>A lack of consistency among PC software suppliers threatens  to undermine theexplosive growth of local area networks.andP;  No two licensing options are alike,and customers feel bogged down by the fine print.andM;One of the more complex questions facing big corporate managers of local areanetworks is the unresolved matter of network licensing for PC-based softwareapplications.andP;  Large companies are clamoring for consistency in the waysoftware vendors dispense those licensing agreements.andP;  Meanwhile, softwarepublishers are trying to protect their intellectual property and make a fairprofit.andP;  The result has been a variety of sometimes confusing licensingagreements, ranging from the very conservative individual license-one licensefor every user-to the far more liberal site license-one license per site-withvariations in between.andM;&quot;Everyone has a different approach to licensing, whether it's on the networkor stand-alone boxes,&quot; says Russell Gates, partner of the Chicago-basedconsulting firm Arthur Andersen andamp; Co.andM;Many large software vendors consider site licensing, which usually amounts toa volume discount, to be bad business.andP;  WordPerfect Corp. of Orem, Utah, forexample, says it wants nothing to do with an agreement that basically allowscustomers to make unlimited  copies of its software.andP;  &quot; It's unreasonable fora vendor to be expected to offer customers unlimited use of a product, evenfor a fee,&quot; says WordPerfect's Ross Wolfley, director of channel marketing.andO;Site LicensingandM;WordPerfect says it stopped offering volume purchase agreements for bigcustomers two years ago.andP;  Now customers may purchase either single copies,five-packs or 20-packs, and they must obtain the corresponding number oflicenses whether they buy 10 or 10,000 copies.andM;Other large software manufacturers, such as Microsoft Corp. of Redmond,Wash., and Cambridge, Mass.-based Lotus Development Corp., are equallyopposed to site licensing.andP;  They say they don't want to be bogged down innegotiating tricky licensing agreements and would prefer to avoid situationsthat result in the appearance of preferential treatment of some of theircustomers.andM;Computer Associates International Inc. is one software vendor that is morefavorably disposed toward site licensing agreements and its variations.andP;  Forone thin  site licensing harks back to the Garden  City, N.Y., company'sroots in the mainframe software industry, where the practice is more common.andO;But there's another reason for CA's tolerance of site licensing.andP;  Although abig software company overall, CA is a relatively small competitor in the PCsoftware marketplace.andP;  Site licensing gives CA a competitive edge against thelikes of Lotus and Microsoft.andM;A Concurrent AlternativeandM;Somewhere between all-out site licensing and individual licenses is&quot;concurrent licensing.andP;  &quot; This is generally defined as licensing based on thenumber of simultaneous users on a network accessing a piece of software atany given time or at peak times.andP;  Keeping track of these network users is noteasy, say some corporate network managers.andP;  &quot;The fact is, most userorganizations don't know how many people are using what software on thenetworks,&quot; says Cheryl Currid, director of applied information technology atCoca Cola Foods in Houston.andM;It'S not surprising, then, that some vendors resist the notion of concurrentlicensing.andP;  Nevertheless, a number of large software companies, includingAshtonTate Corp. n Torrance, Calif., and Borland International Inc. in ScottsValley, Calif., offer the option and audit corporate accounts to ensurecompliance with the agreements.andM;Bill Fleming, national sales manager for corporate accounts at graphicssoftware designer Micrografx Inc. in Richardson, Texas, thinks thatconcurrent licensing has its advantages.andP;  &quot;I feel the concurrent userpopulation would increase naturally, and the strategy could be an [effective]way to track the number of users of a particular software title,&quot; Flemingsays.andP;  Micrografx works with each corporate account individually and plans toa as flexible as possible with licensing on a case-by-case basis.andM;* You NEED A CRYSTAL BALL To SEE WHO IS USING WHAT ON THE NETWORK.andM;New York City-based Swiss Bank Corp. recently considered concurrent licensingfor its new PC networks but later rejected the idea, says Ron Adinolfi, vicepresident of enterprise decision support-.andP;  &quot;We looked at it, but there wasno counting mechanism or  utility available compatible with os/2 LAN Server,&quot;he says.andP;  Because the number of concurrent users generally varies from day today or week to week, it is difficult to determine exactly how many use s aregoing to need a given application.andP;  You need a crystal ball to see who isusing what on the network, which means you end up offering a best guess,&quot;Adinolfi explains.andM;Guess too low, and some vendors will lock users out from the application oncetheir number climbs above that set in the licensing agreement.andP;  But guess toohigh, and you pay for licenses you aren't using.andP;  &quot;If there was a good enoughcounter to keep track and give me a detailed report on a weekly or monthlybasis, I would have gone that way,&quot; Adinolfi says.andM;Swiss Bank opted simply to buy one license for every possible  network user.andO;&quot;We have a negotiated contract for licenses for every single user, includingwhere there's a possible simultaneous use,&quot; Adinolfi says.andP;  That's onelicense per user although there is only one physical copy of the software.&quot;andM;Swiss Bank's method of counting heads is certainly the easiest way, short ofsite licensing, to determine the number of software licenses required at agiven network installation.andP;  But many vendors report that this method causesconfusion, particularly if every network node isn't using the same packages.andO;Time To NegotiateandM;In the absence of a simple way to determine the true number of individualsusing networked software, many users are negotiating case by case with eachvendor.andP;  &quot;We see the only way to approach the software issue on LANs and WANsis with [specific] partnership agreements with vendors,&quot; says E. G.andO;Lenfestey, manager of computer purchases for American Airlines Inc. in Tulsa,Okla.andP;  The issues on the table include not only how many users should beincluded in the license but also how often those users run the software.andO;Should we have to purchase a copy of software or pay for a software licensefor every network user if that user may only use the product once a year?&quot;andO;Lenfestey asks.andP;  No, he and other users say.andP;  Understangably, vendors findthis to be a thorny issue that directly threatens their revenue base.andM;Still, software vendors are trying to accommodate their customers, at leasttheir largest ones.andP;  Last spring, Microsoft initiated a new program it callsMicrosoft License Paks (MLP).andP;  Under the terms  of the program, a companybuys a full  retail version of a software package complete with softwaredisks and documentation.andP;  It also buys an MLP, which consists of a licenseagreement allowing the, company to make a copy of the package  for apredetermine number of users.andP;  The company is then charged for each copy a20% less than its full retail value.andM;The need for this kind of option ha always been there, says Scott Oki, Microsoft's senior vice president of sales and marketing.andP;  He agrees that moreattention should be paid to the needs of network users.andP;  &quot;They [corporations]are really scrutinizing license agreements more than ever,&quot; Oki says.andM;A Matter of ConsistencyandM;Everyone may agree on the problem, but  the solution does not seem to be insight.andP;  &quot;Nobody knows how to do licensing to the satisifaction of both theusers and guys who make the software,&quot; says Mort Rosenthal, president ofCanton, Mass.-based software distributor Corporate Software Inc. &quot;Customerswill eventually dictate that there be some degree of consistency amongvendors.andP;  But meanwhile, it is difficult to manage software distribution overa network when it relies on an honor system.&quot;andM;Software Publishing Association  spA) executive director Ken Wasch agreesthat the licensing issue has the industry in a state of flux.andP;  &quot;People arediscovering that networking opens up opportunities and creates problems.&quot;andP;  hesays.andP;  &quot;The position of the SPA is whatever licensing mechanism is used, wewould like it to be verifiable.andP;  Users don't always know what's legal andwhat's not legal.&quot; Wasch stresses, however, that a clear majority ofcorporate users want to be legal.andM;For now, anyway, users may find themselves as mired in the fine print oflicensing agreements as they are in managing the technical workings of theirnetworks.andP;  &quot;I almost need someone full-time to administer software licenses,&quot;says Coca Cola's Currid.andP;  Adds Gates of Arthur Andersen: &quot;You do need to becareful with licensing because you don't want it to become an administrativeburden.andM;How Lotus Keeps You HonestandM;Lotus Development Corp., the Cambridge, Mass.-based software giant, ispursuing a form of concurrent use licensing that  many PC managers findconfusing.andP;  Others say that its method of selling Lotus  1-2-3 in threeretail versions-a standedition-is alone edition, a server edition and a nodeedition--is  perhaps the most equitable licensing in scheme to date.andP;  Thecompany defends its system as one that saves users money during periods ofpeak use.andM;Lotus's network licensing works like this: if a Lotus customer has a10-person network with five concurrent users, then he or she can buy oneserver edition and four node editions.andP;  This gives the customer one set ofsoftware for the server and a total of five licenses and five sets ofdocumentation that any of 10 persons on the network can use.andP;  With servereditions of releases 2.2 and 3.6, if a sixth user tries to access thesoftware, however, one person gets locked out by a licensing utility.andP;  onlyway a company can get by without the utility is if it can show Lotus that ithas a similar counting mechanism already in place.andM;Users say such network-metering devices, although rare, can be effective.andO;Other popular software programs with a similar counting mechanism include theHarvard Graphics LAN packs available from Mountain View, Calif.-basedSoftware Publishing Corp. and 3 Com Corp.'s 3 + Open network software.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
