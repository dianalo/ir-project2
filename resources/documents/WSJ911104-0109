Does it work at all?   After dogging advertisers for decades, those questionsseemed on the verge of being answered last week. InformationResources Inc. unveiled the results of an exhaustive,six-year test tracking 30,000 households' TV viewing andreading habits and their product purchases. The research firmknew what TV commercials Paxton Blackwell of Williamsport,Pa., watched, for example, as well as the foods he bought,the coupons he used, even what he ate for breakfast.</LP><TEXT>   And what did this $1 million study conclude? &quot;Nothingrevolutionary,&quot; reports Ann Bastianelli, director ofadvertising for DowBrands, a Dow Chemical unit thatparticipated in the study. &quot;It just confirms what we allknow. Period.&quot;   The Information Resources test is part of the new frontierknown as &quot;single source&quot; research. It tracks the TVcommercials consumers see -- and often the ads in magazinesand newspapers they read, as well -- and matches that withwhat the people buy. For advertisers, the research is moreakin to the holy grail: it promises to explain precisely howand when advertising works.   Yet that promise is turning quickly to disappointment.Several of the 20 advertisers involved in the InformationResources study say they were distinctly underwhelmed by itsconclusions, which they deemed broad, obvious anduninstructive. They don't fault Information Resources.Instead, they say, the concept of single-source research hassome fundamental flaws.   &quot;There's less here than meets the eye,&quot; says RichardLightburn, a vice president of ad agency DDB Needham, a studysponsor. &quot;The technology isn't worth the expense.&quot;   Among the research firm's conclusions after years oftesting: There &quot;is no simple correspondence&quot; between moreadvertising and higher sales. Another biggie: new brandsshould be advertised more heavily at their introduction, andthey benefit from more prime-time advertising. Then there'sthis one: New ad copy can help increase sales.   Advertisers say that while the reams of data can show whenads work, it can't usually pinpoint why. The sheer volume ofdata is overwhelming, making it difficult to analyze. Yeteven more information is needed. Most of the research can'ttake radio advertising or billboards into account, and itusually doesn't track purchases from small specialty stores.Innumerable other variables, from pricing to market share,muddy the picture further.   Making matters worse is the high cost. The InformationResources study cost advertisers $25,000 apiece. &quot;That's alot of money for a dud,&quot; concludes George Mahrlig, directorof media services for Campbell Soup Co., a participant.   What Campbell learned from the study was thatsingle-source &quot;doesn't tell you how advertising works,&quot; Mr.Mahrlig says. &quot;Frankly, I don't think that it's going tounlock that for us because the key variable is creative --and single-source can't tell you how to write a commercial.&quot;   The underwhelming response so far is troublesome,considering the ad industry's headlong rush intosingle-source research. Aside from Information Resources,ratings giant A.C. Nielsen and Arbitron both offer their ownversions. Arbitron is expected to formally announce itsScanAmerica program today; it says the service will benationwide by 1993.   But single-source defenders say the research is still inits infancy and that the kinks will be ironed out over time.With the benefit of experience, &quot;we could do a much betterjob of this the second time around,&quot; says Leonard Lodish, aWharton marketing professor who helped analyze theInformation Resources data. The three major networks, all ofwhom participated in the study, also support it.   Many of Information Resources's findings were significant,Mr. Lodish says. And he contends future research will be evenstronger because the firm is expanding its tracking system.It will have nationally projectible TV ratings and purchaseinformation beginning in January; the earlier test couldn'tbe projected nationally.   Even the study concludes that its findings support &quot;commonbeliefs&quot; about such things as the impact of promotions on TVadvertising effectiveness. &quot;There are some aspects of what Icall the `duh' factor,&quot; says Alice K. Sylvester, a seniorvice president of participant J. Walter Thompson.   But she says the study was nevertheless helpful in&quot;confirming some of the things we have suspected.&quot; And, sheadds, it gives new insight into advertising's ability togenerate short-term sales.   There were some intriguing results. The study found thatincreasing ad spending in one year, for example, paid off inincreased sales during years two and three.   The most controversial finding is the study's suggestionthat top-scoring ads in copy tests don't necessarily sellanything. Advertisers' favorite way to measure an ad is bymeasuring consumer recall and persuasion. But the relationbetween high copy test scores and increased sales &quot;is tenuousat best,&quot; the study found.   Thompson's Ms. Sylvester considers that finding to be themost important of all. &quot;A lot of good campaigns have beentossed by the wayside because they didn't pass thecopy-testing norm,&quot; she says. &quot;I hope this liberates ourclients and creative people a little bit.&quot;   Overall, Wharton's Mr. Lodish concedes the study didn'tcome up with much specific advice for advertisers. &quot;There'sstill plenty of art in the process. There's still noformula.&quot; But rather than a setback for single-sourceresource, he sees that as one of its most important findings.   If advertisers &quot;learned that there aren't any micro rulesthat will always work,&quot; he says, &quot;that's an importantlesson.&quot;   ---   Yugo Names Finalists                                                                                                          Yugo America narrowed its search for a new ad agency tothree New York finalists: Lois/GGK, Goldberg Fossa Seid, andKatz Dochtermann andamp; Epstein.   Yugo, controlled by Yugoslavian carmaker Zastava, projectsbillings of $7 million to $9 million next year, aboutone-third of what it spent before its Chapter 11 filing in1989. The incumbent on the account, Frankfurt Gips Balkind,decided against participating in the review, said Tim Stone,Yugo national sales manager. This pitch marks KatzDochtermann andamp; Epstein's debut in a review for a nationalaccount.

IDES: The federal inquiry into ads for St. Ides maltliquor is proceeding too slowly, officials from the New YorkState Consumer Protection Board and the State Division ofAlcoholism and Alcohol Abuse charged.
