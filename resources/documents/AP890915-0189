Years pass, all places and faces fade, some people have died,   And I stand in a far land, the evening still, and am at last sure   That I miss more that stillness at bird-call than some thingsthat were   to fail later.      (From ``Selected Poems 1923-1975,'' published by Random House)</TEXT><NOTE>What Was the Promise That Smiled From the Maples at Evening?</NOTE><TEXT>      What was the promise that smiled from the maples at evening?   Smiling dim from the shadow, recessed? What language of leaf-lip?   And the heels of the fathers click on the concrete, returning,   Each aware of his own unspecified burden, at sun-dip.      In first darkness hydrangeas float white in their spectralprecinct.   Beneath pale hydrangeas the first firefly utters cold burning.   The sun is well down, the first star has now winked....      (From ``Promises,'' in ``Selected Poems 1923-1975,'' published byRandom House)</TEXT><NOTE>From ``Acquaintance With Time in Early Autumn''</NOTE><TEXT>      .... Summer fulfills the field, the heart, the womb,   While summerlong, infinitesimally,   Leaf stem, at bough-juncture, dries,   Even as our tireless bodies plunge,   With delicious muscular flexion and heart's hilarity,   White to the black ammoniac purity of   A mountain pool. But black   Is blue as it stares up at summer's depthless azure,   And azure was what we saw beneath   At the timeless instant hanging   At arc-height.   ...   How shall we know the astrolabe of joy?   Shall gratitude run forward as well as back?   Who once would have thought that the heart,   Still ravening on the world's provocation and beauty, might,   After time long lost   In the tangled briars of youth,   Have picked today as payday, the payment      In life's dime-thin, thumb-worn, two-sided, two-faced coin?
