And some investors think it might beworth taking a flier on that vision.   &quot;ATandamp;T is old merchandise with a new dream, and it's one ofmy stocks for 1992,&quot; says New York money manager MartinSosnoff of Atalanta/Sosnoff Capital. He recently spent about$36 million to buy ATandamp;T shares at about the current price of38 1/4, and he hopes ATandamp;T might be a $60 stock in two years.</LP><TEXT>   It should be said up front that even ATandamp;T's fans on WallStreet haven't really forgiven ATandamp;T managers who recentlywent out and boldly spent the equivalent of $7.5 billion tobuy NCR Corp. at a time when such computer companies all arehaving troubles.   Still, ATandamp;T is winning some applause for steps taken inrecent years to become a global telecommunications giant thatrubs shoulders with the likes of British Telecom and Sweden'sLM Ericsson. ATandamp;T's sales of telephone systems to foreigncompanies are growing fast, and in long-distance calls, itsbiggest and most crucial business, analysts say ATandamp;T at lastseems to have stopped losing ground to MCI Communications, afierce competitor.   If the economy picks up and ATandamp;T can stem its perenniallosses on computers, some money managers and analysts thinkits profit could grow by at least 13% annually in comingyears, perhaps much faster than the average company.   There aren't many companies such as ATandamp;T -- with goodbalance sheets, strong cash flows and hopes for good growth-- that still trade below market multiples, money manager Mr.Sosnoff says.   However, ATandamp;T, up this year by about 26% while the broadmarket has gained about 19%, isn't cheap for a utility -- andit could get cheaper if the economy, or NCR, faltered. Thoughthe downside might be only a few points, ATandamp;T &quot;could be anunderperformer&quot; next year, says Michael Holland of SalomonBrothers Asset Management, who recently looked the stock overand didn't buy.   ATandamp;T would only look cheap if it could add a couple ofpercentage points to its annual growth rate, as the moremodest bulls hope. ATandamp;T stock now costs about 12.5 timesanalysts' estimates of 1992 per-share profit. By comparison,Standard andamp; Poor's estimated price-earnings ratio forutilities is 11.5, and for the Sandamp;P 500 stock index, around27.   ATandamp;T analysts generally expect profit of $3.03 a sharenext year and $3.42 in 1993, up from an estimated $2.67 ashare on operations this year. But bears think it might be astretch for ATandamp;T to make that much money, given its recentresults. In the third quarter, the merged ATandamp;T and NCRactually earned 64 cents a share, compared with 62 cents ashare a year earlier, says Curt Fields, ATandamp;T'sinvestor-relations officer. This profit number excludes along list of special items, including $4.2 billion of pretaxmerger and restructuring charges.   ATandamp;T's Mr. Fields says that 14 of 18 Wall Street analystswhom he tracks &quot;have buy recommendations on us.&quot; Still,there's a big worry for investors: Could NCR be a black holefor ATandamp;T?   &quot;History is replete with examples of computer acquisitionsthat haven't worked,&quot; says Salomon's Mr. Holland. ATandamp;T's owncomputer business in recent years lost 20 cents to 30 cents ashare every year, estimates PaineWebber's Jack Grubman, andin the third quarter ATandamp;T took one of its many big write-offsas it restructured its computer and other businesses andmerged with NCR.   &quot;If computers continue to bleed,&quot; they could cut 10 centsto 15 cents a share off ATandamp;T's annual profit, Mr. Grubmanfigures, and some bears expect more writeoffs on computersdown the line. ATandamp;T says it doesn't anticipate such charges.   However, Mr. Grubman and other analysts hope ATandamp;T'scomputer operations will at least break even next year,partly because NCR's operations haven't historically incurredlosses. Write-offs wouldn't ruin the company's health; it hasa lot of equity and it's expected to throw off about $1billion of spare cash flow this year -- after constructionand dividends.   The key to ATandamp;T's future earnings remains long-distancecalls, which kick in more than half of revenue and almost allof profit. &quot;For the first time in 20 years,&quot; says Mr.Grubman, ATandamp;T has stopped losing market share in thisbusiness. That, alone, could add 25 cents a share to annualprofit, analysts say. While some money managers think ATandamp;Tcould lose customers if it has more closedowns of lines likethe recent one that disrupted East Coast businesses and airtravel, ATandamp;T says it anticipates &quot;minimal loss of customersas a result of the outages.&quot;   The marvel is that ATandamp;T has done so well, considering thelosses on other businesses. It could add a total of about 25cents a share in annual profit by fixingit's working onthem-its &quot;black holes&quot; in computers, telephone equipment andlines and credit cards, says Donaldson Lufkin andamp; Jenrette'sJoel Gross.   Some think ATandamp;T could add another five cents a share inannual profit growth from sales of telephone equipment toforeign companies. This year, says analyst Mr. Gross,foreign-equipment sales have soared 50%.   ATandamp;T has some prominent holders. In August, with ATandamp;Tstock at about 38 5/8, Capital Group of Los Angeles struck adeal valued at about $650 million with ATandamp;T that made it thecompany's largest shareholder, with about a 1.6% stake.   Individual investors, who historically owned about threequarters of ATandamp;T's stock outstanding, have been buying theshares enthusiastically in recent months, says market analystLaszlo Birinyi of Birinyi Associates in New York. Big moneymanagers also have to consider that ATandamp;T is a big part of theSandamp;P index. So, he says, &quot;owning Telephone is partly astatement about the market.&quot;   ---   ATandamp;T   (NYSE: Symbol: T)                                                                                                          Business: Telecommunications, computers                                                                                                          Nine months ended Sept. 30, 1991   Revenue: $32.71 billion   Net loss: $113 million; or 9 cents                                                                                                          Third quarter, Sept. 30, 1991:   Per-share net-loss: $1.40 vs. profit: 62 cents                                                                                                          Common shares outstanding: 1.31 billion                                                                                                          Note: Latest quarter's loss is after $2.06 a share inrestructuring charges.</TEXT></DOC>
