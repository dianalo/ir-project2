<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-06-0272 </DOCNO><TEXT>Several studies of seismic hazards and seismic risk have been done forthe Los Alamos area. The most comprehensive one was completed in 1972and was intended for design engineering for the TA-55 Plutonium Facility.This study concluded that a peak horizontal acceleration of 0.33 g wasappropriate for design of facilities at TA-55 since it was &quot;unlikelyto be exceeded.&quot; Progress in several areas of earthquake studies in thepast 15 years has provided an improved understanding of earthquake occurrenceand recurrence, as well as an improved ability to estimate ground responseresulting from possible local earthquakes. Because the results of the1972 study are still being used for seismic design of new facilitiesat Los Alamos, the seismic hazards and risks for Los Alamos should bereevaluated in order to confirm that the 1972 results are still meaningfuland valid. Such a reevaluation is, however, beyond the scope of thisreport. 49 refs., 9 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
