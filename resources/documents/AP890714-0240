Those indicted were: John F. Rosch, 51, of Glen Ellyn, formerpresident of Glen Ellyn Savings, which was placed into receivershipby the U.S. government in 1985; Timothy Heuer, 29, of Dallas, formerpresident of First Savings and Loan Association of South Beloit,placed into receivership in October 1986; and Alan Kirchner, 52, ofAsheville, N.C., former president of the American Bank of Alma,Wis., placed into receivership in 1986.   Also indicted were Texas businessman James Reagin, 54, ofHouston; real estate developers C. Gary Spaniak, 57, of Cape Coral,Fla. and Norbert Murray, 53, of Naples, Fla; and attorney David R.David, 35, of Sugarland, Texas, a former associate of Reagin.   The eighth person, attorney Michael Pietrzak, 40, of Glen Ellyn,a former associate of Rosch, was charged in the case, but notindicted.   The Chicago Tribune quoted sources today as saying Pietrzak wasexpected to plead guilty and cooperate with the prosecution.   Rosch faces the stiffest maximum penalties if convicted _ 150years imprisonment and fines of $7.5 million, Valukas said.   But Rosch's attorney, Rick Halprin, said his client had beencleared of similar charges in Florida and he planned to pleadedinnocent in this case.   The indictment accuses Rosch, Reagin, Heuer, Kirchner, Murray andothers of conspiring to run a group of lending institutions througha pattern of racketeering activity involving repeated acts of mailand wire fraud.   It also alleges that Reagin, Murray, Spaniak and others gave orpromised money and property in the form of loans to Rosch, Heuer andKirchner, the indictment reads.
