McCLAIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Regardless of the Middle East's impact on theworld's oil bill, Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher believesU.S. exports will continue to grow and keep the nation's economyout of recession this year.   But he admitted in an interview that rising oil costs could ruinhis prediction that the nation's merchandise trade deficit willcome in under $100 billion this year for the first time since 1983.   Mosbacher commented in his fifth floor office following hisdepartment's announcement Friday that exports in June reached arecord $34.3 billion and helped drive the trade deficit that monthto just $5.07 billion.   That was the slimmest imbalance since the deficit dropped to$3.96 billion in June 1983.   Assuming oil prices decline soon, he said, ``we're headed atclose to a $90 billion trade deficit this year _ it could be $95billion, under $100 billion is what I've been saying.''   That would be more than a one-third cut from the 1987 peakdeficit of $152.12 billion. The imbalance has declined each yearsince then, falling to $109 billion last year.   So far this year, Mosbacher said, the deficit has tumbled to$45.8 billion, the lowest six-month imbalance since the second halfof 1983.   But he admitted that continued high oil prices could add to thecost of imports which dropped to $39.37 billion in June and helpednarrow the deficit.   ``If the price of oil doesn't stay up very long, we'll stillmake it,'' he said. The price of oil on Friday was nearly twice the$14.64 a barrel that it averaged during June.   Many analysts have said they believe skyrocketing oil priceswill add to the cost of imports in the second half of the year,offsetting the effect of export growth on the deficit.   The secretary contended that ``the price of oil is not as bigrelatively overseas as it is here'' and will not substantially cutinto purchases of U.S. goods.   ``So, I think we'll continue to have a good market,'' he said.``You know, we're now in a trade surplus with Europe and I thinkwe'll hold that.''   The surplus with Europe totaled $806.2 million in June, pushingthe six-month total to $4.34 billion. At the same time, the deficitwith Japan _ as usual, the biggest _ fell from $24.42 billion inthe first half of 1989 to $19.59 billion from January through Juneof this year.   ``We've had some real improvement'' with Japan, Mosbacher said.``We're down from almost $50 billion last year to what looks like$40 billion this year, plus or minus.''   The commerce secretary attributed the export progress to thedecline in the dollar, improved quality of U.S. goods and greaterexport expertise.   ``U.S. goods are a lot cheaper overseas now for thesecustomers,'' he said. ``Plus, our quality keeps improving and ourknowledge of how to export ... keeps improving. And finally, thegovernment's working with exporters.''   Thus far, he said, the rising exports ``shows American businessis competitive around the world, it shows American business isbeginning to realize it's a global marketplace, with the biggestpotential area of growth and unsatisfied demand outside the U.S.''</TEXT></DOC>
