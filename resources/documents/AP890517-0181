Gorbachev to clarify the Soviet commitment to the treatybanning medium-range nuclear-armed missiles worldwide.   The senators said they were disturbed by a recent remarks bySoviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze that the Soviets mightnot dismantle their SS-23 medium-range missiles as required by thetreaty if NATO nations modernize their short-range nuclear weapons.   Sen. Nancy Landon Kassebaum, R-Kan., an organizer of theletter-writing effort, noted that the Intermediate-Range NuclearForces treaty does not ban short-range missiles with a range under300 miles.   Therefore, she said, modernization by NATO of such short-rangemissiles would not violate the treaty.   ``We find these remarks very troubling,'' the committee memberstold Bush.   ``Mr. Shevardnadze's suggestion that the Soviets might not abideby the terms of the treaty in response to the modernization ofsystems which are not covered by the treaty, threatens to challengethe integrity of the INF accord, as well as overall confidence inthe arms control process,'' they said.   It is in ``neither side's interest at this time to challengethat agreement,'' the senators said. ``Both sides should instead bebuilding on the achievements of the INF accord and moving forwardto take advantage of the many promising opportunities before us inEast-West relations.''   The senators urged the president ``to seek a clarification fromGeneral Secretary Gorbachev as to the Soviets' commitments to theINF accord and to consult with us on these developments.''   The Senate ratified the INF treaty on a 93-5 roll call last yearafter a lengthy debate.</TEXT></DOC>
