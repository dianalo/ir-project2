Yigal Carmon, special adviser on terrorism to Prime MinisterYitzhak Shamir, told a news conference Arafat was involved through``approval of plans, issuing orders and allocating the fundsnecessary for the special operations.''   ``There are other types of involvement, but I cannot specify,''he added.   The 10 acts Carmon listed ranged from the July 1987 assassinationin London of Palestinian cartoonist Naji al-Ali, known for hisanti-Arafat drawings, to the April 1986 bombing of a TWA jetlinerover Greece which killed four people.   Carmon gave no specifics and would not say how Israeli officialsconcluded Arafat was personally linked to the incidents.   His remarks came at a government-sponsored briefing held tocounter claims by Arafat that the Palestine Liberation Organizationhas accepted Israel and renounced the use of terrorism.   A group of nine dovish Labor Party legislators published astatement Monday saying they would endorse peace talks with the PLOif the PLO followed up its acceptance of Israel with a renunciationof terrorism.   The statement appeared in leading newspapers and was seen as asignificant shift in the thinking of mainstream politicians.Supporters included Yossi Beilin, a former senior aide to ForeignMinister Shimon Peres.   It said that ``prospects of opening negotiations with thisPalestinian leadership'' have been brought closer, but that``without an unequivocal decision to renounce terror and stoppingit, there will be no negotiations.''   The PLO condemned terror but said the organization will continuearmed operations in Israeli-held territory.</TEXT></DOC>
