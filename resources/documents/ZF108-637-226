Harris, director of Senate informationsystems and technology.andM;The authorization was essential if the Senate wanted to avoid delaying theaward until September, he said.andM;The expected cost of switching to the new network is $95 million over thenext decade, Harris said.andP;  This cost includes the $65 million contract andtransition costs.andP;  The Senate will maintain existing data links betweenoffices while the new network is being installed, he said.andM;The Senate's network push coincides with the growing use of personalcomputers by senators.andP;  For six years, dating back to 1982, Senate officescould select from only three brands of minicomputers through contracts withHoneywell Inc., Data General Corp. and Prime Computer Inc.andP;  But pockets of PCusers have sprung up in the Senate.andP;  Since 1988 more than 3,000 desktopmachines, bought mostly through a contract with Memorex Telex Corp., havebeen installed in both Washington and constituent offices.andP;  Several othertypes of PCs also can be found in Senate offices.andM;Meanwhile, the Senate also plans to award a requirements contract for 80386,386SX and 68030 microcomputers that would mean even more desktop choices forsenators.andP;  The Senate is evaluating the proposals now.andM;Now some dozen or so Ethernet local area networks form the Senate'sConstituent Services System.andP;  But this system provides only limited linkagesand does not allow for interconnections among Capitol Hill offices.andP;  The X.25network requested by the Senate would provide all Senate offices, includingalmost 10,000 users, with a common communications link.andM;The contract award has slipped by about three months.andP;  When the Senate issuedthe request for proposals last year, officials said they hoped to award acontract in mid-spring and have the network operational by early 1991.andO;Depending on the specifics, if the award is made before September, the Senatestill might have the network up by early next year.andM;Harris would not talk further about the technical details of the networkbecause final negotiations are continuing.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
