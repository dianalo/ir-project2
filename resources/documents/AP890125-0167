(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Officials on Wednesday abandoned hope offinding any more survivors of the earthquake and mudslide thatinundated three mountain villages, and said this settlement would bededicated as a common grave.   Along with the bad news that no more survivors could expect to befound, there also was good news: officials said the death toll fromMonday's disaster was only about a quarter of the 1,000 theyoriginally had estimated.   In addition, a young man described how his 6-day-old cousinmiraculously survived the quake, held aloft in her father's hands ashe and his household died in a torrent of mud.   Kholmurod Barotov, 17, a worker in a Sharora bakery, said hismother had gone to stay with her sister, who had just given birth toa daughter.   His aunt's house was completely buried by the mudslide, but thelittle girl survived because her father, 30-year-old herdsmanSaifulo Khodzhayev, held her above his head as he and the rest ofthe family died, he said.   ``We will transform the settlement of Sharora into a common gravewith a monument to commemorate the victims of this catastrophe,''said Khusain Kasymov, Communist Party chief in the Tadzhikistanrepublic's Gissar region.   The religious leader of predominantly Moslem Tadzhikistan, AkbarKakharov, participated in discussions leading to that decision,media reports said.   ``Regrettably, there is no one left who can be saved,'' he toldthe official Tass news agency. ``Let the remains of the deceasedremain at the place where they died.''   ``Moslem law, the Shariah, says that people buried alive must beleft there,'' said Izzatullo Khayoyev, prime minister of the CentralAsian republic.   He said relatives of those killed in Sharora decided to fence offthe farming settlement and make it into a common grave.   Within 12 hours of the quake and mudslide that struck the areaearly Monday, the official news media estimated that as many as1,000 people might have died.   But Khayoyev told reporters in an impromptu interview Wednesdaythat 274 people were confirmed dead. ``There may be a differnce offive or seven people in casualties, but no more,'' he said.   He said a nationwide census completed only four days before thequake struck helped provide a quick and accurate count of thevillages' residents.   Officials said the earthquake, which was recorded as 5.4 on theRichter scale, toppled all 80 brick-and-straw dwellings in thesettlement of Okuli-bolo, located on the north side of the Babataghills about 20 miles southwest of the Tadzhikistan capital Dushanbe.   The quake loosened saturated soil on both sides of the hill. Onthe north side, it came crashing down in seconds onto Sharora, whichwas located next to Okuli-bolo.   But on the south side, about 1} miles away, the mud slippedslowly down the hill toward Okuli-poyen. The town was destroyed, butresidents managed to escape in time.   All flags were at half-staff, plays and concerts were canceled,and restaurants were shut down in Dushanbe and across the smallrepublic as a day of mourning was declared.   Khayoyev said losses were estimated at $24 million, according toTass.   He said 75 people had been hospitalized in Dushanbe and Gissarand that 17 had been discharged.   The homeless were being put up in mobile wagons, shepherds'dwellings and tent, Tass said. The number of people involved was notgiven.   Tass said the destroyed villages would be rebuilt elsewhere. ``Awas taken to rebuild at a new place the village of Sharora, whichhad been turned into a common grave by underground shocks. Designersalso pinpointed places for other ravaged villages,'' it said.``Construction will start in several days' time.''</TEXT></DOC>
