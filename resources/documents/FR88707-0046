FossilEnergy has been screening world energy markets to identify opportunitiesfor using the technical innovations we are promoting domestically as thebasis for encouraging foreign countries to look to U.S. coal and coal technologiesto meet their energy needs in the future. Converting these opportunitiesto concrete realities requires that DOE accomplish the following: (1) Anaccurate screening of opportunities; (2) a correct focus on the most attractivepossibilities; (3) provide U.S. industry with sufficient information topermit following up on opportunities; and (4) provide potential foreignproject participants with an accurate picture of U.S. coal and technologycapabilities.The objective of this meeting is to provide industry with a readout onour progress to date and to get industry reaction to our efforts in orderto steer our activities in the most productive directions possible.The meeting is planned to consist of (1) a morning plenary session at whichDOE will provide industry with a background of the initiative and presentits preliminary findings, (2) an afternoon breakdown into small workinggroups for interactive discussion of private sector viewpoints regardingall issues involved in proceeding with this initiative, followed by (3)a closing summary session at which working group leaders will report theresults of their individual sessions.A no-host luncheon will be offered to participants at a cost of $30.00per person. A speaker will be provided who will focus on Private SectorFinancial Support for Project Implementation. An expression of interestin attending this luncheon, along with payment of fee, must be receivedno later than July 12, 1988, at the address below.

At this meeting, emphasis will beplaced on coal combustion technologies and equipment for use in small combustormarkets, work being done on coal-water mixtures at the DOE Pittsburgh EnergyTechnology Center, and barriers to commercialization and internationalcompetitiveness for U.S. Clean Coal Technologies. The date, location andfurther information for this meeting will be announced in a later notice.<ITAG tagnum="6">J.
