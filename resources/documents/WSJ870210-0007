SchmittStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 02/10/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> BAC ITENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM)BANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK) </IN><TEXT>   First Interstate Bancorp withdrew its offer to acquire BankAmerica Corp., asserting that management of the ailing San Francisco banking concern had stripped it of value, making the offer too high.    &quot;The continuing dismemberment of this institution no longer justifies our current offered price,&quot; said Joseph J. Pinola, First Interstate's chairman and chief executive officer.    As reported, Los Angeles-based First Interstate planned to begin an offer to take control of BankAmerica for securities that First Interstate valued at $3.23 billion, or $21 for each of BankAmerica's 154 million shares outstanding. First Interstate previously had offered to negotiate a friendly acquisition valued at slightly more.    BankAmerica's board last month rejected the offers as financially inadequate.    Although the proposal is dead for now, First Interstate left open the possibility of renewing its assault if BankAmerica again stumbles. The bank holding company said it was &quot;deferring all actions&quot; in connection with acquiring BankAmerica, but would &quot;continue to monitor closely the activities&quot; of the company.    A First Interstate adviser said a future offer was &quot;certainly possible because the strategy is so appealing and sound.&quot; But the adviser added, &quot;This really is a withdrawal for the immediate future. You could see a resumption, but it won't be tomorrow or next week or anything like that.&quot;    A First Interstate spokesman declined to comment on whether the bid would be revived. He said the board was &quot;supportive of our plan to make an offer and has been supportive of our decision to withdraw.&quot; He said the decision to drop the offer was made in the past week and was discussed with directors yesterday.    A.W. Clausen, BankAmerica's chairman and chief executive officer, said First Interstate's decision was &quot;definitely in the interest of BankAmerica and all its shareholders.&quot; Mr. Clausen, who was Mr. Pinola's boss at BankAmerica in the 1970s, said, &quot;It's regrettable that (First Interstate) chose to couch its withdrawal in a petulant tone of disparagement of our institution, but we suspect that there is a great deal of disappointment on their part.&quot;    BankAmerica has been massively shrinking itself by selling assets to improve its capital position as well to earn short-term gains to cover recently large operating losses. It sold almost $10 billion of assets in the fourth quarter and had assets of $104 billion at Dec. 31, compared with $196 billion at Citicorp, which BankAmerica had eclipsed in the 1970s as the nation's largest bank.    For example, BankAmerica sold its Italian bank in December for roughly $600 million, and last week it agreed to sell its highly profitable Charles Schwab andamp; Co. discount brokerage unit back to the unit's founder for $230 million and a share of the firm's future growth.    Mr. Pinola is understood to have considered both sales as mistakes.    &quot;As profitable and strategic BankAmerica Corp. assets are sold, the remaining Latin American debt and other LDC (less developed country) debt, together with other substantial nonperforming assets become an increasingly larger part of the smaller banking company,&quot; Mr. Pinola said. &quot;Further, the capital raised through sale of these assets is required to support the balance sheet and thus not available for asset growth.&quot;    &quot;For these reasons -- BankAmerica's weakened asset mix and reduced earning power -- we see much less value to the First Interstate Bancorp shareholder, thus precipitating our withdrawal action,&quot; Mr. Pinola said.    BankAmerica has $7 billion in Latin debt and more than $4 billion in nonperforming loans. Many bank experts believe those troubles will keep BankAmerica a poor performer for years, after losses totaling $855 million in 1985 and 1986.    First Interstate's announcement came after the markets closed. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, First Interstate closed at $56, down 50 cents, on volume of 90,600 shares. Also on the Big Board, BankAmerica closed at $13.875, unchanged, on volume of 172,100 shares.    BankAmerica's stock price, once buoyed by takeover speculation, has slipped somewhat in recent weeks, as the company made clear its resolve to remain independent. Later this month, it plans to begin part of a previously reported $1 billion offering of preferred stock and subordinated debt to raise new capital. The move would help resuscitate the company's weakened finances but potentially dilute the interests of current shareholders, who have endured the bank's record loan losses and its decision last year to eliminate the common stock dividend.    First Interstate had made restoring the dividends a major point in its takeover attempt. The prospect of renewed dividends as well as an offer that First Interstate said approximated BankAmerica's book value won Mr. Pinola support from many institutional holders of BankAmerica stock.    &quot;It is unfortunate that BankAmerica shareholders have not only been denied the right to receive a premium for their stock but instead face probable dilution&quot; resulting from the $1 billion securities offering, First Interstate said. &quot;Most important,&quot; the company said, was that BankAmerica shareholders lost &quot;the right to vote for or against our proposal.&quot;    Mr. Pinola has been stalking BankAmerica for more than a year. A merger of the two companies would create the dominant bank in California.    At one point last year, according to First Interstate regulatory filings, BankAmerica's then president and chief executive, Samuel Armacost, encouraged Mr. Pinola to pursue the merger. But Mr. Armacost was ousted in October, and Mr. Clausen, BankAmerica's top officer in the 1970s, returned to the helm and vowed to help the bank regain its &quot;place of prominence&quot; without the help of Mr. Pinola. Mr. Pinola was one of Mr. Clausen's executive vice presidents before leaving in 1976 to join the company that now is First Interstate.    Mr. Clausen still has a lot of work before him. Based on 1986 fourth-quarter results, BankAmerica currently is incurring an operating loss of $300 million annually. Even if the company meets its indicated goals of slashing expenses by $300 million and loan losses by $400 million, its profitability, based on return on assets, will be just two-thirds the level of the company's peers in the industry. Mr. Clausen himself conceded recently that he couldn't predict when BankAmerica will recover fully. But he said 1987 will be the company's &quot;turnaround year.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
