Bush scooped the Midland, Texas, girl into his arms Wednesdayduring a White House ceremony honoring Sioux City, Iowa, for itsresponse to the crash of a United Airlines jumbo jet last July 19.   Jessica grabbed Bush's glasses off his face and faced theclicking cameras with them balanced on her nose.   Even as he walked into the Roosevelt Room to present the MidlandCommunity Spirit Award to Sioux City, Jessica did not appearimpressed.   ``Who's that, mama?'' asked the blue-eyed girl in a red corduroysmock with Winnie the Pooh on the front, tossing her ponytail.   Later, as she returned his glasses to Bush's breast pocket,Jessica discovered the president's white handkerchief.   ``This may make that _ what do you call it? _ the blooper of theweek,'' said the president after Jessica tried to drape thehandkerchief over his head and dabbed his nose.   ``I'm sorry about that. You can go to your mother,'' he said,laughing and handing the wriggling girl to her mother, 20-year-oldReba ``Cissy'' McClure.   After paying tribute to Sioux City as an example of his``thousand points of lights'' volunteerism, Bush said, ``Thank youall and as for you, Jessica, where's my handkerchief?''   And as the audience howled, Bush asked: ``How old are you now?''   She held up three fingers.   ``C'mon Jessica. You want to see where I work?'' Bush said, andthe two, with her parents trailing behind, bounded off to the OvalOffice.   Mrs. McClure said the Oct. 16, 1987 rescue of her daughter, whowas 18 months old at the time, was similar to the rescue ofpassengers trapped inside Flight 232.   ``Everybody pulled together to save the people,'' she said.``There were people trapped in that plane and couldn't get out _mothers and fathers and children and they couldn't find them. Andthat's exactly how I felt _ I was running through the back yardlooking for my child and I couldn't find her.''   Mayor Carroll Thomas said the Midland Community Spirit Awardwould be given annually to recognize ``the community that bestexemplifies volunteerism and compassion and concern for theirfellow citizens.''   There were 85 entries for the award, with the words: ``Nothingthe heart gives away is gone; it is kept in the hearts of others''around a bronze reproduction of a plaque at Midland's civic centerthat shows rescuers bringing Jessica out of the well.   The United DC-10 crashed in Sioux City after its rear enginedisintegrated in flight, severing the plane's hydraulic system andmaking it virtually impossible to control. The crew almost landedthe plane, but it crashed on the runway, killing 112 people.Another 184 passengers survived.</TEXT></DOC>
