The experimental part ofthe program involves the use of laser spectroscopic techniques for insitu measurements during CVD. The theoretical part of the program consistsof a computer model that contains a detailed description of the coupledfluid mechanics and gas-phase chemical kinetics for silane CVD.</TEXT></DOC>
