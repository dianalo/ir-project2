Dingman, chairman and chief executive officer of Henley Group Inc., said the company may raise its lines of credit to $8 billion or more for possible investments or acquisitions.    Henley is negotiating with a group of banks led by Mellon Bank to increase its credit line to $3 billion from $1 billion, Mr. Dingman said. He said the agreement, which Henley hopes to sign early next week, also would allow the company to take on an additional $5 billion or more of debt. He noted, however, that the additional credit wouldn't necessarily be provided by banks in the group. Under the accord, outside banks could be brought in to provide the additional credit.    Together with $1.1 billion that the company says it has in cash and equivalents, the total amount available to Henley for an acquisition could be as high as $9.1 billion or more.    Mr. Dingman said the company is interested in acquiring companies &quot;in the $2 billion to $8 billion range&quot; and is &quot;looking at several companies.&quot; He wouldn't specify which industries are being reviewed, saying only that Henley is looking at undervalued &quot;plain-vanilla type companies&quot; that deal in &quot;areas where we have some knowledge.&quot;    Henley has interests in medical technology, engineering, chemicals and real estate.    Mr. Dingman added that such an acquisition wouldn't take place before the end of the year. </TEXT></DOC>
