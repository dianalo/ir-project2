The rate, which is keyed to the bank's own borrowing costs, is adjusted every six months. The latest drop was the 12th successive semiannual reduction since mid-1982, when the 151-nation agency switched to a variable lending rate.    Although interest rates in world capital markets have been edging up recently, World Bank officials said the refinancing of some of the bank's borrowings at lower rates in Japan and other countries helped to lay the groundwork for the reduction in its own lending rate.    The new rate will be applicable for interest-rate payments by borrowing countries to the World Bank during the second half of 1988. The interest rate on World Bank loans was reduced last January to 7.72% from 7.76%. </TEXT></DOC>
