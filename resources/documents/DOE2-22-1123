With the spontaneouslysymmetry breaking down to the O(3) level the 't Hooft Polyakov SO(3)monopole theory along with its triplet of scalar fields is reproducedand developed to the extent necessary to establish our results. It isshown that the existence of the monopole triggers the Cabibbo rotationof d and s along with the v/sub e/ and v/sub {mu}/ flavours, which, inturn results in the neutrino oscillations. The neutrino oscillation angleturns out to be the Cabibbo angle. Using the experimental data of Bakeret al. we have set an upper limit on {Delta}m/sup 2/{le}1.3 ev/sup 2/({Delta}m/sup 2/ident tom/sub {mu}//sup 2/-m/sub e//sup 2/). Furthermore,it is exactly the Cabibbo angle in which the isovector phi-vector hasto be rotated so as to spontaneously break the symmetry down to the O(3)level, together with, on the SO(3) sector to the U(1) level. Also itturns out that the Weinberg angle is twice the Cabibbo angle, a resultalready noted by the author elsewhere. (author). 22 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
