Theresults demonstrate that significant effects can be measured after 20priming X-ray doses as small as 0.15 or 0.25 Gy per fraction. The resultsare consistent with the LQ model remaining valid down to such small dosesper fraction, the same value of {alpha}/ {beta}(approx. 3 Gy) being foundas in previous multi-equal-dose experiments using higher doses per fraction.They are also consistent with no significant repair below about approx.0.5 Gy per fraction. It is concluded that dose sparing does continueto increase consistently with the LQ model, certainly at doses down to1.4 Gy, and probably down to 0.8 Gy per fraction. No significant furthersparing would be expected below 0.3 Gy per fraction in any case.</TEXT></DOC>
