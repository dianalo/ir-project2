Protesters threw firebombs and rocks during clashes in thecapital and police responded with tear gas. At least five studentswere reported hurt.   The protests broke out after about two dozen students stormed theheadquarters of the governing Democratic Justice Party in Seoul andbriefly occupied the roof and hurled firebombs at police.   The protesters were overpowered and arrested by about 100 riotpolice.   Clashes later broke out at Seoul National, Dongguk and Kon Kukuniversities, with police involved in running battles with studentswho hurled firebombs and rocks and shouted anti-Roh slogans.   About 1,500 students were involved in the clashes.   Police also reported an attack on a party office in eastern Seoulby a dozen students Thursday night. Police said the students fledafter hurling firebombs and shattering windows.   Some opposition and dissident groups are making a joint effort todefeat Roh in an upcoming national referendum. Radical students vowto stage a wave of anti-Roh street demonstrations prior to theplebiscite, expected in mid-April.   Roh told a meeting of senior government prosecutors today hewould soon call the referendum and that the government must take astand against radical groups espousing leftist revolution.   Roh promised in a 1987 campaign to hold a referendum to letpeople assess his performance. Government officials have said Rohwould stay in power even if he is defeated, but opponents contendthe president must resign if he fails to win a majority.   Opposition leader Kim Young-sam today urged Roh to resign toclear the way for a new presidential election. The head of thesecond-largest opposition party, Reunification Democratic Party,said he would step up a campaign to defeat Roh in the referendum.   Meanwhile, Seoul's subway service remained disrupted for thesecond straight day today as many striking workers ignored a warningor return to work immediately or face dismissal or otherdisciplinary action.   About half the subway's 7,732 workers reported today, but many ofthem refused to work. Subway officials said several days would beneeded before full service is restored.   Police arrested about 2,300 strikers Thursday at a subway depot,but released most today.   Prosecutors said they would charge 15 union leaders fororganizing the strike, which was spurred by demands that the head ofthe subway corporation be fired for purportedly bargaining in badfaith during recent labor talks.</TEXT></DOC>
