The offering, rated triple-A by both Moody's Investors Service Inc. and Standard andamp; Poor's Corp., is the first public issue backed by commercial mortgages that doesn't give investors any recourse to the parent company. Investors in the Meritor securities will be able to look only to the pool of mortgages for payment of principal and interest.    However, Meritor Financial, a Philadelphia thrift institution and financial services concern, will keep an 11.75% subordinated interest in the pool of mortgages. Because any losses go first to the subordinated holder, that gives investors in the senior, publicly issued debt some protection.    The key to doing the offering in the public market was the triple-A rating, said Richard Moore, a vice president at lead manager Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. The firm wasn't sure it would be able to get a top rating from both major rating companies, which use different criteria in judging issues backed by commercial mortgages. Until recently, &quot;Moody's hasn't had criteria as well publicized and defined&quot; as Sandamp;P's, he said.    The Meritor issue took four months to put together, including a six-week wait for Securities and Exchange Commission approval. But Mr. Moore said he didn't expect future offerings would take that long.    The issue, by Meritor Mortgage Securities Corp., consists of $87.1 million of two-year certificates, priced to yield 8.95%; $71.8 million of five-year certificates, priced to yield 9.72%; and $54 million of seven-year certificates, priced to yield 10.15%. </TEXT></DOC>
