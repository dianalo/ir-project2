Sesit (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> EUROP CANDA FREST JAPAN </CO><IN> MON PCS CMD FRX </IN><TEXT>   This Friday's report of U.S. trade statistics will provide a big test of central banks' recent campaign to prop up the dollar, economists say.    Most analysts expect the U.S. to report a $14 billion to $15.5 billion deficit for November. That compares with a record $17.6 billion deficit for October, reported last month. Any additional narrowing of the trade gap could help the dollar; a figure larger than expected could put the dollar under heavy pressure again.    If the next two trade reports &quot;come in at a reasonable level, the dollar rally could last for five or six weeks,&quot; says Geoffrey Dennis, an international economist at James Capel andamp; Co. in London.    Mr. Dennis says that for seasonal reasons, U.S. trade results normally improve at year end. In addition, recent declines in oil prices should help cut U.S. imports significantly, and U.S. consumer spending may be slackening off in reaction to October's stock market crash, especially in consumer electronics and automobiles. Imports make up a large part of both those goods' U.S. sales.    But a poor showing on the trade deficit could undercut the dollar. John Lipsky, a Salomon Brothers Inc. economist, observes that the dollar's recent rebound &quot;has occurred in the absence of any fundamental changes&quot; in the U.S. economy.    Mr. Lipsky adds, &quot;In the course of the year, the markets will be disappointed in the slow pace of the (U.S.) current account adjustment and take the dollar back down. We still could see the dollar below 120 yen and 1.50 marks by the latter part of the year.&quot; The current account includes trade in goods and services, as well as financial transfers such as interest payments to foreign holders of American debt.    Even Mr. Dennis says that the recent bout of central bank intervention should be seen as just &quot;a shot in the arm.&quot; The British economist adds: &quot;The fundamentals are no different than what they were (Jan. 4) in Tokyo when the dollar didn't seem to have a friend in the world; there's no reason now to get overly optimistic.&quot;    Mr. Dennis and others don't see further reductions of the U.S. budget deficit any time soon. And they contend the administration will be unwilling to raise interest rates significantly in a presidential election year. Both moves would help support the dollar, especially in the eyes of foreign investors.    &quot;What we want is an inflow of private capital&quot; to finance the trade and budget deficits, says Scott E. Pardee, the vice chairman of the U.S. unit of Japan's Yamaichi Securities Co. &quot;That has dried up.&quot;    Mr. Pardee, a former senior official of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, says Yamaichi has seen some foreign purchases of U.S. Treasury securities. But &quot;they've been sold quickly for profit when the market traded up. We haven't seen long-term serious foreign investors.&quot;    The recent U.S. intervention to support the dollar, he says, is &quot;a political decision to have more peace and quiet in the exchange and domestic markets than we've had. If the dollar stabilizes or rises somewhat, then both the stock and bond markets can do better.&quot;    Last week's central bank intervention helped the dollar rise more than 5% against the Japanese yen and West German mark, from its historic lows at the start of the week. Traders estimate that the Fed, the Bank of Japan, the West German Bundesbank and other central banks spent at least $3 billion to support the dollar.    ---   Friday's Market Activity   The dollar ended lower in light trading as the currency was pressured by sharply declining New York stock prices and a report that the federal budget deficit for fiscal 1989 may exceed the legal ceiling.    Traders also said the scheduled announcement of the trade figures this Friday kept many investors on the sidelines.    A snowstorm in the Northeast sent many market participants home early, accounting for the thinness of trading, dealers said.    Late in the New York business day, the dollar traded around 1.6390 marks, down from 1.6580 marks late Thursday in New York. The dollar was changing hands around 128.33 yen late Friday in New York, down from 130.23 yen late Thursday.    The dollar began climbing in early trading in Tokyo Monday as the market anticipated central bank intervention, traders said. In midday trading, the dollar was quoted at 128.45 yen, up from 127.90 yen at the opening.    The U.S. unit eased Friday against the pound and the Swiss and French francs but was higher against its Canadian counterpart.    A Friday morning story by the Washington Post caused a stir in the market that was responsible for the dollar's decline early in the day, traders said.    The newspaper reported that it had obtained White House budget documents that predicted the U.S. budget deficit could widen to $167 billion in fiscal 1989. The Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget deficit law sets a deficit limit of $136 billion.    Late in the New York business day, sharply lower New York Stock Exchange prices caused the currency to accelerate its decline, traders said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average posted its third-largest point drop in history by falling 140.58 to 1911.31.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose $2.50 an ounce to $483.70 in moderate trading. The estimated volume was 2.8 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $484.55 an ounce in early trading Monday in Hong Kong.    ---                      LATE NEW YORK TRADING                     Friday, January 8, 1988   Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
