An accidental resonance of some lines of theO I multiplet at 1026-A with the broad solar Lyman-beta line can in factaccount for the observed emission rate, based on analysis with a MonteCarlo radiative transport model. Photoelectron excitation of atomic oxygenis negligible compared with resonant scattering. These airglow resultssupport a ratio of 66 to 1 for the solar Lyman-alpha to Lyman-beta linecenter fluxes.</TEXT></DOC>
