The justices, without comment, let stand a federal appeals courtruling that blocked such fishing.   At issue is an interpretation of a federal law, the Marine MammalProtection Act of 1972, which spells out how marine mammals may be``taken'' _ hunted, captured or killed _ in U.S. waters.   The law generally bans all such takings of marine mammals butcontains an exception allowing the secretary of commerce toauthorize specified takings incidental to commercial fishing.   The secretary, however, may not allow incidental takings of anymarine mammal species in danger of significant depletion orextinction.   The United States requires fishing permits within a 200-mileprotected zone.   In 1986, the Federation of Japan Salmon Fisheries CooperativeAssociations sought to extend a permit under which it would beentitled to snare up to 5,500 Dall's porpoise a year in salmongillnets cast in the waters of the north Pacific Ocean and theBering Sea.   Other sea mammals such as Northern fur seals and sea lions alsobecome snarled in the nets, some of which are nine miles long.   Commerce Secretary C. William Verity issued a general permit forthe Japanese fishermen to operate after finding that the Dall'sporpoise population would not be threatened.   He could not make such a determination, however, for the Northernfur seal or Northern sea lion populations.   Environmental and Native Alaskan groups challenged the legalityof granting a permit to the Japanese fishermen.   A federal trial judge blocked the fishing operations during thesalmon season last June and July. The judge said the governmentcould not assure that some marine mammals surely to be caught in thenets are not in danger of depletion or extinction.   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here upheld the injunction by a2-1 vote, and the Supreme Court rejected the Reagan adminstration'semergency challenge of that ruling last June 9.   In the appeal acted on today, Justice Department lawyers arguedthat the practical effect of the appeals court's Feb. 16 ruling``would be to shut down large segments of commercial fishing by bothdomestic and foreign entities in U.S. waters.''   But lawyers for the environmental and Native Alaskan groups urgedthe justices to reject the appeal.   Lawyers for the Center for Environmental Education contended thatMarine Mammal Protection Act amendments enacted last Novemberindicate that Congress agreed with the appeals court'sinterpretation of the law.   ``Congress ... intentionally drafted the (amendments) so as toexclude the Japanese driftnet fleet and reauthorized theprohibitions in the (act) in their existing form,'' they argued.   The case is Verity vs. Center for Environmental Education, 88-428.</TEXT></DOC>
