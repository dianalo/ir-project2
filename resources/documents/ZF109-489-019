 A lot of the products that were unveiled in earlier formwill be demonstrated as they have progressed since April.andP;  We won't try tosummarize here what is included in the following preview, but, in theinterests of saving readers the trouble of looking for things they won'tfind, we will mention some items that won't be present:andM;* Linotype's LinoColor system, although Linotype will bring most of its otherproducts.andM;* Barco Graphics' line of color products, although Barco will show theCalibrator monitor.andM;* Scangraphic's new color capabilities, although Scangraphic will have a newPostScript imagesetter suitable for color work.andM;* Dainippon Screen's Omega network and many of its new color products,although it will bring the new Island Graphics color system.andM;* Du Pont's new ColorSpace, Mamba and midrange system developed with Fuji,although the Studio 9500 will be shown.andM;In this section, we will focus on suppliers of full systems: color scanners,image manipulation workstations and output devices, although not all of thesecompanies develop all of their own components.andP;  They do, however, supplycomplete turnkey color systems.andP;  In the next section, we will discuss colorperipherals.andM;Agfa Compugraphic  (1628)andM;Agfa Compugraphic, which launched a new ColorScape family of products atDrupa, will demonstrate the same products in San Jose, but with aconsiderable amount of progress since then.andP;  ColorScape includes the Catalystsystem for text composition and page assembly, the PIX color retouchingworkstation, the ACS 100 and the Focus color scanners, and a PostScriptoutput device, of which the new SelectSet 5000 offers the highest quality andthe ProSet 9800 provides a next level of quality.andP;  For proofs, Agfa offersthe TabScript C500 A3 dye-sublimation printer.andM;The ColorScape products are currently in beta testing.andP;  Scheduled fordeliveries early this fall.andM;In addition to these products, Agfa will demonstrate the Focus II monochromescanners for Macintosh, PC and Sun workstations; the StudioSet 2000imagesetter, based on an Adobe RIP and an Ultre recorder; and its CAPS systemfor technical documentation.andP;  For CAPS, the focus will be on version 4.0,which handles PostScript files.andP;  There will be a PC driving an HP PCL Level 5printer.andM;The Quadex system for commercial composition won't be shown.andM;Catalyst.andP;  Running on a Sun Sparcstation, Catalyst provides text compositionquality that actually exceeds the capabilities Compugraphic has supplied withits earlier text systems, plus the ability to import color files from a PIXworkstation or from a Macintosh, place them on pages and perform a variety ofoperations on them and on anything else on the page.andP;  It uses Open Lookdialog boxes and menus, providing a WYSIWYG display of pages with color andgraphics in place.andP;  Page layout is based on containers (or compartments, asAgfa calls them) that can be linked to cause text to flow from one to thenext.andP;  Irregular shapes can be created and text flowed inside or outside theshapes.andP;  Page designs can be saved and used again as master page layouts.andO;Typographic attributes can be assigned to an entire document, a set of linkedcontainers, a single container or a selected block of text.andP;  A singleCatalyst workstation costs less than $30,000.andM;PIX.andP;  The color retouching workstation, PIX handles scanning and directoutput of color images to film, but it is likely to be used for sendingimages either to a Catalyst system or to a desktop program such as QuarkXpress for incorporation in pages.andP;  Images can be zoomed on the screen (to 16times actual size), manipulated (cloned, airbrushed, etc.), color corrected(using RGB, HSL, HSV, CMY or CMYK values), and masked, working with a screenof 1,024 X 1,024 pixels.andP;  PIX currently runs on a Sun386i computer, but weexpect to see it on a Sparcstation later.andP;  The price of a single station is$64,995.andM;SelectSet 5000.andP;  One of the leading suppliers of output devices for decades,Compugraphic has developed the SelectSet 5000 as its highest-quality machineever.andP;  A rollfed unit, it advances film inside a stationary drum and recordsat resolutions of 1,200 and 2,400 dpi over an area 16&quot; X 22&quot;.andP;  The lightsource is a heliumneon laser beam.andP;  The recording speed is quoted as a pageper minute at 1,200 dpi or half that at 2,400 dpi.andP;  Unlike all other CGmachines, the 5000 will operate only in PostScript mode, using an AdobeEmerald RIP.andP;  Initial deliveries are scheduled for November.andM;Color scanners.andP;  Agfa has developed two scanners to serve different segmentsof the market.andP;  The well-known Focus units, operating at up to 800 dpi, havebeen given color capabilities (8 bits per color), initially for theMacintosh, but later for the PC and Sun platforms also.andP;  The ACS 100 supports10 bits per color, 2,400-dpi resolution, scans in a single pass, and handlestransparencies as well as reflective originals.andP;  It costs $49,000 in the U.S.andM;Arrow Systems  (2846)andM;Since 1984, Arrow has been serving prepress, photographic retouching andvisual communications markets, but it has kept a low profile.andP;  It made anappearance at the NCGA show last spring, but its current system (the ArrowColor PrePress System 3000) is virtually brand new.andP;  It's a combination ofproprietary software and integration of standard products, running the gamutfrom scanned input to high-resolution output on an Ultre or ECRM recorderdriven by an Arrow RIP.andM;Arrow offers two products.andP;  Arrow-Sys is a shell that sits over commerciallyavailable software, such as ColorStudio, PhotoShop, Illustrator, FreeHand,Xpress and PageMaker, providing easy means of accessing the desired programs.andO;Running in a Mac IIx with an accelerator, Arrow-Sys supports a variety oflarge monitors and scanners for transparencies and reflective copy.andP;  Usingmultiple processors, it provides multitasking for productivity.andM;The RIP.andP;  The second product is Arrow-RIP, a proprietary RIP to drive Ultreand ECRM PelBox 3000 imagesetters.andP;  It processes an entire page beforebeginning to image it.andM;The base price of a full system is $99,990 with an Ultre recorder and$134,000 with a PelBox 3000.andM;Bestinfo  (934)andM;We never know whether to put Bestinfo in with the monochrome systems where itstarted and where it does most of its business, or in color, where it isdoing some interesting development.andP;  This time it goes under color, althoughour preview will start with some general notes on moving to OS/2 for theWave4 line.andM;This event will mark the formal introduction of the OS/2 version ofPageWright, which will feature a radically improved user interface (based inpart of Presentation Manager facilities) and a new editing program.andM;The editor, which is accessed while the page is on the screen, doesn't havethe full functions of XyWrite, but it has much better capabilities than the&quot;exploded mode&quot; editor used to make changes to text on a page in the currentMS-DOS version of PageWright.andP;  There also will be an OS/2 version ofWordWright, supporting interactive counting.andM;Bestinfo also will demonstrate PICS, its color file conversion product;Collage, a means of merging and laying out continuous-tone images fromhigh-end color systems; QX-Link, an interface to Quark Xpress to move designcomprehensives, text and page geometry into PageWright; and the Bestinfo RIP,supporting a variety of proof printers and high-end devices.andM;ColorPrep  (2805)andM;One of a growing number of companies moving into the color market withturnkey systems is ColorPrep, based in Redwood City, California.andP;  Its system,which handles scanning through color correction and output, consists of someexisting components and some proprietary pieces developed by ColorPrep.andM;Among the scanners supported are some CCD devices and the OptronicsColorGetter.andP;  A lot of the image manipulation software has been produced byColorPrep, but the system also makes use of TIPS and other existing software.andM;ColorPrep, which has written its own dot generator, will be driving an ECRMPelBox at the exhibition.andM;Du Pont/Crosfield  (1636)andM;Crosfield, which is now part of Du Pont, will show some of the new productsit introduced at Drupa last April, but not all of them.andP;  There will be theStudio 9500 color system with its StudioLink for connection to desktop pagelayout programs.andP;  Crosfield hopes to cooperate with companies such as Quark,Letraset and Aldus to provide good demonstrations of the ability to take pagegeometry from desktop packages and incorporate high-resolution color imagesfrom a Crosfield system.andM;The Mamba and ColorSpace products introduced at Drupa won't be in the booth.andM;Also prominent will be the latest version of the Lightspeed CLS system,demonstrating a new interface to color systems (Crosfield, Hell and Scitex)and improved controls that should produce better color accuracy.andM;Among the traditional Du Pont products, there will be the Highlightmonochrome scanner with a Macintosh interface and the 4Cast color proofprinter being driven by the Lightspeed system and a Macintosh.andM;Full Color ComputingandM;Hell Graphic Systems  (2416)andM;A supplier of large, high-quality color systems, Hell will focus on its linksto other companies' systems, to the desktop and to a variety of outputdevices.andP;  It also will discuss a new program of color service bureaus andoffer consulting services to customers.andP;  In the booth will be a color systemand other equipment.andM;ChromaLink.andP;  Hell will demonstrate ChromaLink's ability to import files fromother high-end systems, such as those from Scitex and Crosfield, and tointerface to peripherals such as the Canon Color Laser Copier 500, the ECRMAutokon 2030 input scanner, and the MacDonald Dettwiler Fire 1000 filmrecorder.andM;Hell Color Service Bureau.andP;  This program is designed to assist Hell scannerand system customers to develop new business opportunities in thedesktop-to-prepress marketplace.andP;  Hell is developing a comprehensive programof national advertising and public relations, cooperative marketing, advancedtraining and expanded technical support.andM;ScriptMaster Consulting Center.andP;  Hell also will offer an opportunity for itsScriptMaster users to bring working files and learn advanced ScriptMastertechniques.andP;  Consulting services will be provided by Apogee, Inc., of St.andO;Louis, which will show how to send Scitex Visionary files throughScriptMaster, cut RIP times, troubleshoot problem files and run PostScriptfiles created on Macintoshes, PC and Sparcstations.andM;BridgIt typesetter.andP;  In the booth will be the BridgIt PostScript typesetterconsisting of a Hyphen RIP running on a Macintosh and a 72-pica Ultrerecorder (supporting resolutions from 600 dpi to 2,400 dpi).andP;  It sells forless than $30,000.andM;Color products.andP;  Hell will demonstrate the ChromaCom 1000 and 2000high-resolution workstations for cropping, retouching and enhancing colorimages from the ChromaGraph scanner, PostScript-based desktop systems, andvideo cameras, and for stripping and assembling color pages.andP;  For imageacquisition, Hell will show the DC 3000 modular scanning, previewing andrecording system, including the ChromaGraph digital scanner and ChromaLightsoft-proofing workstation.andP;  The ScriptMaster will be used to demonstratesupport for the Open Prepress Interface.andP;  ScriptMaster accepts non-PostScriptcolor images from the ChromaGraph, ChromaCom and other sources, converts theimages into TIFF and exports them to the Macintosh or PC for integration withPostScript files.andP;  Similarly, scanned color PostScript images can be sentfrom the desktop through ScriptMaster to the ChromaCom for enhancement,manipulation and pagination or to the ChromaGraph recorder for filmproduction.andM;Howtek  (1927)andM;Howtek will demonstrate products from its Colorscan group, including itsworkstation, and from its Peripherals group, including the new Personal ColorScanner and Personal Color Printer.andM;Colorscan group.andP;  In the Colorscan group, there will be the Colorscanworkstation, based on a '386 PC, a 19&quot; Barco color monitor and a 14&quot;monochrome monitor.andP;  Software will be the same as shown previously.andP;  Therewill be the Colorscan tower, a high-speed postprocessor using proprietaryhardware, plus three input scanners: the 400-dpi Scanmaster 3 flatbed unit,the Scanmaster 35 for 35mm originals, and the Scanmaster D2000, using a drum.andM;Output will be to a Pixelmaster inkjet printer and a Bidco 80CH recorder.andM;The system will be demonstrated networked using the Open Prepress Interfaceand a Macintosh workstation.andM;Peripherals.andP;  In the peripherals area, Howtek will show its Scanmaster 3 onDOS, Macintosh and Unix platforms.andP;  The new Personal Color Scanner, targetedat the business/office environment and desktop applications, will cost $1,995and support resolutions from 50 to 300 dpi (including anywhere in between),8-bit and 18-bit accuracy.andP;  This unit, developed by Howtek, was shown atComdex/Spring and at Siggraph.andP;  Shipments are expected to begin about thetime the Seybold Conference opens.andM;Two printers will be present: the Pixelmaster, for $7,900, and the PersonalColor Printer, for less than $3,000, which supports sizes only up to 8.5&quot; x11&quot;.andM;The Scanmaster 35 scanner also will be in the booth.andM;Intergraph (234)andM;The latest company to jump on the Quark bandwagon is Intergraph, which willshow the ability to take a color image manipulated using DP/Studio and send adisplay file in Encapsulated PostScript format to Xpress for placement on apage.andP;  When the page is output, the high-resolution version is substitutedfor the display file.andM;Other products in the booth will include:andM;* The Edge II board for diplaying 32-bit CYMK files.andM;* The new 2000 workstation, introduced early in September, which runs at 12.5MIPS.andM;* Enhancements to software to handle masking, color calibration, and chokesand spreads.andM;* Interfaces to proofing devices.andM;* New facilities for calibrating the color monitor.andM;* The full line-up of DP/Publishing software--DP/Publisher 2.3 with anInterleaf translator, a DP/converter and DP/Batch for background processing;DP/Manager; DP/Paint; DP/Presenter; DP/Studio; and scanner capture software.andM;* New language capabilities for the Translator, which was introduced atDrupa.andP;  In San Jose, Intergraph will show English to Spanish, English toFrench and English to German, plus German to English and French to English.andM;Scitex America (2016)andM;Scitex will demonstrate the new products introduced during the spring, butthere won't be any products we haven't seen before.andP;  The exhibit will includethe Macintosh-based Visionary design/layout system and the VIP/2interpreter/translator of PostScript files, which we have described manytimes, plus some products from Drupa.andM;Star.andP;  The key new product from Drupa is the Star workstation--Scitex's firstmove to standard hardware.andP;  Star is a stripping station running on a PS/2Model 80 under AIX (Unix) with an X Window-based screen imaging model.andP;  Itoffers most of the features of the Assembler or MicroAssembler, but itdoesn't support density masking.andP;  It has the same window and menu structureas other Scitex workstations, so it should feel comfortable to operatorstrained on those machines.andP;  It connects to other Scitex workstations andcomputers via Ethernet.andM;SmarTwo.andP;  The SmarTwo desktop CCD scanner is based on Smart Scannertechnology, but it has a smaller input format and accepts onlytransparencies.andP;  After a quick scan, high-resolution scanning takes place inthe background.andP;  Multiple images can be scanned at different scaling androtation factors in the same pass.andM;MicroAssembler.andP;  The MicroAssembler dedicated page assembly workstation is anelement of the new First System.andP;  Functions include global color editing,page geometry, interactive tints, continuous-tone image positioning,automatic chokes and spreads, close crop masking, pixel cloning andvignettes.andM;Dolev PS.andP;  The Dolev PS internal-drum PostScript imagesetter, incorporatingan Adobe RIP, is aimed at a new generation of Scitex customers who need aquality PostScript imagesetter, but not necessarily a full Scitex system.andP;  Ituses a PS/2 computer to translate input and for a soft-copy preview.andM;Screen (DS) (1228)andM;Screen, as it is now known in the U.S., unveiled an impressive number of newproducts at Drupa, but it will have a different focus in San Jose.andP;  For thisevent, Screen will emphasize its increasing activities in the OEM market.andP;  Itwon't show the Omega network and some of the devices connected to it atDrupa, but it will demonstrate the system developed by Island Graphics.andM;Island Graphics' EPA, ECR.andP;  First shown at the Seybold Seminars in March andthen again at Drupa, the Electronic Page Assembly station and the ElectronicColor Retouching station were developed by Island Graphics, which is owned byDS.andP;  Both of them run on Sun Sparcstations.andP;  The EPA functions, which includeinteractive text composition, support two versions of software: one fordesign and one for production.andM;The ECR handles images from DS and other scanners and supports sophisticatedmasking, image merging and retouching.andM;Island will show its Write, Draw and Paint programs in its own booth.andM;Color scanners, recorders.andP;  Among the scanners and recorders on display willbe the ISC-2010 high-precision color input scanner and the IGR-2020PostScript color film recorder, OEM versions of the SG-2010/2020 units shownat ANPA (but not at Drupa).andP;  Both of these machines have SCSI interfaces andsoftware for the Macintosh II, which is intended to make them attractive toOEM customers.andP;  DS will show them connected to Macs running Xpress andPageMaker as an example.andM;The 2020 recorder differs from the other version in that DS has taken out thedot generator and replaced it with a Hyphen PostScript RIP.andP;  It uses amultiple-head, laser-diode exposure system and supports a maximum recordingarea of 24.1&quot; x 15.5&quot;.andM;Monochrome scanners.andP;  DS will show a brand-new monochrome CCD scanner calledthe ISM-301CF.andP;  Serving primarily to transfer images to the Macintosh, itsupports resolutions of 400 and 800 dpi and a format of 16.9&quot; x 11.6&quot;.andM;Also in the booth will be the SF-323 monochrome flatbed input/output scannerthat uses a CCD array for input and a helium-neon laser for output.andM;Tektronix/Dalim (2242)andM;Although it will have no new products of its own, Tektronix will show anenhanced version of Dalim's Litho color system, which it distributes in theU.S.andP;  Few details were available at press time, but added masking functionsand improved brush speed were among the expected improvements.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
