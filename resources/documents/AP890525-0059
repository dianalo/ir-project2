(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Script writing in Hollywood is thedomain of white men and with a shift toward young white men,according to a survey conducted by the Writers Guild of America.   The survey found female and minority writers and writers overage 40 receive fewer job offers and less pay for the meager scriptsthey can sell. The study was issued Wednesday by the Writers Guildof America, West.   The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers rebuttedthe survey, saying in a statement that it ``appears to containinaccurate information and certain of the conclusions do not appearto be supported by industry data.''   The producers' group also noted that more than 97 percent of theWGA's membership is white.   Richard Frank, president of the Disney Studios, also disputedsome of the findings of the WGA, which singled out Disney as havingthe worst record of hiring minority and female writers.   Frank admitted though that the company could improve itsminority hiring practices. ``I think we have to do better,'' hesaid. ``I think it's all of our problem and we should address it.''   The WGA leaders were less diplomatic, calling the pattern ofhiring prejudices morally repugnant.   ``The statistics contained in this report are simplyunacceptable,'' said Brian Walton, executive director of the WGAWest. ``Inaction in the face of these continuing realities would bea disgrace to our industry.''   The employment survey of WGA West's 6,400 members shows thatwomen writers earn 63 cents for every dollar collected by theirmale counterparts.   Minorities account for 2 percent of film and television authors,and older scriptwriters, once paid a premium for their screenplayexperience, now earn less than their younger colleagues, it said.   WGA Board Member Mort Thaw said it was ``inconceivable'' thatscriptwriting experience now ``should be considered a detriment toa career.'' He called the discriminatory hiring practices ``morallyrepugnant and legally accountable.''   Television programs not using any writers over age 40 were ``ThePopcorn Kid,'' ``St. Elsewhere,'' ``The Charmings,'' and``Moonlighting.'' By comparison, more than 85 percent of thewriters on ``Dallas,'' ``Dynasty'' and ``The Colbys'' were over age40.   Yet the WGA said it would not seek to remedy the situationimmediately with legal action. Walton said a class-action lawsuitagainst the studios would be expensive and perhaps ineffective.   At the same time, guild leaders said that the WGA's 1989Hollywood Writers Report reflected an irrefutable pattern of bias.A 1987 survey by the Screen Actors Guild concluded that limitedfilm and television casting of black and Hispanic actors did notreflect the ethnic mix of the United States.   ``Typically, you're going to find most of your black writers onblack shows,'' said Vida Spears, a black writer who sits on the WGAboard. ``You're just not called in to other shows.''   The study surveyed major film and network, syndicated and cabletelevision production from 1982 to 1987.</TEXT></DOC>
