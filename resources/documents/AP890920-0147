(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Hurricane Hugo on Wednesday did notappear to pose a major threat to this space center, but it onceagain delayed a satellite rocket launch and NASA said it was readyto move space shuttle Atlantis off a launch pad if the storm shiftedtoward the cape.   Officials put off from Sunday until Monday the launch of anAtlas-Centaur booster with a Navy communications satellite. Liftoffhad been set originally for Friday but that earlier was put off twodays after the rocket's fuel tank was drained as a Hugo precaution.   Space agency spokesman George Diller said the additional day'spostponement would give launch officials more time to assess Hugo'sdirection before ordering refueling of the Atlas-Centaur.   ``We're continuing to prepare both the shuttle and theAtlas-Centaur for launch, but we'll be ready to take protectivemeasures if the storm suddenly turns this way,'' said NASA spokesmanKarl Kristofferson.   Forecasters said if Hugo continued on its present northwestcourse it would pass at least 150 miles east of Cape Canaveral, notclose enough for its wide-ranging wind and rain to affect theshuttle or the Atlas-Centaur.   To prepare for a possible Atlantis move, workers parked a gianttracked transporter at the base of the launch pad to carry theshuttle to the safety of an assembly building. The transporter,moving at maximum speed of 1 mph, would take about six hours tocover the 4.2 miles to the building.   Atlantis is scheduled to be launched Oct. 12 with a crew of fiveastronauts who are to send the Galileo spacecraft on a six-yearjourney to the planet Jupiter.</TEXT></DOC>
