The Texas King of Torts did itagain, just as the Vice President was renewing his campaignto reform the lawyers.   Mr. Jamail's latest spin at the lottery wheel of Americanjustice is a good example of the excesses. He won a $550million judgment against MiniScribe Corp., $530 million of itin punitive damages, from a Galveston jury last week. This25-to-1 ratio of punitives to actual damages is typical of alegal system out of control, which is why Mr. Quayle wantsstates to limit punitives to an amount equal to the actualharm.</LP><TEXT>   MiniScribe is in bankruptcy, so much of the ruinousjudgment would be paid by its former accountants at Coopers andamp;Lybrand and former investment bankers at Hambrecht andamp; Quist --who point out they were also defrauded, for much more thanMr. Jamail's bondholder clients. It's also an irony that itwas an internal investigation by MiniScribe that uncoveredthe falsifying of records by some of its employees. So whomis the legal system punishing for what by assessing punitivedamages? The jury, by the way, decided Mr. Jamail should getsome $8 million for his labors.   Many lawyers are outraged by Jamail-style litigation, butthe American Bar Association as a trade group is too busycircling the wagons to see the absurdities. TalbotD'Alemberte, the group's president, called Mr. Quayle'scriticisms &quot;stupid, silly, preposterous, gratuitouslyinsulting and offensive.&quot; (Gratuitously?) His counterproposalis that the taxpayers provide &quot;full and adequate funding&quot; forthe Legal Services Corp., which subsidizes litigation bymaking direct payments to . . . lawyers.   The Access to Justice Act that Mr. Quayle proposed lastweek includes a limited federal application of what he callsthe Fairness Rule, which is also called the English Rule orthe Everywhere-but-America Rule. This would require thelosing side to pay the winning side's legal expenses. Thisshould deter abusive lawyering. A contingency-fee lawyerwould have a harder time getting defendants to settle casesfor some amount less than their legal expenses to defend thelawsuit. By the same token, defendants who know they areliable could no longer simply pay lawyers to use delayingtactics in the hopes of wearing down plaintiffs.   The Quayle proposal would protect consumers in lawsuitsagainst corporations. There is a provision that limits theamount of attorneys' fees that the losing side would have topay to the amount he spent on his own lawyers. Judges wouldhave broad discretion to award even less if the losing partyhas limited means. People with good legal claims would havebetter access to the courts because they'd know their legalfees would be compensated.   There is also a bill in Congress that would create newnational rules for product-liability litigation. This bill,which the nation's Governors unanimously support despitefederalism concerns, would begin to push the standard ofliability back to where it was before the liability explosion30 years ago. There would be a tighter definition of punitivedamages, and plaintiffs would no longer be able to go afterthe deepest pockets regardless of fault.   There is a problem with these reform proposals. AsPresident Bush noted in a recent speech, &quot;There are 62lawyers&quot; in the Senate. The trial lawyers are also majorfinancial contributors to Members of Congress. So the chancesof new legislation are small, especially if lawyers prefer toserve as targets for the Bush-Quayle campaign rather thanlead the reform themselves.</TEXT></DOC>
