Arab official and industry sources confirmed that in recent days, the Saudis have urged fellow OPEC members to refrain from giving discounts on oil prices and to let their production fall in order to reduce supplies of crude. The Saudis have also exhorted their OPEC allies to resist temptation to hold &quot;or even talk about holding,&quot; in the words of a well-placed OPEC official, any extraordinary meetings of OPEC that could suggest that the oil cartel is cracking under the pressure of falling oil prices.    &quot;Over the next three weeks this eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation will test OPEC. The outcome will affect the (oil) market for the remainder of the year,&quot; said Lawrence Goldstein, executive vice president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation of New York.    The Saudi hard line, strongly supported by Nigeria and Iran, follows pleas for help from beleaguered OPEC members in the wake of about a $3-a-barrel drop in oil prices since January. Some OPEC producers, especially tiny Qatar, said they are unable to sell their oil next month at anything close to the OPEC mandated official price of around $18 a barrel. For their part, the large multinational oil companies are pressuring OPEC by refusing to purchase new oil at official prices and drawing down their considerable inventories instead.    Senior OPEC officials estimate that OPEC production has fallen over the past two weeks by more than one million barrels a day, to about 15.8 million barrels a day, as oil companies join what has become known in the industry as a &quot;buyers' strike.&quot;    &quot;By and large OPEC is prepared to sit it out,&quot; said a senior OPEC minister who asked not to be identified. &quot;There may be some weaker members among us, but OPEC as a whole isn't overproducing. The problem is speculation by traders that verges on psychological warfare.&quot;    By far the largest drop in production has come in Saudi Arabia, which is producing only 3.8 million barrels a day, of which it is storing as much as one million barrels a day, according to Saudi sources. This means that &quot;real&quot; Saudi production isn't any more than 2.8 million barrels a day, well below its official OPEC quota of a little more than four million barrels a day. Production is also down in Nigeria, Iran, and Qatar.    OPEC officials and independent professionals agree that if the cartel holds out, the situation will be reversed within three to six weeks, with oil companies rushing to sign up for new supplies at higher prices.    Mr. Goldstein of the industry research foundation and other specialists say that at the start of the year, oil companies held well under 200 million barrels of surplus oil in stock, which they are now using up furiously and are expected to exhaust by the end of this month.    Meantime, oil prices fell on spot and futures markets yesterday for the fifth time in the past six sessions, as traders apparently shrugged off reports of the Saudi resolve. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil futures prices for April delivery, after falling to an intraday low of $16.17 a barrel, closed at $16.39, down 21 cents for the day. Heating oil contracts also fell, while unleaded gasoline futures prices were mixed.    The spot price of West Texas Intermediate, the major U.S. crude, slipped 20 cents, to $16.40 a barrel. And the March price of North Sea Brent, an abundantly traded European blend, fell 35 cents a barrel in late trading, to $15.85. </TEXT></DOC>
