Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substanceof the Proposed Rule Change</ITAG>The proposed rule change amends the NASD Board of Governor's Interpretationon Prompt Receipt and Delivery of Securities (the ``Interpretation'').The amendment would require members to make an affirmative determination,before effecting a short sale for their own accounts, that the securitywill be borrowed or delivered prior to the settlement date, except in certainspecified circumstances.The following is the complete text of the revised proposed rule change.Language added by Amendment No. 3 is italicized.(b) No member shall effect a ``short'' sale for its own account in anysecurity unless the member makes an affirmative determination that it canborrow the securities or otherwise provide for delivery of the securitiesby the settlement date. This requirement will not apply to transactionsin corporate debt securities, to bona fide market making transactions bya member in securities in which it is registered as a NASDAQ market maker,<T3>to bona fide market maker transactions in the non-NASDAQ securitiesin which the market maker publishes a two-sided quotation to an independentquotation medium,</T3> or to transactions which result in fully hedgedor arbitraged positions.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, andStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change</ITAG>In its filing with the Commission, the NASD Included statements concerningthe purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed anycomments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statementsmay be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD hasprepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of themost significant aspects of such statements.A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and StatutoryBasis for, the Proposed Rule ChangeOver the last several years, the NASD Board of Governors has adopted rulesproviding for additional regulation of short sale practices in the over-the-countermarket. In addition, it has amended its Interpretation on Prompt Receiptand Delivery of Securities to establish requirements for accepting customershort sale orders.The Interpretation currently prohibits members from accepting a short saleorder from a customer unless the member makes an affirmative determinationthat it will receive delivery of the security from the customer or thatit can borrow the security on behalf of the customer for delivery by settlementdate. The term ``customer,'' as defined in Article II, section 1(f) ofthe NASD Rules of Fair Practice, excludes brokers and dealers.The proposed rule change would impose a similar requirement upon memberseffecting short sales for their own accounts. Under the proposed rule change,a member would be prohibited from effecting a short sale for its own accountin any security unless the member makes an affirmative determination thatit can borrow the security or otherwise provide for delivery of the securityby the settlement date. The proposed amendment is intended to address unnecessaryspeculation in connection with the short selling of broker-dealers' proprietarypositions caused by the member's ability to go short without securitiesto cover the short position. The proposed amendment would not apply totransactions in corporate debt securities. It would also not apply to bonafide market making transactions by a member in securities in which it isregistered as a NASDAQ market maker, to bona fide market maker transactionsin non-NASDAQ securities in which the market maker publishes two-sidedquotations to an independent quotation medium, or to transactions whichresult in fully hedged or arbitraged positions. These latter exemptionshave been included to recognize that many short selling transactions areengaged in for risk reduction and market liquidity and to ensure theiravailability for bona fide purposes only.Amendment No. 3 to the original rule filing adds to the list of transactionsexempted from the requirement to make an affirmative determination thatdelivery can be made, market making transactions in non-NASDAQ securitiesfor which the member is publishing two-sided quotations to an independentquotation medium. The amendment is in response to comments received onthe original filing that argued that the market making exemption was toonarrowly drawn, applying as it did to NASDAQ securities only. The Boarddetermined that transactions in non-NASDAQ over-the-counter securitiesshould be afforded the exemption, provided the member was engaged in bonafide market making, as evidenced by its publication of a two-sided quotationsto a quotation medium, such as the ``pink sheets.''The NASD believes the proposed rule change is consistent with section 15A(b)(6)of the Act. In pertinent part, section 15A(b)(6) mandates that the rulesof a national securities association be designed to prevent fraudulentand manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principlesof trade, and to protect investors and the public interest, among otherthings. By requiring members to make an affirmative determination thatthey can borrow a security or otherwise provide for delivery of the securityprior to settlement date before effecting a short sale for their own account,the proposed rule change will enhance the integrity of the market, correctthe anomaly that now exists between the obligations of customers and members,and prevent abuses that harm public investors.B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on CompetitionThe NASD does not believe that the proposed rule change imposes any burdenon competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposesof the Act.C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the ProposedRule Change Received from Members, Participants, or OthersThe previous publication of the proposed rule change by the Commissionelicited several comments regarding the failure to include within the exemptionsbona fide market making transactions in non-NASDAQ over-the-counter stocks.The amended rule change is in response to such comments.<ITAG tagnum="85">III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timingfor Commission Action</ITAG>Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> or within such longer period (i) as the Commissionmay designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer periodto be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as towhich the NASD consents, the Commission will:A. by order approve such proposed rule change, orB. institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule changeshould be disapproved.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV.
