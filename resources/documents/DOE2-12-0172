<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-12-0172 </DOCNO><TEXT>We have used a pulsed electron beam in a scanning electron microscopeto produce highly localized ({similar_to}1 {mu}m) changes in the electricalproperties of a heterogeneous thin film of YBa{sub 2}Cu{sub 3}O/sub 7-//sub{delta}/ . The predominant effect of the beam is to locally heat thefilm, producing a measurable shift in the current-voltage characteristic.In particular, we have precisely located the part of the film responsiblefor a sharp feature in the current-voltage characteristic correspondingto a single Josephson junction. The technique should also be useful moregenerally in identifying specific weak links in superconducting thinfilms.</TEXT></DOC>
