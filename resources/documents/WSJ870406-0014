But the three-judge panel of the federal appeals court here left it up to the Federal Communications Commission to decide whether a refund is required and, if so, how much it should be.    The case involved the rates charged by local telephone companies for long-distance carriers and corporate users of private-line service. The case doesn't directly involve long-distance rates for consumers.    The dispute centered on increased rates first proposed by the local telephone companies in 1983, but blocked by the FCC for more than a year on the ground that the increase was too high. After several unsuccessful attempts to arrive at an acceptable increase, the FCC in November 1984 ordered an interim 20% rate increase. The FCC also ordered the local companies to submit another rate proposal, which was filed March 15, 1985, and took effect two weeks later, April 1.    The legal problem arose because of a 1975 settlement of a dispute between long-distance carriers and local telephone companies. The court-approved settlement required that rate increases take effect only after six months' notice and after enough information had been provided to justify them. </TEXT></DOC>
