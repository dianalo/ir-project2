Shareholders claim, in a motion to amend an existing lawsuit against the company, that the $24.60 offered for each share of common stock is inadequate. Allegheny, a manufacturing concern whose products include Sunbeam and Oster appliances, agreed to be acquired in a leveraged buyout by Sunter Holdings, a unit of the New York-based investment banking concern, in a transaction valued at about $500 million. Holders of Allegheny's $2.19 cumulative preference stock would get $20 a share and holders of the $11.25 convertible preferred stock would get $87.50 a share.    The motion for the amendment also states that one of the purposes of the buyout is to absolve defendants, including directors, of liability in the existing suit. The suit was filed last August in a federal court in Pittsburgh, alleging &quot;self-dealing, waste of corporate assets and grossly improper business decisions&quot; by some current and former management and directors.    Richard Greenfield, attorney representing one group of shareholders, said he plans to file a separate suit, also alleging that the price is too low, in Allegheny County Common Pleas Court.    Allegheny said it intends to oppose the motion. </TEXT></DOC>
