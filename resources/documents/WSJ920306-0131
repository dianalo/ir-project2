Klein</HL><DATE>03/06/92</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A7</SO><LP>   Any sporting event with the word &quot;The,&quot; capital T, in itstitle has gotta be important, and The Boat Race surelymeasures up. What boat race? you ask. Why, the one betweeneight-man crews representing the U's of Oxford and Cambridge,in England, of course. Now aren't you sorry you asked?   Weather permitting, and it almost always does because theBritish are stout about such things, the date of the next oneis April 4. The place is the River Thames in London betweenPutney Bridge and just past the Mortlake Brewery in Mortlake,a distance of 4 1/4 miles.</LP><TEXT>   There's a big-time sponsor in Beefeater gin, which givesthe two schools about $225,000 a year each for the privilegeof putting its name on the winner's trophy; Ladbrokes, thebetting-parlor chain, previously sponsored the race. Rememberthat the next time you want to complain about Virginia Slimsand women's professional tennis.   Are the Brits excited? You bet] Some 50,000 actual humansare expected to line the river's shores for the event, and 10million or so more will be watching at home, on the telly.I'm informed that The Boat Race is the third most popularannual live televised sporting event in the United Kingdom,behind only the FA Cup final (that's football; soccer,really) and the Grand National (that's a steeplechase).   But The Boat Race holds a special place in the hearts ofthe people whose sporting heirs we are, like it or not.That's because it bests those other two goes in a categorythe British truly hold dear, which is history. Whereas the FACup was inaugurated in 1872, and horses first jumped thehedges in the Grand National in 1847, The Boat Race datesfrom (gasp]) 1829. With interruptions for wars (WWs I andamp; II,Crimean, Boer, Roses) and other cataclysms, next month'sedition will be the 138th.   That first race, you'll be interested to know, wasorganized by Oxonian Charles Wordsworth, a nephew of thepoet. He was a kind of Don King of his day, having promotedthe first intra-U cricket match two years earlier.   The two crews met on the Thames at Henley on June 10,1829, and an estimated 20,000 people came to watch.Historians say the crowd gathered at least in part because anarticle in the Sporting Magazine -- hotly denied by theamateur contestants -- had reported that a side bet of 500pounds was at stake. Whatever, Oxford won. So, too, in a way,did the Church of England, because the crews would producetwo bishops, three deans and a chancellor of the Diocese ofManchester.   The race also is interesting nowadays, I think, because ofthe ways in which British intercollegiate sports differ fromour own. There is no equivalent of the NCAA in Great Britain,which makes everything a lot easier. Any student-graduate orundergrad -- can compete on any of his school's teams for aslong as he is enrolled.   Moreover, team members -- the &quot;kids,&quot; as it were -- callthe shots Over There in a way that would amaze but not amusethe likes of Bobby Knight. The coaches of both of the crewsare hired not by the universities but by the electedpresidents (i.e., captains) of their respective student boatclubs, and those young men also have a strong say in teamselection. Sounds to me like an educative experience.   There's some disagreement over whether British U's -- andCambridge and Oxford in particular -- recruit jocks. Oxfordhas won the race the past five years, and Max Justicz, theCambridge Boat Club president, claims that's partly becauseOxford's admission practices are &quot;receptive to athletes.&quot;   Not so, replies the Oxford Boat Club prez, Joe Michels.&quot;If anything, it's just the opposite,&quot; he asserts. &quot;Some ofour deans dislike the fuss that goes with the race, and giveus rowers a tough time.&quot;   If you discern an, uh, edge to the Justicz-Michelsrelationship, it's no accident. Michels is a 27-year-olddoctoral candidate in physics from around Washington, D.C.,who did his undergraduate work, and rowing, at La Salle inPhiladelphia. Law student Justicz, 24, is a British citizenwho nonetheless grew up around Atlanta and holds a degreefrom Boston U. They're acquainted, and near the end of lastyear's event, when it was clear Oxford would win, Michelsleaned from his craft and hollered, &quot;Bye, bye, Max.&quot;   We Yanks might consider that to be mild woofing, but theBritish press -- those scandalmongers] -- turned it into the&quot;Bye, bye, Max&quot; affair, and has quizzed the principals aboutit endlessly since. Says Michels: &quot;Not to justify what I did,but I thought they {the Cambridge crew members} were prettyarrogant before the race. There's no great friendlinessbetween us. &quot;Says Justicz: &quot;I thought his remark was a goodindicator of how they {the Oxford crew members} approachthings. To win, we'll have to match that.&quot;   Cambridge already has done a few things to get back intothe &quot;W&quot; column in a contest in which Oxford holds an overall69-67 victory margin, with one tie (in 1877). It has hired ascoaches John Wilson, who coached Oxford the previous fewyears, and, for a few weeks, Harry Parker, the noted HarvardU. crew mentor. Its coxswain (he's the guy who steers) willbe Andy Probert, a 37-year-old doctoral student who has coxedBritish crews in international competition. Coxing isespecially important in The Boat Race because of its long,bell-shaped course and variable tidal currents.   Oxford's coaches include Jurgen Grobler, a former EastGerman guru, and Mike Spracklen, of the Canadian nationalteam. Its boat includes a couple of British Olympic hopefuls.   The Boat Race is, indeed, serious business, with bothcrews putting in six-hour training sessions daily for theprevious five months. It's said that Cantabrigians exercisevigorously to keep warm, while Oxonians do it to stay awake,but the grind is no joke to President Justicz. &quot;On April 5, Ican resume having a social life. I hope,&quot; says he.</TEXT></DOC>
