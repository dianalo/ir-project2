Ray Vingo, the vice president for finance of the Seattle-based company.    Alaska Air is typical of companies discovering the leasing loophole in the new federal income-tax law. Collectively, they stand to save billions of dollars in taxes.    Congress expected that one of the law's provisions -- a new alternative minimum tax for corporations -- would generate at least $22 billion of added revenue over the next five years. But some tax analysts say that skillful use of leasing could easily cut that in half.    Now that the law is on the books, congressional and Treasury tax experts are registering surprise at how sharply leasing may cut into expected tax revenues. They warn that Congress could decide to close the loophole.    &quot;We don't know enough about it right now,&quot; a Treasury official concedes. &quot;But based on what we are hearing, we'll watch the trend. If it opens too many tax leaks, we'll have to plug the holes.&quot;    Meanwhile, major corporations such as United Technologies Corp., CSX Corp., Goodyear Tire andamp; Rubber Co. and Exxon Corp. are using or planning leasing arrangements to reduce taxes, although they prefer as little publicity as possible about the arrangements. &quot;Such tax information is a private matter,&quot; says Oren G. Shaffer, Goodyear's vice president and treasurer. &quot;Our tax attorneys tell us we really shouldn't talk about it.&quot;    But leasing brokers are rubbing their hands in glee. The new tax law is &quot;a great marketing tool&quot; for leasing, says Michael J. Fleming, the president of the American Association of Equipment Lessors, a trade group based in Arlington, Va. He says leasing volume may top $100 billion for the first time this year, up from $97 billion in 1986. Volume was only $15 billion as recently as 1975.    Corporations long have leased such assets as truck fleets and buildings. But because of the new tax law, leasing is spreading to other major assets like fiberoptics telephone lines, container ships, tire-making assembly lines, oil-drilling platforms and petroleum refineries.    Leasing can provide a tax loophole because of the new alternative minimum tax. Corporations have long been keeping two sets of books -- one using accounting rules for reporting financial results to shareholders and the other, typically showing much lower profits, to report to the Internal Revenue Service. But alternative-minimum-tax rules now call for a 20% tax on half the difference between income reported to shareholders and income reported to the Treasury. The alternative tax must be paid if its total is more than the regular tax of 34% under the new law.    When a company buys equipment, it uses straight-line depreciation for income reported to shareholders and accelerated depreciation for tax reporting. Accelerated depreciation makes for higher expenses and lower taxable income during the early years of an asset's life. This widens the gap between book and tax income; under the new law, it makes for higher taxes under the alternative minimum tax.    Leasing of equipment helps reduce the tax by preventing a gap between the two types of income. If a company buys $100 million in production equipment, it can deduct $20 million the first year under accelerated depreciation but only $10 million under straight-line depreciation. This creates a $10 million gap between income reported to shareholders and tax income. The bite from the alternative minimum tax, or AMT, on this $10 million gap is $1 million.    But if the company leases the equipment, it applies the same dollar deduction for rent on both sets of books; no gap is created.    &quot;Buying equipment is a sure-fire way to trigger the AMT trap,&quot; says Peter K. Nevitt, the chairman of BankAmerilease, a unit of BankAmerica Corp. in San Francisco.    &quot;Tax specialists have found ingenious techniques to get around the AMT through complex leasing arrangements,&quot; says William Raby, a senior tax partner with Touche Ross andamp; Co., a major accounting firm. &quot;Where there's a will, there's a way.&quot;    Because of the new tax law, BankAmerilease's Mr. Nevitt expects that assets leased by his company will rise more than 20% this year from the $15 billion in assets leased in 155 transactions last year.    Not surprisingly, critics of corporate tax avoidance are zeroing in on leasing. &quot;It's simply a sham tax shelter for big assets,&quot; asserts Robert S. McIntyre, the director of Citizens for Tax Justice, a coalition of labor and public-interest groups that monitors how corporations avoid taxes. &quot;Many of these new leasing deals have little economic substance.&quot;    BankAmerilease's Mr. Nevitt disagrees: &quot;If Congress looks at the structures of these new leasing arrangements, they'll find that they're perfectly legal as far as the lessor's title and the lessee's rental payments go,&quot; he says. &quot;Upsetting legitimate leasing will only undermine our economy and hurt the entire nation.&quot;    Still, the subject is sensitive with corporate America. This newspaper contacted dozens of companies and leasing brokers. Most companies took the advice of their tax attorneys and declined comment.    MCI Corp. is unhappy when it is asked about reports by leasing brokers that it plans to sell hundreds of miles of underground fiber-optic lines for $300 million to three other corporations and then lease back the lines to cut its income tax.    &quot;This is a tax-oriented transaction that we'd rather not discuss,&quot; a leasing executive at the telecommunications company says. &quot;It's not something we'll put in our annual report because we don't want the Internal Revenue Service jumping all over us. Don't mention it or we'll stop responding to your queries, since what we do with taxes is nobody's business unless we're required to disclose it in our financial statements.&quot;    Alaska Air Group's Horizon subsidiary is sub-leasing seven commuter planes from United Technologies of Hartford, Conn., which in turn is leasing the planes from a unit of Pacificorp Inc., a utility holding company in Portland, Ore. Alaska Air confirms the leasing plan, but United Technologies prefers a low profile in the matter. Harry Gill, an associate general counsel, says, &quot;It's not a good idea to talk about tax-oriented transactions.&quot;    Lawrence R. Appel, senior vice president of the Pacificorp unit, says that assets held by his company for &quot;tax-sensitive&quot; leasing will rise about 40% this year, to $200 million.    &quot;The tax law's AMT provisions have created a new industry with new players,&quot; Mr. Appel says. Pacificorp Inc., which owns Pacific Power andamp; Light Corp., acquired the leasing division late in 1985 from Orbanco Financial Services Corp. in Portland.    &quot;For every freight car we lease, we can save more than $1,000 in annual AMT taxes,&quot; says William H. Sparrow, the treasurer of CSX, which is getting back into leasing arrangements it used in the past.    &quot;Many people thought that new tax act was the death knell of leasing because it kills the investment tax credit and reduces depreciation benefits for the lessor, providing less benefits to pass along to the lessee,&quot; says Mr. Sparrow. &quot;But it hasn't turned out that way. If anything, the AMT will breathe new life into leasing.&quot;    CSX's Sea-Land Corp. subsidiary in Menlo Park, N.J., is negotiating the leasing of three huge container ships valued at $170 million from Argent Group Inc., a leasing firm based in New York City.    &quot;We're structuring a lot of leases to avoid AMT that our clients would prefer to keep quiet,&quot; says Stephen Gottlieb, Argent's managing director. &quot;Some of these deals will take a year or two to put together. I'd rather not alert tax authorities to how they're being done, or the deals will go up in smoke.&quot;    At Goodyear, Mr. Shaffer would only say that leasing is being looked at for various assets, including electronic engine analyzers for its 2,100 company-owned and franchised retail stores. He says Goodyear &quot;wouldn't lease any equipment unless it was an economically sound business decision.&quot; He adds, &quot;But there's no question we'd like to avoid the AMT trap.&quot;    Major international oil companies are considering certain leasing arrangements for the first time, to reduce taxes. The plans involve selling and leasing back refineries, pipelines and offshore-drilling rigs. Brokers say Exxon and Texaco Inc. are discussing such tactics with leasing brokers, but the companies won't comment.    Other new tax-law provisions besides the alternative minimum tax are influencing companies' buying and leasing decisions. Many multinational companies formerly bought equipment by borrowing in the U.S., as the interest costs were a fully deductible U.S. expense. The new law requires all subsidiaries filing a consolidated return to pro-rate interest expense to their U.S. and foreign operations, even if all the interest is paid in the U.S.    Rental expense, on the other hand, now can be allocated to the location of the rented property. Rental expense on equipment located in the U.S., therefore, can be fully deducted.    &quot;We can only say that we are beginning to look at sale-leasebacks for a wide range of U.S. assets&quot; to reduce U.S. taxes, says Stephen Arbogast, the treasurer of Exxon Capital Corp., a leasing and financing unit of Exxon Corp.    A Texaco spokeswoman denies that the company is using such leasing techniques.    Some U.S. companies will avoid leasing if they can retain some of their past tax benefits from owning assets. ITT Corp. in New York expects to continue to buy most production equipment, says Kathleen McCreary, a senior tax attorney.    &quot;We expect to be able to use the new tax law's depreciation schedules and investment tax credits still permitted us under transition tax rules for some years to come,&quot; Ms. McCreary says. &quot;Leases are long, complicated and cumbersome and involve a big fee to investment bankers plus the loss of residual value of the property.&quot;    Ms. McCreary says ITT likes the idea of &quot;owning a lot of our assets and thereby controlling their disposition.&quot;    Such preference for ownership, however, isn't putting much of a crimp in the business of leasing brokers. BankAmerilease is having the busiest first quarter in its history. Says Mr. Nevitt: &quot;We're normally slack this time of the year, but because of leasing volume to avoid the new tax act, six of our leasing specialists have had to cancel ski vacations.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
