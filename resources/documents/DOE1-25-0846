Research items for 1983and the results are as follows: 1) Study on the attached bacterial cellprocess Batch fermentation rate was tested for various materials indicatedthat the black sugar showed the same level of fermentation rate as thatof glucose. 2) Performance evaluation test: A test unit consisting oftwo acrylic resin fermentation vessels was made and data on its structurewas obtained. Fermentation test of cane black strap molasses withoutcooking gave the fermentation yield of 87 % and alcohol productivityof 27 g/1-h. 3) Manufacture of a test plant: A test plant of alcoholproduction with 100 1/d capacity was designed and manufactured in theplant of Ryukyu Seito Co., Okinawa Prefecture.
