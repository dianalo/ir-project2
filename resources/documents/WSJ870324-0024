The resignation yesterday of Mr. Brandt, 73 years old, followed a tempest of criticism over his choice of a 31-year-old Greek woman, Margarita Mathiopoulos, as party spokeswoman. Although a native of Bonn, Miss Mathiopoulos is not a West German citizen nor a member of the party. She withdrew her candidacy a few hours before Mr. Brandt's resignation.    The party's board nominated Hans-Jochen Vogel, leader of the party faction in Parliament, to succeed Mr. Brandt.    Mr. Brandt often proved to be a controversial elder statesman. He was critical of West Germany's alliance with the U.S. and a vocal proponent of disarmament. But he was respected widely for two achievements -- bringing West Germans to terms with their Nazi past and of pioneering &quot;Ostpolitik,&quot; a policy of rapprochement with the East for which Mr. Brandt won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1971.    Although Mr. Brandt was chairman of the party for 22 years, even party loyalists had begun to see him as a liability as they tried to rebuild after a series of election disappointments. </TEXT></DOC>
