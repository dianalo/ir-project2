Previous studies have indicated that it is technicallyand economically feasible to use a UCG process to obtain medium-heating-valuegas in the Illinois Basin and its vicinity. A reliable, predictive modelis needed to support the research and development of UCG. Modeling studiesare less expensive than field tests and they help researchers computethe process characteristics for a range of parameters and conditions.The concepts and approaches of developing a model for eastern coal arebased on existing models for western coal, while recognizing the differencesbetween the physical and chemical phenomena in the UCG of eastern andwestern coals. The interactions among different parts of a UCG systemand the irregular system dimensions are the major difficulties in solvingequations of a channel-type, thin-seam UCG model. Possible ways of resolvingthese difficulties are suggested and incorporated into the proposed model.55 refs., 15 figs., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
