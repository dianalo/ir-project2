It's a tale of two sons, born in Egypt and reared as Americans,and a personable American soldier of fortune the Egyptians say is aCIA agent.   It's a story the Egyptian government has made little fuss over,one the U.S. government has largely ignored.   To Beba Wassef, the mother, ``It's a nightmare.''   In mid-July, in a 90-minute trial without witnesses, a securitycourt convicted Samy Wassef, 26, and his brother, Samir, 30, ofspying for the United States. Each was sentenced to 10 years inprison and fined 10,000 Egyptian pounds ($3,850).   The prosecutor said their crime was agreeing with a foreignintelligence agency to sell information from newspapers and othersources about Moslem fundamentalism, Moslem-Christian relations,Egypt's economy and other topics.   Samir, a pediatrician, is in the United States. Samy is inprison.   Also sentenced was Nicholas Edward Reynolds, who left Egypt inthe fall of 1987. Friends knew him as a maker of travel films basedin California; he was identified at the trial as the Wassefs'Central Intelligence Agency spymaster.   Security police knocked on Samy Wassef's door Nov. 14 and``invited'' him to accompany them for questioning. He had graduatedfrom the Cairo University medical school and was about to return tothe United States.   Samy was held in a prison south of Cairo for eight months,uncharged despite a confession, which he said investigatorsessentially fabricated. He had occasional visits from family,consular officials and lawyers.   Little has changed since the trial, except that Egypt considershim a convicted traitor.   Beba Wassef calls her son ``the forgotten American.''   Mrs. Wassef, who has heart problems and high blood pressure, istrying to change that. She said she spent months quietly asking forhelp from the Egyptian and U.S. governments. Now she is shouting.   ``All these months I trusted the Americans. I felt secure thatthey were helping Samy,'' she said. ``Yesterday I learned thetruth. An embassy official admitted nobody has discussed Samy'scase with the Egyptian government. All these months!   ``He's rotting in jail. His life is ruined. His career isruined. His health is deteriorating.   ``And the Americans have never brought it up?''   She said she was told one problem for the U.S. government isthat Egypt considers her son Egyptian, not American.   That, she said, is ``rubbish.''   ``Samy entered Egypt on an American passport, which has beentaken away by Egypt,'' his mother said.   ``He is an American. He feels like an American. He lovesAmerica. He came here to study medicine, but that doesn't mean heleft his citizenship at the airport.''   When Mrs. Wassef visited the U.S. Embassy on Sunday, as she doesalmost daily, she quoted President Bush's weekend statement aboutJoseph Cicippio, an American hostage in Lebanon whose kidnapperssuspended a death sentence against him last week.   ``He said that just being an American is enough for yourpresident, the senators, everybody to care about you,'' she said.``He mentioned a big, loving family in Norristown, Pa., that'seating its heart out.   ``I can understand that, because we have a big, loving family inDetroit that's doing the same. But nobody cares about Samy.''   The embassy's position has been that the Wassefs receive``normal consular services.'' It said the ``embassy supports anyaction Mrs. Wassef feels she must take to help her son.''   On Monday, embassy spokeswoman Marcelle Wahba said: ``Theembassy will not issue statements, because the matter is underlegal consideration.'' Requests for interviews with consularofficials were denied.   In Washington, Rep. William Broomfield's office said theMichigan Republican had urged the State Department and Egyptianofficials to get Samy Wassef released, spokesman Bob Jenkins said.   ``We're going to do everything we can to win Sami's freedom andget him back to Michigan,'' said a spokesman, Bob Jenkins.   He said Broomfield, ranking Republican on the House ForeignAffairs Committee, had written to President Hosni Mubarak and AbdulRaouf el Reedy, Egypt's ambassador to the United States.   A congressional source said Egypt was sensitive about the caseand wanted it handled quietly. The source said an Egyptian courtwas expected to review it soon.   The Wassefs say Samy and Samir met Reynolds several years ago,when Reynolds asked them to contribute information for Cairo Today,an English-language magazine.   Reynolds, who had been educated at impressive universities inthe United States and England, kept a low profile in Cairo.   He told acquaintances he made documentary films while workingfor Sobek, a travel and adventure company based in Oakland andAngel's Camp, Calif. Sobek employees told The Associated Press hehad worked for the firm several years ago, but that Sobek had losttrack of him.   The main evidence presented at the trial was Samy's 253-pageconfession, which included details of spy activities and trainingin a secret American spy school. It was written in Arabic, whichMrs. Wassef says her son reads poorly.   ``Except for a couple of pages, the whole thing was fantasy,''she said. ``To understand why Samy signed it is to understand hiscondition. He had been locked up without legal or consular help. Hehad been showed pictures of ropes, torture victims, things likethat.   ``They told him his luggage was outside with a ticket home. Allhe had to do for freedom was to sign that paper. And he did.''   She said the confession was signed before the first visit to herson Dec. 8 by Conrad Drescher, the U.S. consul general. Embassysources say Drescher now visits every two weeks.   ``We've spent all our money, our time since November, trying todo something,'' Mrs. Wassef said. ``I had to leave our small son inMichigan. I've missed his birthday, my husband's birthday. Ourfriends and relatives in Michigan have sent letters. ... All thistime, and the American Embassy didn't do anything?''   The family has averaged a telephone call to the embassy everyother day for most of the time her son has been in jail, she said.   ``What do they think we all were calling for, just to hear theirvoices?'' Samy Wassef's mother asked. ``We were desperate for help,and who does an American turn to for help but to his embassy?''</TEXT></DOC>
