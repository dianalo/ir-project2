Ricks (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> SCR STK </IN><G> SEC </G><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Securities and Exchange Commission, in an unusual case, charged a former managing director of Morgan Grenfell Securities Ltd. and his former broker in Los Angeles with insider trading.    The allegations in the SEC case repeat those already made by British authorities. But the case is significant because it involves inside trading by a foreigner in foreign companies traded on a foreign stock exchange.    The U.S. connection in the case is that Geoffrey Collier, the former Morgan Grenfell official, executed his trades through a U.S. brokerage firm. &quot;He's sitting in London, misappropriates information from his firm, and calls a U.S. broker-dealer in Los Angeles to avoid detection in London,&quot; said Harry Weiss, an SEC attorney involved in the case.    Asked if the SEC case against Mr. Collier was unprecedented, Joseph Mari, an attorney in the agency's international legal assistance office, said: &quot;I'm not aware of another case like it, but there may be.&quot;    Mr. Collier, once a leading figure in London's securities markets, admitted to the SEC's allegations and consented to an injunction ordering him to refrain from further violations of securities laws. He didn't profit from his inside trades in Cadbury Schweppes PLC and Associated Engineering PLC, and therefore hadn't any profits to disgorge.    Mr. Collier began buying call options in Cadbury in October 1986, after learning that General Cinema Corp., which Morgan Grenfell represented, was contemplating an acquisition. That trading might have proved profitable, but on Nov. 6 -- after Mr. Collier's other trading had aroused suspicions but before General Cinema's intentions were made public -- Mr. Collier sold the options at a loss of $21,000, according to the SEC's complaint.    The transactions that led to Mr. Collier's downfall were his purchases of Associated Engineering shares Nov. 3, 1986, one day after he learned that Hollis PLC planned to acquire the company. Mr. Collier bought 60,000 shares, selling them shortly after the Hollis bid was announced for a potential profit of #15,000 (about $26,000). But a firm on the other side of the purchase complained, leading to an inquiry and a subsequent reversal of the transaction.    The SEC's case, filed in a federal court in Los Angeles, also is unusual because the agency didn't bar Mr. Collier from the securities industry, an action it frequently takes against industry members who engage in insider trading. Mr. Weiss, the SEC attorney, said the agency didn't do that for several reasons. He said that Mr. Collier has been out of the business since his trading was disclosed two years ago, that he cooperated fully, and that he didn't profit.    In addition, Mr. Collier pleaded guilty to insider trading charges in London last year and received a #25,000 fine and a suspended one-year jail sentence. He was also ordered to pay #7,000 in court costs. His case was the first brought under a 1985 British insider-trading law.    Mr. Collier, who now resides in New York, referred all questions to his attorney Howard Schiffman, who said that &quot;Mr. Collier is gratified that he is now able to make a fresh start in the securities industry.&quot;    Michael Cassell, Mr. Collier's broker, also was charged in the case, although in hazier terms. According to the SEC's complaint, Mr. Casell, then an employee of Vickers da Costa Securities Inc., either knew or should have known that Mr. Collier was trading on inside information. The complaint said the two men had both worked at Vickers in New York, and had remained close friends.    Unlike Mr. Collier, Mr. Cassell neither admitted nor denied the SEC's allegations. But he consented to an injunction against future violations of the securities laws.    Mr. Cassell wasn't barred from the securities industry, either. He couldn't be reached for comment, and a person answering the telephone at Vickers's Los Angeles office said Mr. Cassell hasn't worked there for two years. His attorney, Ronald DePetris, declined to say what Mr. Cassell is doing now.    Mr. DePetris said Mr. Cassell settled the case to avoid &quot;the substantial cost of litigation.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
