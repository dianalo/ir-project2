But the Chrysler chairman's recent characterization of theobstacles to selling Cherokees in Japan appears to stretchthe truth.</LP><TEXT>   In a blunt speech to members of the Detroit Economic ClubFriday, made just hours after he returned from Tokyo, Mr.Iacocca railed against the criticism that poor quality andlack of effort are the real reasons Detroit's Big Three don'tsell more cars in Japan. &quot;They say our stuff is junk, but Idon't think so,&quot; he fumed.   &quot;I wonder if there's another reason. Like maybe because myJeep Cherokee costs $12,000 more in Japan than it does herebecause they won't accept our certification, and everythinghas to be inspected and there's a maze of red tape notdesigned to protect the Japanese consumer, but to keep usout,&quot; he said.   Mr. Iacocca is right about the big difference in price; hemay even be understating it. Cherokees in Japan carry asticker price of 5.2 million yen, or more than $40,000.   That is much more than the $22,300 the vehicles sell forin the U.S. -- and more than what all but a handful ofJapanese consumers will shell out for a car made by a companywhose quality standards most regard with suspicion.Comparable Japanese four-wheel-drive vehicles, includingMitsubishi Motors Corp.'s popular Pajero or Toyota MotorCorp.'s Land Cruiser, sell here for $7,000 less thanCherokees.   But the &quot;red tape&quot; associated with certification andinspection of Cherokees accounts for only a small part of theprice difference. Even by estimates of officials at ChryslerJapan Sales Corp., the Detroit car maker's Tokyo distributor,meeting Japanese requirements for emissions, safety featuresand the like account for less than $1,000 in extra cost.   In fact, Mr. Iacocca may have been closer to the mark lastyear, when in a syndicated newspaper column he pointed tohigh distribution costs as a factor in the higher prices.While describing the price increase that results when JeepCherokees are shipped across the Pacific as &quot;an even biggermystery&quot; than the Bermuda Triangle, Mr. Iacocca acknowledgedthat distribution costs account for about 70% of thedifference.   Mr. Iaccoca's June column contended that distributioncosts in Japan are high because &quot;the major Japanese carcompanies won't let their dealers handle American cars.&quot; Forthe most part, that's true, despite disingenuous claims byJapan's dealers that the only reason they never sold U.S.cars before is that no one asked them to.   But the tight relationship between the big Japanese carmakers and their dealer networks doesn't mean it isimpossible to sell imported cars here at a competitive price.European manufacturers such as BMW, Volkswagen and Rover haveshown they can price their cars competitively here, either bybuilding their own dealer networks or working withindependent dealerships. But to cut its distribution costs,Chrysler would have to slice profit margins and accept lossesfor years, something its precarious financial positionprevents it from doing.   One big component of high costs for operating dealershipsin Japan is astronomical land prices. But it can hardly beargued that those high prices are barriers erected by theJapanese to shut out foreign competitors. The Europeanmanufacturers who operate cost-efficient dealerships in Japanwere lucky enough to purchase property in the early 1980sbefore the so-called bubble economy sent Japanese land pricessoaring.   Probably the biggest reason costs are high at Chrysler'sJapan dealerships is that the company's sales volume is sosmall. The result is Chrysler dealers must charge high pricesfor Jeeps to recover the overhead they pay for such things assalaries, servicing and rent. Without much hope for big salesvolumes, none of the Big Three U.S. car makers has beenwilling to invest the enormous sums that would be necessaryto build full-fledged, independent dealerships in Japan.Despite those major obstacles, however, Mr. Iacocca chose tofocus on the &quot;red tape&quot; issue.   Meanwhile, Japan's drivers are hardly clamoring forCherokees. While a few loyalists are fond of wheeling thebulky vehicles through Tokyo's narrow streets, the Cherokeesshipped to Japan last year were plagued with defects.Chrysler recalled the vehicles three times, twice for brakedefects and once for throttle problems.   Officials at Honda Motor Corp., which has sold 395Cherokees in the past two years, say the recalls and a rashof other maintenance problems have undermined the relativelypositive image the vehicle enjoyed among Japan's off-roadenthusiasts before the car had wide exposure here. Honda nowhas more Cherokees in storage than it sold all last year.   Honda's troubles in marketing Cherokees in Japan only makeclear that there is risk as well as opportunity inherent inthe agreements President Bush negotiated with the Japaneseauto industry in Tokyo last week. After considerablearm-twisting from Washington and Japan's powerful Ministry ofInternational Trade and Industry, Honda last week agreed toincrease its annual sales of Cherokees and Wranglers to 1,200vehicles by 1995.   The arrangement was part of an effort aimed at bluntingU.S. complaints that Japan's domestic distribution system isclosed to outsiders. It should allow Chrysler to increasesales without a proportional jump in its overhead costs.   To make good its pledge, Honda plans to triple the numberof its dealers that sell Jeeps to 300 and pour additionalresources into its Jeep customer-service team, says YoshihideMunekuni, Honda's vice president in charge of domesticmarketing. But because sales volume is small, Honda is leeryof spending large sums on advertising; it will rely insteadon satisfied Cherokee owners to spread the word. Hondaofficials hope to allay customers' concerns about quality byselling the American vehicles based on its own willingness tobend over backward on service.   &quot;We said we'll sell that many, so we'll sell that many,&quot;said Mr. Munekuni. &quot;But whether {the sales target} makessense as a business proposition is another story.&quot; Honda'sefforts should get a lift in October or November, whenChrysler is scheduled to unveil a long-awaitedright-hand-drive version of the Cherokee developed for theJapanese market.   Whether Honda's attempt to sell Jeeps by strengthening itsown customer-service division will prove of any long-termbenefit to Chrysler -- or only leave the company moredependent on outside assistance once the three-year period isover -- remains to be seen. Indeed, Mr. Iacocca's statementsbefore and after his Tokyo visit indicate he thinks the oddsof competing in Japan are hopelessly stacked against hiscompany.   While Mr. Iacocca's hawkish rhetoric didn't do much forCherokee's image in Japan, there is one area where the U.S.business delegation's visit seems to have had a positiveeffect on sales: Chrysler Japan officials say they've beenbesieged with calls from Japanese wanting to buy the 20limited-edition Cherokees used last week by President Bush'sentourage.</TEXT></DOC>
