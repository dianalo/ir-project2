The 6,008 arrivals at a Vienna transit center were the biggestoutflow since the Intergovernmental Committee on Migration begankeeping monthly figures in 1979, ICM spokeswoman Regina Boucaultsaid Monday.   The latest exodus, which was more than three times the August1988 rate, brought the 1989 total to 30,141.   Only 127 of the Jews traveling through Vienna went on directly toIsrael in August, Boucault said. Most are going to the United States.   The committee's latest monthly figures were lower than thoseannounced Friday in Washington by the National Conference on SovietJewry. The U.S. group said 6,756 Soviet Jews emigrated last monthand 793 went to Israel.   Boucault said the total figure apparently reflects the number ofSoviet Jews arriving in the United States, which could includemigrants who were counted when they arrived in Western Europe inprevious months.   Those reported as settling in Israel may include Jews who wentthere via Bucharest rather than Vienna and are not monitored by theIntergovernmental Committee on Migration, she said.   Some 300,000 Soviet Jews have emigrated since the resettlementprogram began in 1971. The largest official exodus, 51,328, wasrecorded in 1979, before the Soviet intervention in Afghanistanchilled East-West relations.</TEXT></DOC>
