The unit, Beneficial New York Inc., denied the charges.&quot;We're confident we're within New York state regulations,&quot;said Robert Wade, a company spokesman. &quot;I can't say anythingbeyond that because I haven't seen the complaint,&quot; he added.</LP><TEXT>   The suit, filed in state supreme court in Rochester,charges that Beneficial mailed unsolicited checks toconsumers around the state for up to $1,500, urging they becashed immediately.   According to Attorney General Robert Abrams and BankingSuperintendent Jill Considine, the documents Beneficialmailed to consumers stated that by cashing the check theyagreed to repay the loan. State officials charge thatBeneficial deceived customers by calling the interestpayments on the loan &quot;low,&quot; when in practice the ratescharged would be 25%. Under New York state law the maximumrate allowed is 25%, or about double most conventional bankloans.   Mr. Abrams said he is asking the court to suspendrepayment of the loans and to bar Beneficial from continuingits marketing campaign.   The Beneficial spokesman said the company would wait tosee the complaint before it decided on a course of action.</TEXT></DOC>
