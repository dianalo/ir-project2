Thestudy is intended to develop an automatic artificial facility cultivationsystem of energy saving type utilizing electric power generated fromsolar cells as a power source for a ventilation and irrigation system(no heating) or a ventilation, irrigation and heating system (heatingby application of the underground heat). In order to design an artificialfacility cultivation house of an stand-alone type, firstly, a surveywas carried out on (1) the situation of the currently available houseinstallations, etc. (2) the existing data on temperature, insolationand operating conditions, etc. and (3) the selection of units to be applied.Subsequently, a simulation on the heat balance in and out of the house,and a basic design were performed. As a result of the study, in so faras the artificial facility cultivation system based on photovoltaic powerconcerned, it was found that its application to the air ventilation andirrigation system of non-heating type is worth recommending since itsapplication to heating costs significantly more and becomes difficult.(1 tab)</TEXT></DOC>
