Mr. Richardson knew that if he flunked one more urine test, he would be banished from the NBA for at least two years. Yet even with a $3 million contract with the New Jersey Nets on the line, Mr. Richardson tested positive for cocaine in 1986.    &quot;Richardson couldn't say no for $3 million,&quot; says Mr. Grantham, who was the player's agent at the time. &quot;If testing is a disincentive, then on its face it didn't serve the purpose.&quot; (Mr. Richardson has since recovered and been certified as clean by the NBA; he is playing in Europe.)    For all the recent debate over drug testing and all the enthusiasm among employers, there is only a trickle of evidence that it deters drug use. In cases where testing seems to have benefits, it's difficult to factor out all the other anti-drug forces also at work.    Some employers consider drug testing useful, if only as a way to avoid hiring addicts. And in unusual environments -- such as the military or the parole system -- testing seems to deter drug use. But it's far less clear whether the broad use of drug testing would reduce drug use nationally -- or whether it would simply make addicts unemployable.    The National Institute on Drug Abuse says it knows of no studies that have examined the deterrent effect of random, surprise drug testing, the most controversial kind. Mark Rothstein, a drug-testing specialist at the University of Houston Law School, says, &quot;There's very little hard data that drug testing is effective -- that it has resulted in savings in terms of reducing accidents, absenteeism or health-care expenditures.&quot; The American Society for Clinical Pharmacology said in a position paper last year that &quot;adequate scientific studies of the relationship among safety, productivity, drugs of abuse and testing of urine aren't available or haven't been done.&quot;    Despite the uncertainty, public and private employers are embracing testing. A Labor Department survey last year found that one-fifth of all private-sector employees work for a company that conducts drug testing of some sort. President Bush's new anti-drug strategy calls for testing federal employees and encourages other employers to test &quot;where appropriate.&quot; Federal contractors may be compelled to adopt testing policies or risk losing their government contracts.    As testing takes on a bigger role in the workplace, at least some questions are getting resolved. The courts are clarifying the complex legal issues. The care with which tests are conducted is improving, although eating a poppy-seed bakery roll can still sometimes cause a subject to test positive for heroin. The federal government has also begun a process to certify testing laboratories that it finds reliable.    But the weighing of costs and benefits is only beginning. The costs can add up: A simple screening test costs $17 to $25, and confirming a positive test with more accurate equipment -- a step recommended by most specialists -- costs an additional $50 to $75.    Though evidence of benefits remains sketchy, many employers remain convinced of the merits of drug testing -- at least as part of a broader corporate strategy. International Business Machines Corp., cited as a model in the Bush drug plan, has been testing all applicants since 1984. In 1986, it set a policy of testing employees with &quot;unexplained changes in behavior on the job&quot; if company doctors so recommended. Those who test positive must undergo treatment to keep their jobs and must agree to frequent tests when they return to work.    &quot;We do think it works. We probably have screened out some problems,&quot; says Philip Shellhaus, an IBM program manager. But IBM can't prove that the program has actually discouraged drug use. &quot;Can we say we have {fewer} employees showing up with drug problems?&quot; Mr. Shellhaus asks. &quot;We don't have the statistics to back that up.&quot;    The deterrent effect of drug testing may be strongest in some unusual environments, such as the parole system and the military. Use of drugs among uniformed military personnel plunged after the Pentagon in 1981 began vigorously enforcing its &quot;zero tolerance&quot; policy and conducting surprise tests of all ranks. In anonymous surveys, the percentage of personnel saying they had recently used drugs fell to 4.8% last year from 19% in 1982 and 27.6% in 1980. Three-quarters of the more than 18,000 troops responding to the latest survey said urine testing reduces drug use in the military.    &quot;I don't know how much {of the decline} is due to leadership as opposed to the threat of punishment from random drug testing,&quot; says Stephen Duncan, an assistant secretary of defense who oversees the Pentagon anti-drug effort. But, he adds, &quot;our military commanders say our random-urinalysis testing is the single most important factor.&quot;    The military experience, however, is hard to translate to the civilian sector. The military has sure and swift penalties for drug use, and more control over its personnel than most other employers. &quot;The deterrent effect is just incredible in that unaddicted, socially compliant group,&quot; says Douglas Anglin, a psychologist at the University of California at Los Angeles. &quot;It isn't going to have the same effect in inner cities.&quot;    Some employers notice fewer accidents and other favorable signs after they begin testing, and these cases are cited by testing advocates. But the employers themselves say they aren't sure how important the tests are. After Southern Pacific Transportation Co. began post-accident testing in 1984, the company's rate of railroad accidents blamed on human failure dropped to 8.1 for every million miles in 1985 from 22.2 in 1983; it since has fallen to 2.2. &quot;We think testing was clearly a part of it, but it's hard to prove,&quot; says spokesman Andrew Anderson. &quot;It went along with other safety programs.&quot;    Evidence is stronger that companies benefit by not hiring drug users in the first place, though it isn't clear whether pre-employment testing helps them achieve this goal. In the largest reported study of its kind, the U.S. Postal Service took urine samples from 5,465 job applicants, although it didn't use the results in making hiring decisions and didn't tell local managers of the findings.    When in-house psychologist Jacques Normand checked six months to a year later, workers who had tested positive turned out to be absent 41% more often and to be fired 38% more often. Overall turnover, however, was the same because non-users were more likely to quit voluntarily than users. Even after adjusting for differences of age, sex and race, Mr. Normand found that pre-employment drug testing proved a significant predictor of an employee's reliability. The Postal Service is now implementing pre-employment drug tests nationwide.    A hospital in Georgia, however, stopped pre-employment drug testing after a small study it sponsored found no significant link between test results and job performance. &quot;A couple of years later, it started {testing} again,&quot; says David Parish, a professor at Mercer University Medical School in Atlanta who conducted the recently published study but agreed not to name the hospital. &quot;They felt they had to do their part in the war against drug use,&quot; he says.    Employers that test applicants are finding that fewer test positive than in the recent past. For example, only 2% of Chevron Corp.'s applicants test positive today; a few years ago, before it required testing, a study of applicants found that one in three job seekers tested anonymously produced a positive result.    But the significance of this trend isn't clear. It may simply prove that applicants who use drugs casually have figured out that they need only abstain for a couple of weeks to pass the tests. &quot;Some employers,&quot; says Mark DiBernardo, director of labor law at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, &quot;refer to them as IQ tests.&quot;    ---@ Testing Job Applicants @ TOTAL @ TESTED PCT. @ INDUSTRY (in thousands) POSITIVE @ TOTAL 3,913.7 11.9% @ Mining 72.0 12.7 @ Construction 326.6 11.9 @ Manufacturing @ Durable goods 767.6 11.2 @ Nondurable goods 1,106.5 12.7 @ Transportation 451.8 9.9 @ Communications, @ utilities 143.5 5.5 @ Wholesale trade 260.5 17.4 @ Retail trade 169.7 24.4 @ Finance, insurance @ and real estate 308.4 6.7 @ Other services 306.2 9.9 @ Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics </TEXT></DOC>
