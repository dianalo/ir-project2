Seib (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jesse Jackson, often accused of being light on details, doesn't lack specifics in his national-security proposals.    He would freeze the Pentagon budget for five years, meaning spending would fall by billions when adjusted for inflation. He would drop the MX, D-5 and Midgetman nuclear missiles, stop development of the Stealth bomber and end production of the Pentagon's newest transport plane and possibly its most advanced jet fighter.    Then, aides say, Mr. Jackson would press the Soviets for deep arms cuts.    In short, the Democratic presidential candidate proposes a program that would drastically alter the U.S.'s defense posture. The U.S. would retain a substantial nuclear arsenal, but one that critics contend would grow increasingly vulnerable to Soviet attack.    Mr. Jackson essentially would gamble that the Soviets are so eager to ease their own defense-spending burden that they would negotiate arms cuts even after the U.S. dropped some big weapons systems unilaterally. And Mr. Jackson's plans to reduce U.S. troop levels in Western Europe and cut aircraft carriers mean the U.S. would adopt a lower international military profile.    &quot;What we say is we can cut our defense budget without cutting national security,&quot; says Robert Borosage, a senior Jackson adviser. &quot;The notion of freezing the budget means cuts will take place over time. We're not committed to massive cuts immediately.&quot;    But many analysts, noting that inflation-adjusted defense spending already has declined over the past three years because of budget pressure, dispute the Jackson analysis.    &quot;You're not going to get major new savings without cutting into the guts of our defense capability,&quot; says Anthony Cordesman, adjunct professor of national security studies at Georgetown University. &quot;Ultimately, what Jesse Jackson really says when you add it up is he doesn't believe the U.S. should play the role of a superpower.&quot;    Mr. Jackson's program also would have a significant domestic impact. Billions of defense dollars would be freed so they could be shifted to create new jobs in areas such as education and housing. But at the same time, thousands of defense workers from Los Angeles to Long Island probably would have to find new jobs.    Other Democrats adopt some of the same proposals Mr. Jackson endorses, such as scaling back research on the &quot;Star Wars&quot; strategic defense initiative. And Mr. Jackson and his aides say that even Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci acknowledged after taking over the Pentagon last year that defense officials see ways that spending can be cut. But nobody else proposes the same broad array of changes or asserts as flatly that President Reagan wasted billions in his big defense buildup.    Perhaps the most abrupt change Mr. Jackson would make is in the Reagan plans for building strategic nuclear weapons. Mr. Jackson proposes dropping the newest weapon Mr. Reagan has started in each &quot;leg&quot; of the U.S. strategic triad of land, sea and air-launched systems.    On land, Mr. Jackson wouldn't build any more MX missiles and would scrap the experimental Midgetman missile, a mobile missile currently in limbo in Pentagon plans. In the air, he would stop the Stealth bomber. And at sea, he would drop the D-5 submarine-launched nuclear missile, a weapon that is popular with most members of Congress but is called destabilizing by some, who contend it would allow the U.S. to launch a first strike to take out Soviet land-based missiles.    Mr. Jackson argues that these systems are unnecessary because of earlier Reagan-era strategic modernization programs. He says the 50 MX missiles now being built, along with new B-1 bombers, B-52 bombers upgraded to carry cruise missiles and existing C-4 submarine-launched missiles, give the U.S. an adequate strategic arsenal.    &quot;A Jackson nuclear force in 1993 will be just as strong as Ronald Reagan's right now,&quot; Mr. Borosage says.    But military analysts argue that such a program would leave the U.S. with a strategic mix that would be dated and vulnerable to Soviet attack because it wouldn't include new mobile missiles or the radar-eluding Stealth bomber.    The U.S. would be &quot;first and foremost in a position with increasingly vulnerable U.S. forces and fairly invulnerable Soviet ones,&quot; says R. James Woolsey, who was undersecretary of the Navy in the Carter administration. &quot;That puts you in a very difficult position in which to negotiate with the Soviets if that's what you want to do.&quot;    In conventional forces, Mr. Jackson would save money by stopping production of the C-17 troop transport plane and has endorsed ending production of the F-15 jet fighter. The C-17 is the Pentagon's newest transport plane, but Mr. Borosage maintains that the older C-5 transport plane and more troop-carrying ships would suffice.    Robert Komer, undersecretary of defense in the Carter administration, strongly disagrees. As he says he argued during his Pentagon tenure: &quot;The Achilles' heel of our defense program was the lack of ready airlift. What's the point of having 16 or 17 divisions if you can only deliver them one at a time?&quot;    The F-15 is the Air Force's top-of-the-line jet fighter, and its most expensive one. Mr. Borosage says the Jackson program would call for relying on the less expensive F-16, or reducing purchases of both the F-15 and F-16 if both programs continued.    Mr. Jackson also proposes scaling back to 12 aircraft carriers, the number the U.S. had before the Reagan administration, from the 15 now in service or in the works. Many Democrats agree that the expensive carriers the Reagan administration added weren't all necessary, although Prof. Cordesman of Georgetown argues that 12 would be too few to &quot;perform the role of a world power.&quot;    Mr. Jackson also would reduce the 325,000 U.S. troops in Europe. Mr. Borosage says a Jackson administration would withdraw 65,000 troops over five years and hope through negotiations with the Soviets to arrange the withdrawal of &quot;significantly more.&quot; Other Democrats as well as Republicans agree that the U.S. can scale back its commitments to prosperous allies, and some propose even sharper cuts than Mr. Jackson.    Mr. Jackson's changes could have big domestic economic implications as billions of dollars are shifted from defense to other areas. Gordon Adams, director of a nonpartisan research organization called the Defense Budget Project, says that if the economy at that time is moving ahead as it is now, the loss of defense jobs probably would have &quot;zero&quot; effect on overall employment rates as workers are absorbed elsewhere.    But in specific areas, the impact would be substantial. For instance, McDonnell Douglas Corp., which makes the C-17 and F-15, says cancellation of the C-17 transport plane would imperil 15,000 jobs at its plants, mostly in Southern California, in addition to jobs at subcontractors around the nation. Similar effects might be felt at Lockheed Corp., which is the main contractor for the D-5 missile, and at Martin Marietta Corp. and Boeing Co., which are major contractors for the MX and Midgetman missiles.    But Mr. Borosage says Mr. Jackson's budget plans call for a big program to train defense workers for other jobs.    ---               Jackson's Defense Proposals   -- Freeze Pentagon spending from 1989 through 1993.   -- No more MX missiles.   -- Stop the Midgetman and D-5 missiles.   -- Halt the Stealth bomber.   -- Cut back to 12 aircraft carriers.   -- Reduce U.S. forces in Western Europe.</TEXT></DOC>
