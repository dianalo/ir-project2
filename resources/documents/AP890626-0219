It read: ``Reagan's Concentration Camp.''   ``Does that bother you?'' asked the Rev. Gerard Jean-Juste, theexile leader.   He was assured in the strongest terms that the sign did botherRivkind, a fervent admirer of Ronald Reagan and traditional Americanvalues, albeit he sometimes dresses in black leather and zips aroundtown on his motorcycle.   The next day, the sign had been replaced.   The new one: ``Rivkind's Concentration Camp.''   Rivkind had to laugh when he called Jean-Juste after that one.Jean-Juste was laughing, too. The priest, who has been the outspokenleader of Miami's Haitians for a decade, may not like Rivkind'spolicies, but he likes Rivkind.   ``We are friends and enemies at the same time,'' Jean-Justeexplains. ``We tease each other and laugh together, but when we areon business we are both devils.''   For his part, Rivkind, who recently rebuked Jean-Juste publiclyfor calling him ``Mr. Hitler,'' promises to invite his friend Gerryto his going-away party when he retires later this year after 22years of federal government service.   ``The Perry and Gerry Show,'' the ongoing exchanges between twoof Miami's most public figures, is symptomatic of the U.S.Immigration and Naturalization Service in Miami in the six yearssince Rivkind returned to his hometown from Washington.   Rivkind, the self-styled ``bad-boy bureaucrat'' is in charge ofthe nation's most volatile immigration district. In dealing withHaitians, Cubans, Nicaraguans and others flooding into thisimmigrant city, he keeps his office door ajar and his phone linesopen and runs his district like a benevolent despot, quite unlikethe nation's 34 other immigration districts.   ``I think Perry Rivkind has been a breath of fresh air,'' saysIra Kurzban, a Miami attorney who recently filed the latest in 10years' worth of lawsuits challenging U.S. treatment of Haitianimmigrants.   ``The Miami INS district office has for a long time been ahotbed,'' says Verne Jervis, chief INS spokesman in Washington.``It's such an international city there are an awful lot of forcesat work there. It takes a real juggling act to try to carry out theimmigration law.''   Under Rivkind, Jervis says, the ``INS in Miami probably has moresupport there than ever before. His openness, the access to hisoffice are the highest they've ever been. A number of people here atINS headquarters certainly view him as a little bit of a maverick,but if you can do that and maintain a semblance of control and orderyou can get away with it.''   The 100,000 or more Haitians in the area detest U.S. interdictionof Haitians at sea and what they see as unfair and even racisttreatment.   While they don't necessarily buy Rivkind's explanation that he'ssimply upholding the law and defending the nation's borders, manyHaitians admire his gestures of humanity, such as his 1984 ordersending immigration officers to Haiti to fetch a 9-year-old Haitianboy who was deported while Rivkind was on vacation.   Cubans, who with more than 800,000 in South Florida constitutethe largest Cuban community anywhere except the city of Havana, havefeted Rivkind and admire his anti-communism. The immigrationdirector says that if he were president, he'd have the Marineslanding on Fidel Castro's beaches tomorrow.   Nicaraguans, more than 100,000 strong in South Florida, likeRivkind's aversion to sending them back to what he considers ahostile, sometimes brutal government. And many in Miami's otherHispanic groups like Rivkind's ``caudillo''-style forcefulpersonality and decisiveness.   Rivkind, the 59-year-old son of Russian immigrants loves his job,the latest in a long series of federal positions. A high schooldropout, he became a master's laureate, Korean War veteran andformer Miami Beach hotelier, vice cop, and county police patrolmanbefore becoming a career federal bureaucrat. Most of his 22 federalyears have been in the Justice Department in various roles, but hestill recalls grimly a few months working in the Pentagon, which hefound stifling.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
