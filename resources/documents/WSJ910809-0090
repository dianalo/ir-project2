It is a region whose troubles bear constantly on thepolitics of the world in the late 20th Century but whosepolitical structures languish in the distant past.   The hope and emotion produced yesterday by the release ofBritish hostage John McCarthy and the prospect of freedom forTerry Anderson, Terry Waite and the others is a product ofthe almost unimaginable medieval darkness of their plight.The hostages haven't even been inmates of an organizedprison; they have passed most of their years as captives inbare rooms inside houses in southern Lebanon controlled by&quot;families&quot; harboring personal and political grievancesagainst rival families, Israel or even various Arabgovernments. The governments of Iran and Syria have atvarious times professed degrees of contact with these&quot;shadowy&quot; groups, though there is no question that theysurvive at the pleasure of these Middle Eastern powers. Thevery idea of a &quot;hostage&quot; is from another age.</LP><TEXT>   We wonder how much longer the Arab nations of the MiddleEast can expect to conduct their affairs within sight of the21st Century using political and social systems dating toeither the authoritarian regimes of the 1930s or the MiddleAges. The modern world spends an inordinate amount of itspolitical time and capital attempting to cope with thisarchaic region's crises or problems -- the hostagemelodramas, the terrorist assaults on civilized life, the oilquestion, the Palestinians no Arab nation wants, the greatstruggle with Israel, the intraregional rivalries and latelythe scandal of BCCI.   The largest and most recent Western commitment, of course,was Operation Desert Storm, made necessary because a group oforganized pirates called the Iraqi Baath Party decided tocapture Kuwait and most likely Saudi Arabia if they could getaway with the initial plunder.   We won the war, and magnificently. But the current hostagedrama revives the serious issue of the war's aftermath. Yes,it will be a good thing if the U.S.-brokered peace conferenceeases tensions between Israel and its neighbors. But there islittle chance that these talks will alter the fundamentallynonproductive political structure of the &quot;governments&quot; thatoccupy the region. Is it more accurate, for example, to saythat Israel would be giving up land to &quot;Syria&quot; or merely toHafez Assad and his Baath partners? It would be like New YorkCity giving Queens to John Gotti.   It had been our hope that one of the achievements ofOperation Desert Storm would be not only deserved punishmentfor Saddam Hussein but also the start of a process to movethese nations toward representative government. The emergingglobal system of trade, finance and politics is going to bemore efficient, productive and peaceful as self-determinationdevelops in the nations of Latin America, Africa, the SovietUnion and Eastern Europe. It would be extremely helpful ifthe Middle East, with its great energy and capital resources,could be integrated into this international network ofnations.   After the war, internationally supervised elections ineither Iraq or Kuwait would have created an importantprecedent and given courage to democrats across the region,notably in Saudi Arabia. Democrats do exist. The area'santiquated medievalism, its constant score-settling andretribution, is not something genetically bound up in thepersonality of the Arabs. There is no more dishearteningexperience today than to listen to one of the many youngerArabs who speak with great eloquence about their desire tocreate a democratic political system that is better suited tousing fully the skills and intelligence of the region'sgrowing middle class. Recall how many of the Kurdsinterviewed while fleeing Saddam after the war were doctors,accountants, lawyers.   When the Gulf war ended, Turkey's Turgut Ozal offered hisnation's developing democratic system as a model. No one tookhim up on it, not the Bush administration nor any of theWestern allies. The endgame with Iraq and thewell-intentioned Arab-Israeli peace conference flow out ofthe same balance-of-power premise that has determined Westernpolicy in the region for some 70 years. But balance isdifficult to maintain when your fulcrum is a &quot;government&quot; runby a thug, king, killer, clan leader or permanentaristocracy.   We hope that all the West's hostages will soon be on theway home. Should that day arrive, however, they will leavebehind millions of people who live as hostages to the MiddleEast's insistent authoritarianism. Until the elected leadersof the West decide that the Middle East's people deserve thesame benefits and protections of self-rule enjoyed in therest of the modern world, the region will be a constantcauldron.</TEXT></DOC>
