Three regions of thermal stability of defect-impurity complexesof different nature were distinguished when analyzing evolution of resonancespectra during postradiation annealings: 120-160 K, 160-240 K, 240-300K. Possible mechanisms of defect structure reconstruction using the ideasof two configurations of host interstitial atoms, differing by the energyof migration activation were discussed. 7 refs.; 2 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
