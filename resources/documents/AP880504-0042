Overall trade was also a record, with total exchanges in bothdirections increasing to $13.8 billion from $11.7 billion in 1986.But the United States bought $2.5 billion worth of goods more thanit sold, compared with 1.6 billion the previous year.   The report, made available this week, details only the secondtime since 1965 that the United States has had a deficit in tradewith these countries.   The deficit would have been greater except for the U.S.government subsidies on the sale of wheat, a major export tocommunist nations. The Soviet Union, China, Poland and Bulgaria _along with U.S. agricultural interests _ all benefited from thesesubsidies.   The Soviets agreed to buy 4 million metric tons, or about 144million bushels, for delivery before Sept. 30, their firstpurchases since October 1985. By the end of the year, they hadagreed to buy another 4.8 million tons, or about 174 millionbushels, for the following crop year. U.S. exports of wheat to theSoviets were worth $389 million in 1987.   U.S. subsidies on these sales varied from $19 to $40 a ton. Theywere given to meet competition from other countries, largely inwestern Europe, which also subsidized their exports.   The commission, an independent U.S. government agency, said thatalthough the Soviets had a good overall grain crop last year, wheatoutput declined by nearly 15 percent and much of what they producedwas not quality wheat.   China bought 4 million tons. Sales of U.S. wheat to China wereworth $139 million in 1987.   The growth of U.S. imports from communist governments was almostentirely the result of increased buying from China. Over a third ofthe U.S. puchases from China were clothes and other textiles for atotal value of $2.5 billion, up from $2.1 billion the year before.</TEXT></DOC>
