One of the areas of interest is theprocessing of natural language. This report discusses the role of thecomputer language PROLOG in Natural Language Processing (NLP) both fromtheoretic and pragmatic viewpoints. The reasons for using PROLOG forNLP are numerous. First, linguists can write natural-language grammarsalmost directly as PROLOG programs; this allows fast-prototyping of NLPsystems and facilitates analysis of NLP theories. Second, semantic representationsof natural-language texts that use logic formalisms are readily producedin PROLOG because of PROLOG's logical foundations. Third, PROLOG's built-ininferencing mechanisms are often sufficient for inferences on the logicalforms produced by NLPs. Fourth, the logical, declarative nature of PROLOGmay make it the language of choice for parallel computing systems. Finally,the fact that PROLOG has a de facto standard (Edinburgh) makes the portingof code from one computer system to another virtually trouble free. Perhapsthe strongest tie one could make between NLP and PROLOG was stated byJohn Stuart Mill in his inaugural Address at St. Andrews: The structureof every sentence is a lesson in logic.</TEXT></DOC>
