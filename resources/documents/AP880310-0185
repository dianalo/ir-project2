Carlucci said Thursday.   Carlucci, who was national security adviser before being namedto the defense post last November, made the statement as a HouseIntelligence subcommittee continued hearings on a bill overhaulingthe procedure for White House cooperation with Capitol Hill onintelligence matters.   Administration officials had suggested previously that apresidential veto of such legislation was likely, but Carlucci'sstatement marked the first time a top administration official hadflatly promised a veto.   The House bill and a similar piece of legislation in the Senatewere a response to the Iran-Contra affair, in which U.S. arms weresecretly sold to Iran and some of the profits diverted to theContra rebels in Nicaragua. Final action on the Senate bill islikely next week when the Democratic-controlled chamber returnsfrom a one-week vacation.   In the case of the Iran-Contra affair, Reagan withheldnotification from Congress about the sale of arms to Iran for 10months in 1986. But he has promised to tell Congress about allfuture covert operations.   ``At some point, we have to rely on trust,'' Carlucci told thesubcommittee. He noted that ``if a future president sets out todeceive a Congress, no amount of statutes will stop him.''   Carlucci said that either the Senate or House bill ``surelywill'' be vetoed by Reagan.   Current laws require that Congress be notified of all covertoperations, except under extraordinary circumstances. In thoselatter cases, the law only requires ``timely notice'' but it doesnot define that phrase. The pending bills would spell out thatnotice must be sent to Capitol Hill within 48 hours after a covertaction starts.   Reagan believes the bills are an unconstitutional limit on hisauthority, Carlucci said.   ``I can think of no step by the Congress which would do moreharm to the process of rebuilding an atmosphere of trust and candorbetween the branches than unilaterally to lay claim to prerogativeswhich the president firmly believes are vested in the executive bythe Constitution,'' he said.   Rep. Matt McHugh, D-N.Y., chairman of the Intelligencesubcommittee, supported the bill and noted that ``in the case ofthe arms sales to Iran, the president construed current law aspermitting him to withhold notice for more than 10 months after thecovert sales had been authorized.''   ``If he had done so (as the law generally requires),'' McHughsaid, ``he would surely have heard some strong objections and mighthave spared the country a serious foreign policy setback andhimself a major political embarrassment.''   But Carlucci argued that ``the failures of the Iran affair werehuman and managerial. No statue can prevent these mistakes.''   ``We will not put the mistrust which caused the Iran-Contraaffair behind us until we trust each other again,'' Carlucci said.   Brent Scowcroft, national security adviser to President Ford anda member of the Tower commission that investigated the Iran-Contraaffair, testified that ``the excessively restrictive languageproposed seems a case of throwing out the baby with the bath. It isnot possible to eliminate every opportunity for abuse by theexecutive without at the same time paralyzing the ability to act.''   He said the legislation arises from the belief that Congresswould have opposed the arms sales and derailed them if it had beennotified.   But ``there is no evidence to support this assumption,''Scowcroft said. ``Indeed, as it was, the president was confronted,by his principal advisors, with views strongly in opposition to theIranian arms sales.''</TEXT></DOC>
