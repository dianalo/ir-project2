The AMR Corp. unit said it will use the machines on all its new Sabre installations. American wouldn't disclose how many computers it plans to buy or how much it will spend. The company generally installs about 4,000 terminals a year for the system, which travel agents use to make reservations and issue tickets.    The airline said the new computers, which will be customized for American, will be available in the third quarter. It said it doesn't plan to replace the terminals now installed in 12,000 travel agencies, but will sell or lease the new computers to agencies that want them.    A spokesman for the airline said it studied a number of computer systems before choosing IBM for its technology and price. The company currently doesn't use personal computers for the system. IBM introduced four new personal computer models last week. </TEXT></DOC>
