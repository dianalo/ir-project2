A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for theDistrict of Columbia Circuit ruled that the FAA improperlyadopted rules to establish the safety enforcement programthat was authorized by Congress as an experiment in 1987.</LP><TEXT>   Gregory Walden, chief counsel of the FAA, called thedecision &quot;a setback&quot; to agency enforcement efforts. &quot;Iconsider it significant,&quot; he said.   Mr. Walden said that since the FAA adopted rules for theenforcement program in September 1988, penalties have beenimposed in 1,800 cases, while another 3,800 cases have beeninitiated. He said the ruling &quot;may wreak havoc on the system&quot;if airlines or their employees try to reopen cases in whichpenalties already have been imposed.   The 1987 law increased to $10,000 from $1,000 the maximumcivil fine for each airline safety violation; as anexperiment, Congress said that for violations cumulativelytotaling less than $50,000, the FAA could impose thepenalties directly, without following the usual course ofreferring the agency's complaints to U.S. attorneys' officesto file suit in court. For fines of more than $50,000, theFAA must still refer the cases to a U.S. attorney.   But in a lawsuit filed by the major airlines' trade group,the Air Transport Association of America, the appeals courtsaid the FAA improperly adopted rules to implement theexperiment. The appeals court said the agency failed to givepublic notice of the proposed rules or to allow a period ofpublic comment.   The Air Transport Association also argued that theprocedures adopted by the FAA are unfair, but the appealscourt didn't take a position on that issue. The decision,written by Judge Harry Edwards, also didn't state whethercompleted cases may be reopened to object to adoption of therules, meaning that issue will have to be tested in otherlawsuits.   Judge Laurence Silberman dissented, saying the FAA rulesare &quot;procedural&quot; in nature and, therefore, may be adopted byan agency without public notice and comment.   The FAA's Mr. Walden said that of the 5,600 casesinitiated to date, 3,640 involved security violations by theairlines or their employees. Many of these are cases in whichthe FAA sends test objects, such as mock guns, throughairline security checkpoints to see whether detection devicesspot them.   Other types of cases that the FAA has handled through theenforcement program involve safety-related maintenance andoperational violations. The program generally doesn't applyto cases in which safety violations may have caused orcontributed to causes of plane crashes; these cases arehandled by the National Transportation Safety Board andprobably involve fines of more than $50,000.   Mr. Walden was unsure whether the FAA will now issue newrules or whether it will appeal, either to the full 10-memberappeals court or to the Supreme Court.   Meanwhile, Michael Sundermeyer, a Washington lawyer whorepresented the Air Transport Association, said theexperimental enforcement program is due to expire on April30, unless Congress extends it. The court ruling, he said,may help dissuade Congress from extending the program. &quot;Theconsensus in the aviation community is that it has beenunfairly implemented,&quot; he said.</TEXT></DOC>
