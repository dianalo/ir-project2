STEICHEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   East Germany's new communist leader will travel toMoscow within the next two days for talks with Kremlin officials onpolitical reform, Communist Party sources said Monday.   Activists in Leipzig, where 300,000 people marched one week agoin the largest such demonstration in East Germany's 40-yearhistory, said protesters would take to the streets again today toup keep pressure for democratic reform.   Demands for reform have reached a fevered pitch this month andthe government sponsored town meetings across the nation Sunday todiscuss change.   At least 20,000 people attended the rally in East Berlin andmany jeered local officials and demanded explanations for misdeedsand blunders.   Party sources said Communist leader Egon Krenz would meet withSoviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in Moscow to discuss thecourse of reform talks now under way in East Germany.   West Germany's ARD television network said Krenz would go toMoscow on Tuesday.   Meanwhile, a leader of East Germany's Liberal Democratic Partycharged that the nation's ``political structure no longercorresponded to the will of the people.''   Manfred Bogisch suggested in a commentary in his party'snewspaper, Der Morgen, that the Communist Party's leading rolewould have to be won, not dictated.   Although Bogisch reiterated that socialism was not at issue inthe reform debate, he said the communist leadership's policies are`now a matter of debate.''   ``Those who were responsible for the stagnation will have totake responsibility for it,'' he said.   The Liberal Democrats have been at the forefront of efforts tocreate more political pluralism within East Germany's socialistsystem.   Under East Germany's constitution, all political parties arealigned with the Communist Party. The Liberal Democrats have saidthe parties should have more independence.   East Germans have taken to the streets by the hundreds ofthousands this month to demand a more open society with freeelections, a free press and an end to one-party rule. Sincemid-September, more than 50,000 have fled to the West, many of themyoung skilled workers.   The Communist Party newspaper Neues Deutschland today describedweekend's rallies and protests as ``passionate and open, pugnaciousand constructive'' and made no effort to discourage futuredemonstrations that have been drawing thousands to the streets eachnight.   But it also declared that recent events stem from advances insocialism.   Krenz has promised ``a new course'' for the country, includingfreer travel to the West and an amnesty for people jailed fortrying to escape what has been a tightly-controlled society.   Sunday's meeting in Berlin quickly turned into an emotionalforum, with speakers criticizing privileges accorded Communistofficials. They also accused police of brutality against peacefulpro-democracy protesters earlier this month.   Guenter Schabowski, East Berlin party chief and a member of thecountry's ruling Politburo, drew applause when he announced hissupport for ``approved and well-ordered'' demonstrations in thecity.   Since Krenz took power Oct. 18 officials have launched anunparalleled campaign of dialogue and openness aimed at winningpublic trust. Many activists are skeptical, however, sayingCommunist leaders are only interested in reforms that do notchallenge their monopoly on power.   Communist officials in recent days have appealed to protestersto attend government-organized dialogue sessions rather than taketo the streets.   A member of the country's largest opposition group, New Forum,was quoted in an interview with a West German newspaper Sunday assaying street protests will continue as long as the governmentrefuses to recognize opposition groups.</TEXT></DOC>
