Both men ran North Carolina companies that soldfactory-built homes. Both firms for years were highlysuccessful.   But in 1987, the similarities between Mr. St. George andMr. Sauls began to disappear. That year, profits at bothcompanies took an unprecedented plunge, following loandefaults by home buyers. Convinced that financing for hiscustomers would begin to evaporate, Mr. St. George built up aunit to supply the money himself. Mr. Sauls kept relying onoutside lenders.</LP><TEXT>   Today Mr. St. George is enjoying the reward for knowingwhen to alter a company's direction. But Mr. Sauls is payingthe penalty for mistakenly staying the course.   With in-house financing covering two-thirds of the homesthe company sells, profit at Mr. St. George's Oakwood HomesCorp. is again climbing robustly. In the company's fiscalyear ended Sept. 30, earnings jumped 93% from the previousyear, to $5.5 million, on a 29% increase in revenue, to$137.2 million. &quot;We have financing in the market when otherpeople don't,&quot; Mr. St. George says.   Mr. Sauls' Manufactured Homes Inc., meanwhile, is mired inlosses, its sources of buyer financing practically vanished.In March, the company's own creditor ousted Mr. Sauls aschairman and chief executive. It also forced theentrepreneur, who owns 50% of his company's shares, to giveup the voting rights to his stock.   &quot;Financing is everything in this business,&quot; says JamesJohnson III, who ran Mr. Sauls's manufacturing plant until itshut down last year. &quot;Manufactured Homes' dried up.&quot;   Mr. Sauls declined to comment.   Until 1987, Oakwood and Manufactured Homes were two oftheir industry's highest fliers. Mr. St. George had doubledOakwood's revenue and profit since becoming president andchief executive in 1979. Manufactured Homes had grown evenfaster, its revenue since 1981 increasing 17-fold, to $119.7million.   Part of the companies' success came from soaring Southerndemand for inexpensive housing: Some factory-built homes sellfor only $10,000. But even at those prices, only 15% offactory-built home owners pay cash. Thus the real key to thegrowth at Oakwood and Manufactured Homes was buyer financing.   Typically, Oakwood and Manufactured Homes lent 90% to 95%of the purchase price to home buyers, then resold the debt tolarge financial institutions. Factory-built home loanstypically pay a higher interest rate than regular real estatemortgages.   Reselling the loans itself became a potentially largesource of revenue: If Oakwood or Manufactured Homesguaranteed repayment of the debt, the financial institutions,in effect, would share the interest payments with them.   But the risk of so-called recourse financing became clearwhen a growing number of home buyers began defaulting ontheir loans, leaving the companies on the hook to repay thedebt themselves. In a single quarter in 1987, Mr. Saulsincreased Manufactured Homes' loan-loss reserves by $6million, forcing the firm to report a 61% drop in annualearnings.   Despite Manufactured Homes' plunging profit, Mr. Saulstold shareholders in 1987 that the company's strategy &quot;hasmet the test.&quot; The problems that led to the company'sunexpected setback are temporary, he added, noting that&quot;forecasters are now of the opinion that demand for low-costhousing is on the increase&quot; after three years of decliningindustry sales.   But at Oakwood's Greensboro headquarters, 30 miles fromManufactured Homes' offices in Winston-Salem, the mood wasdifferent. Even before the company reported its 94% declinein 1987 earnings, Mr. St. George had decided that the firmcouldn't remain &quot;the same old Oakwood with a few Band-Aids.&quot;   First, Mr. St. George shut down all 12 of his salescenters in Texas -- the source of most of his troubledrecourse loans. Then he set out to build up Oakwood's ownfinance unit so that it would hold on to the loans itoriginated instead of selling them. Doing so would allow thecompany to pocket all of the interest the loans earned. Italso would put Oakwood in charge of collections, a crucialjob it normally had to turn over to the buyers of its loans.   To attract an institutional investor that would fund hisfinance unit, Mr. St. George began overhauling operations. Heshook up management, replacing 19 of 30 midlevel andupper-level executives. He raised productivity, increasingthe number of homes manufactured at the company's threeplants to 22 a day from 17. He slashed costs, reducingOakwood's break-even point to 225 home sales a month from300, and expanded into more luxurious multisection homes thatwere accounting for a growing share of demand.   Mr. St. George's long view paid off last year, when a unitof Prudential Insurance Co. committed in two transactions tolend Oakwood's finance subsidiary a total of $170 million.The insurer also happened to be Manufactured Homes' largestcreditor. But while Prudential's faith in Mr. St. George wasgrowing, the lender's confidence in Mr. Sauls was fadingfast.   In contrast to Oakwood's quick turnaround, ManufacturedHomes' condition had deteriorated steadily. Contrary to Mr.Sauls's optimistic suggestion in 1987 that demand forfactory-built homes would improve, industry shipmentscontinued to slide, reaching a 27-year low in 1990. Withsales declining and loan defaults on the rise, buyers for Mr.Sauls's loans began to disappear -- taking with them theincome the company received from guaranteeing the debt itsold.   In 1989, more than a year after his troubles firstsurfaced, Mr. Sauls took drastic action, slashing employment,closing sales centers, shutting down and later renting outthe manufacturing plant and pulling out of two states,Florida and Alabama. But Manufactured Homes' losses for theyear quintupled from the 1988 level to a staggering $45.1million. By then, says John Robinson, the former president ofthe company's Florida office, &quot;maybe it was too little toolate for anything you tried.&quot;   Prudential and Mr. Sauls groped for ways to save thecompany. The insurer lent Manufactured Homes more money,waived violations of loan covenants and gave the company moretime to find alternate financing or a buyer for its debt.According to Manufactured Homes' Securities and ExchangeCommission filings, Prudential repeatedly set deadlines onlyto have Mr. Sauls repeatedly miss them.   Finally, in March, Prudential agreed to swap $46 millionin debt for equity in the company -- but only if Mr. Saulsstepped down and gave up the voting rights to his sharesunder terms that weren't disclosed.   In a report to shareholders in early 1990, as negotiationswith Prudential progressed, Mr. Sauls sounded as optimisticas ever. He said he believed &quot;past difficulties of theindustry are coming to an end&quot; and that he looked forward torestoring his company's health. &quot;Our task has just begun,&quot; hesaid at the time, unaware that the job -- if it succeeds --would be completed without him.</TEXT></DOC>
