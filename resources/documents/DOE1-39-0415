This paper develops the concept of hit probabilities as a moreaccurate measure of the probability of a cell nucleus sustaining damagefollowing irradiation by alpha particles. The hit probability for a rangeof alpha energies, target sizes and irradiation geometries is presented.The general mathematical relations applicable to the calculation of hitprobabilities for alphas under selected geometries of radiobiologicalinterest are presented. Finally, the ratio of hit probability or meannumber of hits to absorbed dose under selected conditions of irradiationis presented and used to demonstrate the extent to which a calculationof absorbed dose may result in errors in risk extrapolation.</TEXT></DOC>
