A new outlook report by the department's Economic ResearchService said world output of grain, oilseeds and meat is rising in1990-91.   ``Consumption, however, is forecast to grow more oderately, andending stocks of some commodities are expected to rise,'' thereport said.   In the United States, the average prices in the 1990-91marketing years for various crops will show a variety of reactions.   The average prices of wheat, milk, barley, oats and rice areexpected to be lower than a year earlier, while the prices of corn,soybeans and most meats will hold about steady or rise slightly,the report said.   Meanwhile, the mix of crops farmers plant in 1991 will probablychange more than in recent years, it said.   ``Farmers will be reacting to the planting flexibilityprovisions of the new farm (law) and will be more responsive tochanging market prices,'' the report said. ``If yields revert totrend and planted acreage remains steady, foreign grain outputcould decline as well, perhaps lending some support to prices.''</TEXT></DOC>
