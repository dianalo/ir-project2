But depositors asked in a spot check of Dallas savings and loanson Friday indicated they would wait and see if the fee actually wasadopted before taking any action.   Judy Rollerson, a teller at Metropolitan Savings, said severalcustomers mentioned the proposal but none indicated they would closetheir accounts.   ``They don't think it will really happen,'' she said. ``They'rejust talking about how preposterous it really is.''   Savings and loan officials have been watching customer reactionsince the Bush administration indicated that one option forfinancing a federal bailout of troubled thrifts would be to chargeSandamp;L, bank and credit union customers 25 cents per every $100 theyhad deposited.   The measure would require Congressional approval.   M. Danny Wall, chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, saidThursday that the proposal was making savings and loan depositorsnervous and had led some to withdraw their money.   Since Wednesday, Wall said, ``There have been cases where theysay, `I don't like what I heard on TV, I'm taking my money out.' ''   Depositor reaction to the proposal had not placed any savings andloans in jeopardy, he said.   Financial industry officials in Dallas, as well as theircustomers, indicated there have been few account closings as aresult of the deposit tax trial balloon.   ``We've had a few questions to it,'' said Ruth Lack, director ofcorporate communications for First Gibraltar, FSB in Houston. ``Wehave not had any action on it. Most of our depositors realize thatthis is nothing more than a trial at this point.''   George Barclay, president of the Federal Home Loan Bank ofDallas, stated there has been ``no measurable increase in depositwithdrawals'' due to publicity about the proposed fee, and creditedconsumer confidence that the government would uphold the safety oftheir deposits.   An official with Southwest Savings Association who refused toidentify herself said she has sensed ``quite a bit of concern''among customers.   ``People don't want to have to pay to save their money,'' shesaid. ``If I had a savings account and had to pay, I'd close it, I'msorry.''   Some customers said they probably would withdraw their money ifthe deposit fee was implemented.   ``I have a lot of money in savings and loans, and I hate thatproposal,'' said one customer at the Southwest Savings downtownbranch.   ``Right now, I'm reading George Bush's lips. I hope they drop it.If they don't, it's going to hurt savings and loans _ a lot,'' saidthe customer, who declined to give his name.   Nevertheless, the customer said he would wait and see if the feewas imposed before moving his money.   Several customers said they had not heard about the fee.   Only one of eight Dallas savings and loans branches contactedFriday reported a withdrawal, although the majority declined tocomment.   One Dallas man promptly withdrew his money from Sunbelt Savingsafter hearing of the fee proposal, said account representative TimPalla.   ``He came in with a smile on his face and said, `I can't handlethis any more. It isn't you people, it's the government,'' Pallasaid.   Palla said that was the only withdrawal he knew of. Othercustomers have called with questions about the proposed fee, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
