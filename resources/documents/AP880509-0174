(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A retired state Supreme Court justiceviolated rules of judicial misconduct for abusing his power to helpa female friend who was then an assistant judge, a board said in areport issued Monday.   The state Judicial Conduct Board found Justice William Hill inviolation of codes governing conduct on five of 11 counts aftermembers disagreed on the nature of Hill's relationship with JaneWheel.   Michael Marks, one of Hill's lawyers, said Monday that he wouldask the state Supreme Court, which is the final judge of Hill'sconduct, to overturn the findings by the seven-member conduct board.   The board said in a report to the Supreme Court that ``seriousviolations of the Code of Judicial Conduct were committed byJustice Hill'' and found ``the entire judicial system is stillsuffering from the fallout of his misconduct.''   The board made no specific recommendation of discipline, leavingit up to the Supreme Court to determine whether Hill should bereprimanded or forbidden from coming out of retirement to hearcases.   Hill, who turns 71 on Tuesday, retired from the Supreme Courtlast year, a few months after the misconduct charges were filed inJanuary 1987 against him and two other justices.   The charges against Justice Ernest Gibson III were dropped andJustice Thomas Hayes died.   Meanwhile, the scandal worsened a backlog in the state's highestcourt, as the justices refused Gov. Madeleine Kunin's request thatthey step aside, and instead disqualified themselves from hundredsof cases involving people connected with their case.   All three justices were originally accused of improperly usingtheir clout on the court to advance the interests of Wheel, who wasthen an assistant judge in Chittenden County.   A court employee testified that Wheel had been seen with herarms around Hill, but Hill and Wheel testified they were not closeand did not have an affair. Hill described the relationship ascollegial.   The Judicial Conduct Board ruled that Hill presided over casesinvolving Wheel when he should not have and that he improperlyhelped her.   The board found Hill innocent of many of the misconduct chargesdealing directly with the Wheel relationship, but two members fileda dissent arguing that a significant relationship did exist.   Marks said his interpretation was that the board felt there wasan appearance of wrongdoing but no real wrongdoing.   Wheel, who lost her re-election bid in 1986, has been convictedin a separate criminal case stemming from allegations that shebilled the state for days she did not work. She has yet to besentenced.</TEXT></DOC>
