(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A man who has pleaded guilty to wild animalpoaching charges kept a ledger that shows he netted about $600,000from the illegal slaughter of hundreds of animals, including baldeagles, officials said.   The ledger taken from the home of Ralph J. Jackson in Sequimindicates he poached at least 25 bald eagles and hundreds of otherwild animals, Ron Perregrin of the state Department of Wildlife saidat a news conference Friday.   Jackson, 38, was charged with poaching 13 elk in late Septemberafter an anonymous caller told officials Jackson had an illegallyobtained polar bear skin, Perregrin said.   Investigators never found the polar bear skin, but theydiscovered illegally obtained elk and deer, and the ledger,Perregrin said.   Sales listed in the ledger over 3{ years include 25 eagles soldfor $512,650, 135 elk for $28,500, 286 deer for $24,270, 18 nativecats for $15,150, 12 seals for $14,500 and nine hawks for $2,775.   The ledger also listed purchasers and the investigationcontinues, Perregrin said.   Federal authorities arrested Jackson in October after hethreatened the lives of a witness in the eagle transactions andseveral investigating officers and their families, Perregrin said.   The department has talked to many local people who knew Jacksonwas a poacher, Perregrin said. But no one knew the extent of hisactivities and just assumed he took a deer or two for dinner for thefamily.   Records indicate Jackson was receiving public assistance.   Jackson pleaded guilty in Clallam and Jefferson counties topoaching charges and was sentenced to up to 24 years in prison,Perregrin said. He also pleaded guilty to 10 federal felony countsof selling bald eagles and one count of threatening a federalwitness.   He is in custody awaiting sentencing Feb. 23 on the federalcounts, and could face additional prison time and millions ofdollars in fines.   His wife Elaine also pleaded guilty in connection with thepoaching, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
