Dellas,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Staff Director, Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">I. Background Information</ITAG>The Department of Defense (DoD) has developed programs designed to expandits industrial base and increase competition for its requirements for goodsand services, thereby reducing the cost of maintaining a strong nationalsecurity. Its efforts to increase competition among the private sectorhave been supplemented by many state and local governments and other entitieswhere their interest in improving the business climate and economic developmentin their communities is compatible with these DoD objectives. To assistin furthering this mutual interest, a Cooperative Agreement Program hasbeen established by which the DoD can share the cost of supporting existingprocurement technical assistance programs (PTA) being conducted by stateand local governments and private non-profit entities and can encouragethe establishment of similar programs in their communities.The Fiscal Year (FY) 1985 DoD Authorization Act, Pub. L. 98-525, amendedTitle 10, United States Code, by adding a Chapter 142 which authorizesthe Secretary of Defense, acting through the Director, Defense LogisticsAgency (DLA), to enter into cost sharing cooperative agreements with stateand local governments, and other non-profit entities (hereinafter referredto as eligible entities as defined in Section 3 of this procedure) to establishand conduct PTA programs during FY 85. The program continues under Title10, United States Code, as amended.The Congress has authorized a total of $7 million to support the programduring FY 89. Of this total, $500,000 is available for an Indian programonly and such program will be executed centrally by Headquarters (HQ) DLA.Accordingly, each of the nine Defense Contract Administration ServicesRegions (DCASRs) within DLA will be authorized to award approximately $700,000of the remaining $6.5 million authorized for FY 89 as its share of programcosts to applicants within the geographical area under its cognizance.In cases where the area being or to be serviced by the eligible entityencompasses more than one DCASR's area of geographic cognizance, eligibleentities are to submit their proposals to the one DCASR having cognizanceover the preponderant part of the area being or to be serviced. Only oneproposal will be accepted from a single eligible entity. The addressesand geographic areas under the cognizance of each of the DCASRs, togetherwith the name of the Associate Director of Small Business who is designatedthe Procurement Technical Assistance Cooperative Agreement Program Manager,is at Encl 1.Additional Limitations placed on these funds follow:(a) DoD cost sharing shall not exceed 50% of the net cost of a single program,excluding any Federal funds and other income, except that the DoD sharemay be increased up to 75% for an existing program or new start that qualifiessolely as a distressed area. In no event, shall the DoD share of the netprogram cost exceed $300,000 for programs providing state-wide coverageand $150,000 for all other programs.(b) Eligible entities are not to subcontract more than 10% of their totalprogram costs for private consulting services to support the program.(c) These limitations may be modified by the HQs DLA Policy Council asnecessary to comply with legislative or other requirements.The DoD presently provides procurement and technical assistance to businessfirms through its network of Small Business Specialists located in industrialcenters around the country. the DCASR Associate Directors of Small Business,located in these industrial centers, will be available to provide eligibleentities such assistance as necessary to explain and interpret the solicitationrequirements when issued, to provide general guidance in preparing proposals,and to provide training and other technical assistance to recipients ofcooperative agreements.Procurement technical assistance given to clients for marketing their goodsand services to other Federal Agencies and/or state and local governmentswill not be considered when evaluating proposals. However, eligible entitiesare encouraged to consider supplementing their DoD program to include thosemarketing opportunities for business firms located in the area being orto be serviced.The purpose of this proposed revised procedure is to make available toall eligible entities the prerequisite requirements, policies and procedureswhich will govern the award of cooperative agreements by the DLA. Also,this procedure establishes the guidelines which will govern the administrationof cooperative agreements.Although this procedure will affect all eligible entities desiring to enterinto a cooperative agreement with the DLA, the DLA has determined thatthis rule does not involve a substantial issue of fact or law, and thatit is unlikely to have a substantial or major impact on the Nation's economyor large numbers of individuals or businesses. This determination is basedon the fact that this proposed Cooperative Agreement Procedure implementspolicies already published by the Office of Management and Budget pursuantto Chapter 63, Title 31, United States Code, Using Procurement Contractsand Grant and Cooperative Agreements. In addition, DLA Cooperative Agreementswill be entered into pursuant to the authorities and restrictions containedin the annual DoD Authorization and Appropriation Acts.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Other Information</ITAG>The language contained in the current Cooperative Agreement Procedure limitedthe period of coverage to the FY 88 Program in that it addressed the FY88 Authorization Act requirements in specific terms, including the exactdollar amounts of funding applicable to the Program. This proposed revisionto the procedure will provide general guidance for cooperative agreementsentered into by the DLA and will become a permanent document for the durationof the FY 89 programs.The DLA has determined that the proposed procedure does not involve substantialissues of fact or law and the procedure is unlikely to have a substantialor major impact on the Nation's economy or large numbers of individualsor businesses. Therefore, public hearings were not conducted.Since this is the DLA's permanent procedure covering cooperative agreementspursuant to 31 U.S.C. 6301 <T3>et seq,</T3> using Procurement Contracts and Grant and CooperativeAgreements, additional comments are invited on the procedures and are tobe submitted to the Defense Logistics Agency, ATTN: DLA-UM, Cameron Station,Alexandria, VA 22304-6100. All comments received by 13 February 1989 willbe evaluated to determine if any revisions should be made to Subpart III.<ITAG tagnum="84">COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT REGULATION GENERAL PROGRAM</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">III. Proposed Revision to DLA Procedure_Cooperative Agreements</ITAG>1. Scope(a) This procedure implements Chapter 142 of Title 10, United States Code,as amended, and establishes requirements for the award and administrationof Cost Sharing Cooperative Agreements entered into between the DefenseLogistics Agency (DLA) and eligible entities. Under these agreements Departmentof Defense (DoD) financial assistance provided to recipients will coverthe DoD share of the cost of establishing new and/or maintaining existingProcurement Technical Assistance (PTA) Programs for furnishing PTA to businessentities.(b) A cooperative agreement is a binding legal instrument which reflectsa relationship between the DLA and a cooperative agreement recipient forthe purpose of transferring money, property, services or anything of valueto the recipient for the accomplishment of the requirements described therein.The requirement shall be authorized by Federal statute and substantialinvolvement shall be anticipated between the DLA and the recipient duringperformance of the agreement.2. Policy(a) When proposals for cooperative agreements are obtained through theissuance of a DLA Solicitation for Cooperative Agreement Proposals, hereinafterreferred to as a SCAP, the contents of this procedure shall be incorporated,in part or in whole, into the program solicitation for the purpose of establishingadministrative requirements for the execution and administration of DLACooperative Agreements. Program solicitations may include additional administrativerequirements when such requirements are required by program legislationor are not included in this procedure.(b) It is the DLA policy to encourage and maximize open and fair competitionwhen awarding cooperative agreements for establishing or maintaining existingPTA programs. Cooperative agreements will be awarded on a competitive basisas a result of the issuance of a SCAP. However, the DoD, through the DLA,reserves the right to make or deny an award to an applicant whose applicationis competitive pursuant to the other factors detailed in paragraph 5(e)below if competition for DoD goods and services would be enhanced. Forexample, an award may be denied to reduce or eliminate overlapping or duplicatecoverage in selected geographic areas or where the best interest of thegovernment will not be served.(c) SCAPs inviting the submission of proposals shall be given the widestpractical dissemination to all known eligible entities and to those thatrequest copies subsequent to its issuance. All eligible entities that haveadvised the DCASR of their interest in submitting a proposal, under theSCAP, will be invited to participate in a presolicitation conference tobe held at a location to be designated by the DCASR approximately 30 calendardays prior to the SCAP closing date.(d) Any solicitation issued in accordance with this procedure shall notbe considered to be an offer made by the DoD and will not obligate theDLA to make any awards under this program. The DoD is also not responsiblefor any monies expended or expense incurred by applicants prior to theaward of a cost sharing cooperative agreement.(e) The DoD share of an eligible entity's proposal and award recipient'snet program cost (NPC) shall not exceed 50%, except in the case of a distressedarea (as defined in paragraph 3(g) below) the DoD share may be increasedto an amount not to exceed 75%. However, in no event is the DoD share ofany single net program cost to exceed $300,000 for programs providing state-widecoverage (defined in paragraph 3(x) below) and $150,000 for all other programs.(f) During each fiscal year (FY) for which funding is authorized for thePTA program at least one cooperative agreement for either an existing programor a new start shall be awarded within the geographic cognizance of eachof DLA's nine Defense Contract Administration Services Regions (DCASRs).In cases where the area being or to be serviced by an eligible entity encompassesmore than one DCASR's area of geographic cognizance, the eligible entityshould submit its application to the one DCASR having cognizance over themajority of the area being or to be serviced. Only one application willbe accepted from a single eligible entity.(g) The award of a cooperative agreement shall not in any way obligatethe DoD to enter into a contract or give preference for the award of acontract to a concern or firm which becomes a client of the award recipient.(h) The award of a cooperative agreement under this program shall covera twelve month performance period.(i) To assist the DoD in achieving its socio-economic goals, applicantsand cooperative agreement recipients are to give special emphasis to assistingsmall disadvantaged business firms participating in DoD contracting opportunities.A concerted effort will be made by each cooperative agreement recipientto identify small disadvantaged business firms and provide them with marketingand technical assistance, particularly where such firms are referred toa recipient for assistance by a DoD component.(j) The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) contains numerous clausesand provisions which provide operational guidance and spell out the rightsand obligations of parties in Federal Procurement transactions. Althoughthe regulation is not applicable per se to cooperative agreements, someof the provisions contained in the Regulation may be suitable for inclusionin cooperative agreement solicitation and award documents. Therefore, theclauses and provisions contained therein may be made a part of all cooperativeagreement solicitations and award documents if not otherwise covered underthe Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circulars A-102 (Grants and CooperativeAgreements with State and Local Governments) and A-110 (Grants and Agreementswith Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals and other Non-profit Organizations).Where appropriate, the language of the clause(s) may be changed and willbe modified to change ``contract'' to ``cooperative agreement'' and ``contractor''to ``participant'' as necessary. Clauses and provisions specified as mandatorywill not be subject to negotiations. Such clauses and provisions will onlybe used if the applicable FAR dollar threshold(s) are met. For example,if there is a prerequisite $100,000 threshold for applying the clause,that particular clause will only be used in the cooperative agreement solicitationor award document if the total program cost of the project (including boththe applicant's and DoD's share of total program costs) equals or exceedsthe $100,000 threshold.(k) The addition of any clauses and provisions not identified in the solicitationor the modification of clauses and provisions included in the solicitationwhich are not designated as being mandatory may be negotiated.(l) Award recipients are not required to obtain or retain private consultingservices for any extended period of time. Accordingly, any costs beingproposed for such services are not to exceed 10% of the total program cost.Costs in excess of 10% included in the eligible entity's proposal willcause the proposal to be rejected.(m) Reasonable quantities of government publications, such as ``Sellingto the Military'' may be furnished to award recipients at no cost, subjectto availability.(n) For the purpose of executing cooperative agreements, the HQs DLA CooperativeAgreement Program Manager and DCASR Associate Director of Small Businessare delegated the authority to execute cooperative agreements and shallnot require appointment as a contracting officer. (o) Each cooperative agreement recipient's area of performance will belimited to the geographical area specified in its proposal. (p) To the extent that the annual DoD Authorization and Appropriation Actsprovide for restricting some part of the total funds authorized to accommmodatespecial socio-economic requirements, any specific requirements relatedto the restricted funds which differ from the requirements of this regulationwill be identified in the solicitation for cooperative agreement proposals.3.

Procedures for Processing SCAPs and Award of Cooperative Agreements</ITAG>(a) The cooperative agreement program manager will develop and preparethe SCAP(s). Also, he/she will be responsible for assuring that adequatefunds are made available to the DCASR and for considering other factorsin the selection process necessary to fully protect the interests of thegovernment.(b) The SCAP(s) will be approved by the HQ DLA Cooperative Agreement PolicyCouncil and will be issued by HQ DLA or through each DCASR. The PolicyCouncil will be comprised of representatives from the HQ DLA Offices ofGeneral Counsel, Contracting, Comptroller, Congressional Affairs and SmallBusiness. The Staff Director, Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilizationshall serve as the Policy Council Chairman and final appeal authority fordisagreements between the Cooperative Agreement Program Manager, DCASRAssociate Director of Small Business and the eligible entity and/or CooperativeAgreeement recipient. The Council will be responsible for reviewing theevaluations and recommendations of the Cooperative Agreement Program Managerand the evaluation panel.(c) For special program, the HQs DLA Cooperative Agreeemnt Policy Councilwill be the review and approval authority for award selections.(d) The evaluation of proposals submitted in response to the SCAP and theselection of award recipients will be conducted as detailed below:(1) Proposals will be evaluated by a specially constituted evaluation panelestablished at HQ DLA. The panel will be comprised of representatives fromthe DCASR offices of small business, contract management, comptroller,and other offices deemed appropriate by the HQ DLA Cooperative AgreementProgram Policy Council. However, the DCASR Associate Director of SmallBusiness, who is delegated the authority to execute the cooperative agreements,shall not serve as panel member. A member of the Office of Counsel, HQDLA, will be appointed to the panel, but will serve in an advisory capacityonly.(2) Prior to making a comprehensive evaluation of a proposal, the DCASRAssociate Director of Small Business will make an initial evaluation todetermine if each proposal contains sufficient technical, cost and otherinformation, has been signed by a responsible official authorized to bindthe eligible entity and generally meets all requirements of the SCAP. Ifthe proposal does not meet those requirements, it will be rejected anda comprehensive evaluation will not be made. In such case, a prompt replywill be sent to the proposer by the DCASR Associate Director of Small Businessindicating the reason for its proposal not being accepted. Otherwise acceptableproposals with the DCASR Associate Director of Small Business recommendationswill be forwarded to the Cooperative Agreement Program Manager at HQs DLA.Under existing programs only, in the event the applicant's ProcurementTechnical Assistance Performance Report (RCS Number DLA (Q) 2545) is missing,the missing report will be attached to the proposal by the cognizant DCASRAssociate Director of Small Business.(3) Revised proposals will not be accepted from applicants whose proposalsare rejected after the initial evaluation unless the revised proposalsis postmarked or is hand delivered prior to the closing date of the SCAP.Any proposal received which is unsigned or otherwise rejected will notbe given additional review consideration and will be retained with otherunsuccessful applications by the DCASR Associate Director of Small Business.(4) For an otherwise acceptable proposal the DCASR Associate Director ofSmall Business will include a review to verify the accuracy of the classificationof the proposal concerning the entity's stated program status as existingor a new start. In the event the DCASR Associate Director of Small Businessconsiders the proposal status misclassified, he/she will review the matterwith the applicant. If there is disagreement, the Associate Director ofSmall Business' determination of the application's classification willbe final and not subject to further review.(5) Proposals which pass the initial evaluation will be subjected to acomprehensive evaluation by the HQs DLA evaluation panel. The basic purposeof the comprehensive evaluation is to assess the relative merits of theproposals to determine which offer the greatest likelihood of achievingthe stated program objectives, considering technical, quality, personnelqualifications, estimated cost, and other relevant factors. Each proposalwill be evaluated by the panel in accordance with stated criteria and rankedin order of excellence to determine which will best further specific programgoals. All findings and recipient selections will be documented, signedby the panel members, and retained to provide an adequate record to supportthe panel's decisions. Upon completion of its review, the evaluation panelwill submit the panel results and its recommendations to the CooperativeAgreement Program Manager.(6) The Cooperative Agreement Program Manager will determine whether sufficientfunds have been allocated to the DSASR to cover the DoD share of costsand will review the panel recommendations and results for completeness.Upon completion of the fund analysis and review of the panel results, theCooperative Agreement Program Manager will forward the panel results withrecommendations and comments (if any) to the HQ DLA Policy Council forreview.(e) The HQ DLA Policy Council will review the Cooperative Agreement ProgramManager and evaluation panel's recommendations. The results of its reviewand its recommendations will be submitted to the appropriate DCASR Commanderfor approval. In developing its recommendations the Council may consideradditional factors necessary to fully protect the interest of the Government.These factors may include, but are not limited to, economic downturns thateffect national security in selected geographic areas; terminations ofmajor DoD contracts; availability of funds; the potential for increasingcompetition for selected goods and services required by the DoD; the existenceof other procurement technical assistance programs in the area; and compliancewith any legislative requirement imposed on program funds.(f) After approval of the award selections by the DCASR Commander and congressionalnotification provided, the cooperative agreements(s) will be executed bythe DCASR Associate Director of Small Business.6. Evaluation Criteria(a) The evaluation factors for new starts and existing programs, with theirrelative importance, will be specified in the SCAP.(b) The following evaluation factors (which may be subject to change) willbe considered as the evaluation criteria for new starts:(1) The types of qualifications of personnel assigned or to be assignedto the program.(2) The quality of the PTA Program in existence or being planned for:a. Developing new clients.b. Assisting existing clients.c. Any program established or to be established to identify and provideextraordinary assistance to small disadvantaged business firms.(3) The number of clients in the geographic areas being or to be serviced.This includes carrying out the DoD policy described in paragraph 2(i) abovefor which the socio-economic status of clients should be estimated.(4) The amount and percentage of net program costs to be shared by DoD.(5) The level of unemployment in the area being or to be serviced.(c) The evaluation criteria for existing programs (which may be subjectto change) will include all of the above factors, as well as the following:(1) The eligible entity's development, peformances and effectiveness inconducting the PTA Programs, including achievements against establishedgoals and any special achievements relative to small disadvantaged businessfirms.(2) The amount of subcontracting to private consultants.(d) As this program applies both to existing PTA Programs and to thosebeing planned, certain of these evaluation factors will be evaluated basedupon stated implementation policy for programs being planned. For example,the types and qualifications of personnel assigned will require applicantsthat do not presently have established but are planning programs to identifythe standards to be used in selecting the personnel.(e) The amount of subcontracting to private consultants is limited to nomore than 10% of total program costs for both existing programs and newstarts. In evaluating this factor for existing programs the smaller theamount of such subcontracting the greater the weight that will be given.However, in the case of new starts, equal weight will be given to all offers,subject only to the 10% limitation.7. DoD Funding(a) Any funds authorized for the PTA program will be allocated equitablyamong the nine DCASRs to cover the DoD share of the PTA program cost forexisting programs and for new starts. The SCAP will identify the totalamounts of funds authorized for the related fiscal year.(b) If there is an insufficient number of satisfactory proposals in a DCASRto allow effective use of the funds allocated, the Cooperative AgreementProgram Manager will reallocate the funds among the DCASRs based upon theaward recommendations made by the HQs DLA evaluation panel and CooperativeAgreement Policy Council.8. Cost Sharing Criteria and Limitations(a) The DoD share of net program costs shall not exceed 50%, except ina case where an eligible entity meets the criteria of a distressed area.When the prerequisite conditions to quality as a distressed areas are met,the DoD share may be increased to an amount not to exceed 75%. (b) In no event shall the DoD share of net program costs exceed $300,000for programs providing state-wide coverage and $150,000 for all other programs.(c) Cost contributions may be to either direct or indirect costs, providedsuch costs are otherwise allowable in accordance with the cost principlesapplicable to the award. Allowable costs which are absorbed by the eligibleentity as its share of costs may not be charged directly or indirectlyor may not have been charged in the past to the Federal Government underother contracts, agreements, or grants.(d) The SCAP will require applicants to submit an annualized estimatedbudget, which may include cash contributions, in-kind contributions, anyfees and service charges to be earned under the program, and any otherFederal Agency funding (including grants, loans, and cooperative agreements)authorized to be used for this program.(e) The type and value of any in-kind contribution will be limited to nomore than 25% of the total program cost.(f) Any fees, service changes or Federal funds provided under another Federalfinancial assistance award, including loans (but not including loan guaranteeagreements since these do not provide for disbursement of Federal funds)are not acceptable for calculating cost contributions of the eligible entity.Although the fees, service charges and other authorized federal funds mustbe included in the annualized estimated budget, they cannot be includedfor cost sharing purposes. Inclusion of other Federal funds in the programis subject to the terms of the award instrument containing such funds orwritten advice beging obtained from the awarding Agency(s) authorizingsuch use. Any method used by the eligible entity in providing the requiredfunds which relies upon Federal funds must be disclosed and identifiedin the eligible entity's proposal.(g) In submitting its budget, and eligible entity that services, or plansto service clients exclusively in areas that qualify as distressed areasmay submit a single budget and request a maximum of 75% as the DOD shareof net program costs (NPC), subject to paragraphs 8(a and b) above.
