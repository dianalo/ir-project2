Reacting to the fighting, President Daniel Ortega met with topofficials from the defense and interior ministries on Sunday, thelast of four registration days for the Feb. 25 general elections.   In the bloodiest attack, Contra rebels ambushed two truckscarrying military reservists Saturday near Rio Blanco, about 80miles northeast of Managua, military officials said. Eighteensoldiers were reported killed and eight wounded.   In a communique Monday, the president's office said, ``Criminalactions such as (Saturday's) ... will be punished with all theenergy and all the force that the laws of the republic allow forthis kind of offense.''   The statement did not say exactly what measures would be taken.   In separate remarks, Ortega accused the United States ofcreating obstacles to the electoral process.   ``They continue opposing demobilization of the Contras inHonduran territory, they continue promoting a policy ofstrangulation against Nicaragua and maintain financing of theContra armed mercenaries and now have approved financing of thedisarmed mercenaries,'' he said.   In February 1988, Congress cut off military aid to the Contrasbut it has continued non-lethal support, including $49 millionapproved earlier this year.   The latest aid package provides the Contras with food, medicine,shelter, boots and other supplies. It contains a clause, however,that allows the aid to be cut off if the Contras attack withinNicaraguan territory.   Most of the rebels are based in neighboring Honduras.   Col. Enrique Bermudez, the top Contra military leader, hasdenied the accusations by the leftist Sandinista government thathis troops in Nicaragua have been attacking.   Instead, he told The Associated Press in a telephone interviewfrom Honduras that the Sandinista army has been mounting a cleanupoperation against the rebels, who ``have to defend themselves.''   The government has claimed the rebels are trying to disrupt theelection process. It also says they have gained the support of theNicaraguan political opposition, which denies the charge.   Nicaraguans were allowed to register on the first four Sundaysin October. During the first three Sundays, the Supreme ElectoralCouncil said 1,336,342 citizens had registered of an estimatedtotal of 1,970,486 eligible voters.   A top U.N. official on an election observer mission said rebelattacks have impaired voter registration and expressed worry thatthe fighting may increase.   ``Regrettably, the electoral process is still marred in someplaces by the continuing armed actions of some groups,'' ElliotRichardson told reporters. The former U.S. attorney general isserving as a representative for U.N. Secretary General Javier Perezde Cuellar.   Electoral Council President Mariano Fiallos said at least 60registration places had not opened during the registration periodbecause of actual or threatened Contra attacks.   Ortega called early elections and pledged greater democracy inNicaragua in an accord with four other Central American leaders.   In exchange, they agreed to dismantling the Contras by Dec. 7,but the rebels say they won't disband until the Nicaraguangovernment guarantees a general amnesty.   Sandinista and Contra leaders signed a temporary cease-fire inMarch 1988. However, they have been unable to reach a permanentpeace agreement, and there has been sporadic fighting since then.</TEXT></DOC>
