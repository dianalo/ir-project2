(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A powerful new personal computer usinga new computer standard governing the accessories used in and withthe machine was announced Tuesday by Hewlett-Packard Co.   Dubbed the HP Vectra 486 PC, the floor-standing, 60-pound unituses a new standard developed by a consortium of nine computercompanies.   Last year, the group broke away from the latest standard ofInternational Business Machines Corp., in a challenge to IBM'scontrol of design standards for PCs that is based on its own,called Micro Channel, which is used in IBM's PS-2 computers.   The Vectra 486 _ the first to use the new standard dubbedExtended Industry Standard Architecture _ ``marks the beginning ofa new era in the PC industry and for HP as a supplier ofhigh-performance PCs,'' said Robert Puette, general manager ofHewlett-Packard's personal computer group.   The computer that will be available early next year comes inthree standard models priced at $13,999, $16,999 and $19,999.   Michael Slater, editor of Microprocessor Report, predicted thatcompetition would drive prices down later in 1990.   The Vectra 486 comes with two megabytes of memory, a floppy diskand choice of hard disks with various capabilities. It also haseight slots designed for add-in boards built for EISA.   ``In the past, users were forced to discard expensive DRAMs(dynamic random access microchips) when upgrading their PC'smemory,'' said Puette. ``With the new memory subsystem of the HPVectra 486 PC, HP is the first supplier to protect users' initialinvestment in PC memory.''   Hewlett-Packard is an international giant in computers andelectronics. The Palo Alto-based company posted revenue of $9.8billion in its 1988 fiscal year. It has 95,000 employees.</TEXT></DOC>
