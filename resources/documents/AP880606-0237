(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Rhode Island's unusually comprehensivemedical records dating back to 1970 will soon be available to helpdrug companies find out what conditions or other drugs may affecttheir products' use.   The computerized records, detailing every birth, death,diagnosis, hospital admission, hospital discharge and medicalcomplication of most of the stae's 980,500 residents, arecross-coded by age, race, sex and other demographics.   They will be sold to the pharmaceutical industry by Health DataResources, which is expected to be interested because ``the realworld is not at all like the pre-licensing test groups,'' accordingto John W. Norton, HDR president.   Pre-licensing tests required by the federal government usuallyexclude pregnant women, the very young, old, and those withunderlying conditions such as heart disease for ethical andpractical reasons. That exclusion means that drug companies may notlearn for years their products' effects.   Drugs being tested are usually ``given to only 1,000 or 2,000people who have only one disease and who aren't taking other drugs.It's given in only one dose and usually only for six months,''Norton said.   The companies will be able to study the results of only thosedrugs that have been licensed and are being marketed nationwide.</TEXT><HEAD>Company Plans To Test First Portable Kidney-Stone Smasher</HEAD><DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The first portable lithotripter, a machine thatuses shock waves to pulverize kidney stones inside the body withoutsurgery, will be tested soon in the United States, its maker says.   Most lithotripters now in widespread use are permanentlyinstalled in hospitals. Other mobile units are installed in trucks,and patients are wheeled inside for treatment.   Technomed International of Danvers, Mass., says its lithotripter,made in France, is the first small enough to be considered trulyportable. The one-ton machine can be rolled into a hospital by twotechnicians, where it will be used to treat patients and then movedto its next stop.   ``We take the machine off the truck and treat people in thehospital,'' said Sarah Sorrel, director of marketing.   The first of the $1.1 million machines will probably be sharedlater this summer by four or five hospitals in Washington state, shesaid.   The machine was introduced recently at an American UrologicalAssociation meeting here.</TEXT><HEAD>Kids Can Be Hurt By Bug Spray Doses OK For Adults</HEAD><DATELINE>ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   With insect season in full swing, aclinical pharmacist warns that children can suffer adverse reactionsfrom the amount of repellent that for adults just keeps the bugs off.   Bug sprays containing high amounts of the chemicaldiethyltoluamide can trigger reactions ranging from slurred speech,a staggering walk and agitation to seizures and tremors, says CaryE. Johnson of the University of Michigan.   Doctors often don't immediately link those symptoms to insectrepellent because they also can be caused by infections, tumors,Reye's Syndrome or other problems affecting the nervous system, saysJohnson.   He and Deborah L. Edwards began studying the effects of bug sprayafter helping to treat an 18-month-old girl who was admitted to C.S.Mott Children's Hospital with symptoms of weakness and lack ofcoordination. Her parents said they had been spraying her severaltimes a day to keep her from being bitten.   Children should get smaller doses than adults because their skinis more porous, and they are more likely to swallow the chemicalbecause they put their hands and fingers in their mouths, Johnsonreported in Clinical Pharmacy.</TEXT><HEAD>Milky Way Neighbor Seems To Contain Huge `Star Nurseries'</HEAD><DATELINE>BOULDER, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A galaxy next door to our Milky Wayapparently contains huge ``star nurseries,'' according to data froman ultraviolet space telescope launched as part of the effort tolearn how the universe was formed.   The $1 million telescope was pointed at Supernova 1987-A in thelarge Magellanic Cloud for some four minutes during a 154-mile-highsuborbital flight from Woomera, Australia on March 13, andidentified large amounts of hydrogen.   It is unusual to find molecular hydrogen in space except in cold,dense gas clouds where they are shielded from destruction, saidWebster Cash, designer of the telescope _ a prototype for the LymanFar Ultraviolet Spectroscobic Explorer planned for an extensivemission in the 1990s.   These interstellar clouds serve as nurseries for new starformation, which occurs when gravity pulls dense parts of the cloudsinward or when shock waves from exploding stars strike them, Cashsaid. ``The large Magellanic Cloud evidently contains a number ofstar-forming clouds.''   The telescope launched in March is the first to observe theultraviolet signature of molecular hydrogen outside the Milky Way,he said. It parachuted back to Earth and was recovered by NASA;scientists have proposed another launch in February to gather moreinformation.   Supernova 1987-A formed about 160,000 years ago from theexplosion of a star designated Sanduleak-69.202. Light from theblast reached Earth only in February, 1987. It is closer to Earththan any other supernova observed since one seen by Germanastronomer Johannes Kepler in 1604.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for June 9</NOTE></DOC>
