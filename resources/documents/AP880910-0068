One death was linked to the storm, an Alabama man who drownedFriday as he tried to secure a boat against the rising winds. Butproperty damage was less than expected.   The eye of the hurricane, about 30 miles wide, passed 30 mileseast of New Orleans around 3 a.m., then headed across LakePontchartrain, slightly west of the predicted path over the city ofSlidell.   Two hours later, the highest sustained winds were clocked at 60mph, and Florence was downgraded to a tropical storm. By 5:30 a.m.,the poorly defined remnants of the storm were just north ofHammond, moving toward Mississippi.   At 8 a.m., the National Hurricane Center downgraded Florence toa tropical depression and discontinued all warnings, although itadvised small craft to stay in port from Morgan City, La., toApalachicola.   Evacuation orders for Louisiana were lifted, allowing people toreturn home despite some high water.   ``We're still watching the tides, particularly from the west,but we don't think they will come up high enough to cause aproblem,'' Petrovich said.   Winds trailing the storm were expected to drive tides in themarshy regions around New Orleans as much as 9 feet above normal.   The threat of tornadoes remained. Tornado watches were postedalong the Gulf Coast from New Orleans east to Pensacola, Fla.   There were widespread power failures, including metropolitan NewOrleans, where about 30,000 people lost electricity. Power wasknocked out to 7,000 people in Plaquemeines Parish, Petrovich said.   There were no reports of major damage.   At Orange Beach, Ala., a 32-year-old man who didn't know how toswim drowned Friday when he fell into Cotton Bayou as he tried totie down a boat in wind and rain, said police Cpl. Marvin Glass.   Four men were stranded at the mouth of the Mississippi River,each on separate barges used in the offshore oil industry. Theywere trapped when the weather became too rough for the Coast Guardto rescue them.   ``They just rode it out,'' Petty Officer Steve Guy said thismorning. A rescue center maintained hourly contact with the men.   In St. Bernard Parish just east of New Orleans, the stormhampered efforts to fight three major house fires, said civildefense official Bob Bracamontes.   ``It's rough,'' Bracamontes said. ``These firemen out there nowhave a rough time trying to pull those hoses in this wind.''   Louisiana Gov. Buddy Roemer was to return today after cuttingshort a trip to Taiwan a day early. Louisiana Lt. Gov. Paul Hardyand Mississippi Lt. Gov. Brad Dye, whose boss Ray Mabus traveledwith Roemer, declared emergencies in parts of their states and puttheir National Guards on alert.   Alabama Gov. Guy Hunt declared a statewide emergency Friday.Alabama Emergency Management Director J. Danny Cooper said thedeclaration would allow officials to cope with the potential sideeffects of the hurricane, including the need for public sheltersand the possibility of tornadoes and flash floods.   Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis indefinitelypostponed an outdoor rally Friday in New Orleans as well as twoindoor fund-raisers _ a $1,000-per-couple cocktail party and a$10,000-per-couple buffet.   All along the coast, residents taped up windows and boarded uphomes before fleeing to evacuation centers.   ``It seems like you have to leave every time you turn around.We're evacuees,'' said Joe Gonzales, 66, of Delacroix Island. ``Youknow you're leaving home and you might not have a home to come backto.''   Others stocked up on water, canned goods and batteries to waitout the storm at home.   ``Once you make up your mind to stay, all you can do is stay,''said Curtis Mallon, a Dauphin Island, Ala., resident.   As many as 10,000 Mississippians headed for higher ground atevacuation centers or homes of friends or relatives, including sometropical storm novices.   ``It's all going to be quite an experience,'' said CharlotteCirec of Gulfport, Miss., who moved from Las Vegas two years ago.   In Florida and Louisiana, military planes were flown inland ormoved into hangars. The USS Lexington, a training aircraft carrierbased at Pensacola Naval Air Station, set out to the safety of opensea.   Florence, the sixth named storm of the 1988 Atlantic stormseason, is the second hurricane. The first, Debby, reached minimalhurricane strength briefly before hitting Mexican coast last month.   Florence hit land on the 23rd anniversary of Hurricane Betsy,which spilled its storm surge over levees and flooded eastern NewOrleans, killing 70 people in Louisiana and causing $1.1 billion indamage.   In the Caribbean early today, Tropical Storm Gilberto formedabout 250 miles south-southeast of San Juan, Puerto Rico, or atlatitude 15.1 north, longitude 64.2 west. Gilberto, packing windsof 40 mph, was moving to the west at near 15 mph.</TEXT></DOC>
