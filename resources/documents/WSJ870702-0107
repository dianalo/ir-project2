Chairman LeeIacocca, acknowledging &quot;mistakes&quot; in judgment, said Chryslerwill extend the warranty on vehicles it tested with theirodometers disconnected and will replace vehicles damagedduring testing but later sold as new.   The company is hoping to counter the public relations storm that followed last week's 16-count federal indictment of a Chrysler unit and two executives. In that indictment, the government charged Chrysler sold as new more than 60,000 cars and trucks that its employees allegedly had driven, sometimes as far as 400 miles, with the odometers detached.    Chrysler has admitted it disconnected the odometers during product testing but says it believes it did nothing illegal. &quot;We still think it's an outrageous indictment,&quot; a company lawyer said yesterday.    Whether illegal or not, Mr. Iacocca now says the practice, given that customers weren't informed, was &quot;just dumb&quot; and may have caused buyers to lose faith in Chrysler. Before a crowded news conference at the company's headquarters, he said that Chrysler's decision to sell as new cars damaged during testing &quot;went beyond dumb and reached all the way out to stupid.&quot;    &quot;The only law we broke was the law of common sense,&quot; Mr. Iacocca added.    To try to win back consumer confidence, the company is extending to seven years or 70,000 miles the engine and power-train warranty on those cars that it is certain were part of the test program. Chrysler said its records go back only to some 1984-model cars, though the program started decades before that. Most of the vehicles that are affected have a warranty of five years or 50,000 miles.    In addition, Chrysler said it will expand the warranty on the affected vehicles to cover additional major systems, such as brakes and air conditioning. Owners will also get a free inspection.    The company said it has identified 72 vehicles damaged during testing. Thirty-two of those were scrapped or sold as used. But 40 were repaired and sold as new, even though repairs in one case totaled $950. These vehicles will be replaced with new Chrysler models. The company said it is notifying dealers and owners, partly through a big advertising campaign it plans to kick off today.    &quot;It's the least that Chrysler owes to its consumers and its dealers,&quot; said Raphael Cohen, a former Chrysler dealer who now writes an industry newsletter. &quot;It hasn't been stated emphatically enough that they also deceived their dealers.&quot;    The company wouldn't say how much it expects the program to cost and was quick to note that it didn't view the effort as any type of legal settlement. &quot;This is not a product recall,&quot; Mr. Iacocca said. &quot;The only thing we're recalling here is our integrity.&quot;    In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Chrysler shares rose 37.5 cents to $34.50.    Chrysler is hoping to take the moral high road in the controversy by putting its strongest asset out front: Mr. Iacocca, who for seven years has been the company's chief barker and who is far and away the most recognized auto executive in the country. Dealers often acknowledge that customers buy Chrysler cars based first on their faith in the very public Mr. Iacocca, and second on the product's reputation.    Yesterday, the executive'slet's-talk-straight-with-each-other persona was in full gear.&quot;Did we screw up? You bet we did,&quot; he told reporters at thenews conference. &quot;I'm damned sorry it happened and you canbet it won't happen again, and that's a promise.&quot;   That folksy and direct apology will be carried in nationwide newspaper advertisements Chrysler plans to start placing today. The headline in one ad signed by Mr. Iacocca reads: &quot;Testing cars is a good idea. Disconnecting odometers is a lousy idea. That's a mistake we won't make again at Chrysler. Period.&quot;    Mr. Iacocca likened consumer doubt in the case to a &quot;cancer.&quot; Indeed, Chrysler's problems are far from over. The indictment, announced last week, carries with it a maximum fine of $120 million. Also, three class-action suits related to the case have been filed against the company, one each in Philadelphia, St. Louis and Alton, Ill.    Last October, when Chrysler was told of the Justice Department's investigation, the company changed its policy and tested cars only with odometers attached. Chrysler in 1981 had stopped disconnecting odometers during tests, chiefly because of technical problems. But dealers complained that cars were being delivered with mileage showing. So, Chrysler resumed detaching odometers that same year.    For his part, Mr. Iacocca said he knew the auto industry once tested with disconnected odometers but didn't know the practice still existed at Chrysler when he joined the company in 1978. He said he believes customers are chiefly angered about abuses of the program, including instances in which cars were taken on much longer trips than the normal 40-odd miles. In one case, a car flipped on its side, but was repaired and sold as new. </TEXT></DOC>
