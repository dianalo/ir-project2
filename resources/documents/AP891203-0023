Gorbachev moved closer together at their Mediterraneansummit to curb the nuclear and conventional arms races and drop thecurtain on the Cold War.   But they also discovered that the pace of events, especially inEastern Europe, is rapidly outstripping the capacity of the twomost powerful leaders in the world to shape the future.   Even as Bush and Gorbachev were winding up their two-daynear-summit on Sunday the entire Politburo and Communist partyCentral Committee resigned in East Germany. Orthodox communism ison the run, crumbling faster than anyone had predicted.   And while Bush was jetting here Thursday night from Washington afriendly but troubled government in the Philippines teetered on theedge of a military coup. Bush's preparations for the summit had tocompete with evaluating the threat to President Corazon Aquino andthe extent of U.S. military intervention deemed necessary toprotect her.   Even Mother Nature gave the two superpower leaders astomach-tossing display of how unpredictable the universe can be.Stormy seas forced them to rearrange their schedule and cancel botha Saturday afternoon meeting and a dinner that night.   Despite it all, Bush and Gorbachev found common ground on thedirection they would like the world to take, and that the roadahead is a long one. And while there were no arms-controlbreakthroughs or specific timetables set for treaty-signings, thetwo mutually pledged to work to that end.   ``We stated, both of us, that the world leaves the one epoch ofCold War and enters another epoch,'' Gorbachev said. ``This is justthe beginning. We are just at the very beginning of our long roadto a long-lasting peaceful period.''   The tentative nature of their joint venture is reflected in theabsence of any concrete agreements, and the evident failure of Bushto halt the delivery of Soviet arms to rebels in El Salvador.   The pipeline, which the administration claims runs through Cubaand Nicaragua, was denounced by Secretary of State James A. BakerII on the eve of the summit, as ``a relic of the Cold War.''   U.S. officials said Gorbachev, in discussing the explosive issuewith Bush, professed not to know how the anti-aircraft launchersand other arms got to the leftist FMLN forces.   Perhaps mindful of fast-paced events in East Germany and in allother Warsaw Pact countries except Romania, the Soviet leader alsospoke modestly of U.S. and Soviet powers to manage history.   ``In our position,'' Gorbachev said, ``the most dangerous thingis to exaggerate. We always should preserve elements ofcautiousness. I have used the favorite word of President Bush.''   The reference to Bush's political style draw laughter fromreporters assembled aboard the Soviet cruise ship Maxim Gorky.   But Bush was serious about the leaders' limitations as well asthe expectations for a meeting he refused to call a summit.   ``It is not for the United States and the Soviet Union to designthe future for Europeans,'' he said, ``or for any other people. Iam convinced that a cooperative U.S.-Soviet relationship can indeedmake the future safer and brighter.''   In that vein, Bush and Gorbachev determined to speed thecompletion of three arms control accords _ to banish chemicalweapons, reduce long-range nuclear missiles by 30 to 50 percent,and to reduce troops, tanks, artillery and other conventionalforces in Europe.   On the other hand, the summit produced no specific accords toattain those goals. Nor did the leaders establish a schedule forcompleting the three treaties, although they both said they hopedto place their signatures on a nuclear arms cut when they meet nextsummer in the United States.   It is one thing to urge negotiators on, and another to make thesort of command decisions that breaks deadlocks.   Gorbachev underscored how much remains to be done. For instance,he would like a ceiling placed on warships as part of thedisarmament process. Bush disagrees. The U.S. Navy will be reduced,but only by domestic budget constraints and not at the negotiatingtable.   And no deal was struck to limit nuclear-tipped cruise missilescarried aboard submarines and surface ships. That is the touchiestissue in the strategic weapons field.   On the conventional arms front, meanwhile, Gorbachev registeredthe Kremlin's complaint with NATO attempts to trim thousands ofSoviet airplanes that the Kremlin claims have a defense mission.   Repeatedly, however, Bush stressed the common ground he foundwith Gorbachev. He also made U.S. support for perestroika, therestructuring of the Soviet economy, concrete with an offer oftrading privileges.   ``It was a no agenda meeting, it accomplished everything I hopedit would,'' Bush said.</TEXT><NOTE>___</NOTE><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE: Barry Schweid has covered nine U.S.-Soviet</NOTE><TEXT>   summit meetings for The Associated Press.</TEXT></DOC>
