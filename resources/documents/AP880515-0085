The destroyer USS Merrill, two chartered tugboats and a seagoingcrane were sighted off the emirate of Sharjah, indicating an effortto retrieve the wreckage was under way, maritime salvage expertssaid.   In Washington, Lt. Col. Keith Schneider, a Pentagon spokesman,confirmed the wreckage of the Marine Corps AH-1 Cobra was locatedSunday.   He said the bodies of the two pilots _ Capt. Kenneth Hill, 33,of Thomasville, N.C., and Capt. Stephen Leslie, 30, of New Bern,N.C. _ were recovered.   They were the only American casualties in the fighting April 18,when U.S. naval forces destroyed two Iranian oil platforms and sankor disabled six naval craft. Iran said at the time that its forcesshot down the helicopter.   Tehran said 44 Iranians were killed during the clash.   The fighting began after U.S. forces earlier that day destroyedtwo Iranian oil platforms in retaliation for a mine explosion inthe gulf four days before that damaged the USS Samuel Roberts andwounded 10 sailors aboard.   The Navy had officially called off the search for the helicopterand declared the men killed in action. Memorial services later wereheld for the two Americans in Jacksonville, N.C., where their unitwas based.   The wreckage was located by a chartered salvage tugboat, saidthe salvage experts, speaking on condition of anonymity. Thewreckage was found in the general location where the raidsoccurred, they said.   The helicopter was on an evening patrol serving as backup forU.S. combat ships the day it disappeared. It was dispatched fromthe cruiser USS Wainwright.   In their last dispatch, the pilots radioed that they haddetected hostile radar tracking their aircraft.   The Iranians on April 23 claimed on their state-run radio thattheir Revolutionary Guards retrieved the some of the wreckage ofthe helicopter and brought it ashore.   The death of the two men brought to 46 the number of Americanskilled in and near the Persian Gulf in the past year. The figureincludes 37 killed in an erroneous Iraqi missile strike on thefrigate Stark May 17 last year. The others were killed inhelicopter crashes.</TEXT></DOC>
