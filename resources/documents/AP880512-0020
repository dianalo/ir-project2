(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The governors of Mississippi, Arkansasand Louisiana will join forces aboard a Mississippi River bargeFriday for a fight against the Delta region's depressed economy.   Govs. Ray Mabus of Mississippi, Bill Clinton of Arkansas andLouisiana's Buddy Roemer will sign an agreement to address chronicproblems of unemployment, illiteracy and poverty in the fertilefarmlands along the river.   ``We decided to use a barge for the signing so we could get tothe point where the three states come together,'' Mabus said. ``Wethought the coming together was symbolic.''   Mabus said he hoped the ceremony would mark ``the start of aregional economic development effort, one that will signal a newfocus on our region of the country and attract internationalinvestments and national attention to the three-state region.''   The governors will sign two agreements.   One will seek support for a congressional bill requestingfederal assistance for the region. ``We are going to try to presenta united front to Washington,'' Roemer said.   He said the states could share administration of some programsto help the area and he cited as an example the possibility ofschools in which children and their parents could be taught.   ``I can see a mother bringing her child to a first-grade classto read and write and go down to a hallway where she would learn toread and write,'' Roemer said.   The other agreement involves coordination of international tradeefforts and attempts to attract foreign investment, with the firsttarget country being Japan.   Clinton said the region has been devastated by national farmproblems that had dried up markets for Delta-grown soybeans, rice,milo and cotton. Industries that once offered jobs to displacedfarmhands have moved overseas in quest of cheaper labor.   Statistics show the Arkansas and Mississippi counties andLouisiana parishes in the Delta region _ the flatlands on bothsides of the river from Memphis to Natchez _ are among the nation'spoorest, many with poverty levels of above 50 percent.   Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., a sponsor of legislation to authorizefederal aid, said the Delta should be the target of an anti-povertycrusade similar to President Kennedy's effort to improve conditionsin Appalachia.   Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., said he hoped a federal study wouldproduce a report ``that will almost shame Congress into takingaction.''   Reps. Jamie Whitten and Mike Espy, D-Miss., have filed similarlegislation in the House.</TEXT></DOC>
