I amunaware of any documented cases of death by condom.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  ACKNOWLEDGE TEEN SEX, DON'T IGNORE IT  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Letters to the Editor  </MEMO><TEXT>     The true analogy for handing loaded guns to children lies in allowing themto continue in sexual activity without the protection and sexual educationthat they need.;   Teen-agers will continue to be sexually active and noamount of admonition by parents, church or the APA will alter that fact.;  Protecting lives is more important than protecting sensibilities.;   --PhillipHudson; Los Altos; CHILDREN NEED BETTER ROLE MODELS; I am totally disgustedwith ABC's upcoming presentation of Madonna, Cher and Michael Jackson on theso-called &quot;Family Channel.&quot;;   My position as a teacher at Terrell School inthe San Jose Unified School District gives me the opportunity to find out whomchildren admire. I don't like what I hear. So, I'm trying to counteract theseanti-heroes by bringing real, better role models to the campus. San JosePolice Officer Vincent Williams has come and Channel 11's Daniel Garza hasagreed to appear. I'm working on more.;   But that's not enough. ABC and itssponsors have to be told that we, the people, have strong objections tohigh-priced sleaze and vulgarity. We'll choose other channels or maybe none.If you agree, please call or write Channel 11's station manager, Stewart Park,and Dan Burke, President of the ABC Network in New York.;   -- Jane M.Sasseen; San Jose; STUFFED WALLETS; BUT NO COMPASSION; Your news story on Nov.11 about non-profits struggling for money really struck me.;   It somehowdoesn't make sense that there are more expensive cars on the road than everbefore, our hills are covered with huge and expensive homes, more people seemto have much more money and yet donations are down at this time.;   I wonder,is it the recession or is it an attitude? We have more money than ever before,but we seem less secure than ever and more afraid to share with those lessfortunate. Sometimes it seems the less we have, the more we share.;   --Berget Jelinch; San Jose  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911202  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  December  </MONTH><PG.COL>  4B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  406  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday, December 2, 199100337179,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
