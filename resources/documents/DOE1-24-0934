<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-24-0934 </DOCNO><TEXT>Since 1979, the Institutional Conservation Program's main emphasis hasbeen on funding capital improvements to increase the energy efficiencyof schools and hospitals. Improved building operation and maintenancetechniques as a means to reduce energy consumption have been encouraged,but despite evidence showing greatly increased energy savings from suchefforts, relatively little has been accomplished in this area. To meetthis deficiency, the Wisconsin Preventive Maintenance, Repair and OperationalServices (PROS) Pilot Program was designed to increase and maintain theenergy efficiency of schools by emphasizing building operation and maintenancetechniques within the context of an overall facility management program.The PROS final report provides complete documentation of the project'shistory, operations, methods, and results for those who might want toreplicate the program. Drawing upon Wisconsin's experience, this reportwill also indicate areas in which the program might be improved.</TEXT></DOC>
