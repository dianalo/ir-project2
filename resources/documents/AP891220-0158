AGUILAR</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   U.S. helicopter gunships and fighterjets thundered through the hot, moonlit night toward the caldron oflight surrounding Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega's headquarters.   They whined overhead before diving toward the strongman'scompound two miles east of the Diablo Heights promontoryoverlooking the Panama Canal.   Armored personnel carriers and truckloads of soldiers roared outof U.S. army bases on the roads below, surrounding the compoundwith the crackle of machine guns, the cough of mortars and theheavy thump of cannon.   The sky blazed with tracer fire and, eventually, glowed with thelight of a giant fire.   Daybreak revealed the compound reduced to rubble with onlyscattered shots still being fired. A pall of acrid smoke spreadslowly over the city, as scores of dazed survivors fled their homesin surrounding residential neighborhoods.   Hundreds of refugees _ men, women, and children _ could be seenin the street, walking in the tropical morning to churches,hospitals, and schools, in search of safety.   During the day the city turned into a scene of chaos. Armedtoughs who support Noriega took to the streets, some of themcommandeering cars. One resident said her car was stolen when a manput a gun to her head and demanded the keys.   Shortly before noon, the looting began. Even though sporadicshooting continued all over the Panamanian capital, there weredozens of people breaking into supermarkets and stores and makingoff with whatever they could lay their hands on.   Most of the looters were just poor people from the slums. Offthey went with stacks of food, cameras, home appliances, TV sets,mattresses and clothes.   Although a few scattered shots could be heard here and there, afestive atmosphere reigned as people walked away with food, tires,even refrigerators and stoves carried by four or five people at atime.   The major afternoon fighting, however, came in the San Miguelitoneighborhood to the northeast, a stronghold of the civilian``Dignity Battalions'' that Noriega had set up to help enforce hisrule.   Attack jets bombed and helicopters strafed a Defense Forcesbarracks on top of San Miguelito, and once again came the refugees,fleeing on foot or in their cars, if they could.   At dozens of U.S. Army checkpoints, those who wanted to pass hadto get out of their cars and drop to their knees while the vehiclewas thoroughly searched.   U.S. soldiers herded together about 300 Panamanian prisoners ina field near Albrook Air Base, at the foot of Diablo Heights.Relatives and friends of the captives waited across the street.   Many of the prisoners had been taken in raids on houses inDiablo Heights, a Panamanian neighborhood. Jeeps with mountedmachine guns had swept through the neighborhood during the night,stopping at certain houses and taking the men prisoner.   In one house, where four reporters were hiding along with theresidents, the owner said he had nothing to fear until his wifenoticed an 8-by-10 color photo of her husband as a student shakinghands with none other than Cuban President Fidel Castro.   She swiftly hid the photo, potentially offensive to Americaneyes, in their bedroom.</TEXT></DOC>
