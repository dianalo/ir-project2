Pretax profit rose to #406.5 million ($736.5 million) from #352.3 million a year earlier. The latest figure included a #3 million contribution from interest earnings, in contrast to payments a year earlier of #38.5 million.    Net income rose 19%, to #239.4 million from #200.4 million. Because of the disposal of businesses, sales fell 10%, to #2.48 billion ($4.49 billion) from #2.77 billion. Sales from continuing businesses rose 6.6%.    &quot;Our businesses are inherently strong, even though reported results were materially affected by currency, particularly the U.S. dollar,&quot; Beecham's chairman, Robert Bauman, said. At constant exchange rates, pretax profit would have risen 22%.    Even though the results approached market expectations, Beecham fell seven pence (12.7 cents), to 477 pence, on London's stock exchange yesterday. </TEXT></DOC>
