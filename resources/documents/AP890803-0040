(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A 19th century gold prospector may havebeen telling the truth, according to a team studying the man'sclaims he only killed one of his five prospecting companions.   Alferd Packer was convicted in 1885 of killing the other fivemembers of the party and was sentenced to 40 years in prison. But,although he admitted resorting to cannibalism to stay alive afterthe group became stranded in the snow, Packer maintained until hisdeath that he had killed only one.   A study of the prospectors' remains support that claim, WalterBirkby, curator of physical anthropology at the University ofArizona, said Wednesday.   The remains were exhumed last month from their resting place inthe Rockies near Lake City, Colo., and are being studied at theUniversity of Arizona.   Examinations of and tests on the bones of the five showed signsthat flesh was scraped off with a knife, Birkby said. The fourskulls removed from a common grave also showed signs of hatchetblows, he said.   The fifth skull was gone when the bones were buried in August1874.   Anthropologists have taken on the challenge to see if they candetermine the real story through scientific detection and see ifPacker was wrongly convicted.   Packer insisted he shot only one of the men and hit him in thehead with a hatchet in self defense. Packer said the man had killedthe four others with a hatchet.   Birkby said findings included a bullet hole in the pelvic boneof one of the skeletons.   The study team might be able to attach names to bones withfurther study of the remains, which include buttons, belt bucklesand some partially decomposed clothing, Birkby said.   The study team was assembled by James Starrs, a law professor atGeorge Washington University in Washington, D.C. Starrs has saidthat final results of the study will be detailed at the annualmeeting of the American Academy of Forensic Sciences in February.</TEXT></DOC>
