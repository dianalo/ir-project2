Robert Wallach, former confidant and personal legal adviser of ex-Attorney General Edwin Meese, was convicted of racketeering and conspiring to defraud the U.S. for his role in the Wedtech Corp. scandal.    Mr. Wallach's co-defendants, W. Franklyn Chinn and R. Kent London, were found guilty of racketeering, fraud and conspiracy. The three men were charged with receiving illegal payments from Wedtech in return for trying to influence Mr. Meese and other federal officials on behalf of Wedtech, a defunct defense contractor.    The verdicts mark the latest chapter of the Wedtech political corruption case, which earlier resulted in convictions of a former U.S. representative from New York, a former Bronx, N.Y., borough president and Wedtech executives.    Attorneys for Mr. Wallach, Mr. Chinn and Mr. London said they would appeal the convictions. Sentencing was set for Oct. 16.    Mr. Wallach began serving as an adviser to Wedtech in 1981. Mr. Chinn, formerly a financial adviser to Mr. Meese, and Mr. London became financial consultants to Wedtech in 1985.    In addition to prison sentences, the three face stiff forfeiture penalties because they were convicted under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Law. Under that act, they can be required to turn over all money they earned through the racketeering enterprise, which the government alleges amounted to $1.9 million.    The jury found Mr. Wallach guilty of receiving illegal payments totaling about $425,000 from Wedtech in return for using his influence in the Reagan administration to get contracts for the company. Mr. Meese, a longtime friend of Mr. Wallach, testified in the trial that Mr. Wallach had never sought preferential treatment for Wedtech.    Mr. Wallach testified that his role at Wedtech wasn't to help the South Bronx, N.Y., company get government contracts. Rather, Mr. Wallach said, the small, minority-owned company needed his advice and connections to get financial backing and legal assistance.    In his testimony, Mr. Wallach said Wedtech wanted his help because &quot;I could speak to the white world.&quot; He told the jury that Wedtech's South Bronx image made the company appear vulnerable and unsophisticated.    But Mario Moreno, former Wedtech Corp. vice chairman, testified that the money was paid in return for Mr. Wallach's promise that he would help the company later as an appointed official of the Justice Department. Although Mr. Wallach and Mr. Meese discussed the possibility of Mr. Wallach's joining the Justice Department, he was never offered the post.    Mr. Moreno, who earlier this year was sentenced to 18 months in jail for his role in a bribery and kickback scheme involving Wedtech, said the payments were treated as consulting fees but that Mr. Wallach never provided the specified services. The government charged Mr. Wallach, Mr. Chinn and Mr. London with conspiring to defraud the U.S. because government contracts were allegedly used to pay for those services that weren't provided.    The jury cleared Mr. Chinn and Mr. London of conspiring to defraud the government, but convicted them of RICO conspiracy charges.    Mr. Chinn was found guilty of defrauding the company by charging $23,763.77 of personal expenses to company credit cards.    In addition, Mr. Chinn and Mr. London were convicted of securities fraud and mail fraud.    Although Mr. Wallach was convicted of one RICO count, he wasn't found guilty of the RICO conspiracy count.    Mr. Wallach faces a maximum sentence of 45 years in prison. Mr. Chinn and Mr. London, who were both found guilty of two RICO counts, face as much as 40 years in prison each on the charges. They face additional sentences on the lesser charges.    After the proceedings ended, Mr. Wallach, his voice cracking, said, &quot;I am guilty of nothing, except being in the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong people.&quot; He called the racketeering charges against him &quot;a contortion of the law. The {RICO} law never was intended for cases of this kind.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
