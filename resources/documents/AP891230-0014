RAWSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Federal lawyers have dismissed William J. Keatingas a defendant in a $1.1 billion lawsuit stemming from the failureof a savings and loan run by his brother, millionaire Charles H.Keating Jr.   The lawsuit accused Charles Keating, several family members, andother senior executives of his American Continental Corp. ofdevising a scheme to loot money from Lincoln Savings and LoanAssociation of Irving, Calif., which American Continental owned.   Federal regulators seized the thrift April 14, one day afterAmerican Continental sought protection from its creditors underfederal bankruptcy law. The thrift's failure is expected to costtaxpayers more than $2 billion.   The Resolution Trust Corp., the federal agency created to cleanup the savings and loan industry, filed the lawsuit under civilfraud and racketeering statutes in U.S. District Court in September.   William Keating, chief executive officer of the DetroitNewspaper Agency and chairman of the board of The Associated Press,wasn't accused of fraud and racketeering but was named in three of15 counts and was accused of negligence and breach of fiduciaryduty.   William Keating served for five months in 1986 on AmericanContinental's board of directors, said his lawyer, Chester T. Kaminof Chicago.   Resolution Trust Corp. lawyers filed notice Friday in federalcourt that William Keating had been dismissed, without prejudice,as a defendant in the case.   Kamin said that because the dismissal is ``without prejudice,''William Keating theoretically could be reinstated as a defendant inthe case. But it is unlikely that he would have been dismissed ifthe government had any intention of including him in thelitigation, Kamin said.   Michael C. Manning, a Phoenix lawyer who has represented theResolution Trust Corporation in the case, wasn't available forcomment Friday. His secretary said he was on vacation.   P. John Owen, a Kansas City lawyer who signed the notice ofdismissal on behalf of the Resolution Trust Corporation, was out ofhis office and unavailable until Tuesday, his secretary said.</TEXT></DOC>
