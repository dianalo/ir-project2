Because $15 billion or more of long-term loans must be raised by whichever bidder wins the giant food company, they say, banks in lending syndicates for that deal may have trouble finding buyers in the secondary market for portions of their loans. &quot;Everybody who wants some will be able to get it on a primary basis,&quot; said one banker. So, &quot;anybody who buys expecting to sell it has to be prepared to sit on it.&quot;    At the same time, some federal bank regulators are voicing more-general concerns that aggressive newcomers vying to become lead banks in smaller LBO loan syndicates may take on excessive amounts of such loans that they can't sell off on the secondary market.    Some bankers said the size of the RJR Nabisco transaction already is having a chilling effect on their willingness to take part in other leveraged buy-outs.    Jamie Stewart, head of Mellon Bank's global merchant-banking group, said he is worried that the RJR buy-out may crowd out secondary-market demand for LBO loans generally. Because his bank sells off most of the loans in which it participates, Mellon is becoming more cautious. &quot;We are concerned,&quot; said Mr. Stewart, &quot;and we are going to be more conservative about doing deals until we have a sense of what will be the impact of this RJR deal.&quot;    Worries about saturation of the secondary market have &quot;affected our willingness to underwrite transactions,&quot; said Lincoln Morison Jr., Bank of Boston's deputy group executive for world banking. &quot;We are being more cautious.&quot;    &quot;There's a question of marketability here,&quot; agreed James McDermott, chief bank analyst for Keefe, Bruyette andamp; Woods.    Some say the current flurry of big transactions is indirectly deterring leveraged-buy-out lending by subjecting such loans to scrutiny by Congress and bank regulators. &quot;If I were a CEO of a bank, I'd be very skittish about taking these loans,&quot; said Stephen Skaags, an analyst for Sheshunoff andamp; Co.    Concern expressed by the Comptroller of the Currency wasn't sparked by the battle for control of RJR Nabisco, but by a survey last summer of leveraged-buy-out lending at 11 multinational and five regional banks. The comptroller plans to urge banks to take great care in evaluating such loans.    Stephen Lane, senior financial analyst for the comptroller's office, said he worries that the credit-worthiness of the transactions is declining. He cited the growing ratio of debt to equity or to cash flow and the leveraging of companies with cyclical earnings, which are more vulnerable to recession. He said some companies have emerged from buy-outs with negative net worth. And a colleague at the comptroller's office, who declined to be identified, called it &quot;insanity what people are willing to pay for a company&quot; in some instances.    Michael LaRusso, senior national bank examiner for the Comptroller of the Currency, said he worries that relative newcomers to LBO lending lack the experience of the bigger banks in evaluating the risks in such loans and pricing them appropriately.    &quot;More and more banks are jockeying to be the lead bank,&quot; said Mr. LaRusso. &quot;There's a lot of anxiety to be in this business.&quot;    To become a lead bank, &quot;you have to be able to offer something,&quot; he said. That may tempt aggressive banks to compromise their pricing or credit standards, Mr. LaRusso added.    &quot;They may commit to do a $1 billion deal and then not have the capacity to get rid of it&quot; by selling portions to other lenders, he said. &quot;That may be due to the fact that it is not priced properly, is a weaker credit, or they just don't have the reputation as a lead bank to get other companies to come into a deal.&quot;    &quot;Their concern is well placed,&quot; said Fred Beard, executive vice president, corporate banking, at Mellon Bank. Lead lenders often have to take on more of the loan than they intend to keep when transactions have to be done quickly, he noted.    An RJR management group is offering to take the Atlanta-based tobacco and food giant private in a $21.16 billion leveraged buy-out, the biggest ever. It's estimated that banks would need to provide as much as $15 billion in loans for the transaction. Meanwhile, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., a New York LBO specialist, is bidding $20.6 billion for RJR. Bank financing is expected to be needed for half that amount. A third possible bidder, buy-out specialist Forstmann, Little andamp; Co., is in the wings and most likely also would need bank financing.    Bank of Boston has been cautious about leveraged-buy-out lending for more than a year, Mr. Morison said. He emphasized that he expects the financing of corporate acquisitions to remain good business for banks. &quot;The trick is to avoid the excesses.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
