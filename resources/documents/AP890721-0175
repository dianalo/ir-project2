The briefcase transfer was recorded in Vienna, where theofficial in question, Felix S. Bloch, first had contact with theSoviets three years ago, ABC News reported.   There was no answer at Bloch's Washington home Friday night.John McWethy, the ABC reporter on the story, said Bloch declined tocomment when reached earlier.   Bloch, a 30-year-career employee, has been placed on leave, hisbuilding pass withdrawn and his security clearance revoked, thedepartment said in a statement.   Officials weren't immediately sure, but it could be the firsttime a U.S. diplomat has been involved in an espionage case sincethe famous Hiss case of the late 1940s. There have been other casesinvolving military personnel attached to embassies.   Bloch was director of the office of regional political-economicaffairs in the department's Bureau of European and CanadianAffairs. In that position, he would have been involved in almostanything that dealt with two or more European countries, includingthe Soviet Union.   In Vienna, he had been deputy chief of mission, the No. 2official in the embassy, and would have had access to all theembassy's activities and communications.   Vienna has been the site of the long-running and largelyunfruitful talks on conventional arms reduction in Europe, theMutual Balanced Force Reduction talks between the NATO alliance andthe Warsaw Pact.   Bloch returned from Vienna about two months ago, when he was``picked up'' by FBI agents, ABC said.   A department source who knows Bloch and who spoke on conditionof anonymity said he believed that was a reference to Blochreturning from a trip to Vienna. Bloch had completed his Viennaassignment and returned to work in Washingt about a year ago, thissource said.   But Bloch has not been charged with anything. The network showedpictures of men in cars at his home who, it said, were FBI agentskeeping him under 24-hour surveillance.   Soviet agents also have been watching Bloch, ABC said.   Bloch was not home. His apartment is across the hall in anelegant 32-unit building from the former home of Supreme CourtJustice Sandra Day O'Connor.   No surveillance cars were in evidence Friday night, but aneighbor, Preston Pitts, said the cars had been around for at leastthree weeks.   ``They were everywhere, like ants,'' said Pitts.   Pitts said Bloch told him three or four months ago he was inline for a nomination as ambassador to a South American country.When the surveillance teams showed up, Pitts said, he asked Blochif they were bodyguards and if he were in danger, but Bloch said no.   Neither Bloch, his wife Lou nor a daughter in her 20s had beenseen since Thursday, Pitts said.   Bloch, a native of Austria, turned 54 on Wednesday. He holds abachelor's degree from the University of Pennsylvania and amaster's degree from the University of California at Berkeley.   The last public edition of the department's biographicalregister, published in 1974, said Bloch had served in Berlin,Dusseldorf, West Germany and in Caracas, Venezuela.   The department source who knows Bloch said he served as economiccounselor at the U.S. embassy in East Berlin in 1974-1975, andlater in Singapore.   A colleague in Bloch's office refused to discuss him whenreached Friday night.   In a statement read by spokeswoman Anita Stockman, the StateDepartment said it was ``pursuing the inquiry thoroughly in orderto identify the compromised security which has occurred and theappropriate legal steps.''   Ms. Stockman said it was premature to speculate on what secretsmight have been compromised.   The network said State Department investigators believed Blochhad not been motivated by money, and were speculating that he wasdismayed that after 30 years he had not reached the rank ofambassador.   Alger Hiss, who had been a high department official, secretaryof the founding conference of the United Nations and adviser toPresident Roosevelt at the World War II Yalta conference withBritain and the Soviet Union, was publicly accused of espionage in1948 by writer Whittaker Chambers.   Chambers said Hiss passed him secret documents to pass on toSoviet spies.   A celebrated congressional investigation into the case propelleda young congressman in charge, Richard Nixon, into the nationalspotlight.   Hiss denied everything, but was convicted of perjury and serveda prison sentence.</TEXT></DOC>
