It was the third increase in the benchmark rate in less thanthree weeks and represented a concerted effort by Prime MinisterMargaret Thatcher's Conservative government to curb inflationarypressures and boost the pound.   The Bank of England signaled the increase by raising a key moneymarket intervention rate.   Barclays Bank PLC responded immediately by raising its base ratefrom 8.5 percent to 9 percent, effective Thursday. Midland BankPLC, National Westminster Bank PLC and Lloyds Bank PLC quicklyfollowed suit.   Corporate borrowers can obtain loans from commercial banks at 1percentage point above the base lending rate.   There was little reaction in financial markets to the increase.The pound was slightly higher but dealers said the currency'sresponse was restricted because the rate hike had already beendiscounted.
