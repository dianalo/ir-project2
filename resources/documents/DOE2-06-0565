At this critical limit {theta} begins to rapidly cant tosmaller values until, at compositions approaching Cr/sub 2/TeO/sub 6/,it approaches a parallel orientation to the basal plane. The /sup 125/Teand /sup 129/I Moessbauer spectra recorded from the compound FeCrTeO/sub6/ at 77 and 4.2 K are consistent with the presence of a supertransferredmagnetic hyperfine field at the tellurium nucleus of ca. 76 kG.</TEXT></DOC>
