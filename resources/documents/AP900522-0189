Security Council will meet Friday inGeneva to hear PLO chairman Yasser Arafat because the U.S.government has not granted him a visa to speak in New York, theArab League announced late Tuesday.   ``Yes, we definitely will go to Geneva,'' said Clovis Maksoud,permanent observer of the 22-nation League of Arab States. He madethe statement to reporters as the Security Council held informalconsultations on an emergency meeting to discuss violence in Israeland the occupied territories.   The council was expected to make a formal statement later.   The U.S. government had not accepted or rejected the request fora visa for the Palestine Liberation Organization leader.   But Arab diplomats indicated the United States did not oppose amove to Geneva.   The PLO requested an immediate U.S. visa for Arafat, who isconsidered the head of the Palestine state, to address the SecurityCouncil in New York.   Arab envoys said they decided on the Geneva move in order toconsider the pressing issue of how the council can help safeguardthe rights of Palestinians.   ``We do not seek confrontation, we are seeking protectivemeasures for the Palestinian people,'' Maksoud told reporters. ``Wedid not back down. No deal has been done with the United States (onnot forcing the visa issue).''   Arafat last visited the United States in 1974 when he addressedthe General Assembly on Palestine.   Two years ago the United States refused to grant him a visa toaddress the assembly about the Palestine problem, on grounds hiswas a terrorist organization. The assembly in defiance shifted the159-nation assembly to Geneva to hear him.   There, in December 1988, Arafat delivered a speech that opened anew chapter in Middle East diplomacy. He renounced terrorism andimplicitly recognized Israel's right to exist within secure borders.   As a result of his statement, the United States opened adialogue with the PLO in Tunis.   The Security Council has met outside New York only twice: inJanuary 1972 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, to discuss African matters,and March 1973 in Panama City to discuss the Panama Canal.</TEXT></DOC>
