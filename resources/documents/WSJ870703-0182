The question isn't whether the measure will pass -- enactment is considered certain -- but how much cash it will require from the U.S. Treasury.    Neither Chrysler nor Lockheed got a direct infusion of federal cash. Both got federal loan guarantees -- $1.2 billion for Chrysler, $250 million for Lockheed. This time, some cold cash will be involved. Lawmakers hope to hold it down to a few hundred million dollars by using guarantees and by requiring a waste-cutting overhaul of the Farm Credit banks.    By most estimates the Farm Credit System will need, all told, $5 billion to $6 billion in federal backing. The two congressional agriculture committees are working on bills that will probably wind up in that range. Meanwhile, the Reagan administration has unveiled its own proposal, a Treasury plan for financial support that could exceed $10 billion. Like the lawmakers, administration officials want an overhaul of the system and believe that only a small percentage of the money would then have to be doled out.    Senate and House leaders hope to have a bill on President Reagan's desk by October. There is &quot;no alternative,&quot; says Brent Beesley, the head of the Farm Credit Corp. of America, the Denver-based umbrella group that serves as the Farm Credit System's spokesman. With the farm economy in the doldrums, the system -- a loosely knit network of privately owned agricultural lending banks that makes about a third of all farm loans in the U.S. -- has lost $4.8 billion since early 1985. It could easily plunge a further $3 billion into the red between now and 1989.    But the rescue effort will be painful and fraught with emotionally charged political infighting. The Farm Credit System and the federal agency that regulates it, the Farm Credit Administration, are already in a lobbying war over their roles in any bailout. And Congress itself is torn between two sharply conflicting goals -- a desire to protect farmer-borrowers and a requirement that it hew to the spending limits set by the Gramm-Rudman budget-balancing legislation.    At the same time, lawmakers are angered that the system's management hasn't done more to solve its problems.    What with all the pressures, coming up with a solution is &quot;pretty darned tough,&quot; concedes Rep. Kika de la Garza, the Texas Democrat who heads the House Agriculture Committee. He says, &quot;It looks like this is going to provide the same kind of challenge that reporting out a major farm bill would pose.&quot;    To make matters worse, the lawmakers are racing against the clock. Without new support from the federal government, at least 10 of the system's 37 credit banks are expected to go belly-up by year-end, a development that could quickly weaken the rest of the system. Warns GOP Rep. Fred Grandy of Iowa: &quot;We may well find as we work through this legislation that the clock is ticking faster than we believe.&quot;    Not surprisingly, Congress has been deluged with bailout proposals: Mr. Beesley's Farm Credit Corp. wants lawmakers to provide the Farm Credit System with a $6 billion direct line of credit from the Treasury. Several farm groups have recommended a cash infusion designed to bolster farmers rather than the system. The Treasury's plan would set up a debt reserve fund that the system could eventually draw on. Some lawmakers want to create a federally backed resale market for agricultural loans, dubbed Farmer Mac or Aggie Mae. And almost everybody wants tough new restructuring requirements for the system's management.    Despite previous attempts by Congress in 1985 and 1986 to handle the problems, the crisis at the Farm Credit System banks, which are federally chartered but not federally financed or insured, has been worsening for years.    The problem is similar to the one that has plagued the nation's thrift institutions. (In fact, Congress is also working on a proposed bailout of the federal insurance for thrifts, and its magnitude could rival that of the Farm Credit bailout.) During the agriculture spree of the late 1970s and early 1980s, Farm Credit System banks poured out inflation-linked loans that went sour when the farm economy collapsed and farmland values plummeted. To deal with this, they have had to keep interest rates high, prompting a flight by would-be borrowers. And, critics say, the system has been rife with bad management and spending excesses.    Part of the problem lies in the system's own cumbersome makeup. The system divides the nation into 12 farm credit districts. Each district contains a federal land bank that makes long-term farm loans, an intermediate credit bank for short-term operating loans, and a special bank to lend money to farm cooperatives. But while the banks -- and their hundreds of affiliated associations, which work as near-autonomous branch offices -- are supposed to function as a cooperative, they are privately owned and very independent.    In 1985, Congress tried to tie the whole system closer together by creating the Farm Credit Capital Corp., situated in Kansas City, Mo., to oversee a self-help effort by which stronger banks in the Farm Credit System cooperative transfer some of their surpluses to help weaker institutions.    &quot;We're the system's official Robin Hood -- taking from the richer banks and giving it to the poor,&quot; says William BeSore, the agency's senior vice president for finance.    Significantly, the Farm Credit Capital Corp. hasn't joined in asking the government to bail out the Farm Credit System. Although the corporation has been silent on the issue, its officials are said to believe that the system can still make it on its own with federally ordered management changes.    Nevertheless, the system faces some severe, &quot;almost unsolvable&quot; problems, Mr. BeSore concedes. &quot;If there is a solution,&quot; he says, &quot;it will be through the narrowest of holes.&quot;    The system is burdened with a huge portfolio of bad -- or at least delinquent -- loans. About a quarter of its $54.6 billion in outstanding loans are delinquent, and authorities expect that an additional $6.8 billion worth won't be repaid at all. It is also saddled with excessive overhead -- administrative expenses alone exceed $800 million a year -- and high debt costs. Some $18 billion of its own debt is in long-term securities that will require it to pay 11% or more through 1990.    The rub is, there aren't any easy solutions. To begin with, almost any multibillion-dollar federal bailout effort runs afoul of the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction targets -- and the other proposed bailout in the works, that of the federal insurance for thrifts, could top $8.5 billion, though the final total is uncertain and could be less. Moreover, the agriculture committees' desire to protect farmers from any losses, such as those that would result from foreclosures on bad loans, could lead the panels to incorporate safeguards that might double the price tag of $5 billion to $6 billion.    Ordinarily, Congress might require stockholders to share in the system's loss under such a bailout. In the case of the Farm Credit System, however, borrowers have been required to buy stock in lieu of a lending fee. Few were told they might ever have to take a beating. The House and Senate are almost certain to provide full protection for existing stockholders.    The idea of creating a secondary, or resale, market for agricultural loans also faces opposition. The Treasury contends it would only worsen the situation by luring away the Farm Credit System's few remaining viable loans and would expose the federal government to more risk. Besides, &quot;the Farm Credit System itself already amounts to a secondary market,&quot; says Charles Sethness, an assistant Treasury secretary.    The real battle is expected to be over who will control the Farm Credit System once the bailout is under way. Both the Reagan administration and the General Accounting Office, Congress's own watchdog, have recommended creating a blue-ribbon board to administer any new bailout effort -- similar to the panel that oversaw the government's loan guarantee to Chrysler -- with power to order the kind of sweeping restructuring that the system itself hasn't been able to perform.    But the Farm Credit Administration, as the system's regulator, wants to be given such authority itself. And the Farm Credit System, whose 37 independent banks and 387 credit associations are loath to give up their longstanding local control and autonomy, wants any such board to have only limited powers at best.    Lawmakers are angered by the system's failure to help itself under previous legislation. Just last year, Congress gave the credit banks an accounting reprieve: It allowed them to defer their losses over 20 years to keep their balance sheets in the black. Optimism reigned. The system's leaders promised a turnaround.    The turnaround never came. The Farm Credit System's losses have continued to mount as the banks, locked into paying premium prices for their own capital and therefore keeping their interest rates higher than those of most other lenders, saw their more credit-worthy borrowers flee to those lenders. The system's surplus capital -- its major cushion in case of further losses -- has shrunk to $1.2 billion, from $6.2 billion in 1984.    To top that off, Congress's bid to force stronger banks in the system to help the weaker ones has been stymied by the courts. A spate of legal challenges by dissident banks in the system has cast a cloud over the Farm Credit Administration's power to enforce the congressional mandate. The fact that the system thus is unable to use some of its own funds to plug its financial drains, warns Jerome Weiss, a former general counsel for the Farm Credit System, makes it more vulnerable.    Experts are divided on why the self-help effort hasn't worked. &quot;I wish I had a good answer to that,&quot; says Frank Naylor, the chairman of the Farm Credit Administration.    Lawmakers now are convinced that the present system must be completely revamped to create a management structure that is capable of ordering the needed changes. The chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, Patrick Leahy of Vermont, bridles at what he calls &quot;the excesses in expenditures and procedures&quot; by the system's management. &quot;I have no intention of letting a bill go through,&quot; he says, &quot;unless I can see some major reforms in the system.&quot;    The administration is pushing to allow the system's banks to compete in one another's districts and require that all of them recruit some outside directors.    Meanwhile, all sides are stepping up their lobbying, making almost daily visits to Capitol Hill. &quot;From the extremes I hear, there has to be some middle ground, but I don't know what it is,&quot; says Mr. de la Garza, the chairman of the House committee. Congress has exhausted the easy alternatives, he says, adding: &quot;From now on, it is going to cost somebody.&quot;    ---              The Farm Credit System At a Glance                   (In billions of dollars)                          1984     1985     1986     1987* Outstanding loans       $81.1    $66.6    $54.6    $48.0 Delinquent loans          1.8      5.3      7.1      6.2 Overhead costs             .872     .883     .792     .836 Net profit (loss)          .373   (2.7)    (1.9)    (1.3) Surplus capital           6.2      3.4      1.5      1.2 *Projected Source: Farm Credit Corp. of America</TEXT></DOC>
