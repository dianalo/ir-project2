Police said the three, a married couple and a friend, werekilled as they tried to escape the low-income neighborhood of EinRummaneh about noon.   Earlier in the day, police said rescuers took 42 bullet-riddledcorpses from east Beirut districts that were the scenes of most ofthe savage fighting.   The command of renegade Gen. Michel Aoun also reported thedeaths of 10 soldiers and two officers in the last two days ofhostilities.   That brought the overall casualties to 430 killed and 1,680wounded in the worst intra-Christian conflict of the 15-year civilwar, pitting Aoun's soldiers against Samir Geagea's Lebanese Forcesmilitiamen.   A police spokesman, who cannot be named under standingregulations, said the factions blamed each other for provoking theintermittent skirmishes across confrontation lines dividing theChristian enclave in east Beirut.   The shooting forced Maronite Catholic churches to cancelservices on the occasion of St. Maroun's day, the patron saint ofthe sect.   Mass was celebrated instead in the studios of the Voice ofLebanon radio station in east Beirut's Ashrafiyeh neighborhood. Itwas said by Archbishop Khalil Abi Nader, an aide to MaronitePatriarch Nasrallah Sfeir, and was broadcast live.   The French Embassy, based in east Beirut, issued a statementsaying France's minister for humanitarian affairs, BernardKouchner, would try ``to pursue efforts aimed at stabilizing acease-fire in Lebanon.''   A French source, who refused to be further identified, saidKouchner, who had sponsored the evacuation of 16 wounded victimsfrom east Beirut for treatment in France, was ``not optimisticabout the future of the cease-fire.''   The police spokesman also said the combatants ``do not seem tobe preparing to withdraw.''   ``The tanks are still in combat formation. Fighters are still infiring positions. These are not indications that a truce is in themaking,'' he said.   Papal Nuncio Pablo Puente, who had launched repeated efforts tohalt the bloodshed, left Beirut to undergo an operation that he hadpostponed for a long time, a statement said. It did not elaborate.   A security committee grouping representatives of Geagea and Aounheld a two-hour meeting in Bkirki north of Beirut.   A statement afterward said both sides assured Puente, whoattended the meeting, that they would strictly adhere to acease-fire. They also agreed on reopening the Christian enclave'sthree main highways.   More than a half-dozen previous cease-fires have collapsed.   ``This is your last chance. His holiness Pope John Paul IIinsists there will not be a second chance. You have to resolve yourdifference on a basis of coordination in military affairs andplurality in political affairs,'' the statement quoted Puente astelling committee members.   The clashes in the Christian enclave have forced hundreds ofcivilians to flee to safety in Moslem west Beirut and other areasoutside the enclave.   The fighting between rival Christian forces for control of theChristian heartland is the latest in the 15-year cycle of sectarianbloodshed.   Aoun has refused to recognize a Syrian-backed Christian-Moslemgovernment and has battled to drive out Syrian troops siding withMoslem militias in west Beirut.   Rival Shiite Moslem factions also have battled intermittentlyfor control of Beirut's southern slums.</TEXT></DOC>
