Plasma osmolality and plasma concentrationsof Na and chloride decreased in fish from both lakes during acid exposures.Significant differences between the populations were observed at pH 4.1and 4.5. Hematocrits of the fish from the acid lake increased rapidlyand at higher pH compared with those of fish from the neutral lake. Thiswas interpreted as an adaptation to their normal acidic environment,connected with the maintenance of red cell oxygen affinity. The perchfrom the acid lake maintained their muscle water balance at lower pHbetter than did the fish from the neutral lake. 21 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
