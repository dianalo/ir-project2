The USS Houston sliced the net Friday night outside Los AngelesHarbor as the craft headed home on the surface for San Diego aftertaking part in filming of the movie ``The Hunt for Red October,''said Lt. Sonja Hedley, a Navy spokeswoman.   Hedley would not give the sub's precise location but said thefishing boat ``was in the traffic lane you shouldn't be in ...trawling.''   However, she added: ``If we cut his net, we'll pay for his netand that's all there is to it. People cross fishing nets like thatand clip them all the time.''   Capt. James C. Card, commander of the Coast Guard's Marine SafetyOffice, said the fisherman's description of his location would haveplaced the trawler in a legal spot just outside the shippingchannels.   On Wednesday, the fast-attack sub snagged a tow cable and pulleda tugboat to the ocean bottom, killing a tug pilot.   John M. Emirzian, skipper of the 33-foot trawler, said the subcut a new $3,800 net and cost him a two-day catch.   ``There was a million deck lights on,'' he said. ``It looked likeChicago out there. All they had to do was look.''</TEXT></DOC>
