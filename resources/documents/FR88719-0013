EPA, however, failed to modifya number of other sections in the CFR which refer to the farmer exemptionby section. Then, on July 8, 1987, EPA sought to amend the farmer exemptionto make it clear that farmers who were otherwise exempt from hazardouswaste regulations were also exempt from the land disposal restrictions.In doing so, however, EPA inadvertently moved the farmer exemption backto its old section (which was already occupied by the export regulations).Today's amendments will correct these errors.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>July 19, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>RCRA Hotline, toll free (800)424-9346 or (202) 382-3000.

Technical Corrections</ITAG>The following amendments are promulgated today in 40 CFR:1. Section 262.10(b) is amended by changing the reference ``andSection; 262.51''to andSection; 262.70;''2. Section 262.10(d) is amended by changing the reference ``andSection; 262.51''to ``andSection; 262.70'' and by adding ``Part 268'' (the land disposal restrictions)to the list of Parts farmers are exempt from;3. Section 262.51 is revised so that it contains the definitions for thehazardous waste export regulations. This change was made on August 8, 1986(51 FR 28664), but then the Agency inadvertently revised the section onJuly 8, 1987 (52 FR 25760);4. Section 262.70 is amended so that ``Part 268'' (the land disposal restrictions)is added to the Parts a farmer may be exempt from. The Agency attemptedto make this change July 8, 1987 (52 FR 25760), but mistakenly amendedthe wrong section;5. Section 264.1(g)(4) is amended by changing the reference from ``andSection;262.51'' to ``andSection; 262.70;''6. Section 265.1(c)(8) is amended by changing the reference from ``andSection;262.51'' to andSection; 262.70;''7. Section 268.1(c)(5) is amended by changing the reference from ``andSection;262.51'' to ``andSection; 262.70;''8. Section 270.1(c)(2)(ii) is amended by changing the reference from ``andSection;262.51'' to ``andSection; 262.70.''These amendments correct cross-references in the regulations and correctchanges in the regulations made by mistake. All of the provisions wereoriginally promulgated after public notice and opportunity for commentand there are no new issues raised by these corrections. In addition, theseamendments do not impose any new substantive requirements on any persons.For these reasons, the Agency has good cause under RCRA andSection; 3010and the Administrative Procedure Act for making these amendments immediatelyeffective without additional public notice and opportunity for comment.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Regulatory Impacts</ITAG>The regulations promulgated today are merely renumbering actions and sohave no impacts on the regulated community.A. Executive Order No. 12291_Regulatory ImpactsUnder Executive Order No. 12291, EPA must determine whether a regulationis ``major'' and thus is subject to the requirement to prepare a regulatoryimpact analysis. Today's amendment merely corrects CFR section numberingerrors and does not impose new requirements, so it does not have an economicimpact.B. Regulatory Flexibility ActUnder the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., EPA must preparea regulatory flexibility analysis for all proposed rules unless the Administratorcertifies that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantialnumber of small entities. Accordingly, I hereby certify, pursuant to 5U.S.C. 601(b), that this rule will not have a significant impact on a substantialnumber of small entities because it merely involves renumbering actions,and so does not change previously existing rules.C. Paperwork Reduction ActUnder the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq., EPA must considerthe paperwork burden imposed by any information collection request in aproposed or final rule. This rule will not impose any new information collectionrequirements.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects for Parts 262, 264, 265, and 270</ITAG>Hazardous waste, Exports, Farmer exemption.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: July 13, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">J.W.
