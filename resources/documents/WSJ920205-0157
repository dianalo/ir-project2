The Board ofCosmetology.</LP><TEXT>   CLINT BOLICK: The board is comprised by law exclusively ofcosmetologists who practice in this field.   JUDGE SPORKIN: Some world we live in. Someone trying tomake a living and -- it's like Russia, isn't it?   MR. BOLICK: It's like Russia used to be.                                                                                                          This court hearing last month is part of the battle foreconomic rights under the Constitution, which Mr. Uqdah hopeswill stop regulators from closing down his hair-braidingsalon. It says something about the times that Mr. Uqdah, ablack-nationalist capitalist, has as his lawyer Mr. Bolick, acivil-rights lawyer whose mentor and younger son's godfatheris Justice Clarence Thomas.   Federal District Court Judge Sporkin blocked acease-and-desist order against Mr. Uqdah pending more courtarguments today. At issue is a 1938 law passed by Congress tocreate a &quot;Board of Cosmetology&quot; for Washington, D.C., tolicense beauticians. Mr. Uqdah's Cornrows andamp; Co. has beenunder regulatory attack by the cosmetology board since hissalon started in 1980. Regulators fined Cornrows $1,000 andordered it to close unless Mr. Uqdah complies withcosmetology regulations.   &quot;We're not talking about gene splicing or test-tube babiesor something complicated here,&quot; Mr. Uqdah explained in hisshop, part of his home in northwest Washington. &quot;We'retalking about hair-braiding.&quot; Still, there's a possibleprison term. &quot;If I'm supposed to go to jail for operating asalon without a license,&quot; he said with a laugh acknowledgingthe absurdity of the thought, &quot;I'll deal with that.&quot; He couldalso do for discriminatory regulations what Rosa Parks didfor segregated buses.   Mr. Uqdah and his wife, Pamela Farrell, specialize incornrows and braids, which they call &quot;an integral part of ourAfrican culture.&quot; Customers pay $85 to $1,000. The firm sellsvideos and stylebooks, has a toll-free phone number forquestions about children's hair, employs eight and grossesabout $500,000 a year. Ms. Farrell has trained some 250braiders, several of whom are now competitors.   The problem is that it takes $5,000 and nine months ofstudy to get a beautician's license, but the cosmetologyboard's rules have little to do with Cornrow's business. Thebeautician exam includes finger waves, which were popular inthe 1930s, and pin curls from the 1950s, but nothing aboutbraiding.   Mr. Uqdah says his shop doesn't use chemicals or otherpotentially dangerous materials or techniques. Yet lawyersfor the regulators say it is &quot;beyond peradventure that theseregulations are for the public benefit in terms of publichealth, welfare and safety.&quot;   Make that somewhere this side of peradventure. Thetendency of people in trades to use licensing laws to blockcompetition goes back to the medieval guilds. Here, the fivemembers of the cosmetology board are all owners of othersalons. &quot;There's a conflict of interest,&quot; Mr. Uqdah says.&quot;These salon owners on the board don't understand what we dohere, but they know we're a threat.&quot; He noted the irony ofoccupational licensing laws, used against blacks during JimCrow, now being used by a primarily black board against asalon specializing in African hair styles.   There's good evidence that barring entry was the purposeof Washington's cosmetology board. The Congressional Recordof 1938 quotes an owner of a small salon who opposed theboard as &quot;sponsored by the owners of the remaining number ofexclusive and high-priced beauty shops&quot; who &quot;hope to limit orcontrol competition.&quot;   A report by the District of Columbia bar association in1985 said the city's &quot;cosmetologists are grosslyoverregulated,&quot; with rules that create &quot;a significant barrierto entry into the profession.&quot; The study noted that rulesrequire certain equipment for schools with fewer than 25students (&quot;four shampoo bowls, 10 stoves, six dryers, threeblowers&quot;), while larger, more established schools have nosuch requirements.   All this may make the case against Mr. Uqdah seem absurd,but the law makes these due-process or equal-protection caseshard to win if &quot;only&quot; an economic right is at stake. In legaljargon, judges now decree that economic rights are not&quot;fundamental&quot; and that economic regulations need only have a&quot;rational relationship&quot; to a legitimate goal. Still, there'snothing legitimate about barring competition.   Mr. Bolick, who works at the Institute for Justice inWashington, already has one victory against anti-competitivelicensing laws. In 1989 he represented Ego Brown, who startedseveral upscale shoeshine stands in Washington only to betold that a 1905 regulation in the city barred outdoorstands. Federal Judge John Pratt said this violated the EqualProtection Clause because other vendors weren't similarlylimited. &quot;A court would be shrinking from its most basic dutyif it abstained from both an analysis of the legislation'sarticulated objective and the method that the legislatureemployed to achieve that objective,&quot; Judge Pratt wrote. JudgeSporkin might find that the cosmetology board has more to dowith blocking competitors than with protecting consumers.   Mr. Uqdah could get support from higher courts. Mr. Bolickwrote a book in 1987 setting out a litigation strategy foreconomic civil rights, &quot;Changing Course.&quot; He got a letter ofpraise from Justice Thomas, then chairman of the EqualEmployment Opportunity Commission where Mr. Bolick hadworked. Justice Thomas wrote that the book &quot;makes thephilosophical connection between civil rights and the naturallaw.&quot; He added,   &quot;Equally important, but more significant because of itsrarity, is the compelling relationship . . . between `civilrights' and economic liberty.&quot;   Justice Thomas also had some interesting comments duringhis confirmation hearing about the suspect history ofoccupational licenses. &quot;Laws that did not allow mygrandfather to enjoy the fruits of his labor,&quot; Justice Thomassaid, were so powerful and so arbitrary that he &quot;literallyhad to get a drink before he went to the licensing bureau inSavannah to get the license he needed to drive his oiltruck.&quot; Some things haven't changed.</TEXT></DOC>
