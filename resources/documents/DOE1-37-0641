Distribution of IMP can be visualized in tomographicslices by single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). For betterevaluation and comparison in follow-up studies, right/left ratios werecomputed and an asymmetry index calculated. The most sensitive asymmetryindex was achieved by 120 average circumferential profiles. In 52 patientswith stroke and 16 controls the respective sensitivities of IMP-SPECT,computed tomography (CT), static and dynamic brain scanning and angiographywere evaluated. In patients with TIA and PRIND the IMP-SPECT had thehighest sensitivity of all non-invasive methods. In patients with completedstroke, the sensitivity of IMP-SPECT was comparable with that of CT (90vs. 93%). There was a significant correlation between the IMP asymmetryindex and the clinical and social score (p andless; 0.001). The IMP asymmetryindex was significantly correlated to the size of the CT lesion (p andless;0.001). In most patients, the size of the IMP lesion was larger thanthat of CT. In a prospective study, 28 patients with completed strokewere examined. 14 patients underwent surgical treatment (6 endarterectomies,5 EIA, 3 combined operations), 14 patients had medical treatment only.Both groups were reexamined after 10 and 6.5 months, respectively. Inboth groups, neither the IMP asymmetry index nor the size of the CT lesionwere changed, but the clinical and social scores improved (p andless; 0.01).The outcome in both groups was the same. A positive effect of surgerycould not be demonstrated.</TEXT></DOC>
