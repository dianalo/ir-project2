Mechanics work atkeeping rusty Volkswagen Beetles running. Panes are missing fromwindows in government buildings. Just about everything needs a coatof paint.   This is Vientiane 13 years after Communist forces took it overduring the Indochina War. It is more like a sleepy village than anational capital.   In contrast to virtually every urban center in Asia, itspopulation has decreased, from nearly 200,000 at the war's end in1975 to 100,000 now.   Virtually no construction has taken place under the Communists,who are trying to cope with one of the most meager economies in theworld. The landlocked country's per capita income hovers around$160 a year.   Vientiane's tallest building is the seven-story Ministry ofCulture, built more than 15 years ago. It faces a water fountainthat has no water.   Only a few traffic lights are seen along the main streets, whichbefore 1975 bustled with Chinese merchants. Some of their shops arenow closed, their owners having joined the exodus of more than300,000 from a country with a population of less than 4 million.   This small population and relatively abundant agricultural landhave helped avoid the hunger and poverty found in some other Asiancountries.   In Vientiane, at least, there is evidence of the good life forsome.   At the sprawling, open-air marketplace, vendors display a widevariety of consumer goods, mostly from Thailand, which lies justacross the Mekong River boundary.   Prices for Thai jeans, toothpaste and other basic items are onlyslightly higher than across the river.   Although Laos is closely linked with Vietnam, another neighbor,and has attempted to establish close economic ties with it, a largequantity of Laotian imports and exports still pass through Thailand.   Thais and Laotians share racial and cultural bonds and despitethe Laotian government's its attempts to veer away from pro-WesternThailand, residents of Vientiane read Thai magazines, gossip aboutThai movie stars and tune in to Thai television.   There is also a lingering influence of the French, onetimecolonial masters in Laos. Apart from the French-style residences,one can still buy tasty French bread and frequent suchestablishments as La Fantaisie Tailor and hairdressing salons withFrench names.   Even a big billboard advertising the Soviet airline Aeroflot and``its more than 160 worldwide destinations,'' is written in French,although hundreds of Soviet advisers are in the country and someattempt is made to teach Russian in schools.   But Moscow and the Soviet way of life seem very distant fromlanguid Vientiane. Aeroflot's Flight SU553 flies directly fromMoscow to Vientiane once a week but it does not pick up passengerson its return.   Despite strident Marxist calls to greater efforts at nationalreconstruction, the old Laos of temple bells and the ``bo penyang'' (``never mind, take it easy'') lifestyle appears in somedegree to have survived.   Near the 16th century monastery of That Luang, barefoot boysplau around an ancient frangipani tree in bloom as their motherspass the day chatting.   Evidently intact is the traditional hospitality of Laotians.   Although Western journalists are rarely granted visas, onceadmitted they are invariably greeted with the smiles, patience andsmall kindnesses.   By far the largest group of journalists to visit Laos _ 55 Thaisand other foreigners _ were entertained with dances and a magicshow and fed exotic food as they accompanied Thailand's army chief,Gen. Chaovalit Yongchaiyudh, to Vientiane for a 27-hour visitrecently. Chaovalit was leading a Thai military delegation tryingto patch up relations after the bloodiest border fighting betweenthe two countries since 1975.   At Vientiane's Laksi restaurant, overlooking the Mekong River,the visitors were served pangolin stew, a concoction of onions,wild mushrooms and dark meat of the toothless anteater.   The Laotians reportedly went out of their way to capture theanimal and prepare the delicacy for military officers they had beenfighting a week earlier.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Thurs PMs March 24</NOTE></DOC>
