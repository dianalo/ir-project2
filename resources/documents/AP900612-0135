Havel and Calfa are leaders of the two groups that led lastwinter's anti-Communist revolution and won last week's elections.   The official news agency CTK said Havel tapped Calfa after ameeting of the leaders of the two groups _ Havel's Civic Forum andCalfa's Public Against Violence _ agreed Calfa should form the newgovernment.   The two groups together won 46 percent of Parliament's 300 seatsin the elections, held Friday and Saturday. They need afive-eighths majority to push through constitutional reform.   Calfa's spokesman Ivan Fiala said he believed Calfa would beready to present the new government and its program to Parliamentwithin two weeks.   Parliament will then elect a new president, almost certainlyHavel, to serve for two years before new elections.   The leader of Slovakia's conservative Christian Democrats, whocame in third in the election after the Communists, told CTK in aninterview that his party will stay in the opposition.   ``The Christian Democratic Movement will not join a coalitionwith the Civic Forum and will have no participation in the futuregovernment,'' CTK quoted Jan Carnogursky as saying.   Carnogursky, a former leading dissident, indicated his ambitionswould be limited to his native Slovakia.   Calfa, a Slovak, was Havel's choice for the premiership. Sourcesinside Civic Forum and Public Against Violence made clear beforelast weekend's elections however that they were not happy with thechoice of a former Communist.   Calfa, 44, became premier during the bargaining that led lastDecember to the formation of a ``government of nationalunderstanding'' dominated by Civic Forum.   The premier, a lawyer from Slovakia, turned in his Communistparty card in January and since then is said by Havel aides to haveimpressed the president with his political skills.   Calfa was a top candidate for Public Against Violence in theelections. Civic Forum and its ally won 46 percent of the vote, anda projected 169 of the 300 seats in the federal Parliament.   Key officials such as Foreign Minister Jiri Dienstbier andFinance Minister Vaclav Klaus are considered certain to keep theirjobs.   It is uncertain who will be interior minister, the government'stop law enforcement official. The incumbent, Richard Sacher, hascome under fire from Civic Forum for alleged reluctance toinvestigate the files of the now disbanded Communist secret police.   A top official of Sacher's People's Party, Josef Bartoncik, waspublicly accused by Havel's aides Saturday of having worked for thesecret police for the last 17 years.   The People's Party, one of three parties in the ChristianDemocratic coalition, denies the accusations.</TEXT></DOC>
