Notecontents.</NOTE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A former television preacher says he told a grandjury he had sex with Jim Bakker three times and arranged the fatefultryst with church secretary Jessica Hahn at Bakker's urging,according to a magazine interview.   John Wesley Fletcher, who appeared on ``The PTL Club'' televisionprogram from the mid-1970s to 1981, described Bakker as a bisexualwho openly lusted after the show's young male camera operators.   ``I was Jim Bakker's male prostitute,'' he said in the interviewfor January's Penthouse magazine.   Fletcher is the second man to say publicly that he had sex withBakker. In September, former PTL official Jay Babcock said he hadtold the grand jury of a sexual encounter with Bakker.   Fletcher said in the interview released Sunday that he relatedthe sexual encounters to the federal grand jury investigatingcharges that Bakker, Bakker's wife, Tammy, and PTL aide DavidTaggart illegally spent contributions to the ministry on theirlavish lifestyles.   The grand jury, meeting in Charlotte, N.C., apparently begandeliberations today after a 16-month investigation.   Among other things, witnesses have said the jury also isinvestigating whether ministry funds were used to pay $364,000 inhush money to Ms. Hahn or to entice aides to grant Bakker homosexualfavors. The jury has been examining allegations of wire, tax andmail fraud.   Federal prosecutors were in the panel's meeting room for nearlytwo hours this morning before returning to their offices and leavingthe grand jury alone.   Bakker, the PTL founder, has denied in a sworn deposition that heever had a homosexual relationship with anyone, and has deniedcharges of financial wrongdoing.   Two attorneys for Bakker, Jim Toms and Ryan Hovis, issued thisstatement Sunday in response to the Penthouse report:   ``Sadly, some so-called journalists continue to exploit humantragedy by stories such as the one we now understand to be inPenthouse about Mr. Fletcher.   ``He has lost his ministry and finances and recently has beenhospitalized. We would not want to further add to his difficultiesby commenting on the story, and simply point to where it is beingpublished.''   Toms has said he believes it is only a matter of time before thegrand jury indicts Bakker.   Fletcher said he participated in homosexual activity with Bakkeronly reluctantly.   Fletcher said he related allegations about Bakker's sexualencounters to officials of the Assemblies of God before thePentecostal denomination defrocked Bakker in May 1987.   Fletcher was removed from the Assemblies of God ministry in 1981amid accusations of homosexual activity, the magazine said.   Penthouse reported that Fletcher's psychiatrist confirmed hespent a month in a hospital last spring recovering from a suicideattempt.   Fletcher blamed himself in the interview for setting off PTL'ssex-and-hush money scandal by introducing Hahn to Bakker, eventhough he said he did so at Bakker's request. Hahn has charged thatBakker and Fletcher raped her in a Florida hotel room; Fletcher saidin the interview that she willingly had sex.   Fletcher also charged that Bakker often threatened suicide tomanipulate those around him and was cynical about fund-raising.   ``Some of the little old ladies he called `Grandma Grunts,' likehere comes another pocketbook,'' Fletcher said.</TEXT></DOC>
