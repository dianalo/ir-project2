The Department has nowcompleted the administrative review in accordance with section 751 of theTariff Act of 1930 (``the Tariff Act'').<ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of the Review</ITAG>Imports covered by the review are shipments of viscose rayon staple fiber,except solution dyed, in noncontinuous form, not carded, not combed andnot otherwise processed, wholly of filaments (except laminated filamentsand plexiform filaments), currently classifiable under items 309.4320 and309.4325 of the Tariff Schedules of the United States Annotated.

Wereceived comments from the petitioner and the respondent.<T3>Comment 1: </T3>Kemira Oy questions our comparison between home marketprice and U.S. price. Kemira objects to our inclusion of ``wet-laid nonwoven''fiber in our calculation of the weighted-average home market price sincethis fiber is processed in a different manner than other types of fiberthus resulting in higher manufacturing costs and selling costs.The petitioner objects to Kemira's suggestion to exclude this type of fiberfrom calculation of weighted-average home market price and agrees thatthe Department's decision to use a weighted-average of all different typesof fiber sold in the home market is correct.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>Based on information on the record as ofthe date of the preliminary determination, there is no indication thatthis type of fiber is not identical to the other fiber sold in the homemarket. Respondent's assertions that this type of fiber is processed differentlyresulting in different costs was made after the preliminary determinationand are untimely. Accordingly, this type is included for foreign marketvalue calculations.<T3>Comment 2: </T3>Kemira asks that the Department reconsider its creditcalculation based on further explanation of information contained in itsquestionnaire response.The petitioner maintains that since the Department's credit calculationwas based on information contained in Kemira's questionnaire response,Kemira should not be permitted to submit new or changed information atthis late stage in the review.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>The credit calculation made in the preliminaryresults of review was based on information contained in Kemira's responseto our questionnaire. Based on the same information contained in the questionnaireresponse, the Department has recalculated its credit calculation for thefinal results of review to take into account an oversight in our analysisin the preliminary determination pointed out by Kemira Oy.<ITAG tagnum="84">Final Results of Review</ITAG>Based on our analysis of the comments received, the final results are changedfrom those presented in the preliminary results of review, and we determinethat a margin of 1.41 percent exists for Kemira Oy Sateri for the periodMarch 1, 1986 through February 28, 1987.The Department will instruct the Customs Service to assess antidumpingduties on all appropriate entries. Individual differences between UnitedStates prices and foreign market value may vary from the percentage statedabove. The Department will issue appraisement instructions directly tothe Customs Service.Further, as provided for in section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act, a cashdeposit of estimated antidumping duties of 1.41 percent shall be required.This deposit requirement is effective for all shipments of Finnish viscoserayon staple fiber entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumptionon or after the date of publication of this notice and shall remain ineffect until publication of the final results of the next administrativereview.This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1)of the Tariff Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1) and andSection; 353.53a of the CommerceRegulations (19 CFR 353.53a).<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: February 7, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Gilbert B.
