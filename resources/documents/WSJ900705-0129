They might as well have focused on &quot;Buggy Whip Boulevard.&quot;Of several Cambridge AI companies widely publicized at thetime, at least three are out of business; the biggest hasshrunk to half its former size, and others have slashedemployment 50% to 90% in desperate attempts to becomeprofitable.</LP><TEXT>   Nationwide, the picture is much the same. The AI industry,which many market researchers had projected would reach $4billion in annual sales by now, remains nascent. Generousestimates of the market today are closer to $600 million.After swallowing up hundreds of millions of dollars inventure capital and exciting some of the brightest professorsat top technical schools with visions of riches, hundreds ofAI start-ups have yielded only a few profitable publiccompanies.   &quot;We're in AI winter,&quot; says Richard A. Shaffer, publisherof Technologic Computer Letter, a New York newsletter onventure capital and high technology.   These days, the surviving AI companies are trying toregroup. They are hiring outside managers, trumpeting themerits of cost-cutting now that venture funds are gone, andplaying up what their products do while playing down the AIlink.   &quot;We're not an AI company. We're not selling, `Get close toAI,'&quot; says J. Philip Cooper, a former McGraw-Hill Inc.executive who slashed employment to 45 from 110 after he washired to rescue Applied Expert Systems Inc., a Cambridgemaker of &quot;expert systems&quot; for financial planners.   Artificial intelligence is the art of making computersmimic ordinary human abilities. Broadly defined, it includescomputerized vision systems that help machines in factories&quot;see&quot; or let computers analyze aerial photographs; speechrecognition systems that someday may result in languagetranslators or electronic typewriters that can takedictation; and robotics systems that guard warehouses orcarry television cameras. The biggest AI market is for expertsystems: software programs that seek to mimic the reasoningand decision making of specialists in different fields basedon rules of thumb and their data bases of knowledge.   To be sure, AI techniques are showing up in many areas.American Express Co. says an expert system in itscredit-authorization department saves it millions of dollarsa year by reviewing cardholders' big purchases andauthorizing them in seconds or flagging them for employees toquery. An expert system called Ask Dan About Your Taxes hasbeen melded into Andrew Tobias's Tax Cut software program.   And hope springs eternal. With new management in place,this year &quot;will be a turnaround for a lot of thesecompanies,&quot; says Harvey Newquist, president of Relayer Group,a Scottsdale, Ariz., firm that follows the industry.   Some companies echo that optimism. Industry pioneer AICorp., a 15-year-old software company in Waltham, Mass., wentpublic last week at $9.50 a share, 68 times earnings for theyear ended March 31, a sign that the market may be warming toAI stocks again. Another AI software company, closely heldfive-year-old Neuron Data Corp., Palo Alto, Calif., which had$8 million in sales last year, projects revenue of $100million for 1995.   Predicting how high technology will work as business isnotoriously difficult. Few analysts would have picked AppleComputer Inc. and Compaq Computer Corp. out of the myriad PCcompanies 10 years ago. But the ebullient birth anddiscouraging collapse of the AI industry go far beyond thenorm.   In retrospect, many people say artificial intelligenceisn't really a market in itself, but rather a series oftechniques for products in many different markets. LawrenceWeber, a Cambridge marketing consultant, says: &quot;I waspromoting AI as an end-all. It turned out to be aningredient. None of us knew that at the time.&quot;   Among investors, the situation &quot;was mass delusion,&quot; saysPhilip A. Cooper, who raised tens of millions of dollars tostart a now-defunct expert system company called PalladianCorp. in Cambridge. Mr. Cooper, who now heads a venturecapital firm, says, &quot;In the 17th century, people said`tulips' and the world went nuts. AI was a more virulent casebecause it was more difficult to define.&quot;   AI companies ran into trouble for a variety of reasons.Many didn't have a good understanding of the potentialmarkets. Applied Expert Systems tried to sell a $50,000package to professional financial planners who werethreatened by a computer that was said to produce betterfinancial plans than they could. Now the company is marketingthe package to banks and insurance companies as a tool thatwill let employees produce financial plans quickly forcustomers.   Other products were too expensive. In the early 1980s,LISP Machine Inc., Xerox Corp. and Texas Instruments Inc. alldesigned workstations that ran on LISP, the language ofchoice for early AI work, and predicted big sales. Butcustomers balked at the cost, which ran as high as $100,000,and eventually figured out ways to make LISP run on existingworkstations and PCs. LISP Machine disappeared from publicview after filing for Chapter 11 protection from creditors;Xerox is out of the business, and Texas Instruments' AIeffort now emphasizes software and consulting.   Some companies had problems because executives came fromacademic backgrounds and gave short shrift to marketing. Mr.Cooper, who took over Applied Expert Systems, says oneimportant innovation was diverting some research money todevelop a training video and cue cards to teach customers howto use the company's products. John S. Wurts, who was broughtin from a successful software company to turn aroundSymbolics Inc., says he discovered that salespeople at theCambridge company didn't realize they had to sell to seniormanagement and data processing managers as well astechnicians within companies.   Many AI companies headed by well-funded academics spentmoney freely, says Mr. Newquist of Relayer Group. He saysmoney-losing companies threw lavish parties at AIconventions. Mr. Wurts says Symbolics, started by veterans ofMIT's AI laboratory, paid programmers $60,000 to $90,000 ayear, 30% more than they would get now. At its peak,Symbolics had 1,100 employees and planned to hire 600 more.Mr. Wurts consolidated in cheaper office space Symbolicsoperations that had been split up among three high-priced,elegantly furnished facilities in Cambridge, suburban Bostonand Los Angeles.   Russell Noftsker, Symbolics's founder and former chiefexecutive, says the company &quot;had a proprietary advancedtechnology. We could command the price margins that wouldallow us to support that structure.&quot; Symbolics could havebeen a player in the booming workstation market, he says, ifthe company's venture capitalists hadn't delayed funding fora low-priced microprocessor version. Instead, he says,pricing pressure from other companies &quot;brought our revenuedown faster than we could cut costs.&quot;   Growth turned to wrenching retrenchment. Symbolics'semployment has plunged by more than two-thirds to 350 people.Sales, which had soared to $114.2 million in 1986 from $1.8million in 1982, fell to $67.2 million in the year ended June30, 1989, when the company had a small profit. Revenue fell18% in the first nine months of fiscal 1990, and the companyexpects to post a loss for the year.   Several software companies likewise spent too much andoverestimated the market, and their stocks have performedpoorly. Intellicorp Inc., a Mountain View, Calif., maker ofAI tools used by programmers to write expert systems, wentpublic in 1983 and traded as high as $17, but closed recentlyat $6. After several erratic years, it expects to post itssecond straight year of profits, with sales topping $20million, analysts say. Teknowledge Inc., which went public in1986 at $13, was eventually acquired by a Pittsburgh companycalled Cimflex in a stock swap; the stock of CimflexTeknowledge Corp. is now under $1 a share.   Even at struggling companies, executives remain believersin the technology. But they fear that the industry's lack ofcommercial success will hurt interest. &quot;When the AI industrystarted going down, an awful lot of people said, `I guess AIisn't any good,'&quot; says Mr. Wurts of Symbolics. &quot;It'simportant for the future of the U.S. that people understandthis stuff is a real competitive weapon.&quot;   ---            Great Expectations Meet Hard Reality                                                                                                                     Mid-1980s projections of the 1990                Artificial intelligence market                                                                                                          ESTIMATE   (in billions)     SOURCE                     YEAR                                                                                                          $4 +              American Banker            1986   $4.2              L.F.
