In the new savings-and-loan bailout law, Congress directed the FDIC to charge the fees to prevent the bank-deposit insurance fund from being diluted when banks buy savings and loans and thus bring more deposits under FDIC protection. The FDIC is moving quickly because the fees must be set before the government can sell some of the 260 insolvent thrifts under its control to banks that want to convert them into banks. FDIC Chairman William Seidman said the FDIC hopes to institute the fees next week.    The fees would be set at 79 cents for every $100 of insured deposits in the acquired thrift, according to a staff memo accepted by the FDIC board as a basis for discussion. That corresponds to the current ratio -- 0.79% -- of the FDIC's bank insurance fund to the deposits the fund backs up.    Some observers had expected the fee to be higher -- about 1% or 1.5% of insured deposits -- because the bank-insurance fund has been relatively low after the wave of bank failures in recent years. &quot;It's lower than we expected it to be,&quot; said Barry Taff, a Washington attorney who handles banking acquisitions. He said regulators may have decided to set the fee fairly low to encourage banks to acquire insolvent thrifts.    In purchases of insolvent thrifts controlled by the Resolution Trust Corp., the fee would be based on so-called core deposits -- consumer deposits from regular customers of the thrifts. Because these insolvent thrifts often attracted large amounts of deposits by offering unusually high interest rates in an attempt to preserve their liquidity, the FDIC would base the fee only on deposits expected to remain with them when the buyer lowers interest rates. Also, in the case of thrifts acquired from the RTC, the fee payment could be spread out over five years. The RTC is the agency set up by the new law to merge or liquidate insolvent thrifts.    Under the bailout law, a bank also can buy a branch of a healthy thrift and convert it to a bank -- as long as the branch holds less than 35% of the thrift's overall deposits. In those acquisitions, the fees would be based on all insured deposits of the branch, not just the core deposits, and the payment would have to be made in one lump sum soon after the acquisition.    The bailout law also calls for &quot;exit&quot; fees to be paid into the Savings Association Insurance Fund when a thrift is converted to a bank and thus switches to the bank fund. Those fees are to be determined by the FDIC in conjunction with the Treasury Department. FDIC staff recommended that there be no exit fee in sales of thrifts under RTC control. </TEXT></DOC>
