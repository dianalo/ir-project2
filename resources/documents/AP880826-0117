Texas _ which commands 29 electoral votes, and 270 are needed towin the presidency _ has become a key battleground with theselection of Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas as the running mate ofBush's Democratic rival, Michael Dukakis.   Bush made no mention while campaigning Thursday of hisbeleaguered running mate, Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana, but hepredicted that he will win in his adopted home state in November.   Bush seemed eager to get on with his campaign after many days ofmedia focus on the background of Quayle. Asked by reporters if hethought the Quayle matter was behind him, Bush said, ``Yes, I do.''   However, a new report today in The (Cleveland) Plain Dealer saysQuayle's official Senate and campaign biography contains inflatedclaims about his service in the Indiana attorney general's office.The newspaper reported that Quayle was an entry-level researchassistant for most of the time he claims to have been ``chiefinvestigator for the Consumer Protection Division of the IndianaAttorney General's Office from 1970-1971.''   Bush focused Thursday on his pitch to Texas voters, and after awarm reception from several hundred supporters at a San Antoniorally, he said, ``There does seem to be forward motion.''   On his four-day swing through Texas, the vice president washeading today to Longview for a rally, and on Saturday will go toDallas for a speech to a Marine Corps group and a Republicanfund-raiser.   ``I will win in Texas but I will work hard to do that,'' Bushtold reporters as he left the rally en route to Houston.   The campaign stop in San Antonio was tailored to appeal to theregion's large Hispanic population.   Wearing a loose-fitting shirt called a guayaberra for theoccasion, he was welcomed at the downtown San Antonio River frontby a banner in Spanish and he was serenaded by a Mariachi versionof ``Hail to the Chief.'' In his remarks to the sweltering outdoorrally, Bush promised ``to help those minorities who haven't reallyhad a shot at the starting line.''   ``The best way to do that in employment is to have urban andrural enterprise zones, a break in that tax structure that willencourage business to locate where those populations are,'' Bushsaid.   ``I support affirmative action so minorities have a better shotat the American dream,'' he said. ``I will be a good president forall Americans.''   At the rally, Bush promised he would ``put some incentive backinto the energy business, into the oil business,'' and said hewould resist gun control proposals.   In an interview published today by the New York Times, Bushappeared to back away from earlier promises to deploy the Star Warsmissile defense system ``as soon as feasible.'' He indicated thatcost would be a factor in determining whether to deploy it.   ``I don't think we yet know what the price tag will be,'' Bushsaid. ``If you went to a full deployment of a full strategicdefense, it would be very expensive. What I want to do is tocontinue research at the levels of funding, essentially, that wehave requested.''   Sheila Tate, Bush's press secretary, said the vice president wasnot shifting his stance on Star Wars and has always supportedresearch on the defense system.   She said Bush has long contended that ``full deployment would bevery, very expensive, that we would cross that bridge when we cometo it.''   In Texas, Bush recalled his move to the state in the 1940s, withhis wife Barbara, to begin working in the oil industry.   ``I was drawn to this state by two things _ Texas was a place ofbig opportunity, a can do place, and it was strong in thetraditional values, family, faith and peace and patriotism,'' hesaid. ``I'm proud to be back in my home state of Texas.''   The vice president maintains a formal address at the Houstonianhotel and condominium complex in Houston where he is staying duringhis campaign trip.   ``We are getting to be a high-tech state,'' he said, adding thathe would help stimulate new business by cutting the capital gainstax and keeping Congress ``from strangling small business withregulation.''</TEXT></DOC>
