That's the advice from financial professionals, who say the risks now are just too great for CD investors to suddenly jump into stocks. Instead, these advisers say, CD holders should put most of their rollover money into low-risk investments.    CDs and Treasury bills are the favored investments for people who may need their money within six months to a year and those who depend on reliable interest payments, the advisers say. While yields on money-market mutual funds are still quite attractive, those yields will decline in the months ahead if interest rates tumble.    For people who want higher returns than they can get on CDs, and who can live with a little more risk and uncertainty, the advisers' investments of choice are intermediate-term bond funds, intermediate-term Treasury securities and so-called asset-allocation mutual funds, which shift investors' money among stocks, bonds and cash.    The stock market may be fine for some portion of the CD rollover money, several financial advisers say, but only if an investor is willing to take some chances. Even then, the advisers urge investors to be conservative. &quot;I'd stick to blue chips and do it through mutual funds,&quot; says Donald Sherman, a Walnut Creek, Calif., financial planner.    Hank Madden, a planner with IDS Financial Services in Jacksonville, Fla., suggests that investors who want to buy stocks buy a high-grade municipal bond fund and use the income from that fund to buy shares in an equity mutual fund. It's generally considered prudent for investors to have some of their money in stocks as part of a balanced portfolio. And the stock market could be especially tempting for CD investors who've missed out on the handsome returns over the past year. While people who put their money in CDs a year ago have had to be content with an average return of about 8%, those who went into stocks have enjoyed a total return of more than 30%.    But for investors who've been out of the market, the advisers say the current risks are just too great to start putting substantial funds into it now.    &quot;For the market to rise 25% to 30% a year is very unusual and we've already achieved that in the first eight months,&quot; says Mr. Madden. &quot;There's no reason not to expect a correction.&quot;    Investors who do put some of their rollover money into stocks or stock mutual funds should be prepared to think long term. &quot;Unless someone has dollars they can really kiss goodbye for a few years, I tell them to stay away from the market,&quot; says Timothy Chase, a financial planner with the firm of Walpert, Smullian andamp; Blumenthal in Baltimore.    Because of the stock market's ups and downs, an investor who suddenly needs money could be forced to sell at a loss. &quot;The chances of losing money in the stock market in a year are about 30%,&quot; says Ken Gregory, a San Francisco investment manager. &quot;Over five years the risk drops dramatically, and over 10 years it's practically nil.&quot;    If CD investors want to stick with the safety of insured CDs, they &quot;have to become accustomed to the fact that this is a lower rate environment,&quot; says Mr. Gregory.    CD yields have dropped substantially since April, when many of the CDs coming due next month were purchased. Major banks are currently offering an average of 8% on a six-month CD of less than $55,000, according to Banxquote Money Markets, a New York information service. That's down from 9.10% in late April.    Yields on money-market mutual funds, which aren't federally insured but are considered relatively risk-free, liquid investments, also have fallen. According to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a newsletter based in Holliston, Mass., the latest average seven-day compound yield on taxable money funds was 8.61%, compared with 9.62% in April.    Treasury bills are down, too, with the six-month T-bill sold at Monday's auction yielding 8.06%. It was 9.25% on April 24.    These lower yields may not be as bad as they look, however. On a $20,000 investment, for example, a full percentage point decline means a difference of just $200 a year. And Treasury bills are also exempt from state taxes, which at current rates would boost the yield on a six-month T-bill to the equivalent of 8.71% for someone paying 7.5% in state taxes.    Still, there are ways to increase returns without greatly increasing risk.    Edward D. McCarthy, a Providence, R.I., financial planner, says &quot;hybrid&quot; mutual funds that invest in both money-market securities and bonds &quot;may provide a fairly stable investment with higher yields.&quot; Kurt Brouwer, a San Francisco investment adviser, prefers bonds that mature in two to five years or bond funds. The price fluctuations are moderate, he says, and &quot;you know you can hold out that long.&quot;    Long-term bonds probably aren't for the typical CD investor, several advisers say. &quot;The kind of person who's been in a bank can't stand the heat of long-term bonds,&quot; Mr. Brouwer says. If interest rates rise just 1%, the value of a 30-year bond drops 8% to 10%, he notes.    Mr. Madden, the IDS financial planner in Jacksonville, suggests that people who are determined to put some of their CD rollover money in stocks buy a high-grade municipal-bond fund and use the income from that fund to buy shares in an equity mutual fund.    ---   Jill Bettner contributed to this article.
