Carroll   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>03/19/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A10</SO><CO>   IBM</CO><IN>COMPUTERS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (CPR)</IN><LP>   International Business Machines Corp.'s proxy statementshows that its five senior executives each got raises lastyear of 33% or more, at least twice the increase in thecompany's earnings.   Separately, the computer giant scheduled a conference callwith securities analysts before the stock market opens thismorning, and analysts said they are nervous that IBM may besignaling a profit decline for the first quarter. The lasttime IBM scheduled such a call, it told analysts that thethird quarter of 1989 was a disaster, and analysts said IBMhas been indicating that demand has been weak in Europe.</LP><TEXT>   The analysts cautioned that IBM could also be announcingthat it has completed the sale of its Lexington, Ky.,operations, which would produce a special gain. IBM has saidit expects to complete the sale this month and has indicatedit might announce an early retirement program that wouldproduce a charge offsetting the gain. Analysts would view anyfurther job cuts as bolstering IBM's prospects. An IBMspokesman in Armonk, N.Y., declined to comment.   IBM's stock, which has been strong in recent weeks, closedyesterday at $127.875 a share, up $1.25, in New York StockExchange composite trading of 1.5 million shares.   In the proxy statement, IBM disclosed that its chairman,John F. Akers, was paid $2.6 million in cash and restrictedstock units in 1990, a 35% increase from 1989. Jack Kuehler,president, received a 36% raise to $1.6 million. Frank Metz,a senior vice president, got a 43% raise to $1.2 million. C.Michael Armstrong and Terry Lautenbach, also senior vicepresidents, received raises of 33%, to $1.2 million.   And those raises don't tell the whole story. Mr. Akersalso received a so-called restricted stock award of 15,900IBM shares; he received no such award in 1989. Those sharesare currently valued at about $2 million. Likewise, Mr.Kuehler received about $1.1 million in IBM stock, Mr. Metz$825,000 and Messrs. Armstrong and Lautenbach $725,000. They,too, didn't get restricted stock awards in 1989.   An IBM spokesman defended the raises by saying that muchof senior executives' pay depends on the company'sperformance. Mr. Akers has said he would increasingly tie payto performance as a way of getting the attention of hissenior executives.   The spokesman said 1990 was a good year and 1989 wasn't.Per-share earnings rose 16% in 1990 after falling 8% in 1989,if a pretax restructuring charge in 1989 is removed from thecalculations.   He said the restricted stock awards shouldn't be lumpedinto 1990's pay because they don't reflect performance justfor a single year and are made only periodically.   The proxy also disclosed that former IBM Chairman Frank T.Cary, 70 years old, won't stand for re-election as a directorat the IBM annual meeting, marking the end of an era. Mr.Cary is probably the third most influential figure in IBM'shistory, behind only the Watsons, father and son, who ran thecompany from its inception through the early 1970s. Mr. Cary,who has been on the board for 23 years, ran the companythrough the early 1980s and, after picking Mr. Akers as chiefexecutive, has continued to be the dominant presence on theboard apart from Mr. Akers.   Separately, a group of former IBM employees sued thecompany in Lexington, Ky., saying they were misled intoaccepting an early retirement offer. The employees said IBMassured them in late 1989 and early 1990 that no better offerwould be forthcoming, even though it must have already beenconsidering the higher offer it made when it agreed to sellthe Lexington operations last summer. The later offer wasnearly twice as good as the one they accepted.   The suit was filed as a class action on behalf of 500employees, so the amount of damages is likely to be small byIBM standards even if the plaintiffs win the punitive damagesthey seek. Still, the suit does threaten to tarnish IBM'sreputation as a good employer.   There have already been numerous complaints from IBMemployees about having to stay with the Lexington operationseven though they are being acquired in a leveraged buy-out bythe investment firm of Clayton andamp; Dubilier. Employees havecomplained that even if they quit they wouldn't be allowed toreturn to IBM for years. Some have said they only intended tostay in Lexington briefly to get experience in amanufacturing operation.   Sensitive to the issues raised in the suit, IBM said in astatement: &quot;We are concerned that some former IBM employeesbelieve they have been mistreated. . . . IBM is proud of itstradition of respect for the individual and fairness in allemployee matters.&quot; A spokesman declined to comment further.</TEXT></DOC>
