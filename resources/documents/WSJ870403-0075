A doctor advised the U.S. minister plenipotentiary in Paris to go to Aix-en-Provence for a cure. He got in his carriage on Feb. 28, 1787, visited not only Aix but also the north coast of Italy, came back up the western side through the vineyards of Bordeaux, and visited the chateaux along the Loire before returning to Paris.    Historians have ever since scoured Jefferson's letters and diaries, looking for hidden motives for his trip, by far the longest one he took outside Paris during his five-year stay. Some say he was fleeing an unhappy love affair. Others theorize that he was engaged in industrial espionage, trying to get a close look at productive Italian rice fields. Still others think he was taking the temperature of the countryside in pre-revolution France, as a sideline to his main job of soliciting funds for the young United States.    But the Burgundians know what he was doing: drinking their wine. And they've figured out how to make the most of his brief stop.    &quot;Jefferson was probably the first American tourist in Burgundy, he knew his wine, and he liked ours,&quot; says Jean-Francois Bazin, first vice president of the Burgundy regional council. &quot;He took cuttings of our vines to plant in Virginia, and he had 100 cases of Chambertin {a Burgundy} shipped to the White House in 1803.&quot;    Never mind that the future president spent only nine days out of a 3 1/2-month trip in Burgundy, and likely couldn't have gone through the region any faster. Or that he almost certainly liked Bordeaux wines better and bought a lot of them through the U.S. consul-general in Bordeaux.    Never mind, either, that it was a bottle of 1784 Chateau d'Yquem, a Bordeaux, not a Burgundy, that Jefferson presciently initialed and that was auctioned for $156,000 last year. Ignore a Jefferson letter from one of his first stops on the tour: &quot;The plains of Yonne are in corn, the hills in vineyard, but the wine not good.&quot;    None of this matters to the Burgundy tourism people, because they thought of celebrating the bicentennial of Jefferson's visit before anybody else did.    The Jefferson connection isn't the only ploy Burgundy has thought up in its centuries-old battle with Bordeaux and other wine regions. During the Great Depression, in 1934, when nobody was buying their wine, the Burgundian vintners decided they might as well drink it themselves. They formed the Confrerie des Chevaliers du Tastevin, a club that hosts dinners where an enormous amount of Burgundy is consumed. Branches have sprouted around the world, notably in the U.S.    The Confrerie's 660th &quot;chapitre&quot;, or dinner, honors Mr. Jefferson and Franco-American friendship. It is held, as usual, in the former monastery of Chateau du Clos de Vougeot, which is surrounded by some of the best vineyards in the area. Speaker after speaker extols both Mr. Jefferson and more recent American arrivals, such as Eastman Kodak Co. and Hoover Co., which have brought 6,000 jobs to the region, and American wine-lovers, who buy a third of the area's production each year.    The dinner progresses, and as the Aligote 1985 is followed by the Meursault 1982 is followed by the Pernand-Vergelesses 1983, Thomas Jefferson gets closer and closer to having been a real Burgundy fan. &quot;Jefferson practically stopped here,&quot; at the chateau, says an early speaker. After a few more toasts, a later speaker avers that Jefferson &quot;did stop here and even shook the hand of the head monk.&quot; By the time the last glass of Musigny 1972 is drained, and the dozen musicians dressed as wine-growers have finished their medley of &quot;Yellow Rose of Texas,&quot; &quot;New York, New York&quot; and &quot;America the Beautiful,&quot; Jefferson could well have spent a couple of weeks in the chateau for all any of the guests could tell.    &quot;It was very nice of Burgundy to invite us all,&quot; says Frank Shuffleton, a history professor at the University of Rochester. &quot;But I think Jefferson really preferred Bordeaux.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
