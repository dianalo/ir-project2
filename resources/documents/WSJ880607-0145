(AP)  </DATELINE><TEXT>   When International Business Machines Corp. suddenly closed its operations here a year and a half ago and took away nearly 1,000 jobs, it left behind a lot of &quot;ducks.&quot;    &quot;Very calm on the surface, but paddling furiously underneath,&quot; says local merchant Barbara Lane.    But through careful planning, good fortune and hard work, this quiet college town has attracted six new employers and 1,000 replacement jobs in the short term, and as many as 2,000 five years from now.    Long before Armonk, N.Y.-based IBM said it would close its parts-distribution center after 33 years, Greencastle had laid the foundation to deal with the shock of losing 8% of the jobs in Putnam County.    IBM made the announcement without warning in November 1986. By the following March, about half the employees had transferred to other sites. The rest had taken early retirement.    &quot;The fact that IBM closed could have been devastating. It wasn't,&quot; says banker Bill Marley. &quot;The framework was there, we were ready to go.&quot;    In 1983, an economic development review identified the strengths and weaknesses of the town of 8,400. It pointed out the importance of revitalizing the courthouse square, which had just been designated a national historic district. A needed hotel also was planned for the edge of the DePauw University campus.    Two years later a planning group examined the town's economic future, leading to the incorporation of the Greencastle Development Center in September 1986.    Despite an initial dark mood in town, residents projected only optimism to reporters who came to record the changes Greencastle was going through. &quot;Every time any media came around, the word would get around and the cheerleading would begin. I think that's what won all the industry,&quot; says Ms. Lane, who heads the group that has led the rehabilitation of buildings along the courthouse square.    No one has a harsh word for IBM. It gave $1.7 million to local government to smooth the transition of its loss and continued its United Way contribution of more than $120,000 for three years. It also turned over $700,000 from the sale of &quot;Big Blue,&quot; its 350,000-square-foot complex.    Just as important, IBM bought the more than 300 homes being sold by transferred employees and hired Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. to market them. Fewer than 10 remain unsold.    Fortunate timing helped Greencastle. Just days before IBM's announcement, bonds were sold for a $13 million expansion of the high school and construction of the middle school. A week later and the bonds might not have been sold. The bonds have made the schools more attractive to companies scouting new locations.    A day before the announcement, scouts for Automotive Industries Inc., which produces auto trim, had been in the area discussing possible locations. A few days later, they were inspecting the IBM site.    That January, 72 days after IBM's announcement, Automotive Industries became the first new industry to come to Greencastle in 15 years. It built a plant under the Shenandoah Industries name, which might employ as many as 700 workers in five years.    &quot;It was the boost we needed. It was a confirmation to our optimism,&quot; says Joyce Hanlon, president of the Greencastle Merchants Association.    Banker Dan Doan recalled the time he and others were in his office after midnight negotiating with an officer from Charming Shoppes Inc. in Pennsylvania on one phone and one from Shigeru K.K. in Japan on another. The result: Charming will move into &quot;Big Blue&quot; and employ 300 by early next year in a warehouse for its women's fashion outlets. More than 600 eventually might work there.    In addition, Shigeru, which will supply auto trim to Japanese auto plants being built in the Midwest, will employ 100 in a company called Heartland Automotive Inc. by the end of next year.    Three other companies -- two automobile-parts suppliers and Sherwin-Williams Co., which is setting up a distributing center for automotive paint -- also are developing facilities in an industrial park where once only IBM stood.    The new companies, however, won't replace IBM's payroll, which was $38 million. Bill Andis, IBM's former head of strategic planning who took early retirement to run the development center, says new employers will create an initial payroll of about $20 million.    Mayor Mike Harmless, a 38-year-old Greencastle native, says the new employers will create entry-level jobs for local high-school graduates. But until all the companies get going, &quot;these are going to be lean years for the community.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
