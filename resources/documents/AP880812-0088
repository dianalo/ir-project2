Chief presidential spokesman Lee Soo-jung said senior officialsfrom both countries have been discussing the matter since PresidentRoh Tae-woo took office in February.   Roh personally raised the issue when he met with DefenseSecretary Frank Carlucci and Secretary of State George Shultz inSeoul in June and July, Lee said.   ``The U.S. side agreed to consider the matter affirmatively, andthere have been a series of high and working-level talks betweenthe two countries,'' he said.   A government source here, speaking on condition of anonymity,said U.S. Ambassador James Lilley and Gen. Louis C. Menetrey,commander of the U.S. Forces in South Korea, have been discussingthe matter with South Korean Foreign Minister Choi Kwang-soo andDefense Minister Oh Ja-bok.   The source said military facilities in the U.S. compound wouldbe relocated under long- and short-term programs, depending on thesensitivity of military facilities involved.   He said some facilities used for non-military purposes, such asa golf course and a ball park, would be taken over by South Korea``as soon as possible'' and converted into a public park.   Although the two countries have no disagreement over the issue,they still need to discuss details including moving costs that mayrun into billions of dollars, a Foreign Ministry official said oncondition of anonymity.   Many South Koreans have been demanding a relocation of themilitary facilities, saing their location in the center of the cityblocks development.   Anti-U.S. sentiment is high in South Korea among radical collegestudents who hold the United States resonsible for the partition ofthe Korean Peninsula at the end of World War II in 1945. Theydemand the withdrawal of all U.S. troops in South Korea.   About 42,000 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea under amutual defense treaty signed in 1954. Their commanding headquartersare in the center of Seoul.   The military compound in Seoul, occupying 699 acres of land, isthe home of the headquarters of U.S. Forces, the 8th U.S. Army, theCombined ROK (Republic of Korea)-U.S. Forces Command and the U.S.Naval Headquarters in South Korea.   Also inside the compound are housing for some U.S. diplomats andmilitary personnel, an army radio and television station andmilitary schools and commissaries.   The number of military and civilian personnel living in thecompound is estimated at 6,000, according to U.S. militaryofficials here.   South Korean correspondents based in Washington said the U.S.government accepted the relocation on condition that South Koreatake up all costs. But South Korean officials maintain that theUnited States should also bear a responsible portion of the cost,the reports said.</TEXT></DOC>
