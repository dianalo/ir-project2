The Radiological Baseline Program (RBP) suppliespre-operational radiological data for the WIPP site. A subset of theRadiological Baseline is the Hydrologic Radiological Baseline Program(HRBP), which provides data from surface and ground water systems inthe vicinity of the WIPP site. Baseline data from one sweep of groundwater and two sweeps of surface water sites in the vicinity of WIPP ispresented. The ten surface water sites include: the only through-goingriver, several engineered catchments, and two lakes covering an extensivearea in the vicinity of the WIPP site. The ground water program, partof the Water Quality Sampling Program, consists of sampling twenty wellsfrom four water-bearing units at the WIPP site. One water-bearing zone,the Culebra Dolomite Member of the Rustler Formation, has been the subjectof the most extensive sampling and analyses efforts as it is consideredthe most feasible transport conduit in the event of a breach of the repository.Data reported to date indicates low levels of uranium, radium and radonare present in the ground water. This report represents the first ofseveral sampling suites for the pre-operational baseline characterizationat the WIPP site.</TEXT></DOC>
