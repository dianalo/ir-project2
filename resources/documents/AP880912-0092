The Democratic nominee began a three-day campaign trip focusingon national security, defense and foreign affairs _ three areas inwhich he has vulnerable to attack by his Republican rival.   His aides said Dukakis planned to deal with U.S.-Sovietrelations in Chicago on Tuesday and with military policy inWashington on Wednesday.   In a speech today at a union hall in Philadelphia, theMassachusetts governor said his three key points would be a strongdomestic economy that would bolster the U.S. position in worldtrade, unwavering opposition to terrorism and an expanded effort tohalt international drug trafficking.   ``In each of these three areas, George Bush has failed,''Dukakis said in prepared remarks. ``I want to beat our foreigncompetitors; he's willing to settle for second best. I want tocrack down on terrorism; he knuckled under to the Ayatollah. I wanta real war on drugs; his answer to drug kingpins like Noriega is J.Danforth Quayle.''   Dukakis criticized Bush's role in a long list of Reaganadministration policies, ranging from the Iran-Contra affair tocutbacks in federal funds for state and local drug programs andsupport for Gen. Manuel Noriega, the Panamanian leader who is underU.S. indictment for alleged drug trafficking.   ``Why haven't you explained to the American people, to ourparents and children, to our law enforcement officers and tovictims of drug-related crimes, why the United States governmenthad General Noriega on its payroll?'' Dukakis asked.   ``What kind of judgment is this?'' Dukakis asked. ``What kind ofpriorities are these? What kind of strategy for restoring respectfor America and protecting our national security can we expect fromMr. Bush. My friends, we need answers, and we need betterleadership from the next president than we are going to get fromGeorge Bush.''   He accused the Reagan administration of ``yielding control ofAmerica's economic future to bankers in Tokyo and Bonn.'' Hepromised to enforce the new trade law, encourage betterlabor-management relations and help business invest in newtechnology and research.   ``The primary foreign policy objective of the Dukakisadministration can be stated very simply: to restore respect forAmerican leadership in a changing world,'' Dukakis said.   He promised a strong military, a growing economy and ``strongand decisive leadership that understands and knows how to cope withchange.''   From Philadelphia, Dukakis was heading to Ohio to visit aGeneral Electric plant in Cincinnati which builds jet engines forthe Stealth bomber, which Dukakis supports.   The three states on the governor's current campaign swingaccount for 72 electoral college votes, or more than a quarter ofthe 270 votes needed to elect the next president.   During the weekend, Dukakis met with Democratic congressionalexperts on defense matters to prepare for his trip. After theirSunday meeting, they criticized President Reagan for vetoing adefense spending bill that won broad, bipartisan support inCongress and had the backing of several administration officials.   ``What you see here is an example of the way we're going to makenational security policy beginning in January 1989,'' Dukakis said.``With a president and a Congress that work together.''   Dukakis and the congressmen accused Reagan of vetoing the billto give GOP nominee George Bush fodder for his attempts tocharacterize Dukakis as naive on defense issues.   ``The vice president's political team said let's play politicalfootball with the nation's defense,'' said former presidentialcandidate Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee. ``I think it'soutrageous.''   Among those at Dukakis' side were Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia andRep. Les Aspin of Wisconsin, chairmen of the Senate and House ArmedServices Committees, respectively.   Nunn, Aspin and several others at the meeting agreed that Bushhas been successful in painting Dukakis as weak on defense but saidthey expected the Democratic nominee to counter those effortssuccessfully this week.</TEXT></DOC>
