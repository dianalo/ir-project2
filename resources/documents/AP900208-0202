Fire that began Saturday has destroyed more than half of thePoco das Antas Wildlife Reserve 80 miles northeast of Rio, saidVicente Moreira Conti, a spokesman for Ibama, Brazil'senvironmental protection agency.   More than 400 firefighters, police and biologists struggled toput out the blaze and save the animals.   Conti said the fire was burning in five areas of the 12,300-acrereserve, the last remaining stronghold for the marmoset and asanctuary for rare sloths, alligators, monkeys and jaguars.   ``The fire has severely burned areas where tamarin families wereliving. We fear some have died,'' Conti said in a phone interview.   Tamarin is another name for the marmoset, a monkey the size of acat with a lion-like mane and a bushy tail.   Conti said droves of animals were fleeing the area but onlysmall numbers of the marmosets had left the reserve. Biologistswere losing contact with the marmosets, monitored by means of tinyradio transmitters tied around their necks, he said.   Environmentalists are concerned the fire may kill all of theshy, little beasts because they hide in tree holes for warmth andshelter.   Conti said firefighters were clearing quarter-mile strips offorest to slow the spread of the fire.   But the firefighters were hampered by the 100-degreetemperatures of the Southern Hemisphere summer, high wind,difficult access to the mountainous area and a lack of water causedby a long dry spell, he said.   A twin-engined Dromader plane was to arrive on Friday fromsouthern Brazil to drop 21,000 gallons of water on critical areas,the equivalent of a month's rainfall in the region, he said.   Conti added, ``It's our last hope. We're trying to soak the soiland foilage to halt the spread of the fire.''   But he said it would take several days of heavy rain toextinguish the fire, and no rain was forecast before next week.   Manchete TV showed helicopters airlifting firefighters toburning areas and crews battling flames with portable water tanksand rubber mats.   Ibama president Fernando Mesquita promised more firefighters andsaid environmental specialists from northeastern Brazil will arriveFriday to help.   The cause of the fire was not known. But officials saidunusually dry weather and summer heat could have caused the fire tobegin spontaneously.   Poco das Antas, which in Portuguese means ``watering hole of thetapirs,'' had become the center of an international crusade toprotect the environment.   The reserve was founded in 1974 and funded by the SmithsonianInstitution in Washington, the World Wildlife Fund and theBrazilian and Canadian governments.   The Smithsonian said in Washington that two of its employees inthe reserve suffered minor injuries fighting the fire, and thatActing Associate Director Ben Beck will leave Sunday to assess thedamage.   The marmoset was pushed to edge of extinction in 1972 when just70 remained on Earth after poachers, hunters and ranchers trappedthem and cut down their forest habitats.   But the animal slowly had been reproducing after naturalistsreleased them in groups from foreign zoos into the Brazilian forest.</TEXT></DOC>
