Mr. Parnes was arrested in Los Angeles last week on charges of &quot;false accounting&quot; involving #3.4 million ($5.5 million), according to the London Metropolitan Police, or Scotland Yard. Mr. Parnes is being held in a federal prison in Los Angeles until a bail hearing Oct. 13, according to the U.S. Marshal's office there. An extradition hearing date will be set after the bail hearing.    Mr. Parnes, an independent stockbroker formerly associated with the London securities firm Alexanders Laing andamp; Cruikshank, is the second person to face charges arising from government investigations into Guinness's #2.53 billion takeover of Distillers Co. last year. Former Guinness Chairman Ernest Saunders was charged in May with attempting to pervert the course of justice.    The stockbroker was arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation as he, his wife and three children stepped off a flight from Paris, Scotland Yard said. The arrest was made at the request of the Scotland Yard's &quot;fraud squad.&quot;    In January, Mr. Parnes said he had received a payment of about #3 million from Guinness for undisclosed &quot;advisory services&quot; during the Distillers bid. He said at the time that he had testified to government investigators about his role during the bid.    Alexanders Laing andamp; Cruikshank, which severed ties with Mr. Parnes at the time of these disclosures, said then that Mr. Parnes had acted as an intermediary between Guinness officials and Heron International PLC, one of the concerns that received secret payments in return for buying Guinness shares during the bid.    The bid for Distillers consisted largely of Guinness shares, and the government is investigating the possibility of an illegal effort to prop the price of those shares in order to increase the value of the bid.    ---   Guiness Won't Move Base   LONDON -- Guinness PLC said it won't move its headquarters to Scotland, breaking a promise made at the time of its hotly contested takeover of Distillers Co. last year.    The London-based drinks company said changed circumstances forced it to renege on its pledge, made in a document sent to Distillers holders seeking their support for a takeover. Guinness said the challenge facing the company -- reviving world-wide consumption of its whiskey and other spirits -- requires it to keep its main office in London, a communications and transport center.    Guinness said it would set up a new subsidiary headquarters in Edinburgh to oversee its spirits business, and United Kingdom distribution is to be run by a unit based in the Scottish city of Perth. In addition, some corporate functions, including share registration, are to be transferred to Edinburgh. </TEXT></DOC>
