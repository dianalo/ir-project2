The 64-year-old Mr. Baldrige, who died Saturday from injuries suffered while practicing for a rodeo exhibition at a friend's ranch in Brentwood, Calif., had a major role in moderating the administration's free-trade stance and in easing its earlier policy of denying the Soviet bloc a wide range of high-technology products.    Mr. Baldrige, who brought his seniority as a member of President Reagan's cabinet and what Mr. Reagan called his &quot;common-sense wisdom&quot; to bear on trade issues, won't be easy to replace. There aren't many corporate executives and outsiders of his stature willing to serve for only the administration's remaining year and a half. There are even fewer who could enjoy Mr. Reagan's confidence as Mr. Baldrige did.    The White House, stunned by Mr. Baldrige's unexpected death, hasn't developed a list of possible successors. &quot;The issue will be addressed this week,&quot; a White House spokeswoman said.    Since the secretary's remaining agenda may call for a trusted insider who also has trade-policy experience, Mr. Reagan may consider the option of naming Labor Secretary William Brock or Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter. Mr. Brock was Mr. Yeutter's predecessor as trade representative.    Clarence Brown Jr., deputy commerce secretary, is next in command at the department and presumably will serve as acting secretary until Mr. Baldrige's successor is confirmed by the Senate. He is the son of a longtime Ohio Republican who served in the House. Bruce Smart, undersecretary of commerce for international trade, is another possible candidate. He runs the department's trade wing and was an executive in Continental Group Inc.    Mr. Baldrige's death also leaves a gap in the administration's strategy for handling the sweeping trade bill that goes into a Senate-House conference in early September. The White House had put him in charge of lobbying for sections of the bill relating to competitiveness and export controls.    The administration now will have one less effective opponent to provisions that would restrict the president's flexibility in responding to unfair trade practices by other nations. The absence of Mr. Baldrige also could strengthen the Pentagon's hand in lobbying for tougher export controls on high technology.    One of only three cabinet members who had served since 1981, Mr. Baldrige transformed an underpowered department dealing mostly with domestic business into a major player in trade policy. He spoke from personal experience. As president of Scovill Inc., a manufacturing conglomerate in Waterbury, Conn., he witnessed early inklings of declining U.S. competitiveness in the face of imports.    Initially, he loyally followed the administration's free-trade impulses but later brought the cabinet around to supporting stronger enforcement of trade laws as one way of stemming a protectionist wave in Congress. Several anti-dumping cases brought to his department's International Trade Administration led Mr. Baldrige to argue for stiff sanctions against Japan for breaching a 1986 semiconductor trade accord. Dumping is the selling of a product in a foreign market at a price lower than the domestic price.    &quot;Everyone in the cabinet signed on, including (Secretary of State) George Shultz,&quot; said a Baldrige aide.    At times, Mr. Baldrige went beyond other administration officials in seeking to protect beleaguered U.S. industries. While the rest of the cabinet maintained a discreet silence on Fujitsu Ltd.'s bid to acquire a majority interest in Fairchild Semiconductor Corp., Mr. Baldrige twice spoke publicly against the proposed merger. Fujitsu representatives complained bitterly about the Baldrige statements, but the company subsequently withdrew its offer largely because of the secretary's opposition.    But he refused to cave in to pressure from Wisconsin and California congressmen demanding the reversal of a Commerce Department plan to award a $40 million data-storage contract to Sony Corp. instead of a group of U.S. companies. &quot;If the U.S. companies involved had worked as hard at putting together competitive bids as it did complaining to Congress we'd all be better off,&quot; he said.    Mr. Baldrige also won a drawn out interagency dispute with the Pentagon over export-control policy. Last February, he effectively took the initiative from Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger by announcing several export-liberalizing steps under the rubric of enhancing U.S. &quot;competitiveness.&quot;    Although Mr. Baldrige dealt firmly with Japan, he also relented on occasion. He helped blunt some of the emotional congressional criticism of Toshiba Corp. by declaring he was &quot;satisfied&quot; with offers by the company and the Japanese government to make amends. </TEXT></DOC>
