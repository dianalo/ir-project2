We are told to quit linking sex with sinand to stop placing impossible moral burdens upon would-bechief executives. A.M. Rosenthal wrote in the New York Timeslast week that the only candidates he would reject on thisground would be rapists and virgins. Fortunately, themajority of Americans have not bought the argument. Mostcontinue to demand that the nation's foremost official be aperson of exceptionally good character, in private as well asin public.   Presidents have always served as national role models;this obligation comes with the job. And polls have shown thatthe public expects chief executives to possess a high degreeof integrity, fidelity, prudence, temperance and courage.Moreover, presidents constantly make decisions that affectthe lives of hundreds of millions -- and at times ofbillions. It is, I submit, neither priggish nor foolish towant a highly honorable person sitting in the Oval Office.</LP><TEXT>   To be sure, we must not expect a St. Francis; thecompromises and tactics required by American politicspreclude that. Still, most presidents have had at leastreasonably good character (Harding, Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson,and Nixon are exceptions, not the rule), and it seemssensible to continue if not to elevate the traditionalexpectation.   Sexual misbehavior, like theft or fraud, can be, dependingon the facts, a significant indicator of character. If, say,a married candidate had had a brief affair while overseasduring wartime, that might not automatically disqualify him,especially if he has sought forgiveness for the violation ofhis marital vows. On the other hand, if a married candidatehas carried on for years with a variety of women andcontinues to lie to his wife and to the public, we should behighly wary, even if the candidate espouses all of ourfavorite views.   At a time when a conservative candidate for the UnitedStates Supreme Court has been violently criticized in themedia for allegedly making lewd and suggestive remarks adecade earlier, one would think that this point would beobvious. Apparently it is not.   There is nothing new, by the way, about the desirabilityof linking good character with power; we have not suddenlyinvented a novel and impossible standard for our presidentialcandidates. Plato held his philosopher-kings to the highestmoral standards. Tacitus said of the Roman governor Agricola,&quot;To mention incorruptibility and self-denial in a man of hiscalibre would be to insult his virtues.&quot; The Renaissancehumanists, however secular and sophisticated they may havebeen, revered leaders who embodied the moral and intellectualvirtues inherent in the Judeo-Christian tradition. The samewas true of leaders of the Enlightenment. Thomas Jeffersonadmired George Washington's &quot;perfect&quot; character, callingattention to his integrity, prudence, dignity and sense ofjustice.   A strong moral sense of right and wrong is deeply imbeddedin American culture. The issue of character, rooted in thisconsensus, has arisen in almost every presidential campaign.   Good character, of course, is not all a president shouldpossess to be outstanding or even effective. PresidentsCoolidge, Hoover, Ford and Carter were men of integrity whodid not amount to much in the White House. One also needs,among other things, intelligence, knowledge, political savvy,energy, experience, sound advisers, communications skills andluck. But good character is vital, for it affects, directlyor indirectly, a great many of the decisions a chiefexecutive must make.   The Kennedy administration is a case in point. For all ofhis charm, courage and ability to inspire, John F. Kennedywas a man of very low personal morals. His clandestine andoften ruthless conduct during the Thousand Days with women,gangsters, drugs and CIA henchmen demeaned his high officeand exposed him to the possibility of blackmail. In a secondterm, Kennedy might have faced impeachment for one or more ofhis scandalous activities.   JFK's poor character can also be seen in the Bay of Pigsinvasion, Operation Mongoose, and the secret wars in Laos andSouth Vietnam. The president's overall lassitude in domesticaffairs and his initially cynical approach to civil rightscan be linked as well to his moral insensitivity.   Of course, America has had worse chief executives thanKennedy. To repeat, character is not everything. (Moreover,Kennedy's character was improving slightly late in his life.)Still, its importance should not be underestimated. Goodcharacter is an essential framework for the complex mixtureof qualities that make an outstanding president and a modelleader for a democratic people.   We all have a stake in finding presidents who will beworthy moral exemplars and who will use their vast powers inan honest, compassionate, responsible and fair way. So let'sexamine the lives of our candidates with extreme care. Andthat means looking at the whole person. If the recordincludes, say, adultery, fornication, and flagrantinsensitivity toward the opposite sex, let us face thosefacts when weighing a candidate's fitness for the WhiteHouse.   ---   Mr. Reeves, a professor at the University ofWisconsin-Parkside, is the author of &quot;A Question ofCharacter: A Life of John F. Kennedy&quot; (The Free Press, 1991).</TEXT></DOC>
