Three different plastics pipe materials have been used,i.e. polyethylene (PE), rigid PVC and impact modified PVC (PVC/CPE).The gas authority must consider the many and varied factors which willinfluence the choice of a particular material. Each material has itscharacteristic properties which will determine its field of applicationand the design concepts of the system. Since this will be a compromisebetween material properties and design, the advantages and disadvantagesof the system must be examined for each specific area of application.Factors which will influence the choice are a.o.: external loading conditions(soil and traffic loads, third party damage, etc.); internal loading(max. allowable internal pressure, gas composition); the material propertieslike long-term strength, ductility, stiffness, resistance to rapid crackpropagation; jointing methods; materials costs and laying costs. Theseabove mentioned factors are discussed for the plastics pipe materialsin operation in the Netherlands.</TEXT></DOC>
