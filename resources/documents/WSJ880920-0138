Charles Pistor, president of the American Bankers Association, said an association committee would recommend today that tax funds be used to deal with the growing problem and that the government step in to increase the pace of liquidation of insolvent thrifts.    The deterioration of the thrift industry and the Federal Savings andamp; Loan Insurance Corp. will be the single most dominant financial issue for bankers in 1989, Mr. Pistor said in a speech to the Iowa Bankers Association.    He estimated the bailout would cost between $50 billion and $100 billion, considerably more than predicted by the federal General Accounting Office, which estimates the cost of merging, closing or disposing of insolvent thrifts would range from $45 billion to $50 billion.    Mr. Pistor said the size of the problem was so large it left little alternative to using tax dollars to find a solution.    The FDIC insures an individual's deposits of as much as $100,000 at commercial banks, while the FSLIC provides similar insurance at thrifts. The insurance-funds are supported by premiums paid by the insured institutions.    &quot;Bankers across the country are concerned there could be a Saturday night massacre&quot; in which Congress would merge the $18 billion FDIC fund with the FSLIC, Mr. Pistor said in an interview before his speech. &quot;We are worried there could be confiscation of a fund built up by us.&quot;    Bankers also are worried about the practice of allowing insolvent thrifts to continue to operate, he said.    Mr. Pistor said the association's report would recommend:   --That the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which oversees thrifts, &quot;halt the growth of the 900 or more insolvent or nearly insolvent FSLIC-insured units.&quot;    --That the pace of liquidating insolvent thrifts be accelerated.    --That thrift regulations be tightened.    --That tax breaks be provided to assist in the acquisition of troubled thrifts.    He also said Congress should permit bank-holding companies to acquire and operate thrifts. </TEXT></DOC>
