By means of circular recording and by measuringthe high voltage at the X-ray tube it was quantitatively shown that theeffective voltage during exposure is (according to the exposure timeand the attenuation phase of the generator) always lower than the set-upvoltage of 120 kV. This phenomenon is the more marked the shorter theactual exposure time in comparison with the attenuation phase of thegenerator. The typical characteristic of a hard X-ray chest picture isthus not given only by the setting-up of voltage. The impact of the reductionin voltage is thus quantitatively shown also from the aspect of the radiationburden for the patient. (author). 7 figs., 8 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
