<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-95-0260 </DOCNO><TEXT>Twenty years of efforts to calculate the shell-model effective interaction,starting from the free nucleon-nucleon (NN) interaction and using many-bodyperturbation theory, are briefly reviewed. The author starts with a descriptionof the pioneering work of Kuo and Brown, in which the effective interactionwas approximated by the Bethe-Brueckner-Goldstone G-matrix and the lowestorder core-polarization correction. Then, subsequent developments arereviewed which cast doubt upon the simple Kuo-Brown approximation. Someof these problems have been shown to arise from inadequate treatmentof various higher order contributions, whereas other problems are relatedto the strong tensor component of the NN interaction used. In fact, modernmeson-exchange potentials have much weaker tensor forces and give riseto effective interactions which are similar to the original Kuo-Browninteraction. Applications of these new effective forces to shell-modelcalculations in the sd-shell are discussed. 40 refs.; 6 figs. Containssubject and author index.</TEXT></DOC>
