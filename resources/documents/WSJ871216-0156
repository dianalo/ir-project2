Baltimore-based First Maryland said the deferral gives it more &quot;flexibility&quot; if an opportunity to merge with another U.S. banking institution arises. Although First Maryland said no talks about such a merger are under way, the bank holding company acknowledged that recent developments in interstate banking inspired it to seek the deferral.    Dublin-based Allied Irish, which currently owns about 47% of First Maryland, began buying the bank holding company's common stock several years ago through a series of scheduled transactions.    First Maryland Chairman Jeremiah E. Casey said that if Allied Irish were to obtain a 51% interest, then his company would be considered a subsidiary of Allied Irish. As a subsidiary, it couldn't account for any future merger or combination with another U.S. bank under the &quot;pooling of interests&quot; accounting method, generally considered the most attractive option.    Originally, Allied Irish had expected to obtain a 51% stake in First Maryland by year end. Instead, Allied Irish will purchase 500,000 newly issued First Maryland shares Dec. 31 at $27.57 each, providing $13.8 million of new capital for First Maryland and raising Allied Irish's interest in First Maryland to 49.9%. </TEXT></DOC>
