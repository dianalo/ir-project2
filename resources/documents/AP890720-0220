An APcorrespondent visited the city recently as part of a tour conductedby the Soviet Foreign Ministry. Here are a few leaves from hisnotebook.</TEXT><BYLINE>By MICHAEL PUTZEL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>VLADIVOSTOK, U.S.S.R. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The hills of the long-forbiddenPacific port drop into the ocean, and as an evening fog settlesacross the water, a white, 30-foot fiberglass sloop drifts along theshore in a light breeze.   The sailboat flies no colors, and for a moment, the scene couldbe any port city anywhere. But on closer inspection, the boat yieldsa clue. A woman, standing in the cockpit, wears a shin-length cottondress instead of shorts, slacks or a swimsuit.   The woman might look out of place aboard a boat in a Westernharbor, but yachting clothes are practically unknown in the SovietFar East.   The port is Vladivostok, the headquarters of the Soviet PacificFleet on the Sea of Japan. Although ostensibly opened to foreignerslast year, the security-conscious city permits few tourists and hasnot yet adapted to its new status.</TEXT><TEXT>   A packet of picture postcards contains several views of the city,including some aerial views, but there is no sign of the Sovietfleet, the pride of Vladivostok. The docks at the city's center arecrowded with destroyers, cruisers, anti-submarine ships of variousdescriptions and an aircraft carrier under repair. Just around apoint from the downtown wharves, rows of nuclear-powered subs aretied up in submarine pens.   While much is made of the navy's multiethnic makeup, Vladivostoklooks as Russian as Moscow. In a city of more than 600,000 in theSoviet Far East, the appearance of people on the street testifies totheir European ancestry, and there are few signs of the Asiannationalities whose homelands are geographically much closer.</TEXT><TEXT>   Having been closed to tourism for so long, Vladivostok has noIntourist hotel, where foreigners are charged extraordinary ratesfor rooms that would be rented to Soviets for a fraction of theprice. As a result, when a group arrived from Moscow recently underthe sponsorship of the Soviet Foreign Ministry, those who paid uponarrival were charged $18.75 to $23.50 for a three-night stay.   When word spread that the guests were foreigners and should becharged the rate set by Intourist, the state tourism monopoly, thosewho had yet to pay were charged 10 times what the others had paid.</TEXT><TEXT>   Most of the city's architecture is of the same, monotonousconcrete-slab construction that characterizes other Soviet cities,but several pre-revolutionary buildings remain around the centralsquare. One is a former Japanese Consulate, built before theRusso-Japanese War at the turn of the century. It is now occupied bystate offices.   A building once famed for its French restaurant is beingrenovated and may one day serve fastidious diners again.   A few blocks away is one of the few visible signs that PresidentMikhail S. Gorbachev's economic reforms reach as far as Vladivostok.Chinese craftsmen are building a Chinese-Soviet joint-venturerestaurant.   A Soviet bystander professes amazement at the workers' attentionto detail as they fit perfectly symmetrical logs to frame atraditional, multistep pagoda-style roof over the entrance to theotherwise ordinary concrete block building.</TEXT><TEXT>   Expansionist Russia sent soldiers and pioneers to tame its FarEastern regions about the same time the American West was beingsettled. Vladivostok was founded in 1856, Khabarovsk on the AmurRiver two years later, Blagoveshchensk on the Chinese border also in1858.   In 1891, workers began building the Vladivostok railway station,which was to be the eastern terminus of the Trans-Siberian Railroad.   ``The design was copied from the Yaroslavl station'' in Moscow, aguide explains. ``It symbolizes the unity of Russia because peoplestarted out from Yaroslavl Station to get here.''   Even today, that is a seven-day journey.</TEXT><TEXT>   The quicker route is by plane, about nine hours from Moscow, butthere are few direct flights to Vladivostok. The airport is nolonger off limits but remains uninviting to civilian travelers.   Squadrons of long-range reconnaissance Bears and Badgermedium-range bombers, their sleek snouts cloaked in canvas or drapedin camouflage netting, are tucked into earthen revetments beside therunway, the red stars on their tails giving mute testimony to theprimary function of the military airfield.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Tues PMs July 25</NOTE></DOC>
