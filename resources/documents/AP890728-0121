Bush, responding to questions at a news conference, also said hehad not been in touch with the Israelis after their capture ofSheik Abdul Karim Obeid in the Lebanon village of Jibchit, 21 northof the Israeli border, earlier in the day.   Bush was asked whether Obeid's capture enhanced the cause ofpeace in the Middle East.   ``I don't think kidnapping and violence helps the cause ofpeace,'' he responded.   Sources in Lebanon said Obeid is considered Iran's closest allyand was linked to the abduction of Marine Lt. Col. William R.Higgins, head of the 75-man observer group attached to the U.N.Interim Force in Lebanon, on Feb. 17, 1988.   Higgins is one of nine Americans held in Lebanon, presumably bypro-Iranian Shiite Moslems.   Bush said he didn't know what ramifications the capture of Obeidwould have.   ``I can't tell you ... whether I think ... these two things caninteract _ the kidnapping and perhaps the subsequent release ofthis man _ whether that'll benefit the Higgins case or not,'' thepresident said.   He did say, however, that ``the freeing of Colonel Higgins isvery much on my mind and the freeing of the other hostages is.''   Bush said he had not contacted the Israelis, although otherAmericans had. ``This thing ... just happened.''   Obeid is reputed to be the spiritual guide of Hezbollah, orParty of God, in south Lebanon.   He has repeatedly denied, however, any ties with the pro-Iraniangroup, which is affiliated with factions holding most of the 17foreign hostages in Lebanon. Nine Americans are among the hostages.</TEXT></DOC>
