Research at Sandia National Laboratories is directedat this application, as well as batch manufacturing.andP;  One problemis that traditional systems used for handling hazardous materialor accomplishing batch manufacturing do not work in many cases.andO;Teaching the robots can be expensive, difficult or impossible andfixturing is expensive or difficult.andP;  The difficulties inherent inprogramming robots can be overcome with automatic programmingmethods.andP;  This is accomplished with various forms ofcomputer-based reasoning.andP;  The Sandia algorithm andsoftware-related research and development for automated mechanicalassembly are outlined.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     RobotsResearch and DevelopmentRobotics IndustryMechanical EngineeringSandia LaboratoriesHazardous MaterialsManufacturing.andO;Feature:   illustrationphotograph.andM;</DESCRIPT></DOC>
