(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A Titan rocket today propelled intospace a secret military payload that a civilian expert identifiedas a satellite capable of eavesdropping on Soviet military anddiplomatic communications.   The powerful, 16-story-tall Titan 34D, scoring its thirdstraight success after being grounded for 18 months, thundered fromits launch pad at 8:05 a.m.   The Air Force did not announce the launch in advance, which hasbeen its practice on military space flights, and afterward saidonly that the Titan 34D, ``carrying a classified militarypayload,'' was successfully launched.   John E. Pike, a space policy expert for the Washington-basedFederation of American Scientists, said last month the payloadwould be a satellite to monitor Soviet missile tests and radio,telephone, radar and other electronic military and diplomaticcommunications.   He said the payload carried an antenna built to unfold to thesize of a baseball field.   Pike said the satellite project originally was code-named Chaletbut was changed to Vortex when Chalet became known. Vortex becamecompromised some time ago and yet another name may have beensubstituted, he said.   The Titan 34D will remain the nation's most powerful unmannedrocket until an upgraded version, the Titan 4, makes its launchdebut later this year, also with a military satellite. Both aremade by Martin Marietta in Denver.   A Titan 34D carrying a reconnaissance satellite was launched inOctober from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif. Another blasted awayfrom Cape Canaveral a month later and placed in orbit a satelliteto provide warning of a missile attack.   Before the October launch, the Titan 34D had been groundedfollowing two straight explosions of the rocket.</TEXT></DOC>
