Everybody. Please.;    This was the final pleaMonday from a group of leaders who propose a radical new regional governmentas the only way the Bay Area can solve problems that cross politicalboundaries: sprawl, traffic, smog and expensive housing.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Local  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  PANEL CALLS FOR BAY AREA REGIONAL RULE  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Also ran, with photo of Rod Diridon, on p. 2B Morning Final Edition  </MEMO><TEXT>     The Bay Vision 2020 Commission has laid out a plan to merge the alphabetsoup of regional agencies that now control everything from transit to low-rentapartments. And they've designed one mega-agency to oversee growth anddevelopment from Silicon Valley to Napa Valley.;    On Monday, the blue-ribbonpanel turned its idea over to a mightier force -- the California Legislature,which in 1992 could authorize a regional Bay Area government that would be amodel for the nation.;    &quot;Now comes the hard work,&quot; said Santa Clara CountySupervisor Rod Diridon, who helped form the Bay Vision 2020 Commission 18months ago. &quot;We have to convert this theoretical and conceptual idea intosomething that will be accepted by the California public.&quot;;    Monday was thelast official meeting of the 32-member panel of minority, education, industryand environmental leaders. The group spent nearly 18 months studying solutionsto the growing problems of housing, transportation and unchecked growth.;   &quot;We found that the Bay Area quality of life is in jeopardy,&quot; said Ira MichaelHeyman, chairman of Bay Vision 2020 and former chancellor of the University ofCalifornia, Berkeley. &quot;Livability will be lost unless we have an effectivemeans of dealing with problems that cross boundaries.&quot;;    A smaller group,the Bay Vision Action Coalition, will now lobby for growth management bills inSacramento. The recommendations Bay Vision hopes to put into law are:;   (check) Consolidate the Bay Area's existing regional air quality, transit andplanning agencies into a single commission. It would administer the laws andprograms now overseen by the Bay Area Air Quality Management District, theMetropolitan Transportation Commission and the Association of Bay AreaGovernments.;    (check) Give the new nine-county regional commissionauthority to veto major local development decisions if they would have adetrimental impact on the Bay Area.;    (check) Share sales and property taxesregionally, so cities and counties have as much incentive to build housing asindustrial parks that bring in higher tax revenues.;    (check) Set urbangrowth limits, so development would be concentrated and there would be lesspressure to build in open spaces.;    (check) Set criteria for the location ofregional necessities nobody wants, such as airports, garbage dumps andfreeways.;    Public hearings will be held in September in each of thecounties involved in the proposed regional government. The Bay Vision ActionCoalition will use this public input when the growth management bills arewritten late this year.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  LISA LAPIN, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Oakland  </CITY><EDITION>  Peninsula/AM  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910625  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  June  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  466  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday June 25, 199100177131,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
