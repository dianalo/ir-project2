Roughly 2,000 Nicaraguan soldiers had been reported in themountainous area Thursday, the day after Honduras said they crossedthe frontier pursuing Contra rebels. A ranking Honduran officersaid 1,000 of them remained on the Honduran side Friday.   About 800 American paratroopers _ among the last to arrive ofthe 3,200 soldiers sent to Honduras _ were dropped onto Palmerolaair base Friday morning. The Defense Department says the U.S.forces will be in Central America for a 10-day training exercise.   Gen. Fred F. Woerner, commander of the U.S. Southern Commandbased in Panama, arrived to review the exercise and said it was ``areassuring factor to our allies, not only in Honduras butelsewhere.''   He said there were ``some very, very preliminary'' indicationsthat Sandinista troops were beginning to withdraw, but the durationof the U.S. exercise was ``not necessarily'' linked to that.   The Honduran officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, saidtwo Honduran infantry battalions totaling 1,600 to 2,000 soldierswere moving in from a base at Juticalpa, about 90 miles west. Hesaid warplanes were on call from the Tamara air base 15 miles northof Tegucigalpa.   Orders were given for the soldiers to expel the ``invadingtroops'' with whatever means necessary, he said, adding that abouthalf the original force had fled to Nicaragua. Honduran soldiersbegan sweeping the border region for mines Thursday but none hadbeen found, he reported.   Honduras gave the Sandinistas 24 hours to get their soldiers outof the country, but the time of the deadline was not stated.   The Sandinistas have denied entering Honduras but a Nicaraguanmilitary source indicated privately that they had.   Nicaragua's northern military headquarters is near the frontierin Bocay and Honduran warplanes flew raids in the area Thursday,hours after U.S. troops began arriving in Honduras.   U.S. Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci said the American troopsfrom the 82nd Airborne and 7th Light Infantry were sent on a 10-daytraining exercise to provide ``moral support'' and would be keptaway from combat.   Pentagon officials said privately the four U.S. battalions wouldspend eight or nine days training with Hondurans in different partsof the country.   One battalion of the 82nd Airborne will be at Juticalpa, anofficial said, ``but anyone who knows the country'' would realizethe 90 miles ``might as well be 4,000. There's nothing butmountains and jungle in between.''   ``The basic order that these troops aren't to get near thefighting still stands,'' he said.   President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua said Thursday his soldierswere ready to ``combat and liquidate'' the 82nd Airborne ifnecessary.   Alejandro Bendana, secretary-general of the Nicaraguan ForeignMinistry, said ``one step ... could lead to another'' in the borderconflict, indicating war might result.   The U.S.-supported Contras have secret bases in Honduras fromwhich to attack across the border in their 6-year-old battle withthe Sandinistas.   Manuel Suarez, spokesman for the Honduran armed forces, toldlocal reporters President Jose Azcona Hoyo would continue telephoneconversations with Ortega and other Central American leaders,trying ``to avoid a break in the peace process that has beendeveloping in the region.''   Among provisions of the peace plan signed by the five CentralAmerican countries Aug. 7 are cease-fires in civil wars and a banon the use of one country's territory for attacks on another.   Azcona, 60, has been reported ill with flu for several days andcanceled several meetings. The daily newspaper La Prensa said hewas dealing with the situation from his home.   La Prensa printed an editorial cartoon in which Uncle Sam said``There's an invasion in Honduras'' while Azcona, a member of thearmed forces and a diplomat look around saying, ``Where, where,where?''   Members of the legislature demanded a meeting with ForeignMinister Carlos Lopez to be told why they were not asked to approveAzcona's request that American soldiers be sent in.   Reports on Thursday's air raids conflicted.   Nicaragua's Foreign Ministry blamed the United States and made aformal protest.   Reagan administration officials said one of Nicaragua'sSoviet-supplied helicopters was destroyed, but the Sandinistasdenied it. Nicaragua is believed to have more than 40 militaryhelicopters.   Honduras said its air force attacked only inside its ownterritory.   Suarez, the military spokesman, said the Honduran air forceraided along the border near San Andres de Bocay, site of theSandinista military headquarters in northern Nicaragua.   Reporters flown to San Andres de Bocay saw two jet aircraft,unidentified, fly in from Honduras just after noon Thursday anddrop at least five bombs near the border.</TEXT></DOC>
