(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Miracle cures and cheaper, healthier food areon the horizons of biotechnology, but for companies able to copewith the regulatory patchwork of the embryonic industry the futureholds huge earnings.   The Industrial Biotechnology Association predicts that sales, nowestimated at $600 million, will rise to between $25 billion and $30billion in the year 2000 and between $75 billion and $100 billion in2025.   ``The first impact is going to clearly be on the medical side,''said James McCamant, editor of Medical Technology Stock Letter inBerkeley, Calif.   Genetically engineered products to cure AIDS and some cancers, tomake pork and beef leaner and healthier, and to protect crops frominsects, weeds and the weather, are just a few of the promises heldout by the industry.   ``You will see biotechnology products all over the shelves in thenext few years. It will creep into your life and continue toaccelerate. Fifteen years from now we can't even speculate,''McCamant said.   The United States remains the leader in all aspects ofbiotechnology _ diagnostics, medicine, forensics and agriculture,analysts say. But Japan and Western European nations are makinginroads, partly due to a strong government role in financing and, insome cases, looser regulations.   ``Funding for the basic sciences has gone down in the last 10years. We're being hit pretty hard by the Germans, the English andthe Japanese,'' said Jim Gramlich, director of the American CyanamidCo. agriculture research center in Princeton.   California, Massachusetts, Wisconsin, North Carolina and NewJersey are the states having the most companies with biotechconnections, said IBA spokeswoman Sherrod Shim. States benefit intaxes and jobs by supporting biotechnology, and can be good sourcesof startup funds, say state biotech center officials.   However, in the long run, the New Jersey Center for AdvancedBiotechnology and Medicine hopes to attract federal support andbacking from pharmaceutical companies, said Robert Namovicz, thecenter's executive director.   Agencies like the National Institutes of Health and NationalScience Foundation have responded to challenges from abroad inrecent years with more grants to universities and industry, but noteveryone sees that as an answer.   ``They are good to a certain point. They're more directed towardthe research and what we're really about is developing a commercialproduct,'' said Don Reed, chief financial officer of Massachusetts'Cambridge BioScience Corp.   U.S. companies have not yet taken their business to countrieswith looser regulations, such as France or Italy, said Jeff Gibbs,one of three authors of ``Biotechnology and The Environment:International Regulation.''   But it could happen, Gibbs said, even though the EuropeanCommunity is studying whether to establish uniform rules that wouldprobably lean toward those in countries like Denmark and WestGermany, where the stronger influence of environmental groups hasled to tougher regulation.   What companies are doing is taking advantage of the newness ofthe U.S. regulatory environment. The Patent and Trademark Office,facing a backlog of more than 6,000 biotech applications, asked theindustry association in early November to train more patentexaminers to handle the caseload.   All over the country, companies are racing to develop newproducts.   Cetus Corp., of Emeryville, Calif., has worked to developpolymerase chain reaction which lets scientists magnify a singlepiece of DNA, the molecule that carries genetic information. Cetuspresident Robert Fildes said PCR simplifies diagnosticians' task offinding viruses from infected cells. It can determine in hours if acell has been infected with AIDS, for example, something that wouldtake six weeks using tests in a culture medium, Fildes said.   Lifecodes Corp., of Tarrytown, N.Y., is offering DNA tests todetermine the guilt or innocence of criminal suspects from bodyfluids. Company spokeswoman Karen Wexler said Lifecodes will soonoffer a kit that tests DNA samples of suspects' blood or semen tomatch them to samples taken from the crime.   Turf battles between federal agencies trying to decidejurisdiction for each new biotechnology product and the constantlychanging science complicate the task of companies seeking a piece ofthe market, said Jan Kurtz, with the science advisory board for thefederal Environmental Protection Agency.   ``We're trying to make a patchwork quilt,'' Ms. Kurtz said.``It's not easy to promulgate new legislation. The questions are allnew.''   Faye Peterson, a Food and Drug Administration spokeswoman, saidthe regulatory process does not differ greatly from other productssubmitted to the agency. Regulation levels are appropriate and donot require further expansion, an assessment shared by most companyofficials, she said.   However, Mike Cannell of the Wisconsin Family Farm Defense Fund,Inc., a group opposed to biotechnology in agriculture for economicand safety reasons, said, ``It doesn't take a black heart to imaginethe worst when the chemical companies are supplying most of theregulatory data.''   Groups like Cannell's and the Washington, D.C.-based Foundationon Economic Trends contend the dangers of biotechnology haven't beensufficiently examined. Critics point to herbicides and pesticidesthat were once considered harmless and have been proven to pollutegroundwater as reason to doubt the motives of any industry that isbeing regulated.   The industry says fears of genetically engineered bacteriarunning wild mislead the public and legislators into seeking totoughen the regulatory road.   ``The risks are sometimes greatly exaggerated of nature gonewild. We all grew up on the same movies of giant spiders thatescaped laboratories and ate Chicago,'' said Hugh 'Andrade,executive vice president of Schering-Plough Corp. in Madison andvice chairman of the industry association.   More plausible dangers involve weed-control experiments thatcould backfire with the wrong gene implanted, letting the weedreproduce, and even that would be highly improbable becauseresearchers start experiments with some idea of which genesaccomplish what ends, D'Andrade said.   The specialized knowledge and costly equipment required will keepthe technology out of the wrong hands, and regulation coupled withcompanies' wish not to damage their credibility will keep productsfrom being rushed onto the market without proper safeguards, he said.   Lisa Drake, a spokeswoman for Monsanto Co. in St. Louis, said thecompany is used to regulatory mazes but it's harder for smallerfirms. ``We're used to working within those kinds of boundaries. Buta lot of smaller companies are bothered by regulations because it'sso expensive and takes so much time.''   Smaller companies living off initial investment capital all feelpressure in an uncertain market to put products on the shelves, saidAmerican Cyanamid's Gramlich. ``They can only survive so long insavings and research contracts. I don't think any company can put 50to 60 percent into research as some of these have and survive long.''   Smaller companies like Epitope Inc. of Beaverton, Ore., can nolonger ask investors to wait, as in the early days of biotechnology,said Michael Hubbard, president. ``They're not satisfied withcompanies any more that say, `We're going to lose money for six orseven years.'   ``We've geared our work to very applicable things rather thanheading into long-term things like cancer treatment.''   The competition also could reduce the number of companies.Executives predict one-third of the industry will be acquired withinfive years and nearly half within 10 years, according to ``Biotech89: Commercialization,'' a report by Arthur Young Co. Analysts haveexpected that to happen for some time.   ``The progress of commercial biotechnology is unfolding withremarkable logic,'' said the report. ``Neither unexpected challenges(the stock market collapse) nor fully expected challenges(regulatory issues, patent disputes) have stalled an industry thathas begun to show its strength.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Dec. 22</NOTE></DOC>
