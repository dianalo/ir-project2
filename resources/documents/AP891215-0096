(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The 4-year-old boy watched as thetelevision news flashed a picture of jailed South African blackleader Nelson Mandela.   The somewhat dated photograph did not make an impression on thechild, the second generation of Mandela's family who has had to seehim from afar.   ``That's how he used to look,'' the child's mother, MakaziweMandela, said Wednesday as she watched the report of a historicmeeting between her father and South African President F.W. deKlerk.   The South African Press Association said there was speculationde Klerk could announce a date for Mandela's release in a speechSaturday commemorating the Day of the Vow, a major holiday for theAfrikaners who control the government.   Although many predict Mandela will be released in January, hisdaughter is suspicious of the white-led government that imprisonedher father in 1962.   ``Being a South African and having grown up in South Africa, Istill have the negative feeling that they've got something up theirsleeve,'' she said from her modest apartment near the University ofMassachusetts, where she is a Fulbright scholar studyinganthropology.   But that doesn't stop her from hoping.   ``As a daughter there is a little bit of excitement ... At leastI am hoping,'' said Makaziwe Mandela, 35, who last saw her fatherearlier this year. ``I barely know my father.''   The youngest of three children from Mandela's first marriage,``Maki'' Mandela was 8 years old when her father went to prison.She saw little of him when she was growing up, and she said havinga heroic figure for a father was sometimes difficult.   Seeing other children with fathers at home, or hearing of somein the movement who had left the country with their families, shequestioned why her father allowed himself ``to get caught and go tojail.''   But by her mid-20s, she ``came slowly to the realization of whymy father had done what he had done,'' she says.   In 1985, she decided to come to the United States to study. Herhusband, Isaac Amuah, a schoolteacher, later joined her and ispursuing postdoctoral studies. They live here with their threeyoung children and plan to return to South Africa, where she hopesto resume work as a community social worker.   Wednesday, the 71-year-old Mandela visited de Klerk to discussprospects for negotiating an end to South Africa's racial conflict,the first meeting between the two.   The meeting was denounced by the far-right Conservative Party inSouth Africa and hailed by liberal leaders as a sign that de Klerk,who took office Aug. 15, accepts Mandela's outlawed guerrillamovement, the African National Congress, as playing a central rolein any political settlement.   The black leader's daughter said she's unsure how to read theactions of de Klerk, who on Oct. 15 ordered the unconditionalrelease of seven of Mandela's ANC colleagues.   ``It is a change. Whether it is a positive change or a negativechange I think history will be the better judge,'' she said.   But she said she doubts her father would stay free for longunless changes are made in the system.   ``Unless they give him (a larger role) to play, then I am sad tosay that I think Mandela will go back to jail because he won't sitquietly and accept the system that he tried to bring down,'' shesaid.   And she said she sees no signs of sweeping changes in SouthAfrica along the lines of the changes in Eastern Europe.   ``The biggest challenge facing South Africa is not really theremoval of apartheid _ everybody already knows that apartheid isgoing away _ but to change the attitudes of people,'' she said.``Getting rid of those attitudes is going to be the big problem.''</TEXT></DOC>
