The commission, which includes five current or pastnational party chairmen, also recommends that each of themajor television networks allocate three hours of air timefor use by the parties and presidential candidates in themonths leading to the presidential election.</LP><TEXT>   The commission suggests that during the parties' air time,only the presidential and vice-presidential candidates bepermitted to address the public. The use of pre-producedmaterials such as taped candidate biographies would bebarred.   Democratic Party Chairman Ronald Brown already hasindicated his willingness to tinker with the nationalpolitical convention. He is toying with proposals either tocompress the proceedings or to conduct some of them over aweekend, rather than during the week.   Commission members said taking a day off the conventionswould make the proceedings seem less tedious. &quot;We've got tomake them more enlightening and better to watch,&quot; said formerGOP Chairman Frank Fahrenkopf.</TEXT></DOC>
