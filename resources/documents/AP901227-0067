(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The callup of reservists for the PersianGulf buildup is striking medical care hard in rural America,leaving some small towns without doctors and forcing retiredphysicians back to work.   Dr. Victor Hoefner Jr., 70, was enjoying his retirement lastmonth when his son, Dr. Victor C. Hoefner III, an Army NationalGuardsman, was called up for duty the Persian Gulf.   Now the elder Hoefner has taken over his son's family practicein this western Colorado community.   The Pentagon won't say how many doctors have been called up,citing security. In addition to the activation of members of theArmy, Navy and Air Force reserves, the Army has begun forcing someretired medical officers back into uniform.   The effect of the callup is quickly felt in small towns, and theindefinite duration of the crisis is adding to the problem,according to rural health experts.   ``Are we talking three months, six months or a year?'' askedToby Turner, spokeswoman for the National Rural Health Associationin Kansas City.   ``Rural health has been in crisis anyway, and losing 50 percentof your small hospital's staff at one time is just too much of ablow. The military is just filling slots in these units withoutpaying any attention to a medical reservist's role at home.''   ``The pattern we're seeing is that when people are called from asmall community, it's felt much more because the likelihood of acritical position being affected is greater and the likelihood ofhaving adequate backup is less than a large hospital,'' said AlChechik, spokesman for the Wisconsin Hospital Association.   The call-up of physicians, nurses and technicians has thepotential to strip the U.S. Public Health Service staffs on Indianreservations, although not too many have been called as yet,officials said.   The Public Health Service hospital in Crownpoint, N.M., servingNavajos and other tribes in the area, lost its only ear, nose andthroat specialist.   ``The Public Health Service is part of the armed services, andwe sign a statement that we can be pulled for non-combatant duty,''said Dr. Annie Kusava, a pediatrician in Crownpoint, who carriesthe rank of lieutenant colonel.   In Verdigre, Neb., the lone physician was called up, leaving thenortheast Nebraska community of 617 without a doctor.   Dr. Ken Pavlik, an Army Reservist, leaves a medical clinic andpatients in the Knox County hospital and nursing home.   He arranged for Dr. D.J. Nagengast, who lives 25 miles away inBloomfield, to make rounds and check on his patients.   ``There is no question that this is going to be an inconvenienceto a lot of people,'' Pavlik said.   While the number of physicians pulled out of rural areasapparently isn't great, their departure leaves a far larger gapthan would that of their big-city counterpart.   ``It hurts the rural hospitals where there have been shortagesanyway,'' said Pete Moberg, spokesman for St. Mary's Hospital inGrand Junction.   St. Mary's is a regional hospital, with accident victims oremergency surgery patients transferred from lesser-equipped ruralhospitals.   ``If a little hospital loses its doctor and a scrub nurse,there's going to be no surgery done there at all,'' Moberg said.   St. Mary's is receiving more patient referrals from doctors andother hospitals in the Western Slope region because of the call-up,Moberg said.   Dr. Jose Luis Rodriguez, the only plastic surgeon in GlenwoodSprings, 90 miles east of Grand Junction, closed his office andreferred patients to doctors in Grand Junction after he wasactivated. He is a lieutenant colonel in the National Guard.   In Wyoming, even more sparsely populated than Colorado, thereare only about 600 doctors in the entire state and seven arealready gone or on standby.   ``In a state like Wyoming, the impact of losing physicians isgreat,'' said Rich Johnson, executive director of the WyomingMedical Society. ``There are not a lot of choices in medical carein many communities.''</TEXT></DOC>
