<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-52-0635 </DOCNO><TEXT>In the first half of this paper, the authors describe briefly a recenttheoretical approach where the mechanism of the large-amplitude dissipativecollective motions can be investigated on the basis of the microscopictheory of nuclear collective dynamics. Namely, we derive the generalcoupled master equations which can disclose, in the framework of theTDHF theory, not only non-linear dynamics among the collective and thesingle-particle modes of motion but also microscopic dynamics responsiblefor the dissipative processes. In the latter half, the authors investigate,without relying on any statistical hypothesis, one possible microscopicorigin which leads us to the transport equation of the Fokker-Plancktype so that usefullness of the general framework is demonstrated.</TEXT></DOC>
