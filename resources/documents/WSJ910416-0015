Chairman Robert C. Stempelwas the lowest paid chief executive officer among the BigThree auto makers in 1990, taking a 51% cut in compensationthat reflected GM's loss last year.   Mr. Stempel, who took over as chairman in August, receiveda total of $1,074,695, down from $2.2 million he earned in1989 when he was GM's No. 2 officer, according to thecompany's proxy statement.</LP><TEXT>   Earlier this year, Mr. Stempel said he and other senior GMexecutives wouldn't receive bonuses in the face of the No. 1auto maker's $2 billion loss for 1990. Ford Motor Co.Chairman Harold A. Poling, who also received no bonus lastyear, earned $1.2 million.   By contrast, Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee A. Iacoccareceived $4.6 million in salary and stock last year, a 15%raise from a year ago. Much of Mr. Iacocca's compensationcame in the form of stock granted in return for remaining onthe job past his retirement date.   The United Auto Workers union, in a customary gesture ofprotest, said that even with the elimination of most bonuses,the amounts paid to GM's top officers were &quot;still too much,way too much.&quot; However, the UAW's criticism of GM was mutedcompared with its blast at Mr. Iacocca last week. &quot;This maybe good news on Rodeo Drive, but it's bad news for Americanconsumers, American workers . . .,&quot; the UAW said ofChrysler's executive pay.</TEXT></DOC>
