And it bailed them out of the Great Depression.   Market prices for most commodities crept up in the monthsfollowing Germany's Sept. 1, 1939, invasion of Poland. The price ofhorses, however, barely moved.   President Roosevelt's secretary of agriculture, Henry A. Wallace,advised farmers to proceed with 1940 production plans ``as if theoutbreak in Europe had not occurred.''   The farm price of cotton in August 1939 averaged 8.7 cents perpound. Corn brought less than 48 cents a bushel, and wheat was about55 cents nationally, on the average.   Horses were reported by USDA in the month before the start ofWorld War II at $78 per head.   Six months later, in February 1940, the department reported thefarm prices of cotton at 9.97 cents per pound, corn at 55 cents abushel, and wheat at 84 cents per bushel.   Horses gained only 20 cents, averaging $78.20 each in February1940.   Early predictions of demand for farm products remained guarded.   ``European war has not stimulated, it has diminished, the exportdemand for farm products,'' the March 1940 report said. ``UnitedStates exports of tobacco and fruits have been greatly reduced.   ``Exports of pork and lard are not up to the volume that wouldflow normally in a year of large production and low prices. Exportsales of cotton have been good but have declined recently. Littlewheat is going abroad.''   Some increases in U.S. domestic demand were reported as warclouds deepened. But U.S. industrial production had not yet gearedup, and the outlook for agriculture was clouded.   ``There seems little in the picture now that would justify anyexpansion in farm production this year (1940) in excess of domestic_ plus limited export _ needs for foods and fibers,'' USDAeconomists intoned.   But in May 1940, after the fall of France and as Britain'stattered army prepared for its evacuation from Dunkirk, the USDA'sanalysts reported:   ``News comes of a quick change in the European political frontand yeast of commodity speculation rises. Wheat goes to highestprices in three years, feed grains follow, hog prices climb, too.''   Massive U.S. aid to Britain, including food and clothing, and abuildup in American military forces would gradually put the UnitedStates on a war footing. Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, settled anyremaining doubts.   Doug Bowers, the department's historian, says World War IIbrought epic changes to American agriculture.   Since World War I in 1914-18, the main problem in U.S.agriculture had been over-production, he said in a telephoneinterview. But with the 1939-45 conflict, ``they needed fullproduction for wartime,'' Bowers said.   ``This coincided with a very important change in Americanagriculture,'' he said. ``That was the widespread adoption ofchemicals _ fertilizer and pesticides _ and also the continuedmechanization of agriculture.''   The war didn't contribute directly to mechanization, simplybecause factories that normally turned out tractors and combineswere building guns and tanks.   ``But in the Midwest, for example, farmers who had neverfertilized before at all began using fertilizer on crops,'' Bowerssaid. ``It began a long trend in upward productivity in Americanagriculture.''   There were domestic price controls and rationing during World WarII, he said. Even so, there was inflation as families soughtproducts for wartime incomes.   ``The farmer came out of World War II in better economic shapethan he'd been in for a quarter of a century, since the end of WorldWar I,'' Bowers said.   As the war drew to a close, there was some concern thatagriculture might suffer the same kind of collapse that happened inthe 1920s _ a harbinger of the Great Depression _ when the farmeconomy was burdened by the loss of wartime markets and high prices.   Government price supports were kept at relatively high levelsthrough World War II and for some time afterward, just in case, hesaid. But U.S. aid to a war-torn world required a large output byfarmers. The outbreak of the Korean War in 1950 also was a factor.   ``It wasn't until the mid-1950s that surpluses were a seriousproblem again,'' Bowers said.   By February 1943, with the allied invasion of Nazi-held Europestill more than a year away, the economists at USDA noted that``food production was expanded greatly'' in 1942 and that more wasneeded.   ``When the great victory drives in Europe and the Far East getunder way, food production will become more and more important inrelation to other war production,'' they said. ``Food requirementswill become acute with the liberation of Axis-occupied territories.''   The report also showed the farm price of cotton at 19.7 cents perpound, corn at 88 cents per bushel, and wheat at $1.18 per bushel.   Horses were not included in the February 1943 agriculturalsituation report. Tanks and tractors had taken their toll.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday Aug. 27</NOTE></DOC>
