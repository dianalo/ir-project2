A total of 125 taxa were collected from the mixed zone of L-Lakein 1986 and 105 taxa from the mixed zone in 1987. Of the taxa identified,the microzooplankton accounted for 103 taxa (59 protozoans and 44 rotifers:82.4% of all taxa) in 1986 and 88 taxa (53 protozoans and 35 rotifers:83.8% of all taxa) in 1987. Taxa richness for each of the major taxonomicgroups in the mixed zone ranged from 42 to 47 protozoans, 27 to 31 rotifers,eight to 11 cladocerans, seven to nine copepods, and one ostracod ineach region in 1986 and 39 to 44 protozoans, 21 to 27 rotifers, sevento nine cladocerans, six to seven copepods and one ostracod in each regionin 1987.</TEXT></DOC>
