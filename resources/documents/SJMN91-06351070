Amid all of this constant activity, Abdulherself was a sort of perky, pudgy nonentity who couldn't really dance or singor be entertaining in any substantive way. Yes, she did hit a few high,squealy notes, and she did move with the rest of the cast. But she neverreally did much of anything to speak of.;   And when this non-presence wascombined with songs that were the musical equivalent of cotton candy, well, itmade for a performance that transcended dull and dreary and dismal. It wasn'teven boring. It simply wasn't, period.;   Droning synthesized chords openedthe performance, as a gondola was lowered to the stage amid flashing lights.Abdul rolled off it and was soon surrounded by dancers and the aforementionedtwo on stilts. And as the beats kicked in, she strutted about the stagebleating the vocals to &quot;Spellbound.&quot;;   It wasn't particularly spellbinding.;  She then made her way to a video screen that flashed various images ofdancers doing their thing before heading for a hydraulic platform that raisedher to a new level -- stage level -- for a wispy reading of &quot;The Promise Of ANew Day.&quot; It sounded a bit like Madonna; or rather, like a shopping mallmaven's imitation of the Blonde One.;   But the fans seemed to like it --probably because most of the young girls who made up the majority of thetwo-thirds capacity crowd looked like they had just come by after a stint atValley Fair.;   But I digress.;   The rest of the 1 1/2-hour show was notableprimarily for the way it looked. Abdul's choreography was decent enough; andthe post-modernist costumes of the funky &quot;Vibeology&quot; were breathtaking; andthe floating dancers (suspended by minute wires) of &quot;Blowing Kisses in theWind&quot; elicited oooooh's from the crowd.;   But whenever it got down to Abdul,there wasn't any There there. Her videos notwithstanding, Abdul in personcouldn't dance her way out of a loose leotard. Her movements were uniformlystarchy and mechanical (especially when compared with the lithe acrobatics ofthe rest of the cast). And when she was forced to sing a melody, she simplycouldn't do it. &quot;Rush Rush&quot; was a modest ballad that eluded Abdul's minisculevocal range.;   The low point of this show came when Abdul danced about withan animated cat, M.C. Skat Kat, who rapped and strutted behind her on a videoscreen. As she made her way to the lower stage level, a dancer in a cat suitappeared and the two cavorted about in a cloying, cutesy routine.;   What?;  What, indeed. This wasn't a performance. It was a splashy, stagy pose. It wasa scam. It was shameless and shameful. And a sham. Pop can be commercial andcontrived and all the while maintain a certain level of taste and integrityand expertise.;   Abdul's vapid performance had none of these. Instead it wasa show-off, showing off, but with nothing to show.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  HARRY SUMRALL, Mercury News Music Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911216  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  December  </MONTH><PG.COL>  3C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  581  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday, December 16, 199100351070,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
