SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   When the House of Representatives shifts seatsfrom one state to another following the 1990 Census, some of thechanges may be caused by people living in Korea, Germany and otherforeign nations.   A House subcommittee voted Thursday to require that Americansliving overseas be counted in the census for purposes ofreapportionment.   Traditionally, they have not been included in the count becausethe census is designed to distribute House seats among states, andpeople overseas do not reside in any particular state.   But in recent years the question has become an emotional issue,with some politicians questioning the policy of counting illegalaliens who live in the United States, but excluding citizens whohappen to be living abroad.   The Constitution requires that apportionment be based on a countof all the people residing in the states. Thus, illegal aliens arecounted because they do reside in the country.   The bill approved by the House census subcommittee calls for acount of all Americans living outside the country. For purposes ofHouse seats, those people would be considered residents ofwhichever state they last lived in for a period of at least sixmonths.   The bill now goes to the full Post Office and Civil Servicecommittee. It's future is uncertain.   The Justice Department has raised questions about theconstitutionality of apportioning among the states people livingoveraseas.   The Commerce Department, parent agency of the Census Bureau,also opposes the requirement, contending that it would not haveenough time to plan and budget for the large and costly overseaseffort, and pointing out that administrative records do not existto show the past residence of many people.   The Census Bureau has reached an agreement with the DefenseDepartment to count military personnel overseas. Pentagon officialslast year estimated that there were 506,000 military personnel and385,000 of their dependents in foreign posts.   However, there are also unknown numbers of federal civilianworkers and their dependents overseas. These include employees of11 cabinet departments and 17 different federal agencies, spreadacross 160 foreign nations, according to the Office of PersonnelManagement.   There are also Americans in private business living overseas,and no records are kept of them.   Past efforts to estimate the number of overseas residents whocome from various states have run into problems. Many militarypersonnel, for example, listed as home the coastal community fromwhich they shipped out or, in other cases, claimed as their usualresidence one of the states which has no personal income tax.   If the measure should become law, however, it could have animpact on the number of House seats distributed to various statesfollowing the 1990 Census.   The private Election Data Services company estimated in Aprilthat a 18 states stand to gain or lose House seats following thathead count.   But while that company's figures showed Pennsylvania losingthree House seats, the state was only 14,762 residents short ofretaining one of those seats. Minnesota, on the other hand, heldonto one of its seats by a margin of only 5,390 people.   Thus, if the overseas count boosted Pennsylvania at the expenseof Minnesota, a House seat could easily shift between those twostates. Other shifts might also be possible, depending on whichstates gained or lost in the overseas count.   The other side of the apportionment coin, counting illegalaliens, remains at issue, with the matter currently before afederal court.   Rep. Mervyn M. Dymally, D-Calif., chairman of the censussubcommittee, announced that he and Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif,. areseeking to intervene in that suit in support of continuing to countaliens in the census. Excluding them can only be done throughConstitutional amendment, said Dymally.   The suit seeking to block the counting of aliens was brought byRep. Tom Petri, R-Wis., and a coalition of other congressmen andprivate groups.</TEXT></DOC>
