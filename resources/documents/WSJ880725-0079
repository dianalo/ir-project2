Cost control is also critical.    The point is aptly demonstrated in a case study of a coffee maker produced by Braun AG, the West German subsidiary of Gillette Inc. and a design leader.    The study was prepared by John Heskett, a visiting professor at the Harvard Business School and research director of the Triad Design Project, a joint venture of Harvard and the Design Management Institute in Boston. Triad is comparing design management in the U.S., Europe and Asia.    Braun entered the coffeemaker market in 1972 with a model that quickly won many design awards. But it was expensive to make. Its &quot;tower&quot; configuration required two heating elements: one at the top to boil water and another at the base to warm a carafe. Competitive coffee makers use a single heater.    Expensive materials and assembly methods also helped push Braun's cost to an uncompetitive level, and sales suffered.    A modified model didn't fare much better, and by 1981 the company decided to rethink the product. The new version has a single heating element and uses a less expensive plastic (which caused further design problems because when it cools after molding, it shrinks unevenly). The carafe handle is attached with glue instead of a metal band. Parts were minimized, and as many as possible were used in more than one model in the product range.    It took almost three years to bring the new model to production, but the effort seems to be paying off. The company cut its manufacturing cost by more than 50%. Production began in August 1984 at 2,000 units a day; by this April, production was up to 12,000 units a day.    But Can We Still   Splice the Main Brace? -   SAILBOATS ARE shedding traditional lines as manufacturers seek to attract first-time buyers with boats that are sleek-looking and easy to sail and maintain.    O'Day Corp. wanted a &quot;Euro look&quot; for its new 32-foot cruiser, the 322, so it hired an industrial design firm, Gunn Associates, Boston, to work with its naval architects, Hunt Associates, also of Boston. While Hunt designed the hull, basic layout and sail plan, Gunn added above-water detailing, such as tinted &quot;wraparound windows&quot; and beveled edges in the cockpit. Decks have been kept relatively clear of protruding hatches, vents and other clutter. Exterior colors are shades of gray, with not a stick of teak in sight. Accent colors are provided by the color-coded halyards and sheets. Below, a drop-away wall panel opens up the forward cabin in daytime, making the boat appear roomier than it is.    O'Day President Michael Dahill says the company has used Gunn for other boats, &quot;but they've never been in on it from the very beginning before.&quot;    Clear Directions   Aren't Accidental   THE DIRECTIONS must be designed as carefully as the product itself, more companies are finding.    For instance, Prodigy Services Co., a joint venture of International Business Machines Corp. and Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co., worked for three years to develop its system for shopping and retrieving information from a home computer over telephone lines. Much care was taken to make the operating procedures simple and the screen graphics clear.    But what about getting the thing running in the first place? Prodigy is aiming for a mass market, including the computer-shy. The company hired Smart Design, in New York, to package the product and &quot;get people from the store to the first screen,&quot; says Daniel Formosa, vice president.    Mr. Formosa says the first step was finding out exactly how the product worked and what a naive user would need to know. &quot;We learned that what people want most is just to be told in a simple, direct way what to do,&quot; he says. &quot;They don't want a lot of background or explanations or choices.&quot;    About 20 concepts were sketched, with three finalists tested with consumers and marketers. The resulting package includes an easel and a three-part folder that presents the material in the sequence it's used. Bright colors and bold graphics help keep the books unintimidating.    Odds and Ends   ROBOT UPDATE: Boeing Co. and Prab Command Inc. have jointly produced a voice-activated personal robot for quadriplegics. According to the designers, the robot can remove a single sheet of paper from a file, lift a dinner plate, open an oven door and turn the pages of a book, among other things. In other robot developments, engineers at Kubota Ltd., Osaka, Japan, told a conference in Minneapolis last week that they have built a prototype lawnmower that cuts the grass all by itself . . . Unauthorized use of computers, electric appliances and power tools can be prevented with Power Lock, distributed by St. James Industries, Santa Barbara, Calif. The device fits on the power cord and prevents it from being plugged into a wall outlet. . . . Window blinds with slats made of fabric are being marketed by Hunter Douglas Inc. The textured polyester slats are chemically treated to hold their shape. </TEXT></DOC>
