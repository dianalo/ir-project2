The document alsogives general guidance on the models used. Finally, specific values ofderived reference levels are given for radionuclides chosen for theirpotential importance in occupational exposure; these levels have beencalculated for intake by inhalation only since this is the most likelyroute of intake. The parameters used and the reference levels calculatedin this document are appropriate for occupationally exposed adults only.(UK).</TEXT></DOC>
