Ever since Iraqi troops stormed into Kuwait last August,telemarketing scams operated out of high-pressure &quot;boilerrooms&quot; have used the conflict to sell phony investments inoil-and-gas partnerships and, to a lesser extent, preciousmetals, too.</LP><TEXT>   Now's the time to invest in oil wells, goes the typicalsales script, since the Gulf war is certain to drive oilprices sky-high. Annual returns touted in sales calls rangeto as much as 85% or more.   &quot;The Michael Milkens and Drexel Burnhams of the world getthe big splashy headlines&quot; says John R. Perkins, president ofthe North American Securities Administrators Association, butit's in the boiler-room scams where &quot;the moms and pops arelosing their life savings.&quot; Mr. Perkins, who is alsoMissouri's commissioner of securities, says victims usuallyinvest between $5,000 to $10,000, but swindlers will seekwhatever they think the victim has. &quot;They don't lose a coupleof dollars a share, they lose everything they own.&quot;   To be sure, some of the pitches are genuine. ButCalifornia regulators, for example, in recent months havecome across some 100 bogus schemes that exploit the Mideastcrisis. &quot;In virtually 100% of the fraudulent oil and gasofferings, the Persian Gulf pitch is in there,&quot; says G.W.McDonald, assistant commissioner of California's Departmentof Corporations enforcement division.   He estimates the operators under investigation inCalifornia have bilked tens of thousands of investors acrossthe country to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars.   According to one script obtained by Californiaauthorities, sales people were claiming, &quot;In today's economy,only oil-and-gas investing brings you the surety and safetyof big returns due to the public awareness from the PersianGulf crisis. . . . Sheik Yamani says that oil will go above$60 per barrel within 60 days -- especially if war breaksout.&quot;   Of course, oil prices plummeted to $21 a barrel after theallied bombing began last month. And Ahmed Zaki Yamani, theformer Saudi oil minister, recently forecast that oil willfall to $12 a barrel or lower after the end of the war. Butthe initial jump into the $30s after Iraq invaded Kuwait lentcredibility to the claims.   Reports of oil-and-gas swindles rose sharply in Idahoafter August, and so far number about 50, says Wayne Klein,chief of the Idaho Securities Bureau. &quot;It's a great pitch forappealing to greed and profit motive,&quot; he says.   Texas also has its share of oil-and-gas schemes. The saleshooks of choice are new technologies, such as horizontaldrilling to extract hard-to-get oil from existing wells. Andthe money involved is Texas-sized: Telemarketing scammers areasking investors for -- and getting -- investments of$500,000 to $1 million, says John Morgan, director ofenforcement at the Texas Securities Board.   Con artists have used the crisis to pitch gold, silver andplatinum products, says Mr. McDonald, but depressed preciousmetals prices have limited the success of those scams.   State regulators and consumer groups began warning thepublic in August that fraudulent investment promoters wouldseize upon the Mideast crisis. After war broke out inJanuary, the National Consumers League in Washington issuedanother warning to watch out for rip-offs.   Missouri regulators were the first to make an arrest of apromoter using the Persian Gulf angle. Alan L. Lee, a Floridaattorney who represented himself as the president of apipeline company, told Missouri residents that after theIraqi invasion, he had been swamped with calls from gascompanies that wanted to use his Pennsylvania pipeline,Missouri regulators alleged. He offered stock in thenonexistent pipeline for $14,000 a share and promisedinvestors they would get their investments back in one year,they alleged.   Mr. Lee was arrested in August, but died of a heart attackbefore the case came to trial, says Mr. Perkins, the Missourisecurities commissioner. None of the victims' money wasrecovered.   It may be a while before other cases come to light. Ittakes most victims six months to a year to realize they havebeen had -- and even after figuring out what has happened,they often don't report it.   &quot;A lot of people feel like they should have known better,&quot;Mr. Perkins says. &quot;This isn't a crime where someone takes agun and holds it to your head. This is a crime that can beprevented by saying no.&quot;   California's Mr. McDonald adds that victims are usually ina different state than the boiler room, making it difficultfor investors to pursue legal action. And in many cases,victims can't justify paying legal costs to recover aninvestment under $10,000, he adds.   In any case, investors who do report such a fraud areoften too late. Telemarketing scams typically last for just afew months, then close down. By the time regulators find outabout it, there's no trace of the operation -- or theinvestors' money. &quot;That's always an advantage con artistshave, they can move more quickly,&quot; says Mr. McDonald.   For that reason, some states are taking active measures toget a jump on the offenders. Idaho regulators planted atelephone number on telephone and mailing lists favored byboiler rooms. Bureau staffers who answer the special phoneact interested in the deal, request materials and record theconversation. The line has received about 30 calls sellingoil-and-gas investments in the past six months, some usingthe Persian Gulf pitch, others touting horizontal drilling.This and other &quot;undercover&quot; methods give regulators a headstart on the investigation -- while the boiler rooms arestill running.   Idaho is usually a victim state, Mr. Klein of the IdahoSecurities Bureau says. The boiler-room operations themselvestend to congregate in sunny climes, such as California,Florida and Nevada. Southern California alone is the host tobetween 250 and 300 boiler rooms selling multiple deals, saysthe state's Mr. McDonald.   California officials have collected materials from about100 fraudulent oil-and-gas offerings, but it will be severalmonths before any actions can be brought. Complaints arerunning about 30 to 40 a month, Mr. McDonald says, but theregulators still don't have a large enough pool of victims tomake a case.   &quot;Clearly, it's a huge scam,&quot; says Mr. McDonald, &quot;but we'renot going to break it for another three to six months.&quot;   ---                 Fraud Fighter's Checklist                                                                                                          Investors can help protect themselves against fraudulentdeals by following these tips from the National ConsumersLeague's Alliance Against Fraud in Telemarketing.                                                                                                          -- Don't be pushed into a quick decision.                                                                                                          -- Request written information -- for yourself and foryour accountant, financial adviser, banker or attorney.                                                                                                          -- Check with state or federal regulatory agencies.                                                                                                          -- Ask what recourse you have if you aren't satisfied.                                                                                                          -- Don't make any investment you don't understand fully.                                                                                                          -- Refuse to provide personal financial information on thephone unless you're absolutely certain the caller isreputable.                                                                                                          -- Just hang up if you're uninterested, if you can't getstraight answers or you fear you may be making a seriousmistake.</TEXT></DOC>
