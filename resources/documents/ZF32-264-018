(Santa Clara, CA) has announced theICECap 486, a module that allows a 486 processor to run at 1.5 times itsnormal speed.andP;  A Peltier-effect thermoelectric cooler keeps the 486 chip atzero degrees C, which is claimed to allow a 35% speed increase.andP;  The other15% increase comes from tightly regulating the power supply voltage.andP;  Themodule also includes a heat sink, a fan, and a clock generator that startsthe chip at 33 MHz and gradually increases the clock rate as the chip coolsoff.andM;Since Intel specifies the 486 for operation over a wide temperature andvoltage range, it must specify the clock rate based on a worst-casecombination of these factors.andP;  The Velox module provides a best-casecombination of temperature and voltage.andM;the module allows 33-MHz chips to operate at 50 MHz.andP;  Since the on-chip cacheis sped up as well, the chip continues to operate at full speed on cachehits.andP;  When Intel is able to ship 50-MHz chips, the module will, in theory,allow operation at 75 MHz.andP;  It remains to be seen whether it will bepractical to build systems at this clock rate.andP;  System designers are on theirown when it comes to timing specifications; neither Intel nor Velox providestiming details for 486 behavior at the increased clock rate.andM;At $150 in OEM quantity, the ICECap 486 module is an inexpensive way to get asignificant performance boost.andP;  One drawback is power consumption.andP;  Theprototype modules dissipate about 30 W, including the 486 (which itselfnormally dissipates about 5 W).andP;  Velox expects to reduce the powerconsumption to about 20 W for the production version.andP;  The modules are alsobulky; the prototypes are about 4&quot; high, but the production version isexpected to be less than half that height.andP;  Production is planned for earlyin the fourth quarter.andM;Velox is working with several PC-compatible system vendors, and at least onesystem using the module is likely to appear at Comdex in November.andP;  UnlessIntel should decide to endorse the technology and provide timingspecifications for operation under the conditions produced by the module,however, large computer companies are likely to be wary.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
