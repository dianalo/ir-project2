 .  .&quot; message in yourtext.andP;  Word makes it easy to place the continued message so that your othertext will flow around it, and so that it will remain in the proper positioneven when you edit the surrounding text.andM;First, go to the page where the text will be continued and select some text,preferably a small amount-even a single word.andP;  Use the Format bookmark (FK)command to create a bookmark, and give it a name such as CONTI.andM;Then go to the page where you'll place the continued message.andP;  In a separateparagraph, type &quot;Continued on page page:cont1&quot;.andP;  The text after the colonshould be the name of the bookmark you created.andP;  Then press F3 (expandglossary).andP;  Word will put parentheses around &quot;page:cont1&quot; and will print thepage number of the bookmark when it prints the text.andP;  Next, with the cursorin the continued paragraph, give the Format position (FO) command and set thevertical frame position to Bottom.andP;  You may also set other positionparameters on this menu.andM;WORDPERFECTandM;Quick Copy and MoveandM;WordPerfect 5.1 adds a super-quick way of moving and copying text.andM;To move text, just block the portion you want to move and simultaneouslypress the Ctrl and Del keys.andP;  Position your cursor at the new position forthe text and press Enter.andP;  To copy text, just block the text and pressCtrl-Ins.andP;  Position the cursor where you want a copy, and press Enter.andP;  Thisworks only with the original keyboard layout.andM;Getting Date RightandM;Date/Outline (Shift-F5) options in WordPerfect 5.0 and 5.1 can wreak havoc.andO;Remember that when you select Date Code, the date in your document is updatedevery time you retrieve or print the document.andP;  If your writing needs to besaved with a historical date, be sure to use the Date Text option, whichstores the current date.andP;  If you're updating a document over a period of daysand you want it stored with the date of printing of the final draft, replacethe Date Code with Date Text before saving the final draft.andM;Another option is to write a macro to search and replace the Date Code withthe current date.andP;  Press Ctrl-F10 to start the definition, give the macro aname and an optional description, and then select F2 to search, Shift-F5 tosearch for Date, C for Date Code, and F2 again.andP;  Next, press the backspacekey to delete the Date Code, Shift-F5 for the Date feature, and choose T forDate Text.andP;  Last, press Ctrl-F10 again to turn off the macro recording.andP;  Thismacro will perform one search: if you need to change more than one date, runthe macro repeatedly to change all occurrences one by one.andM;LOTUS 1-2-3andM;Printer Select MacroandM;When you create spreadsheets in Lotus 1-2-3 that will be distributed to otherusers, you can make it easier for your colleagues to use their own printers.andO;Include a macro that will let them enter a setup string without wadingthrough 1-2-3's menus.andM;In this example, the macro begins in cell I21:andM;I      J      K      LandM;21     '/xIEnter setup string:[tilde] setup[tilde]andM;22     '/pposandM;23andM;24     '[tilde] qqandM;(Note the blank cell at I23.)andM;After the macro has been entered, place the cursor on cell I21 and type /Range Name Create \S.andP;  This will allow the macro to be invoked by pressingAlt-S.andP;  Then place the cursor on cell I23 and type / Range Name Create.andO;Supply the range name SETUP and press the Enter key.andM;When the macro is activated, the  Xl command will prompt the user, &quot;Entersetup string:,,.andP;  After the user enters a string and presses Enter, thestring will be stored in I23  SETUP).andM;Then the macro will execute the commands Print Printer Options Setup.andP;  Themacro fills in the string stored in I23, replacing any previous setup string,and then continues by executing Enter Quit Quit.andP;  At this point, the user isout of the menu system, ready to enter data or print the spreadsheet.andM;You can include the macro as an option on a menu rather than attaching it toan Alt-key sequence.andM;Hide Sensitive DataandM;Sometimes it's desirable to hide sensitive Lotus 1-2-3 data from prying eyes.andO;Suppose, for example, that you're working on a personnel file and don't wantpeople walking by to see the salaries paid to their coworkers.andP;  Once thesesalaries are entered, type / Worksheet Column Hide to remove the columncontaining them from view.andP;  Formulas based on data in the hidden column willstill function normally.andP;  Tandamp; redisplay the column containing these hiddensalaries, type / Worksheet Column Display.andM;MICROSOFTandM;Hardcopy HeadersandM;With Full Menus active, the Excel Options menu box displays a special item,Set Print Titles, to specify a header on the top of each page in a printout.andO;First, select the row(s) containing the text you want as your header.andP;  Thenselect Set Print Titles on the Options menu.andP;  The selected row(s) will printat the top of every page containing the cells found in that row.andM;Qandamp;AandM;Splitting a Field NameandM;Need to split an existing Qandamp;A database field-for example, a Name field thatcontains both first and last names? At the File menu, choose Design, thenRedesign.andP;  Create new fields called First Name and Last Name; make them textfields.andP;  At the File Menu, choose Mass Update.andP;  At the Retrieve Spec, pressF10 to select all records.andP;  At the Update Spec, enter the followingprogramming statements:andM;NAME: #1: #2 = @LEFT(#1, @INSTR(#1,&quot;,&quot;)andM;-1) ; #3 = @RIGHT(#1,andM;@INSTR(#1,&quot;,&quot;) +1)andM;FIRST NAME: #2andM;LAST NAME: #3andM;Press F10 to continue the mass update.andP;  When you're done, use Redesign againto delete the old Name field.andM;Print Multiple CopiesandM;Need to print multiple copies of a Qandamp;A report? The program has no menu choicethat lets you do that, but you can create a macro that does the job.andP;  Firstcreate a macro that prints one copy of a report.andP;  Then you can make Qandamp;Arepeat the report-printing macro several times by invoking it from a secondmacro.andP;  Let's assume you start your report-printing macro by pressing theAlt-R combination; to run two copies of the report, simply create a secondmacro that includes the two commands: Alt-R, Alt-R.andP;  For three copies, createa macro that invokes the Alt-R command three times, and so on.andM;REFLEXandM;Faster Data EntryandM;When several records you're entering into a Reflex 2 database have the samedata in different fields-such as state names in a mailing list-take advantageof either of two Reflex features to duplicate the data for you.andM;Create one record that contains the information you'll be duplicating.andP;  Thenuse the Generate Records dialog box (F10 RG) to create duplicate records.andO;Or, after creating the base record, switch to the List View (F10 VL), selectthe blank row beneath the existing record (move the cursor to it and pressF3), and press Ins once for each record you need.andP;  Then move the cursor tothe first blank row in the column beneath the field containing information,and enter a &quot; and press the down arrow key.andP;  The information will beduplicated in the current field.andP;  Repeat t s proc s for each field.andM;dBASEandM;Danger AreaandM;Users of DBASE IV should never change the names and orders of fields in thecatalog file structure.andP;  The program doesn't prevent users from modifying thestructure of a catalog file, but doing so can cause the loss of a record wi u warning.andP;  Hands off.andM;Pseudo-calculatedandM;Though DBASE doesn't have calculated fields, it's easy to make it act as ifit does.andP;  When entering a DBASE command, you aren't restricted to displayingactual fields.andP;  Your commands can also include an expression calculated fromyour database's fields.andP;  Say your database includes the names of items, theircosts, and their markup.andP;  The command LIST ITEM, COST, COST+(MARKUP*COST)will show the item, its cost to you, and its cost to the customer-even thoughthe cost to the customer is not a separate field in your database.andP;  You caneven use dBASE's trim and string functions to format textual informationnicely.andP;  &quot;Calculated&quot; fields such as TRIM(CITY)+&quot;,  &quot;+TRIM(STATE)+&quot; &quot;+ZIP andTRIM(FIRST)+&quot; &quot;+LAST will display attractive versions of your data.andM;DESQVIEWandM;More Available MemoryandM;Whenever you add a program to your DESQview environment, a 1,000-byte scriptbuffer is automatically set aside for that program.andP;  If you don't plan to usescripts with that program, eliminating this buffer reclaims about 1K of RAMfor additional applications.andM;To eliminate the script buffer, select the Change a Program option from theDESQview Open Window menu.andP;  After identifying the program you want to change,press Fl to access the Change a Program Advanced Options screen.andP;  Then pressTab until the cursor is positioned at the Script Buffer field.andP;  Change thedefault 1000 value to 0 and press Enter.andM;PARADOXandM;Query ShortcutandM;Instead of starting from scratch each time you need to build a query on atable in Paradox 3, you can use this handy shortcut: As long as the queryform you've just used is still in the workspace, it can be recycled.andP;  justalter the form so that it defines the new query, then press the Do-It! key.andM;PROCOMMandM;Control Line FeedsandM;Procomm's Alt-F3 key sequence provides a quick method for coordinating linefeeds and carriage returns during an online session.andM;If a remote system ends a line with a carriage return only, the next linetransmitted will overwrite that line on the screen.andP;  Pressing Alt-F3instructs Procomm to insert its own line feeds to separate message lines.andM;Conversely, a double-spaced message generally means that both the remotesystem and Procomm are inserting line feeds during transmission.andP;  Toeliminate the extra, blank lines, press Alt-F3, which will suspend Procomm'sline feed and reformat the message to single-line spacing.andM;PUBLISHER'S PAINTBRUSHandM;Save Files the Right WayandM;With Publisher's Paintbrush Version 1.52, do not attempt to save a file afteryou've edited it while  zoomed out,&quot; especially if you're overwriting it toan earlier file of the same name.andP;  The software will write a blank file todisk.andP;  To avoid this,  zoom in&quot; to the regular screen view and then save thefile.andM;FISRT PUBLISHERandM;Align Vertical TextandM;If you're having difficulty aligning text vertically in a proportional fontwhen creating First Publisher documents-particularly on a laser printer-keepin mind that you can use First Publisher's ability to generate amultiple-column publication to put elements other than body type in columns.andM;For example, if you're creating a table of contents and you'd like the pagenumbers to line up vertically along the right, start by creating a two-columnpublication.andP;  Then narrow the baselines in column two toward the right edgeof the page.andP;  Make sure this column is right-justified and that column one iscompletely filled with either text or carriage returns.andM;Next, stretch the baselines in column one to the right until they almosttouch column two.andP;  The result will be a tidy-looking table of contents withthe numbers lined up vertically along the right-hand edge of the page.andM;ALPHA WORKSandM;Store Letters as DataandM;You can store letters and other documents in AlphaWorks' database by usingmemo fields, a helpful technique to track correspondence by clients' databaserecords.andP;  Call up a record on a specific client, and your letters areavailable immediately.andM;Go into the memo field and create or retrieve the documents as if you were inthe Words service (F7, Retrieve).andP;  Then save the record.andM;You can also use the Block commands to cut and paste sections from otherservices into memo fields, and you can print the document directly from thememo field by using F7, Print.andM;PAGEMAKERandM;Uncommon FractionsandM;It's easy to write common fractions in PageMaker.andP;  To get 1/4, for example,you hold down the Alt key and tap out 0188 on the numeric keypad.andP;  But lesscommon fractions, such as 5/8, take a little more ingenuity.andM;You can print any fraction if you use different point sizes andsuperscripting.andP;  To get 5/8 when your body type is 10 points, for example,superscript the  5&quot; and make its size 8 points.andP;  Make the slash 10 pointswith a normal baseline.andP;  Make the  8&quot; 6 points, also with a normal baseline.andO;You must also kern the text to remove space between the slash and thenumbers.andP;  (Press Ctrl-backspace.) Depending on the typeface you're using, youmay have to adjust the sizes of the numbers.andP;  Usually, however, the slash winremain the size of your normal body type.andP;  With a little experimentation, youshould be able to get any fraction you need.andM;Do you have a secret about a faster, easier, or more creative way to use PCsoftware?
