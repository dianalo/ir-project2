Traders in Tokyo said some bargain-hunting in a relatively small number of issues, a fair share of them speculative, helped the market overcome a general lack of buying interest ahead of the U.S. Treasury's quarterly refunding beginning later Tuesday.    The Nikkei index rose 147.95 points to 27412.25. The market rebounded from a weak start that took the Nikkei down 97.38 points 14 minutes into the morning session.    In early trading on Wednesday, the Nikkei index added more than 77 points to 27489.31.    On Tuesday, the Tokyo Stock Exchange's first section index rose 5.30 to 2185.77. Volume on the first section was estimated at 700 million shares, up from 600 million shares Monday.    &quot;It was all black or white with most issues,&quot; said a fund manager at a Japanese life insurance company. &quot;Almost everything seemed to either move sharply or do nothing at all.&quot;    The fund manager said there were few incentives to buy stocks, especially since brokerage dealers were inactive. &quot;Dealers at most of the brokerages weren't moving,&quot; he said, &quot;and since it's been a dealer-led market recently, when that leadership is gone, very little happens.&quot;    He added that there was some renewed interest in companies with significant land holdings, such as Keisei Electric Railway, although real estate issues themselves were little changed.    He noted that another speculative issue, Kansai Kisen Kaisha, a ferry operator, was sharply higher, &quot;probably on a continuation of last year's speculation . . . about a buy-out.&quot; Kansai Kisen rose 29 yen, or 5%, to 613 yen ($4.90).    Keisei Electric, which closed at 964 yen, up 43, was also helped by rumors that Tokyo Disneyland posted record receipts during the holiday season just ended. Keisei indirectly holds a share in Tokyo Disneyland and operates a railway line that runs from central Tokyo to the area near the amusement park.    London share prices closed lower but at their best levels for the day in a late afternoon attempt to follow Wall Street higher.    The Financial Times 30-share index finished off 2.2 points at 1435.8. Volume was a moderate 397.5 million shares, compared with Monday's 360 million. The 100-share index ended 2.3 points lower at 1792.6.    The market opened sharply lower, then attempted to rally on news that the British government wouldn't launch a monopoly probe into the 18.2% stake held by General Cinema of the U.S. in food and drink giant Cadbury Schweppes.    Cadbury's share price, which has risen sharply in recent sessions in sympathy with Nestle's bid for Rowntree, another confectionery maker, finished 18 pence better at 336 ($6.30).    Cadbury also released a late afternoon statement saying that it was surprised and disappointed by the lack of opportunity to put forward its case against General Cinema's holding.    Dealers said other food issues were firmer on the Cadbury news. United Biscuits rose 5 to 279, and Rowntree gained 2 to 905.    By midafternoon, London shares attempted a comeback after several U.S. brokerages, including PaineWebber and Salomon Brothers, announced that they would suspend any non-customer related index arbitrage activity, effective immediately.    The market was hopeful that the suspension of stock index arbitrage might quell some volatility on world stock exchanges, traders said.    Share prices on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange were down in thin trading.    Brokers attributed the slump to lack of interest in the stock market and uncertainty over interest rates as bond prices dropped.    &quot;Nothing is going on these days,&quot; one broker at a U.S. bank in Frankfurt said. &quot;The rise in interest rates has scared off a lot of investors.&quot;    Even positive news from major German companies in the chemicals and pharmaceuticals sector couldn't bring the market out of its bearish mood, brokers said.    &quot;The market doesn't react to good news anymore,&quot; a London-based broker said.    Three chemical and pharmaceutical companies released positive earnings results Tuesday. BASF said its pretax group profit rose 7.5% in the first quarter. BASF shares, however, fell 3 marks to 236 ($140).    Schering AG was off 2.7 to 461.8 despite the company's announcement that its pretax group profit rose 24%.    Against the trend, Henkel shares gained 2.5 to 496.5 on news that the company would raise its dividend.    Among other chemical shares, Hoechst fell 1.2 to 251, and Bayer declined 4.2 to 253.5.    Meanwhile, share prices fell in Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam and Milan, closed mixed in Zurich and rose in Stockholm.    Paris had light trading, as concern about upward pressure on U.S. interest rates set off a round of profit-taking. Brokers said the main element was fear that pressure on interest rates in the U.S. and West Germany could spread to France and lead to a slowdown of economic activity.    Share prices closed higher in Manila and lower in Sydney, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taipei, Wellington and Seoul.    Sydney stocks fell amid sparse demand and as some brokerages engaged in index arbitrage program trading. Brokers said the disappointing performance of the New York market and the buoyancy of the Australian dollar added to already sagging sentiment.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva.
