For the age and risk groups in which the disease usually occurs, the effect may be devastating.    Populations exposed to AIDS risk factors such as intravenous drug use and promiscuity, whether homosexual or heterosexual, will feel the greatest impact. If we assume that the AIDS deaths predicted for 1991 are limited to the age group 25-54 years, the annual number of deaths for this group will increase from about 240,000 to 294,000, a rise of 23%. This is considerably greater than the 3% increase seen for all deaths in the U.S.    The Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report of Oct. 3, 1986, amplifies this point by comparing the cumulative incidence of AIDS in three towns in western Palm Beach County, Fla., which is 295 cases per 100,000 population, to the overall cumulative incidence in the U.S., which is 10.8 per 100,000. In Science (9/27/85) Curran, et al. examined &quot;years of potential life lost&quot; (YPLL), a measure of the impact of premature mortality, and reported that in the U.S. in 1984 among single men ages 25 to 44 AIDS increased the YPLL index by at least 5%. In Manhattan the index increased 43%, while in San Francisco the increase was 74%.    While Ms. Russell is technically correct, her use of national data obscures the fact that certain groups, distinguished by age, location and specific risk factors, will bear the brunt of this epidemic. This focused impact will undoubtedly have profound social effects and presents a tremendous challenge for insurance marketers and underwriters, self-insured employers, personnel managers, health-care providers and public-health officials.    G. Stewart Young   Manager, Applied Public Health Unit   Arthur D. Little Inc.   Cambridge, Mass.   ---   According to Maris A. Vinovskis, a professor of social history at the University of Michigan, the high point in teen-age pregnancy was reached in 1957. So much for the &quot;Virtuous '50s.&quot; The rate at that time was 97 babies born to girls between the ages 15 and 19 per 1,000 in the population. The rate in 1983 had dropped to 52 per 1,000. About half of these teen-agers married and many of the rest went on government support. The fact that half married does not speak to &quot;virtue&quot; as much as expediency, and perhaps accounts for the high rate of divorce among that cohort. One is also led to wonder about the kind of lives these women had with the burden of babies and little education.    The advent of legal abortion may have helped produce the more favorable recent numbers. In the past, teens were justifiably frightened of illegal abortion and were unsophisticated enough to be ignorant of contraception. It is likely that teens account for a higher percentage of abortions done today because mature women know more about contraceptive methods.    The overall rate of abortion is probably no higher today than before the Roe v. Wade decision. The difference is that women have stopped dying from the procedure. In Mexico they still are, and those with sufficient funds come to the U.S. for a safe procedure.    In any case, education must proceed apace on all counts. Surgeon General Koop's recommendations must be implemented with all possible speed. Parents must become involved in the sex education of their children. We cannot have one message in school and silence or a countermessage at home.    Charlotte Glauser   Board Member   Tri-County Planned Parenthood   Harrisburg, Pa.</TEXT></DOC>
