The lack of economic news and the meeting of the Group ofSeven industrial nations set for Saturday in Paris confinedthe greenback to tight trading ranges, dealers said. There islingering fear that the G-7 will surprise the market with aplan to defend the yen. G-7 nations include the U.S., Japan,Britain, West Germany, France, Italy and Canada.</LP><TEXT>   While most traders said the likelihood is slim that theG-7 will come up with measures to boost the yen, fewexpressed a willingness to sell the yen for dollars on theirexpectations.   Robert White, vice president and manager of corporatetrading at First Interstate of California, Los Angeles, saidnobody wants to buy the dollar now if the G-7 is going toknock it down next week with intervention. The reasoning:Intervention would give dealers a better rate at which to buydollars next week.   Traders showed more certainty about the mark'srelationship to the yen, nudging the West German currency toanother solid advance on confidence that the Bundesbank willsuccessfully manage the German monetary union while doubtspersist over Japanese monetary policy.   Speculation about results of the G-7 meeting also liftedthe mark against the yen. The West German currency gainedamid talk in the market that the U.S. and West Germany willrefuse to aid Japan in bolstering its currency, said JohnMcCarthy, chief foreign-exchange dealer atAmsterdam-Rotterdam Bank in New York.   Much of the greenback's gains against the yen came nearthe end of New York trading, with one dealer attributing thegains to another play in the mark-yen rate. Traders sold theyen not only against the mark but against the dollar.   Mr. White of First Interstate said the U.S. currency'sfall through a key chart point at 1.6980 marks in the NewYork morning set off more dollar selling. But there was nofollow-through, he said, adding that chartists' expectationsfor a break out of the ranges have generally been dashedrecently.   In late afternoon New York trading, the dollar was at1.6979 marks, down from 1.7009 marks late Monday, and at159.79 yen, up from 158.95 yen. Sterling was at $1.6357, upfrom $1.6348.   In Tokyo early Wednesday, the dollar was trading at 159.62yen, unchanged from the opening price but down from Tuesday'sTokyo close of 158.95 yen. Meanwhile, the U.S. currency wastrading at around 1.6968 marks, up slightly from the openingquote of 1.6965 marks but below Tuesday's Tokyo close of1.7008 marks.   The dollar isn't expected to top 160 yen or stray far from1.70 marks before the G-7 meeting. If nothing comes out ofthe meeting, the U.S. unit will quickly climb to 165 yen, Mr.White predicted.   Traders said a rebound by the Tokyo stock market Tuesdayand indications that the U.S.-Japanese trade talks inWashington are making progress helped the yen during the day.But other traders said the day's quiet trading was morebecause of caution following the dollar's recent jump againstthe yen.   Traders said the dollar should move between 157 and 160.50yen during the week. One trader, while contending that 165yen remains a long-term target, said the dollar should staybetween 155 yen to 160 yen for the next two to three weeks.   However, Katsumi Asako, chief corporate dealer withStandard Chartered Bank in Tokyo, said the dollar could stillmove as high as 162.50 yen if the stock market posts furthersharp declines.   Traders said the Bank of Japan is believed to have soldabout $100 million Tuesday. Some speculated that the Japanesecentral bank's intervention activities may be constrained bythe sharp drop in Japan's foreign reserves. The FinanceMinistry said Monday that Japan's foreign reserves postedtheir biggest monthly drop ever in March, falling $6.95billion. The Bank of Japan's heavy dollar sales during themonth are widely seen as the main factor behind the decline.   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for currentdelivery settled at $375.30 an ounce, up $5.50.   In Hong Kong Wednesday, gold opened for trading at $374.95an ounce.</TEXT></DOC>
