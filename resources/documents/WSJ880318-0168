Miller </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> PUB </IN><TEXT>   A WEEKEND IN a private villa at the new Coccoloba Plantation, perched on a picturesque beach on Anguilla in the British West Indies, costs $700. Costs you $700, that is. I have an invitation to unwind there for a few days for free.    It's a tempting offer, but it's hardly the best invitation on my desk right now. Some eager potential hosts in the Cayman Islands want to put me up for four days of free scuba diving and deep-sea fishing. The government of Ireland has invited me for a weeklong ramble along the shores of the River Shannon, and that comes with a free medieval banquet at Bunratty Castle.    Here's a nice one: Jet to Paris, spend the night at the Hotel George V, take a high-speed train to Geneva, spend a night at the Hotel des Bergues, and then jet back home -- all for free, of course. If I have any wanderlust left after that, I also have a standing invitation to visit the Budgetel Inn in Sheboygan, Wis., the home of the annual bratwurst festival. The hotel promises extra-long beds, free &quot;hot drinks,&quot; and free movies and sports on BudgeTelevision.    Delightful as all this personal attention may be, it's nothing personal. I'm just fodder for an old marketing ploy of the world's airlines, hotels and government tourist bureaus. They pour in journalists like me, and out come shiny new articles about the pleasures of travel.    The rationale for this practice is simple: Buying a full-page ad promoting a vacation spot costs many times more than buying me a ticket to go there and write a full-page article about the place. (That's certainly true of this Wall Street Journal Report, where a full-page ad cost $52,552. The Cayman Islands could send me deep-sea fishing for half a year for that money.)    Most newspapers and magazines are happy to play along. Weekly travel sections and monthly travel magazines can bring in streams of ad revenue. To charge top dollar, though, they need &quot;real&quot; articles alongside the ads, and few publications can afford to send enough writers around the world themselves.    In other words, the Coccoloba Plantation wins twice when it pays for journalists' junkets. The articles tout Coccoloba, and they give travel editors something to print, assuring the survival of advertising forums that Coccoloba and its parent company badly need. Few marketing investments are so efficient. Everybody benefits -- even readers.    Readers, that is, who read travel articles for the fun of dreaming about faraway island villas. Readers who believe that these travel articles provide much consumer information they can use on their own unsubsidized trips are another story. They're in danger of spending thousands of dollars to find out that real life isn't always as wonderful as junket life.    Of course, advertisers run the risk that journalists will come back from their junkets and fail to write the equivalent of ad copy. But any travel writer who dwelled too long on rude bellboys and food poisoning would throw the whole system out of whack. Most likely, many travel editors would stop buying the writer's pieces, and travel businesses would stop offering freebies. Editors won't say this out loud, but think about it: How often do you read about rude bellboys in your Sunday travel section? And how often do you read passages like these:   &quot;I am here to tell you about my very own dream boat. . . . We are drifting through upper Burgundy, in the heart of the Chablis country of eastern France, aboard the Fleur de Lys, which may very well be the most luxurious craft afloat . . . .&quot;    &quot;On silent nights, great flocks of white birds fly formations past the Camino's Lobby Bar. . . . and they have come to the right place. Ah, ah, Ixtapa!&quot;    &quot;There I was a few weeks ago, bugsnug in a two-floor room at the spiffy Lodge at Vail in Colorado. A fire crackled in the hearth; wine was cooling in the cooler. I thought I had found hotel heaven . . . .&quot;    These are selections from the writings of Horace Sutton, author of the syndicated column &quot;Of All Places,&quot; which runs in the Los Angeles Times, the Dallas Morning News and 20 other newspapers. Mr. Sutton has tens of thousands of junket miles behind him, and when I met him recently, he had just spent a busy week logging a few hundred more to Vieques, Puerto Rico.    Mr. Sutton is considered one of the deans of travel writing. Tourist countries no longer just offer him free trips -- they shower him gratefully with international honors. In recent years, the Bahamian government has inducted him into its Travel Writers' Hall of Fame, the Caribbean nations have awarded him the Marcia Vickery Wallace Award for Travel Journalism, and France has made him a chevalier of its Legion of Honor.    A weary look passed over Mr. Sutton's face when I asked him about conflicts of interest in travel journalism. &quot;I think anybody who's been reading me for 20 or 30 years should know me by now and know whether I'm an honest reporter,&quot; he said.    &quot;We're pros -- come on!&quot; Mr. Sutton added. &quot;Nobody really pays a hell of a lot of attention to 'do I owe him, does he owe me.'&quot; He holds special disdain for newspapers that sidestep junkets by having their bureau reporters around the world file travel stories. &quot;You can't say the foreign correspondent at the New York Times, who's a political reporter, knows what I do about the travel business,&quot; he says. &quot;Let me tell you something -- this is a hard job and it's a craft of its own.&quot;    Other practitioners view junkets in much the same way. &quot;I think sometimes the media is overconcerned with the ethics issue,&quot; says Mary Lu Abbott, the travel editor of the Houston Chronicle. &quot;We've got to trust ourselves. I am a reporter with certain values. When I became travel editor, I did not give up those values.&quot;    Every so often travel writers do turn around and criticize their hosts in print. But it's done very carefully. Shirley Slater and Harry Basch, a husband-and-wife team of syndicated columnists on cruise ships, are among the masters. A Slater-Basch column on cruise sanitation conditions races past the alarming statistic that about one in four ships fails Centers for Disease Control sanitation tests, and concludes:   &quot;Again, a ship that fails is not necessarily 'dirty' in the normal housekeeping sense. . . . We've come to one sure conclusion -- and we apologize to past dinner guests: Our kitchen would never pass.&quot;    Mr. Basch and Ms. Slater ended 1987 with a list of &quot;champagne and keelhaul awards&quot; for the industry. The champagne awards went to &quot;departing Costa President Howard Fine, who brought Cruising Italian Style into the mainstream,&quot; Cunard &quot;for maintaining the high quality aboard the Sea Goddess ships, contrary to what the nay-sayers thought would happen,&quot; and 11 others. Most of the keelhaul winners were tactfully left nameless: &quot;Those lines that tout a very low minimum cruise price but only have two or three cabins in that category,&quot; for example, and lines that don't &quot;enforce the nonsmoking areas on their ships.&quot;    Ms. Slater says that there were too many ships in these categories to name them all. &quot;I can understand the attitude that somebody's going to be kind to a cruise line because they have a free ticket,&quot; she says. &quot;But the people who do that aren't professional journalists -- they're flacks. If you do that and write about cruising as much as we do, you lose all your integrity, and you couldn't sell it. Editors would drop you like a hot potato.&quot;    The travel industry, on the other hand, is surprisingly candid about the quid pro quo it expects from writers. &quot;If someone goes over there and does a hatchet job, they better not come back to me again,&quot; says Morris Simoncelli, who hands out junket tickets for Japan Air Lines.    &quot;I have a little list,&quot; says Bruce Haxthausen, Mr. Simoncelli's counterpart at Air France. &quot;Inevitably, they're likely to approach us at a future date for cooperation again, and we have long memories around here. The computer helps us with that.&quot;    These are hard men to please. Don't take a ticket from Mr. Simoncelli and mention any carrier other than Japan Air Lines in your story. &quot;If they mention another airline at length, I'm very upset,&quot; he says. &quot;If they mention all the airlines equally, I'm still not particularly happy.&quot;    Mr. Haxthausen says that he explicitly asks writers who hit him up for tickets if they can &quot;give mention to Air France services, in a professional way. Not in a way that is a whitewash -- in a way that conveys useful information to the reader.&quot; Answer carefully, would-be junketeers. &quot;If we're not going to get any mention, then you might as well pay for your ticket on any carrier,&quot; Mr. Haxthausen says. &quot;We're not here to provide a charity.&quot;    In this game, the usual rule is the bigger the publication, the better the junket treatment. Says Madeline Cohen, a freeroom dispenser at Hilton International, &quot;If someone comes along to do a local travel piece for a local paper with a circulation of 30,000, we'll give them a nice room and probably the manager will invite them for drinks. But it won't be the same thing as a national publication that will have lots of readers who are our customers.&quot;    That rule would be great news for me, but The Wall Street Journal is one of a handful of publications that forbid writers to accept industry junkets. The others include the Washington Post and the New York Times. Some papers, like the Los Angeles Times and the Dallas Morning News, apply that ban to their own staff members but sometimes buy junket reports from free-lancers or syndicated writers.    A glossy new magazine called Conde Nast's Traveler made its debut last fall with the ringing promise that it too would forswear junkets and deliver &quot;truth in travel.&quot; Some travel writers were surprised when its November cover -- package on the Caribbean featured a list of &quot;30 great beaches&quot; by regional correspondent Margaret Zellers. Ms. Zellers also wrote the text for a 36-page ad insert promoting the Caribbean that ran in the same month's New Yorker.    Asked whether she sees a conflict in offering readers consumer ratings and writing ads for the same products, Ms. Zellers says: &quot;It's common knowledge to everyone who knows me that I love the area and care about it, so I'm not going to spend a lot of time writing about how terrible it is.&quot;    Nevertheless, at Traveler's insistence, the New Yorker &quot;advertorial&quot; ran without her byline. &quot;I objected to her name being on it,&quot; says Harold Evans, the magazine's editor. &quot;I felt it would confuse people.&quot;    If readers are alert, they can often find out what they need to know anyway. When Horace Sutton came back from Vieques, he told his readers that he had to wait six hours and then tiptoe around horse manure to reach his hotel room at the Esperanza settlement. When he opened the door, the floor was dirty and there were no light bulbs, soap or clean linens. Dinner on Vieques was a Chinese buffet featuring &quot;Very Lo Mein,&quot; &quot;Mao Tze Tongue&quot; and &quot;semi-live music.&quot;    Still, Mr. Sutton pronounced the island &quot;an idyllic corner of yesterday&quot; with &quot;some of the most incredible beaches on any tract of real estate anywhere in the world.&quot; He closed his column: &quot;. . . looking back on those incredible beaches and considering the developers' itch to develop, it can't last long. Go.&quot;    ---   Mr. Miller is a staff reporter in The Wall Street Journal's New York bureau. </TEXT></DOC>
