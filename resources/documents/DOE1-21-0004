The study quantified potential gas lossthrough migration from the Naval Oil Shale Resere (NOSR) No. 3 to nearbyproducing wells located in the Rulison field and forecasted productionfor proposed NOSR No. 3 offset wells located at previously selected sites,offsetting commercial wells outside the reserve. After the reservoirswhere characterized, production was forecasted by use of a reservoirsimulator to history match actual production. A dual-porosity reservoirsimulator, developed specifically for naturally fractured gas-producingreservoirs, and reservoir engineering calculations were used in the study.The study followed two extensive DOE field testing programs, a nearbymultiwell experiment (MWX), and a special Mesaverde test well (1XM9)drilled in NOSR No. 3. These DOE field tests provided geologic informationand values for reservoir parameters that control production from thisunconventional gas resource. In addition to the results from the twofield experiments, the study used a detailed geologic analysis and productiondata from nearby industry wells to characterize the producing formations.</TEXT></DOC>
