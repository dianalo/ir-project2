The step should help Cadam's sales while making it easier forengineers to work together on designs even if they use differentmodels of computers, said Eric Keller, senior research analyst atGartner Group in Stamford, Conn.   Cadam Professional software is for designing objects ranging fromcars to printed circuit boards.   Cadam said a feature called Power Link will make it easy fordesigns that are developed on a Sun workstation to be moved to anApollo workstation, and vice versa.   General Motors Corp. demanded that exchangeability in 1987 whenit authorized Cadam as one of its two suppliers of computer-aideddesign software, along with McDonnell Douglas Corp.   Eventually other computers, including International BusinessMachines Corp.'s RT-PC, will be included in Power Link, Cadam said.The RT-PC was the first workstation to run Cadam Professional. Cadamalso makes design software that runs on mainframes and personalcomputers.</TEXT></DOC>
