Thisis done by reverse osmosis using a thin-film composite membrane comprisinggamma-irradiated sulfonated poly(2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene) oxide (SPPO).The invention is broadly applicable to the treatment of any waste waterstream containing organic chemical and dissolved minerals contamination,using any high energy irradiated thin-film composite SPPO membrane.</TEXT></DOC>
