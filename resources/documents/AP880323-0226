The sources said one question still open was whether the currentAfghan government or another would oversee implementation of thedeal. The other is the future of aid to Afghanistan from the SovietUnion, which now has an estimated 115,000 soldiers in the countryhelping fight Moslem insurgents.   Moscow and its Communist allies in Kabul say both issues areoutside the scope of the Geneva talks and raising them with a thirdcountry _ Pakistan in this case _ would constitute interference inAfghanistan's internal affairs.   Diego Cordovez, the U.N. mediator, was said to be confident athird problem could be resolved by compromise language. Thatproblem arose last week when Abdul Wakil, the Afghan foreignminister, accused Pakistan at a news conference of creating new``complications'' by reviving an old border dispute.   It concerns the Durand Line, a boundary between Afghanistan andBritish India agreed upon in 1893. It was accepted by Pakistanafter independence in 1947, but Afghanistan claimed an area southof the line.   Pakistan's chief negotiator in Geneva, acting Foreign MinisterZain Noorani, told reporters on the same day Wakil made hisallegations that his delegation ``never raised any question as tothe Pakistani-Afghan border.''   He said the border was a ``non-issue'' and Pakistan accepts thepassage in the agreements requiring the parties ``to refrain fromviolations of the existing internationally recognized boundarybetween the two countries.''   Pakistan acts as spokesman for the Afghan guerrillas.</TEXT></DOC>
