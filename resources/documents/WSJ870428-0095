Lotus said the product -- called 1-2-3/M -- is the first of a series of products to be developed and marketed jointly with IBM under an agreement signed yesterday. The product won't be available until early 1988. Lotus also said at its annual meeting here that it plans to work with IBM on personal-computer database, or record-keeping, software.    The agreement is likely to fortify Lotus's already strong position in the software business and help it prepare for growing competition from its cross-country rival, Microsoft Corp. of Redmond, Wash. &quot;Until today, the only personal-computer software vendor that had a public development and marketing relationship with IBM was Microsoft -- and that has been reflected in Microsoft's stock price,&quot; said David Readerman of Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co.    &quot;We're ecstatic,&quot; said Jim P. Manzi, chairman and president of Cambridge, Mass.-based Lotus. Although IBM and Lotus had been talking for months, their agreement wasn't signed until early yesterday, just hours before the Lotus meeting. Terms weren't disclosed.    Depending on the price of 1-2-3/M, which wasn't disclosed, some Lotus customers may choose to run 1-2-3 on their mainframes instead of buying separate copies for each personal computer. But analysts said they didn't expect that to put a dent in sales of the personal-computer version. Lotus said the mainframe software will allow companies to easily consolidate personal-computer spreadsheets into a master spreadsheet on the mainframe.    Mr. Manzi said the pact won't prevent Lotus from rewriting 1-2-3 for other large computers, such as those made by Digital Equipment Corp. The mainframe version of 1-2-3 will run on the new IBM 9370 minicomputer that is part of IBM's attempt to recapture market share from Digital. A Digital spokesman hadn't any immediate reaction.    At its annual meeting, Lotus also said it is developing personal-computer database software with help from outsiders, but declined to identify them. Lotus, which gets the bulk of its revenue from spreadsheets and related products, had been expected to enter the database market, which is now dominated by Ashton-Tate of Torrance, Calif. The Lotus database product will use the new OS/2 operating system developed by IBM and Microsoft, and will be designed for simultaneous use by several people, Lotus said.    Roy Folk, executive vice president of Ashton-Tate, said he didn't see anything in Lotus's &quot;pretty vague set of announcements&quot; that presents any threat to Ashton-Tate's database products or strategy to develop products both for existing computers and the new IBM machines. He called the IBM-Lotus pact &quot;a public relations coup for Lotus.&quot; He wouldn't say if Ashton-Tate has talked about a similar arrangement with IBM.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Lotus shares rose $2.50 to close at $28.50; Microsoft closed at $99, unchanged; and Ashton-Tate fell $1.75 to close at $21.    In addition, Lotus also said that it is developing two new versions of 1-2-3, the best-selling software for personal computers. One will be an enhanced version of the currently available 1-2-3, will run on existing personal computers and will be ready early next year. The other, called 12-3/G, will use the graphics features developed by Microsoft and IBM for the new operating system. Mr. Manzi said that the two versions of 1-2-3 are &quot;explicitly designed to work side-by-side in the workplace,&quot; and that users will be able to move data from one to another.    Lotus didn't give prices for any of the products. It said the database and 1-2-3/G products will be available only after IBM releases the graphics portion of its new operating system. IBM hasn't set a date for that yet.    Separately, Mitchell D. Kapor, founder and former chairman of Lotus, didn't stand for reelection to the company's board. He remains a consultant to the company and is developing new products that haven't yet been announced. Mr. Kapor resigned as chairman last July. </TEXT></DOC>
