A congressional source told The Associated Press the FBIbelieves Felix S. Bloch was recruited by the KGB, the Sovietintelligence service, while he was serving at the U.S. Embassy inEast Berlin 14 years ago.   The New York Times today quoted an unnamed official as sayingBloch admitted receiving money for spying. It said he made theadmission during his only interview with the FBI on June 22, theday he was placed on administrative leave from his State Departmentjob.   Bloch has not been charged with any crime but remains underheavy FBI surveillance.   President Bush told reporters today ``I can't give you thefacts'' on the case while it is under investigation. But he addedhe was ``very concerned out premature discussion and disclosure _that means leaks _ on this matter, because I think you canjeopardize the case itself and perhaps the man's ability to get afair hearing.''   Officials in Washington disclosed Thursday that Bloch receivedState Department merit raises of more than $13,000 while he was theNo. 2 officer in the American embassy in Vienna.   The raises are given to diplomats whose work is ``well aboveaverage,'' said a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity.   During the FBI interview, the Times said, Bloch refused todiscuss his motives for spying or give details on his activities.But it said he admitted spying for the Soviets ``for many years''and told the FBI that they ``paid me a lot of money.''   Three administration sources familiar with the Bloch case saidin Washington Thursday night that they had not been told of suchadmissions.   The Times said the FBI had received information that promptedmajor interest in a recent trip Bloch was making to Europe andplanned a surveillance operation.   The agency notified foreign intelligence services andcongressional committees, and somehow the information got out, thepaper said. As previously reported, U.S. eavesdropping picked up aSoviet agent telling Bloch, ``A bad virus is going around and webelieve you are now infected.''   The FBI also got permission to search his home but found nothingincriminating, the paper said.   Government sources say Bloch was videotaped in Paris handing abriefcase to a Soviet agent earlier this year. The contents of thebriefcase remain unknown.   The Austrian government's top police official said today that asuspected KGB agent who may have been a contact man for Blochtraveled to Vienna several times in the past 10 years on falseFinnish papers.   Robert Danzinger told reporters that Austrian authorities weretold by U.S. officials on June 23 about a suspected KGB agent whoallegedly had contacts with Bloch.   ``We assume he worked for the KGB,'' Danzinger said. ``We haveno information of our own that he is KGB. That information camesolely from Washington.''   Austrian Interior Minister Franz Loeschnak confirmed newsreports that Bloch had a ``friendship'' with an Austrian woman overa period of several years.   The woman, a Vienna resident, returned from a vacation in Egyptand was questioned by Austrian authorities this week, Danzingersaid, but this yielded no evidence she suspected anything aboutBloch.   In Moscow, Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimovdenied any Soviet connection with Bloch. Gerasimov said Thursday hemade inquiries about Bloch's activities. ``The name of Bloch wasnot familiar. We have no connection with him,'' he said.   Bloch's merit raises included an increase of $4,500 for fiscal1983-84, $4,000 for 1984-85 and $4,800 for 1985-86, said anofficial who spoke on condition of anonymity.   But Bloch's raise was the lowest of three merit pay grades inthe Senior Foreign Service, with the highest reaching about $9,000a year, the official said.   The pay increases were given to Bloch while he was in Vienna,where he was posted from 1980 to 1987. Former U.S. ambassador toAustria Helene Von Damm, who has been publicly critical of Bloch,was among those who recommended the raises, said the official.   After 30 years with the State Department, Bloch reached one ofthe most senior gradings in the foreign service and makes about$80,000 annually, officials said.   Merit raises in the Senior Foreign Service are sometimes givento diplomats who are eligible for more senior postings but cannotget them because of a shortage of vacant slots.   Bloch continues to draw his paycheck and benefits, although hisdiplomatic passport and credentials have been revoked, thedepartment says.   Bloch has been under tight FBI surveillance for several weeks.Agents followed him Thursday as he ended a three-night stay at hisfather's East Side co-op in New York City and returned by car tohis daughter's house in Chappaqua, N.Y., north of the city.   Agents are engaged in what is expected to be a lengthy searchfor the specific evidencethat would be required to charge Blochunder the Espionage Act, including what secrets, if any, werecompromised.   An FBI team has arrived in Vienna to assist in the investigationthere, according to Friday's editions of the Neue Kronen Zeitung.FBI spokesmen in Washington would not confirm that.   Meanwhile, President Bush added his voice to those advocatingimproved U.S. counterintelligence efforts.   ``The question is: Can we improve our counterintelligence? Wealways ought to be striving to do that. Can embassy security beimproved? We go through this periodically and the answer is, I'msure it can,'' Bush told reporters Thursday.</TEXT></DOC>
