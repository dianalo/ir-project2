Noriega did not attend the brief ceremony at which hisschoolmate, Francisco Rodriguez, was sworn in as Panama's sixthpresident in six years.   Later, in a televised speech Friday night, Rodriguez appealed tothe United States to end its confrontation with Panama.   President Bush said in Washington earlier Friday that he wouldtighten sanctions ``to deprive the illegal regime of funds thatbelong to the Panamanian people.''   ``I am confident that other governments which support humanrights, democracy and self-determination and which oppose drugtrafficking will take similar measures,'' he said.   U.S. officials in Panama said the tighter sanctions would try tokeep Noriega and his associates from doing business with U.S.companies.   Noriega is under indictment for drug trafficking in the UnitedStates, which says he is a key connection for Colombia's cocainecartels.   ``The fact that Gen. Noriega handpicked another president doesn'tchange the political situation of the country,'' opposition leaderGuillermo Endara said through a spokesman.   ``The corruption will continue. The dictatorship will continue.Nothing will change. Things will change when democracy is restoredin this country.''   Rodriguez, a career bureaucrat who has served Noriega for 20years, donned the presidential sash in a 20-minute televisedceremony. The ceremony was closed to the public and press, and thediplomatic corps was not invited.   The Council of State on Thursday designated Rodriguez, 50, aspresident and Carlos Ozores Typaldos, a 49-year-old jurist, as vicepresident.   Supreme Court President Marisol Reyes de Vasquez administered theoath of office to both.   Rodriguez spoke for about four minutes, quoting poet KhalilGibran and promising to ``carry out my work with love, with love ofmy country, with energy and, above all, with dedication to serve thebest interests'' of Panama.   At a news conference afterward, he defended the legality of theprovisional government, calling it ``a product of the best politicaloptions after the dialogue with the opposition was interrupted.''   Rodriguez later appealed in a nationally televised speech for anend to the face-off between Panama and the United States.   ``In this transition phase, the United States has a magnificentopportunity to show the world its sincere concern for establishing asolid democracy in Panama by letting Panamanians decide forthemselves,'' he said.   Rodriguez did not mention new elections in his 30-minute speech.   In an interview, Ricardo Arias Calderon of the oppositionChristian Democratic Party called the swearing-in ``equivalent to acoup d'etat carried out in order to place the country completelyoutside any constitutional government, and thus assure thecontinuation in power of General Noriega.''   Asked if the opposition planned any demonstrations, he said:``Under present circumstances that is not feasible. We have hadsince May over 200 people imprisoned.''   Rodriguez was appointed to fill the constitutional void createdwhen the Noriega-controlled government annulled the May 7 generalelection.   The opposition later refused Noriega's invitation to join ajunta, saying it would continue to press for recognition of its May7 victory and Noriega's departure from power.   International observers of the election said the opposition wonby about a 3-1 margin. The government said it was annulling theelection because of alleged U.S. interference.   Rodriguez asked for international support in what he calledPanama's attempt to achieve a democracy in the face of U.S.aggression.   He is the sixth person to don the presidential sash since Noriegabecame commander of the Defense Forces in 1983, succeeding the lateGen. Omar Torrijos as Panama's military strongman.   Only one, Nicolas Ardito Barletta, was elected. He was forced toresign in 1986.   Panama's Council of State said the provisional government willconsider calling new elections in six months if the United Statesreleases Panamanian funds frozen in U.S. banks, lifts economicsanctions and ends what it termed ``U.S. aggression.''   The freeze was imposed after Noriega's indictment last year aspart of U.S. support of the opposition campaign to force the generalto resign.   Noriega says the campaign against him is a thinly veiled plot byU.S. rightists to renege on the 1977 treaties. Under the treaties,Panama is to take full control of the Panama Canal at the end of thecentury.   Bush said Friday the United States ``will not have any diplomaticcontact with the Noriega regime.''   He said that ``the candidates chosen by the Panamanian peoplewill not be allowed to take office today, as required by thePanamanian Constitution. Panama is therefore, as of this date,without any legitimate government.''   Bush's decison will have little practical impact. The U.S.Embassy remains open and officials said there were no plans to closeit down.</TEXT></DOC>
