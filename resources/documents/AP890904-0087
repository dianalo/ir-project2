But some doubt whether the conservative and fiercelyanti-communist Republican will fit in with the other Hispanicmembers of Congress _ mostly liberal Democrats _ in buildinginfluence for the nation's 20 million-plus Hispanic-Americans.   ``The Hispanic caucus is social issues-oriented and I thinkshe'll have difficulty with her views,'' said Alfredo Duran, aCuban-born lawyer and former state Democratic chairman.   Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, 37, was elected a week ago to the House seatheld for 27 years by Democrat Claude Pepper before his death May 30.She was elected almost solely on Hispanic, mostly Cuban-American,votes after a campaign in which she accused Democrat Gerald Richmanof bigotry for his claim that he was running for ``an Americanseat.''   Ms. Ros-Lehtinen will become the 12th member of the Hispaniccaucus, which is dominated by representatives of Mexican-Americanand Puerto Rican descent. She will be the only Hispanic Republicanwith a vote in Congress.   Marguerita Roque, staff director of the Hispanic caucus, said inWashington that the caucus has focused in recent years on suchissues as bilingual education, immigration, health care, gettingundocumented aliens counted in the federal census and minoritybusiness development.   She said the caucus, which also has 58 associate members who arenon-Hispanic, also has become more involved in U.S. foreign policy,particularly in Central America.   Cuban-Americans, leaving a communist homeland, have tended toemphasize foreign policy and distrust of big government and taxes.The average income and employment of the more than 1 millionCuban-Americans are higher than that of other Hispanic minoritygroups.   ``Definitely, the Cubans are much more conservative than the restof the Hispanic community,'' said Duran.   Ms. Ros-Lehtinen said during her campaign that she believes shecan explain the communist threat to other members of the Hispaniccaucus. She said her background as an educator should help as shetries to work with Hispanics on issues of common ground.   Some Cuban-American leaders say Ms. Ros-Lehtinen's viewsrepresent older Cuban exile attitudes and not those of young Cubans.   Mayor Xavier Suarez, an independent elected in 1985 as the firstCuban-American in that job, said Ms. Ros-Lehtinen will make the Bushadministration more sensitive to Hispanic concerns and can explaincommunist Cuba ``without being fanatical about it.''   Duran said Ms. Ros-Lehtinen may help bring younger Cubans to theDemocrats.   ``Just wait until Ileana starts casting her votes in Congress,''Duran said.</TEXT></DOC>
