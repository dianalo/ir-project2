Similar advances in analyzing human skin cancershave not been possible, as DNAs of most skin cancers or skin cancer celllines - including most malignant melanomas - do not transform 3T3s. Theauthors have developed a DNA transfection system using human cells asrecipients: normal human cells are transformed to anchorage-independentgrowth by transfection with a variety of skin cancer DNAs. This methodmay allow identification of the genes and specific altered in sunlight-inducedhuman skin cancers. 12 references, 2 figures, 1 table.</TEXT></DOC>
