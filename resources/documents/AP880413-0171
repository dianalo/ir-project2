Mothers in the two groups reported essentially equal levels ofsatisfaction with self and life, and said they were generally happywith their decision about the baby, the study found.   Researchers cautioned the results would apply only to teen-agemothers who participate in a pregnancy-counseling program similarto one used by the 269 mothers in the study.   In addition, ``it would be wrong to conclude that it is easy foradolescents to relinquish their children,'' wrote StevenMcLaughlin, Diane Manninen and Linda Winges of Battelle's Healthand Population Research Center in Seattle.   The federally financed study appears in the current issue ofFamily Planning Perspectives.   It includes 123 mothers who reared their children and 146 whochose adoption. All gave birth to their first child as an unmarriedteen-ager, and participated in a pregnancy counseling programaffiliated with a large adoption agency that permits communicationbetween biological and adoptive parents.   They filled out a questionnaire six months to seven years afterthe birth. Researchers considered differences in elapsed time whencomparing the groups.   Both groups reported moderately positive levels ofself-satisfaction. They did not differ significantly inlife-satisfaction. Child rearers were more likely to call theirlives difficult.   On a five-point scale to measure satisfaction with theirdecision to relinquish or keep the baby, relinquishers averaged4.35, less satisfied than the 4.69 reported by those who kept theirbabies. But both scores are high and the difference ``should beinterpreted with some caution,'' researchers wrote.   For one thing, adolescents who chose to rear their children willprobably not report regrets because it might be interpreted as notloving the child, researchers wrote.</TEXT></DOC>
