What's a health-conscious consumer to do?   Frank E. Young, who heads the federal agency that regulates thelabels on much of our food, can sympathize. He's a doctor, and evenhe has trouble.   It's hard ``to read labels and figure out what to eat,'' saidYoung, commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, whichis responsible for labels on foods not regulated by the U.S.Department of Agriculture.   Statements on food packages by law must be true, but may nottell consumers all they want to know.   ``Saturated fat is still not listed, cholesterol is still notlisted, and fiber is still not listed... These are the nutrientsthe surgeon general has told the American public to watch for whenthey go shopping,'' said Bruce Silverglade of the Center forScience in the Public Interest.   Food processors say the problem is that many consumers aren'tsufficiently informed about ingredients to interpret informationalready on labels.   The FDA was sidetracked from food label reform by such issues asAIDS and food additives, he said. But labeling will be a dominantissue this year, and the agency is considering new regulations onfiber and cholesterol.   Silverglade agreed that prospects for reform are better, becauseof reports advising Americans to modify their diet, and because ofconsumer frustration.   Still, Young said, it likely will be years before consumers seechanges.   There are two issues the FDA must consider: nutrition labels,listing ingredients in descending order by weight, and per-servingamounts of calories, protein, and certain vitamins and minerals;and health claim labels.   ``Health claims are claims that talk about the people that eatthe food. Nutrition claims are claims that are made about theproperties of the food,'' said Professor John L. Stanton at St.Josephs University in Philadelphia.   ``We really need a strategy that includes both of them,'' Youngsaid. An FDA proposal awaiting Office of Management and Budgetapproval would regulate health claims. It would address fats andheart disease, fats and cancer, fiber and cancer, calcium andosteoporosis, and sodium and hypertension. The FDA would come upwith model label statements that manufacturers could use, orcompanies could write their own within certain guidelines.</TEXT><HEAD>What the Patient Doesn't Say Can Be Very Important</HEAD><DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Physicians need to ``listen'' with theireyes, according to a doctor who believes patients sometimes say``yes'' while their bodies are really saying ``no, no, no'' totreatment.   The doctor who understands that body language can deal with theconflict and try to help instead of sending the patients awayunhappy, said Dr. Cecile Carson, chief of behavioral andpsychosocial medicine at Genesee Hospital.   ``It's not what we say, but how we say it and how a patienthears it, that makes a difference,'' agreed Dr. Robert E. McAfee ofPortland, Me., a member of the American Medical Association Boardof Trustees. ``It goes to the question of who you want for yourdoctor. If you come to me and keep coming back to me, it's probablybecause I, quote, tend to hit off with you, unquote.''   Carson, supported by a grant from the National Fund for MedicalEducation, has adapted non-verbal communication theories _ shrugs,folded arms and glances _ and is teaching medical students andlecturing around the country.   She also emphasizes ``pacing'' _ adjusting body movements to apatient's movements in order to make a patient feel morecomfortable. ``So if a patient has her arms crossed, the doctormight want to cross his arms. If the patient is leaning forward,the doctor might want to lean forward.''   Carson believes that non-verbal communication is a skill thatcan be acquired with practice, and that even people who recognizeand respond to many non-verbal actions need to be taught.   Generally, when the doctor-patient interaction falls apart, shesaid, the first the doctors say is that they've got a hostile or anuncooperative patient on their hands. ``They don't ask if there'ssomething they can do.''</TEXT><HEAD>Hobbyist's Radar Provides Early Warnings In Tornado Season</HEAD><DATELINE>CORSICANA, Texas (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   When towering thunderstorms threaten,Lloyd Huffman fires up the Doppler radar he built from militarysurplus parts.   Unlike conventional radar, Doppler can detect the speed anddirection of raindrops within a storm, allowing Huffman to spotrotation that could indicate the formation of a tornado and warnthe weather service and local authorities.   ``It just kind of grew over the years,'' Huffman said of theradar he's been tuning up in anticipation of the April-through-Junetornado season.   With a few differences _ cost being a big one _ Huffman's S-bandDoppler is like the NEXRAD system being tested at the NationalSevere Storms Laboratory in Norman, Okla., and planned fornationwide installation in the coming decade.   Huffman and his crew staff the station when severe weather ispossible.   The radar can detect rain intensity for several hundred miles,but can only process Doppler information for about 150 miles. Theradar pulses about 1,000 times a second, sending a beam about 1{degrees wide. The reflected data is sorted into ``range bins'' each150 meters deep.   The computer assigns a color to each velocity _ red indicatesmovement toward the station, green is away _ painting a picture ofthe storm. The right combination of colors on the southwest cornerof a storm indicates rotation.   If Huffman detects the formation of a cylinder that could mean atornado, he contacts the National Weather Service and localauthorities.   NEXRAD _ costing millions as opposed to Huffman's $50,000 since1976 _ will differ by having built-in programs to compare data withregional models and issue an automatic warning of tornadolikelihood.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for April 6</NOTE></DOC>
