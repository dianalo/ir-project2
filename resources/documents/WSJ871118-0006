A closure could make it difficult for the company to pay more than 800 million dollars of debt. The coal mine, one of the world's largest, is the sole security for nearly all the debt.    Paul Kostiuk, Quintette's president, said in a statement that a consortium of nine Japanese steel mills that buys coal from the mine asked for a price reduction to 57.85 dollars a metric ton from 95 dollars, a request he rejected as &quot;unconscionable.&quot;    The statement said discussions are at an impasse and that the consortium wants the issue settled by a British Columbia arbitration panel. Mr. Kostiuk couldn't be reached for comment on Quintette's position on arbitration.    The mine was opened in 1983 to supply about five million metric tons of coal a year to the Japanese steel companies until 1998. To support the project and a smaller mine nearby, the governments of Canada and British Columbia spent 1.2 billion dollars on a railway, ocean terminal and other infrastructure.    A Quintette spokesman said about 6,000 to 7,000 workers would be idled by a shutdown, including 1,500 employed directly by Quintette. The rest are involved in transporting the coal or supplying the mine.    Toronto-based Denison Mines Ltd. which has a 50% stake in Quintette, wrote off its entire $240.7 million investment last year. The other 50% is held by several French and Japanese concerns, including a 10% stake held by the Japanese steel companies. </TEXT></DOC>
