 400 on Reader Service CardandM;European accounting software vendors have have discovered the U.S.andP;  market.andO;An increasing number of European companies have recognized that largeAmerican corporations need powerful accounting software and are willing topay top dollar to get it.andM;For their part, American companies are showing a growing eageness toassimilate the international accounting capabilities that European packagesoffer.andP;  Some American accounting software vendors have added multicurrencyfeatures to their packages, but their European counterparts have beenoffering such capabilities for years.andP;  Without these features, U.S.andO;accounting software vendors may find it difficult to compete in theinternational area.andM;Pursuing its piece of the American dream, Coda Ltd. of England opened itsAmerican division Coda Inc., in Manchester, N.H., in 1988.andP;  Targeting theFortune 500--including companies with annual revenues ranging.andP;  from hundredsof millions to billions of dollars--Coda offers its Integrated AccountingSystem (IAS), a package whose strengths include links to other softwareapplications, fle ible reporting capabilities, the capacity to incorporate asmany as 9,999 companies, the ability to transfer intercompany transactionsacross DECnet and multicurrency capabilities.andM;IAS users can translate any of the software's menus and error messages intoany language that reads left to right and can be supposed by a VMS charactertable.andP;  IAS can ever support translation of its menus and error messages intoKanji (Japanese script).andM;DR Labs tested IAS version 5.15 on a MicroVAX II.andP;  The software requires VMSversion 5.0 or higher and VT220 terminals or later models.andM;Unlike most American accounting programs, IA does't maintain separate modulesfor receivables and payable.andP;  Instead, IAS maintains all receivable andpayable account names in the chart of accounts (Table 1).andP;  Of the otheraccounting packages that DR Labs has reviewed, only Systems Union'sSunAccount, another British import, has adopted this practice.andP;  (For ourreview of SunAccount, see &quot;Charting an International Course,&quot; Digital Review,Nov. 7, 1988, page 67.)andM;IAS maintains all records in a single database file.andP;  One advantage to thisapproach is that all transactions are included in the general ledger as soonas they're entered.andP;  In a modular system, data is entered in a separate fileand must then be &quot;posted&quot; to integrate it into the general ledger.andM;CHART OF ACCOUNTS WON'T STOP GROWINGandM;The drawback of a database system like IAS is that its chart of accountskeeps growing.andP;  In a modular system, the chart of accounts remains relativelystatic as the master files for receivables and payables change.andM;Although Coda doesn't provide a payroll package, Cyborg Systems of Chicagooffers a package that will work with Coda's system.andP;  Users can purchase thispayroll package from Coda or directly from Cyborg.andP;  Coda also does not offera purchase-order function in IAS, although company officials say this may beadded to a future release of IAS.andM;Coda's IAS software takes advantage of a VT terminal's ability to displayfull 132-column screens, and may of IAS' inquiries require this column width.andO;Some accounting packages that run on the VAX but were created on non-DECsystems don't include this 132-column capability.andM;IAS also provides sophisticated linking capabilities.andP;  Users can transferdata between IAS and spreadsheet programs like Lotus Development's 1-2-3,Access Technology's 20/20 and microsoft's Excel by using the IASLink softwareincluded in IAS.andM;Security-conscious users will appreciate Coda's comprehensive securityfeatures: The all-in one IAS package provides layers of security that caneffectively prevent users from getting their hands on more information thanthey're authorized to access.andM;When users first start IAS, they are presented with a screen that verifiestheir identity and asks which company's records they wish to access.andP;  Aftersuccessfully navigating this initial security screen, users are presentedwith IAS' main menu, which can be displayed in one of six possible formats(Fig.andP;  1).andP;  Coda provides a variety of menu formats to accommodate userpreferences for reviewing and working with data.andM;The first format options is a full-screen representation of the numerickeypad displaying two-letter codes for each key as well as key descriptions.andO;The numeric keypad on the VT220 keyboard can be used to access all the menuselections.andP;  For example, pressing 6 on the numeric keypad calls up theIntray Maintenance function.andM;The second format option displays a list of functions and a small numerickeypad in the lower right quadrant of the screen, and the third option issimply a list of functions displayed down the center of the screen.andP;  Thefourth option presents a half-screen display of the numeric keypad only, andthe fifth is a split screen consisting of a list of functions on theleft-hand side of the screen and a numeric keypad on the right-hand side.andO;The sixth and final option is a small representation of the numeric keypadonly.andM;The user chooses a menu format by selecting the ME option at the main menu.andO;This option is also used to change the user's password, assign a defaultprinter, enable expert mode, enable logging of all keystrokes to a file,display the status of batch jobs and print jobs, and enable the DeferredPosting function.andP;  From this menu, users an also determine whether each fieldwill be terminated using a carriage return, an arrow key or the Do key.andP;  Anychanges made to the user profile using the ME menu are permanent, notsession-dependent.andM;IAS's expert mode allows users to dispense with menus altogether.andP;  In expertmode, the prompt &quot;What do you want to do?&quot;andP;  appears at the bottom of thescreen.andM;After invoking expert mode from the ME menu, the user must select severalmenu items before the menu prompts will disappear.andP;  If the user makes amistake, the prompts will reappear until the user has again demonstrated theability to navigate the menus successfully.andP;  An expert use who forgets whichmenu has been selected can press the Help key (the PF2 key) to find out.andM;Any user can enter the key sequence andless;PF1andgt; T for an express ride from anywherein the system back up to the main menu.andP;  To move across the menu treequickly, users can type a series of two-letter commands that are separated byspaces and followed by andless;PF1andgt; T.andP;  This quick maneuvering procedure can be areal boon for users who know where they want to go.andM;For example, to move from the User Maintenance menu to the Browse Accountmenu, the user would type BR BA andless;PF1andgt; T.andP;  BR is the two-letter code forBrowse, a main menu option, and BA stands for Browse Accounts, a submenuunder Browse.andM;Context-sensitive help is available from most IAS screens by pressing the PF2key twice.andM;HEART AND SOULandM;Each company in an IAS system is assigned its own account number.andP;  The IASaccount number structure can be very complex: Coda allows account fields tocontain as many as 36 alphanumeric characters, one of the longest accountnumber fields that we have come across, giving users great flexibility indesigning an accounts structure.andM;In addition, any IAS payable or receivable account can have as many as six12-character &quot;aliases&quot; (short names).andP;  Users can make use of these aliaseswhen either browsing or entering data.andM;The top classification level in the IAS system is the group.andP;  A group canhave just one company or the full 9,999 companies that IAS supports.andP;  Thenumber of groups is limited only by the amount of available disk space.andM;Coda's license allows users to install more than one copy of IAS per machine,so users can establish separate groups via additional installations.andP;  Userswho want to test their ideas may use a second installations as a testenvironment so the processing of data on the active installation isn'taffected.andM;The number of IAS installations, like the number of groups per installation,is limited only by disk space.andM;The second classification level on the IAS system is the company level.andP;  Acompany is defined as a set of accounts that always balances to zero.andP;  Acompany can be a division, a department or a function, such as sales,receiving or marketing.andP;  All of these units can also be subsumed under onecompany, if desired.andM;Each company can have as many as three separate levels of account numbers.andO;The 36-character account number field is broken into three 12-charactergroupings: the first is the &quot;nominal&quot; level; the second is the &quot;subaccounts&quot;level; and the third level is called simply &quot;Level 3.&quot;andM;Account numbers at the nominal level can have as many as 12 uppercasealphanumeric characters.andP;  There is no restriction on the format or structureof the account number.andP;  The nominal code for a small company can be brokendown into several parts--for example, two characters for the sales region,two characters for district, two characters for function and four charactersfor analysis.andM;If users can't store all the codes they need within the 12-character limit ofthe nomimal level, they can implement the subaccounts level.andP;  If a subaccountis used, the nominal record must include a marker to indicate the presence ofthe subaccount.andP;  The system will then know that it must look to a subaccountfor further information.andP;  To locate the appropriate account, the program willcheck an ownership list file.andM;If still more codes are necessary, users can create a third account level.andO;When a Level 3 account is created, a market must be placed at the subaccountlevel and an ownership list must be created.andM;The IAS package's flexible account structure allows Coda to include acomprehensive selection of options for reporting and analyzing accountinformation.andP;  Users can gain an added advantage by allocating relatednominals and subaccounts to a collection of non-contiguous account numbers,making it easy to select a related set of accounts that might be difficult tocollate via the account number.andM;The chart of accounts can be divided into three ledgers: expense ledgers,purchase accounts (accounts payable) ledgers and sales/accounts receivableledgers.andP;  Each ledger is identified by a five-character code consisting of aletter indicating the ledger type (E, P or S) and four numeric characters.andO;This classification system enables IAS users to create reports incorporatingaccounts in the three separate ledgers.andM;All financial transactions that are recorded affect two separate areas of thesystem.andP;  This dual system enables users to implement two levels of reporting.andM;The details of a transaction, which are held in a large general ledger, canbe considered &quot;in the books in ink&quot; as soon as the transaction is entered.andO;The accounts are therefore in balance after each transaction.andM;IAS also maintains a separate period balance file that is updatedautomatically every time a detail posting is made to the books.andP;  The monetaryvalue in ths period balance file is supported by a number of detail recordsin the general ledger that sum to the same amount.andM;IAS users look up information by &quot;browsing,&quot; regardless of whether they'reinquiring about general ledger records or the status of accounts receivable.andM;Customer service representatives can easily look up records for clients byusing one of six possible aliases that can be stored in a customer-vendorrecord in the chart of accounts.andP;  A vendor like DEC, for example, could haveas many as six aliases, including DEC, Digital, Olsen, Maynard, VAX, DECnetor the like.andM;Most business desks have &quot;in&quot; and &quot;out&quot; baskets.andP;  With that metaphor in mind,IAS created a part of the system called the Intray.andP;  The Intray lets usersadd documents to the system without actually entering them in the books oraffecting any balances.andM;Because the Intray isn't used to update the books, the records in the Intrayneedn't be complete and do not have to balance.andP;  Users can look at, modify,delete or report on these records.andP;  The Intray provides a place to storeincomplete entries until the details necessary to complete these entries canbe accumulated.andM;Another useful feature of the IAS system is its ability to transfertransactions between organizations comosed of more than one company ordivision.andP;  The data on the various companies in the organization needn't beon the same machine because IAS allows users to transfer transactions betweenmachines using DECnet or the X.25 protocol.andM;Using IAS' transfer capabilities, interdivisional charges can be transferredto the appropriate divisions from the head office or vice versa.andP;  Thesetransactions are either posted or transmitted to the Intray so someone canreview them before they're entered.andM;Because IAS is so flexible, Coda offers very little in the way ofpreformatted reports.andP;  The preformatted reports that are offered include atrial balance report, a currency difference report and a chart of accountslisting.andM;Coda provides two report generators.andP;  The first, the Ledger Reporting System(LRS), is designed primarily for reporting on entries made to the books ofaccount.andM;In addition, LRS can access records in the Intray and those that aremothballed or archived.andP;  LRS is vocabulary- or dictionary-driven, allowingusers to design their own report formulas by positioning text or vocabularyanywhere within a report.andM;IAS' accounts payable function can store records for the accumulation of datafor the Internal Revenue Service's 1099 tax forms.andP;  Users must access the LRSreport generator to print 1099s.andM;IAS' other report generator is the Financial Reporting System (FRS), which isdesigned to report on actual and budget account period balances.andP;  FRS is usedto generate balance sheet and income statement reports.andP;  Coda will helpbuyers write reports on a time and material basis.andM;CURRENCY FIELDSandM;Coda IAS package fully supports the Financial Accounting Standards Board'sFASB-52 requirements for foreign currency transactions.andP;  Each account masterrecord has a currency field.andP;  Users can define one currency as the homecurrency.andP;  By storing the foreign currency value with the home currency valuefor the same record, users can create a dual ledger and maintain concurrentrecords for both home and foreign currency reporting.andM;IAS lets users attach comments to accounts receivable records, a feature thatcan make it easier to work with aging reports.andP;  Credit managers typicallyreceive periodic listings for all aged accounts receivable.andP;  The manageroften makes notes on these listings of the comments that delinquent customershave submitted regarding their late payments.andP;  When the manager is presentedwith a new report, he must recopy all of these notes onto the new listing,save the old listing or throw the old listing away, forfeiting all of thecomments.andM;Coda solves this dilemma by permitting users to record the credit manager'snotes in the computer database and print them out with new listings (Fig.andO;2).andP;  As many as 69,000 lines of comments can be added to any accountsreceivable record during a browsing session.andM;IAS contains an interesting desk calculator that supports complete algebraiccalculations, trigonometric functions and logarithms.andP;  The calculator alsosupports if-then-else constructs and user-defined functions.andM;Users can access the desk calculator from within either of the reportgenerators, or they can call it up from any screen by entering andless;PF1andgt; C from afield on the screen.andP;  The calculator will then be displayed at the top of thescreen.andP;  Users can transport the result of any calculation to the fieldtheory were in by pressing andless;PF1andgt; V, and they can exit the calculator usingthe PF4 key.andM;IAS also lets uers print the screen by pressing andless;PF1andgt; P.andP;  This feature can beparticularly useful for those times when users want a hard copy of an anomalythat has appeared on the screen.andM;If a decimal point isn't keyed in, IAS will assume that the decimal pointshould appear after the final number.andP;  The entry 1000 would therefore beinterpreted as $1,000, and 100001 would be interpreted as $100,001.andP;  To enter$1,000.01, users would have to key in the decimal point.andM;Users trained on 10-key adding machines--which don't require users to enterdecimal points--may find this entry feature annoying.andP;  Unfortunately, IAS,like most of the accounting packages we've reviewed, doesn't offer users achoice of entry methods.andM;IAS incorporates extensive security provisions.andP;  The user profile accessedfrom the User Maintenance menu reveals a screen with fields that areassociated with each user.andP;  The fields pertain to security and user-specificcustomization of the IAS system.andM;The IAS system manager can implement the use of case-sensitive userpasswords, assign user security levels, establish the maximum monetary valuethat each user is allowed to write off for each company, determine theperiods to which the user can post, enable or bar the user from changingcurrency rates, and determine whether the user can view the details ofdocuments and change status codes while browsing.andM;In addition, users can be restricted to certain ledgers, nominals,subaccounts or account groups.andP;  Users can also be restricted to certain mainmenu functions: Functions that aren't allowed won't appear on the user'sscreen.andM;Furthermore, time periods can be assigned levels ranging from zero to nine,allowing users to access only those periods at or below the levels to whichthey themselves have been assigned.andP;  A user who has been assigned to Level 2,for example, could not access the April period if it had been assigned toLevel 4.andM;FINE-TUNING SECURITYandM;By adjusting the security levels for each account, period and user, IASmanagers can fine-tune the system to determine exactly what each user can andcannot do.andM;IAS includes logging features that managers can activate if desired.andP;  Theprogram maintains a log file of stop codes that are generated by the system,as well as user names and password errors.andM;In addition, IAS maintains a file that logs the changes made to masterrecords on the system, indicating when these changes were made and by whom.andO;Additions, modifications and deletions of accounts, names and addresses, andcurrency master records are recorded here.andM;Individual user passwords are kept in separate files that also specify whichlanguage the user will be working in and whether the user can suppress menus,operating as an &quot;expert.&quot;andP;  This file also indicates whether the user can beleft in, or must be logged out of, VMS upon leaving IAS.andM;IAS comes with four manuals bound in three-ring binders.andP;  The first is amanual for operators.andP;  The second manual, the report manual, containsinformation on ledger reporting and financial reporting.andP;  IAS also comes witha manual for system managers and a management manual.andM;The manuals reveal the program's United Kingdom origins, including Briticismssuch as &quot;enquires&quot; and &quot;calendarisation,&quot; a term referring to the practice ofspreading values over a number of periods.andM;A users' group composed of IAS licensees has recently been formed.andP;  There areapproximately 56 license holders in North America who are part of the users'group, and about 400 licensees worldwide.andP;  Coda has excluded itself fromparticipation in the group, and company officials will not attend groupmeetings unless invited.andM;Maintenance for IAS is priced at an annual charge of 15 percent of theproduct's current list price.andP;  Updates have been appearing approximatelyquarterly for minor changes; functional updates have been occurringapproximately yearly.andP;  Unlimited phone support is available from 7:30 a.m.andO;to 7:30 p.m.andP;  EST, and CODA is considering implementing 24-hour coverage.andO;Coda maintains eight certified public accountants on its staff, all locatedin Manchester, N.H.andM;Training is $275 per day in Manchester or $2,250 per day at the user's site.andO;Coda has recently opened an office in Calgary, Alberta, for sales andsupport, along with a sales office in Costa Mesa, Calif.andM;Coda's IAS is an expensive, albeit well-designed, accounting package (Table2).andP;  The American branch is eager to make inroads into the VAX market and isdemonstrating this eagerness through its impressive support system andattention to customer needs.andM;Although the software doesn't include its own payroll and purchase orderfeatures, the functions that it does include work extremely well.andP;  Companieswhose primary needs can be satisfied with general ledger, accounts payableand accounts receivable functions will find IAS quite powerful and flexible.andO;The package deserves special commendation for its ability to produceoutstanding reports, incorporate foreign currencies and transfer financialdata electronically to remote locations.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
