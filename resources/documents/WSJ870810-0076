The rating concern cited a series of debt-financed acquisitions starting with that of Richardson-Vicks Inc. in 1985 and including last week's proposal to buy Blendax Group of West Germany at an estimated price of as much as $400 million. Sandamp;P said the company has &quot;resorted to acquisitions to improve profitability&quot; as its return on capital has fallen below 16% over the past two years with &quot;little hope of immediate reversal.&quot; As a result of its acquisition debt, Sandamp;P said, the company's leverage is &quot;above what is acceptable for triple-A-rated debt with sub-par profitability.&quot; A spokeswoman, saying Pandamp;G &quot;wouldn't take losing the (triple-A) rating lightly,&quot; said the company will meet with Sandamp;P in early September to discuss the review.    ---   COOPER COS. -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. lowered to single-B-3 from single-B-1 its ratings on $200 million of the company's debt, citing Cooper's recent operating losses and its &quot;uncertain outlook for future profitability.&quot; Cooper, a Palo Alto, Calif.-based maker of eye care products, was called CooperVision Inc. until last month. The downgrade affects Cooper's 10 7/8% senior subordinated debentures due 1998 and 8 5/8% convertible subordinated debentures due 2005. Moody's said Cooper's recent operating losses &quot;reflect both difficult industry conditions in the company's two major product areas and significantly increased expense levels.&quot; Moody's added that it thinks Cooper's margins will be under pressure &quot;for the forseeable future,&quot; although it noted that the company's 68% interest in an affiliated concern provides debt holders with &quot;a degree of asset protection.&quot; A Cooper spokesman said, &quot;We don't agree with the downgrading, because it reflects historical results and we would point out that the company is in a turnaround situation.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
