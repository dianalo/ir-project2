Theauthors discuss the advantages of the 3D-CT imaging technique in thediagnosis and surgical planning for craniosynostosis. The following conclusionsmay be drawn: 1) The images obtained from the new 3D-CT software aremore accurate and realistic than the images previously reported by Vannierand Marsh. Reconstruction artifacts, known as pseudoforamina, have notappeared in the 3D-CT images reconstructed by the new software, and thetop axial view of the 3D-CT reveals precisely anatomical details of theintracranial skull base. 2) The use of this new method provides accurateanatomical data which cannot be obtained by means of conventional radiologicaltechniques in living subjects. 3) This technique of three-dimensionalreconstruction from CT scans is most helpful in surgical planning andin the postoperative assessments of surgical results for craniosynostosis.The 3D-CT images allow the surgeon to visualize precisely the abnormalitiesof the skull to be corrected by the craniofacial surgery. Based on ourexperience with this study, we would expect that three-dimensional surfacereconstruction from CT scans will henceforth be widely used in the planningof craniofacial surgery and in the postoperative follow-up assessmentof craniosynostosis or craniofacial anomalies.
