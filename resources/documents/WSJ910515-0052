Specifically, Motown alleged that MCA has refused topromote Motown records to pop radio stations, limitingMotown's airplay and damaging its chances for generating&quot;crossover&quot; hits for general audiences. Motown alsomaintained that while MCA &quot;systematically breached&quot; theagreement, it continued to collect distribution fees fromMotown that are extraordinary by industry standards. MCAdenied the allegations.   The suit seeks &quot;tens of millions of dollars&quot; in damages.Motown is owned by several limited partners, includingaffiliates of Boston Ventures Management Inc., MCA RecordVentures, singer Diana Ross and Motown President JherylBusby.   MCA alleged that Boston Ventures specializes in makingshort-term investments in entertainment companies. In thiscase, Boston Ventures has become &quot;frustrated at its inabilityto garner the return it had originally hoped to obtain inpurchasing the company with MCA.&quot; Boston Ventures wouldn'tcomment.   Motown, which was sold by founder Berry Gordy Jr. to thelimited partners in 1988 for $61 million, signed themarketing, administration and distribution contract with MCAin June 1988.   The suit alleged that MCA charges Motown a 25% fee --&quot;much higher than the industry norm {of 11% to 14%} fortraditional distribution services -- for pop promotion andother undelivered services.&quot; MCA's alleged failure to provideservices to Motown has forced the company, in many cases, toassemble its own staff and systems at considerable expense,the suit said.   Motown's suit said it lost at least 500,000 unit sales ofthe soundtrack from Spike Lee's film, &quot;Do the Right Thing,&quot;after MCA couldn't fill orders for Motown products for amonth in 1989. Motown has such veteran stars as StevieWonder, Lionel Richie, and the Temptations.   The suit also claimed that MCA lost millions of dollars insales of Motown records by not filling customers' orders forrecords when they were stored in MCA warehouses. MCA thenneedlessly manufactured millions of dollars worth of the sametitles, the suit alleged.   Motown alleged that MCA charged Motown prices for compactdisks that exceeded the industry average by 20 cents or moreeach, amounting to millions of dollars of purportedovercharges.   MCA said Boston Ventures has no experience in the recordbusiness and has been attempting to renegotiate the agreementover the past year.</TEXT></DOC>
