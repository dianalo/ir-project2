The aerospace contractor said Tuesday that its net income roseto $139.6 million, or $2.97 a share, for the first three months ofthe year from $40.6 million, or 87 cents a share, in the sameperiod last year.   First-quarter sales fell to $1.37 billion from $1.41 billion in1987.   The latest results were helped by a tax accounting change thatincreased earnings by $135.1 million, the company said.   Northrop's operating profit in its aircraft, electronics andservices businesses fell 35 percent to $67.5 million from $103.6million a year earlier.   The reduction in sales was attributed to lower sales in thecompany's electronic countermeasures product line and to a lowerlevel of customer-sponsored research and development.   Nonetheless, the company reported increased deliveries of themain fuselage section for the Boeing 747 jetliner and increasedsales in the MX Peacekeeper program.   Northrop is the prime contractor on the B-2 Advanced TechnologyBomber, also known as the ``stealth bomber'' because of itsradar-evading characteristics.   The company said the earnings were also depressed by anunspecified amount as the company continued to spend on developmentof a prototype of the Air Force's 21st century warplane, theAdvanced Tactical Fighter.</TEXT></DOC>
