Hesse, Chairman; Charles G. Stalon,Charles A. Trabandit, Elizabeth Anne Moler and Jerry J. Langdon.</ITAG>On May 31, 1984, the Oil Conservation Division of the State of New Mexico(New Mexico) notified the Commission that eight natural gas wells locatedin Lea County, New Mexcio, do not qualify as stripper gas wells under section108 of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (NGPA).\1\<NOTE/> New Mexico states that gas produced from each well eitherexceeds that 60 Mcf/day limit for the 90-day qualifying period or the 12-monthperiod used to establish the maximum efficient rate of flow (MER) for thewell or exceeds the applicable gas/oil ratio in andSection; 271.803(b) ofthe regulations.\2\<NOTE/> The gas produced from the subject wells is processed in aplant for the extraction of natural gas liquids, and the residue gas volumesare less than wellhead volumes of gas. New Mexico, however uses the higher``raw'' gas wellhead volumes to calculate the average daily production.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ 15 U.S.C. 3318 (1982). Under section 108 a well may qualifyas a stripper well if it produces no more than an average of 60 Mcf perday of nonassociated natural gas per production day during the preceding90-day production period provided that the well produced at its maximumefficient rate of flow (MER) during such period. For purposes of establishingan MER, andSection; 271.807(b) of the regulations provides that 12 monthsof production may be used if that data shows that production did not exceedan average of 60 Mcf per production day during the period. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ 18 CFR 271.803(b) (1988). That section specifies the maximumamounts of oil that a stripper well can produce during the qualifying periodwhich vary with the amount of gas produced: <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,s25,xs36 </C> <H1>Daily gas average during 90-day production period </H1><H1>Allowable oil production (BBL/Day)</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">50 Mcf to 60 Mcf <D>1 BBL.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">30 Mcf or more but less than 50 Mcf <D>2 BBL. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Less than 30 Mcf <D>3BBL.</D></ITAG></ITAG> On July 6, 1984, Gulf Oil Corporation (now Chevron U.S.A. Inc.) filed aprotest stating that New Mexico's determinations were erroneous because271.804(a)(2) of the Commission's regulations permits production to bemeasured either before or after the extraction of natural gas liquids.\3\<NOTE/> Gulf supports its argument by quoting the NGPA ConferenceReport which states that ``The 60 Mcf per day measurement is intended tobe applied after extraction of natural gas liquids; production of naturalgas liquids does not disqualify a well from qualifying as a natural gasstripper well.'' \4\<NOTE/> Accordingly, Gulf urges that production from the wells didnot exceed the maximum and the wells qualified as stripper well.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ 18 CFR 271.804(a)(2) (1985). That section provides that``Production may be measured either before or after the extraction of naturalgas liquids.''<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ H.R. REP. No. 95-1752, 95th Cong., 2d. Sess. 89, reprintedin 1978 U.S. CODE CONG. andamp; AD. NEWS 8983, 9005. On July 13, 1984, Commission staff sent New Mexico a letter tolling theeffectiveness of the negative determinations and advising it that Commissionregulations permit production to be measured either before or after theextraction of natural gas liquids. Staff noted that production from thesubject wells, when measured after natural gas liquids were extracted,meet the stripper well requirements. The letter requested a statement explainingthe basis for the negative determinations. No response was received atthat time. On March 10, 1988 staff sent New Mexico another letter. In it staff (a)informed New Mexico of the Commission's position that the production volumesfrom the subject wells when measured after the extraction of natural gasliquids meet the stripper well requirements; (b) submitted staff's calculations,consistent with the Commission's decision in <T3>Ladd Petroleum Corp.</T3>,\5\<NOTE/> showing that the 90-day and 12-month averages for each wellmeet the requirements of the Commission's stripper well regulations; and(c) requested New Mexico to consider making affirmative determinationsfor the wells. On May 27, 1988, New Mexico responded by stating that itdoes not believe the subject wells qualify under section 108 of the NGPA,and declining the Commission's suggestion to reconsider the prior negativedetermination.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ In Ladd Petroleum Corporation, 24 FERC andpara; 61,117 (1983)the Commission concluded that Congress, in determining what constitutes``non-associated natural gas,'' intended that volumes of liquids hydrocarbonsproduced from a well would not disqualify a well as a stripper well. As the attached appendix shows,\6\<NOTE/> if production is measured after the extraction of liquidsas permitted by the Commission's regulations, the wells qualify as stripperwells. Because the Commission's regulations are controlling, we find thatthe eight negative notices of determinations submitted by New Mexico arenot supported by substantial evidence. Accordingly, the Commission issuesthis preliminary finding under section 275.202 of the Commission's regulations.\7\<NOTE/> Under andSection; 275.202(f), New Mexico or any person may,within 30 days after issuance of this preliminary finding, submit writtencomments and request an informal conference with the Commission staff.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ The attached appendix also shows New Mexico's calculationsusing wellhead volumes.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ 18 CFR 275.202 (1988). <T3>The Commission orders</T3>: (A) Under andSection; 275.202(a) of the Commission's regulations, the Commissionfinds that the eight negative notices of determinations submitted by NewMexico in this docket are not supported by substantial evidence in therecord on which the determinations were made. (B) Within 30 days from the date of this order, New Mexico, Gulf, or anyother interested party may submit comments or request an informal conferencewith Commission staff.<ITAG tagnum="21">By the Commission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Lois D.
