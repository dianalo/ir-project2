Previously, researchers had reported success by immunizinganimals with vaccines made from whole, killed virus to elicitan immune response. However, the safer gene-spliced vaccineshave achieved only partial protection until now.</LP><TEXT>   Now in a hopeful new report, Shiu-Lok Hu and hiscolleagues at Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.'s PharmaceuticalResearch Institute in Seattle said his vaccine preventedinfection by simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) in all fourrhesus macaque monkeys that received it. SIV is related tohuman immunodeficiency virus -- or HIV -- the virus thatcauses AIDS. Still, some experts said the report leaves somequestions unanswered.   &quot;It's a little bit surprising, actually,&quot; Dr. Huacknowedged. &quot;We didn't expect the result to be soclear-cut.&quot; His report, which follows seven years of vaccinework, is published in this week's edition of the journalScience.   Dr. Hu employed a two-step regimen in which the animalswere first given a &quot;primer&quot; vaccine, made of live vacciniavirus into which they stitched genes for SIV's outer envelopeprotein. Vaccinia -- or cow pox virus -- is a workhorsestaple of vaccines, used to prevent smallpox. But here itsjob was to churn out copies of the SIV protein to trick theanimal's immune system into mounting a defense.   Later, the animals were given a booster shot of pure SIVenvelope protein. Four weeks after their booster shots, themonkeys received an intravenous injection of live SIV tocheck their immunity. All four remained free of infection,while four unvaccinated animals came down with SIV.   The experiment itself provides a booster shot of optimismto a field recently shaken by findings that past animalvaccine tests were clouded by animals' reaction to humancells in the preparation, rather than to the virus itself.Moreover, using a gene-spliced vaccine is regarded as a safermodel for potential human use than vaccines based on wholevirus, which carry a risk of infection.   Bristol-Myers and the National Institutes of Healthalready have tested a similar vaccine model usinggene-spliced HIV proteins to vaccinate 10 healthy volunteers.Vanderbilt University scientists reported last summer thatthe volunteers showed strong immune reactions.   The Bristol-Myers experiment, however, doesn't guaranteeany breakthrough for AIDS prevention in people, outsideexperts said.   &quot;I'm afraid the general public will think an AIDS vaccineis just around the corner,&quot; said Ronald DesRosiers of HarvardUniversity. &quot;But just because it worked in the laboratory,doesn't mean it will work in the real world.&quot;   &quot;What's still unexplained, is why did this test work,while a lot of others failed?&quot; said Dani Bolognesi of DukeUniversity. Both experts said the Bristol-Myers test used adifferent strain of SIV than most other research groups.   Dr. DesRosiers strongly cautioned that all such vaccinetests are idealized, because they challenge animals withexactly the same virus strain contained in the vaccine. Underreal-life conditions, people are randomly exposed to a widerange of virus strains that might defeat the vaccine.   In Seattle, Dr. Hu said he plans to challenge the animalssoon with a different virus strain to see whether theirimmunity holds firm.</TEXT></DOC>
