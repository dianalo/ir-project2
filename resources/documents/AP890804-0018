(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Throwing flowers, candy and coins,more than 1,000 cheering residents of this key Black Sea port gavea riotous welcome today to U.S. Navy warships cruising intoSevastopol's historic harbor.   ``That's for ice cream when you come ashore,'' called one womanin the crowd as she lobbed a 20-kopeck coin toward the Americansailors lined along the ships' decks in their blinding summerwhites.   The visiting seamen, who sent dozens of round sailor hatswhizzing to the whistling, waving crowd, were equally excited.   ``It just feels great to be making history,'' said Greg Marlatt,medical officer aboard the cruiser USS Thomas S. Gates.   The good-will port call by the Gates and the frigate USSKauffman mirrored a visit last month by three Soviet ships toNorfolk, Va., in the first such Soviet-American naval exchange in14 years.   The U.S. Sixth Fleet's flagship, the USS Belknap, also was tojoin but was diverted to be at President Bush's disposal during thehostage crisis in Lebanon.   The ships' visit to Sevastopol is the first since World War II.Three U.S. warships docked in Leningrad in 1975.   Sevastopol, headquarters of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet, normallyis a closed city, even to Soviets. But today it opened its gateswide to greet the American sailors.   Crewmen were mobbed by beaming Soviets, handed babies to kiss,asked to pose for snapshots and given rubles, souvenirs and food. Abrass band played marches and two women in traditional costume metthe ship with bread and salt, symbols of hospitality.   ``My whole soul is happy that we finally did this great thingand that we will be friends,'' said 18-year-old ZinaidaKolisinchenko. ``And the American sailors, they are so attractive.''   Vladimir Zverev, the military commandant of Sevastopol, lookwith bemusement at the crowd on the pier. ``We didn't expect somany people,'' he said. ``This is the biggest reception for a shipI have ever seen here.''   Zverev admitted the city is not accustomed to giving such anopen welcome to Western guests, but said, ``it is appropriate giventhe state of our relations today.''   The American sailors, too, commented on the strange sensation ofsuddenly being treated as such good friends.   Aviator Matt Zentry of Seattle, Wash., recalled going throughrecognition training to learn how to pick out Soviet ships fromafar. ``And now, here were are right next to them,'' he said.   ``For so long we thought of them as possible adversaries, andall of a sudden that is gone in a minute,'' said public affairsofficer Paul Weishautt.   Above Count's Pier, where the American ships docked, a redbanner proclaimed in English: ``Mutual understanding and trustbetween the people of the U.S.A. and the U.S.S.R. is the path topeace and security.''   The Americans will tour state farms, a vineyard, an art museum,an aquarium, a war museum, and naval installations. They will beentertained at concerts, eat meals aboard Soviet ships and playbasketball, soccer and volleyball with their Soviet counterparts.</TEXT></DOC>
