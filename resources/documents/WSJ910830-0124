About 40,000 employees now are legally entitled to strikeover their wage demands, although many others are defined asessential workers and prohibited from striking.</LP><TEXT>   Daryl Bean, president of the Public Service Alliance ofCanada, which represents the workers, said a mass stoppage bygovernment workers won't occur immediately but that unionmembers will take &quot;escalating job actions&quot; over the next fewdays.   Customs and excise officers -- who are among those notallowed to strike -- have threatened to delay airport trafficand crossings at the Canada-U.S. border by increasing routinesearches.   Tax collection officers, employment counselors andpurchasing and procurement staff are among those who canlegally strike today. Grain and food inspectors, railwayworkers and government clerks could join the protest by theend of next week, when their contracts expire.   Mr. Bean said government services could eventually &quot;grindto a halt,&quot; but the government has said it will passlegislation to bring union members back to work if a seriousstrike occurs.   The main issue in the dispute is the wage-restraintmeasures introduced by the government this year, whichprovide employees no pay increase this year and 3% increasesin each of the next two years.   This is the second major Canadian labor dispute to breakout in the past week. Postal workers began rotating strikeslast weekend that have interrupted some mail delivery.</TEXT></DOC>
