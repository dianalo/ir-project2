Edwin A. Hind, chief of the U.S. government's MutualDefense Assistance Office in Japan, said in an interview.They include three proposals by Japan during the most recentsuch formal set of talks in 1988, and seven more suggested byU.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney during a trip here earlierthis year.   &quot;Beyond that, there may be some more ideas,&quot; Col. Hindsaid. &quot;We're continuously interested in presenting new agendaitems.&quot;   He refused to identify the technologies underconsideration, but the Japanese press has widely reported thelist, which ranges from missile seekers to military-usesemiconductors.   A spokesman for Japan's Defense Agency confirmed thatbilateral meetings are scheduled to explore &quot;joint researchbetween the U.S. and Japan&quot; but said he didn't know any moredetails.   Col. Hind said he didn't know how receptive the Japanesewould be to the American list, but one U.S. official familiarwith the pending talks said their success probably would belimited, as many of the technologies are controlled byJapanese industry and not the Japanese government. Hespeculated that, at best, the JDA could facilitate tiesbetween U.S. and Japanese companies.   The discussions, labeled the Systems and Technology Forum,aren't formal negotiations and don't require a bilateralagreement. The likely result of the talks will be theestablishment of working groups in each of the technologyareas that the two countries want to work on.   The U.S. and Japan have talked for a decade about tryingto balance the outflow of American technology, as Japan hasraced ahead in certain technological fields. In addition,many Americans argue that Japan should share more of theburden for its military protection, and that debate hasintensified during the Persian Gulf crisis.   But the two sides have taken little specific action. Japandid in 1983 decide to exempt the U.S. from a postwar ban onmilitary exports, but government and industry reluctancelingered.   Meanwhile, U.S. officials, despite their rhetoric, haven'tmade the issue a top priority. The Defense Departmentrecently appointed Albert J. Kelley to fill the long-vacantpost of deputy undersecretary for international programs, whooversees such matters. He apparently pushed to hold themeetings this month, even though many officials familiar withthe process had earlier said the forum talks couldn't takeplace until November at the earliest.</TEXT></DOC>
