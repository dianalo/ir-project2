They are telling people what roads are closed and just keeping the public informed has helped to keep the panic down,&quot; said James Ball, a station supervisor at Daly City Police Department.    Mr. Ball noted that television stations featured people holding up phone books, explaining where to call for help. Radio stations provided an emergency number for people who smelled gas but didn't know how to turn off their gas supply.    Kim Schwartz, a spokesperson for the American Red Cross in Los Angeles, said television and radio stations in San Francisco played a &quot;very positive role&quot; by providing the address of 28 shelters of the Red Cross and by giving out the Red Cross number for contributions to help earthquake victims (1-800-453-9000).    The San Francisco Examiner issued a special edition around noon yesterday that was filled entirely with earthquake news and information. The Examiner and the San Francisco Chronicle were able to publish despite Tuesday's quake, which occurred close to deadline for many newspapers. </TEXT></DOC>
