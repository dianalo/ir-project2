Inc. said it completed a management-led plan to take the company private in a leveraged buyout for $38.50 a share, or $1.25 billion.    The investor group acquiring Revco is Anac Holding Corp., a newly formed, closely held company that includes about 35 members of current Revco management. Revco operates more than 2,000 drug stores.    Revco said letters of transmittal with instructions for obtaining the cash payment are being mailed to all holders. In a leveraged buyout, a company is acquired largely with borrowed funds that are repaid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or through asset sales. </TEXT></DOC>
