SENTENCED 07/17/91 PHOENIX, ARIZONA,U.S.A., 1991 JUL 17 (NB) -- The Maricopa County Arizona County Attorney'sOffice has announced the sentencing of Baron Majette, 20 , also known as DocSavage, for computer-related crimes uncovered in the joint federal/stateinvestigation known as &quot;Sundevil.&quot;andM;Majette was arrested on March 27 of this year and charged with a number offelony charges relating to unauthorized use of telephone facilities of Toys'R Us to make calls worth approximately $8,000, illegal access of TRW'scredit database and use of information obtained therein to obtain in excessof $50,000 in cash, goods, and services, and stealing of credit cards fromU.S.andP;  mail boxes and use of the cards to obtain approximately $10,000 incash, goods and services.andM;If convicted of the charges, Majette faced a possible jail sentence of 15years and the requirement to make restitution for the full amount of thealleged losses endured by the firms and individualsandM;In late May, Majette pleaded guilty to an amended charge of a single count ofcomputer fraud, felony third degree.andP;  The reduced charge was a result of anagreement between Mark Berardoni, the public defender assigned to Majette,Janet Black, Majette's probation officer, and the Maricopa County ArizonaCounty Attorney's Office.andP;  Under the reduced charges, Majette's maximum termof incarceration was reduced from the aforementioned 15 years to 5.andM;On July 16, when the actual sentence was to be imposed, a further agreementbetween the prosecution, defense and parole service was presented to thepresiding judge, Justice Gottsfield, and, after discussion, became the actualsentence.andP;  The court decision imposed the following:andM;andlsqb;andrsqb; Majette will remain in jail for up to two months while he awaits placementin a &quot;shock incarceration&quot; program (Majette has been in jail since his March27 arrest because of parole violation related to an earlier crime).andO;Assistant County Attorney Gail Thackeray told Newsbytes that shockincarceration is a 120-day program which &quot;provides both intensive counselingand military-like discipline and exercise.&quot;andM;andlsqb;andrsqb; Upon his release from Shock Incarceration, Majette will enter a 5 yearperiod of &quot;intensive probation.&quot; Under Arizona procedures, the subject mustprovide the probation officer, on a weekly basis, a schedule for the nextweek's activities.andP;  In the event that the schedule has to be modified in anyway, the probation office must be called before the new schedule is enacted.andM;andlsqb;andrsqb; During the time of intensive probation, the probation officer may visit orcall the subject at any time of day or night to insure compliance with theschedule.andM;andlsqb;andrsqb; If, at some point after a year of intensive probation, the probationofficer feels that the subject has followed the rules and shown thatintensive procedure is no longer warranted, the subject and probation officermay recommend to the sentencing judge that the subject be transferred tonormal probation.andP;  In normal probation, the subject advises the officerweekly of progress and problems.andP;  There is not the hovering presence felt inintensive probation, according to Thackeray.andM;Additionally, the subject may be released from any form of probation at thepetition of the probation office and subject and approval, after hearing, ofthe sentencing judge.andM;andlsqb;andrsqb; If, on the other hand, Majette violates the terms of his probation, he isliable for incarceration in prison for the remainder of his probationaryperiod.andM;andlsqb;andrsqb; Majette was also ordered to make restitution to the parties victimized byhis activities by paying a sum of $19,774.03 to those involved.andP;  The sum isto be paid on a monthly basis over the course of his sentence.andP;  Additionally,he was ordered to make payments to help defray the cost of his probationarysupervision.andM;Under the terms of his probation, Majette is subject to the followingconditions said by Thackeray to be unique to his type of offense:andM;andlsqb;andrsqb; He may not use any computer connected to a modem or communications networkwithout the prior permission of his probation officer.andP;  In the event that hetakes a job that brings him into contact with computer activities, he mustnotify someone in the employer's office of the restrictions on his computeruse and must discuss the planned activities with his probation officer.andM;andlsqb;andrsqb; He is not to communicate or associate with &quot;members of the computerunderground&quot; (defined as persons such as those known to have or reasonablybelieved to have been involved in theft of communications services, computerfraud or related activities).andP;  In the event that any such individuals contacthim, he must report the contact to his probation officer.andP;  According toThackeray, this stipulation is intended for Majette' s protection.andM;andlsqb;andrsqb; &quot;In the event that the contacting party is investigated or arrested andphone records show a call to Majette, his notification to his probationofficer of the call will stand as proof that he was not involved in anyconspiracy with the other individual.andP;  His notification responsibility in noway requires him to co-operate with authorities in the location orapprehension of another individual and such co-operation is neither expectednor desired.&quot;andM;Transcripts of the sentencing hearing reportedly show that it was theintention of Judge Gottsfield to sentence Majette to a straight five years inprison but was dissuaded by the combined recommendations of the prosecution,defense and probation office.andP;  Thackeray explained to Newsbytes the rationaleof the prosecution in recommending a lighter sentenceandM;&quot;Usually computer hackers who get into trouble for activities of this natureare kids or young adults who are not the type to be in trouble for any othercriminal activities.andP;  The point of sentencing in these cases should berehabilitation.andP;  If we can break the pattern of illegal behavior, societywill benefit from Majette's participation.andP;  If we simply locked him up for 5years, neither he nor society would benefit,&quot; she said.andM;(Barbara E.
