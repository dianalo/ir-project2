In May, Burlington agreed to a leveraged buyout proposed by a Morgan Stanley andamp; Co.-backed group at a price ultimately bid up to $78 a share, or $2.16 billion. Analysts had predicted that the textile company would be forced to restructure significantly to repay the huge debt necessary to complete the transaction.    In a leveraged buyout, a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing. Ultimately, the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or sale of its assets.    Though the announced reduction represents a tiny portion of the company's total work force of 43,000, Burlington said there may be more cutbacks as all areas of the company evaluate their needs.    The company said the staff reduction was part of an overall restructuring that will include selling some businesses, &quot;disposing of some assets that aren't essential to the company's basic operations, and adopting a more decentralized structure.&quot;    The company said many of the corporate staff functions, as well as research and development programs, will be transferred to various divisions. The headquarters and research and development staff includes about 1,140 people.    Burlington shares closed yesterday at $76, off $1, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. </TEXT></DOC>
