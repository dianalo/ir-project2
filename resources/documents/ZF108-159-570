(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>High flying workstationandM;What's the difference between a PC and a workstation?andP;  It's not power,high-resolution graphics or Unix, because PCs have had all those things forsome time.andM;One difference has been price.andP;  Workstations used to cost over double what afully kitted out PC would.andP;  That's changing.andP;  My thesis is this: there's nolonger any difference between PCs and workstations at the high end other thanpronunciation.andM;It's still horses for courses, however.andP;  You don't need a workstation/PC torun WordStar or Super-Calc--you'd buy a cheap AT clone.andP;  But at the top end,the distinction is blurrred.andP;  Where time is money, the classic workstation iscompeting head-to-head with the new family of 486 PCs.andM;Here's PC User's first workstation review.andP;  The Data General AViiON 300 runsDOS after a fashion and provides better than 486 power at 386 prices.andP;  TheAViiON doesn't look like a PC.andP;  In fact, it looks like a big monitor on athick plinth, and it's that plinth which holds 20mips of computer.andM;The system box is only 2-1/2 inches high at the front but the back gains aninch to accommodate the power supply.andP;  The footprint is about 17 inchessquare.andP;  The mouse port is on the right side of the box, just ahea of thereset button.andP;  The keyboard port is on the opposite side, near the back.andO;Other assorted ports are all rear mounted.andP;  On the colour machines, like myreview example, the monitor has separate R, G and B connectors; mono boxesget just the one.andP;  The lid comes off the system unit by undoing two knurledscrews -- tools aren't required.andM;No EISA versus MCA controversy here; the AViiON hasn't a single expansionconnector inside.andP;  Unless, of course, you want to count the memory expansionslots.andP;  There are seven and each takes a DG-proprietary SIMM-like memoryboard.andP;  Shame on DG for reinventing the wheel and then charging extra for it!andO;The 4Mb modules cost an exorbitant (by PC standards, anyway) 2,322 [pounds].andO;The AViiON that I had was kitted out with 12Mb, four above the usual coloursystem specification.andP;  The maximum is 28Mb until DG discovers 4Mbit chips.andM;The AViiON doesn't really need a PC-style expansion bus.andP;  It comes completewith integrated asynchronous SCSI controller, built in IEEE 802.3 standard10Mbit Ethernet, the usual RS 232/422 serial and parallel ports and its ownproprietary video controller.andP;  What would you want to add?andM;Unless the AViiON is to live by Ethernet alone, the chance is that you'd wantto add disk storage and a tape unit.andP;  That's what the SCSI interface is for.andO;DG provides a matching white box with its own power supply to make additionof mass storage peripherals an exercise in good taste.andM;Two denominations of hard disk are offered: 180 and 320Mb, both with sub-17msaverage access times.andP;  The review AViiON had the larger.andP;  The tape driveoption is a 150Mb, the de facto standard for Unix data and applicationinterchange.andP;  The hard disk was a bit noisy in contrast to the workstation'svirtually silent operation.andM;You can attach up to three enclosures with a total of up to seven SCSIdevices yielding close to 1Gb of storage if required.andP;  Other possibleresidents for the shoebox-size boxes include 1.2Mb or 1.44Mb floppy diskdrives.andM;The Motorola 88100 that forms the heart of the AViiOn is RISC architecturepersonified (see RISC boxout).andP;  The 88K (as it's known to its intimates) hasbuilt-in support for multiprocessing which DG and others are taking advantageof in high-end machines.andP;  Like the i486, the 88K has had its share ofteething troubles but final revisions are now complete and the problems withdouble precision floating point multiply exceptions have been sorted out.andO;Apparently, the 88200 held a few last-minute surprises for designers as well.andM;The AViiON I tested ran at 20MHz, the fastest now on offer, but there's a16.7MHz version as well.andP;  The slower of the two is rated at 17mips, and thefaster, coincidentally, at 20mips, is based on the industry standardDhrystone benchmarks.andM;The 88100 has both an integral floating point adder and multiplier whichbeefs up floating point performance by using parallel data paths.andP;  There arealso integer execution and instruction units, a register file and ascoreboard register.andM;Cacheing and memory management are handled by two 88200s aka CMMUs for somereason.andP;  One is exclusively for data, the other for instructions.andP;  The dualbus arrangement allows data transactions and instruction fetches to operateindependently.andP;  The caches operate at clock speed and can service the CPUwithin one clock cycle.andP;  That's less than zero wait states in the PC world.andO;The CMMUs were designed with multi-processing in mind with both write-throughand copy-back cacheing modes.andP;  Multiple cache coherency is maintained by 'bussnooping'.andP;  If the system writes or reads to a modified location, the cacheflushes.andM;The 88100 and 88200s are the big packages in the middle of the motherboard(see photo, page 44) They're mounted on a 32-bit main system bus along withthe graphics co-processor and memory.andP;  The I/O bus is also 32 bits wide andtakes the Ethernet and SCSI traffic as well as the low-speed peripheralchatter.andP;  There's 2Kb of non-volatile configuration RAM and a battery backedclock.andP;  The AViiON has all the familiar PC building blocks but in a slightlydifferent form.andP;  The motherboard used some SMT but it was mostly pin-in-holetechnology.andM;The AViiON is really made for users with display size fixations.andP;  The 20-inchmonochrome screen displays 1,280x1,024 pixels with 1,638x1,024 addressable.andO;The 19-inh colour screen (as fitted to my evaluation machine) has the samedisplay resolution but has 1,280x1,536 addressable.andP;  The portion of thescreen that's addressable but not displayed is used for storage of fonts ormenus.andP;  Both of the monitors have 1:1 aspect rations for round circles anduse a flicker-free 70Hz refresh frequency.andM;The graphics processors are tightly coupled to the processor bus for highperformance.andP;  The mono system uses an NEC uPD72120 processor while the coloursystem has a proprietary chip.andP;  Both use 1Mb of VRAM.andP;  An optional 4Mb can befitted to the colour system.andP;  The colour screen supports 256 displayablecolours from a palette of 16.7 million shades.andM;A hot graphics engine is needed to shove more than a mega pixel of displayaround.andP;  The AViiON seems to have it.andP;  DG advises that the colour system candraw 45,000 16x16 characters per second or BITBLT up to 40 million pixels persecond (fill/clear operations).andP;  Vector operations are just as fast: 200Kb of10-pixel long random vectors per second.andM;After hitting the three power switches to get the AViiON running, you can sitback and relax while the machine checks itself out and loads DG/UX 4.10, DataGeneral's massaded version of ATandamp;T's System V.3 Release 1.andP;  DG/UXincorporates almost all of Berkley Software Distribution (BSD) 4.3 as well asthe X-Window System Version 11 Release 3 and NFS.andP;  TCP/IP is bundled as wellfor talking to the Ethernet port.andM;DG/UX is fully Posix compliant.andP;  The AViiON's software was also designed towork closely with SunOS so that AViiONs and Suns can work together on Sunnetworks.andP;  The most important bit to know about the AViiON's operating systemand software is that it's 88open-compliant (see 88open boxout)andM;DG/UX comes with the popular Bourne and C shells, a C software developersenvironment and system administration utilities.andP;  DG has ruggedized the filessystem of DG/UX so that you don't have to resort to fschk very much.andP;  Theoperating system is fully capable of n-way symmetric multiprocessing,although this is so much excess baggage for the single processor AViiON.andO;There are lots of SNA extensions if you fancy a chat with a friendly IBMmainframe.andM;The AViiON is obviously designed with a Graphical User Interface in mind, somost of the time I spent running the AViiON was spent in the tender embraceof the X-Window System.andP;  To add a little excitement, I set up a network sothat a nearby PS/2 running AIX could share the fun.andM;Do you remember how long it took to set up your first network?andP;  Well, myfirst bash at linking Unix boxes took scarcely an hour (I did have somehelp).andP;  Reflect that the two machines I networked were from two differentcompanies, had wildly different processors and discordant flavours of Unixoperating systems.andP;  My hat's off to Ethernet, TCP/IP and the X-Window Systemwhich made it all possible.andP;  After a few tweaks, it did just what it wassupposed to.andM;In fact, the cover photo of X.desktop on the AViiON is somewhat misleading.andO;X.desktop was actually running over the network, it isn't a piece of softwarethat you can get just yet for the AViiON.andP;  Thanks to 88open, it may not belong, though.andM;While it's difficult to make subjective comparisons between different Unixoperating systems running on different architectures, the AViiON did seem tomove along a fair bit faster than the 25MHz 386 OS/2 under AIX at the otherend of the Ethernet cable.andM;The screen was brilliant.andP;  Everyone who saw it in action wanted oneimmediately.andP;  The other user interfaces, the ATE-compatible keyboard andthree-button mouse were of equally high quality, although I admit that Ifavour roller ball mouses over the optical type which DG supplies.andM;Entry level for the AViiON workstation comes with a 16.7MHz processor, 4Mb ofmemory,a  20-inch 1,280x1,024 monochrome monitor, keyboard and mouse and ispriced at a trim 5,767 pounds.andP;  A colour system (19-inch) with 8Mb of memorybut otherwise identical to the mono system costs 6,696 pounds.andM;The AViiON's sidekick storage box with a 180Mb disk will set you back anadditional 2,719 pounds.andP;  Another 1,307 pounds is required to pry a 150Mbtape drive out of DG's warehouse.andP;  The review package that I had for fourdelicious weeks would go out the door for no less than 17,791 pounds,including 620 pounds for the software.andP;  DG's big claim to fame is its priceper mip.andP;  It does have a point.andP;  I was button-holed by an adrenalin-pumped DGsales-type on the floor of last spring's Comdex with the slogan '$500 permip'.andP;  When he told me the price I thought it was just for the monitor!andM;By the time you've added a keyboard with a pound sign and paid thetransatlantic freight and duty, that translates to 340 pounds per mip for theentry level system, less drive box.andP;  For the colour outfit, that rises to 400pounds per mip.andP;  Compare this with an HP Vectra 486 PC that costs 833 poundsper mip, diskless and monitorless.andM;Given the quality of the machine, the excellent support you can expect fromDG and the flood of 88open software soon to appear (see 88open boxout), thismakes the AviiON nothing less than the best computer bargain of 1990 - unlessCompaq, IBM, HP et al cut their 486 prices in half!andP;  Fat chance.andM;The AViiON 300 workstation reviewed here is to be the mid point of DG'sintended workstation range.andP;  It's not too hard to guess what directions otherdevelopments might take.andP;  For a higher high-end, Motorola announced a 33MHzversion of the 88000 just before the end of last year, rated at 28mips.andP;  Thechip is sampling now, so machines will probably be available by summer.andM;The lower end growth path could be very intiguing for PC users.andP;  The current16MHz version could slide down the price list.andP;  With perhaps a smallermonitor, it could do well to drive deep into the heart of 386/486 PCterritory with a 3,000 pounds price tag.andM;Provided that you can get the DTP, CAD or office automation software that youneed to use, why not have a 17 mips high-resolution PC (pronouncedworkstation) sitting on your desk for little more than half the price of anIBM PS/2 Model 70 486 that delivers only half of the performance?andM;AViiON 300 - PC compatibilityandM;Strictly speaking, the AViiON has zero PC compatibility.andP;  The correspondencebetween the Motorola 88000 and the Intel 80xxx family extends only to thefact that they're both made out of silicon.andP;  So a software solution wasdeveloped.andM;Phoenix, the BIOS compatibility company, has furnished Data General with asoftware-only 80286/DOS emulation program, OpenPC.andP;  DG recommends 12Mb of RAMbut I wasn't able to lay my hands on a suitable floppy disk drive.andP;  Until DGcan supply the floppy disk drives, the Ethernet or tape catridge drive arethe only ways in.andM;OpenPC simulates the 101 ATE keyboard, a Microsoft bus mouse, two serial andthree printer ports, two 20Mb Winchesters and a pair of floppy disk drives.andO;The emulation software also impersonates an 80286, an 80287 floating pointco-processor and LIM 4.0 memory.andP;  Video modes are restricted to Hercules, MDAand CGA.andM;My New Year's resolution to eschew beta software was arguably left intact bythe OpenPC package DG arranged for my review.andP;  It was an alpha version.andM;On OpenPC I was able to run Microsoft Word and 1-2-3.andP;  dBase III Plus issupposed to be a goer, too, but I didn't have a copy to try.andM;Superkey got a go, too, as did a handful of public domain programs.andP;  In fact,thanks to the multi-tasking wonderfulness of Unix, I got three of the DOSapplications running simultaneously.andP;  There were no problems, aside from thespeed.andM;How fast was it?andP;  Dreadful is the best description that can be used in afamily magazine.andP;  Needless to say, it's likely that the performance will bebetter once the debugging code is extracted and the final release is tunedfor speed.andM;You shouldn't get too carried away by the prospect of multi-tasking DOS as aprimary use for the AViiON.andP;  The 286 emulation is very CPU intensive and withmore than three DOS windows it will grind to a stop.andP;  X-Window can co-existon the screen with OpenPC so that you can have a truly integrated DOS/Unixenviro.andM;It was so slow that I didn't even attempt to run the PC User benchmarks.andP;  Itwould have easily been the slowest PC we'd ever tested -- which wouldcertainly have been misleading.andM;RISC -- the speed connectionandM;In the relentless pursuit of computing performance, RISC (Reduced InstructionSet Computer) is the latest fashion in processor design.andP;  It's ushered in anew era of desktop machines, called workstations instead of PCs, that arefive to ten times faster than a 286 box.andM;The Intel chips that power DOS machines are examples of CISC (ComplexInstruction Set Computer) architectures.andP;  These chips include many complexinstructions that support high-level programming languages.andP;  Simpleinstructions can be executed in a single clock cycle; more-complex operationstake several cycles.andP;  For example, the 286 averages about six clock cyclesper instruction; the 386, around 4.4; the 486 just shy of two clocks.andM;The goal of RISC design is to have each instruction execute in a single clockcycle.andP;  To this end, the instruction set is reduced to the most commonly usedsimple instructions.andP;  If operations that involve only one instruction on aCISC processor require several instructions on a RISC machine, where's thegain?andM;RISC wins the race because its simplified design lends itself tooptimization.andP;  Pipelining, an 'assembly-line' technique where parts ofdifferent instructions are executed in parallel is RISC's main weapon againstthe CISC.andM;Before execution, a processor first fetches then decodes the instruction.andO;Pipelining allows one instruction to be executed while the next instructionis being decoded and the one after that is being fetched.andP;  The lockstepuniformity of instructions in RISC allows efficient synchronizing of theprocess.andM;Fast processors need fast memory access.andP;  Memory bottlenecks are addressed byRISC designers by using more registers (fast internal memory locations) thanCISC designers.andP;  They also rely on optimizing compilers to keep needed datain registers, keeping access to slow external system RAM to a minimum.andM;CISC applications typically use simple instructions most frequently.andP;  Inporting a program to RISC architecture, it may grow by a fifth, since certainCISC instructions, require several RISC instructions to make them equivalent.andO;An optimized RISC machine can average 1.3 clock cycles per instruction, whichis a lot faster than the fastest CISC so far.andP;  This clock-cycle efficiencymore than makes up for the increased in program length, resulting in asignificant speed gain over a CISC processor running at an equivalent clockrate.andM;There are a lot of big guns behind RISC now: Sun's SPARC (Scalable ProcessorARChitecture); MIPS, whose RISC chips are now being used by DEC, Sony, andothers; HP, which has done a deal with the Koreans for mass production; Inteland, of course, Motorola.andP;  Motorola has attracted quite a following includingDG, NCR, Tektronix, Stratus, Opus and Convergent Technologies.andP;  RISC machinesare now almost the exclusive province of Unix but Microsoft is making noisesabout porting OS/2.andM;It's safe to say that RISC will be playing a big part in the next step in PCevolution.andM;88open -- the software situationandM;In defence of the 486, I admit that there's a world full of software that PCusers will want to run on it.andP;  However, it's software that treats the 486like it was only a hyper fast 8086.andM;For the Unix operating system, the 88000 processor and machines like theAViiON to even hope for a fraction of the popularity that has accrued toIntel 32-bit processors, a big software push is needed.andM;That's where the Binary Compatibility Standard (BCS) of 88open comes intoplay.andP;  I have a book two inches thick of software of all types which is beingprepared to meet the BCS so that a single tape cartridge can be used to loadapplications into a dozen different makes of 88000 machines.andM;This is true shrink-wrapped Unix.andP;  The AViiON will be a primary beneficiaryof this wave of development.andM;So far, all big 4GLs (Informix, Oracle, Ingres and so on) have signed tosupport the AViiON.andP;  There will be Novell Netware, CAD, DTP and verticalmakret applications for law, manufacturing and office automation.andM;For more information about the 88open, see my Unix column in PC User, issue124.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
