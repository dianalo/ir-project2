<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-52-0991 </DOCNO><TEXT>Foraminifera are often found on petrographic slides of mudstones fromthe California Neogene, but the lack of a reference for identifying sectionedtests has made it impossible for these observations to yield much information.In a study of coastal outcrops of the Monterey Formation in the SantaMaria basin, this shortcoming was particularly evident, as many of theforaminiferal rocks are highly indurated and the specimens commonly aretoo eroded and fragile to survive conventional disaggregation procedures.Also, foraminifers encased as nuclei of phosphatic pellets remain obscuredin washed residues. In order to overcome these problems, well-preservedspecimens from coeval strata elsewhere (e.g., upper Newport Bay, NaplesBeach) were isolated, identified, and thin sectioned for comparison withthe specimens seen in petrographic slides derived from the Mussel Rock,Lions Head, and Boathouse Beach (Rodeo Canyon) sections. An innovativethin-sectioning technique devised for this analysis has been useful ininterpreting foraminiferal assemblages that are not readily extractedfrom the rocks.</TEXT></DOC>
