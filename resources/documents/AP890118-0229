Iran's official news agency, monitored in Nicosia, said a letterto the judiciary signed by 190 lawmakers read, ``It is in theinterest of the county to strengthen the judiciary as soon aspossible according to the leader of the Islamic revolution,Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.''   IRNA said the letter advised the judiciary to heed the warning,adding that failure to do so could cause irreparable harm.   The call reflects public concern over government graft and otherissues put to one side after the Iran-Iraq war began in September1980.   Parliament deputy Rajai Khorasani told students in northwesternTabriz province last month that corruption was a major reason forIran's agreeing to a U.N.-mediated cease-fire last August.   Last month Parliament came under attack for voting down a billdemanding that all government officials' incomes be investigated.   Members opposing the measure, among them Speaker HashemiRafsanjani, said it was too far-reaching in requiring thatmedium-level officials such as bank managers and heads ofstate-owned corporations be investigated.   In an effort to demonstrate a tough stand on corruption, however,the government last month sentenced multimillionaire Ali Mousavi todeath for defrauding war victims' families.   Also, an Expediency Council formed by Khomeini to expeditelegislation bypassed both judiciary and Parliament in passing adraconian law against drug smugglers.   The new law, to take effect at the end of this week, carries adeath sentence for anyone found in possession of more than 30 grams(just over one ounce) of specified hard drugs and 11 pounds of anynarcotic.   According to Tehran television reports, also monitored inNicosia, the public welcomed the crackdown.   Already, 75 people have been hanged in advance of the new law,and hundreds of tons of narcotics have been seized.</TEXT></DOC>
