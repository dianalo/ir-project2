Several illustrations of resonance averaging to problemsof nuclear structure and the distribution of radiative strength in nucleiare provided. The technique of resonance averaging has been shown tobe a useful tool for (n, {gamma}) research, particularly when care isapplied to the analysis to quantify the effect of the Purter Thomas fluctuationsof the contributing resonances. The method is able to locate ad placea complete set of states in a certain spinparity range. It can reliablyassign average transition strengths, separated according to multipolarity,and is an excellent way to determine radiative strength functions. 30refs.; 12 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
