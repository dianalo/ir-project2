The House will likely labor through next week on the workproduct of 11 committees, which might undergo major surgery frommore than three dozen amendments. Some proposed changes willprovide the most controversial moments of debate.   After a day devoted to debate and explanations of the bill'sprovisions, the House postponed votes on amendments until Thursday.   Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, has labeled the bill``bipartisan,'' a strategy that will allow incumbents of bothparties to claim credit for the politically popular legislationduring their re-election campaigns.   But the tactic also guarantees votes on Republican-inspiredamendments that would allow the federal death penalty fordrug-related killings, deny federal benefits to convicted drugusers and admit some illegally seized evidence in court.   The House took up the bill on Congress' first day back from amonth-long recess.   Other issues that lawmakers must settle before they quit nextmonth to campaign for re-election are spending levels for the StarWars anti-missile program, arms control issues, a major overhaul ofthe welfare system, competing proposals on child care and aid toNicaragua's Contra rebels.   Democrats may push for votes on their legislation to increasethe minimum wage from $3.35 per hour to $4.55 hourly over athree-year period, an increase opposed by President Reagan.   It was just two years ago that Congress passed its lastcomprehensive anti-drug bill, but lawmakers from both parties nowagree it failed to stem the tide.   ``I hope it does,'' Wright said when asked whether this measurewill have greater success. ``I don't know what else to do if itdoesn't.''   He said more treatment facilities and education are needed, andcalled local police ``ill-equipped and undermanned ... against druglords.''   The bill would increase spending for federal and state lawenforcement agencies to intercept illegal drugs on land, in the airand on the seas.   It would establish a seven-day waiting period for purchasing ahandgun, a provision that makes the legislation the latestlightning rod for the gun control debate.   Banking laws would be changed to try to stop the laundering ofdrug money at legitimate financial institutions. Education programswould be expanded for youth, including disadvantaged youngsters andthe most hardened gang members.   The bill encourages Latin American countries to form a regionalanti-narcotics force and pledges financial support if one isstarted.   Federal contractors would be required to maintain a drug-freeworkplace. Tight controls would be placed on the U.S.-madechemicals that are used to manufacture heroin, cocaine and otherdrugs.   States would be given money to develop programs to stop thespread of AIDS by intravenous drug abusers.   As debate began, the bill's Democratic floor manager, Rep.Charles B. Rangel of New York, urged colleagues to ``meet thechallenge'' of fighting illegal drugs.   While pledging not to discuss such issues as Vice PresidentGeorge Bush's role as Reagan's drug coordinator, Rangel accused theadministration of ``asking for severe cuts'' in the programsCongress approved as part of the 1986 anti-drug bill.   He also told the House: ``Don't allow the emotionalism ofamendments to distract from what we really have to do ... giveassistance to those people on the front line.''   Nonetheless, Rep. George Gekas, R-Pa., urged lawmakers tosupport his amendment for what he called ``the ultimate weapon''against drug traffickers _ the death penalty.   The proposal would permit capital punishment for anyone whointentionally kills a person while committing a federal drug felony.   Rep. William McCollum, R-Fla., will propose that the governmentdeny student loans, public housing, licenses and other benefits forfive years to those convicted of two or more drug-related offenseswithin a 10-year period; and for 10 years to those convicted ofdrug distribution.   McCollum also will propose that a portion of federal highwaymoney be withheld from states that do not require suspension orrevocation of drivers' licenses for those convicted of drug-relatedoffenses.   Rep. Dan Lungren, R-Calif., will try to win admission ofillegally seized evidence in federal cases if police made a searchwith the ``good faith'' belief they were acting constitutionally.   McCollum will attempt to strip from the bill a provision callingfor a seven-day waiting period for the purchase of a handgun,during which law-enforcement authorities could perform a backgroundcheck.   Employees and supporters of the National Rifle Associationcontacted lawmakers to oppose the provision while hundreds ofuniformed police officers supporting the delay roamed through theCapitol on Wednesday seeking support.   Meanwhile, Attorney General Richard Thornburgh told an executiveworking group on federal-state-local prosecutorial relations thatthe anti-drug bill has provisions that ``hold great potential,''but also has language that ``could hinder and obstruct'' lawenforcement efforts.   He said the administration supports the death penalty, but wantsto strengthen sections on the admission of evidence and launderingof ``ill-gotten gains.''</TEXT></DOC>
