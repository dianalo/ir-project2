It was then, he says, that residents of the Erbenheim neighborhood of Weisbaden began changing their minds about the U.S. army air base here. What had been tolerated as a noisy nuisance suddenly became a lethal threat.    Open rebellion followed this summer when the West German Defense Ministry announced that 39 U.S. Army helicopters were to be added to the Erbenheim base this month. Backed by the state of Hesse, the city of Wiesbaden secured a court order barring their arrival, citing laws on air-traffic congestion.    &quot;We're proud that competent people, including the courts, are finally acknowledging the problem and standing up to the federal government,&quot; exults Mr. Wick, the 62-year-old president of the Erbenheim community council. &quot;We feel betrayed by the politicians in Bonn and now want to find out if we are a satellite of the U.S. or a sovereign state. You hear it everywhere, it's come that far.&quot;    Ever since Germany was dismembered after World War II, West Germans have grudgingly accepted an assemblage of armed might that makes their territory one of the most militarized in the world. But recent disarmament initiatives from Moscow and a rising incidence of military aircraft crashes -- culminating with the tragic air show accident on Aug. 28 at the Ramstein U.S. air force base, which killed at least 64 people, 57 of whom were Germans -- have brought the issue into sharp relief.    Sovereignty, long a smoldering concern, has become a red-hot topic, and raises the likelihood that West Germany will increasingly challenge U.S. defense initiatives. While Germany's membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is unquestioned, the shift in public opinion may make its participation less enthusiastic.    The Erbenheim helicopter dispute underscores this trend. The case could wind up setting important legal precedents. Already, the German court's decision has limited Bonn's ability to comply with the wishes of its U.S. allies.    And Ramstein could become a rallying cry for greater German self-control over its territory. &quot;Ramstein elevated the public's consciousness,&quot; says Meinhard Miegel, director of the Institute for Economic and Social Policy, a Bonn think tank. &quot;It underscored that the Allies still retain certain rights and privileges and that could lead to more irritation and unrest.&quot;    Against this background, the steady flow of force-reduction initiatives from Moscow has eroded public support for defense measures. During the worst frosts of the Cold War, most West Germans were comforted by the arsenal around them. Now, a large majority, swayed by Mikhail Gorbachev's charm offensive, has a more benign view of the Soviet Union. A poll last month by the Infas Institute in Bonn found that 94% of the German public considers a Soviet attack against Western Europe unlikely or very unlikely.    Soviet-German relations have rarely been warmer as hundreds of thousands of ethnic Germans from the Soviet Union and other East bloc countries emigrate to West Germany this year. West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher is openly pressuring the U.S. to follow up on Soviet overtures for a mutual reduction of conventional forces in Europe, an issue likely to come up between Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Mr. Gorbachev during their Oct. 24 summit in Moscow.    The summit will take place as the Bonn parliament considers the lessons to be learned from the Ramstein disaster. The special status of the more than 900 U.S. military installations in West Germany is guaranteed by treaty, and so far U.S. officials don't detect any desire by West Germany to alter these documents.    But Ramstein could be a windfall for the opposition Social Democrats in their bid to regain national power in the 1990 election. Party leader Hans-Jochen Vogel, sounding what is certain to become a campaign slogan, says the lower house of parliament must study &quot;whether Germans should have the final word about what happens on their territory.&quot;    Even when things run smoothly, the huge NATO military machine can be a burden. Packed into West Germany -- an area the size of Oregon -- are nearly one million troops, 10,000 battle tanks, 1,650 helicopters, 1,600 fighter jets and 3,500 artillery pieces. Between 1980 and 1985, maneuvers by armored vehicles caused more than $540 million in property damage-flattened fences, crushed cars, chewed-up roads and fields -- for which West Germans were usually reimbursed.    But the airplane accidents have ignited public opinion. So far this year, 18 NATO fixed-wing aircraft have crashed in West Germany, bringing the total number to 133 since 1980. The danger of plummeting military planes seems very real compared to the more theoretical threat posed by the stationing here earlier of U.S. Pershing 2 nuclear missiles. As a result, opposition to low-level flying is gaining a grass-roots support that the anti-missile movement never had. According to an Infas poll last April, 62% of the public thinks such training flights should be banned altogether in West Germany.    And nowhere is public opinion more inflamed than in Erbenheim. The helicopter dispute there has put the new defense minister, Rupert Scholz, in the hot seat. The Wiesbaden court ruled that in clearing the U.S. plan to station the helicopters there, Mr. Scholz sought to subvert air-traffic laws that seek to reduce collision risks. Worse, the court accused the defense ministry of imposing &quot;occupational thinking&quot; on the local citizens.    Mr. Scholz is likely to appeal to a higher court. Meanwhile, a new community group in Wiesbaden, headed by the mayor, Achim Exner, is writing letters to Richard Burt, the U.S. ambassador to Germany; to U.S. army headquarters in Heidelberg; and to the Pentagon demanding that the plan to station the helicopters be dropped.    &quot;We can't defend freedom by endangering civil safety,&quot; Mayor Exner says. &quot;The broader aspect of the Erbenheim question is: How sovereign is the Federal Republic and to what extent are the Americans prepared to honor German law?&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
