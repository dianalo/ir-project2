About $50 million of long-term debt was affected. The rating agency said the main reasons for the downgrade were the effect of the bank's recent acquisition of Metropolitan Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, Bethesda, Md., and recent balance sheet mix changes prompted by rapid loan and large liability growth. Moody's said the purchase of Metropolitan has significantly reduced the Baltimore, Md.-based bank's risk adjusted capitalization. It also expects the acquisition to lower the bank's return on assets in the intermediate term. Harry L. Robinson, chairman and chief executive officer of Baltimore Bancorp, said that the downgrading was &quot;modest&quot; and that the bank had expected it after the Metropolitan acquisition. The purchase, however, is &quot;going very well,&quot; he said.    ---   M/A-COM INC. -- Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. said it lowered the company's triple-B senior debt to triple-B-minus, and triple-B-minus subordinated debt to double-B-plus. More than $90 million of debt is affected. The issues were removed from CreditWatch where they were placed Oct. 2 with negative implications. The rating agency said the downgrade reflects the effect of a &quot;substantial decline in debt capacity and equity in 1987, following a major stock repurchase program and write-offs from restructuring.&quot; Sandamp;P said Burlington, Mass.-based M/A-Com, which makes telecommunications and satellite equipment, &quot;does maintain adequate liquidity and ability to meet funding needs over the intermediate term.&quot; A M/A-Com spokesman said the company anticipates a return to profitability in the first quarter and &quot;continues to maintain a strong financial position with cash and marketable securities in excess of our outstanding indebtedness.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
