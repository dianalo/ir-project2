Although the image quality of the arterial or capillaryphase was inferior to that of conventional angiography with iodinatedcontrast media, the detectablity of arterio-venous shunting was excellent.In fact, DSA with CO/sub 2/ revealed the presence of A-V (A-P) shuntin 26 patients (26/41:63.4 % HCC, 13/15:86.7% metastatic liver tumor,2/3:66.7 % RCC, 1/5:20 %). On the other hand, conventional angiographywas able to show in only 5 cases. DSA with CO/sub 2/ will become an effectivemethod for detecting minute arterio-venous shunting which can not bedemonstrated with conventional angiography.</TEXT></DOC>
