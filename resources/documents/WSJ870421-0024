Mr. Hyman, 59 years old, admitted that he and certain co-conspirators bought and sold the two companies' stocks through about 53 accounts at 18 brokerage firms.    The transactions, the government had charged, were part of a scheme to &quot;create the illusion of widespread ownership and interest&quot; in the two stocks, artificially inflating their prices.    U.S. District Judge Charles S. Haight accepted Mr. Hyman's plea to one count of conspiracy and one count of wire fraud, which together carry a maximum 10 years' in prison and $500,000 in fines. Mr. Hyman is scheduled to be sentenced June 15. </TEXT></DOC>
