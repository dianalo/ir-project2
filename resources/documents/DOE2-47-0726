Fluorination of Ba{sub 2}YCu{sub 3}O6.92 affords a nominalcomposition of BaYCu{sub 3}O6.4F1.3 and Tc(onset) = 92K. Fluorinationof Ba{sub 2}YCu{sub 3}O6.15 gives a nominal composition of Ba{sub 2}YCu{sub3}O4.7F3.0, which is not superconducting to 4.2K. Fluorinated pelletsappear to be single-phase as determined by x-ray powder diffraction.However, Raman, NQR, ESR, x-ray diffraction, and TEM data suggest thatfluorine is not incorporated into the superconducting phase, but ratheris incorporated into a secondary amorphous phase.
