Analysts said a rebound in the Canadian dollar triggered apositive response in the bond and equity markets. Theypredicted that Canada's relatively attractive interest-rateyields will continue to support the Canadian dollar in comingweeks, overriding lingering anxieties about the future of theCanadian union.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The wide interest-rate spreads {between Canada and theU.S.} look ever more attractive now that the Canadian debateabout the Meech Lake accord has gone out of the air,&quot; saidEdward Carmichael, an economist at Burns Fry Ltd. in Toronto.   The Meech Lake accord, aimed at meeting demands of mostlyFrench-speaking Quebec and defusing independence forces inthe province, failed over the weekend after two provinciallegislatures adjourned without ratifying the proposedconstitutional amendment.   Yesterday, Montreal was a sea of blue-and-white Quebecflags as a good-natured crowd of about 200,000 watched aparade marking St. Jean Baptiste Day, the French-speakingprovince's &quot;national&quot; holiday. Lined up 10 deep in placesalong the three-mile route, Montrealers smiled and waved andat times chanted, &quot;We want a country. We want a country.&quot;   Canadian market sentiment was boosted by a report thatStandard andamp; Poor's Corp. affirmed its Triple-A rating onCanadian government debt and Double-A-minus rating onQuebec's debt. Moody's Investors Service Inc. also said itwould maintain its Double-A-3 rating on Quebec debt.   But Standard andamp; Poor's said it changed its outlook forQuebec's long-term debt to &quot;developing&quot; from &quot;positive&quot;because of political uncertainty. &quot;While Sandamp;P expects nochange in the relationship between Quebec and Canada in thenear term, ongoing discussions of constitutional reform couldbecome increasingly divisive,&quot; the rating agency said.   The Canadian dollar began the trading day in Asia, fallingswiftly to 84.20 cents from 84.85 cents late Friday inToronto. But it ended higher at 84.95 cents.   The Canadian 20-year bellwether bond ended down 1/2 point,or 50 Canadian dollars lower for every C$1,000 face amount,to 10.62%. But with U.S. bonds also falling, the Canadianissue improved against its American counterpart, narrowingits premium over the U.S. 30-year bellwether bond to 206basis points from 209 basis points on Friday. A basis pointis a hundredth of a percentage point.   Canadian equities also declined but by little more thanthe U.S. stocks measured by the Dow Jones Industrial Average.The Toronto Stock Exchange 300-composite index lost 16.56points to 3474.16 points. Volume was light at 15.5 millionshares.</TEXT></DOC>
