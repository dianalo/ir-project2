In an emotional speech to parliament, Najib urged lawmakers topromote peace by contacting guerrilla commanders in their provincesduring a two-month recess.   ``Make any contact with the opposition you want,'' Najib said.``You can choose your own forum. Give me one new proposal, give meany new proposal to solve this problem, and we will listen.''   Najib said he wanted a peace conference with Moslem guerrillasfighting the communist government, which took power in a 1978 coup.   The conference would set up a council to oversee a cease-fireand draft a new constitution, he said. It would then overseegeneral elections and the formation of a new government, he said.   Najib has said he would step down to end the war, which hasclaimed more than 1.3 million lives and sent 5 million of the 15million pre-war population fleeing to neighboring countries.   Najib's latest peace overtures were directed toward theguerrilla field commanders operating inside Afghanistan.   On Sunday, the president urged commanders to break with theirexiled leaders in Pakistan and Iran. In return, he said, they wouldreceive full military rank within the Afghan army, would be allowedto keep their weapons and would have full autonomy in the regionsthey control.   Najib named commanders he hoped would accept his offer,including Akmed Shah Masood, Ismail Khan and Abdul Haq, who areknown for their struggle against the government and Soviet troops.The last of the Red Army soldiers left Kabul on Feb. 15, ending anine-year intervention.   But the latest offer was rejected flatly and quickly, Najib said.   ``The commanders have reacted negatively to positive proposalsand I think they have made a major historical error,'' he said.``You could have united the country but now you are dividing it.''   Najib blamed the guerrilla leaders based in Peshawar, Pakistan,for hindering efforts toward a negotiated settlement.   ``What do they know about bloodshed inside this country?'' hesaid. ``We want to stop the flames of war, but they want tocontinue war. They are saying take weapons, take rockets anddestroy our cities.''   Diplomats in Kabul said they doubted commanders would accept acease-fire before the end of the summer, when most of the fightingoccurs. Commanders seem content to see if an outright militaryvictory is possible, they said.   Iran-based guerrilla leaders said they had rejected aninvitation to visit Moscow for peace talks, according to theofficial Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Cyprus.   The offer from Yuli Vorontsov, first deputy foreign minister ofthe Soviet Union, ``was refused immediately,'' said Ali Jan Zahedi,spokesman for the guerrilla coalition.   In Pakistan, the U.N. High Commission for Refugees said anincreasing number of refugees were returning to their war-ravagedhomes in southern Afghanistan. In early May, the flow of refugeesrose from about 15 families a week to more than 100 daily, thecommission said.   Sources said the return appeared influenced by lighter fightingin the south, weariness of camp life and the desire to plant springcrops.</TEXT></DOC>
