The fine against a division of the Lockheed Corp. was proposedFriday by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, whichalso announced it was launching a ``wall-to-wall'' inspection ofthe Burbank plant because of the alleged violations found during afour-month review of the stealth project.   Under OSHA procedures, Lockheed has 15 working days to contestthe proposed fine. Lockheed spokesman Jim Ragsdale said the companyhad no immediate comment and likely would not comment until itsmanagement had an opportunity to review the citations.   OSHA cited 251 instances in which it said Lockheed AeronauticalSystems Co. willfully failed to record illnesses and injuries toemployees and 88 alleged willful violations of federal regulationsrequiring employers to inform workers about the potential dangersof chemicals they work with and instruct them on proper safeguards.   In addition, the company was cited for another 99 violations ofvarious OSHA standards, including alleged mislabeling or failure tolabel chemical containers and alleged failure to include healthwarnings on information the company was required to provide to itsworkers.   Other alleged violations included failing to list suspectedcarcinogens on safety sheets provided to workers, overexposingworkers to asbestos and failure to provide workers with glovesimpervious to a hazardous chemical used on the fighter.   The proposed fine follows an OSHA inspection based on numerouscomplaints from workers at the plant, which employs about 14,000people.   In October, a month after the inspection began, John C.Brizendine, the president of the division, said: ``We have seennothing to indicate the materials we work with are fundamentallyunsafe or pose a health hazard, provided proper procedures arefollowed.''   A month later the government for the first time publiclyacknowledged the existence of the stealth fighter, a single-seat,dual-engine jet that resembles a bat and is formally designated theF-117A.   The Defense Department has ordered 59 stealth fighters; 52 hadbeen delivered as of the November showing.   Seventy-five employees at the plant have a suit pending againstLockheed and companies that make and supply the chemicals used tohelp the fighter avoid radar detection. More than 100 workers havefiled workers compensation claims alleging they suffer frominjuries caused by the chemicals.   The suit and the claims allege composite materials used in thefighter and chemicals used to mill and clean those materials causerashes, nausea, dizziness, memory loss and concentration problems.   OSHA spokesman Frank Kane said the fine represented theninth-largest in the agency's 17-year history and the largest everlevied in California. The record fine was $5.1 million against twocompanies involved in an April 1987 Bridgeport, Conn., buildingcollapse.</TEXT></DOC>
