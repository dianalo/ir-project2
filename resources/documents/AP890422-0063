(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two military space shuttle flightsplanned next summer will be delayed, one for at least three months,because work on the shuttle Columbia is taking longer than expected.   NASA said Friday the schedule had become too tight to supportboth missions and still preserve an October launch for thehigh-priority Galileo flight to Jupiter.   A Discovery launch that had been scheduled for Aug. 10 will bedelayed until at least November. Columbia, which had a July 1launch target, will be launched in early August, the space agencysaid.   Both missions are to deploy classified Defense Departmentpayloads.   Unaffected will be Friday's planned liftoff of Atlantis with theMagellan-Venus spacecraft on board, the first planet-bound payloadscheduled for release from a space shuttle.   The schedule changes will have a ripple effect on launch dateslater in the year, leaving NASA with six instead of its goal ofseven shuttle launches this year.   Officials have said the planned Oct. 12 liftoff of Atlantis withthe Jupiter-orbiting Galileo spacecraft is a high-priority flightbecause there is only a 40-day launch period during which Jupiterand Earth are aligned properly. So it will be next in line afterColumbia's August mission.   Then will come the delayed Discovery military flight, probablyin November, and a flight, probably in December, in whichColumbia's crew is to deploy a communications satellite andretrieve a science satellite which has been orbiting since 1984.   The mission of Discovery with the Hubble Space Telescope, longawaited by astronomers, will slip from its present December launchslot into 1990.   NASA said dates for missions after the Galileo flight will bedetermined later.   ``NASA management has become increasingly concerned that thework involved in preparing the orbiter Columbia for its firstflight in over three years is taking long enough that it mightendanger the option to launch Galileo at the opening of the launchwindow,'' said shuttle chief Richard H. Truly. ``Our overridingobjectives in this situation are to protect the Galileo window andto fly Columbia as early as we can.''   Following the Challenger explosion in January 1986, the shuttlefleet was grounded for 32 months while the three remaining orbitersunderwent major modifications to improve safety and performance.   The modified Discovery has made two flights since the accidentand Atlantis is about to make its second.   Besides the Challenger-dictated changes, Columbia, the firstshuttle and a veteran of seven space trips, also had to undergoextensive alterations to its thermal protection tile system and isthe last one to be returned to flight status.   The Columbia work is taking longer than planned because of ashortage of skilled engineers and technicians to process threeshuttles simultaneously.</TEXT></DOC>
