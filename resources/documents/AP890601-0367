The Labor Department's revised figures for the first threemonths of the year showed a 1.1 percent decline in non-farmbusiness productivity at an annual rate, down from the 0.5 percentgain reported in preliminary first-quarter data issued last month.   Unit labor costs _ a key determinant of overall inflation _ rosea revised 6.6 percent on an annual basis in the quarter, said thegovernment, which in the earlier report had pegged the increase at5.2 percent.   In other economic data Thursday, the government reported a slim,0.1 percent increase in construction spending in April after threestraight monthly declines. The improvement in that sector, amongthose hardest hit by higher interest rates, was attributed largelyto work on government projects.   The reports were in line with other data indicating asignificant slowdown in the rate of economic expansion in the firstquarter followed by somewhat improved growth in the first twomonths of the second quarter. Analysts expect Friday's unemploymentreport for May to put a more definitive stamp on second-quartertrends.   ``The economy is slowing down but it's certainly not stopping,''said chief economist David Wyss of DRI-McGraw-Hill of Lexington,Mass.   The 1.1 percent decline in productivity compared with a 1percent annual gain in the fourth quarter of 1988 and an overall1988 gain of 1.5 percent. It was the first decline in productivitysince a sharp drop of 2.4 percent on an annual basis in the secondquarter of last year. The revised data said the 1.1 percent declineresulted from a 2.2 percent increase in output but a greaterincrease, 3.4 percent, in the total hours worked.   The jump in unit labor costs was the biggest since the secondquarter of last year as well; the government at that time reporteda 6.8 percent increase on an annual basis. For all of 1988 unitlabor costs rose 3.1 percent.   The revised numbers were not entirely unexpected.   Last week's downward revision of the gross national product forthe first quarter brought predictions that the productivity gainreported in May's preliminary data was erroneous.   Still, the rate of decline was surprising to some analysts andof greater concern was the inflationary pressures demonstrated bythe big jump in labor costs.   ``The results are distinctly inflationary,'' said Allen Sinai,chief economist for Boston Co. Economic Advisers Inc. ``The truecore of inflation in the United States is really unit labor costs.... This is indeed a dismal statement and makes the outlook for aquick and accelerated reduction in inflation very, very poor.''   Analysts who for some time have been raising alarms aboutsluggish productivity gains took Thursday's report as furtherevidence that major reductions in the trade deficit will not comeuntil U.S. business makes a substantial commitment to improvingproductivity, which in turn would reduce unit labor costs.   At the same time, however, they said declining productivity asreported Thursday would slice profit margins and make business lesswilling to make capital investments in equipment and trainingneeded to bolster productivity. And they said pressure on profitswould trigger price increases and exacerbate inflationary pressures.   ``Lack of productivity is one of the major problems in thiscountry,'' said Washington-based economist Michael Evans. ``This isnot the first bad report we've had although it's the worst in sometime. ... The inflationary pressures are starting to creep upagain.''   Sinai said the continued evidence of inflationary pressureslikely would convince Federal Reserve policy-makers to continue thecentral bank's current tight rein on credit despite growingpressure to ease.   Also in the productivity report was evidence that wage gainsmade by American workers are being wiped out by consumer priceinflation.   The Labor Department said average hourly pay climbed 5.4 percenton an annual basis in the first quarter. But real hourlycompensation _ wage gains minus consumer price inflation _ wasunchanged compared with the fourth quarter of 1988.   The Commerce Department's report on construction activity saidspending on both public and private construction projects rose to aseasonally adjusted annual rate of $414.9 billion in April afterdropping 0.3 percent in March, 0.6 percent in February and 0.7percent in January.   The January-March string of declines had marked the first timeconstruction spending dropped three times in a row since it fellfor five straight months from February through June 1981, justbefore the start of the 1981-82 recession.</TEXT></DOC>
