 It allows Unixsystems to exploit the availability and reliability of VAXcluster systemsusing TCP/IP.andP;  Part of this software includes support within VMS forcommunication protocols traditionally found only on Unix systems, includingHP/Apollo's NCS, Routing Information Protocol (RIP), and BSD Internet NameDomain Resolver (BIND).andM;SECURITY.andP;  Security under Ultrix 4.0 has been brought up to C2 level.andP;  Whilethis is a good start, we expect that Digital will be under increasingpressure to surpass C2 and aim for B1 or B2.andM;OTHER ENHANCEMENTS.andP;  Digital has increased the number of disks supported from32 to 96 per system (for up to 144 GB of storage).andP;  Inclusion of SQL run-timelibraries is an operating system feature.andP;  This is expected to encouragedevelopers to write to Ultrix because the developer does not have to purchasethe run-time SQL library.andM;Database Access.andP;  Database access has been a weakness for Digital--especiallyin the Unix arena.andP;  Although Digital says it will develop a version of Rdbfor Ultrix, it has been slow to provide that functionality.andP;  But, because ofcompetitive pressures, Digital has hired Ingres to develop a relational SQLengine that can provide remote access to Rdb on VMS.andP;  Ingres also providesDigital with sorely needed front-end tools.andP;  As a marketing move, Digital isincluding Ingres's SQL run-time engine at no additional cost.andM;The downside of Digital's arrangement with Ingres is that it alienates otherrelational database vendors.andP;  We suspect that Informix, Sybase, andOracle--to name a few--will not be pleased with this cozy partnership.andO;Digital might have been wiser to pick an object database and allow anyrelational database to hook in.andM;Digital's next move in the database arena will be to provide its Builderproduct for Ultrix.andP;  Builder is a tool to allow users to define relationshipsamong data elements from multiple data sources.andP;  It inlcludes tools forcreating cross-application macros.andP;  Because it relies on Rdb, this powerfultool is available only on VMS today.andM;System Management.andP;  Although Digital is not licensing Apollo's LicenseBroker, it is providing software management tools to customers.andP;  Digital alsohas introduced Diskless Management Service (DMS) and the Remote InstallationService (RIS) to allow a single system to service both RISC and VAX systemsat the same time.andP;  The RIS server, for example, performs the boot request onthe local Ethernet and uses NFS to access RIS files on the full RIS server,as well as facilitating remote installations across gateways and wide areanetworks.andM;Unlike some of the operating systems available from other vendors, Digital OSfor workstations (called Ultrix Workstation Software) bundles in a lot ofgood technology, including DECwindows, Adobe Display Post-Script, Digital'sCompound Document Architecture (CDA) libraries, DECnet, TCP/IP, NFS, a &quot;quickscreen refresh for overlapped windows,&quot; and support for monochrome,gray-scale, four-plane and eight-plane color systems.andP;  All of these areprovided standard with the hardware.andP;  Digital is also preloading theoperating system onto all the workstations it sells.andP;  This action is gearedto helping Digital complete in the commercial Unix market.andM;OFFICE SOFTWARE.andP;  Digital is not ready with its home-grown Unix officeproducts.andP;  In the meantime, it is offering two popular packages: Uniplex forthe multiuser systems and Applix's Alis for workstation users.andP;  Both productswill fill a gap.andP;  Digital already has its DECwrite compound document editoravailable under Ultrix.andP;  In addition, DECwindows already provides a good setof facilities including calendar, mail, and a draw and paint program.andP;  Thiscould be the basis for a respectable office package.andM;ConclusionandM;At a recent consultant's briefing when these systems were reviewed, Digital'smanagement stated that the company's goal is to become the number one vendorof open systems in the '90s by delivering &quot;leadership RISC workstations.&quot;andP;  Itis a lofty goal and one that will find some customers scratching their heads.andO;Conventional wisdom says that Digital isn't very interested in the overallUnix market.andM;Speeches from company guiding light Ken Olsen help keep that perceptionalive.andP;  If one listens closely to what Olsen says, he makes some excellentpoints and philosophical observations about Unix and the confusion over theterm &quot;open.&quot;andP;  But it is inevitable that these talks will be misinterpreted.andO;The business press is as interested in &quot;sound bites&quot; as the rest of thegeneral press.andP;  Since Digital has no visible Unix spokesperson, any statementOlsen makes is taken the final word in corporate Unix strategy.andM;Digital has an incredible wealth of technology and know-how in both generalcomputing and Unix.andP;  The commpany's biggest problem is that it assumes thatif it engineers good systems and software, customers will find out.andP;  It'ssomewhat like the old saying, &quot;goodness is its own reward.&quot;andP;  Unfortunatelyfor Digital, in the cutthroat workstation and systems marketplace, goodnessisn't always appreciated.andP;  Especially when the goodness is buried deeply sothat customers don't even know what Digital has to offer them.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
