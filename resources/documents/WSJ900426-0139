A retired military pilot, Mr. Ryzhak, 67 years old, isfit and suntanned; several gold teeth gleam in his smile. Hecomes to this gigantic, decrepit, heated outdoor pool at thefoot of the Kremlin wall every day it is open, even in thedead of winter.   In summertime, the pool is closed for repairs. Insubfreezing weather, Mr. Ryzhak and some 8,000 otherMuscovites use it each day. When the temperature rises abovefreezing, the number swells to 15,000.</LP><TEXT>   In a city where winter offers little recreation, this is asimple pleasure, and good for you, too, Russians say. Buthistory has complicated it. The pool happens to occupy thebasement of what was once the magnificent Christ the SaviorCathedral, dynamited on Joseph Stalin's orders 59 years ago.Now, the Russian Orthodox Church and many devout privatecitizens, all enjoying greater religious freedom underMihkail Gorbachev, want to get rid of the pool and rebuildthe cathedral.   The reconstruction movement has created a passionatedebate, tinged with re-emergent Russian nationalism andDostoyevskian issues of morality and state -- or individual-- responsibility.   Mr. Ryzhak takes a pragmatic view. It costs only 50kopeks, or 80 cents, to use the pool, a sauna and shower,and, he says, &quot;We are paupers. There are so many other thingsto worry about.&quot; As to responsibility for the cathedral'sfate, he says, &quot;It's the system, not the fault of thepeople.&quot;   Another swimmer, Ada Budkevich, a buxom, 55-year-oldbuilding engineer, says that because the old cathedral couldnever be precisely replicated, the money should be spent on&quot;all the things that are falling to pieces elsewhere.&quot; Still,Ms. Budkevich confesses to &quot;a certain guilty feeling becauseeverybody had a hand in what was done to the church.&quot;   Other swimmers gather to argue. &quot;It is extremely importantto raise the moral value of the society,&quot; says Nina Bourkina,a cathedral partisan.   &quot;It's not for nothing that this place was chosen for thecathedral,&quot; says Marina Ignatava, a slender 30-year-old in abikini. &quot;I can find another place to swim.&quot;   Articles on the cathedral have appeared regularly inMoscow newspapers. A TV station has broadcast a 12-minutedocumentary showing the church's demolition. A conservativenationalist newspaper, Literaturnaya Rossiya, has launched afundraising drive for the cathedral, and cash has come fromsupporters rich and poor.   Several benefit concerts by well-known Russian singershave been held here. Money may even come from America; ArkadyNebolsin, of New York, president of the American Society forthe Preservation of Monuments and Culture in Russia, says thegroup will begin a fund drive.   &quot;It is a signal of common grief and the necessity to pleadguilty to what we have done to ourselves,&quot; Bishop Vladimir ofthe Orthodox Church's Moscow diocese says of thereconstruction movement.   Built in the late 19th century to commemorate the Russianvictory over Napoleon, the cathedral was an architecturalmasterpiece of gilded cupolas, imported marbles and frescoesthat took 40 years and 15 million rubles to complete. Somecalled it the eighth miracle of the world.   Stalin, during an anti-religious campaign, decided thesite would be good for a state Palace of Soviets. At noon onDec. 5, 1931, shortly after the cathedral's chimes rang forthe last time, it was dynamited, and collapsed in a mushroomcloud of dust. The Soviet government is said to have salvagedthe gold from the cupolas and appropriated some of thefrescoes, which now reside in a state museum.   The basement was enlarged for the planned palace. When theland proved too swampy for such a huge structure, thebasement was tiled and turned into a swimming pool -- asunken circle of now-cracked tiles six times the size of astandard Olympic pool.   The campaign to rebuild the church is based in the tiny,cluttered office of Yuri Yushkin, the editor of LiteraturnayaRossiya. Sitting at his desk amid piles of yellowingnewspapers, he says the pool sits at Russia's spiritualcenter. The cathedral was a history text, he says, its wallsbearing the names of heroes in Russia's 1812 victory overNapoleon. Its name evoked the belief that Christ saved Russiafrom the invasion. So the pool is sacrilegious, he says --and &quot;a most disgraceful and dirty thing to have right thereat the Kremlin wall.&quot;   So far, 468,000 rubles have been raised toward a goal of200 million rubles, or $320 million. Mr. Yushkin reads someof the messages that donors have written: &quot;Let my drop enterthe sea,&quot; says &quot;Slave Alexandra,&quot; of the Tambouv region, whosends 10 rubles. &quot;Here is my month's salary,&quot; says JuliaManko of Donetsk, who sends 365 rubles. A Mr. Kibetz, ofMagadan, includes words of a prayer with his 50 rubles.   Mr. Yushkin believes the cathedral could be rebuilt by2012, bicentennial of Napoleon's retreat. Large problemsloom, however. Mr. Yushkin thinks their resolution will provethe sincerity of Mr. Gorbachev's program for a freer society.   The land belongs to the government. A special decree wouldbe required to return it to the church. The Supreme Sovietand the Council of Ministers haven't even responded to achurch request for permission to begin rebuilding -- muchless promised money for it, as Mr. Yushkin and churchofficials would like. If the government denies permission,the church plans to appeal to Mr. Gorbachev.   Christ the Savior must also compete for money with anotherchurch project, already approved by the government,commemorating the Christianization of Russia a thousand yearsago.   And then there are the swimming pool partisans to contendwith. Nikolai Portnov, the gray-haired pool director, callscathedral reconstruction &quot;a utopian idea. Of course it is sadand bad that the cathedral was brought down, but since thepool exists and is so popular, what is the point of bringingit down, too?&quot;   Mr. Portnov has his own dream for the pool site:rebuilding it as part of a first-class sports and recreationarea. He says the disrepair of the pool embarrasses him; thesaunas are dark and moldy and the spartan locker roomsfilthy. An architect's rendering of a proposed renovationhangs on his office wall. The design was commissioned by theMoscow city government in 1981 and approved in 1985. A newcity government dropped the project in 1986.   The church was the stumbling block, says Yuri Knyazev, aMoscow sports-facility official. The Moscow City Council, hesays, sees no point in spending money on the pool if it is tobe closed and the land given back to the church. The Sovietgovernment already has returned more than 3,000 cathedralsand other properties to the church.   Mr. Portnov says he has heard nothing from cathedralpromoters, but he did meet some recent visitors who, becauseof the sanctity of the site, came to be baptized in the pool.Mr. Portnov finds the spiritual mystique of the place a bitstrange. Gesturing toward the hundreds of swimmers bobbing inthe pool's greenish water with their brightly colored bathingcaps, he says: &quot;This is a far cry from the Ganges River.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
