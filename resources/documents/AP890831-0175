The goal is ``to monitor, understand and, ultimately, predictglobal change,'' said Robert Post of the Office of Science andTechnology Policy.   ``Global change is a large, complex scientific problem and itstill is not largely understood,'' said Dallas Peck, director of theU. S. Geological Survey and chairman of the federal Committee onEarth Science, which is coordinating the research effort.   ``There is a shared, common purpose; to understand global change.We're in the planning stages,'' added Dixon Butler of the NationalAeronautics and Space Administration.   The effort announced Thursday covers the coming fiscal yearbeginning Oct. 1. Peck described it as largely a planning period tobe used setting up research programs likely to last a decade or more.   The atmosphere and the role of clouds received top priority in inthe program. Michael Hall of the National Oceanic and AtmosphericAdministration said clouds are a major factor in the feared rise inglobal temperatures, and their effect is not well understood.   The widely discussed threat of global warming, however, is onlypart of the overall research effort. The studies also will look atthreats to the earth's protective ozone layer, possible changes inthe oceans and atmosphere, air pollution, acid rain and otherprocesses.   Reports of warmer temperatures have drawn the most attentionrecently. Some scientists are concerned that carbon dioxide andother gases added to the atmosphere by human activities are causingthe higher temperatures and tha eventually they might lead todisruptive climate changes.   Other scientists dispute the so-called greenhouse effect, andevidence is lacking on both sides. That is an area the researchershope to tackle early.   Funds totaling $191.5 million for fiscal 1990 are included in thebudgets of various departments to get the program under way, saidBob Corell of the National Science Foundation. In January thecommittee will put together requests for funds for 1991 and futureyears, he said.   The seven major areas of research set forth Thursday are:   _Climate and hydrologic systems. The role of clouds is the firstitem on the agenda, followed by research in ocean circulation, andinteraction of the air land and water.   _Biogeochemical dynamics: the relationship between livingorganisms and the water and atmosphere. For example, trees takecarbon dioxide out of the air and replace it with oxygen. Cuttingdown trees reduces that activity.   _Ecological systems and dynamics: how people, plants and animalswould react to climate change and how those reactions might in turnaffect other processes.   _Earth system history: what has happened to the land, air andwater when climate has changed in the past.   _Human interactions: population growth and development, energyand land use and industrial production and how those activitiesaffect the earth.   _Solid earth research: coastal erosion, volcanoes and theireffect on climate, permafrost, the seafloor and other areas.   _Solar influences: monitoring incoming radiation from the sun,the amount reflected back into space and how this energy affects theearth and its climate.   In addition to the Geological Survey, NASA and NOAA, otheragencies in the program are the State Department, EnvironmentalProtection Agency, Department of Transportation, Department ofAgriculture, Council on Environmental Quality and the Department ofDefense.</TEXT></DOC>
