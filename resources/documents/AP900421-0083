(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jeff Johnson told classmates he wastaking a senior from out of town to the high school prom. He didn'ttell them that ``senior'' was his grandmother.   All eyes were on Johnson and his grandmother, Julia Burris, 78,of Park River, when they arrived at the prom with 34 other couplesFriday night. They had a great time _ dining, dancing, and cruisingMain Street in Bismarck about 30 miles away.   ``It was wonderful,'' Mrs. Burris said Saturday. ``Nobodyfainted when I walked in, and they were all very nice and friendly.I really enjoyed it.''   She and her grandson danced the first dance because the musicwas slow, she said.   ``I didn't want to look ridiculous doing a fast one, so we leftright after that,'' she said.   ``We went to Bismarck for supper and then we cruised MainStreet. We had fun. I didn't feel my age, that's for sure.''   In Maud, Okla., Eric Bundy went one better and asked his greatgrandmother, Nettie Crawford, 77, to go with him to his junior promSaturday night.   ``My great grandpa died in November. She's all alone now. Shedoesn't get out much, maybe just to go to Seminole or something.''Maud is about 15 miles from Seminole and 60 miles southeast ofOklahoma City.   Bundy was nervous about telling ``the guys.'' But ``they allthought it was pretty neat,'' he said. ``Nobody has ever done itbefore.''   Johnson said he decided to ask his grandmother to the prombecause she won't be able to attend his May 20 graduation becauseof the graduation the same day of another grandchild.   ``I was thinking of being a little different,'' he said. ``Andthen my grandma's not going to be able to come down for graduation,so I figured she could come for the prom, the next best thing.''   Mrs. Burris said at first she thought he was kidding.   ``Are you sure you want to do that,'' she said she asked severaltimes. Friends ``gave me a little more courage,'' when they toldher it was an honor to be invited.   Johnson is president of his school's National Honor Society, amember of its wrestling and track teams, and plays in the band.   ``It's really funny how much people assume,'' Johnson said.   When friends asked whether he and his date had a seriousrelationship, he replied:   ``She's pretty special to me.''</TEXT></DOC>
