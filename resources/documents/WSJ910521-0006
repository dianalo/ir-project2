GCA, the leading U.S. manufacturer of such devices forprinting circuits on semiconductor wafers, is to take thewraps off its new XLS model today at a semiconductorequipment show in San Mateo, Calif.</LP><TEXT>   GCA President Peter Simone said the XLS is the product ofa collaborative effort by the U.S. semiconductor industry tostrengthen one of its critical sectors. He said GCA spent&quot;tens of millions of dollars&quot; developing the new stepper,which is designed to produce the next generation ofultra-dense computer chips at high volumes. But he alsoacknowledged the financial help of Sematech, thePentagon-funded research consortium, and the technicalassistance of several U.S. semiconductor makers that could beamong the XLS's future buyers.   Mr. Simone said U.S. chip makers sent their engineers toGCA's Andover, Mass., plant to advise how the machine shouldbe designed for easy handling.   Sematech President William Spencer said the stepper has ahigh-resolution lens and a high-intensity lamp that enable itto print three-dimensional circuits as tiny as 0.35 micron,or 35 thousandths of a millimeter. Such precision is neededto produce the 64-megabit dynamic random access memories thatthe computer industry will need in a few years.   GCA used to be the undisputed leader in optical wafersteppers. But in recent years it has lost ground to NikonCorp. and Canon Inc., both of Japan, which together controlsome 65% of the world market.</TEXT></DOC>
