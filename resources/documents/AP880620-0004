The officials, who insisted on anonymity, said a ``high-levelmeeting'' was held Monday afternoon to discuss whether the Pentagonemployees should be suspended or moved to other jobs. The sourcesdeclined to say whether Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci sat inon the meeting, but said a final decision was expected afteranother meeting Tuesday morning.   ``They should have something to announce tomorrow,'' said onesource. ``The lawyers have been doing a lot of work.''   The New York Times reported in Tuesday's editions that Pentagonofficials said Monday that the Defense Department officials underscrutiny would be transferred to less sensitive jobs until theinvestigation was completed.   Monday's meeting came less than a week after federalinvestigators served 38 search warrants on defense contractors,military consultants and Defense Department officials in connectionwith possible bribery and fraud in alleged leaks of classifiedcontracting infomation worth millions of dollars.   The U.S. attorney who is coordinating the investigation, HenryHudson of the eastern district of Virginia, said 270 subpoenas havebeen issued and that additional search warrants may be served.   In a Senate speech, Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, rebuked theJustice Department for halting 1985 testimony he said would haverevealed how defense contractors and private consultants wereillegally obtaining Pentagon weapons secrets. Attorney GeneralEdwin Meese III responded that the department has prosecuteddefense procurement cases vigorously and has never ``had to bedragged into any indictment where the evidence is there.''   Elsewhere, CBS News reported that three congressmen _ Reps.Thomas Downey, D-N.Y., Andrew Ireland, R-Fla., and Sam Stratton,D-N.Y. _ were under scrutiny in the case, but that there was notyet enough evidence to make them targets of the investigation. CBSsaid it got its information from law enforcement sources which itdid not identify. Downey's name had been mentioned first inMonday's editions of The Washington Times.   Spokesmen for Downey and Ireland said no government official hadcontacted either congressmen or their offices in connection withthe probe. Downey blasted as ``wholly incorrect'' the newspaperarticle linking him with the investigation. CBS News saidStratton's office also said it had not been contacted.   On other matters in connection with the probe, Meese refused tosay whether former Navy Secretary John Lehman Jr. was underscrutiny in the investigation. Two of his former close aides,Melvyn Paisley and retired Adm. James A. ``Ace'' Lyons have beenimplicated in the probe.   Meanwhile, The New York Times reported that three large militarycontractors _ Hercules Inc., Gould Inc. and the Electronic DataSystems Corp. _ said they had been served with subpoenas in theprobe. EDS spokesman Bill Wright told the newspaper that thecompany had been informed that it ``is not a target of the grandjury investigation.''   Among the five Pentagon officials under scrutiny in the probeare James Gaines, the deputy assistant Navy secretary foracquisition management, and Dr. Victor Cohen, the deputy assistantAir Force secretary in charge of buying tactical command, control,communications and computer systems. Cohen's office was searchedlast week.   The others include two Navy employees _ George Stone, anofficial in the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command, and StuartBerlin, an executive with the Naval Air Systems Command _ andMarine Corps official Jack Sherman, who works in the equipment andservice acquisition section of the contracts division, installationand logistics department.   ``They're trying to decide what to do with those (five) untilthe next shoe drops,'' said one official.   It could not be determined immediately Monday whether thePentagon also was considering suspending defense contractors frombidding on new contracts if they had been implicated in theinvestigation.   Grassley, in his Senate speech, told of an incident in October1985 when a Defense Department investigator about to testify on hisfindings concerning procurement corruption was stopped from doingso by a top Justice Department official who grabbed the microphoneaway from him.   The testimony would have revealed the contract briberyallegations that became public just last week, Grassley said.   Grassley, who was then chairman of a Senate Judiciarysubcommittee, said he halted the hearing after department officialVictoria Toensing interrupted the testimony of Pentagoninvestigator Robert Segal. She said he was about to touch on areasthat concerned criminal matters pending against GTE Corp.   ``I stopped the hearing at that point,'' Grassley said. ``I wishnow I hadn't. There wasn't anything in that testimony that couldhave jeopardized that case.   ``The public must be made aware of the fact that the JusticeDepartment was asleep at the switch,'' Grassley said, because itwas conducting a narrow investigation when Segal was findingwidespread abuse _ and possible bribery _ in defense procurement.   Attempts to contact Segal on Monday were unsuccessful.   Meese said a number of spinoff cases grew out of the GTE probewhich are being prosecuted. He did not identify them.   GTE Corp. was not among the defense contractors searched byfederal officials last week.   When asked about Segal's testimony that the department had notvigorously pursued the passing along of confidential information,Meese said that ``I can assure you that at no time has thisdepartment had to be dragged into any indictment where the evidenceis there.''   The attorney general said that since 1985, the defenseprocurement fraud unit has obtained some 43 indictments andcriminal informations in significant cases, has obtained 35convictions and has recovered some $32 million.   Segal worked for the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, andwas Pentagon liaison with the Justice Department's DefenseProcurement Fraud Unit, a special office established to investigatewaste in the military budget.   His testimony in 1985 would have said private consultantsregularly received classified Pentagon documents that should nothave been available outside the government, Grassley said.   According to Grassley, Segal planned to say that ``many of these(defense) companies appear to have espionage units whose mainfunction is to obtain copies of highly classified documents inorder to give their companies a competitive edge.''   The testimony also said the GTE case was ``but the tip of theproverbial iceberg. ... The investigation involves at least 25companies. ... Many of those companies are household words. ... Theprimary focus of the case is ... the indiscriminate distribution ofboth proprietary and highly classified government documents byindividuals within and without the government.''   Segal's planned testimony was released at the time, and prompteda harsh Justice Department response afterward.   ``The release by Senator Grassley's staff of erroneous,misleading and inflammatory information about a criminal case thatis currently pending trial is most unfortunate and regrettable. ...Justice must not be allowed to become a political football,'' thedepartment said.   Grassley said he had not announced Segal's appearance in advancebecause he believed there would be pressure on him from within thegovernment not to testify. He said Segal went to the Judiciarysubcommittee on administrative practices because he was frustratedwhen officials at the Justice and Defense departments refused topursue his findings.   ``I feel confident ... that ... Segal's testimony plays a keyrole in lessons learned from current FBI probe,'' Grassley said.``Prosecution only can be achieved when aggressive prosecutors ...capture the reins of control from the Justice Departmentbureaucracy.''</TEXT></DOC>
