To accomplishthis, we developed dispersion models at three levels of resolution. Thesespan the range from a three- dimensional dynamical model of the buoyantplume to a Gaussian plume model. A random-walk puff dispersion modelprovides the intermediate resolution. All three models include a concentrationfluctuation variance equation and provide the capability to representthe full probability distribution of expected concentration samples.A meteorological preprocessor which assumes horizontal homogeneity wasused for obtaining most of the modeled results. But also a new 4-dimensionalmeteorological data assimilator, developed as part of this project, wasutilized for some experiments. Model comparisons with EPRI's plume modelvalidation data sets show consistent simulations of the expected statisticalvariation in one-hour surface samples downwind of two different coal-firedpower plants. The higher resolution models did not show consistentlybetter performance than the lowest resolution model. One explanationis that uncertainty in the ambient meteorological environment apparentlyhad a large influence on model performance. Even so observations generallyfall within the simulated 95% confidence bounds for all the models. Thisrepresents a major improvement in the statistical simulation of dispersion.8 refs., 22 figs., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
