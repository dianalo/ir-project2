Describes hydrorefinement tests carried out in continuousapparatus at 400 C and 10 MPa electrolytic hydrogen pressure (99.0-99.5%vol purity) in the presence of coarsely porous alumonickelmolybdenumcatalyst and gives results obtained with the help of type UR-20 spectrophotometerand type RE-1301 radiospectrometer. Establishes that hydrogen-donor propertiesof fractions separated from hydrogenation products increase considerablyafter refinement and fractions with b.p. 190-425 C, 300-350 C, 350-400C and 300-400 C exceed the H-donor properties of petroleum paste formers.10 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
