The plan, submitted to Coast Guard Rear Admiral David E.Ciancaglini for approval, contradicts conclusions by stateofficials that more than three quarters of beaches surveyed werestill oiled from last year's spill.   The plan's call for bioremediation _ the use of the fertilizers_ also has been controversial. State environmental officials saidearlier in the week they won't approve its use until furtherstudies have been done to allay fears about possible toxicity.   Exxon plans to return its crews to the beaches May 1.   A multi-agency task force has been conducting a shoreline surveythis month and determined that conditions in Prince William Soundand the Gulf of Alaska have improved dramatically over the winter,Exxon said.   The oil company said its studies of 574 miles of shoreline sofar showed two-thirds without any oil at all, 22 percent with``very light oiling'' and 13 percent with ``a narrow to wide bandof weathered crude along sections.''   Those figures include subsurface oil as well, they said, whichwent below 4 inches on 16 miles of shoreline.   The state Department of Environmental Conservation reportedthose survey results differently Wednesday, saying 79 percent ofthe shoreline sites surveyed were still oiled.   ``I don't understand their numbers _ what the statistics arebased on,'' Exxon's technical manager, Bob Mastracchio, saidFriday. ``We've got 20 teams out there surveying shorelines.''   A more serious clash, however, may develop over bioremediation.   Of 209 sites Exxon has targeted so far for cleanup, it hopes touse bioremediation on 160 of them.   Some state and federal policymakers are worried about therelease of still more toxins. If they don't allow the fertilizers,``that's gonna be a dilemma for the agencies and the plan,''Mastracchio said.   ``If you can't use bioremediation, you can let nature remove theoil over the next few seasons. Bioremediation simply speeds up anatural degradation process.''   The company will meet with federal parks officials and stateenvironmental officials to continue talking about the use of thefertilizers, he said.   Exxon said it plans to manually pick up oily debris and tarballson the majority of sites targeted for cleanup, spotwash certainareas and till and rake sediment in others. Mastracchio said manualpickup was the least environmentally destructive kind of cleanup,comparing rock-washing an entire beach to ``strip-mining'' it.   The size of Exxon's crews this summer will be about 10 percentof last summer's. The company expects to have 1,100 people at workon the cleanup by June 1.   Exxon's plans call for eight mobile teams supported by eightberthing vessels and 12 landing craft. The teams would be supportedby 24 helicopters, 10 other aircraft, 20 work boats, eight supplyvessels and about 30 smaller boats and skiffs.   That compares with more than 10,000 workers and 1,000 boatsleased for last summer's $2 billion program.   Exxon officials wouldn't estimate how much this summer's cleanupwill cost, but they expect it will be their last.   ``We're putting out more than enough resources so the work canbe done by the end of this summer,'' said Carpenter.   Hundreds of miles of Alaska shoreline were fouled when thetanker Exxon Valdez slammed into a charted reef March 24, 1989,releasing nearly 11 million gallons of North Slope crude oil intothe water.   It was the nation's biggest oil spill, coating hundreds of milesof shoreline and killing hundreds of otters and thousands of birdsand other animals.   Ciancaglini, the federal on-site coordinator, said it will takehim several days to review Exxon's plan and the comments on itsubmitted by various state and federal agencies, and other parties.The review won't delay the start of cleanup, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
