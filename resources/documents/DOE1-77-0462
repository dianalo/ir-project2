Satisfactory development of such a methodology requiresthree analytical tools: a method to derive the true open-country windfrom observed data; a set of computer programs to calculate summary statisticsfor windspeed and direction; a method to analyse spatial (between-station)variability. Substantial progress has been made in the development ofthese tools. We discuss some preliminary results, particularly evidenceto suggest that when variations in site roughness are allowed for, certainsites may have more favourable wind regimes than raw observations suggest.</TEXT></DOC>
