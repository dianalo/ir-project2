This exemption does not applyto twenty-six source categories which are listed in the regulation. Thisprovision is identical to the requirements of 40 CFR 51.165(a)(4) (formerly40 CFR 51.18(j)(4)). Also, Alabama is adding to their regulation a sectionto allow public participation in the State's construction permit reviewprocess for nonattainment areas. This addition to the Alabama regulationmeets the requirements of 40 CFR 51.165 (formerly 40 CFR 51.18(h)) forthose permits, except that 40 CFR 51.161(2)(ii) requires a public commentperiod of at least thirty days.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>To be considered, comments must reach us by January 3, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>Copies of the documents relevant to this action areavailable for public inspection at the following locations:<ITAG tagnum="15">Environmental Protection Agency, Region IV, Air Programs Branch 345Courtland Street, NE., Atlanta, Georgia 30365. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Air Division  Alabama Department of Environmental Management, 1751Federal Drive Montgomery, Alabama 36109.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2> Beverly T.

This submittal contained certification that the revisions were precededby adequate notice and a public hearing. EPA proposes to approve theserevisions as submitted on the above dates. A discussion of the revisionsand the basis for EPA's proposal action now follows.Two revisions to Chapter 16 of Alabama's Air Pollution Control CommissionRules and Regulations were adopted by the Alabama Department of EnvironmentalManagement (ADEM) on November 13, 1985. The first is a change in 16.3.2(1).Specifically, subparagraph 16.3.2(1)(2) has been added to exempt certainnonattainment area sources from review under this new source review regulation.These sources are included in specific industry categories and would notbe considered major sources or major modifications unless fugitive emissionswere included in the total emissions calculations. The list of source categoriesand exemption provisions is identical to that in EPA's nonattainment areaexemption rule found at 40 CFR 51.165(a)(4), except that ``Fossil fuel-firedsteam electric plants of more than 250 million British thermal units perhour heat input'' is omitted. This was an oversight on the part of theState, and will be corrected by the State in the near future. In the meantimeno environmental effect is expected from the omission, since the only possibleeffect is to exclude fugitive emissions in determining if a steam electricplant is a major source, and the nature of steam electric plants causesthem to be major even excluding all fugitive emissions. As indicated above, the addition of subparagraph 16.3.2(1)(2) changes theAlabama NSR rule to match the federal NSR rule in fugitive emissions containedin 40 CFR 51.165. However, it represents a technical relaxation in theSIP as it could result in sources in certain categories becoming newlyexempt from NSR requirements in nonattainment areas including those lackingfully approved plans. Nevertheless, EPA believes this change is approvable,for the following reasons. In practical terms the only area likely to beaffected is the Jefferson County ozone nonattainment area. Jefferson Countyis also a designated particulate matter nonattainment area. All constructionbans that were in effect for particulate matter (TSP) nonattainment areaswere lifted with the promulgation of a new particulate standard (PM<T2>10</T2>) on July 1, 1987 (52 FR 24634). Portions of Jackson, Colbertand Lauderdale Countries are nonattainment for sulfur dioxide (SO<T2>2</T2>), but fugitive emissions are generally not significant in determiningNSR applicability for SO<T2>2</T2> sources. Etowah and Mobile Counties are designated ozone nonattainmentareas, but EPA has redesignated them to attainment. See 52 FR 17952 (May13, 1987). As to the Jefferson County ozone nonattainment area, the Countyadopted an attainment plan for ozone, which was submitted to EPA for reviewin November, 1986. However, before EPA completed its substantive review,it determined that the plan needed to be adopted by Alabama as well toensure state enforceability. This must be accomplished before EPA can completeits review and determine whether to propose approval of the plan. Alabamahas notified EPA that it expects state approval to occur in the near future.Thus, it appears that reasonable efforts are being made to adopt and submita complete plan for the remaining ozone nonattainment areas in Alabama.In addition, the State has indicated that it expects that few, if any,sources will actually be exempted from NSR by virtue of this change. Nomajor ozone sources subject to NSR have located in Alabama since this regulationwas adopted four years ago. In addition, Alabama has stated that this changewould not constrain the State's ability to obtain any additional emissionsreductions needed in its attainment efforts. Thus, EPA does not expectthis change to have a significant effect on air quality in Alabama. This revision originally addressed the Total Suspended Particulate (TSP)ambient air quality standards. However, EPA on July 1, 1987 (52 FR 24634),replaced the TSP ambient air quality standards with a new standard thatmeasures only those particles with an aerodynamic diameter equal to orless than 10 micrometers (PM10). At the State's option, EPA is continuingto process TSP SIP revisions which were in process at the time the newPM10 standard was promulgated. In the policy published on July 1, 1987(52 FR 24679, Column 2), EPA stated that it would regard existing TSP SIP'sas necessary interim particulate matter plans during the period precedingthe approval of State plans specifically aimed at PM10.Since 16.3.2 already requires review of all National Ambient Air QualityStandards, the State's regulation automatically requires that new and modifiedsources be reviewed for PM10. Alabama requested that Jefferson County beredesignated to unclassifiable for TSP in a letter dated February 2, 1988.This redesignation will be granted upon approval of Alabama's PM10 SIP.Significant level values will be included in a separate <T4>Federal Register </T4><T3>Notice </T3>which addresses the PM10 provisions.Alabama's SIP does not contain a definition of fugitive emissions, as requiredby 40 CFR 51.165(a)(1)(ix) (formerly 40 CFR 51.18(j)(ix)) whenever theexemption for fugitive emissions is used. This was an oversight, and Alabamais currently in the process of adopting the required definition. Finalapproval of 16.3.2(l)(2) will be made only after this definition is adoptedand submitted to EPA.The second revision was the addition of a new paragraph, 16.3.2(m), whichrequires public participation during State evaluation of applications forsources to construct or modify a facility in a nonattainment area. PreviouslyAlabama only required public participation in prevention of significantdeterioration (PSD) areas. This regulation includes procedures similarto the procedure which Alabama follows for PSD, and it allows the publicto comment on all applications. All comments and response are consideredbefore a final decision is made to accept or reject the permit applicationand to issue the permit.However, the regulation differs from the EPA requirements for public noticeat 40 CFR 51.161 in that it specifies Alabama will determine the lengthof each public comment period, rather than require a 30-day notice foreach permit. EPA proposes to approve the regulation in spite of this deficiencybecause the regulation represents a significant improvement over the presentregulation, which does not provide for any public notice. The Alabama SIPwill still be deficient because of this particular item, and also becausepublic notice is provided for only PSD and NSR permits rather than forall permits as required by 40 CFR 51.161(l).Further details pertaining to these regulation changes are contained inthe technical support document, which is available for public inspectionat EPA's Regional Office in Atlanta, Georgia.<ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Action</ITAG>After reviewing Alabama's New Source Review SIP revisions, EPA has foundthey substantially meet the requirements contained in 40 CFR Part 51.
