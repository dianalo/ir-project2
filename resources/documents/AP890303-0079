Coast Guard spokesman Keith Spangler said the 800-foot tankerExxon Houston sent a distress call at 8:20 p.m. Thursday off theHawaiian island of Oahu.   The captain of the tanker reported the ship was ``hard aground''three-tenths of a mile northwest of Barbers Point on Oahu'ssouthwest coast, about 15 miles west of the island's denselypopulated area containing Honolulu and Waikiki Beach, its mostpopular tourist area, Spangler said.   ``They've told us their fuel tanks were completedly emptied,''Spangler said.   He said an estimated 92,000 gallons of fuel oil had leakedthrough holes in the tanker's hull and 25,000 gallons of crude oilhad spilled.   Spangler said it wasn't clear whether the crude leaked when thetanker broke loose from its moorings in 12-to-14-foot seas, orwhether it spilled through holes in the hull. Officials don't knowif crude is continuing to leak, he added.   Spangler said the Oahu Civil Defense Agency reported early todaythat fuel oil was washing ashore on the beach at Barbers Point.However, he said the length of shoreline affected probably wouldn'tbe known until daybreak.   Winds and ocean currents should direct the spill east towardHonolulu, Spangler said. Earlier Coast Guard reports said rough seasappeared to be dissipating the oil.   Leonard Alcantara, a Honolulu attorney for Exxon, said the ship'scaptain, Kevin Dick, and the 23-member crew have remained aboard andwere in no danger.   ``They said they've suffered some damage, but they don't know howmuch yet,'' Spangler said.   The Exxon Houston was unloading Alaska North Slope oil at theHawaiian Independent Refinery at about 5:25 p.m. when a mooring linebroke, causing the offloading hoses to break, said Andrea Simpson, aspokeswoman for Pacific Resources Inc., the refinery's parentcompany.   The vessel reported trouble but did not request Coast Guardassistance when it broke its moorings, Spangler said.   A total of nine commercial and U.S. Navy tugboats were dispatchedto help dislodge the tanker, and environmental specialists also wereen route, officials said.</TEXT></DOC>
