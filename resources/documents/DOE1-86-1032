<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-86-1032 </DOCNO><TEXT>A two-stage automated system for mass spectrometric information processingis described. The system has the following features: the section of analysesis placed at a distance of 50 m fromthe main centralized processing means;the system is used for solving both research and technical problems;the system includes different-type mass spectrometers MI-1305,MI-1311,MI-1201, MV-3301 incompatible with computers. The lower level of thesystem is built on the basis of the RPT microcomputer. The BESM-6 computeris used as a computer of the collective use of the upper level. The systemoperates from 1986 and has permitted to increase the number of analysesperformed by 2-4 times with better economic indices as compared withthe earllier used system. The efficiency has increased due to the factthat it has become possible tocombine in time data accumulation fromseveral mass spectrometers and processing the results of measurementsat an upper-level computer. The average amount of repeated measurementsin one analysis is reduced because the scientist can repeat abortiveanalyses before the composition of the analyzed sample changes due tofast processing.</TEXT></DOC>
