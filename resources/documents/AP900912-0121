(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Eight environmental pioneers were namedWednesday to spend two years with just each other _ and 3,800varieties of plants and animals _ inside a glass-and-steel dometrying to duplicate Earth's ecosystem.   Among the crew are a 66-year-old gerontologist, an electricalengineer, a marine biologist and a botanist. They are two Britons,a Belgian, a German and four Americans.   All the ``biospherians'' have worked together for at least threeyears on the Biosphere II project, an attempt to copy the planet'snatural environment inside a 2\-acre closed, self-sustainingsystem. The planet's natural environment is designated Biosphere I.   ``I'm working five years toward this aim of a two-year closure,and the closer the day comes, the more excited I get,'' said crewleader Bernd Zabel, a 41-year-old German.   As a laboratory for showing ways to solve environmental problemssuch as pollution, the privately funded Biosphere could become amoneymaking venture, scientists have said. It also is a prototypefor sustaining life in space.   Inside the sealed geodesic frame, all air, water, food andwastes will be regenerated and recycled.   Only electricity will link its ecological system with theoutside. Computers and telephones will provide communications withmission control and the rest of the world.   Crew members will be able to leave via airlocks in event ofemergency.   Plans call for the venture to begin Dec. 5.   The other crew members, all single, are Abigail K. Alling, 31, amarine biologist and co-captain; Dr. Roy Walford, a nationallynoted gerontologist and nutritionist and professor of pathology atthe UCLA School of Medicine who will be medical officer; LindaLeigh, 38, scientific director; Sally Silverstone, 35; Taber K.MacCallum, 26; Jane Elizabeth Poynter, 28, and Mark Van Thillo, 29.   The $30 million world-within-the-world will be like a spacecolony tethered to Earth. It consists of distinct ecological areas,or biomes: desert, ocean, savannah, fresh and saltwater marshes,agriculture and human habitat.   ``I'm sure there'll be many emergencies that arise during thattwo-year period, but I think also that it ought to be an extremelystimulating and mind-expanding experience,'' said MargretAugustine, chief executive officer of Space Biospheres Ventures.   She said all the crew members are highly qualified, talented,dedicated, enthusiastic and ``extremely special people.'' By facingdifficult and dangerous situations in other ventures, she said,they have shown themselves capable of ``coming up with the neededdecisions and actions at the appropriate time.''   Augustine said six other people who were candidates for the crewalso hold key management positions with the project and will beinvolved in the experiment.   Asked about possible relationships developing among the peoplesealed inside the Biosphere, Leigh said that would be a personalmatter as long as it doesn't interfere with their work.   ``I anticipate there will be relationships developing as thereare in Biosphere I. I don't really see that will change,'' she said.   The wildlife areas interconnect, with only the agriculture andhuman habitat areas partitioned. The latter includes apartments,offices, labs and recreational space.   Plants will dispose of the humans' and animal's carbon dioxide,breaking it down into oxygen and carbon, and will provide food.Microbes will break down wastes; filters will purify air and water.   Moisture in the fairly humid confines will condense onrefrigerated coils over the tropical rain forest.   The biospherians will monitor and take advantage of theecological mix, which will range from rice to papayas, sorghum tosweet potatoes, plus wild plants, rotating from among 150 cropsseasonally.</TEXT></DOC>
