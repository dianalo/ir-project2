But late Saturday, Haiti deposed its military leader, Lt. Gen.Henri Namphy, and two military commanders took power, a governmentspokesman said in Port-au-Prince, the Haitian capital.   It was unclear whether the attacks on Sept. 11 and the followingday, blamed on the government, were related to Namphy's ouster.   The church council, which represents Roman Catholic andProtestant churches in 16 Caribbean countries, said the bloodyattacks were ``cold-blooded cruelty which was shocking even by thebrutal standards of Haitian repression.''   While army critic Rev. Jean Bertrand Aristide said Mass Sept. 11at St. Jean Bosco Church in Haiti, two dozen people armed with gunsand knives attacked killed parishioners before burning down thebuilding as soldiers watched from across the street.   Nine were killed in the massacre and 77 were wounded, of whichfour died at in the hospital, Radio Haiti Inter said Saturday.   Five men and a woman that night boasted on government televisionthey took part in the massacre, and the next day arsonists burneddown a second Roman Catholic church.   ``The inaction of the government security forces can only beinterpreted as collusion with the method of terrorizing the Haitianpopulation into silence,'' said the council's statement, releasedFriday.   Though the government of Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy said it``regretted'' the massacre and promised to punish the culprits,similar statements issued after mass killings in the past havenever resulted in investigations or convictions.   Namphy returned to power after ousting the 4-month-oldgovernment of civilian President Leslie Manigat in a coup June 19.Namphy previously ruled for two years after the exile to France ofPresident-for-Life Jean-Claude Duvalier on Feb. 7, 1986.   But on Saturday, Namphy was ousted in a military coup and takento the airport, said Frantz Lubin, Haiti's director of information.Lubin said he believed Commander Prosper Avril had been named thenew head of state and Dessalines Barracks Commander Jean-ClaudePaul as new commander-in-chief of the army.</TEXT></DOC>
