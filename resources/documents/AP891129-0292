But Sir James Goldsmith, the Anglo-French financier whoseHoylake Investment Ltd. is mounting the bid, dismissed the argumentas a desperate tactic in BAT management's ``no-holds-barredtakeover defense.''   The Illinois Department of Insurance hearings that beganWednesday are to determine the suitability of Hoylake to becomeFarmers' parent through the proposed acquisition of BAT, theLondon-based tobacco, retailing, paper and financial servicesconcern.   Goldsmith's $21.1 billion BAT takeover plan was suspendedearlier this year to allow Hoylake to seek approval from U.S. stateinsurance commissioners to change Farmers' ownership.   Hoylake has vowed to sell off all of BAT's non-tobacco holdingsunder the buyout plan. Farmers would be sold to French insurer AxaMidi Assurance for $4.5 billion.   Los Angeles-based Farmers operates in Illinois and eight otherstates. Illinois is the first to begin review of the takeover bidto determine if it is in the best interest of insurancepolicyholders.   Goldsmith has attempted unsuccessfully to block the reviews,arguing that state regulators have no constitutional right to passjudgment on a foreign buyout.   During Wednesday's hearing, attorneys for Hoylake argued thatthe question of the company's suitability to own or operate aninsurance carrier is irrelevant because if the BAT takeover issuccessful, Hoylake plans to simultaneously sell Farmers to AxaMidi.   ``Hoylake's consistent position is and has been that it has nowish to own and operate an insurance company in the United States _and Farmers in particular,'' Hoylake attorney Robert L. King saidin opening statements before Seymour Simon, the former statesupreme court justice serving as hearing officer.   Hoylake has entered into ``irrevocable contracts ensuring thatAxa Midi will own and control'' Farmers, King said.   ``Hoylake does not seek approval to own and operate Farmers,''he said, but rather authority to ``act purely as a conduit'' in thesale of the company to Axa Midi.   But Farmers attorney Doug Broadwater questioned whether animmediate sale was a certainty.   Hoylake had already offered state insurance regulators threepossible plans for the sale, only to change them later.   ``Every time Hoylake comes up with yet another possible scheme,this department is assured that nothing could go wrong,''Broadwater said, calling the takeover plan ``legally bizarre.''   He also said Hoylake's financial position is precarious and thatit lacks the qualifications to run an insurance business.   ``It is an offshore company engaged in no business other than toacquire BAT,'' Broadwater said.   Goldsmith said in a statement that Farmers' argument was anattempt to divert attention away from the merits of acquisition ofthe company by Axa Midi.   ``The suggestion that there is any danger of Midi not completingthe acquisition of Farmers is ludicrous,'' he said.   A hearing on the takeover plan before California regulators isscheduled for January. Those in Arizona, Idaho, Oregon andWashington are expected later next year, a Goldsmith spokesman said.   Hearings in Kansas, Ohio and Texas haven't been scheduled, hesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
