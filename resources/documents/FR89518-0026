Telephone (202) 732-1909.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2> On October 12, 1988, the Secretarypublished a notice of proposed rulemaking for the Indian Fellowship Programin the <T4>Federal Register </T4> (53 FR 39876). The explanatory statements inthe preamble to the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) are fully applicable.For the sake of brevity, those statements are not being reprinted here.Except for minor editorial and technical revisions, there is no differencebetween the NPRM and these final regulations. <ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Comments and Changes </ITAG><T3>Comments:</T3> Two comments were received concerning the proposal toaward fellowships primarily on the basis of scholastic merit. One commenterfelt that the award of fellowships based on scholastic merit would be adisadvantage to applicants from reservations, alleging that these studentsdo not perform well during the first two years of college. The commentersuggested that special consideration be given to this group of applicants.The second commenter expressed concern that the proposed emphasis on scholasticmerit would tend to exclude American Indian students who possess ``eminencecredentials'' (i.e., extensive experience and knowledge in their Indianculture, language, and history), stating that these students are less aptto achieve scholastically than Indian students who are more assimilatedin the dominant culture. This commenter suggested that experience and knowledgein Indian culture be given consideration equal to scholastic achievement.<T3>Discussion: </T3>Available data do not show that students from reservationshave lower grade point averages than Indian students from non-reservationschools. Standardized test scores, which are also considered in determiningscholastic merit, are evaluated in light of the average standardized testscores of American Indian students, including reservation-based students,rather than the general student population. The Secretary believes thispractice helps to reduce the effect of inequities resulting from institutionalor regional differences in the quality of education received. The Departmentwill review the FY 1989 applicants' grade point averages (GPAs) to determinewhether there is a significant difference in the GPAs of these groups andif such a difference has an effect on applicants' success in obtaininga fellowship. The intent of the proposal to base fellowship awards on scholastic meritis to ensure that the students who receive fellowships are the most likelyto complete their degree programs. In some cases, this may require studentsto improve their scholastic records, particularly with respect to the plannedfield of study, before applying for a fellowship. However, leadership andcommitment in the Indian community will also continue to be decisive factorsin the selection process. In addition, the Secretary believes it is important that limited Federalfunds aid those who are most in need. The Department of Education willexamine the income distribution of students receiving these fellowshipsto determine whether further regulation to limit participation on the basisof financial need versus merit is appropriate. <T3>Changes: </T3>None. <T3>Comments: </T3>A commenter suggested that certain changes be made insections pertaining to application requirements. The commenter suggestedthat andSection; 263.12(d)(2)(i) be revised to state that college as wellas high school references may submit letters of assessment and that andSection;263.12(d)(2)(ii) be revised to make it clear that professors and academicadvisors do not have to be connected to programs funded under Subpart 1of the Indian Education Act of 1988. Concerning andSection; 263.22, the commentersuggested that the application requirements for fellowships after the firstyear of funding be simplified by eliminating the requirement for assessmentletters and essays. <T3>Discussion: </T3>Professors and academic advisors who submit lettersof assessment do not have to be involved in Indian Education Act projects.The term ``instructor'' has the same meaning in these regulations thatit had in the previous regulations; it includes college instructors aswell as non-academic instructors. The Department will monitor the responseto this section and consider further revisions and clarification for futurerulemaking, if needed. Section 263.22 was not changed because letters ofassessments and essays are not required for continuation applications.<T3>Changes: </T3>A change was made to andSection; 263.12(d)(2)(ii) to specify``college professor'' and to rearrange the options under the category tomake it clear that the modifier concerning Subpart 1 programs refers onlyto coordinators. <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291 </ITAG>These regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order12291. They are not classified as major because they do not meet the criteriafor major regulations established in the order. <ITAG tagnum="84">Assessment of Educational Impact </ITAG>In the notice of proposed rulemaking, the Secretary requested commentson whether the proposed regulations would require transmittal of informationthat is being gathered by or is available from any other agency or authorityof the United States. Based on the responses to the proposed rules and on its own review, theDepartment has determined that the regulations in this document do notrequire transmission of information that is being gathered by or is availablefrom any other agency or authority of the United States. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 34 CFR Part 263 </ITAG>Colleges and universities, Education, Engineers, Health professions, Indians_Education,Law, Natural resources, Scholarships and fellowships.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: April 11, 1989.   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Lauro F.
