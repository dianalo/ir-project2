In the wake of a general slump in crude oil prices on European spot markets for the second day in a row, U.S. futures prices plunged yesterday by 55 cents a barrel, with West Texas Intermediate for October delivery closing at $14.24.    In addition, major U.S. refiners launched another round of 50-cent-a-barrel cuts in West Texas Intermediate field postings -- the price paid by refiners for oil bought in the field. The latest reduction, the second of that size within a week, dropped the posted price for the U.S. benchmark crude to $14 a barrel.    Downward pressure on oil prices is generally expected to continue unless OPEC reduces output, now at 20 million barrels a day -- a rate considered far too high for current consumption patterns. Nevertheless, some traders and analysts suggest that prices may be nearing bottom.    &quot;Although we are making new lows -- numbers we haven't seen since last year -- we may see buying around $14,&quot; said Eric Bolling of Edge Trading Corp.    George Friesen, vice president-research at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said prices possibly could fall as much as $2 a barrel more &quot;unless OPEC does something to restrain production.&quot; Michael Rothman, senior petroleum market analyst at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, believes the &quot;downside&quot; at this point is only $1 a barrel. &quot;We're not seeing the type of {production} discipline erosion in OPEC like that in 1985 and 1986,&quot; he said.    Also, other analysts said, the high OPEC output might correct itself soon because of brimming storage tanks as inventories mount world-wide. And Robert Boslego, a Winchester, Mass., consultant, said his firm, which monitors petroleum inventories and the chartering of oil tankers, already has detected evidence of a downturn in the leasing of vessels for Persian Gulf loadings.    &quot;This downturn indicates oil exports from the Middle East will peak soon,&quot; he said.    Mr. Boslego also questions whether petroleum inventories are really as burdensome as many believe. At least in the U.S., he said, &quot;we have basically seen the elimination of the crude stock {inventory} surplus.&quot; And he has gone back to 1982 in comparing days of supply (inventories divided by daily demand) for this time of the year for crude, gasoline and fuel oil. All, he said, are at the lowest levels for this time of the year since 1982.    The figures used by Mr. Boslego are based on American Petroleum Institute statistics for the week ended Aug. 26. The latest API weekly report on petroleum inventories, imports and refinery operations, due out late yesterday, was delayed one day because of the Labor Day holiday.    In other commodity markets yesterday:   GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Wheat, corn and soybean futures prices continued to rise on the wave of brisk export activity that has enlivened the industry since last week. In particular, the price of wheat for December delivery climbed just short of the contract high. Last week, trading rallied around reports of big corn sales to the Soviets. After the close of trading yesterday, the Agriculture Department confirmed the sale of 550,000 metric tons of corn to the Soviet Union. Traders are also expecting a wheat sale of 300,000 metric tons to China, said Arthur Parrish, a grain analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., New York. Traders expect dry weather in the wheat-producing regions of China, Canada and Argentina to continue to cut expected crop harvests and to bring business to the U.S., analysts said.    COFFEE: Futures prices rose mostly on technical considerations. The December contract ended at $1.2721 a pound, up 4.04 cents. While concern continued to be expressed about the persistent dry weather in coffee-growing regions of Brazil, the world's leading producer, one dealer said drought still wasn't an imminent danger. &quot;If we return from the International Coffee Organization meetings in London at the end of September and it still hasn't rained, then it would be a consideration,&quot; he said. He noted that in dry spells of past years, rains as late as the middle of October had resulted in normal crops. Of greater concern at the moment, he said, is that a tightness of higher-quality mild coffees continues, and producing nations don't seem amenable to special increases in export quotas for these types of coffee to satisfy demand in consuming countries.    PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices ended mixed. Gold dropped to its lowest level of the year, as deflationary economic developments dominated sentiment, according to analysts. December-delivery gold ended at $434.80 an ounce, down $2.60. Although the December contract has traded below that level this year, yesterday's was the lowest settling price and was only $4 above the life-of-contract low of $430.80, set Feb. 18, 1987. December silver declined 3.50 cents an ounce to $6.6250, while October platinum was up 60 cents an ounce to $524.10. Analysts cited weakness in crude oil and a rise in unemployment as the latest factors diminishing fears about inflation. Another analyst said continued lack of demand for bullion for all the metals was an added depressing factor. Silver wasn't affected by a report that Peruvian miners will go on strike again, this time for three days beginning Monday, to protest dismissals at one mine. One analyst observed that because the recently ended month-long strike didn't greatly influence the silver market, the scheduled three-day stoppage isn't expected to either.    COCOA: Futures prices fell to life-of-contract lows for the fourth consecutive session, as an apparent overabundance of supplies continued. The December contract fell to $1,227 a metric ton, for a loss of $20. One analyst said that cocoa from the current Brazilian harvest was arriving at ports at a rate almost three times as great as last year, which would indicate more than ample supplies. Consuming nations at the International Cocoa Organization meetings in London are said to be sympathetic to a proposal to eliminate a $30-a-ton levy on cocoa exports from producing countries. That money goes to the ICCO, whose future is said to be imperiled by financial problems. Concern over the ICCO's situation is also a price-depressing element, because the organization tries to support prices through its purchases of cocoa for its buffer stock, which now amounts to about 250,000 tons. Should the ICCO collapse, that cocoa could come onto the market, an analyst said. </TEXT></DOC>
