First, came huge charges that wiped out profit for two years. Then came a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation of the company's disclosure of certain financial information. Later, it was the delay of a much-heralded computer line.    This week, holders got a pleasant surprise. In perhaps the most adroit move of his embattled 2 1/2-year reign, Gould Chairman and Chief Executive Officer James F. McDonald announced the sale of the company to the Japanese industrial giant, Nippon Mining Co., at a premium price of $23.25 a share.    For Mr. McDonald, the $1.1 billion purchase is a rescue from the possibility of a hostile takeover and, perhaps, the loss of his job. He will continue to operate the troubled maker of computers and electrical products, based in Rolling Meadows, Ill., under the umbrella of the Tokyo metal, petroleum refining and petrochemical giant.    For Nippon Mining, the price for a company that looks on Wall Street like an unwanted loser may be even higher than meets the eye. In addition to the premium price, Gould's troubled defense and computer businesses could be dead weights. And its acquisition plan could raise broad regulatory questions in Washington, where federal agencies may decide the transaction warrants a national-security review. In addition to its defense business, Gould's mini-supercomputers and electronics parts are used in the defense industry.    Nevertheless, Nippon Mining seems likely to find nuggets buried in the rubble of Gould's failed eight-year strategy to find several niche markets in high-technology industries. Most important, Nippon Mining will gain a foothold in the obscure but highly profitable business of copper foil, which is used in a variety of electronic circuit boards. That prospect, coupled with the weak dollar and a keen Japanese appetite for a foothold in the U.S. high-technology market, make the Gould acquisition appealing.    &quot;Some of these moves may not be totally rational by Western standards,&quot; says Kevin Jones, a principal at McKinsey andamp; Co.'s Tokyo office. But Japanese companies are prepared to do whatever is necessary to expand into the international market, he said.    The biggest payoff is likely to be in electronics parts because of Gould's role as one of two commanding players in copper foil, an ultra-thin copper film used in circuit boards for electronic products ranging from personal computers to complex missile systems.    Gould and Square D Co., based in Palatine, Ill., together command about 80% of the world market for the foil, according to Barry F. Willman, a research analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein andamp; Co. He estimates that the copper foil business will generate 30% of Gould's revenue this year, but will account for about 75% of the company's profit.    &quot;It's an obscenely profitable business,&quot; said H.P. Smith, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. &quot;And Nippon Mining would have lost their shirt trying to start the business up from scratch.&quot;    No wonder Nippon Mining President Yukio Kasahara talks glowingly of Gould's &quot;quality,&quot; its &quot;very solid core business,&quot; and its &quot;very high&quot; prospects. From Japan's perspective, Gould's technology assets outshine its disappointing track record because of the weak dollar. And for an old-line company like Nippon Mining with business woes of its own, the purchase offers a quick way to internationalize.    Mr. McDonald initiated the Gould buy-out by opening talks with Nippon Mining, Gould's longtime venture partner, about ways to protect Gould from a takeover. Many observers expected Gould to become a takeover target once it sold its troubled NavCom Systems defense division -- a unit Mr. McDonald found Nippon Mining was willing to swallow temporarily.    Nevertheless, the Gould buy-out may mark a new round of Japanese shopping for U.S. companies. &quot;Rather than build something completely new, it's cheaper to just buy a U.S. company,&quot; says Hajime Karatsu, a professor at Tokai University and an adviser to Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. Japan's smokestack companies are trying to diversify quickly and inexpensively into technology, Mr. Karatsu says. &quot;We will probably see a growing number of examples of this,&quot; he says.    But the transaction could pose broader regulatory problems for Nippon Mining than initially expected. Gould has said federal officials approved the sale, providing Gould puts NavCom Systems into a trust run by current management.    However, even if Gould divests itself of NavCom Systems, the Pentagon or the Commerce Department may judge its mini-supercomputers and electronics parts businesses too strategically important to be transferred to foreign ownership. The businesses produce products that have both civilian and military applications, and there are still no clear-cut standards for determining whether a U.S. company turning out such sensitive &quot;dual-use&quot; products can be sold to a foreign buyer. Mr. McDonald said he didn't expect any regulatory problems.    Fujitsu Ltd.'s earlier attempt to acquire most of the shares of Fairchild Semiconductor Corp. left no handy references; the Japanese concern withdrew the offer before a federal review panel could hand down a decision. And the Reagan administration has yet to issue regulations for enforcing a provision of the newly signed trade act relating to such reviews.    An administration official familiar with the provision anticipated that the judgments will be made on a &quot;case-by-case basis.&quot; Senate aides who helped draft the legislation said the President's power to block such takeovers is still &quot;discretionary.&quot;    If the sale does go through, Nippon Mining will still be saddled with a grab bag of problems. Gould's computer division has been hurt by soft demand for mini-supercomputers, scaled-down versions of supercomputers that are used for complex calculations by engineers and researchers. A flotilla of competitors has aggressively cut prices to gain market share.    Analysts also wonder how well the division will fit Nippon Mining's business mix. &quot;Copper foil is a little high-tech,&quot; said Smith Barney's Mr. Smith. &quot;But Nippon may sell the computer business because it's a little too high-tech.&quot; Mr. McDonald said that if Nippon Mining decides the business isn't a good fit, he may consider participating in a buy-out of the unit.    ---               The Changing Face of Gould Inc.
