FisherandM;Businessland Inc. has shaken the faith of investors and customers byreporting a loss of $23 million for its fiscal year, most of it coming in itsfinal quarter.andM;The national computer reseller last week reported a net loss of $21.5 millionfor its fourth fiscal quarter, which ended on June 30.andP;  The San Jose, Calif.,andO;company went into the red despite revenues of $339 million for the quarter, a5 percent jump in sales over the same time last year.andM;To make the matters worse, Businessland restated its second- andthird-quarter results, citing &quot;accounting errors.&quot; Those mistakes, whichdoubled the company's third-quarter losses, have caused some analysts toquestion the competence of Businessland's management.andM;&quot;When we read about their financial problems we took a step back,&quot; saidDarryl Stewart, senior systems consultant for a large publishing company.andM;Stewart said his firm, which he asked not be identified, was negotiating withBusinessland and other resellers for a major systems-integration project.andO;Now, Stewart said his firm is hesitating to deal with Businessland, wonderinghow long the company will stay in business.andM;Businessland's dismal earnings report sent the company's stock plummeting 58percent to $2.88 on Aug.andP;  6.andP;  With its weakened market value, some analystssay Businessland, which reported about $1.4 billion in sales for the year,may make an attractive takeover target.andM;David Norman, Businessland's CEO, blamed the poor quarter on lower operatingmargins aggravated by deferred credits from some vendors and a largeinventory of spare parts for computers serviced by the company.andP;  The lossesincluded a $6 million charge connected to the closing of 15 facilities.andM;Norman attributed $4 million in losses to Businessland's internationaloperations and $2 million in losses to the company's ailing ComputerCraftsubsidiary.andP;  Meanwhile, Businessland's push into the high end of the PCmarket has not yet paid off, he said.andP;  &quot;We got ahead of ourselves,&quot; saidNorman.andP;  &quot;Hopefully, we will see the customers and the margins to warrant ourinvestment.&quot;andM;Norman said Businessland will consolidate some of its operations to trimexpenses, but he pledged to cut the number of employees through attrition,not layoffs.andP;  &quot;Fiscal '90 was a bad year, but I'm confident that fiscal '91will be a good year,&quot; he said.andM;Critics say the company has yet to show it can make money by selling servicein addition to hardware.andP;  They say Businessland got fat from the days itreceived favorable treatment from vendors and discounted products heavily tomake volume sales.andP;  The company is still reeling from a rift with CompaqComputer Corp. that cost it Compaq's authorization for nearly a year.andM;Although critics say Businessland will have trouble turning itself around,many analysts believe the company will make it in the long run.andM;&quot;They're too big a company to go away, and they're too important to too manycustomers,&quot; said Lise Buyer, a vice president of Needham andamp; Co.andP;  Inc., a NewYork investment firm.andP;  &quot;I suspect they will recover.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
