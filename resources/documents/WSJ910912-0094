In an Aug.13 letter to the editor, &quot;Our Standard of Living Isn't ReallyDeclining,&quot; Pierre A. Rinfret attempted to discredit a studyby the Council on Competitiveness and prove that Americans'standard of living has actually improved in relation to thatof EEC countries. Mr. Rinfret compared 1980 and 1990 figuresfor the difference between the U.S. standard of living andthat of the European Economic Community ($5,548 in 1980 vs.$6,201 in 1990) and concluded that Americans in 1990 aredecidedly better off than their EEC counterparts.   Unfortunately, Mr. Rinfret overlooked a simple explanationfor this difference in per-capita gross domestic productfigures. Greece was not granted full admission to the EECuntil 1981. Spain and Portugal were admitted in 1986. Isuspect Mr. Rinfret's figures for per-capita GDP differencesdo not take into account this addition of more than 55million of Europe's poorest people. The EEC in 1990 was muchmore inclusive than it was in 1980. To make a meaningfulcomparison using the EEC's 1980 and 1990 per-capita GDPfigures one would have to subtract the population and GDP ofGreece, Spain and Portugal from the 1990 EEC calculation.</LP><TEXT>   Thus, while I share Mr. Rinfret's skepticism of theprecision of figures used by the Council on Competitiveness,his comparison is meaningless and his conclusion isunfounded.
