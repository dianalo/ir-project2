The basic controversy has been rekindled by PresidentReagan's proposal of a . . .deployment of the MX. Three aspects of thestatements cited bear mention. The first, obviously, is the disparitybetween the two survivability estimates. The second is that the lowerestimate came from a gentleman who has not generally been regarded asan alarmist about the Soviet threat, while the upper estimate was renderedby someone who has a reputation for regarding that threat very seriously,indeed. The third is that, after the publication of these statements,no data (as differentiated from rhetoric) were forthcoming in the publicpress to prove that either was wrong. The purpose of this article isto suggest that, in a certain sense, both gentleman were &quot;right&quot; andthen to pursue the implications of this suggestion for U.S. strategicdoctrine and strategic force planning.</TEXT></DOC>
