Thepresent annual output is about 2.2 million tonnes saleable (R.O.M. 4.5million). All the mining area is under the sea bed of the Pacific Ocean.The dip of coal seam is approximately 1/10, a number of faults existand the panel is limited to extend sufficiently. It has wrestled withthe mechanization of longwalls and with the improvement of mining techniquesthroughout its history. In 1963 a mechanized longwall system with a combinationof elementary Self-Advancing Support and coal plough was adopted andthen, in following years, similar systems were applied to thick seams.These elementary mechanized longwalls could not accomplish high productivitydue to insufficient power of plowing, unstable advance of steering thesupport and defenceless configuration of shielding goaf flush. It wasconcluded that a longwall mining system using a combination of ShieldSupport and Drum Shearer is the best method to obtain a high productivity.In 1967 the test operation was commenced with a short wall face. Theso-called SD System has already lasted 20 years. Many difficulties havebeen encountered and conquered and the system has been the major miningmeans for a long time. This report describes how SD System was born,how it grew and how it has come to maturity. 11 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
