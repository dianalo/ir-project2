The Democratic Platform Committee wrapped up work in a marathonsession Saturday night on a party blueprint for what it calls ``TheRestoration of Competence and Hope.''   Michael Dukakis's delegates easily turned aside Jackson effortsto add planks that would have committed the Democrats to raisetaxes on the wealthy, freeze the Pentagon budget, double educationspending, commit the United States to no-first-use of nuclearweapons, and call for Palestinian self-determination.   Eleanor Holmes Norton, Jackson's platform chief, said Sunday nodecisions had been made on which if any of the issues Jackson willfight for on the floor of next month's convention in Atlanta.   She said Jackson himself must make that decision, taking intoaccount not only gains he made on both the party's platform andrules for 1992, but ``how he sees his own future politically.''   As it stands, the broad-brush, moderate platform makes nodollars-and-cents promises, but vows the Democrats will ``restorecompetence, caring and incorruptibility'' to Washington and``reverse seven years of `voodoo economics,' `trickle down'policies and fiscal irresponsibility.''   ``There's nothing in the document with which he disagrees,''said Dukakis issues director Christopher Edley, who observed thaton issues such as acid rain, health care and defense the platformis less specific than the Massachusetts governor has been.   But if the entire platform was tailored to suit Dukakis, manypassages also bore Jackson's stamp, from its call for an indexedminimum wage to its declaration that South Africa is a terroriststate to a slap at corporate raiders and to a commitment tosame-day and mail-in voter registration.   ``Although we have differences ... about 95 percent of all theissues that came up between these two campaigns have been resolvedin a peaceful and in a unified way, and I know that scares theRepublicans to death,'' former Gary, Ind., Mayor Richard Hatchersaid late Saturday shortly before the panel finished its work.   It was Hatcher who offered the first minority amendmentSaturday: a shotgun Jackson budget plan that would have raised thetax rate on 600,000 upper-income Americans from 28 to 50 percentand frozen the Pentagon budget for five years. It went down,108-44, in the only stand-up vote the committee took.   The committee handled without rancor nearly a score of otheramendments by voice votes, rejecting some key Jackson stands butaccepting others, including ones calling for Third World debtrelief and significant increases in child care aid for low- andmiddle-income families.   Paul G. Kirk Jr., the party chairman, exulted that the PlatformCommittee had followed his instructions to avoid ``a litany ofsocial, cultural or ideological buzzwords.''   ``Common sense politics has given us a short statement ofprinciple all Democrats can run on in November,'' Kirk said in astatement from Washington.   Mike Barnes, the former Maryland congressman who led Dukakis'splatform team, told reporters that in working on the past fourparty platforms, ``I have never seen a situation that was anywherenear this united.''   He said it showed ``the Democratic party really has matured andis ready to take the reins of government.''   ``There may be in Atlanta some further discussion of theseissues,'' Barnes predicted. ``That's normal. But I'm confident thatif there is, it will be done in the same spirit we saw here inDenver.''   Norton, a Georgetown University law professor and formerchairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, saidJackson lost on the centerpiece of his campaign, the budget planfor tax hikes and a military freeze, but won on the second mostimportant issue: South Africa.   She said some of the issues it lost on were ``important but notcentral'' to Jackson's campaign, but she declined to be specific.   In weighing floor fights, she said, ``We ought to look at theeffect it will have on the convention itself. Will it be divisivefor no important reason? Is it worth the trade-off in divisiveness?... (Does) the issue need the open and visible support of aconvention or ... would it only be icing?   ``There have indeed been significant differences between JesseJackson and Michael Dukakis during this campaign,'' she said.``Those did not evaporate at Mackinac and Denver. What did happen,however, is that the governor and the reverend in these proceedingsmoved closer together.''   The committee staff was still working Sunday to finalize thelanguage of the amended platform, which will not be final untilapproved by the convention in Atlanta on July 19.   But it was expected to run around 4,000 words _ a tenth the sizeof the 1980 and 1984 platforms and the shortest since the terseplatforms that Franklin D. Roosevelt ran on in 1932 and 1936.</TEXT></DOC>
