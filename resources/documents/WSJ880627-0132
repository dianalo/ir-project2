Industry experts cite a slowing in the growth of world petroleum demand, production behavior in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and a buildup of oil inventories.    Many others share the view of William L. Randol, senior petroleum analyst at First Boston Corp., that the inventory rebuilding that normally takes place in the third quarter has already occurred -- as suggested by huge U.S. crude oil stocks totaling 364.2 million barrels, or 12% above a year ago.    &quot;With nothing on the horizon to cause an increase in consumption and with the likelihood that the cheating in OPEC vis-avis production quotas will continue, it is very likely that oil prices will weaken over the summer months,&quot; Mr. Randol says. The soonest he foresees any recovery &quot;is late in the fourth quarter when petroleum demand will rise seasonally.&quot;    Some others expect the crude-price slump to bottom out sooner. &quot;The worst should be over by the middle of August,&quot; says Peter Gignoux, manager of the London energy department for Shearson Lehman Hutton. But before then, perhaps by mid-July, Mr. Gignoux looks for the futures price of West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude, to fall to $15.50 a barrel. In futures trading Friday, WTI closed at $16.01 a barrel, down 36 cents.    Robert Boslego, president of a Winchester, Mass., energy-consulting firm, has analyzed current contract values on the U.S. futures market to assess the market view of the price outlook for the second half. &quot;Based on what the market is saying, we calculate that prices would average 9.1% lower than the $18.84 average of the second half of 1987,&quot; he says. But he believes that excessive crude inventories will cause oil prices to fall even further.    In U.S. oil fields, where refiners set the prices for crudes, WTI postings are down to $15.75 a barrel -- $4 under last summer's peak, when prices surged because of panic buying tied to Persian Gulf tensions. OPEC crudes generally average $1 to $1.50 a barrel below WTI prices. Some OPEC crudes are currently $4 a barrel under the now-meaningless $18 official price. A few traders expect them to go as low as $12 a barrel before a turnaround.    Crude oil's abundance doesn't hold true for some petroleum products, though. In the U.S., where a record 29,510 gasoline contracts were traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange Friday, there is talk of tight supplies of motor fuel because of high demand, refinery problems and the bottleneck on the Mississippi River.    And not everyone is predicting that crude-oil prices will slide in the second half. Paul Mlotok, the Salomon Brothers Inc. oil economist, expects that on average they will be higher than in the first half.    But even though Mr. Mlotok is still more bullish than most on crude oil's prospects, last week he reduced by $1.50 to $3 a barrel his earlier projections for third- and fourth-quarter prices. He now expects WTI for the third quarter to average $17.80 a barrel, down from his previous projection of $20.80. For the fourth quarter, he forecasts $19, down from $20.50, and for the full year, $17.75 a barrel, down from $19.    Despite the revisions, Mr. Mlotok looks for an average of $18.40 a barrel for the second half, up $1.30 a barrel from his estimates for first-half prices. &quot;I still see demand going up because of the very strong fundamentals in the second half,&quot; he says, &quot;but what's changed is my perception of OPEC behavior.&quot;    Production discipline in OPEC was &quot;fairly impressive&quot; from August 1986, following the oil-price crash, through the first quarter of 1988, Mr. Mlotok says. But during the 1988 second quarter, he adds, OPEC's discipline broke down as it overproduced into a weak market. &quot;Strong fundamentals can save OPEC from experiencing a price collapse,&quot; he says, &quot;but the overproduction will forestall the strong price recovery that could have occurred.&quot;    The consensus is that OPEC, with output around 18.5 million barrels a day, pumped too much oil in the second quarter. &quot;There was a surplus of 500,000 barrels a day,&quot; says a delegate to OPEC.    But views vary widely on demand for OPEC oil for the remainder of the year. Mr. Mlotok projects a need for 18.5 million barrels a day in the third quarter, rising to 19 million in the fourth. Sun Corp.'s estimates are 18 million and 18.5 million.    OPEC itself is divided. Estimates from economists in the 13 member nations differ by as much as one million barrels a day -- with some, a minority, projecting that demand for OPEC oil could range as high as 19 million barrels a day in the fourth quarter.    Grains and Soybeans   Scattered showers in the upper Midwest and scattered selling by futures traders anxious to lock in profits late last week slowed the runaway rally in grain and soybean futures.    But this week it's &quot;back into the oven&quot; for Midwestern growing regions as temperatures in the upper 90s to low 100s are sweeping back into the area and rain clouds are drifting away, said Victor Lespinasse, a futures analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.    He said that while corn and soybean futures prices may be &quot;temporarily consolidating around current levels,&quot; the trend in both markets calls for higher prices ahead. He noted that the bullish trend was apparent during Friday's trading in both markets. Sellers tried to knock prices sharply lower, he said, only to have trading in most contract months bounce back to close unchanged to only slightly lower.    &quot;The sellers are only making a one-night stand in these markets; the buyers are the ones making a real commitment to their positions,&quot; added Dan Markey, a futures analyst with Agri Analysis in Chicago.    Orange Juice   American and European buyers of Brazilian frozen concentrated orange juice, who normally begin to get new-crop supplies around midsummer, may have to wait longer this year. As a result, prices, which tend to ease as the crop comes to market, are likely to retain the gains they've built up in recent months.    Prices of Brazilian concentrate, which last October were $1,300 to $1,400 a metric ton, rose to a record $2,000 in January and since then have held around that level. A major factor has been strong demand for the juice from Europe because of the drop in the U.S. dollar; the juice is denominated in dollars.    Futures prices rose from around $1.35 a pound in October to $1.8050 in January. On Friday, the July contract jumped four cents to $1.8125.    Orange production in Brazil during the 1988-89 season that will begin Friday is forecast at 230 million boxes of 90 pounds each, up about 10 million boxes from 1987-88, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The crop would have been significantly bigger if it weren't for unusually hot, dry weather during July-September 1987 that delayed the crop and is now causing a four-week to six-week delay in the marketing season.    Exportable supplies of juice in Brazil have been tight during the past year, the department says, and almost all supplies from the 1987-88 crop have been used up. Despite an increase in the amount of fruit used for juice in Brazil, production of the concentrate during 1988-89 will be little changed from this season because a decline in yields will offset the larger output, according to the department. Juice sales to the U.S. will be down sharply in response to the continued improvement of Florida's crop and sluggish juice sales, the department said.    &quot;Despite the fact U.S. production will be better able to cover domestic demand, Brazilian imports will still be needed to meet projected use, so Brazilian developments are having an impact on prices,&quot; said Sandra Kaul, analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., New York. </TEXT></DOC>
