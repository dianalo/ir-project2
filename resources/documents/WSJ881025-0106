Wall Street Raid </HL><SO> </SO><IN> STK SCR </IN><G> CNG </G><TEXT>   Not even the insiders know how many Senators were actually there early Saturday morning to give voice approval to the inside-trading bill. In the dark of night, someone decided to wrap a neat gift for American lawyers and British stockbrokers.    Rep. John Dingell, who devised this bill along with Rep. Edward Markey, made the mistake earlier this year of asking for a General Accounting Office study of insider trading. The GAO said that how courts will rule is not clear, and that &quot;it may become necessary for Congress to amend the securities laws to show more clearly what behavior constitutes insider trading.&quot; But the new bill leaves the term undefined.    The bill does make clear that anyone who commits the undefined crime will pay dearly. Plaintiffs will no longer have to prove that alleged inside trading actually caused them to lose money. Currently, plaintiffs must show some relationship between illegal trading and their own decision to buy or sell stocks. The bill says anyone can collect if he traded stocks &quot;contemporaneously,&quot; whatever that means, with inside trading.    He can also sue the employers of the inside trader. There will be innumerable cases to establish what exactly is meant by firms that &quot;knowingly or recklessly failed to establish, maintain, or enforce any policy or procedure required&quot; to prevent inside trading. Firms could be assessed triple damages in civil cases and up to $2.5 million in criminal cases.    There's even a section titled &quot;Authority to Award Bounties to Informants.&quot; The SEC can give up to 10% of the fines to whoever provides information leading to a penalty. Look for Ralph Nader to set up a securities &quot;public interest&quot; subsidiary to take on these lucrative cases.    For that matter, an unclear law with big penalties should keep Wall Street plaintiff and defense lawyers in silk stockings for decades to come. It has always seemed to us that &quot;inside traders&quot; who break confidentiality agreements or pay for secrets with suitcases of cash could easily be prosecuted on other laws -- for example, the easy-to-define crime of stealing. And our concern has been that securities trading, a minute-by-minute business, will not work efficiently if everyone has to consult a lawyer on every step, if the main worry is not the worth of the stock but the likelihood of a lawsuit. We particularly worry about the re-emergence of cases suggesting that merely possessing unequal information or insights, the above-board pursuit of legions of Wall Street analysts, establishes &quot;inside information.&quot;    There may have been a time when Congress could create all the uncertainties it wanted and the markets would just have to live to cope. That time has now passed. When uncertainty and inefficiency inflate the price of doing business in one market, the business will look to go elsewhere. When the bill comes to the President for a signature or veto, he might think a bit about American competitiveness and the like, and remember that the less regulated London and Tokyo stock markets are now but a quick phone call away. </TEXT></DOC>
