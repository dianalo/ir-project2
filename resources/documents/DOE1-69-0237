<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-69-0237 </DOCNO><TEXT>Several methods were investigated to prepare CuInS(e){sub 2}, using electroplatingtechniques near room temperature, to explore them for obtaining photovoltaicallyactive films. No significant photoactivity resulted, unless an annealingstep (at greater than or equal to 400{degree}C) was added to the process.Promising PV activity was found only if this anneal was carried out ina S(e)-containing atmosphere. Therefore, in part of this project, thetwo steps, metal deposition and chalcogen incorporation, were separated.These experiments showed that chalcogenization is the most critical stepin obtaining films that are PV active. The composition of the films obtainedafter the chalcogenization step can be varied considerably by a chemical,postannealing treatment. PV activity of films was checked in a simple,rapid way by sputtering Cd onto them. Both these junctions, as well asthose obtained by ITO deposition, show improved rectification and PVactivity, after air anneal of the chalcogenized film, before junctionformation. Possible causes for this are discussed. Separate C-V experimentson Al/CuInSe{sub 2}/Mo structures, using CuInSe{sub 2}/Mo films, provideddirect evidence of the persistence of two types of CuInSe{sub 2} layers,distinguishable by their doping concentration.</TEXT></DOC>
