Management measures for 1989were effective on May 1, 1989 (54 FR 19798, May 8, 1989). The followingadjustments to the management measures are authorized by the ocean salmonregulations at 50 CFR 661.21(b)(1)(i)-(v).<ITAG tagnum="85">Adjustment to Commercial Fishery From the Red Buoy Line to Cape Falcon,Oregon</ITAG>The 1989 commercial fishery from the Red Buoy Line to Cape Falcon, Oregon,opened for one day on August 21, 1989, then closed as regularly scheduledfor two days on August 22-23. Based on the best available information,the Regional Director determined that when the fishery reopened on August24, commercial fishermen should be given additional opportunity to maximizethe harvest of the chinook salmon quota. Therefore, the northern boundaryof this fishery, the Red Buoy Line, was moved northward to Leadbetter Point,Washington. In accordance with this modification, Conservation Zone 1 atthe Columbia River mouth was closed (defined in the preseason notice at54 FR 19805, note C-3). Furthermore, the northern boundary for the landingrequirement that ``all salmon must be delivered in the area from LeadbetterPoint to Cape Falcon'' as announced in the preseason notice at 54 FR 19802also was moved northward so that deliveries could be made at Westport,Washington. All modifications were effective 0001 hours local time, August24, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="85">Adjustment to Commercial Fishery From Leadbetter Point, Washington,to Cape Falcon, Oregon</ITAG>Upon further evaluation of chinook salmon landings in the expanded commercialfishery from Leadbetter Point, Washington, to Cape Falcon, Oregon (revisedabove), the Regional Director determined that the landing ratio restriction(ratio of coho to chinook salmon which can be landed) should be liberalizedfor chinook salmon.The preseason notice at 54 FR 19802 announced that ``A single daily landinglimit per vessel of 40 coho and 4 chinook is permitted.'' The best availableinformation indicates that increasing the chinook portion of the ratioto 8 fish would provide fishermen additional opportunity to maximize theharvest of the allowable chinook quota. Therefore, effective 0001 hourslocal time, August 29, 1989, the landing restrictions for the commercialfishery from Leadbetter Point, Washington, to Cape Falcon, Oregon, areas follows: ``A single daily landing limit per vessel of 40 coho and 8chinook is permitted. Chinook must be delivered with the coho and all salmonmust be delivered in the area from Westport, Washington, to Cape Falcon,Oregon.''<ITAG tagnum="85">Adjustment to Recreational Fishery From the Queets River to LeadbetterPoint, Washington</ITAG>The 1989 recreational salmon fisheries from the U.S-Canada border to CapeFalcon, Oregon, are managed not to exceed an overall quota of 225,000 cohosalmon. This overall quota is partitioned into three subarea quotas andseasons. Impacts from quota overages or underages from each fishing periodor subarea are subtracted from or added to later fishing periods of thesame user group or transferred between the recreational and commercialfisheries in accordance with the framework allocation. The recreational fisheries for two subareas have been completed. Accordingto the best available information, the fishery in the subarea from LeadbetterPoint, Washington, to Cape Falcon Oregon, which closed on August 17, 1989(54 FR 37110, September 7, 1989), exceeded its subarea coho quota by about4,900 fish. The Salmon Technical Team analyzed the impacts from this quotaoverage to determine the amount to fish that should be subtracted fromthe subarea coho quota for the remaining open recreational fishery fromthe Queets River to Leadbetter Point, Washington. Accordingly, the subareacoho quota for the recreational fishery from the Queets River to LeadbetterPoint, Washington, was decreased by 4,900 fish, from 91,100 to 86,200 cohosalmon, effective 0001 hours local time, August 29, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="84">Reopenings</ITAG>Regulations governing the ocean salmon fisheries at 50 CFR 661.21(a)(2)state that ``If a fishery is closed under a quota before the end of a scheduledseason based on overestimate of actual catch, the Secretary will reopenthat fishery in as timely a manner as possible for all or part of the remainingoriginal season provided the Secretary finds that a reopening of the fisheryis consistent with the management objectives for the affected species andthe additional open period is not less than 24 hours.''<ITAG tagnum="85">Reopening of Commercial Fishery From Humbug Mountain, Oregon, to PuntaGorda, California</ITAG>The commercial fishery from Humbug Mountain, Oregon, to Punta Gorda, California,was closed at midnight, August 20, 1989, upon the projected attainmentof a subarea quota of 9,200 chinook salmon (54 FR 37110, September 7, 1989).Subsequent evaluation of landing data indicated that this closure was basedon an overestimate of actual catch. According to the best available information, 1,000 chinook salmon wereharvested by this fishery, leaving 8,200 fish unharvested in the subareaquota. This amount has been determined to be sufficient for reopening ofthe fishery beginning August 22, 1989.This action was taken in as timely a manner as possible for all of theremaining original season which is scheduled to end on August 31, 1989.Reopening of the commercial fishery in this subarea is consistent withthe management objectives for chinook salmon in this subarea.  <ITAG tagnum="85">Reopening of Recreational Fishery From Cape Falcon to Orford ReefRed Buoy, Oregon</ITAG>The recreational fishery from Cape Falcon to Orford Reef Red Buoy, Oregon,was closed at midnight, August 20, 1989, upon the projected attainmentof an overall recreational quota of 285,000 coho salmon in the area fromCape Falcon to the U.S.-Mexico border (54 FR 37110, September 7, 1989).(The recreational fishery from Orford Reef Red Buoy, Oregon, to the U.S.-Mexicoborder remains open as regularly scheduled.) Subsequent evaluation of landingdata indicated that this closure was based on an overestimate of actualcatch.According to the best available information, recreational catches of cohosalmon south of Cape Falcon totaled 275,900 fish through August 27, 1989.An estimated 2,100 coho salmon are projected to be harvested in the recreationalfishery south of Orford Reef Red Buoy, Oregon, during the remaining openperiod from August 28 through September 30, 1989. Therefore, 7,000 cohosalmon remain unharvested in the overall recreational coho quota. Thisamount has been determined to be sufficient for additional open periodof three days in the subarea from Cape Falcon to Orford Reef Red Buoy,Oregon. Therefore, this fishery was reopened on September 2-4, 1989.This action was taken in as timely a manner as possible for a part of theremaining original season which would be ended no later than September15, 1989. Reopening of the recreational fishery in this subarea is consistentwith the management objectives for coho salmon south of Cape Falcon, Oregon.<ITAG tagnum="84">Closures</ITAG>Regulations governing the ocean salmon fisheries at 50 CFR 661.21(a)(1)state that ``When a quota for the commercial or the recreational fishery,or both, for any salmon species in any portion of the fishery managementarea is projected by the Regional Director to be reached on or by a certaindate, the Secretary will, by notice issued under 661.23, close the commercialor recreational fishery, or both, for all salmon species in the portionof the fishery management area to which the quota applies as of the datethe quota is projected to be reached.''<ITAG tagnum="85">Closure of Commercial Fishery From the U.S.-Canada Border to CarrollIsland, Washington</ITAG>The 1989 commercial fishery for all salmon species in the subarea fromthe U.S.-Canada border to Carroll Island, Washington, commenced on August7, 1989, and was scheduled to continue through the earliest of August 31,1989, or the attainment of either a subarea quota of 40,000 coho salmonor an overall commercial quota of 47,500 chinook salmon north of Cape Falcon,Oregon.As indicated in the preseason notice, the Fraser River Panel of the PacificSalmon Commission maintained jurisdiction over the ocean commercial trollharvest of pink salmon during the 1989 fishing season. The Fraser RiverPanel promulgated regulations which superseded the preseason regulationsbetween 48anddegrees; N. lat. (approximately Carroll Island, Washington)and the U.S.-Canada border as follows. The fishery opened for 4 days from0001 hours local time August 7, 1989, through 2400 hours local time August10, 1989. The fishery was then reopened for 4 days from 0001 hours localtime August 16, 1989, through 2400 hours local time August 19, 1989.Based on the best available information, the commercial fishery catch inthe subarea from the U.S.-Canada border to Carroll Island, Washington,was projected to reach the subarea quota of 40,000 coho salmon by midnight,August 18, 1989. Therefore, the fishery in this subarea ways closed tofurther fishing effective 2400 hours local time, August 18, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="85">Closure of Recreational Fishery From the Queets River to LeadbetterPoint, Washington</ITAG>The 1989 recreational fishery for all salmon species in the subarea fromthe Queets River to Leadbetter Point, Washington, commenced on June 26,1989, and was scheduled to continue through the earliest of September 28,1989, or the attainment of either a subarea quota of 86,200 coho salmon(revised above) or an overall recreational quota of 47,500 chinook salmonnorth of Cape Falcon.Based on the best available information, the recreational fishery catchin the subarea was projected to reach the revised 86,200 coho salmon quotaby midnight, August 30, 1989. Therefore, the recreational fishery in thissubarea was closed to further fishing effective 2400 hours local time,August 30, 1989.The Regional Director consulted with representatives of the Pacific FisheryManagement Council, the Washington Department of Fisheries, the OregonDepartment of Fish and Wildlife, the California Department of Fish andGame, and the Fraser River Panel of the Pacific Salmon Commission regardingthese inseason adjustments, reopenings, and closures. The states of Washington,Oregon, and California will manage the commercial and recreational fisheriesin State waters adjacent to the affected areas of the EEZ in accordancewith this federal action. This notice does not apply to other fisherieswhich may be operating in other areas.In accordance with the revised inseason notice procedures of 50 CFR 661.20,661.21, and 661.23, actual notice to fishermen was given prior to the timeslisted above by telephone hotline number (206) 526-6667 and by U.S. CoastGuard Notice to Mariners broadcasts on Channel 16 VHF-FM and 2182 KHz.Because of the need for immediate action, the Secretary of Commerce hasdetermined that good cause exists for this notice to be issued withoutaffording a prior opportunity for public comment. Public comments on thisnotice will be accepted for 15 days after filing with the Office of theFederal Register, through October 20, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="84">Other Matters</ITAG>This action is authorized by 50 CFR 661.23 and is in compliance with ExecutiveOrder 12291.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 661</ITAG>Fisheries, Fishing, Indians.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> 16 U.S.C. 1801 <T3>et seq.</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: October 3, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">David S.
