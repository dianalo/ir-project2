(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Department of Energy officials have setguidelines for restarting the nuclear reactors that are the nation'ssource of tritium for nuclear warheads.   The guidelines, which include calls for unannounced inspectionsand setting training and safety standards consistent with those inplace for commercial nuclear reactors, clear the way for a restartof the three Savannah River Plant reactors _ the only ones nowcapable of supplying the nation's stockpile of tritium.   Due to problems encountered during an August restart ofP-Reactor, DOE officials have kept the reactors off line until theguidelines for reactor restarts could be written. The reactorsremain shut down for maintenance and safety upgrades.   On Tuesday, DOE Secretary John Herrington said the departmenthopes to restart K-Reactor at the Aiken, S.C., plant by late springor early summer.   Details on the new guidelines, which have not been made public,were obtained by the Morris News Service's Washington bureau,according to a story published in the Augusta-based MorrisCommunications Corp. newspapers.   The news service quoted unidentified sources in the Department ofEnergy as saying the restart of the K-Reactor and other reactorswill be keyed to implementation of the specific goals outlined inthe report.   Deadlines for complying with the goals set out in the report willbe established in a few weeks, the news service said.   The report calls for improvements in plant systems and componentsto assure that the reactors can operate as designed within pre-setmargins of safety.   Among its specific guidelines, the report calls for the additionof a fifth work shift per reactor, hiring shift supervisors withfour-year science or technical degrees, adding of an engineercertified by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to each shift,offering more advanced training for reactor operators and settingtraining standards that are consistent with the commercial nuclearindustry.   Another area of the report calls for standard maintenance andtesting procedures, new safety analysis criteria and revisedprocedures for reporting unusual reactor incidents to DOE officials.   The report also calls for improved on-site technical vigilanceand monitoring, including increased use of on-site engineers backedby outside experts and consultants; implementation of more technicaltraining programs; and requirements that reports be channeled toWashington.   Administration and congressional sources have said the nation'sstockpiles of tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen used toboost the yield of nuclear weapons, will be depleted badly withinsix months to two years.</TEXT></DOC>
