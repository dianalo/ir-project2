Eric Drexler in Engines ofCreation.andP;  Drexler and his supporters claim that while we have improved ourtechnology immensely, we are still the modern equivalent of primitiveschipping stones and bending heated metal.andP;  Our most impressive advances arestill related to the ways of old, using temperature (superconductors),chipping away at raw materials (smaller silicon processors), andstrengthening those raw materials (stronger and lighter alloys).andP;  If,however, we can control atomic and molecular interaction, we can taketechnology into realms where it will affect aging, cure diseases, helpreplenish the air supply, and produce one of the most important instrumentswe will ever use--the nanocomputer.andM;Basically, the concepts of nanotechnology tend to be analogous to what isgoing on in biotechnology.andP;  Bioresearchers commonly effect changes inbacteria by injecting them with viruses to produce specific results, fromgrowth hormones to enzymes.andP;  This is done by altering the DNA structure of anorganism in a methodical, even predictable, way.andP;  (Hence the stuff thatcritics of biogenetics worry about: preplanned mutations or improvements,depending on your outlook).andP;  Since DNA molecules are already beingmanipulated within organisms, it seems to the nanotechnologists thatmolecular control over inorganic matter shouldn't be too far away.andM;But inorganic matter doesn't grow and replicate like bacteria or cells, thecritics cry.andP;  What about crystalline structures? counters thenanotechnologist.andP;  Such materials seem to grwo in a very orderly way, formingorganized and patterned structures.andP;  If molecules of all types could becontrolled, they could create everything from skyscrapers to space shuttles,as long as the necessary types of molecules were available to bond and build.andO;How would the atoms know the difference between a skyscraper and a spaceshuttle?andP;  Again, precedents are already available in even the simplestbiotechnology--penicillin affects certain bacteria, but it doesn't affectliving cells.andP;  Such controls and selectivity are possible within the buildingof molecular machines.andM;This brings us to assemblers--the &quot;how&quot; in using molecules to build things.andO;Assemblers are molecules formed together as miniature machines to achieve acertain function, whether it be linking other molecules to formsmooth-as-silk steel or making an assembly line to create unbreakable plasticjust millimeters thick.andP;  Machines so small they are invisible could becreated by linking molecules in precise formations.andM;Is all this beginning to sound like science fiction?andP;  You bet.andP;  You canalmost picture the lab scene: &quot;Hey Bill, over here, under the electronmicroscope...you've got to see this...it's a fully automated General Motorsproduction plant...and it's turning out Saturn cars just a few moleculeswide!&quot;andP;  This lends itself to wide-open speculation.andP;  But nanotechnologyproponents claim nothing is wrong with that.andP;  After all, look how eerilycorrect such writers as Jules Verne and H.G.andP;  Wells were in describingpotential advances in science decades ago.andP;  It really shouldn't sound thatfar off the mark: today's microprocessors contain thousands of microscopiccomponents that form chips smaller than Mandamp;Ms.andP;  The room-sized Eniac of the1950s is already the fingernail-sized 80386 of the 1980s.andM;Enter nanotechnology.andP;  Present-day computers, built with micron technology,have unavoidable molecular flaws.andP;  They also contain processors built in atwo-dimensional or flat configuration.andP;  In much the same way thatbiotechnologists create predetermined bacterial functions, thenanotechnologist could create interconnecting circuits.andP;  Arranging themolecular level of a semiconductor design would allow for three-dimensionaland more precise circuitry.andM;At this level, computer activation need not be electrical.andP;  Charles Babbage'sfirst ideas for computers were mechanical, and some of the first electricalcomputers employed mechanical switches.andP;  As long as binary code istransmitted (in 1s and 0s) it really doesn't matter how it's enabled.andO;Mechanical or chemical reactions could make molecular-sized computersincredibly efficient, even though these methods are about 100,000 timesslower than electric signals.andP;  But since the distance in travel area is1/1,000,000 times less than electric signals must go, processing time willimprove considerably.andM;Nanocomputers would control assemblers, but what would control thenanocomputers?andP;  The answer, say nanotechnologists, lies in the AI realm.andO;With large-scale computers working at incredible speeds on problems ofmolecular interaction, humans become instigators, but do not deal with theatomic-size particles that will eventually become fully operational machines.andO;Just as CAD/CAM and CAE take some of the human intervention out of variousdesign and production phases, so will the next generation of AI help createnanocomputers and nanomachines.andM;SECURITYandM;It is a fact of life that every company in every industry uses keys, codes,and commands for protection.andP;  But with the nasty viruses that have popped upin the last year, computer security is at a premium.andP;  It's time to employstricter measures for controlling access.andM;A security product known as the EyeDentification System recognizes users bysomething far more advanced than their registration numbers or evenfingerprints: the human retinal eye pattern.andP;  A potential user's eye isscanned by an instrument using infrared light that records and stores thepattern of blood vessels.andP;  Then, to gain access to a building, car, orsoftware application, the user looks into a device that scns the eye again,matching the retinal pattern to the one stored in memory.andP;  Since very fewpeople are willing to alter the inside of their eyeballs permanently or areborn with the exact same biometric features, the chances of false access area mere 0.0001%.andM;What a great way to foil hackers with viral infections!andP;  Or how about usingthis for copy protection?andP;  Hey Lotus!andP;  Are you listening?andP;  You could includeone of these with every 1-2-3 package to ward off illegal pirating.andM;MATHEMATICSandM;I don't know about you, but every time I turn around, it seems somebody hascome up with a new form of mathematics to alter our understanding ofnumerical relations.andP;  We are fast approaching a period when there is no suchtime as real time.andP;  In many cases, real time is actually too slow (accesstimes or response times are faster than real time when you consider what goeson to make the result appear to be real time).andP;  For most of the computingworld, real time would be a dream come true after hours, minutes, and evenseconds of waiting for our machines to grind out their reports andcalculations.andM;Newer calculations help speed up these things, and therefore we get fastercomputer systems.andP;  Thus, math is an integral part of getting computertechnology to give us more, faster.andP;  Some discoveries in the last two yearsat the Rochester Institute of Technology in New York even change the waycalculations are done to save time.andP;  Using a non-Euclidean geometry they havedeveloped, a group of RIT researchers solved 99 integer equations with 132unknowns for a (0, 1)-solution in 12 hours.andP;  That sounds fairly unimpressive,but it has been estimated that simple brute-force computer techniquesattempting to solve the same equations would take several million centuries.andO;Compare this concept to the idea of billions of floating-point operations persecond and see if that doesn't screw up your sense of real time.andM;Like I said, math makes all the difference.andP;  At least that's what they toldmy parents when I got a D in college calculus.andM;HYPERMEDIAandM;Everybody seems to have a different term for this goal of computing, but itall boils down to using information from diverse media via multidimensionallinks.andP;  While we currently use information of one type (text files, forinstance) at one time (not that many people are multitasking as a way oflife--yet), hypermedia allows computer files and video and audio data to beaccessed from one database point.andM;I really think all current forms of computing will work toward a common goal,such as hypermedia.andP;  Some of the other technologies I've mentioned will haveimplications far into the future, but hypermedia can evolve by using existingtechnology as a foothold.andM;The possibilities of combining our workable technologies are limitless.andO;Imagine accessing a database listing for Dustin Hoffman.andP;  Along with thislisting you might have the options of calling up his resume and film history.andO;You might even be able to have a digitized photograph attached to thislisting.andP;  But let's take it a step further.andP;  Once you've done all this, youthen access--across media--a video disk or CD-ROM that presents you withselected clips of his acting from movies such as Tootsie, Midnight Cowboy, orRain Man.andM;Now apply this to more pertinent situations, such as hiring new people,checking the specs on a new car, seeing film clips and printed stories onnews items, researching notable events and figures, and accessing newsstories, biographical and topical inforamtion, and film clips or interviewsfrom those events.andP;  You need background on Winston Churchill?andP;  Yourhypermedia database provides you with the information you currently get fromdatabases and includes video and audio information.andP;  With the introduction ofnew features to products such as Apple's Hypercard, this may not be all thatfar away.andM;With these thoughts of tomorrow's technology in mind, it's easy to believewe'll always be pushing the envelope--or chasing the horizon--of technologyas we know it today.andM;Harvey P.
