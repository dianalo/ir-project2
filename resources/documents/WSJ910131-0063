Yet tensions remain high between increasingly nervousRussian groups and newly assertive Estonians, Latvians andLithuanians. Fears now focus on Friday, which is to be thefirst day of joint patrols by Soviet soldiers and localpolice. Some politicians here think the patrols are a firststep toward martial law.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The danger hasn't passed: We only bought some time,&quot; saysMr. Ruutel. &quot;We don't know how and when the next threat willcome, but the political questions aren't solved. With eachday that a solution is postponed, the threat of an explosionhere rises. Even if the center wants to avoid violence, wedon't have any guarantees that top leaders have the abilityto handle the situation here.&quot;   In an apparent attempt to ease tensions yesterday, Soviettroops were seen leaving the Lithuanian capital of Vilniusand Lithuanian officials said a pullout could lead to newtalks with Moscow on the Baltic republics' demands forindependence. The Soviet Interior Minister Boris Pugo said inan article that all paratroopers have left the Baltic regionand two-thirds of the &quot;black beret&quot; Interior Ministry troopshad also been withdrawn.   Moscow's easing has angered hard-line elements of thenon-Estonian population, however. &quot;I say it openly: We havebeen betrayed,&quot; says Vladmir Yarovoi, director of theDvigatel plant, one of the largest and the politically mostimportant of Estonia's factories. &quot;The center, ComradeGorbachev, doesn't protect us, so now we must learn to defendourselves.&quot;   Mr. Yarovoi is the chairman of a coordinating council forseveral organizations that claim to represent the majority ofthe 600,000 non-Estonians here, which account for some 40% ofEstonia's population. He is Mr. Ruutel's chief opponent inEstonia.   The Dvigatel factory has become a center of opposition tothe independence-minded Estonian government. The Sovietdefense ministry runs the plant, which makes washingmachines, building goods, machine tools and elements for thenuclear power industry that are secret. Mr. Yarovoi says eventhe number of Dvigatel workers is a state secret (localofficials guess at about 10,000 of which only 100 areEstonian). Plant workers are forming self-defense committees,which Estonians fear will be the hard-line's fifth column.Mr. Yarovoi says they are merely unarmed neighborhoodpatrols.   In the predawn hours of Jan. 14, Mr. Yarovoi concedes,Dvigatel workers gathered to intercept Russian republicleader Boris Yeltsin, who had come to Tallinn to challengeMr. Gorbachev by recognizing the independence of the Balticstates and offering them assistance. Mr. Ruutel says that Mr.Yeltsin had reason to fear for his safety that day, but Mr.Yarovoi says the workers only wanted &quot;to invite him toexplain his actions. Instead he sneaked away in the middle ofthe night -- afraid to talk to his own people.&quot;   Inside one of Dvigatel's huge cement buildings, enteredthrough a passage underneath a 50-foot-tall image of Lenin,the plant's strike committee is meeting. They have delivereddemands for a price freeze, for the abolition of the newEstonian constitution and for the immediate resignation ofthe Estonian Parliament and government. Mr. Yarovoi saysofficial refusal to discuss these demands constitutes aprovocation that might bring violence.   Members of the committee argue that free market economicsare engineered to drive their plant to economic ruin andforce Russian workers out. The Russians say they should betreated by Estonians as a threatened minority, not asdespised occupiers whom Estonians charge have corrupted theirculture, slowed their development and polluted their lands.   Boris Leensov, a leader of the strike committee, says thatRussians make up 85% of the construction industry, 80% of itstransportation workers and produce all of its energy. &quot;We arethe productive force here and could cause much moredifficulty than we have thus far,&quot; he says.   Lurking behind all such statements is a barely concealedhope that the central government will reassert itself. One ofthe workers proudly shows off a sign used in that day'sdemonstration. It reads, &quot;Comrade Gorbachev, take a lessonfrom Bush: Be resolute.&quot;   A chemical engineer, Alexander Taraykin, asks that Mr.Gorbachev follow the example of Abraham Lincoln in keepinghis union together. &quot;Lincoln made a name for himself throughsuch means,&quot; he says.   Estonians view matters differently. They watched theannexation of Kuwait by Iraq and drew parallels with whathappened in Estonia when it was annexed by the Soviet Unionin 1940, says Lennart Meri, Estonia's foreign minister. TheEstonian Parliament even called for the creation of anEstonian Kuwaiti Corps to fight alongside the U.S. and itsallies, but the effort was dropped because of a lack offunding, problems with visas and the Soviet Union's desirethat all citizens remain on the sidelines.   Estonians also have turned cautiously to preparing fortheir own defense. They have established a home guard of some3,000 men that protects government buildings from the sort ofattacks that hit Latvia and Lithuania. Yet it would be animpotent force against the Red Army. &quot;Perhaps it is not astate secret to disclose that our army's armament consists ofsix Kalashnikovs,&quot; says Mr. Meri.   Many Russians in Estonia support independence, but theyare unhappy about how Estonians are going about it. &quot;TheEstonians made a mistake in the beginning by not reaching outto the Soviet population,&quot; says Pavel Gaemoskin, a Russianmember of the Estonian Parliament. &quot;This allowed the old lineof the Communist Party to gain influence over them.&quot; Hebelieves half of the Russians of Estonia would supportindependence if they received guarantees that they would betreated equally.   Andres Tarand, the director of the Tallinn BotanicalGardens, reminds Estonians they have avoided violence likethat which struck Latvia and Lithuania partly because theydidn't confront Soviet authorities head-on but insteadpursued a course of negotiation.   Like other Estonians, Mr. Tarand fears his people'sextinction. That may seem overly dramatic to the outsider,but Estonians quote figures that show their numbers weregreater before World War II, after which they were decimatedby war, deportations, executions and immigration. They citenewer statistics that show the faster rate of Russian birthin their republic; Russian children are already the majorityin Estonian grade schools.   The immediate fear of Estonians is that they will fail toescape the Soviet Union before it slides into a civil warthat could spread to the republic.</TEXT></DOC>
