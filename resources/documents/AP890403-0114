Army officials also have repeatedly said troops open fire onlywhen their lives are in danger from barrages of stones.   Among the six troops killed in the uprising, one has died duringa stone-throwing incident. His skull was crushed by a concreteblock dropped from a roof. More than 400 Palestinians have died inthe revolt, most by Israeli gunfire.   But some soldiers said they rarely felt danger from the stonesand added that anger or a hurt sense of national pride could incitethem to react violently.   ``You feel like you're playing a game of tag _ we can run aroundand make you run after us,'' said Neil Shergin, 25, an immigrantfrom Rockville, Md., who spent about two months in the Gaza Stripand West Bank.   ``They're quite courageous. If I saw a number of soldiers withautomatic weapons in their hands I'd be asking what I could do forthem and not what I could throw at them.''   Soldiers also say that orders on when to open fire or beatprotesters are too vague, leaving too much to the discretion ofindividual soldiers in the heat of a clash.   Controversy over these orders has emerged in the stillunfinished trial of four troops charged with beating a 42-year-oldPalestinian man to death in the Gaza Strip while conducting anarrest last August.   Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, the Israeli military chief of staff,acknowledged at the trial that standing orders left ``many grayareas.''   ``There can be some incident where commands are not clear, evenwith the best of soldiers,'' Shomron testified. A civilian whoresists arrest can be beaten, he said, ``but when someone stopsresisting, that is a matter of opinion.''   Some 50 troops have been formally charged or punished forillegal beatings and shootings during the uprising. The armyacknowledges others have been punished by officers in individualunits, but no record is available of how many.   On the other hand, about 60 soldiers have been tried forrefusing duty in the occupied territories. The small number resultsfrom Israelis' pride in their citizen army, in which all Jewish menand women do compulsory duty. Men serve in the reserves until age55.   The army has started to replace some reserve soldiers in theterritories with border police to cut down reserve duty, which roseto 62 days from the normal 42 days last year because of theuprising. They also hope the border police, better trained in riotcontrol, can cut down the number of civilian casualties.   Army authorities have acknowledged that some casualties growfrom soldiers' fits of temper.   ``I know it happens and we try to prevent it,'' said Brig. Gen.Ehud Gross, the army's chief education officer who is in charge ofa new program to help soldiers cope with their role as policemen.   ``This is not a normal situation for military forces who havebeen fighting for survival for 40 years in real wars,'' he said.``We have to face something new in which we really cannot use thepower we have.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, April 9</NOTE></DOC>
