DALE NELSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A proposed constitutional amendment banningabortions remains a long-range goal of the anti-abortion movementbut it is taking a back seat to the battle in the Supreme Court.   Proposals for such an amendment were the main rallying cry ofthe anti-abortion movement for years and have been endorsed by bothPresident Bush and former President Reagan.   But Bush now says he will probably wait for the Supreme Court'sdecision before undertaking any anti-abortion initiatives, andReagan is turning to other issues.   An anti-abortion amendment was rejected by the Senate nearly sixyears ago. The proposal has been reintroduced in the House andSenate, but no action is scheduled.   The Supreme Court, however, will hear arguments April 26 in acase in which the state of Missouri, the Bush administration andothers seek to limit or reverse the court's 16-year-old ruling thatwomen have a constitutional right to abortion.   ``Especially in recent years, the focus has been much more onthe court itself and the likelihood of a reversal rather than onthe much more onerous method of amending the Constitution,''Douglas Johnson, legislative director of National Right to Life,said in an interview.   The only time an anti-abortion amendment has ever been votedupon in either house of Congress was on June 28, 1983, when itfailed on a 50-49 vote in the Senate, well short of the requiredtwo-thirds majority.   In the House, no such measure has ever emerged from theJudiciary Committee, which anti-abortion leaders say isconsiderably more liberal on the abortion rights issue than theHouse as a whole.   If it received the necessary majority in both houses, theamendment would still require ratification by three-fourths of thestates before it became part of the Constitution.   The amendment that failed in 1983, sponsored by Sen. Orrin G.Hatch, R-Utah, would have provided simply, ``A right to abortion isnot secured by this Constitution.'' That would have left it up tostate legislatures to decide whether to make abortions legal.   The vote came just two weeks after the Supreme Court had struckdown a number of state and local limits on abortion in line withthe reasoning of its 1973 decision, known as Roe v. Wade. Sincethen, the court's conservative wing has been strengthened by theaddition of Justices Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy,encouraging abortion foes to believe it may reverse position.   Johnson said the high court has reversed itself on majorconstitutional issues about 150 times, whereas court rulings havebeen overturned by constitutional amendment only four times, onissues including the 18-year voting age and the constitutionalityof the income tax.   Reagan urged the Senate of six years ago to ``make its voiceheard against abortion on demand ... whether by statute orconstitutional amendment'' and lobbied senators by telephone on theissue.   On his flight to California after leaving office Jan. 20, helisted ``a change with regard to the abortion situation'' as amongthe issues he planned to be taking ``to the people'' as anex-president.   His spokesman, Mark Weinberg, said, however, that the formerpresident has not mentioned the abortion amendment in preparedspeeches he has delivered since leaving office, although he hasplugged a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget anda line-item veto for presidents.   ``I am certain, though, that as he said on the airplane he willdiscuss that issue in coming months,'' Weinberg said by telephonefrom Los Angeles. ``He has spoken about some issues, and will bespeaking about others.''   Reagan has endorsed the amendment backed by National Right toLife, which would allow abortions only when necessary to save thelife of the mother. Bush has said he would broaden the exception toinclude cases of rape and incest.   Bush, asked on Jan. 27 whether he planned any new anti-abortioninitiatives or would wait for the Supreme Court, said, ``I thinkprobably wait, but I have been pledged, as you know, to anamendment. But I'd like to see the Supreme Court decision as soonas possible.''   On Jan. 25, Sen. Jake Garn, R-Utah, introduced the latestversion of the anti-abortion amendment. This amendment, morefar-reaching than the one defeated in 1983, would declare theunborn to be persons and provide, ``No unborn person shall bedeprived of life by any person'' with the exception that it wouldnot bar ``a law permitting only those medical procedures requiredto prevent the death of the mother.'' Similar measures have beenintroduced in the House. Neither the House nor Senate JudiciaryCommittee has scheduled any action.   ``I frankly do not think that there is any chance, with thecurrent makeup of Congress, that a human life amendment would pass.I don't think it would even get out of committee,'' said NancyBroff, legislative and political director of the National AbortionRights Action League.   Johnson said Right to Life regards such an amendment as ``ourlong term goal, but we would be happy for incremental progress, andwe see overturning Roe v. Wade as a big step toward that goal.''   Meanwhile one state has adopted an anti-abortion constitutionalamendment. Arkansas voters approved an amendment in November, by amargin of 58 to 42 per cent, making it ``state policy to protectthe life of every unborn child from conception until birth to theextent permitted by the federal Constitution.''   So long as the Supreme Court interprets the Constitution asguaranteeing women the right to have abortions, the Arkansasmeasure can't be applied to prohibit them. If the court reversesitself, action by the state legislature would probably be necessaryto make them illegal, observers in Little Rock have said. Arkansaslaws currently permit abortions so long as they are performed bydoctors.</TEXT></DOC>
