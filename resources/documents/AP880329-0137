(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Michael Dukakis battled Jesse Jackson aswell as increasing doubts about his Democratic presidentialcandidacy in the Connecticut primary on Tuesday. Vice PresidentGeorge Bush coasted on the Republican side as vanquished rival BobDole readied to quit the race.   Massachusetts Gov. Dukakis and Bush both aimed to cementsix-state New England sweeps, but their similarities ended there.   Dukakis led Jackson, the man with momentum in the race, as wellas Sen. Albert Gore Jr. and Sen. Paul Simon with about 50 percentof the vote in one pre-election poll.   The governor hoped for a victory big enough to reassure theskeptics after his landslide loss to Jackson in the Michigancaucuses last weekend and his third-place finish in the Illinoisprimary on March 15.   Jackson aimed for a strong second-place showing that wouldembarrass Dukakis in his own back yard and give fresh impetus tothe campaign that has been the Democratic surprise of the year.   Gore spent an estimated $75,000 on television advertising inhopes of demonstrating strength in the Northeast.   In contrast to the Democratic disarray, Bush's Super Tuesdayspectacular showing on March 8 turned his campaign into a statelymarch toward the nomination. Dole, his once-strong tormenter,arranged a withdrawal speech in Washington while the polls wereopen in Connecticut.   That left Pat Robertson as Bush's only surviving challenger. Buthe has signaled that he is a candidate in name only, and isspending the time between now and the GOP convention developing anetwork of supporters for 1992.   Connecticut's primary offered 35 delegates to the RepublicanNational Convention, and 52 on the Democratic side.   Before the returns from Connecticut were read, The AssociatedPress delegate count looked this way:   Bush had 788 delegates, to 17 for Robertson. It takes 1,139 toclaim the nomination.   Jackson and Dukakis both had 606.5, with 2,082 needed to gainthe Democratic nomination. Gore had 365 and Simon 169.   Simon made little effort in Connecticut, and Rep. RichardGephardt dropped out of the Democratic race on Monday.   But Dukakis was still suffering the effects of wounds receivedin Illinois and Michigan. And anything less than an overpoweringvictory in next-door Connecticut would do little to quell thecomplaints that his candidacy lacks spark.   Thus, Connecticut looked merely like a prelude to biggerDemocratic battles to come.   Gore and Simon were planning costly television advertising inWisconsin ahead of next Tuesday's primary there. Jackson wasrunning virtually even with Dukakis in polls there, taken beforethe former civil rights leader scored his Michigan landslide.   Further away were the two big industrial state battles in NewYork and Pennsylvania. Thus, despite Gephardt's withdrawal, theDemocratic race seemed as muddled as ever.   Even before Dole's speech, Bush had begun turning his attentiontoward the fall campaign. Campaign officials said he had decided toname business executive Fred V. Malek to oversee his activities atthe Republican National Convention.   In a sign of gathering Republican unity, former contender JackKemp returned to the campaign to endorse Bush at a news conferencein Wisconsin.   Dole's withdrawal came less than two months after he handilydefeated Bush in the lead-off Iowa caucuses. But he then lost NewHampshire's primary and three weeks later, was shut out in all 17Super Tuesday states.   The Democratic race couldn't have been more confusing.   Michigan gave the momentum to Jackson. But he is a black,liberal candidate whom many party officials believe cannot possiblywin the White House, and thus should not be nominated.   His enhanced standing in the race prompted an extraordinarypublic debate among party officials about the possibility ordesirability of organizing a stop-Jackson movement.   Jackson campaigned vigorously in Connecticut as he tried tobuild on the momentum he received from his win in Michigan. Hesometimes seemed to aim his message at the party's bigwigs aroundthe country as well as at the voters of a single state.   ``If at the end of California, we have the most popular votesand the most delegate votes, becoming the nominee is logical andproper,'' he said on Monday.   He challenged the notion that party leaders could turn tosomeone else at the convention.   ``They would not have given me the nomination. I would haveearned it from the people,'' he said.   Dukakis had spent considerable energy in recent daysconstructing a bandwagon designed to carry him to the nomination.He was winning endorsement after endorsement to go with campaignorganization and financing that is the envy of other contenders _and was backed in Connecticut by Gov. William O'Neill and Sen.Christopher Dodd.   But his poor showing in Michigan prompted several party leadersto publicly question his ability to generate support. And it hasraised anew speculation about a deadlocked party convention castingabout for a non-candidate to be its nominee.   Dukakis' aides were confident their man would win Connecticut _but penciled in a few additional campaign appearances on Mondayafter the results of Michigan had sunk in.   For his part, Dukakis was reluctant to take on Jackson directly.   ``I'm not running against (Jackson) and he is not runningagainst me. We are running for the presidency,'' he told onequestioner.   Gore initially said he hoped to surprise Dukakis in Connecticut.But he seemed to have shifted his focus to Wisconsin and the NewYork primary on April 19 in his bid to show he can attract votesoutside his native South.   Simon, a favorite son winner in Illinois on March 15, decided tostay out of Connecticut and point instead toward Wisconsin. Aidessaid he might reassess his campaign _ shorthand for withdrawal _ ifhe did poorly there.</TEXT></DOC>
