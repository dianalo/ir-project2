Although relatively few abortions are conducted in publichospitals, advocates say they provide a vital link in the abortionchain by training physicians, counseling patients and performingabortions for poor women and those who are considered high medicalrisks.   ``If you lose public hospitals, you lose all abortions,'' saidAlice Kirkman, a spokeswoman for the National Abortion Federation,an association of abortion providers.   The Supreme Court last week upheld key provisions of Missouri'slaw limiting abortions, including a ban on most abortions in publichospitals.   Of the 1.6 million abortions performed in the United States in1985, 87 percent took place in clinics or doctor's offices, whileonly 13 percent were in hospitals, according to thepro-abortion-rights Alan Guttmacher Institute.   Only 265 of the 1,191 hospitals performing abortions wereclassified as public.   ``You're really not talking about a major proportion of allabortions,'' said Larry Gage, president of the National Associationof Public Hospitals. ``But that doesn't mean that public hospitals... aren't an important part of the process.''   The 85 members of his association train 20 percent of all medicalresidents in the country, Gage said. The NAPH represents mostlylarge, urban, government-run hospitals.   ``These are enormously important training grounds for ourobstetricians and gynecologists, people who will be called upon toperform abortions _ if they remain legal,'' he said.   Missouri's law bars public facilities and public employees fromperforming an abortion unless it is necessary to save a woman's life.   Advocates on both sides of the issue say life-threateningpregnancies are rare and that the ruling will effectively haltabortions in Missouri's public hospitals.   The most drastic scenarios assume that the Missouri law willsweep like wildfire through the other 49 state legislatures, whichfew say seems likely. Some experts say last week's ruling is mainlyimportant as a precurser of more sweeping action by the SupremeCourt next year.   In the short term, the ruling won't change many lives. Missouriofficials so far have applied the law to only two public hospitals,which together accounted for only 90 of the state's 17,382 abortionsin 1988.   In other places with more liberal abortion policies, publichospitals take a more active role. More than 8,000 of New YorkCity's 100,000 abortions in 1985 were performed in city-runfacilities. But New York is unlikely to outlaw such abortions.   The ultimate effect of the Missouri law is difficult to gauge, inpart because the Supreme Court ruling raises a sticky question: Whatis a public facility?   The short answer is that nobody seems quite sure.   Is it a government owned and operated hospital? Yes. Is it aprivately owned hospital that relies heavily on public funds?Probably. Is it a privately owned hospital that accepts onlyMedicare payments? Who knows.   ``It's confusing to me,'' conceded Mark Roebuck, a spokesman forthe Missouri Department of Health. ``I'm trying to find answers toit myself.''   ``It's not surprising that there's confusion,'' Gage said.``There was confusion in the decision itself.''   Gage referred to a concurring opinion by Justice Sandra DayO'Connor in which she brushed aside an argument that the law couldlead to abortion bans at private hospitals whose only public subsidywas public water and sewage lines.   Whether such a ban would be constitutional ``need not be decidedhere,'' she said.   James Bopp, general counsel for the National Right to LifeCommittee, laughed at the sewage argument. ``I wouldn't go thatfar,'' he said. ``I don't think that's what's contemplated here.''   Yet Bopp said he did think the Missouri law could be applied toprivate hospitals that accept Medicare payments _ a definition thatwould include virtually every hospital in the country.   He compared the abortion issue to civil rights cases in whichcourts have found that institutions that discriminate cannot receivefederal funds.   ``There's an important public policy in prohibitingdiscrimination based on race,'' Bopp said, ``and in our view there'san important public policy in choosing childbirth over abortion.''</TEXT></DOC>
