RI in fission yeasthas previously been considered as a specific type of premutational lesioncapable of (1) being replicated as such and (2) reverting at an appreciablerate to the normal state as well as changing into a stable mutation.In the present work genetic analysis of a previously studied RI-carryingstrain showed this strain to be a diploid, most probably heterozygousfor a recessive mutation. It was possible to construct other unstableheterozygous strains segregating predetermined mutants but not to induceRI by UV-irradiation of haploid cells. Thus evidence is presented againstthe premutational nature of RI in fission yeast.</TEXT></DOC>
