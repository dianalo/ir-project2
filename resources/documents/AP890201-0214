The French government last year denied widespread reports that itwon the hostages' release in part by agreeing to pardon AnisNaccache, who led four other pro-Iranian attackers in a failedattempt to kill Shapour Bakhtiar, Iran's last prime minister beforethe Islamic Revolution.   Naccache's appeal was made in a statement issued late Wednesdaynight by his lawyer Antoine Comte.   French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas plans to go to Iran onSunday for the first high-level visit since diplomatic relationswere restored last year as part of the hostage deal.   ``I ask the Iranian government, which guaranteed the accordbetween France and the parties concerned during the liberation ofthe hostages, to remind France of its engagements,'' the statementsaid. ``It is inadmissible to say that relations between the twocountries are good while five soldiers of Islam are still in Frenchprisons.''   Naccache and three other men were sentenced to life in prison forthe July 1980 assault on Bakhtiar, which left a bystander and apoliceman dead and three other police officers wounded.   The fifth member of Naccache's team got a 20-year-sentence.Bakhtiar, who lives in exile in Paris, was not hurt.   French authorities believed that Naccache's orders to assassinatethe former prime minister came from senior Iranian officials.   While France was seeking to win freedom for its hostages inLebanon, President Francois Mitterrand said publicly that he wouldbe willing to pardon Naccache, but only as part of a deal in whichall French hostages were freed.   Last May, when journalist Jean-Paul Kauffmann and diplomatsMarcel Carton and Marcel Fontaine were released by their pro-Iraniancaptors in Beirut, Mitterrand and then-Premier Jacques Chirac deniedthat Naccache's release was part of the deal.   Kauffmann, Carton and Fontaine were held by a group calledIslamic Jihad, which is still holding some of the 15 Westernhostages in Lebanon. The longest held is American journalist TerryAnderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press.He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.   Reports that France made important concessions to get itshostages back drew criticism, especially in Britain, on the groundsthat such deals could make it more difficult to win freedom forother hostages without making similar bargains.   French officials insisted they agreed only to restore goodrelations and to repay a $1 billion loan originally made by the shahof Iran for a uranium enrichment plant, and frozen after theAyatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's Islamic revolution.</TEXT></DOC>
