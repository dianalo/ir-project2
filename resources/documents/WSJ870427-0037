George Deukmejian to add more than 200 toxic chemicals to the list of 29 that the state had drawn up in response to an initiative on last November's ballot.    Environmental attorneys representing the AFL-CIO, the Environmental Defense Fund and other groups had filed suit arguing that the governor's &quot;short list&quot; excluded materials known to cause cancer in animals. Proposition 65, passed last November, required a list of chemicals that would include toxic chemicals reported by health agencies to cause cancer in both humans and animals. Under the initiative, disposal of these toxins is prohibited unless an exemption is granted by the state, and warnings must be given when the public is exposed to these substances.    The ruling by Judge Roger K. Warren said that the governor improperly limited his list to materials known to cause cancer in humans.    Stephen P. Berzon, lead attorney for the AFL-CIO, hailed the ruling as a victory for environmentalists and called the governor's position limiting the list &quot;ridiculous.&quot;    Thomas Warriner, California's undersecretary for health and welfare, said his office was reviewing the ruling and would decide soon whether to expand the carcinogens list or to appeal. </TEXT></DOC>
