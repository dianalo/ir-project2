Ms. Claybrook now is president of Public Citizen, a policy groupoften critical of the Reagan administration.   ``It is totally absurd but expected from Joan Claybrook,'' saidTransportation Department spokesman Ron DeFore. ``Joan hasconsistently been a critic of NHTSA under this administration, andthis study, this interim report, does not support her point ofview.''   The department, in a report presented to Congress on Friday,said raw data showed only a 1 percentage point difference intraffic fatality increases on rural interstate highways having thehigher speed limit and those retaining the 55 mph national speedlimit adopted in 1974.   ``We're just not finding any distinction,'' Burnley said after aspeech this week to the Society of Automotive Engineers.   The study, however, analyzed the traffic data in several ways,and some of the results suggest the higher speed limit results in ahigher fatality rate, said the Insurance Institute for HighwaySafety, an insurance industry organization.   Institute President Brian O'Neill said the most reliable findingin the report used a mathematical model to examine traffic fatalitydata since 1975.   That method concluded that fatalities on rural interstatehighways increased by 20 percent in the first four or five fullmonths following adoption of the higher speed limit compared withthe fatalities that would otherwise have been expected.   Most of the states raised their speed limits on rural highwaysin April and May of last year.   ``I think there is no question that these numbers areconfirming, unfortunately, what all the prior evidence suggestedwas going to happen, that the higher speed limits would translateinto higher speeds,'' O'Neill said.   Using other methods, the study found:   _During the first nine months of 1987, traffic fatalities onhighways with the 65 mph limit rose 18 percent from a year earlierin 37 states that had adopted the higher speed, compared with a 17percent increase in 11 states that had not.   _From Jan. 1, 1987, to the time of the speed limit change,fatalities had increased 10 percent from the corresponding period ayear earlier. After the speed limit was raised through Sept. 30,1987, fatalities were 23 percent higher than a year earlier, thestudy said.   _The 23 percent increase in fatalities on rural interstatesafter the speed limit was changed compared with a 13 percentdecline in fatalities on urban interstates during the same periodand a 5 percent decline in fatalities on non-interstate roads.   Individual states also showed a great variety intraffic-fatality patterns on rural interstates from June 1987through September 1987, the study said.   Ten states that increased the speed limit had fewer fatalitiesthan in the corresponding period a year earlier. They wereArkansas, Colorado, Illinois, Missouri, Montana, New Hampshire,North Dakota, Texas, Washington and West Virginia. Georgia, whichdid not raise speed limits, also showed a decline.   Nine states that kept the lower speed limit during the periodhad more fatalities. They were Connecticut, Hawaii, Massachusetts,Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island andVirginia.   O'Neill said that data could be misinterpreted as meaning speedlimits contributed to increased deaths in some areas but not inothers. ``The fact is that fatality figures are small enough ineach state for wide fluctuations to be expected,'' he said.   On all highways, the number of fatalities increased in 1987, butthe number of miles traveled by vehicles on the nation's highwayswas substantially higher than in 1986, Burnley said in a speechthis week.</TEXT></DOC>
