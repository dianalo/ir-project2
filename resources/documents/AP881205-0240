The U.S. Geological Survey in 1985 predicted a quake measuring 6on the Richter scale for the Parkfield area, which has been shakenso regularly it has become a prime site for experiments inearthquake forecasting.   ``There is a good possibility that it's going to be larger thanpredicted,'' said Ralph Archuleta, a University of California, SantaBarbara, seismologist who concluded that a quake on the San AndreasFault near Parkfield could measure 7.2 on the Richter scale.   UCLA geophysicist David D. Jackson says the quake might to besmaller than the U.S.G.S.-predicted moderate temblor, but couldtrigger a magnitude 8 great quake along a longer stretch of thefault _ the long-feared ``big one.''   Despite their studies of pent-up stress along the fault,published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, U.S.G.S.stands by its prediction _ the first and only long-term quakeprediction endorsed by the national and California earthquakeprediction evaluation councils.   ``From the beginning, all official statements have said there isa possibility of a larger event, but we think that possibility issmall,'' maybe 2 percent, said seismologist Allan Lindh, chiefscientist at the Geological Survey's Parkfield experiment.   Geologist Kerry Sieh, a quake prediction pioneer at theCalifornia Institute of Technology, agrees with Archuleta that thequake could be a major jolt rather than a moderate or great quake.But there is an outside chance even a moderate quake could grow, ortrigger a great quake within hours, he said.   The predicted magnitude 6 quake near Parkfield, 180 milesnorthwest of Los Angeles, is expected to cause little damage in thetown of about 34 residents, and the surrounding, sparsely populatedCholame Valley, which has experienced such jolts roughly every 22years, most recently in 1966.   The regularity of the quakes spurred the U.S.G.S. prediction,based on the theory that a ``characteristic earthquake'' occursevery time enough stress has built up on the 20-mile-long Parkfieldsegment of the San Andreas. Temblors of about magnitude 6 haverocked the segment almost every 22 years: Jan. 9, 1857; Feb. 2,1881; March 3, 1901; March 10, 1922; June 8, 1934; and June 28, 1966.   Lindh and Archuleta said a major quake probably would causeunreinforced brick buildings to collapse 30 miles away in PasoRobles, and nonstructural damage as far away as Bakersfield, SanLuis Obispo and perhaps Monterey.   A great quake like the one Jackson believes is possible wouldrupture the fault well into Southern California, and could kill14,000 people, hospitalize 55,000 and cause $17 billion damage,according to a 1980 federal report.   Archuleta's study concluded that in addition to the stress builtup on the Parkfield segment of the fault, much strain also hasaccumulated on the next 20-mile segment to the southeast, whichcould rupture with a magnitude 7.2.   Jackson's study suggests the stress might be enough to make thefault break in a great quake along 220 miles of its length.   ``There is historical precedent for Parkfield earthquakestriggering great earthquakes. It happened once before,'' Sieh said.That was a magnitude 8 jolt in 1857 that killed two people inSouthern California, then occupied by only about 4,000.   Sieh, Archuleta and Lindh all doubt enough stress has built upsoutheast of Bitterwater Valley for the next Parkfield quake to be agreat quake or trigger one. Jackson argued that the stress, whileless than that relieved in 1857, is enough to cause a great quakeand has caused huge shocks on other faults.   He also acknowledges it might not even rupture the entireParkfield segment. And because the 1934 quake came 10 years earlierthan would have been expected, he says it may be 10 to 15 yearsbefore the next one, and not 1993.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Dec. 8</NOTE></DOC>
