Yano said the city waited to announce the contamination becauseinvestigations still were under way, but he said a small number ofresidents directly affected by it were told earlier.   He said the substance found in the wells, trichloroethylene, maycause cancer in humans. Acceptable levels in drinking water wereestablished by Health and Welfare Ministry guidelines in 1984.   In March 1987, officials found two of seven local wells inKimitsu, 27 miles southeast of Tokyo, contaminated with thesubstance. The city then expanded its investigation to cover 43wells.   Between May 1987 and June 1988, 10 wells were found to have beenpolluted, with one registering 237 times the acceptable level of0.03 milligrams per liter, according to Yano.   Four of the 10 contaminated wells were not in use, but waterfrom one is believed to have mixed with a larger system used by25,000 residents, said an official with the Kimitsu WaterworksDepartment. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, saidall contaminated wells have been shut down.   The 25,000 residents, whose water would have been diluted byuncontaminated supplies, were not informed until Thursday.   Soon after the original findings, eight households using waterdirectly from the wells were told to boil their water beforedrinking it, Yano said.   He said the pollution is believed to have originated from anindustrial plant owned by the Toshiba Components Co., but aninvestigation has not been completed.   A plant official said that after being informed of thecontaminated wells, the plant offered to ``donate'' waterpurification equipment worth an estimated $225,000. Some equipmentnow is being tested.   ``Our decision to donate the equipment does not mean that we areaccepting responsibility,'' said Katsuo Inami, head of the ToshibaComponents plant's General Affairs Division. ``By donatingequipment we hope to speed up efforts to determine the source ofthe pollution.''   But Inami said as far as he knew the plant was the only one inthe area using trichloroethylene and ``may have been a pollutant inthe past.'' The company has operated since 1967 and used thechemical since 1972, he said.   Hisashi Yano, an official with the Water Quality Bureau of theEnvironment Agency, said although trichloroethylene ``has beenfound by some to be a possible carcinogen, we cannot say forcertain whether it actually causes long- or short-term harm.''   Trichloroethylene is used mainly as an industrial cleanser, butis also used by dry cleaners.</TEXT></DOC>
