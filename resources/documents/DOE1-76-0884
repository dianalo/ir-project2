ASPECT's unique detectoris a stationary annular single-crystal NaI(TI) scintillator used witha lightweight rotating collimator, which will provide 3-dimensional imagingof the brain with up to six-fold improvement in sensitivity over conventionalsingle-headed rotating gamma cameras. ASPECT is unique in other importantrespects in addition to the detector/collimator system. Signals fromeach photomultiplier (PM) are separately digitized on an event by eventbasis, with all position analysis algorithms performed digitally. Thisresults in significant differences from a conventional Anger camera,where the first determination of the position of a scintillation eventis calculated using analog circuitry. Other innovative software includesautomated procedures enabling quality control and total system calibrationto be easily undertaken by the user.</TEXT></DOC>
