Specification 4.11.2.7.2 requires the radioactivity rate ofnoble gases from the off-gas recombiner effluent to be determined at twospecified frequencies: (1) At least once per 31 days, and (2) within 4hours following an increase of 50% in the indicated nominal steady statefission gas release from the primary coolant (with certain provisions).The APPLICABILITY of this Specification (i.e., the applicable OPERATIONALCONDITION) is ``during operation for the main condenser air ejector''.Although it is readily apparent that Surveillance 4.11.2.7.2 cannot beperformed until after entering the special applicable OPERATIONAL CONDITION,an exception to Specification 4.0.4 has been proposed to be included inSpecification 4.11.2.7.2. in order to ensure compatibility between Specification4.0.4 and 4.11.2.7.2. This exception formally allows the plant to enterthe applicable OPERATIONAL CONDITION without having first performed therequired surveillances. <T3>Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action: </T3>The Commission hasdetermined that the licensees' proposed change to their RETS meets theintent of the NRC model RETS for BWRs, NUREG-0473, Revision 2, dated February1, 1980. Thus, the proposed change does not involve a significant increasein the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.Two plants which are similar to Clinton that were licensed in the pastseveral years have this proposed exception incorporated in their originalRETS. The Commission has determined that potential radiological releases duringnormal operations, transients, and for accidents would not be increased.With regard to non-radiological impacts, the proposed amendment involvessystems located entirely within the restricted area as defined in 10 CFRPart 20. They do not affect non-radiological plant effluents and have noother environmental impacts. Therefore, the staff also concludes that thereare no significant non-radiological environmental impacts associated withthe proposed amendment. Accordingly, the Commission findings in the ``Final Environmental Statementrelated to the operation of Clinton Power Station, Unit No. 1'' dated May1982, regarding radiological environmental impacts from the plant duringnormal operation or after accident conditions, are not adversely alteredby this action. IP is committed to operate Clinton Unit 1 in accordancewith standards and regulations to maintain occupational exposure levels``as low as reasonably achievable''. <T3>Alternative to the Proposed Actions: </T3>The principal alternativewould be to deny the requested amendment. This alternative, in effect,would be the same as a ``no action'' alternative. Since the Commissionhas concluded that no adverse environmental effects are associated withthis proposed action, any alternatives with equal or greater environmentalimpact need not be evaluated. <T3>Alternative Use of Resources: </T3>This action does not involve theuse of resources not previously considered in connection with the NuclearRegulatory Commission's Final Environmental Statement dated May 1982 relatedto this facility. <T3>Agencies and Persons Consulted: </T3>The NRC staff reviewed the licensees'request of October 30, 1987 and did not consult other agencies or persons.<ITAG tagnum="84">Finding of No Significant Impact: </ITAG>The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statementfor the proposed license amendment. Based upon this environmental assessment, the Commission concludes thatthe proposed action will not have a significant adverse effect on the qualityof the human environment.
