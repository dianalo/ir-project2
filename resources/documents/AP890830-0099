Officials said 11 people were killedand more than 100,000 arrested.   The nationwide strike shut down commerce and transportation insix states controlled by opposition parties but had less effect inthe 19 states governed by Gandhi's Congress Party, Press Trust ofIndia said.   Several clashes broke out between government supporters andopposition demonstrators and at least four people died when a bombwas thrown at a bus, police said. Police used batons and tear gas tobreak up crowds nationwide, news reports said.   At least 80 people were injured and 103,450 were arrestednationwide, police said.   Opposition parties had called the strikes to focus attention onalleged government corruption. Gandhi must call new parliamentaryelections later this year and the strike has been perceived as beingthe start of the opposition's campaign.   The strike closed shops, businesses and schools and stopped railand transport services in the six opposition-government states. Inother regions, it evoked only a limited response although there wasa drop in business activity and attendance at schools, colleges andoffices.   About 2,700 people, including 16 lawmakers, were arrested forsitting on railroad tracks to block trains in southern Tamil Nadustate, police said.   Press Trust said at least 11 people were killed in clashesinvolving police and pro- and anti-government factions. It saidseven deaths were reported from the northeastern state of Tripura,which borders Bangladesh, in fighting between members of theCongress Party and the Marxist Communist Party.   Four people were killed in the states of Kerala and West Bengal,both governed by the Marxist Communist Party, it said.   V.P. Singh, the leader of an opposition coalition trying to unitepolitical groups against Gandhi, said the strike was a success.   ``We are very confident of the future,'' he said at a newsconference.   Singh's National Front had called the strike and was supported bythe Marxist Communist Party, the Communist Party of India and theright-wing Indian People's Party.   Federal Home Minister Buta Singh claimed the strike failed andthat ``the forces that inspired it have been decisively defeated.''   He said that except in the opposition-ruled states, citizensrejected the strike call and federal government organizationsnationwide functioned normally.   In New Delhi, thousands of government employees slept in theiroffices Tuesday night so they could report to work on Wednesday. Thegovernment had threatened not to pay them the day's salary if theymissed work.   Food and bedrolls were provided for employees and seniorexecutives were given rooms in luxury hotels, said officials whospoke on condition of anonymity.   The strike brought to a climax the opposition's campaign againstalleged corruption in the government. Last month, 106 oppositionmembers in Parliament resigned, saying a government audit into acontroversial arms deal proved kickbacks were paid to seniorofficials and Gandhi's party.   Opposition leaders say a Swedish company, AB Bofors, paid $50million in kickbacks and bribes to secure a $1.4 billion contract tosupply artillery guns to the Indian army. The government denies thecharge.   Parliamentary elections must be called before January.   The strike was a rare show of unity for the normally fracturedopposition.   Gandhi's Congress Party won 415 out of the 544 parliamentaryseats in the last general elections in 1985. Political analysts sayany chance the opposition could have for winning the next electionlies in its ability to put up concensus candidates and avoidsplitting the anti-Congress vote.   The only time the Congress has lost an election in independentIndia was when the opposition united in 1977. But that governmentfell apart less than three years later when the fragile coalitionsplintered.</TEXT></DOC>
