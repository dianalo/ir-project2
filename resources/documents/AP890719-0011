U.S. District Judge Mariana Pfaelzer issued the prison sentenceafter learning she could not place Kevin Mitnick in ahospital-operated therapy program for what an expert witness calledMitnick's ``impulse disorder.''   The program is not under contract with the federal government,said Grace Denton, a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney.   ``A federal sentence has to be served in a federal facility,''she said.   Mitnick, who has been incarcerated at the federal MetropolitanDetention Center downtown for seven months, need only serve fivemore months in prison, Ms. Denton said.   Mitnick, 25, pleaded guilty in May to computer fraud andpossessing unauthorized long-distance telephone codes. He will spendsix months in a residential therapy program after serving his prisonterm.   The charges stemmed from his use of stolen MCI long-distancecodes to tap into computers and copy valuable programs from DigitalEquipment Corp.   After his prison term, Mitnick will be under conditional releasefor three years. Mitnick will not be able to possess any illegal orunauthorized access to computers or telecommunications equipment,and will not be allowed to associate with known hackers. Anothercondition states that he must complete a rehabilitation program.   During his six months in a halfway house, Mitnick will be allowedto either go to work or to treatment programs during the day, but hemust return to the halfway house at night, Ms. Denton said. He canstill have a personal computer.   At one time, federal authorities considered Mitnick dangerousenough to restrict his telephone use in jail. But Mitnick latercooperated with authorities and apologized in court for his actions,promising never to repeat them.   Harriet Rossetto, a licensed social worker, testified thatMitnick suffers from an impulse disorder and that his illegalcomputer activity boosted his self-esteem.   ``This is a new and growing addiction,'' she said. ``There was nogreed involved. There was no sabotage involved.''   Assistant U.S. Attorney James R. Asperger said that Mitnick'sactivities were ``something like climbing Mount Everest.''   ``He did it because it's there,'' said Asperger.</TEXT></DOC>
