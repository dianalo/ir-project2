The significantly higher rates of lung cancer found with the ratsexposed turned out to exceed the values expected in view of the relativelylow PAH content of diesel exhausts. Both the absence of tumours in therespiratory tract of hamsters and the vague diagnoses of the lungs ofmice have fanned a discussion about the actual relevance of the experimentalresults obtained for rats to exhaust-exposed humans.</TEXT></DOC>
