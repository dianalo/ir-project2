Supervisors nailed safety signs to the walls, held regularmeetings and investigated accidents, but &quot;we weren't gettinganywhere,&quot; says chief engineer Glen Reddish. So they scrappedthe plant's safety program and canceled safety supervision.</LP><TEXT>   Instead, they called in psychologists and statisticians toidentify the root causes of common injuries. And theyassembled a volunteer force of hourly workers to reward theirpeers' safe behavior.   Apparently the strategy worked. Injuries dropped by 76%between 1987 and 1990 -- without top-down supervision orpunishment. &quot;We've seen a cultural change on our site,&quot; saysPaul Villane, the plant's senior safety engineer.   Several companies are taking pages out of psychologytextbooks to improve workplace safety. Instead of reacting toinjuries with an iron fist, these manufacturers have moved toa peer-review system that shapes workers' behavior withimmediate, constant feedback and positive reinforcement.   At Du Pont Co., safety experts provide feedback whileengineers observe workers and then redesign valves andinstall key locks to deter accident-causing behavior. AtAluminum Co. of America, which introduced a &quot;brother'skeeper&quot; slogan in the workplace, all employees must submitsafety improvement suggestions, and even the lowest levelworkers can stop production lines if they suspect a safetyproblem.   Eastman Kodak Co.'s Longview, Texas, plant put in a&quot;teamwork behavioral process&quot; under which hourly employeesencourage their peers to work safely.   &quot;People's behavior changes when you provide positiveconsequences,&quot; says Thomas R. Krause, president of BehavioralScience Technology Inc., an Ojai, Calif., safety consultingfirm. &quot;The old way is to count the number of cut fingers. Nowwe count the number of people wearing gloves.&quot;   That's not to say the behavioral approach always works.Alcoa's lost time injury rate of 1.1 per hundred workers peryear is well below the industry's 2.8, but four workers werekilled at Alcoa plants in 1990. And while Du Pont's rate of.24 is half the chemical industry's .59 rate, three Du Pontworkers were killed on the job last year. Also, unions oftenchallenge the sincerity of the new safety programs, sincelabor groups are rarely invited to participate and theprograms aren't included in contracts.   But for companies, there's an obvious incentive to keeptrying -- and, of course, it's not simply altruistic. One DuPont estimate puts the company's annual cost savings fromimproved safety at $150 million. Alcoa, which has improvedits safety record by 25% in three years, estimates it saves$10,000 to $12,000 in workers' compensation for each accidentavoided.   At Monsanto's Pensacola plant in 1987, psychologists andengineers studied reports and interviewed workers aboutaccidents that occurred over a five-year period to discoverthe &quot;critical behaviors&quot; that caused them. If the causewasn't obvious (such as using the wrong tools or not wearingprotective equipment), the consultants drew a &quot;cause tree&quot; tofind the culprit. If a worker slipped on oil, for example,the root cause might not be oil on the floor but ashort-handed maintenance staff, which caused maintenance tobe deferred and in turn allowed a machine to leak, resultingin spilled oil.   After finding dozens of causes, the plant gave thevolunteer workers scorecards to search for safe and unsafeexamples of the &quot;critical behaviors.&quot; The workers check for&quot;short cuts and deviations&quot;; make sure workers keep &quot;eyes onhands,&quot; avoid &quot;pinch points&quot; and keep out of the &quot;line offire&quot;; and cite &quot;housekeeping details&quot; like &quot;clutter&quot; and&quot;smoking.&quot; They're also on the lookout for workers whoposition themselves improperly before lifting heavy objects.   Some 10% of the work force participates in two half-hourobservations each week. Statisticians can then calculate asafety percentage to find areas that need more work.   In addition to one-on-one feedback from peers, safeworkers win recognition at weekly safety meetings and inquarterly reviews. Safe-working divisions win a token freelunch or coffee mug, and managers consider safety records inpromoting workers.   Monsanto's safety record has improved to 1.6 lost-timeinjuries per hundred workers per year, down from 6.5 in 1986and well below the industry average of 3.4.   When injuries happen at Du Pont, the company reports themquickly to workers to provide a sense of immediacy, trying toshow the behavior that caused the accident without naming theoffender. The chemical giant also tries to foster peerpressure to work safely by giving units common goals.   Workers feel such pressure to behave safely that somedon't report minor injuries because they fear repercussions,one consultant claims. Even near misses reach managers' ears,and Du Pont's chief executive insists on hearing within a dayabout every lost work-day case -- 35 in 1990.   DuPont offers carrots, too. Its directors give regularsafety awards, and workers win $15 to $20 prizes if theirdivisions are accident-free for six to nine months.   Alcoa tries to shape behavior with constant reminders andexamples. Chairman Paul H. O'Neill, on his first day in thetop job four years ago, made time to meet Alcoa's safetydirector. And when an Alcoa vice president visited a plant inSuriname and discovered a truck that didn't beep when itbacked up, he told the manager to shut down the entire miningfacility until the truck's alarm was fixed.   Before Kodak's Longview petrochemical plant switched to abehavioral safety program, managers would chastise workerswho burned themselves because they weren't wearing longsleeves or broke limbs falling from ladders. Now, volunteerobservers take turns supervising their peers. They rewardcolleagues with a wooden nickel good for a free Coke whenthey wear long sleeves, work on insulated machines or set upladders safely.   &quot;It's better to recognize a guy for success than beat himup for failure,&quot; says Chuck Davis, executive vice presidentof C.A. Short International Inc., a consultant on safetyincentive programs based in Columbus, Ohio. &quot;It's amazing howlittle reward a guy needs so he doesn't stick his arm in amachine.&quot;   ---                    Accidents on the Job                                                                                                          Incidence rates for fatal or lost work-time injuries per100 employees                                                                                                                                          1985     1987      1989                                                                                                        Textile                            .46      .48       .69 Chemical                           .52      .62       .63 Communication                      .90      .72       .81 Machinery                         1.50     1.74      2.10 All industries                    1.96     1.86      1.97 Services                          2.89     2.03      2.46 Nonferrous metals                 1.80     1.92      2.00 Food                              3.29     3.18      3.17 Government                        5.73     4.43      4.00 Trucking                          6.09    17.56      8.03                                                                                                          Source: National Safety Council   ---   Disabling work injuries -- all industries                                                                                                        Overexertion                               28.2% Struck by or against object                25.9% Falls                                      16.4% Non-impact strains                          7.4% Caught in or between objects                6.0% Contact with radiation, caustics            3.5% Motor-vehicle accident                      3.0% Rub or abrasion                             2.6% Contact with extreme temperature            2.3% Other                                       4.7%</TEXT></DOC>
