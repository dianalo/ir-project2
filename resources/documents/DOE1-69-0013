The narrow resonance of the /sup 23/Na(p, {gamma})/sup 24/Mgreaction at 309 keV was used to scan the depth profiles of Na via the(p, {gamma}) nuclear reaction analysis (NRA). During a vacuum annealingup to 460/sup 0/C, narrowing of the Na profile in the region of maximumcorrelated radiation damage was first observed (attributed to segregation),followed by outdiffusion. The NRA technique allowed the determinationof the diffusion coefficient and the activation energy of Na in Al atlow temperatures; the results agree with previous high-temperature measurements.Diffusion was also studied under the influence of uncorrelated radiationdamage introduced by additional He/sup +/ and Al/sup +/ implantations.</TEXT></DOC>
