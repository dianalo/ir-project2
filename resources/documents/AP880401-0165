Michael Dukakis adopted a new populist standFriday in a drive to win blue collar support in Wisconsin's primarywhile the Democratic presidential candidates in a chorus called onAttorney General Edwin Meese III to resign.   The four Democrats kept up hectic schedules despite the Passoverand Easter observances this weekend, mindful of the 81 delegates atstake Tuesday in Wisconsin.   Dukakis and Jesse Jackson each held farm rallies. Jacksonattracted more than 2,500 farmers and their families to his eventon Bud and Faye Lee's farm near Amery, in northern Wisconsin.Jackson told the farmers they deserve fair prices for theirproducts ``and workers deserve fair wages and the rich must payfair taxes.'' He said people could afford to pay a little more formilk, bread and ice cream to make sure farmers got their due.   Sens. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee and Paul Simon of Illinoisjoined Dukakis and Jackson in demanding that Meese resign.   ``As a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, today we areasking Ed Meese to resign,'' Simon said at a breakfast speech inSuperior.   ``It's time in this nation to restore respect for government, toestablish rule of law,'' Gore said in the same town.   Dukakis blamed Meese's Justice Department for allowing the``merger mania'' he said has cost a half million jobs.   ``We've got an attorney general who couldn't tell the differencebetween antitrust and antifreeze, an antitrust division that hasn'tbeen heard from in years,'' Dukakis told a labor audience inRacine. ``The Japanese must be laughing at us all the way to thebank.''   The furor over Meese's troubles erupted again Friday whenindependent counsel James C. McKay announced there was no evidence``developed to date'' to warrant a criminal indictment against theattorney general in connection with an Iraq-Jordan pipeline plan orhis investment in telephone company stock. McKay said the probe wascontinuing.   Dukakis' speeches and a new television ad that started airingFriday demonstrated the governor's shift to a more emotionalapproach drawing on the economic populism theme developed by Rep.Richard Gephardt, who dropped out of the race Monday.   ``The human cost of seven years of Republican indifference isstaggering,'' Dukakis says in the ad as laid-off workers, homelesspeople, unemployment lines and ``factory closed'' signs roll by thescreen. ``Who in this administration could look right into the eyesof the laid-off factory worker or the homeless family and saythey've kept the promise of America? I say they've broken thatpromise.''   Gephardt said on syndicated television program ``One on One''that he didn't mind the heavy borrowing from his campaign.``Everybody has stolen it,'' he said. ``I willed it everybody whenI pulled out and I hope they will use it. It is the issue of thiscampaign.''   Gore, who has been outspoken in criticism of Jackson this week,said again that Jackson's race doesn't entitle him to kid-glovetreatment.   ``An end to bigotry does not mean some candidates are game forcriticism and some are immune,'' Gore said.   In Washington, House Democratic Leader Tom Foley said Jacksonwill be subjected to increased scrutiny now that he is afront-runner. ``I think he would welcome that,'' Foley said. ``Thequestion that remains for the Jackson campaign is whether he iselectable in the fall.''   Foley said decisions by himself and others to withhold anendorsement at this point should not be interpreted as astop-Jackson signal.   ``There is a little bit of a sense that if you are neutral, youare getting in the way of Jesse Jackson,'' he said. ``That'sunfair.''   Colorado, with caucuses on Monday night, was drawing somepolitcal attention this weekend, including on the dormantRepublican side.   Pat Robertson, who has all but conceded the nomination to GeorgeBush, scheduled three days of activities in Colorado includingtalks at four Easter Sunday services. He has said he is determinedto go to the GOP convention in August with a block of delegates toinfluence the party platform and Bush's choice of a running mate.   Jackson and Dukakis also planned some activities this weekend inColorado. But the Democrats were focused mainly on Wisconsin andthe two industrial-state primaries that follow later this month:New York and Pennsylvania.   Gore spokesman Mark Armour said the campaign has hadfund-raising surge that will allow Gore to conduct a $1million-plus campaign for New York's April 19 primary withouttaking out any new loans.</TEXT></DOC>
