Two of the 11 unions without contracts declared a strike at 6:01 a.m. EST yesterday. Most of the total 6,600 unionized employees appeared to be honoring the work stoppage, a railroad spokesman said. Passenger trains weren't running yesterday and authorities urged commuters to use car pools and drive to subway stops. The unions, which have been working without a contract since Jan. 1, 1985, are striking over pay and benefit issues.    Contracts have been signed with five unions representing 2,650 employees, the railroad spokesman said. A time hasn't been set for resumption of negotiations with the 11 unions. The Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, representing 413 employees, and the Police Benevolent Association, representing 195 employees, declared the strike.    The railroad is a major transportation artery to and from New York City. About 136,000 people ride the railroad daily during the week with the vast majority boarding between 6 a.m. and 10 a.m. </TEXT></DOC>
