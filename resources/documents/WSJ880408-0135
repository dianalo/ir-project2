If he rides his Wisconsin momentum to a decisive New York triumph April 19, &quot;it is basically bye-bye&quot; to the others, says House Democratic whip Coelho. A big win would give Dukakis about 900 delegates. Political strategists say he then should win 60% of the roughly 1,100 still to be selected and two-thirds of the 600-odd Gephardt, Simon and &quot;super&quot; delegates. With those, he would be easily within reach of the 2,082 needed.    But running-mate problems loom. Dukakis would be under pressure to name Jackson, a move most elected Democrats oppose. The hope for a Southerner hits snags: Nunn's prospects dipped when he attacked Jackson this week; Gore's mediocre showing since Super Tuesday makes him less attractive. Other possibilities, such as Florida Sen. Graham, lack stature.    A surprise Jackson win in New York -- a la Kennedy's upset of Carter in the 1980 primary -- would smash any hopes of a clear Dukakis march to the nomination.    BUDGET CHEATING is on the upswing as deficit pressures mount.    OMB chief Miller complains the House violated last year's budget summit pact, but his protests are largely ignored. Rep. Obey calls &quot;a public lie&quot; the optimistic fiscal 1989 deficit projections in the House and Senate budget resolutions, which rely on what many believe are overly optimistic White House expectations.    Rising interest rates and the cost of bailing out banks and thrifts in California and Texas will drive the deficit higher. But neither Congress nor the administration wants to trigger the Gramm-Rudman law's automatic spending cuts in the midst of this year's political campaign. One possible ploy: The White House may push some bank bailout costs onto the already over-target 1988 budget.    ABRAMS EARNS administration scorn for his handling of the Noriega situation.    Pentagon and CIA officials use terms like &quot;harebrained&quot; and &quot;idiotic&quot; to describe the assistant secretary of state's strategies to oust the Panamanian strong man. Under pressure from State, the CIA reluctantly drafts a presidential finding authorizing a covert propaganda campaign against Noriega. But the idea is widely criticized; Carlucci gets Bush to help water it down.    Pentagon officials are thought to have leaked a State suggestion that Noriega be kidnapped, as a way of killing the idea and embarrassing Abrams. Even White House aides have started carping about Abrams, saying he is overstepping his authority.    But Abrams defenders insist that his single goal is to get Noriega out and that he is only doing what Shultz wants.    JUSTICE DEPARTMENT turmoil may claim another casualty: the planned government-wide crackdown on insider trading and commodities fraud. Assistant Attorney General Weld, who resigned, was a prime mover; without such a highly placed backer, says one senior prosecutor, &quot;there's no way that regulators will sit down with us and pool information.&quot;    CONSERVATIVES PRESSURING Bush on the GOP platform sign up Sens. Gramm, Helms and Symms to help tilt deliberations to the right. Strategists for the lobbying group, led by conservative activist Donald Devine, expect resistance from Bush forces, especially on social issues. But they think Bush will buckle if they lean on him.    A BILLION-DOLLAR BATTLE pits congressional liberals against lawmakers from Houston and Florida. The Senate's budget would spend the money on the space shuttle and station at the expense of a variety of anti-poverty and community-development programs. The House's budget has those priorities the other way around.    DOGFIGHTS ERUPT over how to fix the troubled FAA. With a presidential panel set to offer major recommendations later this month, a bill to make the agency independent of the Transportation Department gains more than 30 co-sponsors. But Transportation Secretary Burnley says the FAA bureaucracy is too close to industry to be trusted to set safety rules.    TRADE-BILL QUANDARIES afflict both Congress and the administration.    After struggling to accommodate White House objections, congressional conferees face complaints from their own memberships about the emerging measure. Some Democrats already oppose the bill as too watered-down; that sentiment could grow if Rostenkowski and Bentsen agree in talks next week to remove the plant-closing notification provision targeted by Reagan.    But killing that section would raise problems for the White House as well. It would then have a harder time justifying a veto, yet it regards several other provisions as objectionable too, including those punishing Toshiba, strengthening agricultural subsidies, requiring retaliation in narrow cases and raising benefits for displaced workers.    In hopes of gathering political support, backers include special-interest provisions aiding filbert growers, grapefruit-juice makers and oil producers.    MINOR MEMOS: In a suit against an outfit named Duck Book Communications, the SEC gets a ruling from a federal judge named Quackenbush. . . . A new anti-Jesse bumper sticker sprouts in New York: &quot;Jackson-Arafat.&quot; . . . The Democratic leadership's whip calendar says the House next week will take up &quot;The Child Prevention, Adoption and Family Services Act.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
