The model takes into account twohorizontal in-situ stresses, the axial stress and stresses due to fluidflow in the borehole and inside the porous plate. The model containssolutions for both plane strain and plane stress conditions. The modelhas many applications in applied mechanics. In rock mechanics, it givesthe total stress field, including the effects of the fluid pressure insidethe rock. It may also be used to model the mechanical response of chemicalabsorption processes like clay swelling or thermal effects. Assumingno porosity or chemical effects inside the material, the model reducesto a set of equations for stress concentration around a drilled holein a plate. One particular application of the model is in wellbore stabilityproblems as applied to the petroleum and mining industry. Here, the knowledgeof the stress fields is of utmost importance for a safe and economicaloperation.</TEXT></DOC>
