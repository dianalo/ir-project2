<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-22-0272 </DOCNO><TEXT>A method of gasifying solid fuels such as wood, chipboard, sawdust, coal,briquettes, domestic refuse etc. and for the subsequent combustion ofthe gases obtained, in which a furnace is used as the gas producer, saidfurnace having a moveable firegrate, a fuel supply aperture at the chargingshaft of its combustion chamber, and further inlet apertures at leastfor the primary air required for the gasification process and havingconveying and/or proportioning devices for the air supply, and connectingto the combustion chamber of the furnace a gas consumer in the form ofa gas burner fitted with a connection for secondary air and which maybe positioned inside or outside the furnace. For a better utilisationof the said fuels, and thus to increase the thermal effect when theyare converted into a heating gas, according to the invention the flowsof fresh air that are conducted separately within the furnace are preheated,namely the primary air flow to the gasification process and also thesecondary air, the latter being conveyed to a gas combustion processwhich immediately follows the gasification process and which alreadycommences in the furnace. A furnace to apply the method with a gas burnerin the form of a nozzle-like flame tube connecting to the combustionchamber in the body of the furnace is characterised by cavities in themulti-layered wall of the combustion chamber for, respectively, the primaryand secondary air flow and each having its own air entry aperture.</TEXT></DOC>
