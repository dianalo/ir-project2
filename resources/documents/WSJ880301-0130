The secondary market provided a constructive backdrop to Eurodollar offerings, as seasoned Eurodollar paper posted gains of about 3/8 point in 10-year maturities. The Euromarket in turn mirrored the moderate rise in U.S. Treasury prices on declines in commodity prices.    Despite the gains in bonds, several dealers said Eurodollar bond prices may be reaching temporary resistance levels that can't be breached until the market sees another bullish development. Analysts said such news could come later in the week, when several major U.S. economic indicators are scheduled to be released, including January new home sales and unemployment.    In the West German mark sector, Coca-Cola Co. had a strong, positive response to its 250 million mark ($148.1 million) issue, primarily because of its strong name and the current rarity of U.S. issues in the European markets.    The 10-year, 5 3/4% bonds were launched at 100 1/2 through Swiss Bank Corp. (Germany) AG. &quot;The market was friendly today and that surely helped, but it's the Coke name that's selling this bond and it again proves that conditions can be of secondary importance for many investors here,&quot; said one syndication manager.    IBM Credit's $250 million of 7 3/4%, three-year bonds, led by Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd., was one of three new dollar straight-debt issues. Credit National, the French quasi-government lender to industry, issued $200 million of 8 1/4%, five-year bonds through Nomura International Ltd., and Volvo AB appeared with $110 million of 7 3/4%, two-year bonds through Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.    Introduced at a spread of about 33 basis points above U.S. Treasury yields, the issue for the International Business Machines Corp. unit issue was considered somewhat generously priced by other syndication specialists. A Credit Suisse official said the company wanted a successful issue but disagreed that the pricing could be considered &quot;generous.&quot;    Meanwhile, dealers said Credit National's pricing at 53 basis points above Treasury securities was reasonable. They said there is good interest currently in French agency paper, reflected by the demand for the Credit National issue.    In contrast, Volvo's introductory spread of 50 basis points over Treasury securities was viewed by some dealers as fairly tight for a borrower of Volvo's standing. A Merrill Lynch official said, however, that the issue had found good demand and that Merrill Lynch had quickly assembled its syndication group. However, he conceded that a larger issue along the same lines might have been more difficult to place.    The Coke issue aroused most of the West German market's interest. Traders in particular saw the pricing tight initially and many said they were surprised by the high level of demand.    Many participants noted that the Coca-Cola issue marks a low this year in the yield at introduction for 10-year paper. At their 100 1/2 issue price, the Coke bonds yielded 5.68%.    A scarcity of U.S. names in most continental European markets seems to have helped. As one head of syndication in Zurich said, investors needing to diversify have been faced with a range of European sovereigns and corporations, but no U.S. names.    Rarity value has been increased by the fact that few U.S. companies are expected to increase their non-dollar liabilities in the near future. </TEXT></DOC>
