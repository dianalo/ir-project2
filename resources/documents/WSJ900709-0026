Urban homesteading, housing vouchers, an expandedearned-income tax credit and magnet schools all cost money.Yet with his unrelenting call for a capital-gains tax cut,Secretary Kemp would ask for even less support for hisprogram than those with the greatest ability to pay currentlyprovide.</LP><TEXT>   In real dollars, the median U.S. family income has beenstagnant for more than a decade. The poorest fifth have lost14% of their buying power since 1978. Meanwhile, the averagereal-dollar, after-tax incomes of those in the top 1% havemore than doubled. Would that Secretary Kemp's 1990s advocacyfor the poor also includes a plan to end the debt binge andthe upward wealth transfer that Rep. Jack Kemp loosed uponthe country in the 1980s.   Bruce L. Fisher   Research Director   Citizens for Tax Justice   Washington   ---   Mr. Kemp's thoughtful, evocative article should be mustreading for all members of Congress and their staffs. Itmakes such good sense; it might cause some to stop and think.Implementation of his suggestions for a national agendacould, over time, so truly and dramatically improve the lotof countless millions that even those most responsible forleading the nation into this sorrowful dilemma will stand andcheer.   Hugh B. Lee Jr.   Terre Haute, Ind.   ---   The highlighted text from Mr. Kemp's article referred to amother and two children. Among other topics, Mario Cuomo'ssolutions, apparently, included redistribution of wealth.   How about a better form of redistribution? How about aredistribution of the children? Fathers typically make morethan mothers, so why not routinely grant the custody of theirown children to them? We live in a society of strange values,in my opinion, when we automatically grant custody to theparent earning less income (or none at all), and then bleatthat our nation's children are living in poverty.
