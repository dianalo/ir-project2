Answering That Question Isn't Easy   After You've Been Fired   ----   By Gilbert Fuchsberg</HL><DATE>04/17/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE R1</SO><LP>   ARE YOU WORTH what you are paid? It may take losing yourjob to find out.   Dianne Douglas Graham, for one, figures she is worth atleast $125,000 a year. It isn't that she won't take less. Shecan't take less. Since losing that salary when Saatchi andamp;Saatchi Advertising in New York laid her off 18 months ago,the prize-winning creative director says agencies andrecruiters have told her that they couldn't afford that much-- yet wouldn't consider paying less. Their explanation? Shewould be unhappy and jump ship once the market improves.</LP><TEXT>   The result: Dozens of potential jobs have gone down thetube.   &quot;I'm in a pigeonhole that I just don't understand,&quot; saysMs. Graham, 36. &quot;It's really come to the point where the onlything I could do would be to literally reinvent myself --send out a resume with a different name, no awards, awatered-down version of my experience, and see if I could geta job as a nobody.&quot;   As growing numbers of white-collar workers arediscovering, pricing yourself on the job market is nevertougher than when you've been laid off. Aim too high andprospects shrink. Drop your price -- if an employer willallow it -- and you risk plunging down the salary ladder,negating years of progress. Just staying even can prove astruggle, too, as companies slash jobs, redefine positionsand shift salaries at a rapid pace.   That is all besides the basic disadvantage many layoffvictims face. Put simply: &quot;People who are employed make astronger pool of desirable candidates than those who arenot,&quot; says Dwight E. Foster, executive managing director ofFoster Partners, a New York recruiting firm.   In good times, most managers and executives who are shownthe door often improve their base pay when landing new jobs.And that can even happen now for people with certain highlysought skills or special experience. For instance, Mr. Fostersays he recently recruited to a $190,000 position with anindustrial-coatings maker a senior executive who had lost a$135,000 slot when his previous employer filed forbankruptcy-law protection.   But most newly unemployed professionals can't count onmoving up these days. It's not just that fewer managementjobs with big companies are available, but also that thenumber of people seeking them is so high. &quot;If you come out of25 years with IBM and you've been making $100,000 and you're50 years old, you're just not going to be marketable to otherFortune 500 companies,&quot; says John A. Connor, a senior vicepresident with FoxMorris Associates Inc., a Philadelphiaoutplacement and search firm.   Among managers filing through Lee Hecht Harrison, one ofthe largest outplacement concerns, just 40% boost theirsalaries when they find a job, down from 75% three years ago.Of the rest, 40% hold even, while 20% accept lower salaries.   For some, there's little shock -- or shame -- in alower-paying job. Ernest Whitney, senior vice president ofRight Associates, a large outplacement firm, cites the manypeople &quot;paid rather substantial sums at rather young ages&quot;who lost jobs on Wall Street in recent years. &quot;You don't haveto strong-arm them into being realistic about themarketplace,&quot; he says. &quot;You just hope that they have thepayments on the Porsche paid up.&quot;   But most view dropping down the pay ranks as tough tofathom, both financially and emotionally. Caren Ewing, 34,laid off in January from a $41,000 senior account executiveslot with the Washington, D.C., office of Porter Novelli, apublic-relations firm, has set $35,000 as a salary floor.Positions paying less, she worries, would offer fewchallenges -- and dramtically imperil her life style. Sheinsists she's not asking for much, just to live alone &quot;in asafe, comfortable neighborhood&quot; -- not &quot;in the lap of luxury,just happily.&quot;   &quot;I think you can only sacrifice so much of yourself,&quot; Ms.Ewing says.   Similar concerns affect better-paid layoff victims. A49-year-old senior planner, who last year lost his $140,000position with a big consumer-products company, allows that he&quot;could live on $90,000.&quot; But he is &quot;still looking for what Iwas making.&quot; As long as he can afford it, he says, he clingsto the hope that he won't have to suffer a drop. &quot;I might aswell be happy and unemployed than unhappy and employed,&quot; hesays.   Indeed, most companies want to make people feel good aboutcoming on board, not plant seeds of disgruntlement that couldlead to a hasty departure once the labor market improves. Forthat reason, if they hire applicants at all, they typicallyhire them at least at the level they were making, even ifthey are willing to take less.   &quot;Somebody may initially be excited that they have a job,but after the excitement, that individual is not going to behappy&quot; if they have taken a pay cut, says Steve Mendelsohn, aprincipal with benefits consultants William M. Mercer Inc.&quot;You don't want somebody to feel they are a bargain-basementfind.&quot;   Still, some might suffer such indignities for the sake ofa job. &quot;It just seems to me that companies are hurtingthemselves,&quot; says Ms. Graham, the former advertisingexecutive. &quot;There's an incredible amount of talent out therethat's not getting used because of this attitude that peopleare only what they were.&quot;   Ms. Graham terms as laughable the rationale that peopleshouldn't be hired at a discount because they will leave ifthe economy picks up. &quot;The whole paranoia about thesesuperior people bolting is ironic,&quot; she says. Advertising &quot;isa business where in good times people only stay a year or twoanyway.&quot;   Of course, unemployed professionals needn't always behostage to their former pay levels. Not all employers arereluctant to make lowball offers, especially in tough times.And many job seekers find that it is easier to land a new jobif they repackage themselves and change what they do or wherethey do it -- go from big company to small, say, or move fromNew York to Cleveland.   But only careful planning and negotiating can control aslide in compensation, career experts say. Here is whatseveral advise as a logical pricing strategy for out-of-workexecutives:                                                                                                          BE REALISTIC: To avoid pricing yourself out of the market,research how much other people with your experience make inyour occupation. Make sure to account for differences byindustry, location and size of company. Sources for suchinformation include search firms and trade associations.&quot;Don't make any assumptions,&quot; says Thomas E. O'Reilly, asenior consultant with Lee Hecht Harrison. &quot;If the market'stelling you you are being significantly overpaid, you've gotto listen to the marketplace.&quot;                                                                                                          SET A DROP-DEAD DATE: Determine how long your severance,outplacement and savings will allow you to stay out. Thefurther away that date, the longer you have to seek yourhighest salary target. Some experts still cite this rule ofthumb: Expect your hunt to last one month for every $10,000in pay you seek.                                                                                                          AVOID MONEY TALK: Before or during a first interview,employers may ask for your salary history. If you are overlyprecise, you could get screened out before getting to showyour charms. So postpone salary specifics as long aspossible. If pressed, talk in terms of a range, with aminimum that you could happily accept. &quot;To the degree you cando that and get further along in the process, the better,&quot;says Mr. Whitney of Right Associates. &quot;Then people willevaluate you on the basis of perceived value, rather than ona superficial number.&quot;                                                                                                          THINK BROADLY: If you are offered a job you like, but notthe salary, don't lose hope. Try bidding up the base payfirst. But remember: Your leverage may be minimal and manycompanies, considering internal equity issues, refuse tobudge much on straight pay. But they might be more flexibleon such things as signing bonuses, stock options, acceleratedreview schedules, company perks, insurance and vacation time.You might even seek an employment agreement -- to insure acushion of time and money if the worst happens again.   Employers are more likely to bend if they perceivebusiness reasons to expand your pay package, such asstrengths you would bring to the plate and how you might addto your duties. &quot;Companies are not going to be too moved bythe fact that you need more money because that's what youused to make, or because you've got 12 kids in college,&quot; saysMr. Whitney.   Raising your offer, of course, demands a determinationthat can be hard to muster after you have been laid off andspent months applying for jobs. But Mr. Whitney saysconfidence is as critical to success in the salary game as aresume. &quot;You can always negotiate down,&quot; he says. &quot;But it'sawfully difficult to negotiate up if your conviction isn'tstrong.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
