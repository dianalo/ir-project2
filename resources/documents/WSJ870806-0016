A bearish inventory report released after the market closed Tuesday sparked strong selling in the energy markets, traders said. The American Petroleum Institute reported sharp increases in U.S. supplies of crude oil, petroleum distillates and gasoline, as well as higher imports for the week ended July 31.    The statistics, coupled with recent reports of above-quota output by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, led many traders to liquidate their long, or buying, positions, brokers said.    &quot;The weight of supply is finally overwhelming the speculative longs in both oil and gold,&quot; said Dinsa Mehta, chief bullion trader at Chase Manhattan Bank in New York.    Both the oil and gold markets were buoyed earlier in the week by, among other things, intensifying Middle East tensions, which raised the specter of disruption in the flow of oil from the region and accelerating inflation.    On Monday, for instance, Iran vowed to seize Saudi Arabia's oil wealth and threatened to attack ships in the Persian Gulf after a weekend riot in Mecca. But no new rounds of violence or rhetoric were reported in the region yesterday.    Oil and gold prices &quot;had built in too large a 'fear' premium that is now being eroded,&quot; Mr. Mehta said.    &quot;That which tension moves, lack of tension moves back,&quot; said Seth Diamond, futures trading adviser at Advest Inc. in New York. &quot;Unfulfilled expectations lead to liquidation.&quot;    Crude for September delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange slipped 68 cents a barrel to $21.29. Heating oil and gasoline futures prices fell as well.    On the spot, or noncontract, market, the price of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, dropped 65 cents a barrel to $21.30. The spot price of North Sea Brent, an abundantly traded European crude, fell 75 cents a barrel to $19.80 in late trading.    The decline in precious metal prices was just as severe. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, August gold slumped $10.80 an ounce to $466.80, and September silver plunged 49.5 cents an ounce to $8.38.    October platinum on the New York Merc plummeted $20.90 an ounce to $627.80. The recent burst of volatility led the Merc to raise the minimum margin, or good-faith deposit, for customers trading platinum to $2,000 a contract, from $1,800, starting today.    Fundamental factors in both markets suggest further declines in prices, some analysts said.    &quot;In the absence of any excitement in the gulf, oil prices will be on the defensive,&quot; said Peter Beutel, assistant director of the energy group at Elders Futures Inc. in New York.    Meanwhile, Chase's Mr. Mehta said, selling by gold producers in Australia, the Soviet Union, Canada and the U.S. has helped push down prices of the metal.    The producer selling, he said, is &quot;good quality,&quot; or fundamental as opposed to speculative, and gold prices are &quot;technically vulnerable&quot; at current levels.    In other commodity markets yesterday:    INTEREST RATES: Bond futures prices rallied on the weakness in the oil and precious metals futures markets. The fears of accelerating inflation that were spurred by Persian Gulf tensions and that sent bond futures skidding Monday seemed to have abated, at least temporarily, traders said. Treasury bond futures for September delivery rose 1 1/32 to 89 7/32 in brisk trading. Stock-index futures prices took their cue from bond futures and also rebounded, traders said. The rally may not be long-lived, though, said Charles Christensen, a bond futures analyst at Refco Group Ltd. in Chicago. Treasury bond futures have to close above 89 10/32 to lure another wave of buyers, he said.    SUGAR: Futures prices fell after showing early strength amid indications that adverse weather may have hurt European sugar beets, at least temporarily. October sugar settled at 5.95 cents a pound, down 0.04 cent, after being up 0.1 cent at 6.09 cents. The first test of the U.K.'s beet crop showed smaller sizes and less sugar content than a year ago, because of recent rains, analysts said. European beets are still in their growing season. Average root weight was 263 grams, compared with 299 grams for the first test last year. Sugar content was about 11.7% of each beet, or 31 grams, down from 12.4%, or 37 grams, last year. However, a report from Sweden last week indicated above-average yields, analysts said. And last year's crop also started poorly but yielded a bumper harvest, they said. &quot;The harvest isn't until September, and a change to dry and sunny weather can turn everything completely around,&quot; an analyst said. Also helping to firm prices early on was the Common Market's weekly offer to sell processed beet sugar. The offer of 80,000 metric tons was less than 100,000 tons for the second week in a row. A metric ton is equal to 1.1 U.S. short tons, or 2,204.6 pounds.    GRAINS andamp; SOYBEANS: Corn and soybean futures prices rose slightly, while wheat prices were mixed. The sluggish activity reflected growing caution among traders, many of whom are waiting to see whether cooler temperatures and normal rainfall will persist, boosting harvests and depressing prices. And some traders are staying out of the market until they form a clearer picture about what they expect from the Agriculture Department crop output report to be released Tuesday. Market activity will remain subdued until the report comes out, said Daniel Markey, owner of Agri Analysis in Chicago. &quot;Right now, there is a great deal of uncertainty&quot; about the size of the various crops, he said. </TEXT></DOC>
