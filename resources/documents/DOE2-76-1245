This paper conducted theoretical analysis of tidal current ellipsescaused by the earth's autorotation while considering the influence ofthe land-sea borders. This study has revealed the following: (1) In relativelynarrow inland seas, no tidal current ellipse occurs in the external regionof the bottom layer boundary layer, but the same ellipse is formed inthe boundary layer while being independent from the bay width; (2) Inwider inland seas, a tidal current ellipse occurs even outside of theboundary layer, but (a) the ellipticity further increases within theboundary layer; (b) the main axis of the tidal current ellipse deviatesclockwise inside the boundary layer; and (c) these tidal current ellipserotate counterclockwise on the northern hemisphere.
