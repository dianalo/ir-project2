This regulation requires the Commonwealth of MassachusettsDepartment of Environmental Quality Engineering (DEQE) to determine andimpose RACT on all stationary sources with the potential to emit one hundredtons per year (TPY) or more of VOCs that are not already subject to RACTunder Massachusetts' regulations developed pursuant to the EPA ControlTechniques Guideline (CTG) documents. In a November 17, 1982 letter toEPA, the DEQE committed to submit each of the individual RACT determinationsto EPA for incorporation into the Massachusetts SIP. On November 9, 1983,EPA codified at 40 CFR 52.1123 that the DEQE must submit each RACT determinationmade under 310 CMR 7.18(17) to EPA as a SIP revision in order to incorporatethe limitations into the SIP. EPA's rationale for requiring the DEQE tosubmit each RACT determination as a single source SIP revision is thatemission limits and reduction measures imposed by states on existing stationarysources in nonattainment areas do not constitute RACT unless and untilEPA approves them as RACT via rulemaking.Boston Whaler, Inc. in Norwell, Massachusetts is a non-CTG VOC source subjectto RACT under Massachusetts' Regulation 310 CMR 7.18(17). On March 25 andJune 30, 1987, EPA received a proposed SIP revision from the MassachusettsDEQE. This revision includes the DEQE's proposed Plan Approval, State OrderSM-85-117-1F, issued under 310 CMR 7.18(17) to Boston Whaler, Inc. in Norwell,Massachusetts on July 8, 1986. This proposed Plan Approval imposes RACTfor Boston Whaler's non-CTG processes and specifies a December 31, 1986compliance date. Although the proposed Plan Approval issued by the DEQEis currently fully enforceable by that agency under State law, the formalSIP revision submitted by the DEQE to EPA must consist of the Plan Approvalamended as specified by this notice before EPA will undertake final rulemakingapproving it as RACT and incorporating it into the SIP.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of RACT Determination</ITAG>Boston Whaler has three production processes that emit VOCs at its Norwellfacility. The three production processes are fiberglass boat fabrication,clean-up operations and miscellaneous operations. As stated above, on March25 and June 30, 1987, the DEQE submitted State Order SM-85-117-IF as aproposed Plan Approval for Boston Whaler's Norwell facility. That proposedPlan Approval imposes requirements on Boston Whaler which the DEQE hasdetermined to constitute RACT to reduce VOC emissions. The requirementsof the proposed Plan Approval are summarized below:Fiberglass Boat Fabricationa. A reduced-styrene content gelcoat resin must continue to be used.b. New gelcoat application equipment is required which reduces the amountof resin required per unit of production.c. Improved gelcoat and laminating resin management and engineering changesto reduce usage and emissions are required.Clean-up Operationsa. Closed-top dip tanks are required.b. Employees contacting laminating resin are required to wear gloves.c. Employee training to reduce cleaning solvent usage is required.d. Boston Whaler, Inc. must control and track the use of organic cleaningsolvent.e. Work practice modifications are required including the substitutionof a water-based cleaning solution for an organic cleaning solvent forsome applications.Miscellaneous OperationsThe methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) content in the Gelcoat Catalyst must be reducedthrough the installation of new application equipment.As a result of these VOC emission reduction measures imposed in the proposedPlan Approval, Boston Whaler, Inc.'s Norwell facility will achieve a plantwideemission reduction of approximately 51%, when 1983 baseline emission levelsare compared with emission levels after control. The year 1983 was usedas the baseline year instead of the 1980 baseline year of the SIP as aresult of several factors which complicated or invalidated comparisonsbetween present and future emissions. For example, the production of smallsailboats from 1979 to 1982 significantly changed the potential productionand emissions per boat during that time. Additionally, recordkeeping hasimproved greatly for the period since 1983.In addition to the above individual VOC emission reduction measures whichconstitute RACT, the proposed Plan Approval also requires Boston Whalerto meet the emission rates expressed in pounds of VOC emitted per boatproduced. These emission rates are imposed as additional requirements onBoston Whaler to assure that the VOC emission reductions resulting fromthe continuous compliance with the RACT measures as stated above are permanent.The final compliance date contained in the proposed Plan Approval is December31, 1986. These emission rates are specified in the proposed Plan Approvalfor each of Boston Whaler's three production processes as follows:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,s10,12</C> <H1>  </H1><H1>Pounds VOC/per boat produced, effective Dec. 31, 1986</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Fiberglass boat fabrication <D>63.5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Clean-up operations <D>52.0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Miscellaneous operations <D>2.4</D><R/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">Total pounds VOC emitted/boat </ITAG><D>\1\ 117.9</D><F>\1\ This represents a 51% reduction over 1983 emission levels, on aper boat produced basis.</F></ITAG>Whether Boston Whaler is complying with the above emission limitationswill be determined in accordance with records of VOC usage which it isrequired to maintain. In order to assure that Boston Whaler is adheringto the improved gelcoat and laminating resin management policy in its dailyoperations, it is required to update the following recordkeeping forms:Gelcoat Daily Reconcilement; Laminating Resin Daily Reconcilment; DailyVOC Chemical Usage; Laminating Resin Daily Reconcilement, Norwell SmallParts; and Gelcoat Daily Reconcilement, Norwell Small Parts. In addition,Boston Whaler is required to control and track the use of organic cleaningsolvent by updating the recordkeeping form, ``Norwell Daily Cleaning SolventUsage.'' This will provide Boston Whaler the information necessary to determinethe amount of cleaning solvent which can be allocated to various departmentsand still meet Boston Whaler's usage reduction goals.EPA has reviewed the proposed Plan Approval and supporting documents submittedas a SIP revision for parallel-processing and generally concurs with theDEQE's RACT determination. For more details on EPA's review and justificationof Boston Whaler's RACT determination, see the Technical Support Documentavailable at the EPA Regional Office listed in the <T2>ADDRESSES </T2>section of this notice. However, the proposed Plan Approvalitself must be amended as explained below before EPA will conduct finalrulemaking to approve and incorporate it into the SIP.The proposed Plan Approval specifies certain work practice standards andprocess modifications as emission reduction measures for fiberglass boatfabrication, clean-up operations, and miscellaneous operations which theDEQE has determined to constitute RACT for Boston Whaler. These RACT requirements,as currently written in the proposed Plan Approval, in general are notclearly enforceable and the emission reductions calculated to result fromtheir implementation, therefore, may not occur.EPA is proposing to approve the Commonwealth of Massachusetts' proposedPlan Approval (ORDER SM-85-117-IF) as RACT for Boston Whaler's Norwellfacility. However, before EPA will conduct final rulemaking approving thisPlan Approval as a SIP revision, the DEQE must add the requirements listedbelow to clarify the RACT emission reduction measures and to make themmore enforceable. The Plan Approval must also specify the final compliancedate of December 31, 1986 for the following requirements. Regulation 310CMR 7.18(17) requires subject stationary sources to demonstrate compliancewith RACT as expeditiously as practicable but no later than December 31,1986.Fiberglass Boat Fabrication1. The final Plan Approval must specify a maximum styrene monomer contentnot to be exceeded for the reduced-styrene content gelcoat and polyesterlaminating resins and require Boston Whaler to use only these types ofresins.2. The final Plan Approval must specify the type of gelcoat applicationequipment (e.g., airless, air-assisted airless, or electrostatic sprayequipment) that has been demonstrated to use less resin by providing amore even and less porous coating, thereby reducing the VOCs emitted perunit of production. This measure could be made enforceable by requiringBoston Whaler to use only this specific type of gelcoat application equipment.Clean-up Operations 1. The final Plan Approval must specify that all cleaning solvent dip tanks'and containers' lids are closed at all times except when an item is beingentered into or removed. 2. The final Plan Approval must require Boston Whaler to operate its in-housesolvent recovery system which is used to reclaim waste organic cleaningsolvent, and must include specific operating requirements for the solventrecovery system. First, the final Plan Approval must specify a maximumweight percentage of VOC content to be met at all times (on a continuousbasis) for the solvent recovery system's residues. This maximum VOC contentby weight should be initially established using the solvent recovery system'sdesign specifications and the reduction in VOC emissions accounted forduring RACT implementation. In addition, the final Plan Approval must alsospecify, at a minimum, one of the following limitations for the solventrecovery system in accordance with its design specifications: (1) A maximumconcentration of outlet VOCs from the condensor's vent (i.e., in partsper million by volume of VOC) not to be exceeded, (2) a maximum temperatureof the condensor's vent not to be exceeded, or (3) a maximum temperatureof the condensor's coolant not to be exceeded. This will assure that thesolvent recovery system is operating as intended and designed. Finally,the Plan Approval must require that the waste organic cleaning solvent(before being recovered) and the solvent recovery system's residues (beforebeing sent out as a waste product) must be stored in closed containersto prevent evaporation. 3. The final Plan Approval must specify what portion of the solvent cleaningof brushes, rollers, spray guns, hands, etc. is done with the newly introducednon-volatile, water-based cleaning solvent. The final Plan Approval mustrequire Boston Whaler to use only this water-based cleaning solvent indesignated areas where reduction in VOC emissions from its use were accountedfor during RACT implementation. In addition, the final Plan Approval mustspecify for each cleaning solvent: the name, an emission rate in poundsof VOC per gallon of cleaning solvent, designated area(s) for its application,and a daily maximum consumption in gallons of VOC per day. Miscellaneous Operations The final Plan Approval must specify a maximum feed ratio of gelcoat catalystto fiberglass resin in accordance with reduction in VOC emissions thatwere anticipated due to the installation of new application equipment underthe RACT determination. Likewise, for the finishing of small parts (gastank covers, cabin topskins, consoles, lockers, etc.) and hulls, the finalPlan Approval must specify a maximum content to be met on a continuousbasis of naphtha/mineral spirits and other VOC(s) in the polyester resincatalyst in either volume or weight percent. Finishing includes repairingany defects on the molded hull as well as plugging and patching any holescaused by the molding tools. Once EPA approves the final Plan Approval for Boston Whaler, the DEQE mustsubmit any amendment to it as a SIP revision. Today's Action In order for EPA to take final action approving the DEQE's Plan Approvalfor Boston Whaler, that Plan Approval must be amended to include the requirementsoutlined in this notice. If the DEQE's final Plan Approval does not incorporate the requirementsoutlined in this notice to clearly define Boston Whaler's RACT VOC emissionreduction measures and insure their enforceability, EPA will withdraw thisproposed action to approve it and publish an action proposing to disapproveBoston Whaler's Plan Approval. EPA is soliciting public comments on issues discussed in this notice. Thesecomments will be considered before taking final action. Interested partiesmay participate in the Federal rulemaking procedure by submitting writtencomments to the address above. This revision is being proposed under a procedure called ``parallel processing''(47 FR 27073). If the proposed revision is substantially changed, in areasother than those required in this notice, EPA will evaluate those changesand may publish a revised NPR. If no substantial changes are made otherthan those areas cited in this notice, EPA will publish a Final RulemakingNotice on the revision. Final rulemaking action by EPA will occur onlyafter the final Plan Approval for Boston Whaler has been issued by theDEQE and has been formally submitted to EPA for incorporation into theSIP.<ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Action </ITAG>EPA is proposing to approve Commonwealth of Massachusetts' ORDER SM-85-117-IF,a proposed Plan Approval, as a revision to the Massachusetts SIP with theunderstanding that the DEQE will revise the proposed Plan Approval as outlinedin this notice prior to its formal submitted to EPA for incorporation intothe SIP.Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I certify that this SIP revision will not have asignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.(See 46 FR 8709.)The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof section 3 of Executive Order 12291.
