ALARON is currently licensed to use a drum compactorat its warehouse, to package waste resulting from currently licensed decontaminationactivities and to prepare for shipment to a licensed radioactive wastedisposal site. On February 27, 1987, ALARON applied for an amendment tothis license, to perform low-level radioactive waste (LLWS) brokerage operations:to receive, to open, to temporarily store and to compact LLW packaged indrums or other Department of Transportation (DOT)-approved containers fromvarious licensed users of radioactive byproduct material.The amendment would consist of changes to the license and would authorizethe facility to receive DAW as a mixture of compactible trash (i.e., plastics,paper, cardboard, etc.) primarily from the nuclear power plant industry.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Need for the Proposed Action</ITAG>In recent years, there has been much uncertainty about the availabilityof the three existing LLW disposal sites, as States proceed with plansto develop regional LLW disposal sites in accordance with the Low-LevelRadioactive Waste Policy Act of 1980 (Public Law 96-573; 42 U.S.C. 2021b,<T3>et seq.</T3>). This uncertainty has sensitized generators of radioactivewastes to the need to minimize the amount of LLW held awaiting disposal.ALARON has realized an increased demand for a LLW brokerage service. Thus,ALARON has requested the capability to accept and repackage LLW from otherlicensees that generated radioactive waste. This would allow ALARON todecrease the overall LLW volume of radioactive materials requiring burialin disposal sites.<ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action</ITAG>The Environmental Assessment concluded that the environmental impacts ofoperating the ALARON waste brokerage facility for acceptance and compactionof DAW are expected to be negligible. Operation of the waste reduction,decontamination and compactions activities are consistent with local land-usepatterns. ALARON is already located within an existing industrial developmentcomplex, and there are no anticipated construction activities that woulddisrupt the flow of traffic.The environmental impacts from potential radiological releases from compactoroperations were assessed for a mix of 75 percent reactor wastes and 25percent industrial/institutional wastes. Calculation of offsite radiologicaldoses and air concentrations are based on extended compactor operationsof 20 hours a day, 5 days per week, for 50 weeks per year. Process effluentswere assessed based on: 0.01 percent of a drum's activity released to thestack exhaust system; 99.9 percent particulate removal efficiency (decontaminationfactor (DF)=1000) for the high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filterin the exhaust system; and no removal of tritium or carbon-14 by the exhaustfilter system. Atmospheric dispersion evaluations were based on meterologicaldata in the ``Final Safety Analysis Report, Beaver Valley Power StationUnit-2, Shippingport Borough, Pennsylvania (Docket No. 050-00412)'' (approximately20 miles southwest of ALARON).For all nuclides, the plant-site boundary nuclide concentrations resultingfrom normal operations were calculated to be far below the maximum permissibleconcentrations (MPCs) listed in appendix B, 10 CFR part 20. The estimatedwhole body dose for the maximally exposed individual (due to compactoroperations) for all pathways was calculated to be less than 2E-06 mremper year. This does is a small fraction of the dose limit (500 mrem/yr)for unrestricted areas specified in 10 CFR 20.105(a) of the Commission'sregulations, and is also a small fraction of the limits for release specifiedby the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in its regulation, 10 CFRpart 61, subpart I (25 mrem/yr for whole body and 75 mrem/yr for body organs).Radiation doses to workers were assessed. In operating the compactor, aconservative estimate for the increase in personnel exposure (assumingcurrent staffing) is an additional 10 mrem per month. The estimated annualexposure for the workers would be 27 person-rem. The maximally exposedperson from normal transportation activities would receive an annual exposureof 1.4E-04 mrem per year. The estimated total effective dose equivalentrate for various sources of natural background radiation for this areais approximately 300 millirem per year (National Council on Radiation Protectionand Measurements (NCRP) Report 94). For the purposes of environmental analysis, the impact from a postulatedaccidental fire in stored waste was assessed. This accident was assessedbecause it has the greatest potential for release and would bound a spectrumof potential accidents that could occur. For this postulated accident,the total radioactive inventory is not involved, and only 0.3 percent (orabout one trailer load) is assumed to be ignited and to release radioactiveeffluent. This fraction was chosen because a sequence of events that wouldresult in the complete combustion of all the wastes is unlikely. The dosefrom an accidental fire to the maximally exposed individual is estimatedto be about 0.45 mrem for a fire. Such a dose does not exceed EPA ProtectiveAction Guides (PAGs) of one rem whole-body dose and five rem thyroid dose.Although the dose estimates would not necessitate offsite protective actions,ALARON has implemented fire protection and emergency-preparedness plans.The potential for radiological exposure to transport workers and to membersof the general public in the United States due to routine transportationwas assessed in NUREG-0170. Based on the total volume of waste receivedeach month, an estimated one shipment per month would be required to shipwaste to and from ALARON's warehouse. The dose to a maximally exposed individualfrom the passage of a truck traveling at a speed of 25 miles per hour oncea month was calculated at a distance of 25 and 100 meters. No credit wastaken for shielding by structures. Under these conditions, the maximumindividual dose due to transportation would be about 3.4E-05 mrem per year.<ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusions </ITAG>Based on the foregoing assessment, the NRC staff concludes that the environmentaleffects of normal compaction operations for the increased volumes of DAWare expected to be extremely small. For all radionuclides, the maximumunrestricted area concentrations are calculated to be well below the maximumpermissible concentrations specified in 10 CFR 20.106 and 10 CFR part 20,appendix B. <ITAG tagnum="84">Alternatives to the Proposed Action </ITAG>The principal alternative to the proposed action is that of no action.Since the proposed action will not result in any significant impact, choosingthe aforementioned alternative over the proposed action is not justified.<ITAG tagnum="84">Alternative Use of Resources </ITAG>Because the proposed action does not involve any changes in the scope ortype of operation presently authorized, there are no alternative uses ofresources other than those previously assessed. <ITAG tagnum="84">Agencies and Persons Contacted </ITAG>No persons or agencies outside the Pennsylvania Department of EnvironmentalResources or the NRC were contacted in connection with the preparationof this Environmental Assessment. <ITAG tagnum="84">Finding of No Significant Impact </ITAG>NRC's Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards has prepared anEnvironmental Assessment dated July 31, 1989, related to the amendmentof Materials License No. 37-20826-01, entitled ``Environmental Assessmentfor ALARON Corporation.'' On the basis of this assessment, NRC has concludedthat environmental impacts that would be created by the proposed licensingaction would not be significant and do not warrant the preparation of anEnvironmental Impact Statement. Accordingly, it has been determined thata Finding of No Significant Impact is appropriate.
