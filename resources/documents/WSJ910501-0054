The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 10.89 points higherat 2887.87 points in active trading. But the FederalReserve's cut in the discount rate -- which the Fed chargesfinancial institutions for short-term loans -- to 5.5% from6% failed to bail out small stocks from their recent sinkingspell. The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 3.02 to 484.72.</LP><TEXT>   Long-term Treasury bonds rose less than half a point, orless than $5 for each $1,000 of face amount. Traders said theFed's move would have produced a more enthusiastic reactionif it weren't for the impending Treasury sale of roughly $36billion next week.   Currency traders weren't hesitant. They dumped the dollar,pushing it down 2.5% against the German mark.   Stock market investors initially greeted the Fed'sdiscount-rate cut with a 30-point lift in the Dow Jonesindustrials. That gain rapidly faded, though, and bymidsession the industrial average had retreated into negativeterritory. A late rally pushed prices higher again, but thatpush also faded before the final bell.   Analysts deciphered investors' hot-and-cold reaction asmeaning a discount-rate cut no longer is viewed as sufficientto pry the economy out of recession. Investors now want tosee banks follow the Fed's lead and cut the prime rate, whichdirectly affects loans to consumers and corporations. As oflate yesterday, none of the big banks had lowered the primerate, which stands at 9%.   But analysts said it's only a matter of time before thebanks conform. &quot;The prime rate has got to come down,&quot; saidBernard G. Schaeffer, executive director of InvestmentResearch Institute, an advisory service.   He said the gap between the discount rate and the primerate already was unusually large before the Fed's cutyesterday. If banks still drag their heels in lowering theprime rate, he said the Fed probably will reduce short-terminterest rates even further. &quot;The Fed won't be finishedeasing until that prime comes down.&quot;   &quot;Most of us expected {a discount rate cut} in the nextcouple of weeks, but the timing has taken us all bysurprise,&quot; said George Magnus, chief international economistat S.G. Warburg andamp; Co. in London. &quot;It was particularlywell-timed, because the dollar by itself had already run outof speed.&quot;   He added: &quot;Since the Germans and Japanese said pointedlythat they see no need to change interest rates for themselvesfor the time being, the discount-rate cut will push thedollar a little bit lower.&quot;   But &quot;by no means is {Tuesday's} movement suggestive thatthe dollar's bull trend is over,&quot; said Richard Witten,partner in charge of currency trading at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co.The dollar's 17% rise since mid-February, to 1.70 marks from1.45, wasn't abnormal, he added, and probably isn't finished.&quot;The rise in the dollar has been more a story of Germanpessimism than dollar optimism.&quot;   In major market action:                                                                                                          Stock prices rose in heavy trading. Volume on the New YorkStock Exchange totaled 204.9 million shares. Advancing issueson the Big Board led decliners 843 to 757.                                                                                                          Bond prices climbed. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark30-year bond slipped to 8.18%.                                                                                                          The dollar tumbled.
