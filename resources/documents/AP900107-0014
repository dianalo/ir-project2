U.S. officials confirmed the ships were inthe Atlantic but said it was for training exercises.   In Washington, a Pentagon source said the aircraft carrier USSJohn F. Kennedy has been chosen to lead an anti-drug effort off thecoast of Colombia, but that final decisions on when the warshipwill be put to work had not been made. The source spoke oncondition of anonymity.   The U.S. Embassy in Bogota released a statement in response tothe Colombian radio reports, saying the United States is steppingup air and sea patrols in the Caribbean in an attempt to blockcocaine smuggling.   But the embassy statement also did not say when the operationwas to start.   ``All operations will be conducted in international waters farfrom the Colombian coast,'' the embassy said. ``Contacts with boatsand planes will follow norms dictated by international laws andpractices.'' It did not say how many ships and planes were involved.   The radio networks Caracol and RCN, in reports from stringerreporters, quoted unidentified Pentagon sources as saying theKennedy and the cruiser Virginia were headed for Colombia'sCaribbean coast to begin setting up a blockade.   Caracol and RCN did not not give any details of their sources.   At the Pentagon, information officer Chris Cimko confirmed theKennedy and the Virginia sailed Thursday from their home port inNorfolk, Va., and said it was for routine training in the Atlantic.   White House spokeswoman Alixe Glen said U.S. ships had beenslated to sail to Colombia to help with the anti-drug effort. LaterSaturday, she said she had been mistaken and learned that it wasnot definite ships would go to Colombia, but only that they were ona routine operations in the Atlantic.   A Bush administration official denied any blockade was underway, but he said U.S. officials were in discussions with theColombian government regarding possible stepped-up interdictionefforts by the U.S. military.   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said last week thatfinal plans were being made for U.S. military actions to helpinterdict supply routes out of Colombia.   The daily newspaper El Tiempo said it was unable to confirm theradio reports. It said a U.S. blockade in the Caribbean made littlesense when cocaine already is being smuggled into the United Statesfrom Pacific waters from Peru and Ecuador, as well as Brazil andVenezuela.   The New York Times, in its Sunday additions, said Colombiabalked at the stationing of U.S. naval vessels off its coast.   The Times said U.S. officials planned to announce the drug planearlier but Colombian authorities refused this past week to meetwith an American team sent to explain the Navy plan. Administrationofficials said, however, that they are confident ColombianPresident Virgilio Barco Vargas will cooperate.   Quoting an unidentified administration official speaking oncondition of anonymity, the Times reported that the Colombiansfeared the United States might use its Panama operation as aprecedent to enter other countries in pursuit of people wanted onAmerican drug trafficking charges.   Meanwhile, a communique supposedly from drug traffickers saidSaturday that traffickers will kill the abducted son of apresidential adviser unless four people arrested by Colombia'ssecret police are freed soon.   The police said they had never heard of the four mentioned inthe communique. The communique was received by fax at the Bogotaheadquarters of Caracol, which gave The Associated Press a copy ofthe note.   The kidnapped man is Alvarro Diego Montoya, a Bogota executivewho is the son of presidential adviser German Montoya, Barco'sclosest confidant.   Montoya's son was kidnapped Dec. 20 in Bogota as he was leavingthe offices of his financial services firm.</TEXT></DOC>
