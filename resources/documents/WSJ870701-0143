Much more is going on, however, than another quadrennial nominating process. All these men are running in the wake of a rare two-term presidency. We now are going to find out if Ronald Reagan's legacy will set the course for the next generation of American politics.    Mr. Reagan's electoral success has meant the virtual disappearance of the Republican Party's liberal wing. The battle now is between Main Street Republicans -- party regulars such as Gerald Ford and Howard Baker -- and Sun Belt Republicans -- largely populist conservatives whose natural leader has been Ronald Reagan.    George Bush has done much to reconcile these two factions. GOP House members from Jim Leach on the left to Bob Dornan on the right are impressed with his solid record as vice president. And while Iowa and New Hampshire haven't been kind to front-runners in the past, no candidate comes close to Mr. Bush's organizational strength in those two states.    Bob Dole has proved a skillful leader of Senate Republicans. His mastery of the legislative process convinces many that Mr. Dole could best face down an increasingly irresponsible Congress -- except on taxes, where he has shown a past willingness to join Democrats in digging deeper into taxpayers' pockets.    If Republicans ever are to form a true majority party they will have to attract groups that generally have spurned them in the past: blacks, Hispanics and the poor. No one has tried harder to broaden the Republican Party's base than Rep. Jack Kemp. He was the only GOP candidate to attend a key Hispanic conference last week, and his speeches draw people who rarely attend a political event.    Pundits say Mr. Kemp is low in the polls and has fund-raising trouble. Polls and money may be the easiest way to chart a campaign's progress, but ideas are the propellant that can get a candidate noticed. In 1984, Gary Hart couldn't pay the phone bill, but his &quot;new ideas&quot; helped him pole-vault over a half-dozen other candidates in the early primaries. &quot;Ideological candidates with committed supporters can fool the experts,&quot; says political analyst Stuart Rothenberg. &quot;They often do poorly in every poll but the one on Election Day.&quot;    Pete du Pont is further proof that supply-side ideas are alive and kicking. &quot;This is not a campaign for the fainthearted,&quot; he warns audiences before he proposes to cut tax rates again, end farm subsidies in five years and open up the Postal Service to competition. But Mr. du Pont is no mere visionary. Like Mr. Reagan, he had two successful terms as a state governor during which he persuaded Delaware's Democratic legislature to cut spending and pass a constitutional amendment requiring a three-fifths vote for raising taxes.    Pat Robertson also is bringing hundreds of new voters to GOP meetings. As we pointed out after last week's Supreme Court creation-science ruling, many evangelical Christians feel they are the only group that many elites have no qualms about ridiculing. More and more of these Christians see the GOP as their natural home.    The Republicans at least have their first string on the field. The Democrats' first team -- Cuomo, Robb, Bradley, Nunn -- looks like holdouts in a contract dispute with the party's owners. So in desperation the Democrats have brought up seven hopefuls from the AAA squad. A poll taken last month of 303 Democrats who had attended the 1984 Iowa caucus found that 65% were undecided about a 1988 candidate. An astounding 42% of the undecided weren't even sure which candidate they were &quot;most interested in taking a closer look at.&quot;    Democrats think the voters' presumed desire for change gives them a good shot at regaining the presidency. But so far the only candidates advocating concrete policies that are new and constructive are Messrs. Kemp and du Pont. The major new ideas flowing from the Democrats so far are to relabel a tax increase as &quot;new revenue&quot; and protectionism as &quot;fair trade.&quot;    Barring a large political misstep, the Republican Party still must be counted as the more likely source of the next president. Mr. Reagan's conservatism is now the dominant force in the party. That's why the second round in the fight for the party's soul -- how far and how fast the conservative principles of the Reagan legacy should be carried forward -- is so important and so hotly contested. </TEXT></DOC>
