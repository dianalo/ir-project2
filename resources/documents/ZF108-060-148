(letter to the editor)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Bhandarkar, Dileep; Brown, David M.andM;</AUTHOR><DESCRIPT/><TEXT>LETTERSandM;MORE ABOUT VECTORSandM;It was very gratifying to see VAX vectors covered on the front page ofDigital Review.andP;  (See &quot;DEC Offers Multiple Methods of Handling VectorProcessing,&quot; Nov. 27, 1989, page 1.)andP;  We are most excited about the newperformance levels that vector processing will bring to our customers.andP;  Welaud your attempts to educate your readers on this exciting new technology.andM;There are few issues I'd like to clarify.andP;  First, the picture on your frontpage shows the vector processor module for the VAX 6000 Models 410-440 andnot that for the VAX 9000 series.andP;  The single board shown in that pictureimplements the VAX vector architecture and connects to a VAX scalar processorin the VAX 6000 machines.andM;Furthermore, the vector processor is fully integrated with the CPU in boththe VAX 6000 and VAX 9000 systems.andP;  In both cases, the scalar processorfetches and decodes instructions and passes vector instructions to the vectorprocessor through a specially dedicated path, which is separate from thesystem bus.andP;  The VAX 6000 vector processor has its own connection to thesystem's memory bus because it uses a 1MB vector cache that is not accessedby the scalar processor.andP;  On the VAX 9000 system, the vector processor fitson the same board as the CPU and uses the scalar cache and its path tomemory.andP;  In spite of these implementation differences, both processors runthe same vector code.andM;The approach the article refers to as Load/Store uses vector registers anddoes not necessarily use a cache.andP;  For example, Cray uses vector registersbut no cache.andP;  The article correctly points out that IBM uses a synchronousapproach.andP;  However, contrary to what the article says, Cray does not use asynchronous approach.andM;Also contrary to the article, the vectorizing compiler does not needdirectives.andP;  It automatically vectorizes Fortran programs.andM;Dileep Bhandarkar VAX Vector Architect Digital Equipment Corp. Boxborough,Mass.andM;NEARLY PERFECTandM;I am responding to a letter in which W.R.andP;  Thorne requested information fromusers of WordPerfect Office.andP;  (See &quot;Any Word on WordPerfect?&quot; Dec. 11, 1989,page 32.)andM;We started investigating office automation products for the VAX environmentshortly after receiving our hardware in October 1988.andP;  We hoped to find aproduct or products to provide word processing, electronic mail and relatedoffice automation functions, preferably from a single vendor.andP;  The only twovendors that appeared to do this were DEC with its All-in 1 products andWordperfect with WordPerfect version 4.2 (now 5.03) and Office.andM;Our decision to purchase the WordPerfect products was based on severalfactors.andP;  The first was that we were able to purchase a complete copy of thesoftware for trial on our own hardware for $35.andP;  Next was the software'srelatively low consumption of resources (CPU cycles).andP;  The price of thecombined WordPerfect products was also significantly less than All-in-1.andP;  TheWordPerfect software for the VAX is completely data-file-compatible with thePC versions of the software.andP;  The software supports many different printersattached to our Digital network, including the HP LaserJet.andP;  And theassistance received from WordPerfect during our installation of the productsfor evaluation was above and beyond any expectation.andP;  This gave us thefeeling that the company would be available for assistance on any problem,which has proven to be true.andM;I do not wish to sound like a zealot, but our experience with these productshas been very positive.andP;  We will be implementing them throughout thecorporation this year for a total installed user base of 170.andP;  We will alsobe installing Wordperfect's PlanPerfect spreadsheets for the VAX during thissame period.andP;  No product is truly perfect, but these have proven to be veryclose.andM;David M.
