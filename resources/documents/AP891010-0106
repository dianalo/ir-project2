The Communist Party, officially called the Hungarian SocialistWorkers' Party when it was reorganized after the 1956 revolution,decided Saturday to become the Hungarian Socialist Party andadopted a manifesto pledging to bring democracy to the country.   The delegates to the party congress then named Rezsoe Nyers, whoheaded the Communist Party, as president of the new party.   With the same leader, a slightly different name and the samemembership as the old party, it remains unclear what directions thenew organization will take.   The Hungarian Communist Party was modeled on the SovietCommunist Party in which the party elite made all the majorday-to-day decisions and the general membership had little say informulating policy.   A Communist Party believes in the efficency of central economicplanning and all property is state-owned in an effort to end``exploitation of the working masses.''   One important aspect of communism is that it concerns itself notonly with the economy but with almost every aspect of society,including political life, education and public information.   However, under the 32-year leadership of Janos Kadar, theHungarian party allowed some small private enterprise in the 1970sand was relatively tolerant of dissent.   In the past year, the reformist Communist leadership took stepstoward transition to a more democratic society by advocating freeelections and a market economy.   The program of the newly founded Hungarian Socialist Party makesno mention of Marxism and accepts a market economy that includesprivate ownership.   Socialist parties in the West have favoured some state influencein the national economy, stressing it is necessary to ensure publicwelfare and national health programs, a point also emphasized bythe new Hungarian party.   The new party also has adopted Western Socialist ideals such asguaranteed human rights and freedom of movement and freedom ofconscience.   The party's program advocates a ``social market economy,''rejecting democratic centralism and favoring self-government.   It wishes to compete for support among the electorate along withother parties and no longer relies on its leading role in societybeing secured in the constitution.   The party accepts the fact that there is a plurality ofinterests in society and rejects the notion that there is a single``correct line'' on everything.</TEXT></DOC>
