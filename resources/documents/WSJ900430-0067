As dividend yields havefallen, many of the thrifts have been reducing their holdingsin the Federal Home Loan Banks.   Part of the decline in dividend yields is caused by aceiling imposed by the banks' regulatory board. The ceilingis roughly one percentage point above the federal funds rate,placing the current dividend yields between 8.2% and 8.5%.The funds rate is what banks charge each other on overnightloans.   But yields are also suffering from provisions of thefederal thrift-bailout legislation that took effect inAugust. Among those provisions is a requirement that theFederal Home Loan Banks contribute $300 million annually,regardless of earnings, to pay for the cost of failedthrifts.   In addition, the banks are watching their major source ofrevenue -- loans, or advances, to member thrifts -- dry up asthrifts cut borrowings in an effort to shrink to meet thelaw's stringent capital standards. The decrease in borrowingsis also helping push down dividend yields.   &quot;As this bank shrinks, it is going to be more and moredifficult to pay reasonable dividends,&quot; said George Barclay,president of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas. For thefirst time, the Dallas bank will tap a reserve fund to keepits dividend yield at about 8.5% for the second quarter, hesaid.   Mr. Barclay said the Dallas bank has fed the reserve bydeliberately keeping dividends low during the past severalquarters to counteract the loss of revenue as borrowings bymember thrifts decline. Advances from the Federal Home LoanBank of Dallas fell from a peak of $27.5 billion in June 1989to the current level of about $19 billion, Mr. Barclay said.   Other more-profitable banks, such as the one in SanFrancisco, had been paying member thrifts substantiallyhigher dividend yields than the Dallas bank. But that hasended. The San Francisco bank dropped its yield from about12% in early 1989 to the current rate of about 8.5%.   &quot;The real concern about this is that net worth bepreserved,&quot; said Ray Martin, chairman and chief executiveofficer of Coast Savings Financial Inc., parent of CoastSavings andamp; Loan Association of Los Angeles. Coast Savings is ashareholder of the San Francisco Federal Home Loan Bank.   Mr. Martin said Coast has reduced the amount of itsholdings in the San Francisco bank by about $240 million toabout $100 million. Those holdings represent about 49% ofCoast's tangible net worth, according to the Salomon Brothersreport.   Coast isn't concerned as long as Congress and theregulators don't do anything to erode the earnings of theFederal Home Loan Banks further, Mr. Martin said.</TEXT></DOC>
