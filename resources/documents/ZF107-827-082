And that list of buts is long: Not many PC applicationssupport downloadable fonts, very few PC applications automatically downloadthem, type sizes are much more limited and almost always fixed at just a fewsizes, the reproduction quality of the bit-mapped fonts commonly used in thePC world (for printing to the PC-standard LaserJets and their clones) isusually inferior to that of PostScript fonts for the Mac, and on and on.andM;Put simply, the Mac provides a far more congenial environment for producingbetter-looking documents and for producing good-looking type.andM;No matter how much someone might quibble with that, one thing is inarguable:There are more, and far better, type-manipulation tools for the Macintoshthan for any other microcomputer.andP;  So, this month and next, I'm going to lookat what's new in type on the Mac and at several font-management and-manipulation tools that take the last step in producing typographically richdocuments and presentations.andP;  These tools take seconds to install, and you'llneed only minutes to learn how to use them to simplify your font-managementchores.andM;One of the most useful Mac type tools is Suitcase from Fifth GenerationSystems (Baton Rouge, Louisiana; [504] 291-7221).andP;  In version II, thisindispensable $79 utility lets you bundle fonts (and DAs) into kits, or&quot;suitcases.&quot;andM;This has two important advantages for Mac type mavens.andP;  First, it gives youaccess to as many typefaces as you want, despite the System's usual limit of500 fonts (actually, 500 font sizes).andP;  And second, if you have a lot offonts, it means you needn't endure those endless scrolls through menus ofzillions of fonts unrelated to the work at hand.andM;The former advantage is not as important as the latter, since not too manyMac users presently bump into the System limit.andP;  But if you get into seriousgraphics work on the Mac and start installing lots of screen-font sizes (asyou should), you'll hit that wall before long.andM;By allowing you to create suitcase subsets of your font library -- fontcollections such as NLTR for your group's newsletter, CORRESP for yourcorrespondence, and SHOW for your Persuasion or PowerPoint desktoppresentations -- Suitcase II lets you &quot;mount&quot; just the group of typefaces youneed for a specific job.andP;  And not having to scroll through all the fontsyou'd never use in a particular job saves a lot of time and frustration.andM;A feature new to Suitcase II lets you see the actual typeface, not just itsname, in the drop-down menus.andP;  It takes a while to build that typeface menueach time you use it, though, so this new feature can actually slow you down.andM;The Suitcase people wisely make this feature optional.andP;  Hold down the Optionkey when clicking on the Fonts menu, and you'll see font names listed intheir typefaces; omit the Option key, and you're back to full-speed menuswith the fonts listed in the usual System (Chicago) typeface.andM;MasterJuggler from ALSoft (Spring, Texas; [713] 353-4090) also delivers thiskind of type-juggling wizardry and was first to show fonts listed in theirtypefaces.andP;  I like MasterJuggler, but either program can meet your needs andSuitcase's approach seems a little tidier to me.andM;A better way of seeing type names listed in their typefaces is offered byMenu Fonts 2, a $49 utility from Beyond (Tucson, Arizona; [602] 290-9790).andO;Menu Fonts not only lets you see pulldown lists of font names in theirtypefaces, but it also does so at top speed.andP;  A list of the fonts installedin the System, Suitcase, or Juggler files is stored in RAM, which makes themavailable almost instantly.andM;Menu Fonts also lets you see fonts in larger sizes (up to 24 points) and evenshows them in color if you wish.andP;  But the best thing about Menu Fonts is aspeed-key shortcut for jumping to the bottom of a list of font names.andP;  Clickon the Fonts menu, move the cursor arrow to one of the first font names, andtype in the first letter of the name of the font you want while holding downthe mouse button.andP;  The cursor instantly jumps to that part of the alphabet.andM;Anyone who's waited through tedious scrolls down to Zapf Dingbats, Univers,Venice, or another font near the end of the alphabetized list will find thisfeature a godsend.andM;I forgo the larger-type-size and color-listing features of Menu Fonts,because both slow down an otherwise speedy program.andP;  And note that when youchange your list of available fonts -- by adding new font files to yourSystem Folder or by creating or changing Suitcase or Juggler files -- MenuFonts takes a minute or two to rebuild its font list.andM;Still, Menu Fonts is an exemplary time-saving memory-jogger for those of uswho have so many fonts installed that we can't remember just what Janson orAvenir or Belwe really looks like.andM;Another essential type tool on the Mac is FontDisplay, a stand-alone utilitythat produces on-screen and printed keyboard maps, lists of installed fonts,and tables of installed fonts in decimal, octal, or hexa-decimal notation.andM;If you use only the built-in LaserWriter ROM fonts, FontDisplay isn'tnecessary, but you'll need it the minute you start adding fonts, especiallyoddball ones such as Adobe's wonderful Carta font for mapmaking.andP;  Formerlyshareware, FontDisplay (version 5.4.4a) is now commercially distributed byauthor Jeff Shulman (Ridgefield, Connecticut; [203] 792-1521) for just $50--abargain for its new features and more-robust code.andM;Next time we'll look at three farther-out type-manipulation tools and afourth one you probably already own that can speed up PageMaker printing.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
