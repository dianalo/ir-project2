Far too often, said psychologist Judith Wallerstein, the courtsare ``putting children in the middle of the battlefield.''   Wallerstein, head of the Center for the Family in Transition,helped conduct a study of joint custody arrangements, which havebecome increasingly popular in recent years.   Findings from the study were presented here Wednesday at theannual meeting of the American Orthopsychiatric Association.   Researchers at the non-profit research and counseling center,located in Corte Madera, studied the children of 100 couples whowent through bitter divorces and had custody arrangements decidedby the courts. In about one-third of those cases, joint custody wasordered.   Researchers assessed the psychological health of the children bytesting, interviews and talks with their parents, and found thatchildren were psychologically worse off _ more depressed, withdrawnand uncommunicative _ if joint custody was imposed.   The researchers also studied 93 children whose parents partedamicably and chose their own custody arrangements. Again, aboutone-third of the cases involved joint custody.   Children in that group were not affected by custodyarrangements, the study found.   In all, 33 states have enacted legislation that permits courtsto order joint custody, evidence of the growing trend in its favor,Wallerstein said.   ``It's very important for children of divorces to maintain acontinuous relationship with both parents, but that doesn't have tobe with the child going back and forth,'' Wallerstein said Thursdayin an interview.   ``What's important is the relationship'' between parent andchild, she said. ``It is quality of relationship sustained overtime.''   Jeremy Fogel, supervising judge for Family Court in Santa ClaraCounty, said the study confirmed his observations. ``An equal timeshare will not solve the problems of a very conflicted relationshipbetween parents,'' Fogel said.   A family law attorney in Oakland, Carole H. Rochlin, said hefears some people may use the findings to argue against jointcustody.   ``We'd get back to the days where either one parent or the otherhas custody _ where we had these destructive custody fights,'' saidRochlin. He heads a group called Equal Rights for Fathers, whichfavors joint custody.</TEXT></DOC>
