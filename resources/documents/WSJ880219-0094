Miami had Burdines, Houston Foleys and Los Angeles Bullock's.    Each store had a local flavor, and for countless loyal customers each was the only place to shop. Few shoppers knew one thing, however: These stores were all outposts of the Federated Department Stores empire.    &quot;If you grew up in the '50s and '60s, Federated stores were part of your upbringing,&quot; says retail consultant Carol Farmer. &quot;You went with your mother, who wore white gloves and a hat, and you were never disappointed. There were buyers on the floors who knew all the merchandise and would even tie and tuck a new dress or shirt for you -- and make you feel as if you were in Paris.&quot;    Baby boomers vividly remembered such excursions and gave the stores every chance to remain their favorites. A graying Federated, though, didn't know how to keep a new generation happy. Now, even if it survives the fierce takeover struggle embroiling it, the nation's largest department-store operator is likely to be left in tatters.    Who's to blame? For dozens of current and former executives and other retailing experts, the answer is Howard Goldfeder, the former Bloomingdale's coat buyer who has led Cincinnati-based Federated for the past seven years. During that time, the company has underperformed rivals in both earnings and sales. The lackluster results depressed its stock price and left it vulnerable to raiders like Campeau Corp., the Canadian company trying to seize it for its rich assets.    &quot;He inherited the premier department-store chain in the country and turned it into an also-ran,&quot; says a former Federated executive who left three years ago (and who, like many past and present employees interviewed for this story, didn't want his name used). Walter Loeb, vice president of Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., contends, &quot;To some extent, Goldfeder's been a victim of changing shopping habits and demographics. But he hasn't the decisive leadership needed to respond to those changes.&quot;    Critics take the 61-year-old Mr. Goldfeder to task for failing to make the daring moves needed to thwart discounters and savvy specialty stores. While he has tried to fight this growing legion with specialty and discount outlets like the Children's Place and a chain of Filene's Basements, he hasn't rapidly built these businesses nationally. Mr. Goldfeder declined to be interviewed, nor would the company take questions for this article.    Mr. Goldfeder is an intense chief executive who dominates discussions, and his combative management style -- he has been known to publicly humiliate subordinates -- has sometimes stifled merchandising creativity. It also has cost him some key retailing talent. &quot;He'll berate you for not knowing that ladies' imported knitwear dropped one-tenth of a percent the previous month, but not let you risk expanding a fast-growing department,&quot; says one defector. Now, many of Federated's stores seem faded versions of the past: familiar but lacking the distinct fashions, personal service and elegant ambiance that were their trademark.    Consider Lazarus's flagship Columbus store. It needs paint, light bulbs are dimming, and merchandise is hard to find. A new children's clothing department in the basement would seem to offer bargain prices, but the $60 dresses for six-month-olds are decidedly upscale.    Displayed on the first floor are out-of-fashion handbags. And while a wine department is tucked away on the fifth and a counter offers cheese by the pound, there is no place to go for gourmet foods. The verdict in Columbus: While the city has become more cosmopolitan, Lazarus hasn't kept up.    Bloomingdale's, Federated's plum, remains a tourist lure and weekend gathering spot for trendy New Yorkers, and its sales and profits have been strong. Yet it too has lost a bit of its edge. A former menswear buyer there recalls how a decade ago buyers &quot;walked the floors watching shoppers and determining exactly what they wanted to buy. Now buyers operate out of separate offices and rarely see customers.&quot; A dirty display case, he adds, once incurred the wrath of a merchandise manager, who &quot;kicked it with his foot, shattering the glass. Now nobody's there to do that.&quot;    Certainly, the challenges that department stores face aren't simple these days. Replacing their once-loyal cadre of housewives with similar tastes is a diverse mix of shoppers, including career women, men and teen-agers, who find malls more alluring than downtown. So department stores have had to expand to the suburbs, and store presidents who once ran a single outlet must oversee several -- concerning themselves with real estate as well as clothes racks.    &quot;When department stores were small enough to be run in a hands-on way, they reflected the character of the people on the premises -- and they were special,&quot; says Geraldine Stutz, the publisher of Random House's Panache Press and former president of New York's tony Henri Bendel. &quot;The specialness evaporates when a hands-on operation becomes a finger on a monolithic hand.&quot;    And at Federated, Mr. Goldfeder unabashedly wields that kind of control. An obsessive number-cruncher, he has tried to yank efficiencies from his far-flung company -- which includes 10 department-store chains and five non-department-store divisions. For example, he merged Cincinnati-based Shillito's into Lazarus and also combined four other Federated divisions into two. He has begun to centralize services like purchasing and data processing.    But the consolidations have been painfully slow. &quot;Everything is studied to death under Howard,&quot; says a former Federated executive, who contends that decisions take at least twice as long as they should. Analysts who follow the company agree that benefits of the cost-cutting programs have yet to reach the bottom line.    A workaholic who has spent his career at Federated except for four years with May, Mr. Goldfeder isn't the bon vivant some other retailing executives are. He doesn't boast an expensive art collection or a bevy of lavish residences such as, for instance, The Limited's Leslie Wexner. He keeps a New York apartment, but it is also used by his mother. His home phone numbers are listed. Golf is his only outside recreation.    He often involves himself in the smallest decisions -- like whether to spend $100,000 replacing worn tile in a particular store -- but frequently fails to plan strategy for key divisions. One subordinate recalls that Mr. Goldfeder spent weeks debating whether to buy three Toledo stores to add to Federated's Gold Circle chain. By the time he gave the go-ahead, the stores had been snapped up by a discount chain, Hills Department Stores.    Though starting specialty and discount operations, Mr. Goldfeder hasn't expanded nearly fast enough to take full benefit from Federated's size and marketing clout. This is in sharp contrast to rival The Limited, which is known for acquiring a niche specialty chain like Victoria's Secret, then opening hundreds of such stores elsewhere and servicing them all centrally. Federated has been &quot;very indecisive&quot; by contrast, says consultant Ann Hunt of Korn/ Ferry International. &quot;They put their toe in the water with such non-department-store businesses as MainStreet and Filene's Basement but then, with one bad season, they pulled back.&quot;    During a recent five-year stretch, Federated's performance has lagged behind several competitors'. Its growth in earnings per share, for instance, averaged 3% a year, lower than the industry's 4% average rate and sharply off from Sears's 8% and May's 9%. Its profit margin has been at about 2.8%, compared with 3.4% at Sears and 4.1% at May. And Federated's return on shareholders' equity declined to 10.7% at the end of fiscal 1986 from 13.6% five years before.    Customers don't know any of this, but they know something has changed. A once-faithful Filene's shopper illustrates what has been lost. Michaele Weissman grew up in Boston and recalls purchasing all her clothes for summer camps, school proms and college there. When she returned to Boston a few years ago from a period in New York, she assumed Filene's would still be her favorite.    But, says the 41-year-old author and mother of a young child, &quot;they don't market to me anymore. Their clothes seem to be for teen-agers or women who can afford $700 for a skirt. And departments are so chopped up, it's hard to find anything. I shop between meetings and don't have time to search and search.&quot; Her new favorite: B.A.T Industries' Saks Fifth Avenue.    Customers aren't the only disgruntled constituency. Animosity toward Mr. Goldfeder within Federated's managerial ranks has surged since Campeau launched its takeover bid late last month. Managers complain that the only internal battle reports they get are photocopies of press releases.    They are especially bitter about lucrative &quot;golden parachutes&quot; recently granted Mr. Goldfeder and a handful of top executives. Morale has plummeted at the company's Cincinnati headquarters since directors announced a restructuring proposal that includes the sale of all of Federated's non-department-store divisions. One former manager says he has received several frantic phone calls from colleagues &quot;asking me who are the best executive recruiters in retail.&quot;    Rumors persist about just how much support Mr. Goldfeder retains with the company's 14 outside directors. None will comment publicly, and, as a group, they continue to show support for the embattled chairman. One source close to the takeover battle credits his survival so far to his knowledge of minute details about the company, his long tenure there and his ability to charm. &quot;He's the kind of person who can yell at you one minute and pat you on the back the next,&quot; this insider says, &quot;and so far he has been very controlled and relaxed at board meetings.&quot;    But even if he keeps control of Federated, he will be presiding over a shrunken empire. Any restructuring or management-led leveraged buy-out -- two possible defenses -- would leave Federated's surviving operations heavily in debt. And, to match Campeau's latest $61-a-share, or $5.47 billion, tender offer, Federated almost certainly would have to shed not just specialty and discount units but also some of its tradition-rich department stores.    That prospect dismays Ralph Lazarus, the former chairman and chief executive. &quot;I worked at Federated for 50 years, and I'm probably as responsible for building this company as anyone,&quot; says Mr. Lazarus, the son of the company's founder. &quot;I feel very sad about what's happening now.&quot;    ---             Federated's Collection of Stores                                                  1986 Sales Store              Location      Type      No. (in millions) - Abraham andamp; Straus   N.Y. area    Department   14   $  778.6 Bloomingdale's     Northeast,   Department   16    1,050.0                    Dallas,                    S.
