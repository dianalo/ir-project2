Introduction </ITAG>EPA is amending the TSCA Good Laboratory Practice standards (40 CFR part792) to incorporate many of the changes made by FDA to its GLP regulationsand to expand the scope of TSCA GLP standards. Public reporting for this collection of information is estimated to benegligible, including time for reviewing instructions, searching existingdata sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completingand reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding theburden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information,including suggestions for reducing this burden, to Chief, Information PolicyBranch, PM-223, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington,DC 20503. A. Legal Authority On November 29, 1983 (48 FR 53922), EPA promulgated the GLP standards underthe authority of TSCA section 4 (90 Stat. 2006, 15 U.S.C. 2603). Section4(a) of TSCA authorizes the EPA Administrator to require, by rule, thatmanufacturers (including importers) and processors of identified chemicalsubstances and mixtures (chemicals) test such chemicals if certain findingsare made. Section 4(b)(1) of TSCA specifies that each test rule shall includestandards for the development of test data. These standards are definedin section 3(12) of TSCA to mean a prescription of_<ITAG tagnum="21">(A) the_ </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(i) health and environmental effects, and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) information relating to the toxicity, persistence, and othercharacteristics which affect health and the environment, for which testdata for a chemical substance or mixture are to be developed and any analysisthat is to be performed on such data, and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(B) to the extent necessary to assure that data respecting such effectsand characteristics are reliable and adequate_ </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(i) the manner in which such data are to be developed, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) the specification of any test protocol or methodology to be employedin the development of such data, and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(iii) such other requirements as are necessary to provide such assurance.</ITAG>In summary, the specific authority to issue the GLP standards is providedby section 4(b)(1) of TSCA, which is further explained by the definitionsin sections 3(12)(B)(i) and 3(12)(B)(iii).In addition, EPA also requires sponsors to utilize these GLP standardswhen conducting testing under TSCA section 4 testing consent agreementsand will include provisions to adhere to these GLP standards in those agreements(see 40 CFR 790.60(a)(7)). Also, it is EPA's policy that all data developedas a result of rules or orders under section 5 of TSCA should be in accordancewith the GLP standards. If data developed under section 5 of TSCA are notgenerated in accordance with the GLP standards, EPA may elect to considersuch data insufficient to evaluate the health effects, environmental effects,and fate of the chemical(s).B. Background EPA originally published TSCA GLP standards in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of November 29, 1983 (48 FR 53922), which werecodified as 40 CFR part 792. At the same time, EPA published GLP standardsapplicable to testing under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and RodenticideAct (FIFRA, 48 FR 53963, 40 CFR part 160). These regulations were promulgatedin response to investigations by EPA and FDA during the mid-1970s whichrevealed that some studies submitted to the Agencies had not been conductedin accordance with acceptable laboratory practices. Some studies had beenconducted so poorly that the resulting data could not be relied upon inEPA's regulatory decision-making process. For instance, some studies hadbeen submitted which did not adhere to specified protocols, were conductedby underqualified personnel and supervisors, or were not adequately monitoredby study sponsors. In some cases, results were selectively reported, underreported,or fraudulently reported. In addition, it was discovered that some testingfacilities displayed poor animal care procedures and inadequate record-keepingtechniques. The TSCA GLP standards specify minimum practices and procedureswhich must be followed in order to ensure the quality and integrity ofdata submitted in accordance with TSCA section 4 requirements. The 1983TSCA GLP standards also established a policy that persons should complywith the GLP standards when submitting data in response to rules and ordersissued under section 5 of TSCA, and when submitting data to EPA voluntarily.When EPA published its final TSCA and FIFRA GLP standards in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of November 29, 1983, the Agency sought to harmonizethe requirements and language with those regulations promulgated by theFDA in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of December 22, 1978 (43 FR 60013), and codifiedas 21 CFR part 58. Differences between the two Agencies' current GLP regulationsexist only to the extent necessary to reflect the Agencies' different statutoryresponsibilities under TSCA, FIFRA, and the Federal Food, Drug and CosmeticAct (FFDCA). Similar to the FDA GLP regulations, the FIFRA and TSCA GLPregulations delineate standards for studies designed to determine the healtheffects of a test substance; however, the TSCA GLP standards also containprovisions related to environmental testing (i.e., ecological effects andchemical fate). Compliance with EPA's GLP regulations has been monitored through a programof laboratory inspections and study audits coordinated between EPA andFDA. Under an Interagency Agreement originated in 1978, FDA carries outGLP inspections at laboratories which conduct health effects testing. EPAprimarily performs GLP inspections for environmental laboratories and conductsdata audits for health effects and environmental studies. After a thorough review of its GLP regulations and compliance program,FDA concluded that some of the provisions of the GLPs needed to be clarified,amended, or deleted in order to reduce the regulatory burden on testingfacilities. Accordingly, FDA revised its GLP regulations in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of September 4, 1987 (52 FR 33768). These GLPstandards are intended to simplify the regulations without compromisingstudy integrity. EPA agrees with FDA that many provisions of the GLP regulations can bestreamlined without compromising the goals of the GLP standards. Therefore,EPA is amending the TSCA GLP standards to incorporate many of the changesmade by FDA to its GLP regulations. In addition, EPA is expanding the scopeof the TSCA GLP standards to cover testing wherever it is conducted (e.g.,field testing). Elsewhere in this <T4>Federal Register</T4>, EPA is finalizing similar changes to the FIFRAGLP standards.C. Consistency With FDA GLP Regulations It is EPA's policy to minimize the regulatory burden on the public whichmight arise from conflicting requirements which could be promulgated underdifferent regulatory authorities. In keeping with this policy, the final1983 TSCA GLP standards, 40 CFR part 792, followed the format and, withfew exceptions, the wording of FDA's final GLP regulations, 21 CFR part58. Differences between the EPA and FDA GLP regulations were based uponvarying needs and responsibilities under each Agency's regulatory statutes.This revision to the TSCA GLP standards follows this same policy by conformingto many of the changes FDA made to its GLP regulations, published in the<T4>Federal Register</T4> of September 4, 1987 (52 FR 33768). EPA has variedfrom FDA's revised GLP regulations only when necessary due to EPA's statutoryresponsibilities. The most significant differences between the EPA changesand the revised FDA GLP regulations are the scope of the testing and testsystems affected. As in the 1983 TSCA GLP standards, the revisions to the TSCA GLP standardsvary from the FDA GLP regulations in that the TSCA GLP standards incorporateprovisions for environmental testing (EPA is extending the FIFRA GLP standardsto extend to environmental studies as well). Environmental studies includeecological effects and chemical fate studies. Ecological effects studiesare those performed for development of information on non-human toxicityand potential ecological impact of chemicals and their degradation products.ChemicaI fate studies are studies performed to characterize physical, chemical,and persistence properties of a substance in order to evaluate the transportand transformation of the substance in the environment. To ensure the quality and integrity of all data generated from environmentalstudies, the current TSCA GLP standards contain requirements within 40CFR part 792, subpart L applicable to testing plants, microbial organisms,aquatic organisms, amphibians, reptiles, and birds, where appropriate.These requirements include provisions for care, care facilities, and supplyfacilities for the various test systems used in environmental testing.As a means of simplifying the regulations, EPA is changing the requirementscurrently found within subpart L by merging them into subparts A throughJ of the TSCA GLP standards (40 CFR part 792, subparts A through J). Accordingly,andSection; 792.43 Animal care facilities, andSection; 792.45 Animal supplyfacilities, and andSection; 792.90 Animal care, incorporate the provisionsrelating to the care of test systems, test system care facilities, andtest system supply facilities from andSection; 792.228 in subpart L of the1983 GLP standards. The expanded sections are retitled in the revisionas follows: andSection; 792.43 Test system care facilities, andSection; 792.45Test system supply facilities, and andSection; 792.90 Animal and other testsystem care. Further, in most instances, EPA is replacing the term ``animal,''used in the 1983 EPA and 1978 FDA GLP regulations, with the broader term``test system.'' Specifically, this change occurs in andSection;andSection;792.43, 792.45, 792.81, 792.90, and 792.120. These changes are furtherdiscussed in Unit II of this preamble. EPA's TSCA GLP standards also vary from FDA's in their coverage of testingconducted in the field. To ensure the quality and integrity of data submittedto the Agency, EPA believes that GLP standards must apply whenever datacollection occurs. Because many of the test data required by EPA are developedin the field, or more accurately in outdoor laboratories (ground waterstudies, air monitoring studies, degradation in soil, etc.), EPA is amendingthe GLP standards to include field testing within the scope of these regulations.The remaining differences between the EPA and FDA GLP regulations are describedin the preamble to this final rule and the preamble to the TSCA GLP standards,published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of November 29, 1983 (48 FR 53922). EPA has coordinatedthis final rule with FDA and has considered public comments received onthe December 28, 1987 proposal (52 FR 48933).D.

Summary of Comments and Responses </ITAG>EPA received 14 comment letters: 6 from manufacturers of products regulatedby EPA, 3 from associations, 4 from testing or consulting laboratories,and 1 from another government agency. The majority of the comments supportedthe proposed changes, although numerous suggestions were made for additionalrevisions to parts of the GLP regulations not subject to this rulemakingor modifications to the proposed changes. Comments that raised importantpolicy questions, suggested modification to the essence of the proposedregulation, or required an individual response, are discussed below. Commentsaddressing changes to the GLP standards that were not proposed are notthe subject of this rulemaking. However, all comments made have been placedin the public record. A. General Provisions: Definitions 1. <T3>Batch.</T3> The definition of ``batch'' is expanded to include referencesubstances. This was an omission in the proposed rule that is correctedin the final rule to maintain consistency with the use of the term in andSection;792.105(a). 2. <T3>Carrier_</T3>i. <T3>Comment:</T3> The word ``systems'' should replace the word ``organisms''in the definition of ``carrier,'' to be consistent with the term ``testsystem.'' <T3>Response:</T3> EPA concurs with the suggestion. In order to be consistentwith the definition of ``test systems,'' the word is changed accordingly.ii. <T3>Comment:</T3> EPA should revise the list in parentheses that followsthe word ``material'' in the definition of ``carrier'' to make it all inclusive.<T3>Response:</T3> EPA has decided to add the phrase ``including but notlimited to * * *'', to indicate that the list provides examples and isnot meant to be all inclusive. 3. <T3>Control substance_</T3><T3>Comment:</T3> EPA should delete the phrase ``for no-effect levels''in the definition of control substance. The definition as written is toonarrow and excludes analytical chemistry (e.g., chemical fate, residuechemistry) operations where the term ``control'' has a meaning distinctlydifferent from biological effects. <T3>Response:</T3> Since the purpose of the analytical control is to eventuallyestablish that none of the materials administered to the test system interferewith identification of the test substance and its degradate(s) and metabolite(s),EPA agrees that the terminology is too limiting and is replacing the phrase``for no-effect levels'' with the phrase ``for known chemical or biologicalmeasurements.'' The definition now reads: ``Control substance means anychemical substance or mixture, or any other material other than a testsubstance, feed, or water, that is administered to the test system in thecourse of a study for the purpose of establishing a basis for comparisonwith the test substance for known chemical or biological measurements.''4. <T3>Experimental start and termination dates_</T3><T3>Comment:</T3> These dates would be difficult to predict, especiallyfor field studies, because they would be subject to natural or man-madeconditions that cannot be controlled or anticipated. Since the dates wouldbe subject to change, many protocol amendments would be required, creatingan undue administrative burden. <T3>Response:</T3> The experimental start and termination dates specifiedin the protocol are merely proposed dates. Therefore if the actual experimentalstart or termination date is different from the proposed dates no protocolamendment would be required. 5. <T3>Reference substance_</T3><T3>Comment:</T3> If EPA intended the term ``reference substance'' to includeanalytical and calibration standards, then several other sections of theproposed rule which mention ``reference substance,'' would also requirethe same types of records to be kept for analytical standards. This wouldconstitute an excessive burden on management which would require maintainingvarious records that do not add any value to the study. <T3>Response:</T3> The definition of reference substance is intended toinclude analytical reference standards. Therefore, EPA believes this changeeliminates any ambiguity in the definition. EPA has modified the definitionof ``reference substance,'' as follows: ``Reference substance means anychemical substance or mixture, analytical reference standard, or materialother than a test substance, feed, or water, that is administered to orused in analyzing the test system in the course of a study for purposesof establishing a basis for comparison with the test substance for knownchemical or biological measurements.'' EPA disagrees that inclusion of analytical reference standards in thispart constitutes an excessive documentation burden or adds no value tothe study. Documentation which supports defining of analytical referencestandards under this part should not require excess paperwork since commonlaboratory practices already require assurance of the validity of standardsto make certain that the measurements are accurate. 6. <T3>Study_</T3>i. <T3>Comment:</T3> The proposed definition of study would imply that eachdetermination such as stability, solubility, octanol water partition coefficient,volatility, persistence, and other data point determinations would be studieswith concomitant requirements such as protocols and quality assurance unit(QAU) inspections. <T3>Response:</T3> EPA intends that QAU inspections as listed in andSection;792.35 be conducted at intervals adequate to ensure the integrity of thestudy for each determination such as stability, solubility, octanol waterpartition coefficient, volatility, persistence, and other data point determinations.However, if done as part of a larger study, then these determinations arecovered under the larger study's protocol or standard operating procedure(SOP). If they are submitted to EPA as a study unto itself, then they requiretheir own protocol(s). ii. <T3>Comment: </T3>An experiment such as product chemistry which does notinvolve a test system cannot be considered a ``study'' and therefore shouldnot be covered by GLP standards.<T3>Response: </T3>Studies designed to determine the physical or chemicalcharacteristics of a test substance are included within the scope of theseregulations. Therefore, EPA intends to include product chemistry experimentsin the definition of ``study.'' This change is consistent with the definitionof the term ``study'' as it now appears, and as it appears in the FIFRAGLP standards at 40 CFR part 160. In the case of product chemistry experiments,the test substance itself may be the test system.iii. <T3>Comment: </T3>The addition of the term ``or in the environment'' tothe definition of ``study'' indicates that the change extends the proposedregulations to field studies. While it is necessary to ensure the validityof all data collected, the variety and special requirements of field researchhave not been addressed in the new rules.<T3>Response: </T3>These regulations are intended to apply to all studiesrequired to be submitted under TSCA, including those conducted in the field.EPA recognizes that field studies vary and have special requirements, butbelieves that the development of protocols and SOPs by the testing facilityprovides adequate flexibility in this respect.iv. <T3>Comment: </T3>``Prospectively'' should not be deleted from the definitionof ``study.'' If the essence of GLP standards requires a carefully plannedstudy and the proposed rule is very strict about documentation that mustbe completed prior to the experimental start date, how can the GLP standardsalso apply to studies that were generated without a protocol or advanceplanning, such as epidemiology?<T3>Response: </T3>EPA disagrees with the comment. The term prospectivelyis deleted because EPA wishes all studies, including epidemiological studieswhere past exposure to a study population is determined or estimated retrospectively,to be performed under GLP standards. EPA recognizes that in such studiesdata used may not have been generated in conformance with FIFRA GLP standards.However, it is EPA's position that the study itself can be conducted andsubmitted to EPA in accordance with the GLP standards. Retrospective aspectsof such studies that are not performed according to GLP standards, forexample, test system treatment, should be identified in the compliancestatement submitted with the study report.In addition, the types of studies potentially not covered by these regulationswere expanded in the definition to include experiments involving test methods.7. <T3>Test system_Comment: </T3>What constitutes the ``test system'' in testsof product chemistry studies?<T3>Response: </T3>The definition of ``test system'' includes the statementthat it is ``* * * any * * * chemical or physical matrix * * *,'' includingsubparts thereof that are treated with the test, control, or referencesubstance and also appropriate components of the system that are not treated.Therefore, in the case of product chemistry, the test system may be thetest substance itself.EPA is including the term ``reference,'' which was inadvertently omittedfrom the definition as it appeared in the proposed rule, in order to remainconsistent. In addition, EPA is replacing ``e.g.'' in the parentheticalby adding ``including but not limited to'' in order to clarify that itis not EPA's intent for the list to be all encompassing.8. <T3>Vehicle_Comment: </T3>The definition of ``vehicle'' serves to clarifythe GLP standards, but there has been no confusion based on the currentstandards and this change is contrary to EPA's stated objective of beingconsistent with FDA's GLP regulations.<T3>Response: </T3>EPA believes that clarification is needed. The EPA GLPstandards cover a larger number of types of studies and the need for clarificationof the meaning of potentially ambiguous terms is greater.B. Organization and Personnel1. <T3>Testing Facility Management_</T3><T3>Comment: </T3>The ``master schedule'' should not be considered ``rawdata'' as was indicated in the preamble (52 FR 48936) to the proposed rule.<T3>Response: </T3>EPA deleted the requirement that the replacement ofa study director must be documented as ``raw data'' in order to conformto the revised FDA GLP regulations. This is because replacement of thestudy director must be reflected on the master schedule sheet, which isa study record that must be retained.In addition, the term ``reference,'' which was inadvertently omitted inthe proposed rule, has been added to this section.2. <T3>Quality Assurance Unit_</T3>i. <T3>Comment: </T3>A QAU that is entirely separate from and independentof the personnel engaged in the conduct of the study creates an unjustifiedfinancial burden on some facilities. In some cases it would be impossibleto establish a completely independent QAU with qualified personnel.<T3>Response: </T3>As stated in the proposed rule (52 FR 48933), EPA doesnot require the QAU to be a fixed, permanently staffed unit whose onlyfunctions are to monitor the quality of a study. EPA is only concernedthat there be a distinct separation of duties between those personnel involvedwith the conduct or direction of a study and those personnel performingquality assurance on the same study. Therefore, andSection; 792.35(a) prohibitspersonnel from performing quality assurance activities on their own study.The rules allow a study director for a particular study to serve as a partof the QAU or as the QAU for a different study. FDA noted (52 FR 33771)that it was aware that many small laboratories could not afford the operationof a permanently staffed QAU. EPA would like to point out that in thosesituations where there are different individuals performing the qualityassurance functions for different studies, each individual is requiredto maintain that portion of the master schedule sheet which relates tothe study being monitored. For this reason, EPA agrees with FDA's conclusionthat the separation of functions on a study-by-study basis, as permittedin the existing and revised regulations, would provide effective qualityassurance. In view of the potential gain to management, to sponsors, andto EPA, through the added assurance of well-conducted studies, the increasedcosts are thereby justified. EPA believes that its intent is more clearlyindicated by the changes now being made.ii. <T3>Comment: </T3>Laboratory management should have the discretion to determinewho enters the data into the master schedule, as long as the required informationis listed.<T3>Response: </T3>EPA believes that management retains such discretionsince it is involved in determining the composition of the QAU and it providesan adequate number of such personnel (andSection;andSection; 792.31 (c) and(e)). The QAU is distinguished by training that ensures that QAU functionsare properly conducted. As stated above, study personnel may belong tothe QAU, as long as they are not performing the QAU functions associatedwith studies in which they are involved.iii. <T3>Comment: </T3>The requirement for inspection of each study under andSection;792.35(b)(3), regardless of duration, is excessive for the quality assuranceneeded to address study integrity, especially where studies are performedby highly standardized procedures. The repetitive inspection of these typesof studies would consume large amounts of time for both the study personneland QAU staff. Auditing each study is not necessary to ensure the workis conducted in compliance with the regulations. Random sampling proceduresshould be allowed in selecting studies and phases of studies to inspectto decrease the work load and resource requirements of the QAU. <T3>Response: </T3>EPA does not believe that a random inspection programwould be an appropriate method of evaluating a study. Generally, randomsampling provides an adequate means of quality control where analysis involvesrepetition or identical procedures. However, any assumption that the conductof one phase of one study would be representative of another would be invalidatedby the differences among study personnel and the operations they conduct.Furthermore, this requirement does not apply to all routine studies. Section792.35(b) is among the exclusions for chemical and physical characterizationstudies as listed in andSection; 792.135(b). In conformance with the revised FDA GLP regulations (52 FR 33780), EPAmodified the requirements of andSection; 792.35(b)(3) to provide for inspectionsof a study on a schedule adequate to ensure the integrity of the study.The changes to this section will allow the QAU the necessary latitude toadjust its monitoring activities to meet the individual problems of eachstudy. However, each study, no matter how short, must be inspected at leastonce while in progress. EPA expects that by allowing the QAU flexibilityin designing a reasonable inspection schedule, the goal of ensuring thequality of the study can be best achieved. iv. <T3>Comment: </T3>EPA indicates in the preamble to the proposed rule (andSection;792.35(e), 52 FR 48936) that all QAU records will now be routinely availableto inspectors. Existing GLP standards treat certain QAU records as confidential,and explicitly state that the only QAU records to be reviewed by EPA auditorswould be the master schedule (e.g., the inspection dates, study inspected,the phase or segment of the study inspected, and the name of the individualperforming the inspection). If QAU records for findings and correctiveaction are available on an auditor's request, QAUs would lose their effectiveness.<T3>Response: </T3>EPA shares the concerns of the commenters that accessto all parts of a QAU inspection would weaken the inspection system, andrecognizes the need to maintain a degree of confidentiality. Therefore,records of findings and problems, as well as records of corrective actionrecommended and taken, are exempt from routine EPA inspections, exceptunder special circumstances as indicated in andSection; 792.15. However,EPA maintains that all other reports and records must be easily accessibleand made available to EPA and FDA inspectors when requested as indicatedin andSection; 792.35(c). C. Facilities 1. <T3>General_Comment: </T3>Outdoor testing facilities should not be underGLP standards since: (a) Outdoor test facilities will be conducting studiesaccording to approved protocols; (b) ensuring suitability is highly subjectivebased on the diverse number of possible locations; (c) there is a concomitantlack of clear standards for determining suitability of locations. Despite best efforts, the choice could always be subject to criticism andeven criminal liability based on a good faith compliance statement indicatingGLP standards had been followed. Most outdoor testing is done to mimicnormal environmental conditions which are specific for the test substanceand use being proposed. Therefore, the determination of whether the size,construction or location of a facility is suitable for a study is a technicalissue, and is not within the scope of the GLP regulation and would be consideredin the experimental design of the protocol. <T3>Response: </T3>In cases where an EPA-approved protocol establishestest locations, that protocol would satisfy GLP requirements. EPA considersany site to be the testing facility wherever testing is undertaken to generatedata required to be submitted to EPA. The conditions required by the protocolare not necessarily conducive to artificial manipulation in the field,or to other outdoor testing facilities. Therefore, ensuring the suitabilityof the location of these types of testing facilities is both a valid andnecessary part of protocols approved by EPA. 2. <T3>Test system care facilities. </T3>i. <T3>Comment: </T3>Instead of expanding the original document to fit alltest systems, the old rules should be left as is, and a statement addedto cover non-animal test systems. <T3>Response: </T3>EPA disagrees with the comment and believes that specificchanges of the old rule are necessary to avoid ambiguity concerning themeaning of non-animal test systems. ii. <T3>Comment: </T3>Section 792.43(a)(2) and (b), (e), (f), (g), and (h)should be deleted because EPA has already stated that these GLP requirementswill be applicable to all types of testing. It is not necessary to addthe four new paragraphs detailing specific requirements of environmentalconditions for aquatic organisms and plants. <T3>Response: </T3>EPA believes that some test systems, e.g., aquatic,are unique to the extent that they require special treatment in the rules.iii. <T3>Comment: </T3>The change in andSection; 792.43(c) is appropriate butthe current wording does not require separate disease handling facilitiesin every case. The proposed change has merit in clarifying the optionsavailable to laboratories and the change promotes harmony between EPA andFDA GLP regulations. <T3>Response: </T3>EPA agrees with the comment. In andSection; 792.43(c),EPA is deleting the requirement that separate areas be provided in allcases for the diagnosis, treatment, and control of test system diseases.Instead, a change is made so that separate areas are provided ``as appropriate.''This change is consistent with the September 4, 1987 revised FDA GLP regulationsand the revised FIFRA GLP regulations. EPA has made this change to allow laboratories the option of disposingof diseased test systems without also bearing the expense of maintainingseparate areas in testing facilities for diagnosis, treatment, and controlof disease. Additionally, EPA recognizes that the diagnosis and treatmentrequirements of andSection; 792.43(c) may not be appropriate when dealingwith such test systems as soil, plants, or microorganisms. However, ifthe decision is made not to dispose of the test system, then test systemcare facilities, as specified in andSection; 792.43(c), must be provided.3. <T3>Test system supply facilities. </T3>i. <T3>Comment: </T3>The addition of the two new paragraphs outlining plantand aquatic facilities to andSection; 792.45(b) is unnecessary. These considerationsare addressed in andSection; 792.41 with the requirement that testing facilitiesbe of suitable construction ``to facilitate proper conduct of studies.''<T3>Response: </T3>EPA maintains that testing facilities as mentioned inandSection; 792.41 and test system supply facilities as mentioned in andSection;792.45, are not the same and must be addressed separately.ii. <T3>Comment: </T3>EPA should delete andSection; 792.45(b) introductory text,(b)(1), (b)(2), and (c) because this information was adequately coveredin andSection; 792.45(a) and in andSection; 792.43, and the facilities theyrefer to will be addressed in study protocol. <T3>Response: </T3>EPA maintains that andSection; 792.43 (test system care)is different from andSection; 792.45 (test system supply) and must thereforebe treated separately.4. <T3>Facilities for handling test, control, and reference substances_Comment:</T3>Would it be necessary to provide separate sink facilities or separaterooms for mixing of the test, control, and reference substances or foradding water to tank sprayers? <T3>Response:</T3> Separate areas are required for receipt, mixing andstorage of test, control, and reference substances and their mixtures asnecessary to prevent contamination or mixups. The same sink could be usedfor all work involving mixing provided that the procedures (standard operatingprocedures) used are adequate to prevent contamination and mixups. Separateareas for receipt and storage, mixing and storage of test, control, andreference substances as required in andSection; 792.47(a) (1), (2) and (3)does not mandate the use of separate rooms. The areas could be in the sameroom provided there is adequate space and equipment to provide that contaminationand mixup do not occur. This determination should be made on a case-by-casebasis. D. Equipment <T3>Maintenance and calibration of equipment_Comment:</T3> It is betterto designate in andSection; 792.63(b) that repair and maintenance will beperformed by ``qualified personnel,'' than to require that a person bedesignated in the written SOP. The requirement for written SOPs in andSection;792.63(b) causes problems since at many laboratories the equipment usedin conducting a study is shared by a number of individuals and the careand maintenance of the equipment is also shared. In the event of equipmentfailure, a number of laboratory personnel may be capable of effecting repairor correcting a problem, or in more serious equipment failures, a servicerepresentative of the manufacturer may be called. It is therefore difficultand very inefficient to designate specific people to perform each specificmaintenance and repair operation. <T3>Response:</T3> The definition of ``person'' as it appears in andSection;792.3(h) is not limited to an individual scientist or technician, but includesan organizational subunit. Consequently, the SOP that designates the ``personresponsible'' will be designating a subunit of the testing facility, whichcould be one or several individuals. This view is consistent with FDA's(52 FR 33774) interpretation and definition of ``person.'' Where dutiesare delegated in the SOPs all contingencies may be addressed, includingthe contracting of service personnel. E. Testing Facilities Operation 1. <T3>Standard operating procedures_</T3>i. <T3>Comment:</T3> Some of the examples of required SOPs provided in andSection;792.81(b) are not applicable to all test systems or study types. For example,``test room preparation'' would not be appropriate when conducting fieldstudies, and ``necropsy of test system or postmortem examination of testsystems,'' would not apply to studies using a chemical or physical matrixas the test system (sterile water, soil, agricultural fields). Furthermore,andSection; 792.81(c) states that, ``Each laboratory or other study areashall have immediately available manuals and SOPs relative to the laboratoryor field procedures being performed.'' <T3>Response:</T3> EPA agrees that the term ``room'' in andSection; 792.81(b)(1)is inappropriate to many studies and is changing the word to ``area'' toclarify that field studies are included. EPA believes that andSection; 792.81(b)should apply in all cases since the purpose of SOPs is to insure the qualityand integrity of the data generated in the course of a study as statedin andSection; 792.81(a). However, procedures that are not performed, suchas necropsy in the case of field studies, do not require SOPs. ii. <T3>Comment:</T3> Published literature (e.g., ASTM methods) should be acceptablein andSection; 792.81(c) as an appropriate part of an SOP and not just asa supplement to a written SOP. The written SOP could incorporate the publishedliterature into it by reference, without having to rewrite the entire procedure.<T3>Response: </T3>EPA agrees that it would not be appropriate to rewritepublished literature, hence the allowance for SOPs to use them as supplements.The SOPs are still needed to establish the relationship of the method todata collection procedures and needs in the laboratory. While the resultingSOP would still have to be written it would in effect be abbreviated inthat all of the methodology referenced would not need to be rewritten.2. <T3>Animal and other test system care_</T3>i. <T3>Comment:</T3> The evaluation of certain test systems according to ``acceptable* * * scientific practice'' creates some difficulty, particularly for plants,microorganisms, soil, and water, since such practices are not defined.``Acceptable'' should be deleted regarding scientific practice and therequirement be only that a scientific basis be used in determining appropriatenessfor testing. In this way, testing facilities would not need to justifyor prove their basis to be ``acceptable'' in ill-defined areas or thosein flux. <T3>Response:</T3> EPA agrees that the term ``acceptable scientific practice''may not be definable when method developments are in flux. The term ``acceptable''is retained, but the term ``scientific practice'' is changed to ``scientificmethods.'' This change preserves the EPA's intent that rigorous scientificmethodology be used without implying that rigid practices be adhered towhere they may not appropriately exist. ii. <T3>Comment:</T3> Section 792.90(c) should be deleted since the effectof corrective treatment cannot be accounted for in test results. <T3>Response:</T3> EPA believes that while the effects of corrective actionstaken to isolate and treat disease or signs of disease may complicate interpretationof test results, so might the effects of the disease itself. This requirementfor field studies is not inconsistent with its inclusion for laboratory,i.e. toxicology, studies. iii. <T3>Comment:</T3> Markings which identify animals individually, ratherthan the group as required by andSection; 792.90(d), are needed in many studieswith warm blooded vertebrates in pens, or in the field. For example, precocialyoung of avian species should be marked individually. <T3>Response:</T3> Specific criteria for marking of individuals to meetstudy requirements should be addressed separately in the protocol of thestudy. The requirement in andSection; 792.90(d) addresses the need that testsystems be adequately identified to prevent confounding with other testsystems. Identification of precocial birds, for example, may be outlinedin the study protocol. iv. <T3>Comment:</T3> The proposed multispecies housing under andSection; 792.90(e)(1)is redundant to proposed andSection; 792.43(a)(1) and is inconsistent withEPA's desire to streamline GLP standards. <T3>Response:</T3> EPA disagrees with the conclusion that these provisionsare redundant. While andSection; 792.43(a)(1) states that the facilitiesshall be sufficient to allow proper separation of species, andSection; 792.90(e)(1)refers specifically to test system care within the facilities.v. <T3>Comment:</T3> The requirement in andSection; 792.90(j) for acclimatizationof plants and animals should be deleted, since it is not defined and promotesconfusion. Animal toxicology tests would be subject to isolation and separatelyto acclimatization. Organisms in environmental studies will have been isolatedwith their health status being evaluated per andSection; 792.90(b) and acclimatizationwould have already been performed as part of the process. This part shouldbe amended to indicate that test organisms should be acclimatized to allexperimental conditions except the test substance. <T3>Response:</T3> EPA believes that the term acclimatization has commonmeaning that is clear in the context of its usage in the rule. Acclimatizationimplies accustoming to experimental, i.e. environmental, conditions otherthan the actual introduction of the effect (e.g. test substance) to bemeasured in the experiment. If acclimatization is achieved during the processof isolation then it should be so stated in the protocol and does not requireadditional technical effort. In addition, the term ``organisms'' in andSection; 792.90(j) has been changedto ``systems.'' This change is consistent with the intended expansion ofGLP standards and was an inadvertent omission in the proposed rule.F. Test, Control, and Reference Substances 1.<T3> Test, control, and reference substance characterization_</T3>  i.<T3>Comment:</T3> The term ``purity'' should be expanded to include radiochemicalpurity since further definition is needed to encompass metabolism/environmentalfate studies conducted with radioactive materials. <T3>Response:</T3> Radiochemical purity is covered under ``other characteristicswhich appropriately define the test, control, or reference substance.''It is not necessary to specifically list this characteristic. ii. <T3>Comment:</T3> What level of analysis constitutes ``appropriate'' characterization?Is quality control batch analysis sufficient? Is it necessary to fullycharacterize technical materials to 0.1 percent? <T3>Response:</T3> The details of what ``appropriately'' defines the testsubstance is a guideline or protocol issue that cannot be specified ina generic document such as GLP standards. The appropriate level of characterizationis largely dependent on the nature and purpose of the study. iii. <T3>Comment:</T3> The characterization requirement is inappropriate sinceit conflicts with management responsibilities, is costly and adds unnecessarydelays to the development process. It removes a necessary option of planningby objectives that responsible business management must retain. Delaysand rescheduling, which may result if inadequate work is permitted by management,are real consequences that must be accepted by management, and managementmust decide whether or not to risk beginning an experiment prior to doingcharacterization studies. Since the ultimate validity of a study will requirethat such data be obtained before the study is completed and as long asthe sponsor can demonstrate that a study was conducted with authentic material,it is irrelevant when the characterization is completed. This proposalis not in concert with FDA GLPs. Many times prospective products fail toreach the marketplace due to unusual or insurmountable problems. Therefore,eliminating the need for characterization of product will reduce the costsof these products that fall out of the developmental process. <T3>Response:</T3> Characterization is necessary to ensure integrity ofstudies. It is also necessary for EPA to have characterization data availablefor inspectional purposes during ongoing studies, and thus to have thisinformation complete at the beginning of the study. Without characterization,it is not possible to know whether test, control, or reference substancesfrom different batches that are used in a single study are in fact identical.Adequate testing for characterization normally occurs during the synthesisor production of test, control, and reference substances, and thus shouldalready be available before the test begins. Consequently, having characterizationdata available should not impose an additional burden in most cases. EPA does agree, however, that stability testing should be allowed to beperformed concurrently with the study, to prevent unreasonable delays.The sponsor will bear the burden of a repeated test in the case that concurrentstability testing suggests that the study is not valid. For that reason,EPA is revising andSection; 792.105(b) to allow for concomitant determinationof stability. iv. <T3>Comment:</T3> The last sentence of andSection; 792.105(a), relating tomethods and fabrication should be deleted since these may contain confidentialbusiness information (CBI). <T3>Response:</T3> This is not a new requirement and has not posed anyproblems. Inspectors are cleared to handle CBI material; any sensitiveinformation can be declared CBI and treated as such. v. <T3>Comment:</T3> Many of the tests coming under the scope of the proposedGLP standards are in themselves stability studies. The proposal placesindustry in the quandary of conducting stability studies prior to a stabilitystudy. <T3>Response: </T3>The performance tests cited cannot be considered tobe stability tests under the GLP standards. In the context described above,the persistence of the substance in the environment is a separately measuredparameter. However, when performing such tests, it is still important toknow the stability of the substance to ensure that the measured effectwas due to the effect of the test system. vi. <T3>Comment:</T3> Would it be acceptable to EPA if the stability knowledgeis based on the extrapolation of the results of a short-term stabilitystudy under extreme conditions carried out before the experimental startingdate? <T3>Response:</T3> Such an accelerated study would not demonstrate stabilityunder test conditions, and could not be part of the concurrent stabilitytesting in conjunction with a larger study. It would be a separate studywith its own protocol. vii. <T3>Comment:</T3> The proposed rule does not address whether quality controlactivities fall under the GLP standards. <T3>Response:</T3> Not all quality control activities are GLP issues. Qualitycontrol work that is integral to the laboratory performing the study wouldbe under GLP standards, but not that performed during manufacturing. Studies,as defined in this part, are subject to GLP standards only when requiredto be submitted to fulfill data requirements. viii. <T3>Comment:</T3> The part related to ``storage container assignment forthe duration of a study'' in andSection; 792.105(c) would be unrealisticfor field studies, especially where storage containers may be large tanks,or delivery systems which are possibly not even owned by the sponsor ortesting facility. <T3>Response:</T3> The delivery systems and tanks that are part of deliverysystems are not ``storage containers.'' Test, control, and reference substanceswill, however, be stored before use in some container that is unique tothat substance during the test. This may be the container that the substancecomes in or that is assigned to it by the testing facility. ix. <T3>Comment:</T3> Liquids from large containers are often placed into smallercontainers for use during the study. Consolidation of the test substanceinto smaller containers as the supply is depleted should be allowed. Thesecontainers need not be retained after they are empty, since their retentiondoes not enhance the quality or integrity of the data collected. <T3>Response:</T3> EPA disagrees with the suggestion. The retention ofcontainers is necessary to ensure the integrity of the study. This includesempty containers, which must be kept to verify the disposition of the test,control, and reference substance. Disposal of containers adversely affectsaccountability. This provision of the rule is not changed from the 1983rule, but was commented on by the public because it may affect types ofstudies, such as field studies, that will now fall under the provisionsof the rule as a result of these amendments.x. <T3>Comment: </T3>How are ``studies of more than 4 weeks duration'' specifiedin andSection; 792.105(d) defined? They should be defined as studies havingan ``in-life phase'' of more than 4 weeks. <T3>Response: </T3>The term ``4 weeks duration'' is meant to apply to theexperimental start and experimental termination dates. The suggestion ofusing the term ``in-life phase'' is not accepted since this introducesnew terminology that is not adequately defined. The term ``4 weeks experimentalduration'' replaces ``4 weeks duration'' in andSection; 792.105(d) to clarifythat the study initiation and study completion dates are not implied. xi. <T3>Comment: </T3>Knowledge of stability makes sense for long-term, butnot short-term studies because if stability is suspect then doses are madeup each day and given or sprayed immediately. Adequate knowledge of stabilitymay exist from chemical information about the test substance. <T3>Response: </T3>If a substance is known to be stable for a few days,then its stability is known in terms of the test requirements. If the stabilityis not known then it must be determined, even for short studies. Storagestability needs to be known even if the material is used ``immediately''.If enough information is known about the material to support its stabilityfrom other testing then its stability is known and the requirement is met.However, theoretical stability is not considered to be adequate. The methodused to compensate for poor stability, such as daily mixing or immediateapplication, is a technical issue that cannot be specifically prescribedin GLP standards. 2. <T3>Test, control, and reference substance handling_Comment: </T3>If thetest, control, or reference substance is inherently unstable, it may notbe possible to ``preclude deterioration * * *''. Therefore, the regulationshould allow for periodic evaluation of the purity of the test substanceduring a study to assure its integrity and replace it when shown to bewarranted. <T3>Response: </T3>The intent is to prevent deterioration due to handling.Periodic testing is allowed under andSection; 792.105(b) as changed in thefinal rule. 3. <T3>Mixtures of substances with carriers_</T3>i. <T3>Comment: </T3>Does andSection; 792.113 require determination of uniformity,stability, and solubility during field residue studies? If so, does itrequire analyses for each tank preparation? This requirement would imposea large burden on testing facilities performing these types of studies.<T3>Response: </T3>The purpose of this section is to assure that the methodologyused to prepare the mixture is valid. Once the methodology has been provenfor a particular mixture, it need not be reconfirmed each time that mixtureis prepared. For field trials, there will likely already be data submittedto EPA that support the uniformity, stability and solubility of a substancein the carrier when prepared by appropriate methodology, i.e. accordingto the proposed use or label. In such cases it should not be necessaryto test each batch that is prepared for field application. However, fieldtrials do remain subject to the requirements of this section. Where availabledata are inadequate to support uniformity, stability, and solubility ina particular case, then it is necessary for the data to be generated underthis section. Also, there may be protocol stipulations applicable to aparticular study that require tank mixture analyses in addition to anyprovisions of this section. ii. <T3>Comment: </T3>The range of environmental conditions encountered infield trials are great and would require extensive evaluations of stabilityand solubility under numerous environmental conditions. This amount ofdata could not be evaluated prior to study initiation. <T3>Response: </T3>Section 792.113(a)(2) states that the determination(s)shall be ``* * * under the environmental conditions specified in the protocoland as required by the conditions of the test.'' All possible environmentalconditions do not have to be anticipated and tested unless required inthe protocol. iii. <T3>Comment: </T3>Short-term toxicity and field residue studies shouldbe exempted from this section since supplementary analyses are performedfor other studies with the same test substance. The analytical cost couldequal or exceed the cost of the remainder of the short-term study. <T3>Response: </T3>The GLP standards do not require characterization foreach study. The characterization is required for each test, control, andreference substance. The same substance may need to be characterized onlyonce, even if used on multiple studies. iv. <T3>Comment: </T3>The requirement for stability and solubility should allowflexibility for the sponsor to make the determination either before, during,or after the study. When to determine the stability is a business decisionbased on knowledge of the risk of having to repeat a study, if the stabilitydata negatively impacts the integrity of the study. <T3>Response: </T3>EPA understands that requiring stability testing tobe completed prior to a study may introduce unreasonable delays. In harmonywith the modification of andSection; 792.105(b) to allow concurrent stabilitytesting of test, control, and reference substances, andSection; 792.113(a)(2)is changed to allow stability testing of mixtures to be performed concomitantlywith the study. This allows flexibility and is consistent with FDA's GLPregulations. v. <T3>Comment: </T3>In the very early stage of a compound's development thereis a need for basic acute toxicity tests. However, there are no analyticalmethods and calibrated reference standards available to test the stabilityof the test substance in the carrier according to GLP standards. An estimateof the stability of the compound in an inert carrier like starch, oil,or polyethylene glycol is possible and should be sufficient as a preliminaryapproach. The stability test will be carried out as early as the analyticalmethods are available. <T3>Response: </T3>If a carrier is used, the mixture with the carrier mustgo through the same test, i.e. stability, solubility, etc. Instabilityof the mixture in a specific carrier is important since it may affect theapparent effects of the test substance. vi. <T3>Comment: </T3>The assurances called for in andSection; 792.113(c) arenot well defined. How would the addition of the vehicle used to facilitatemixing of the test substance with the carrier to the control system affectthis requirement? If the vehicle is identically mixed in control, is therea need to show noninterference? <T3>Response: </T3>Any vehicle used to facilitate mixing must be shownnot to interfere with the study. This includes a vehicle control to determineinteraction effect. G. Protocol for and Conduct of a Study 1. <T3>Protocol_General_</T3>i. <T3>Comment: </T3>Section 792.120(a) (5), (7), (10), and (11) should notapply to product chemistry experiments. <T3>Response: </T3>The term ``test system'' is redefined to include anyphysical matrix, which may thus be applicable to product chemistry studies.However, note that a study designed solely for the determination of certainchemical or physical characteristics of a test substance are exempted fromandSection; 792.120(a) (5), (7), (10), and (11) as described in andSection;792.135. In addition, the word ``of'' prior to ``frequency'' should be ``and''.This was a typographical error noticed by one commenter and has been correctedin the final rule. ii. <T3>Comment: </T3>Guidance is needed in the final preamble for presentingaddresses, as required by andSection; 792.120(a)(3), of field and environmentallocations used to conduct tests. <T3>Response: </T3>The address of the testing facility is the address ofthe ``person'' (i.e. organizational unit or subunit) who actually conductsthe study. Even if this organizational unit includes parts situated indifferent locations it may still be considered to have one address. Theaddress should be a permanent address and would probably be synonymouswith the address of the study director and/or testing facility's management.iii. <T3>Comment: </T3>``Address of sponsor'' should be removed from this partto maintain consistency with FDA GLP regulations. <T3>Response: </T3>EPA maintains that the address of the sponsor is essentialto its inspectional process, which differs from that of FDA. iv. <T3>Comment: </T3>The requirement in andSection; 792.120(a)(4) to state theproposed experimental start and termination dates poses problems for fieldstudies where these dates cannot be predicted with certainty. Would thisresult in protocol deviations whenever these dates are not exactly met?<T3>Response:</T3> The requirement to document the proposed experimentalstart and termination date in the protocol does not suggest that a protocoldeviation occurs when the date is not met. The term ``proposed'' signifiesthat this date is estimated. However, gross deviation from the proposeddate may be a violation of the protocol, if there are date-critical aspectsof the study that are identified as such. v. <T3>Comment:</T3> Section 792.120(a)(5) is inappropriate because: (a) Justificationshould be required only when more than one test system can be used in astudy; (b) where standard test systems are used, justification should notbe required; (c) justification should only be required for those that deviatefrom, or fall outside the test standards; (d) this requirement does notpromote harmony between the EPA and FDA GLPs. <T3>Response:</T3> Environmental studies are more diverse than health effectstesting and are subject to details relevant to test system design thatare more chemically dependent than is the case in health effects studies.Furthermore, andSection; 792.120(a)(5) is not seen to impose a burden inthe cases described in this comment. In the case where only one test systemcan be used, that is a justification that should be stated. If a standardtest system is used because it is the referenced system in EPA or Organizationfor Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) guidelines, then citingthe use of such guidelines is sufficient justification. Thus, detaileddiscussions are required only in the relatively few cases where the studydesign requires deviation or special choices to be made in selection ofthe test system. vi. <T3>Comment:</T3> EPA should add ``range'' to andSection; 792.120(a)(6) soit reads ``* * * body weight range,'' since without specifying range, theprotocol requirement could be misinterpreted to mean that all individualbody weights of the test system should be included. This would not be possiblesince exact weights of test systems would not be known when the protocolis prepared. <T3>Response:</T3> EPA did not intend to make a change here and retainsthe term ``body weight range'' as used in the 1983 rule. vii. <T3>Comment:</T3> Section 792.120(a)(10) should be modified to read ``** * route of administration and/or exposure * * *'' to encompass othertypes of protocols. <T3>Response:</T3> EPA disagrees with the suggestion since the experimentercontrols administration but does not have control of the route of exposure.Administration routes cover the potential of all exposure routes and henceis a more general, all-inclusive term. viii. <T3>Comment:</T3> Section 792.120(a)(10) should be reworded so that itreads: ``The route or method of administration/ application and the reasonfor choice, if appropriate.'' <T3>Response:</T3> EPA disagrees with the suggestion. The route of administrationis not the same concept as method of application or administration. Itwould not be appropriate to introduce statements concerning methodologyinto this section. 2. <T3>Physical and chemical characterization studies</T3>_i. <T3>Comment:</T3> Section 792.135 is confusing and needs to be read severaltimes in order to understand it. EPA should clarify its intent by specifyingthose studies to be conducted under GLP standards, and by removing thedouble negatives currently presented in andSection; 792.135 (a) and (b).<T3>Response:</T3> EPA agrees with the comment. The section is changedto eliminate the double negative and reworded for clarity while retainingthe intent of the proposed changes. ii. <T3>Comment:</T3> Should exemptions also apply to ``assembly line'' biologicalstudies, such as the Ames test, acute lethality, eye irritation, etc.?<T3>Response:</T3> EPA does not intend to expand exemptions to biologicaltests previously covered by GLP standards, even where they are repetitivein nature. Section 792.135 applies only to physical and chemical characterizationstudies and is intended to ease the burden on many studies that will nowcome under GLP standards. iii. <T3>Comment:</T3> The concept of what constitutes a study is blurred bythis section. Partial deletion of protocol requirements implies that aprotocol is still required for these ``exempted measurements.'' <T3>Response:</T3> EPA intends that a protocol still be required for thepartially exempted studies. Some, but not all, of the full protocol requirementsare eliminated. iv. <T3>Comment:</T3> Areas for receipt and storage of test substances havebeen deleted in andSection; 792.47(a)(1), but corresponding SOPs are stillrequired by andSection; 792.81(b)(3). <T3>Response:</T3> EPA maintains that SOPs for test, control, and referencesubstance handling are still important, if not more important, when facilitiesfor their handling are not specified. v. <T3>Comment:</T3> Stability is to be known under conditions of the testunder andSection; 792.105(e), but the requirement to report that informationis deleted in andSection; 792.185(a)(5), and the requirement to determinestability is removed by deleting andSection; 792.105(b). <T3>Response:</T3> EPA agrees, but there is no contradiction. The requirementsfor determination and reporting of stability are relaxed although stabilitystill needs to be known. vi. <T3>Comment:</T3> A protocol is required even though certain specific elementshave been deleted (andSection; 792.120(a) (5) through (12) and (15)), butthe requirement for the quality assurance unit to retain the protocol isdeleted (andSection; 792.195(d)). <T3>Response:</T3> EPA agrees that this is true. The QAU record-keepingrequirements are relaxed although the protocol still needs to be written.vii. <T3>Comment:</T3> A quality assurance unit is required by andSection; 792.35(a),but by deleting andSection; 792.31(c) management will not have to assurethe existence of a QAU. <T3>Response:</T3> EPA eliminated andSection; 792.31(c) since it requiresmanagement to ``assure that there is a quality assurance unit as describedin andSection; 792.35.'' This would have contradicted the exclusion of certainportions of andSection; 792.35 as specified (i.e., andSection; 792.35 (b) and(c)). That which is not excluded under andSection; 792.35 must comply withandSection; 792.35(a). viii. <T3>Comment:</T3> A study director is required according to andSection;andSection;792.12 and 792.33, but does not have to be shown in the final report bydeletion of andSection; 792.185(a)(10). <T3>Response:</T3> The study director is still required to sign the compliancestatement submitted with the final report as required in andSection; 792.12and is thus required to be named in the final report. A number of individualsare listed in andSection; 792.185(a)(10) in addition to the study director.This section was exempted to reduce reporting requirements. ix. <T3>Comment:</T3> Studies designed to determine octanol water partitioncoefficient, volatility, and environmental persistence (biodegradation,photodegradation, or chemical degradation studies) should exclude andSection;andSection;792.43 (a)(1) through (c) and (f) through (h), 792.45, 792.81(b) (1), (2),(6), (7), and (9), and 792.90. Only the physical and chemical propertiesthat are used to predict the environmental fate of a test substance shouldbe developed in compliance with these regulations. Those properties whichare not c!early used for this purpose should be excluded. <T3>Response:</T3> EPA does not agree that the listed sections are irrelevantin their entirety to the listed studies. Those portions of the sectionswhich are plainly not applicable to these studies (e.g., animal care facilities)do not place any burden on these studies. x. <T3>Comment:</T3> The removal of physical and chemical characterizationfrom the responsibilities of the QAU should not be accepted because itpresents a major problem for the QAU personnel. The QAU should be responsiblefor every study within the laboratory with no exception. <T3>Response:</T3> EPA disagrees with the conclusion that the OAU has noresponsibilities in physical and chemical characterization studies. Theexclusions reduce the responsibilities of the QAU, i.e., master schedulerequirements, etc., but do not eliminate them. xi. <T3>Comment:</T3> The QAU should be responsible for looking at the functionalcomponents of the laboratory (e.g., all melting points, all GC/MS analyses,etc.) rather than focusing on a particular study, such as with toxicologystudies. <T3>Response:</T3> EPA agrees and is modifying the inspectional requirementsof the QAU under andSection; 792.35. This change specifies that the QAU conductinspections and maintain records that are appropriate to particular studies.This gives latitude to the QAU with respect to how the information is gathered;i.e., as part of the standard review procedures of the laboratory, or asneeded for the test. This change should reduce burden in cases where itis appropriate to maintain central records regarding functional componentsthat affect several studies rather than requiring such records to be maintainedseparately.H. Records and Reports 1. <T3>Storage and retrieval of records and data_</T3>i. <T3>Comment:</T3> The phrase ``beyond quality assurance'' in andSection;792.190(a) needs clarification since it could be ambiguously interpreted.Does it mean the date of the final approved report? Does it mean beyondinitial evaluation of the specimens, since that was the statement usedin the corresponding preamble section? <T3>Response:</T3> EPA intends that the specimens be retained until QAUassures that their discarding does not negatively impact the integrityof the study. The wording is being changed to ``after quality assuranceverification'' to clarify this intent. ii. <T3>Comment:</T3> Tissues and animal feeds collected from non-toxicologystudies should also be discarded after quality assurance verification.If EPA does not intend for animal tissues to be retained from residue studiesthen ``animal'' not appearing after ``plants'' is an oversight. <T3>Response:</T3> EPA did not include the term ``animal'' in the listsince it would potentially include tissues and feeds from toxicology studieswhich must be kept under the GLP standards. The suggested wording wouldnot provide sufficient breadth to cover non-residue samples. ThereforeEPA will require that all animal tissue samples, even from non-toxicologystudies, be included in this section. iii. <T3>Comment:</T3> Retention time for \14\C-labelled specimens needs tobe addressed since a facilities license limit could be exceeded for storingradioactive material. <T3>Response:</T3> The problem of licensing requirements is a facilityresponsibility under GLP standards. EPA does not agree that special considerationbe given to sample storage based on this reasoning. 2. <T3>Retention of records_</T3>i. <T3>Comment:</T3> The appropriate endpoint for specimen retention in andSection;792.195 should be based on the integrity of the specimens and use by thestudy director, or other technical personnel, not based on when QAU personnelmay perform a review. <T3>Response:</T3> Quality assurance evaluation is needed to assure thatthe integrity of the data is not compromised by the decision not to retainspecimens. For consistency, EPA is changing the wording of andSection; 792.195(c)to concur with the wording of andSection; 792.190(a). ii. <T3>Comment:</T3> EPA should explicitly state in andSection; 792.195(i) thatwhen exact copies are substituted for original source as raw data, thenthe original may be discarded. In the past EPA inspectors have requiredretention of original data sources even if exact copies existed. The burdenimposed by some EPA auditors, that each copy must be signed and dated,is unrealistic. Verification of ``batches'' of reproduction copies is justas meaningful and would eliminate most of the unnecessary burden on personneland time resources. <T3>Response: </T3>Specific wording advising the discarding of raw dataafter copying is not necessary or useful. ``True copies'' will be acceptableas raw data by EPA inspectors under andSection; 792.190. Signing and datingeach copy may be impractical and an acceptable alternative method may bedevised and incorporated into standard operating procedures to ensure theintegrity of the copies. Laboratories are cautioned that discarding originalsplaces additional burden on verification of the authenticity of the copies.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Regulatory Requirements </ITAG>A. Executive Order 12291 Under Executive Order 12291, EPA is required to judge whether a rule isa ``major'' one and is therefore subject to the requirement of a RegulatoryImpact Analysis. EPA has determined that these amendments of the TSCA GoodLaboratory Practice standards do not constitute a major rule because theydo not meet any of the criteria set forth and defined in section 1(b) ofthe Order. This rule was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) forreview as required by Executive Order 12291. Any comments from OMB to EPAand any EPA response to those comments are available for public inspectionat Information Policy Branch, PM-223, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460; and at the Office of Management andBudget, Washington, DC 20503, with OMB requests marked ``Attention: DeskOfficer for EPA.'' B. Regulatory Flexibility Act Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq., EPA is certifyingthat these amendments to the Good Laboratory Practice standards will nothave a significant impact on small businesses. Further, the revisions tothe TSCA GLP standards which reflect the FDA GLP revisions primarily providerelief from the original GLP standards (ICF 1987). Therefore, these amendmentsto the TSCA GLP standards are not expected to have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small businesses since little or no economicimpact is expected from the changes overall. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 792 </ITAG>Chemicals, Environmental protection, Good laboratory practices, Hazardousmaterials, Laboratories, Recordkeeping and reporting requirements.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: July 27, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">William K.
