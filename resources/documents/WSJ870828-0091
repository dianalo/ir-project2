In response to Mikhail Gorbachev's offer to destroy all of his SS-20s, Mr. Reagan has reduced U.S. verification demands.    Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany followed up with an offer to give up his 72 Pershing 1A missiles if the U.S. and the Soviet Union reach an Intermediate Nuclear Forces agreement. The initial Soviet response was to grouse about Germany's &quot;preconditions&quot; but chances for an INF treaty are increasing.    Let us all keep in mind, however, that the INF offers and counteroffers, even if they lead to a treaty, are mainly an exercise in symbolism. Neither side will destroy the nuclear warheads removed from the launchers. They will be deployed elsewhere. And even while the Soviets negotiate to destroy SS-20 launchers, they are deploying a new missile, the SS-24, that is even more formidable. It is mounted on rail cars, which means it can be hidden in tunnels. It can hit European targets, not to mention the U.S. and Japan, just as effectively as the SS-20.    Mr. Gorbachev makes much of his generous offer to destroy more intermediates than the U.S. But all that means is that there were a lot more intermediate launchers on his side than on the Western side. There will soon be SS-24s in their stead.    Mr. Reagan gives up the most in this game of symbolism. Mr. Gorbachev's main objective is to persuade Western Europe that he wants both peace and friendship. And by the way, says he, I also could use some Western money and technology in return for all my kindness. Mr. Reagan's efforts to avoid becoming a straight man for this dancing-bear act have not entirely succeeded.    Our point here is not to beat up on Ronald Reagan. All American presidents of the postwar era have been deeply affected by the awesomeness of nuclear weapons. And if an American president does not take the lead in trying to reduce international tensions a simple question arises: Who will? It also is worth noting that Mr. Reagan isn't getting much help at home. His attempts to bargain from strength, a fundamental necessity in dealing with the Russians, have been undermined repeatedly by the American left in its desperate and irresponsible efforts to destroy presidential power.    It should be noted as well that the president's Los Angeles speech Wednesday contained a strong vein of the old Reagan toughness, prompting a complaint from a Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman yesterday that the president is jeopardizing the arms talks. He is not backing down on the Strategic Defense Initiative. He will continue to support the Afghan resistance in its war with the Red Army and he is showing less and less inclination to be seduced by Speaker Jim Wright into turning a blind eye on the depredations of Central America's Communists.    Moreover, the State Department, presumably with someone's instruction, stiffed Mr. Gorbachev's suggestion that he might honor the United Nations with his presence this year if he could have a Security Council summit on &quot;disarmament and development.&quot; State said it hadn't noticed any indications that the Soviets are interested in aiding Third World development. It had, however, seen quite a lot of irascible Soviet propaganda saying that Western spending on arms is to blame for the Third World's sad condition. Let's hear it for State!    But let's also return to the INF issue. Symbolism has a place in politics, we suppose, but is it really wise for the United States to participate in nuclear-arms charades? Nuclear disarmament is not going to happen. There are many reasons for that, not the least being that it would be unthinkable for the U.S. and U.S.S.R. to disarm without assurances from 140 other nations around the world that they too will forgo nuclear arms for all time. The idea is preposterous. Moreover, nuclear disarmament would raise the risk of conventional war, which is not pretty either.    Wouldn't it be a lot more honest for an American president to simply say to the world that since nuclear disarmament is not in the cards, the U.S. and its allies will continue their policies of deterrence and defense? We can see little point in competing with the Soviet Union in a hypocrisy sweepstakes. It is demeaning and they are better at it.    But if we are in for some symbolism nonetheless, we at least can take some satisfaction in knowing that Mr. Reagan has demonstrated in the past several days that he still is president. Considering the events of the past year, that's not nothing. </TEXT></DOC>
