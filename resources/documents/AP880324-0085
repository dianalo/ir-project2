The Sandinistas also want a U.N. observer force to monitor theborder between the two countries, the spokesman said.   The request, filed with the court Monday, was disclosed as theSandinistas and the U.S.-backed Contral rebel forces trying tooverthrow the Nicaraguan government agreed to a 60-day cease-fireto begin April 1.   The world court, based in The Hague, is the judicial branch ofthe United Nations.   The Nicaraguan gambit revives a case suspended in August as aresult of the Central American peace plan. The plan was signed bythe presidents of Nicaragua, Honduras, Costa Rica, El Salvador andGuatemala.   Tensions on the Nicaraguan-Honduran border were reportedlyabating, despite a Honduran military report Wednesday that smallnumbers of Nicaraguan troops have entered Honduran territory in theSan Andres de Bocay region in Olancho province. Sandinista soldiersfought Contra rebels in the region last week.   The approximately 3,200 U.S. troops sent to Honduras last weekwere to be flown back to their bases in the United States earlynext week, the Pentagon said.   The U.S. troops were dispatched to Honduras after Hondurasaccused the Nicaraguan army of incursions into Honduran territoryearlier this month. The Pentagon said at the time of the airliftthat the American troops were in Honduras on a training mission.   The Sandinstas have denied crossing the Honduran border in theirskirmishes with the Contras and have in turn accused Hondurantroops of crossing the Nicaraguan border to support the rebels.   The Nicaraguan Embassy here claimed today that ``several Contraincursions with Honduran support'' occurred in the course of March.   In its request, Nicaragua asked the court to launch ``an inquiry... investigating the recent incidents in the Bocay (border) regionand the causes of such incidents.''   And it requested ``the creation of a group of observers by theappropriate organ of the United Nations to monitor incidents at theborder region.''   The request is part of an ongoing case against Honduras thatNicaragua brought before the court 18 months ago.   Nicaragua originally sought a court ruling ordering Honduras tohalt alleged support for the Contras. Managua has repeatedlyclaimed that the Contras are operating from bases inside Honduras.Honduras has not denied that there are Contra bases on itsterritory but has said it is powerless to halt the rebel activities.   No date has been set for hearings on Nicaragua's request.</TEXT></DOC>
