(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   In a tranquil, tree-lined park near theprairie, teen-agers from China, the Soviet Union and the UnitedStates have been writing a play they hope will help make theirdreams of peace come true.   The script developed over the past two weeks opens withcharacters from each country on a stage behind a mountain toppedwith a star. Discord among them is represented by fog as theystruggle musically, occasionally striking a note of harmony.   At the end of the play, the star on the mountain comes to thecharacters, and pieces of the mountain form a bridge to theaudience.   ``Our goal must be to show peace and friendship,'' said ShanJian, one of two 16-year-olds from Beijing who joined two othersfrom the Soviet Union and the United States in writing the script.   The Chinese participants are leaving Thursday, but next summer,15 students from China and the Soviet Union are expected to arrivein Fargo to work with young American artists on the performance.The play, financed through an assortment of private and publicsources, then is scheduled to tour the United States, the SovietUnion and China.   ``It's really a process to create a link between the people ofthese nations,'' says Vicki Chepulis, director of the ``Imagine''program at the Trollwood Performing Arts School.   Set on a 44-acre park in this city of 100,000, Trollwood wascreated in 1978 following the model of Washington's Wolf Trap, tooffer young people a chance to study the performing arts. More than300 students come each summer.   The involvement of the Soviet and Chinese students, who arrivedlast month, began with a visit by Trollwood founder John Marks toChina in 1986. He proposed an exchange, about the same timeChepulis was proposing an exchange with students from the SovietUnion.   ``In our own naive way, we said, `Why don't we do both?'''Chepulis recalled. Officials in China and the Soviet Unionsupported the idea.   ``What we really strive for is creativity and confidence,''Marks said, ``with the attitude that you need to be friends beforeyou can write a play.   ``To me, the whole way this project started was a dream.Everybody wants to have a peaceful world. What better way to showthat than through the arts?''   The play, with a working title ``Imagine,'' aims to be acelebration of the three cultures and a challenge to others toimagine what it would be like if people of all countries could worktogether.   It is designed as a rock opera with the story conveyed throughmusic and movement instead of words.   One of the Chinese student advisers is Ding Zhen Chun, 49, whoseperformance as the ``Monkey King'' is a highlight of the BeijingOpera. Ding said he was not worried that the recent violence thatfollowed student demonstrations in China would threaten theprogram, even though it did delay the students' arrival in Fargo.But they preferred not to talk about it.   ``What it really made me realize is that it was just people topeople, and that's all we were interested in. I think ... they justwanted to focus the project,'' Chepulis said.</TEXT></DOC>
