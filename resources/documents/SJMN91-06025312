Her dad is '50s countryhit-maker Carl Smith, and her mom is singer June Carter Cash, now married, aswe all know, to Johnny Cash. Which makes Rosanne Cash her stepsister; Carlene,that is. Carlene Carter; remember her?;    &quot;I think people must either throwup or doze off when they read those stories about me that talk about myfamily,&quot; Carlene Carter says with a twangy giggle that tickles all thoselong-distance wires between here and Las Vegas.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Weekend  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  CARLENE'S COUNTRYLATEST STAR IN LEGENDARY CARTER FAMILY FOUNDA LOVE FOR HER MUSICAL HERITAGE AND ROAD TOTHE TOP OF THE CHARTS  </HEADLINE><TEXT>      She can laugh about it now. After all, her 1990 album, &quot;I Fell in Love,&quot;has been burning up the country charts, along with the hit single of the sametitle. A week ago, it won her a Grammy nomination for best female countryvocal performer. Now 35, she is out on a tour (which makes its way to Slim'sin San Francisco, Saturday), playing to enthusiastic crowds and critics.;   And, after kicking about in London for many years, releasing one good andseveral bad albums and never really knowing who she was, Carlene Carter is nowa Star.;    &quot;I'm very excited and a little surprised that people actually likeit,&quot; she says of &quot;I Fell in Love.&quot; &quot;I decided that with this record&quot; -- shewrote (or co-wrote) nine of the 11 songs on it -- &quot;I was going to put a lot ofthought into it and commit myself as an artist. I wanted to make the recordfor myself.&quot;;    With producer Howie Epstein (of the Heartbreakers) in tow,she created a set of songs that bristles with rocking energy and countryfeistiness and simmers with affection for Carter's heritage.;    The title cuthas a rockabilly kick, while &quot;The Sweetest Thing&quot; is a lip-smacking ballad. On&quot;Me and the Wildwood Rose,&quot; Carter speaks of her childhood days spent growingup with Mother Maybelle and the Carter clan. And she does a version of &quot;YouAre The One,&quot; which was a No. 1 country hit for her daddy the week she wasborn.;    &quot;(The record) just worked out,&quot; she says. &quot;I guess that's what comeswith maturity . . . and a few flops.&quot;;    The maturity was the hard part; theflops just seemed to come naturally. By the time she hit the country scene in1978, Carter had two teen-age marriages -- with a child apiece -- behind her.She was 22, had looks that could kill and a voice that could save your soul.;   Nashville goes punk;    And that pedigree that she couldn't shake with astick.;    &quot;I was really rebelling at the time,&quot; she says. &quot;I was desperatelywanting to be myself. I didn't like it when everyone compared me with LindaRonstadt or, especially, my family.&quot;;    &quot;I (seemed to) have a helluva lot ofparents. I wanted to be known for myself.&quot;;    So what did she do? She hookedup with that good old boy, Brit pub-rocker Nick Lowe, and headed for London.They got married. She dressed up in post-punk gear and released &quot;MusicalShapes,&quot; an excellent album that blended country with the edgy new-wave rockof the time. Not a bad trick for 1979.;    &quot;I loved that record,&quot; she says.&quot;It was way ahead of its time. I don't want to sound conceited about it, butit had a sound to it that has become popular these days.&quot;;    But at the time,the record business didn't know what to make of it, or her.;    &quot;I fell in thecracks,&quot; she says. &quot;Nick and I thought we had made a country record. But thecountry radio stations wouldn't play it because there was limeys playing on itand I was married to a limey. And it was too country for pop radio.&quot; Thecritics raved, but the record bombed.;    Hits and misses;    Over the nextfew years, Carter released new albums, all flops. She wrote songs that wererecorded by such performers as Emmylou Harris (&quot;Easy from Now On&quot;) and theGo-Go's. She and Lowe split in 1985. Her career was in shambles.;    &quot;I was ina big hurry, but I didn't know where I was going,&quot; she says. &quot;I wanted to be astar, but I didn't know what a star was. I was lazy. I'd decide to make arecord and write a few songs and record them with whoever I was hanging outwith at the time.&quot;;    In 1987, her past caught up with her. Not her recentpast but the past of her childhood and her family legacy. Her mother, June,and her aunts, Helen and Anita, were on tour when Anita got sick in London.Carlene was asked to take her place. For the next two years, she toured withthe Carter Family, and along the way she found herself.;    Home at last; &quot;That tour really added something -- a sense of myself that was missing. I hadbeen feisty and smart-assed about my family, but on that tour I learned tolove it and be proud of it. Before that, I had never had the time to learnabout it or be a part of it. After that tour, I wanted that music to be a partof my music.&quot;;    In 1988, she met Epstein, and the two hit it off musicallyand personally.;    &quot;I had been trying to find a place that felt right. Hejust knew how to do what I wanted to do with my music. I wanted to make acountry record that was rootsy, and that's what we did.&quot;;    Now, with herlazy days in the past, Carter is working constantly, touring to promote &quot;IFell in Love&quot; and hard at work on her next album, due in the fall.;    &quot;It'sgonna be more mountain-ey,&quot; she says, &quot;with a lot of acoustic tracks. Butrocking.&quot;;    It took time, but Carter says she now has a sense of focus toher life that wasn't there before. &quot;It comes with age, I suppose,&quot; she says.&quot;One day, when I was 31, I woke up and realized that I wasn't a star and said,'I've got to get off my can.' I had to get the guts up to do it. But I'm gladI did.&quot;; Carlene Carter; When: 9 p.m. Saturday; Where: Slim's, 333 11th St.,San Francisco; Tickets: $12, $13 day of show, (408) 998-2277 or (415) 762-2277  </TEXT><BYLINE>  HARRY SUMRALL, Mercury News Pop Music Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910125  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  1,089  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday January 25, 199100025312,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  0  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
