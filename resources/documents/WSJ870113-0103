Young</HL><DD> 01/13/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> PHARMACEUTICALS, HOSPITAL SUPPLIES, MANAGEMENT (PHA) </IN><TEXT>   Defining the terms &quot;biotechnology&quot; and &quot;genetic engineering&quot; isn't an easy task, since the terms don't represent natural groupings of processes or products. They connote something different to individual commentators, journalists, organizations, congressional staffers and members of the public. The terms are ambiguous, the source of much confusion and little advantage, and we would do well to return to more specific and descriptive terms. Laymen would understand them better and the complaints of poorly informed critics would be put into perspective.    The term &quot;biotechnology,&quot; which seems to have originated in the 1970s, is defined in numerous ways. One of the broader definitions -- the application of biological systems and organisms to technical and industrial processes -- was coined by a White House working group on biotechnology several years ago and clearly encompasses both old and new processes and products. These include processes as different as fish farming, the production of enzymes for laundry detergents and the genetic manipulation of bacteria to clean up oil spills or to produce insulin. The press, on the other hand, often uses &quot;biotechnology&quot; to mean only its newest, state-of-the-art manifestations. &quot;Genetic engineering&quot; is at least as much abused.    These usages often are disingenuous. Neither biotechnology nor genetic engineering is a new concept. A primitive form of biotechnology dates back at least to 6000 B.C. when the Babylonians used microorganisms in fermentation to brew alcoholic beverages. And genetic engineering should be dated from man's recognition that animals and crop plants can be selected to enhance desired characteristics.    During the past half-century, better understanding of genetics at the molecular level has added to the sophistication of the genetic manipulation of microorganisms. An excellent example is the genetic improvement of the mold that produces penicillin: During the past several decades, penicillin yields have been increased more than a hundredfold. Similarly, agricultural crops have been genetically improved with astonishing success. The genetic engineering of corn plants for human consumption was recognized in 1970 with the Nobel Prize. These are &quot;genetic engineering&quot; successes of monumental proportions. The newest biotechnological techniques, called recombinant DNA, or &quot;gene-splicing,&quot; provide still more precise, better understood, and more predictable methods for manipulating genetic material in useful ways.    It shouldn't be surprising that confusion about scientific terminology is endemic among the public and the press, when governments and even scientists suffer from the same malady. Several recent examples are instructive.    In 1985, a bill was introduced in Congress that defined a &quot;genetically engineered&quot; microorganism for purposes of regulation in an extraordinary way -- as &quot;a bacterium, virus, fungus, blue-green alga, or protist, the genetic material of which has deliberately been altered by human intervention.&quot; This definition, seemingly plucked from the ether, encompasses innumerable current production organisms of economic importance that are innocuous by any criteria (including those used to manufacture new biotechnology products such as human insulin, growth hormone, interferons, and hepatitis B vaccine, as well as traditional biotechnology products such as penicillin, tetracycline, live viral vaccines, etc.). At the same time, the definition would omit organisms well known to be harmful to man, animals or plants. This demonstrates the folly of using an ambiguous term -- especially when it is then defined arbitrarily and carelessly.    Another example of the confusion and lack of precision surrounding &quot;biotechnology&quot; occurred during the deliberations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Working Group on Biotechnology. These efforts yielded a widely praised document on recombinant DNA safety considerations. However, a second major part of the project -- a description of governmental regulation of &quot;biotechnology&quot; in OECD member countries-had to be abandoned.    The information for this project was to have been obtained by a questionnaire sent to appropriate agencies within the various countries. It defined genetic engineering broadly, and, it was hoped, clearly and prominently: &quot;Genetic engineering is considered broadly and can include the manipulation of genetic material by (1) recombinant DNA techniques; (2) other techniques such as mutation, hybridoma, conjugation, transduction, etc.; and (3) more traditional techniques, such as selective breeding.&quot; However, the returns showed that different countries had used widely disparate definitions to frame their responses. Some considered only recombinant DNA processes and products; others used the broad definition as requested; still others employed an intermediate interpretation.    The anecdotes described here are not isolated incidents, and there is accumulating disenchantment with the rubric &quot;biotechnology.&quot; A recent General Accounting Office report on biotechnology concluded: &quot;Because of the inconsistent interpretation of the term 'biotechnology,' . . . {i}t may be useful, for the purpose of discussing possible regulatory approaches, to avoid the term 'biotechnology' and instead use more specific terms. . . .&quot; David Kingsbury, assistant director of the National Science Foundation, made the same point during a recent conference sponsored by the Office of Technology Assessment that addressed research funding for &quot;biotechnology.&quot;    The GAO and Mr. Kingsbury are correct. There is a need for more precise communication in science and technology generally, and specifically for cleaning up the &quot;biotechnology&quot; and &quot;genetic engineering&quot; argot. Reference to the appropriate constituents or subsets of these catch-alls would be more informative, lucid and useful. Biochemistry, microbiology, ecology, recombinant DNA, live vaccines, therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, enzymes. By using terms such as these, we would convey our meaning more clearly, whether the intent is to laud progress, or to call for oversight, or to seek additional funding. Is that degree of verbal and literary discipline too much to ask?    ---   Dr. Miller is special assistant to Dr. Young, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration. </TEXT></DOC>
