Petrographic andchemical studies of the coals being extensively worked in the differentparts of the coalfield and of the drill cores indicated progressive variationin petrographic composition and rank. This work establishes that besideshigh geothermal gradient responsible for development of coking characteristics,thermal metamorphism of the coal due to igneous intrusions has increasedthe rank of the coal seams, adjacent to the Bamhani-Chilpa Fault thattraverses through the middle portion of the coalfield. 18 refs., 4 figs.,3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
