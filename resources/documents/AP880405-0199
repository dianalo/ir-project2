More than 30 people were killed on Nov. 29 as gangs of armed menrampaged through the streets of Port-au-Prince, shooting atcivilians who fled in panic. Police and military units patrollingthe capital did not intervene.   The election was stopped after the polls had been open forseveral hours. Government-controlled elections subsequently wereheld on Jan. 17, but they were boycotted by opposition groups andthe voter turnout was low.   The military junta in power last fall appointed four civiliansand two army officers to determine who was responsible for the Nov.29 violence and submit a report by Jan. 15.   Contents of the report were not made public but Radio Metropole,in a broadcast Monday, gave some details.   It said the committee reported it could not identify individualsresponsible for the election day violence, or for numerouspre-election killings and cases of arson. But the committee reportsaid it had identified those responsible ``collectively so that thegovernment can prosecute them,'' Radio Metropole said. It did notlist any groups.   The radio station said the committee report criticized variousagencies, saying they had contributed to the collapse of orderduring the election, which would have been Haiti's first freeballoting in 30 years.   The broadcast said the committee accused the police of notproviding adquate security, claimed the Ministry of Information hadnot properly informed Haitians about their civic duties and saidthe courts failed to document the election-day events as requiredby law.   An independent electoral council that organized the ballotingfailed to accomplish its constitutional mission and allowed``foreign powers'' to become involved in national affairs, thereport said, according to Radio Metropole.   It said the committee recommended payment of compensation forvictims of the violence and their relatives, strengthening thepolice force and intensified searches for illegal weapons.   After the balloting was canceled, the three-member juntadissolved the independent electoral council and appointed its owncouncil to oversee the January election.   Leslie Manigat was elected president and installed in officeFeb. 7, the second anniversary of former dictator Jean-ClaudeDuvalier's flight to exile in France.</TEXT></DOC>
