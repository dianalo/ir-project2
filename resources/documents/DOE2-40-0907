Early designs consisted of a fiberglass tube with an internaldiameter of 1.0 centimeter and a length of 8 centimeters with four internalelectrodes. A 2 milliwatt He/Ne laser was positioned down the centerof the tube. External air was sucked into the tube and polarizable fiberscaused to spin at the quadrature frequency reflecting the laser lightat right angles to the long axis of the fiber. A photomultiplier capturedthe pulses of light generated and fed the data to a small computer. Onedrawback of the system was that fiberglass and samples of different typesof asbestos produced output signals which were very similar. A new designwas developed that employed eight electrodes made from round platinumwires. Long fibers were distinguished from short fibers by the narrownessof the beam reflected.</TEXT></DOC>
