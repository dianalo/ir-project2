The maker of products for the computer industry had fourth-quarter revenue of $1.3 million. In the 1985 fourth quarter, net income was $76,000, or two cents a share, on revenue of $3.3 million.    In all of 1986, American Magnetics had a net loss of $925,000, after a $607,000 gain from the sale of mortgages, on revenue of $8.4 million. In 1985, net income totaled $1.2 million, or 25 cents a share, on revenue of $16.1 million.
