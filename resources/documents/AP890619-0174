All that is missing is theclick of camera shutters and the gasps of thrilled foreigners.   The tourist season is here, but there are few people climbingChina's most famous sight _ the ``Chang Cheng,'' or Great Wall.   Few people snap up souvenirs or visit the many restaurants thatcater to travelers, much to the dismay of the Chinese who rely ontourism for their livelihood.   A Chinese man lingering where tourists can begin walking to thetop of the wall, part of a 45-mile stretch as Mutianyu, offered anexplanation. Asked about the tourist drought, he pantomimes theshooting of a machine gun, a reference to the government's violentmilitary suppression of demonstrators two weeks ago in centralBeijing.   ``There is so little to do now without the foreigners. We're verytired because we're not busy,'' he says.   The crackdown on the demonstrators and the worldwide condemnationit has generated have chilled China's burgeoning tourism industry.   The state-run China International Travel Service has beenencouraging foreigners asking about travel within China to continuewith their plans to visit the vast country, saying all areas open totourists are safe.   Economically, there is much at stake.   Earlier this year, the National Tourism Administration releasedfigures showing that China earned $2.2 billion in foreign currencyfrom tourism in 1988, up 19.4 percent from 1987. Through last year,tourism had brought in $12 billion since the country was opened toforeign visitors in 1978, the figures show.   The wall, which winds over mountains and through valleys, is oneof China's premier tourist attractions.   At Mutianyu, about 50 miles north of Beijing, vendors andticket-takers seemed surprised by foreign visitors who came Mondayto see the stone barrier built along China's northern frontier toprotect against invasion. The great work was begun in the thirdcentury B.C.   Two people who wanted to ride a cable car to the top had to huntfor someone to sell them tickets. After the purchase, they lookedfor someone to start the cable car on its way up the mountain.   Later, at the base of the mountain, a vendor pushed for a sale.He motioned to T-shirts and silk quilts displayed on a table at theend of a row of about 40 empty stalls.   ``I give you good deal, best deal,'' he said in English.   When a foreigner started to walk away without buying, the vendortalked faster, promising an ``even better deal.''   ``Please buy. Please buy here. Good price here. I give you bestprice here.''   At the nearby Yisong restaurant, the only person in the diningroom read a newspaper as he leaned back in his chair, his legsresting on top of a table.   ``Closed, closed. The restaurant is closed,'' he said whensomeone entered the room. He indicated there were no definite plansto reopen.   ``When more people come to see the Great Wall we will sell themfood,'' he said. ``When will that be? I don't know.''</TEXT></DOC>
