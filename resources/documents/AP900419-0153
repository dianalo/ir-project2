John Glenn said Thursday as hereleased an investigative report with more questions than answers.   ``None of the three services has a complete grip on what typeand how much low-level radioactive waste it has generated,'' saidGlenn, D-Ohio, who made public a report prepared at his request bythe General Accounting Office.   Glenn said he wanted the auditors to figure out how much it willcost the military to deal with its waste, but they didn't haveenough information even to attempt an estimate. All they could saywith certainty was that the cost of disposing of the waste is goingto skyrocket.   The Army has found that surcharges tacked onto the cost ofdisposing of its low-level radioactive waste over the next fewyears will be higher than the actual disposal cost and ``We can'teven take a guess as to what the Navy and Air Force may have to paybecause they don't have accurate records,'' Glenn said.   Glenn's interest in the radioactive waste on military bases wastriggered by a 1986 spill at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base nearDayton, Ohio, that cost the government more than $1 million toclean up.   Unmarked drums of radioactive americium-241, which had beenbrought illegally onto the base, were accidentally opened,contaminating a building and exposing some workers.   After that episode, the Navy and Air Force initiated surveys todiscover how much and what kind of waste was stored at eachinstallation. But the GAO report said those surveys weren'tcompleted. Just under half of the installations returned theirsurvey questionnaires, the report said.   The Air Force is scheduled this year to begin excavatinglow-level radioactive waste buried in the early 1950s. After theAir Force stopped burying that waste it failed to provideinstructions on maintaining the sites or record-keeping, the reportsaid.   ``As a result the Air Force is facing a cleanup situation ofunknown proportions,'' he said.   The Air Force referred a request for comment to Capt. Sig Adams,who did not return a telephone message. The GAO report said thefacts in the report were discussed with officials in all threemilitary branches and ``they generally agreed with the facts.''   Glenn said he's ``considering various legislative options,'' buthe wants the Pentagon to get a fix on the problem and put aradioactive waste disposal program in place without having   ``This points out the problem. It's up to them to dosomething,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
