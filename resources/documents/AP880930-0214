Minutes before the stock market closed Thursday, Maxwell boostedhis cash tender offer to $90.25 a share from $86.80 in the latestassault in a four-month-old takeover battle.   Traders had little chance to react to the fresh bid, whichtopped a cash-and-stock offer Macmillan's board had accepted fromthe buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. Earlier in the week,Macmillan agreed to be acquired by Kohlberg in a cash andsecurities deal the firm valued at $90.05 a share.   Maxwell alternatively offered $900 million for four prizedivisions that Macmillan had promised to sell to Kohlberg for $865million in the event the firm was unsuccessful in acquiring thecompany as a whole.   Such so-called ``lock-up'' agreements generally are used todiscourage rival bidders.   The businesses include Macmillan's direct marketing group; itsdirectory division, which publishes Who's Who and otherdirectories; the Berlitz language schools; and Michie Co., whichpublishes state legal codes.   In a ``Dear Ned'' letter to Edward P. Evans, Macmillan'schairman and chief executive, Maxwell noted ``we have said from thebeginning, we are desirous of purchasing Macmillan Inc. in itsentirety.''   Failing that, Maxwell offered to terminate the tender offer ifhe could have the four divisions, which he dubbed Macmillan's``crown jewels.''   If shareholders warm to Maxwell's offer, the British publishercould gain a controlling stake in Macmillan without the board'sapproval.   Macmillan had no comment on Maxwell's revised tender offer,which will expire Oct. 13, unless extended.   Earlier in the week Maxwell proposed acquiring the company for$89 a share in a negotiated transaction and said he asked Macmillanrepresentatives for an opportunity to top any bid the companyreceived.   ``They refused to permit this,'' he said in the letter to Evans.   Maxwell has sharply criticized the true value of the Kohlbergoffer, contending that ``members of the financial community'' saidthe package is worth less than $89 a share.   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Macmillanrose 25 cents to close at $88.87{ a share.   Maxwell, head of Maxwell Communication Corp., had askedMacmillan to conduct a fair auction, but his lawyers have chargedthat the bidding process has been rigged.   Maxwell said his latest offer was less conditional than theKolhberg offer because it was not subject to financing, ``whereasthe (Kohlberg) offer contains a broad financing condition.''   Attorneys for the Robert M. Bass Group, which controls 9.2percent of Macmillan and sparked the bidding war for the companyfour months ago, also challenged Macmillan's lock-up agreement withKohlberg in court on Wednesday.   Bass filed a motion to intervene in a case Maxwell has againstthe company, and charged Macmillan directors had breached theirfiduciary duty by granting the lock-up.   The Bass group initially offered to acquire Macmillan for $64 ashare but backed out when the stock price began to rise steeply.   In mid-September, the Macmillan board approved Kohlberg'sinitial $85-a-share proposal but withdrew its backing last weekafter Maxwell raised his offer to $86.80 a share from $80.</TEXT></DOC>
