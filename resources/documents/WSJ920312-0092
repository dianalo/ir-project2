Certainly something more than a little unusualhas been going on here, but a mighty effort seems to be underway to engineer what some years ago might have been called acover-up. Others are seeking the facts. North Carolina Rep.Charles Taylor, for example, is pressing for full disclosure.He can't square the Ethics Committee's report with a surveyof all House Members by Roll Call, the Capitol Hillnewspaper. The committee found that 296 current Members kitedchecks during a 39-month period, and only 139 did not. But338 Members told Roll Call last October that they had notoverdrawn their accounts at all in the previous two years.Perhaps a lot of Members simply kept very poor records. It'shard to tell yet whether we've finally stumbled upon acongressional scandal of Watergate dimensions, with trustedaides staring at obstruction-of-justice charges and the like.Still, one senses that the Capitol ground is rumbling andthat some of the solons may have to worry about getting hitwith falling plaster.</LP><TEXT/></DOC>
