U.S. District Judge Barrington D. Parker issued the preliminaryinjunction pending trial on a lawsuit by the Air Line PilotsAssociation. The order says Eastern must stop training non-unionpilots on its planes by Orion Lift Services, Inc.   In the order handed down late Tuesday, Parker said the trainingprogram ``constitutes a unilateral repudiation of the collectivebargaining agreement'' Eastern has with the pilots union.   ``The plain language of the agreement requires that Easternutilize pilots from the system seniority list to perform any typeof flying'' _ including flight training, the judge said.   Moreover, ``Eastern has failed to offer a reasonableinterpretation of the contract which would justify its conduct norhas it proven that this type of leasing arrangement is justified bypast practices,'' Parker said.   The judge dismissed as ``completely spurious'' the company'sargument it was entitled to engage in strike preparations``irrespective of the terms of its agreement with ALPA.''   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said the Miami-based airlinewould not comment on the decision until company officials had anopportunity to review it.   Orion, based in Raleigh, N.C., signed a contract earlier thisyear to hire and train 350 to 400 non-union pilots to fly Easternplanes in the event ALPA honored a possible strike by 13,000airline employees represented by the International Association ofMachinists and Aerospace Workers.   The agreement called for Orion to fly as many as 25 Easternplanes out of Atlanta during a strike. The pilots union has notindicated whether it would honor a machinists strike.   One aircraft was leased to the company to train non-union pilotsin Louisville and Eastern officials testified that as many as fivemore would be transferred to Orion for that purpose.   Orion needed to conduct the training on Eastern planes to obtainFederal Aviation Administration certification to carry passengersin the event of a walkout.   The machinists' union and Eastern are now conductingnegotiations under the auspices of the National Mediation Board. Ifthe board declares an impasse, the union could strike following a30-day cooling off period that is prescribed by the Railway LaborAct.   The pilots union has not said whether it would honor amachinists strike. ALPA itself is preparing to begin negotiationswith Eastern to update its contract, which will be open for changesin June.   Parker barred the airline from unilaterally changing its laboragreement with the pilots union.   He also enjoined Eastern from using any pilots not on theunion's seniority list ``as a means of undermining ALPA's status asthe exclusive collective bargaining representative for the airlinepilots employed by Eastern.''   The decision is the second legal setback for the financiallytroubled airline this month.   On March 10, another federal judge here held the airline incontempt of court for taking steps to sell its Eastern Air Shuttleto another subsidiary created by the company's parent, Texas Air.   U.S. District Judge John H. Pratt also ordered Eastern to pay afine of $10,000 for each day it was in contempt of his order afterApril 5. A federal appeals court last week refused to stay thecontempt order.</TEXT></DOC>
