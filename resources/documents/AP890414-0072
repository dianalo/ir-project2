(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A man who fails to support his child'smother emotionally and financially prior to birth loses hisstanding in an adoption case, the Florida Supreme Court has ruled.   ``Because prenatal care of the pregnant mother and unborn childis critical to the well-being of the child and of society, thebiological father, wed or unwed, has a responsibility to providesupport during the pre-birth period,'' Justice Leander Shaw wrotefor the majority in a 6-1 opinion Thursday.   Failure to provide that support can constitute abandonment.Normally, a father's consent is required for adoption, but a fatherwho abandons his unborn child loses that right, the high court held.   The ruling is important because it sets the precedent that thefather's level of ``prebirth support'' can be considered by a judgeto determine his standing in an adoption case.   The ruling came in the case of an infant identified only as JohnDoe to protect his identity. A judge in Orange County rejected therequest of the biological parents, dubbed Richard and Mary Roe, toregain custody from the adoptive parents, Bob and Jane Doe.   The Roes were unwed when the baby was born Sept. 12, 1986.   The 5th District Court of Appeal in Daytona Beach reversed thedecision, but allowed the baby to stay with the adoptive parentspending the Supreme Court ruling.   In a sharply worded dissent, Justice Parker Lee McDonald wrotethat the majority has deprived the biological parents, now married,of their child ``without a finding that the natural parents areunfit in the slightest. I think it is a sad day.''   When Mary Roe became pregnant, the father said he wasn't readyto commit to marriage, in part because of financial pressure, andurged her to have an abortion, Shaw wrote.   She refused, lost her job and lived off public welfare andcharity. While Roe failed to provide support, they continued to seeeach other and he initially voiced no objection to adoption,although never giving formal consent.   The Supreme Court also ruled the mother couldn't withdraw herconsent to the adoption, although she attempted to do so only a fewdays after the child was given to the Does three days after thebaby was born.   She contended her consent had been given under the duress of herpersonal circumstances, but those circumstances changed when Roeagreed to marry her.   The high court held a mother can revoke her consent afteradoption only if another person had exerted coercion, duress orfraud to procure that consent.</TEXT></DOC>
