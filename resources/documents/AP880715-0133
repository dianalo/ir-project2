(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The space agency announced Friday ithas transferred custody of the Delta space rocket launch complexand East Coast Delta launch operations to the Air Force.   The transfer ends an era during which NASA launched 143 Deltasfrom two pads at Launch Complex 17 in 28 years. An additional 38launches have been conducted from Vandenberg Air Force Base,Calif., and the McDonnell Douglas-built rocket has achieved a 95percent success record, orbiting more than 60 communicationssatellites, 30 weather satellites and dozens of payloads forscience and Earth resources research.   NASA's first Delta launch here on May 13, 1960, failed, but thesecond, three months later, orbited the Echo communicationssatellite. The agency's last launch, on Feb. 8 this year, sent aStrategic Defense Inititive payload into space.   The agency still has one Delta rocket remaining in itsinventory. It will boost a scientific satellite next year fromVandenberg.   President Reagan last year endorsed a private-sector commerciallaunch business using unmanned rockets and directed NASA topurchase launch services from companies like McDonnell Douglas andGeneral Dynamics. In April 1987, the space agency transferred itsauthority over the Atlas-Centaur space rocket and Launch Complex 36here to General Dynamics.   Until the transfers of the two rockets, NASA had purchased theboosters from the companies and had acted as its own launch agency.Now it must buy launch services from the companies.   The Air Force plans to use the two Delta launch pads here tolaunch SDI and other military payloads with Delta and advancedDelta 2 rockets purchased from McDonnell Douglas. The first Delta 2launch is scheduled here later this year.   McDonnell Douglas will negotiate with the Air Force for the useof the pads to launch Delta 2 commerical payloads, with eight suchlaunches planned from 1989 to 1992.   The Air Force also plans to take over Atlas-Centaur LaunchComplex 36 to launch an advanced model of the rocket with militarypayloads. General Dynamics then will negotiate with the Air Forcefor use of the two pads there for commercial satellite launches.</TEXT></DOC>
