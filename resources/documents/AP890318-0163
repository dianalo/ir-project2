It's the samething Caterpillar went through, and we didn't have protection. Wehad to bite the bullet. That's what modernization is all about.''</TEXT><TEXT>   At LTV Steel's Indiana Harbor Works in East Chicago, Ind., one ofthe mammoth mills that line the lakeshore between Chicago and Gary,Ind., general manager Richard A. Veitch finds it inconceivable thatanyone could accuse the steel industry of not modernizing.   ``We're high tech. We're a far more sophisticated industry thanpeople realize,'' said Veitch.   LTV, which went into Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1986, invested morethan $325 million to modernize its operations last year. A sizablechunk went to Indiana Harbor, which recently opened a $76 millionladle metallurgy facility to produce high quality, ultra-low carbonsteel.   In 1987 LTV spent $130 million rebuilding a huge blast furnace atIndiana Harbor and relined a second major furnace last year at acost of $70 million.   Five years ago, said Veitch, ``blast furnaces didn't havecomputers and all these CRT screens with all this stuff flashing onthem. But today one guy sits in a room and knows what's going on inthe whole furnace.''   Behind other weathered, hulking steel facades, small crews sit incomputer-lined ``pulpits'' running fiery steel-making operationsthat once required twice as many workers.   The Indiana Harbor Works has a continuous casting facility thatset a world production record in 1987. Instead of pouring the moltensteel into ingots, the caster allows steel to be molded into slabsand sent hurtling down the line like a glowing tobaggan, stretchedto thousandths of an inch by rollers and cooled with torrents ofwater. The steel emerges in hot, rolled coils produced in a fractionof the time and cost of old methods.   Indiana Harbor is LTV's front-line plant that gets the firstorders and the first improvements. A sister plant in Cleveland stillmakes half its steel in ingots and lacks a ladle metallurgy facility.   ``We have just begun to scratch the surface of trying to climbback up and become economically viable,'' said Veitch. As anindustry, ``we've got to get to 100 percent continuous cast''instead of the current 65 percent.   ``Just from this plant's perspective, I've got a lot more thatneeds to be done to be truly, consistently world competitive,'' saidVeitch, who speaks enviously of advances the Japanese and Europeanshave made on hot-strip rolling mills.   Veitch is nonplused by the complaints from Caterpillar.   ``If you look at the whole world market situation, we're not outof line in terms of prices,'' the plant manager said. ``We're justapproaching levels price-wise that we were at in 1982.''   In Chicago, at the top of the Inland Steel building, InlandDirector of Corporate Communications Sam H. Saran grumbled, ``Whatdo they want us to do? Give our steel away like we did for fouryears?''   The U.S. mills boast they are now producing a ton of steel at alower average cost than any country in the world. Costs are down 35percent since 1982, productivity is up 40 percent, and quality isgreatly improved, they say.   The steelmakers say they reinvested $9 billion in modernizingplants and equipment between 1982-87, a third more than their cashflow from steel. The VRA legislation requires such reinvestment.   Graham, the president of the USX steel division, said, ``When yousee (Chrysler's) Lee Iacocca on television announcing a newseven-year (car) guarantee, you want to recall that that's madepossible by technological innovation in the domestic steelindustry.''   ``Nowhere in the world is steel sold at prices as low as it iscurrently in the U.S.,'' Graham said at a recent VRA debatesponsored by the Economic Policy Institute.   ``American auto makers are paying about $100 per ton less fortheir domestic steel than Toyota is paying in Japan,'' said Heinz,the Pennsylvania senator.</TEXT><TEXT>   The rise of the yen and mark have narrowed the once formidablewage gap between U.S. steel workers and their foreign counterparts.U.S. steel workers' wages have risen only 2.5 percent since 1982 to$14.78 per hour, according to the WEFA group _ a fact that theUnited Steelworkers Union will emphasize in negotiations to renewlabor contracts that expire this July 31 at four of the big six U.S.steelmakers. Fringes add almost $10 an hour to the steel workers'compensation.   Steel imports, which claimed 26 percent of the U.S. market in1984, dropped to 21 percent in 1988, just above the VRA targetlevel. Some countries did not ship their full quotas to the UnitedStates, presumably because they could fetch higher prices elsewhere.While 20 million tons were imported last year, U.S. steel makersexported 2 million tons.   In the event that the VRAs are not extended, steel companies arekeeping trade law specialists like Alan Wolff busy preparinghundreds of unfair trade cases to bring before the InternationalTrade Commission against foreign producers.   It was in part the difficulty of trying to resolve a myriad ofsuch disputes through the ITC that prompted the Reaganadministration to embrace VRAs in 1984.   Gary Hufbauer, a Georgetown University professor of internationalfinance who favors a phaseout of the VRAs, said the steelmakers want``insurance against a cyclical downturn or an overvalued dollar inthe 1990s.''   But Wolff countered that, ``The international conditions thatgave rise to the VRAs have not changed significantly.''   ``Steel and the State,'' a 580-page book co-authored by Wolff,charges the steel industry in Europe was kept alive only by``repeated, massive injuections of state aid,'' including $35billion between 1980 and 1985 alone. Currently, Italy's state-ownedFinsider Group is getting almost $6 billion in new subsidies, saidWolff.   ``Getting plant and equipment at zero cost is an unbeatablecompetitive advantage,'' he said.   USX's Graham has a ready answer when asked why the renascentsteel industry is putting so much vigor into the fight for VRAs.   ``We're at the top of the cycle. This is a cyclical business. Andwe know it will turn down someday. That's when VRAs are important.They are a soft-market mechanism,'' Graham said. ``But they're apolitical device so you've got to get them in place.''   Heinz isn't ready to declare victory.   ``It isn't over 'til it's over,'' said the co-chairman of theSenate Steel Caucus. ``Trade disputes are always very chancy.''   Several major newspapers have railed against extension of theVRAs, saying it's time for big steel to stand on its own.   Inland's Saran replies, ``We're getting the same kind ofmisguided editorials from all the newspapers, all of whom are freetraders, except when it comes to their own business.''   ``If there was some way tomorrow for the Japanese to set up acompetitive newspaper in Chicago and give the Tribune a run fortheir money, and they were subsidized by the (Japanese) government,guess who's side they'd be on?'' asked Saran. ``They'd probably beon the side of having the laws observed.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, March 26</NOTE></DOC>
