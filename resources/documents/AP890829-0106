KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Sen. Richard Lugar says President Oscar Ariasof Costa Rica, optimistic that Nicaragua's Marxist government can beremoved through free elections, favors continued U.S. humanitarianaid to the Contra rebels until they can be resettled peacefully.   Lugar also said he believes the profits of drug production anddistribution in nations such as Colombia, Peru and Bolivia are soenormous that the supply of narcotics probably cannot be shut offuntil demand for cocaine and other drugs in the United State isdramatically reduced.   The Indiana Republican, a ranking minority member of the SenateForeign Relations Committee, commented at a news conference as hereviewed his impressions of a 14-day, nine-nation trip through LatinAmerica.   Reporting on his visit to Costa Rica, Lugar said: ``PresidentArias told me he favors continuation of American humanitarian aid tothe Contras through the Nicaraguan elections (next February) andperhaps after that.''   Lugar said that when family members are taken into consideration,some 60,000 to 70,000 people are either Contra members or closelyassociated with them.   Arias believes that re-integrating so large a group intoNicaraguan society or settling them elsewhere will be difficult andtime consuming and that they will have to be supported until theirfuture is secured, Lugar said.   Arias ``believes the majority of them will be integrated, but itwill be difficult,'' Lugar said.   Lugar noted that the agreement reached earlier this year by thepresidents of five Central American nations calling for thedisbanding of the Contras by December is purely voluntary on thepart of the rebels.   Arias, the principal architect of the accord, also stressed theneed for the United States and nations in Latin America and WesternEurope to go into Nicaragua to boost voter confidence that theFebruary elections will be held and that a non-Sandinista presidentcan be elected president, Lugar said.   ``He said polls taken by Costa Ricans in Nicaragua show that aunified opposition would defeat'' the Sandinistas, ``and he isoptimistic that could happen,'' Lugar said.   ``The Nicaraguans have to get over a psychic block that leadsthem to believe that either nothing will happen or that electionswill not make a difference,'' Lugar added.   He said Arias hopes to give the process a boost at aninternational conference in San Jose in October marking the 100thanniversary of democracy in Costa Rica, noting that President Bushplans to attend.   The five Central American presidents will meet in Managua, theNicaraguan capital, in December. Arias hopes that also will helppromote the elections process, Lugar said.   Lugar said he found the narcotics situation in countries such asColombia and Peru difficult, complicated and ``truly depressing.''   He said U.S. officials estimate that 450 square miles of Peruvianfarm land is in coca production with Peruvian officials estimatingthe total as twice that.   Coca paste is the basic ingrediant of cocaine and Lugar said itis hard to imagine what crops could be substituted that would bringin a quarter of the narcotics profits now being pumped into theinflation-ravaged Peruvian economy.   In Colombia, Lugar said it is essential the United Statesstrengthen a government that is under siege by narcotics cartels inthe aftermath of the assassination of a leading presidentialcandidate.   Eradicating the flow of narcotics into the United States dependson drying up demand among Americans using drugs, Lugar said.   ``We should be discouraging first users and casual users andrehabilitating addicts,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
