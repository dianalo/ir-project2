 But either side of the Atlantic,funds much  prefer to invest in  management buyouts than  in greenfieldstart-ups  - and the progress so  far in less than a year  of theintriguingly-named SQL Systems seems to suggest some of the reasons why.andO;Janice  McGinn reports.andM;SQL Systems International BV has not been standing still since it raised #2min venture capital funding from Advent Ltd, Euro-Ventures Benelux and CreditLyonnais in March last year (CI No 1,142), in return for a mere 16% of itsshares.andP;  It is now the holding company for several relational database andcomputer-aided software engineering-oriented companies - SQL Software Ltd inHarlow, Essex; Asystum BV of Rotterdam; and SQL Systems Ltd of Chertsey,Surrey.andP;  The company also owns 40% of the Ashford, Kent-based ResourceManagement Systems which was set up in 1981 to develop a maintenancemanagement system called Rapier.andP;  Resource Management took off in 1984 whenOracle Corp advertised for resellers.andM;Household namesandM;It was the only company to respond to the advertisement and subsequentlybecame Oracle's first value added reseller in the UK.andP;  SQL owns the productrights to Rapier Version 4 but has modified the original system, targetedlargely at departmental level, to an asset management system aimed atcorporations.andP;  SQL and Resource Management Systems include household nameslike Unilever, Marconi, ICI, and British Rail in their client list, andHeineken Breweries in Holland and Singapore have an Ingres version running ona VAX and Hewlett-Packard HP9000.andP;  Asystum BV, based in Rotterdam, forms thecontinental headquarters for the SQL group.andP;  Now a wholly owned subsidiary,it was established several years ago, and operated both as a consultancy anddistributor for Resource Management's Rapier product.andP;  SQL Software, based inHarlow, describes itself as the technical products division of SQLInternational.andP;  Its primary offering is PCMS, a product configurationmanagement system, and it also develops and sells computer aided softwareengineering tools.andP;  The company was established in 1988 in a managementbuyout of Alcatel NV's UK Engineering Support Centre.andP;  Alcatel decided tocentralise its telecommunications operations in Paris after acquiring thebusiness from ITT Corp, but a number of UK staff declined to cross theChannel.andP;  Given the substantial investment that had been made in thedivision, and efficacy of the configuration management system and developmenttools, Alcatel and SQL reached an agreement whereby the management teamacquired the assets, and Alcatel kept the technology and tools.andP;  The mainfunctions of the PCMS include parallel development and active control,control plans, product design, change management, build and releasemanagement, and baselining.andP;  The first differentiates between the same itemsand enables project teams to be at work on parallel developments of thatsuite.andP;  Active control is provided via the product manager by assigning andre-assigning roles within the project as the life-cycle progresses, andchanges in life cycle are broadcast to users directly affected.andP;  Controlplans contain rules defining which elements need to be controlled, and howand by which mechanisms control takes place.andP;  These mechanisms are embodiedin life-cycles, and associated with role titles which the product managerassigns and changes during the life-cycle.andP;  The third function is to describeeach part within a system until there is a complete catalogue of productdesign.andP;  Design provides the structure against which the fourth and fifthfunctions are performed, change and release management.andP;  Change managementprovides for the capture of fault reports, change requests, and any othersort of change related information, including those planned for the future.andO;Build and release management breaks down the building of of product itemsinto a series of operations and constructs a tree relationship, with an itemprocessor applied to each branch.andP;  The release management system exports aproduct configuration from the PCMS en-vironment to user directories.andP;  Thelast function is baselining and it enables specific states of a product to becaptured and frozen, or eventually restructured.andP;  Chertsey-based SQL Systemshas recently been collaborating with British Airways, now one of the top 10property companies in the UK, on a new property and estate management system.andO;Called PROPS, the system is based on Rapier, and runs on an IBM 3090processor under VM and Oracle's relational database.andP;  It was developedspecifically for British Airways and the first two modules, estate andmaintenance, have been installed for the airline's Property Division.andM;US connectionsandM;The next two modules, financial project reporting and personnel management,are being jointly developed by British Airways and SQL, but they will beinstalled by an in-house technology team.andP;  British Airways funded PROPSdevelopment work and owns the rights to the software licence.andP;  It will marketPROPS to other airlines via the Airline Information Systems Marketingdivision in Hounslow, Middlesex, and SQL is looking to customise the systemfor industrial and banking applications.andP;  Tani Haque, who headed themanagement buyout from Alcatel and acts as SQL's group technical director,believes that Advent Ltd was a particularly wise choice of backer since ithas strong US connections.andP;  He says that once the 100-employee company isfirmly established in Europe, he would like to see it gain a foothold in theenticing US market, either by establishing a relationship with a distributor,or by acquisition.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
