Walker in Manhattan when he pleaded guiltyWednesday to a single count of wire fraud.   Dillon, who had worked in Merrill Lynch andamp; Co.'s New London,Conn. branch, was the first person to face criminal charges as aresult of a federal probe into insider trading on Business Week's``Inside Wall Street'' columns.   Dillon, who was fired by Merrill Lynch, already has pleadedguilty to a separate wire fraud charge in federal court inConnecticut, under an agreement with the government.   U.S. Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani stated that Dillon has beencooperating in a continuing investigation of insider trading basedon advance knowledge of securities to be mentioned in Business Week.   Last month, federal prosecutors charged that Dillon earned$94,000 in illicit profits on trades of approximately 129securities as part of the scheme, in which he would buyundistributed copies of Business Week for as little as $20 eachfrom a worker at a plant where the magazine was printed.   Dillon, who faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison anda $250,000 fine for each fraud count, will be sentenced March 7. Hewas released on his own recognizance.   Several stockbrokers are under investigation in connection withthe Business Week scandal and others have resigned or beendismissed. In addition, R.R. Donnelley andamp; Sons Co., Business Week'sprinter, has fired or disciplined several workers.</TEXT></DOC>
