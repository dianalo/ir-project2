And while we all mustgive our full support to the relief efforts, we should notethat 40,000 is also the number of children in the world whodie every day from chronic malnutrition and preventabledisease. The earthquake in Iran is apparently the first since1976 (the eighth in this century) to equal or exceed the24-hour death toll of children in our world from malnutritionand disease.   The generous outpouring of media coverage and monetarygifts directed to the victims in Iran is testimony to aheartening new level of public compassion and concern. Yetour concern is awakened only for sudden emergencies inlimited geographic areas. We have not yet fully awakened tothe unparalleled tragedy of malnutrition and disease, norhave we recognized the low-cost opportunities to cut in halfthe resulting death toll of 40,000 a day.</LP><TEXT>   On Sept. 29 and 30, the World Summit for Children willallow our leaders to address these opportunities fully. Thepotential of the summit is to save the lives of 50 millionchildren during this decade. On Sept. 23, thousands ofcitizens will voice their support for the summit in 180candlelight vigils in 16 countries. All who wish toparticipate should call 1-800-WE AGREE.
