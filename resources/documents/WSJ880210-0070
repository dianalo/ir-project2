He took only 19% of the vote, a sharp drop from the 32% he carried home in 1980. It is a shock that a sitting vice president could lose so badly not only to winner Bob Dole but also to a political newcomer like Pat Robertson. Obituaries for the Bush effort are premature, but clearly his Iowa campaign was on the wrong track.    Senator Dole won because he was able to convince many Iowans that, as a fellow Midwesterner, he was most familiar with rural issues. He also never failed to remind Iowans that he was the prime mover behind the 1985 Farm Bill, which has ballooned the cost of farm subsidies to a piggish $26 billion a year -- some $4 billion alone to Iowa farmers, both family and corporate.    On other issues Senator Dole is a mainstream Republican, certainly the least Reaganite of the GOP field. Even in centrist Iowa, the Dole totals were exceeded easily by the combined vote for Mr. Robertson, Jack Kemp and Pete du Pont -- all more ideologically conservative. In the nomination race the issues and emotions that propelled Ronald Reagan into the presidency are still a potentially decisive force.    The vice president's mistake in Iowa was to run as heir to Ronald Reagan the President, not Ronald Reagan the candidate. He counted on the aura of association with the President to let him avoid staking out bold positions of his own. His political organizers in Iowa concede that their TV commercials were largely recitations of the candidate's resume and failed to excite the electorate. The news coverage concentrated on the Iran-Contra affair and the tussle with Dan Rather, but Iowa already was saturated with commercials celebrating the INF treaty and showing Mr. Bush shaking hands with Mikhail Gorbachev.    Mr. Bush now has a week to set matters straight before the New Hampshire primary. He belatedly has staked out a fruitful theme of confrontation with Congress, and has commercials in the can that indict Congress as the prime culprit behind runaway budget spending and then call for a presidential line-item veto. He has six days to saturate the airwaves with that kind of message.    In New Hampshire, where the state motto is &quot;Live Free or Die,&quot; Republicans are different from those in Iowa. Over 50% of them, for example, voted for Ronald Reagan in the 1980 primary. The registration laws inhibit any surge of new pro-Robertson voters. The man with the momentum is Rep. Kemp, pulling to within two points of Senator Dole in the latest Boston Globe poll, partly because of ads painting the Senate minority leader as soft on tax increases. Rep. Kemp's support of tax cuts and skepticism about the Russians enable him to lay claim to being heir to the first six years of the Reagan administration, not the seventh one.    The challenge to Vice President Bush is clear enough. Many conservatives long have suspected that the vice president never really accepted the Reagan political agenda. The next week will determine if George Bush can convince the people who put Ronald Reagan on the road to the White House in 1980 that he truly shares their values. </TEXT></DOC>
