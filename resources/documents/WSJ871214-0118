Specifically, he denies having testified that the probability of a one-day, 500-point decline in the Dow, such as occurred on Oct. 19, was &quot;remote.&quot;    On page 41 of the published hearing record for the SEC's budget authorization on May 13, 1987, Sen. Donald W. Riegle noted that several people close to the securities markets were publicly expressing concern over the possibility of a market &quot;meltdown.&quot; Sen. Riegle inquired of then SEC Chairman Shad what his opinion was of the probability of a 500-point drop in one day. Chairman Shad replied, and I quote from page 42 of the record, &quot;In terms of probabilities of a 1-day break of 500 points in the Dow Jones average? I would say I think it's highly remote, very remote.&quot; This was the statement that I attributed to Chairman Shad and I stand by it based on the cited hearing record.    In his letter, Ambassador Shad asserts that his only prediction of a market event, which he characterized as a &quot;remote&quot; possibility, involved whether the market could conceivably decline 90%.
