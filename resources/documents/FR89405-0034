The proposed rule will update legal citations and establisha new, streamlined, system of procedures for implementing the Job Corpsprogram. <ITAG tagnum="84">The Job Corps Program </ITAG>The Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA or the Act) was enacted in 1982to establish programs to prepare youth and unskilled adults for entry intothe labor force and to afford job training to those economically disadvantagedindividuals and other individuals facing serious barriers to employment,who are in special need of such training to obtain productive employment.Public Law 97-300, 96 Stat. 1322 (October 12, 1982), as amended; 29 U.S.C.1501 <T3>et seq. </T3>JTPA replaced and repealed the prior Comprehensive Employmentand Training Act (CETA). Pub. L. 93-203, 87 Stat. 839 (December 28, 1973),as amended. JTPA 184(a)(1). The Job Corps, authorized under Title IV-B of JTPA, is a national programfor economically disadvantaged young men and women. 29 U.S.C. 1691-1709.Originally established by Title I-A of the Economic Opportunity Act of1964, Pub. L. 88-452, 78 Stat. 508 (August 20, 1964), the Job Corps programwas continued under Title IV of CETA and thereupon by JTPA Title IV-B.Residential and nonresidential Job Corps centers throughout the countryprovide corpsmembers with intensive programs of education, vocational training(including pre-apprenticeship training), work experience, and other activities.See 29 U.S.C. 1698. The Job Corps assists eligible young individuals whoneed and can benefit from an intensive program, operated in a group setting,to become more responsible, employable, and productive citizens; and todo so in a way that contributes, where feasible, to the development ofnational, State, and community resources, and to the development and disseminationof techniques for working with the disadvantaged that can be widely utilizedby public and private institutions and agencies. 29 U.S.C. 1691. Job Corps centers are operated by a variety of organizations, both publicand private. Many centers are operated under contract with private-for-profitand private nonprofit organizations, State and local government entities,Native American entities, community-based organizations, and JTPA recipients.Contract centers vary in size. 29 U.S.C. 1697.Civilian Conservation Centers (CCCs) are Job Corps Centers operated bythe Department of Interior and the Department of Agriculture under interagencyagreements with DOL. CCCs are small centers located on public lands, primarilyin southern and northwestern States. 29 U.S.C. 1697. The Job Corps previously had been authorized under CETA, and, therefore,the Job Corps regulations currently are published at 20 CFR Part 684, amongthe old CETA regulations. See 44 FR 64290 (November 6, 1979); see also29 CFR Part 97a (1976), 40 FR 50812 (October 31, 1975). However, with theenactment of JTPA almost six years ago, and based on the experience ofthe agency in administering the program, DOL proposes to revise the JobCorps regulations and redesignate them as a new 20 CFR Part 638, amongthe JTPA regulations. Some specific features of the proposed rule are describedbelow. <ITAG tagnum="84">Administrative Provisions </ITAG>Because the Job Corps utilizes contractors to operate centers and, unlikeJTPA Titles I, II, and III programs, does not use grants to Governors (andthus does not provide funds through Governors to JTPA service deliveryareas) for this purpose, the majority of the JTPA regulations coveringadministrative provisions of the Act (20 CFR Part 636) do not apply tothe Job Corps program. Those which do apply are cited below in SubpartA of proposed Part 638. Other regulations affecting the governing and administrationof the Job Corps program are cited elsewhere in proposed Part 638. <ITAG tagnum="84">Policy and Requirements Handbook </ITAG>While no major programmatic or policy changes are included in the proposedrule, the method of implementing Job Corps program requirements and proceduresis affected. Proposed andSection; 638.100 provides for the issuance of a<T3>Job Corps Policy and Requirements Handbook </T3>(Handbook). The Handbookwill be incorporated by reference into each contract or agreement to operatea Job Corps center, program, or entity, and will contain policy and requirementsnecessary for, and appropriate to, the administration and management ofthe Job Corps program. Subject areas to be covered by the Handbook include: Outreach and screening Placement, Educational Program, Vocational Training,Corpsmember Support, Health Services, Residential Living, Administrationand Management, Facilities Security and Related Subjects, Financial Management,Procurement, Property Management, and Subcontracting for Contract Centers,Nondiscrimination. These areas cover all aspects of Job Corps program operations and correspondwith language in the proposed rule alluding to procedures to be establishedor issued by the Job Corps Director. Such procedures are currently includedin the Job Corps regulations at 20 CFR Part 684 (1987). The overall effectwill be to streamline regulations and enhance program flexibility. <ITAG tagnum="84">Technical Corrections and Other Clarifying Rules </ITAG>DOL is taking this opportunity to update and clarify the Job Corps regulationsby deleting references to CETA. References to new or revised requirementsunder JTPA are inserted. Also, editorial changes are also made (<T3>e.g.</T3>, nomenclature revisions, simplification of language, deletionof repetitive references). <ITAG tagnum="84">Taxation </ITAG>The Job Training Partnership Act Amendments of 1986, Pub. L. 99-496 section12, 100 Stat. 1261, 1264 (October 16, 1986), amended section 437(c) ofthe Act relating to taxation of Job Corps operations. The amendment wasto ensure that all Job Corps activities and transactions authorized underTitle IV-B of the Act which are carried out pursuant to contracts withthe Secretary by either for-profit or non-profit Job Corps contractorsare exempted from all State gross receipts, excise, sales, use, businessprivilege, or similar taxes (such as occupational taxes) measured by grossreceipts. ``Joint Explanatory Statement of Compromise Agreement on S. 2069,''132 Cong. Rec. H8809 (October 1, 1986). The language of section 437(c)of the Act, as amended, therefore is reflected in proposed andSection; 638.812below.<ITAG tagnum="84">Legal Fees </ITAG>Similar to the current regulations at 20 CFR 684.91, the proposed 20 CFR638.534 below provides for the payment of legal fees for corpsmembers undercertain circumstances. The proposed rule gives the Job Corps Director (andthe Job Corps Director's designees) greater flexibility and discretionwith respect to such assistance and the level of such assistance. However, pursuant to section 105 of the Department of Labor AppropriationsAct, 1989, Pub. L. 100-436, notwithstanding the regulations, the Job Corpscurrently will not pay the expenses of legal counsel or representationin any criminal case or proceeding for a Job Corps participant, unlesscertified to and approved by the Secretary of Labor that a public defenderis not available. The Secretary, through the Assistant Secretary for Employmentand Training, has designated the Job Corps Director to make such certificationsand approvals. The Job Corps Director will issue instructions to Job Corpsoffices and center operators to implement the appropriations provision.<ITAG tagnum="84">Claims for Losses </ITAG>A two-year time limit has been added for all claims for losses, damage,and theft. This is consistent with Federal Tort Claims Act procedures,and permits the expeditious handling of claims. <ITAG tagnum="84">Redesignation Table </ITAG>The table below provides a ``crosswalk'' between current and proposed JobCorps regulations. Where reference is made to deleted sections or procedures,in most cases corresponding requirements and procedures will be issuedby the Job Corps Director, as appropriate, in the <T3>Job Corps Policy and Requirements Handbook</T3>.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Redesignation Table*</T4><H1>Current Regs.
