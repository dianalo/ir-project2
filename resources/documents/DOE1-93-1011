TEM photographs of the interfacial region between thesemiconducting layer and the insulation layer in the disc specimens weretaken after its breakdown test in order to observe the lamella structurein the interfacial region. Lamella seems to start near a carbon particleof 30 - 100 nm in diameter and its direction is perpendicular to thesurface of the carbon particle. Lamella structure neat the interfaceis affected clearly by the existence of semiconducting layer within 200- 300 nm from the surface. The average lamella angle among lamella within200 nm from the interface closely correlated to the 10% weibull breakdownstrength. It is found that the smaller the angle decreases, the higherthe breakdown increases. (34 figs, 10 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
