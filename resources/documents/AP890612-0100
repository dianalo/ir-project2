The two-day meeting of 50 nations is aimed at ``relieving thegrowing frustration of both countries of first asylum andresettlement countries,'' said the office of the U.N. HighCommissioner for Refugees.   Fourteen years after the Vietnam War ended, more than 1.2 millionVietnamese have been resettled, the majority in the United States.Most of the resettlement occurred after a 1979 Geneva conference ontheir plight.   Since 1986, resettlement has lagged behind the rate at whichrefugees continue to flee Vietnam undeterred by the dangers, whichinclude attacks by pirates who rape and murder.   Many Western resettlement countries, also confronted with growingnumbers of would-be immigrants from other regions, have reduced thenumber of people they will accept.   Last year, foreign ministers of the Association of South EastAsian Nations _ Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,Singapore and Thailand _ called for a comprehensive solution to theproblem of refugees from Indochina.   The flow continued to increase and Hong Kong has borne the brunt.In 1988, it stopped granting automatic refugee status to all boatpeople.   Most refugees now come from northern Vietnam, often throughChina, where many buy small boats for the final part of the journey.   In May alone, Hong Kong's population of refugees andasylum-seekers increased by one third _ nearly 9,000, more than thetotal arrivals in all other coastal states of the region.   Those accepted as refugees get work permits in the Britishcolony, where the legal minimum monthly salary is equal to about 2{years' pay for a worker in Vietnam.   Under the policy adopted in June 1988, Hong Kong treats boatpeople as illegal immigrants and ``economic refugees'' unless theycan prove they fled political persecution. About nine of 10 arebeing refused refugee status.   After the number of refugees landing in the Philippines tripled,authorities announced screening procedures in March and said allpeople who could not prove political persecution would be sent back.   Singapore refuses to let people ashore if they arrive in theirown boats. News reports say boats have been forced back to sea atgunpoint along the Thai coast.   Screening is only one element in a six-page draft plan to beconsidered at the Geneva conference, which also includes an expandedresettlement program. It relies on an international ``mediacampaign'' to publicize the dangers and disadvantages of escaping byboat and the benefits of regular emigration programs.   The plan urges that Vietnamese refused refugee status beencouraged to return home, and stipulates: ``If, after the passageof reasonable time, it becomes clear that voluntary repatriation isnot making sufficient progress ... alternatives recognized as beingacceptable under international practices would be examined.''   Only 143 Vietnamese have volunteered to go home since Marchdespite assurances from Hanoi that they can return safely. Manypeople involved with the refugee program doubt a substantialincrease in the rate is possible.   The Hong Kong chapter of the Oxfam relief agency supportsforcible return, combined with Western encouragement of more openpolicies by Vietnam and help in developing the country's economy.   At the conference, the United States is expected to leadopposition to forcible repatriation. Vietnamese refugees living inseveral Western countries arrived in Geneva to urge delegates totreat the boat people ``with humanity.''   ``Sending them back to hell from which they managed to escape ... would be totally inhuman,'' said a petition a French-basedcommittee claimed was signed by 20,000 Vietnamese emigres in thepast two weeks.</TEXT></DOC>
