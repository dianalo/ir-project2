The torrential rains ended Thursday, and officials said riverembankments had burst at 17 places, washing away mud-and-strawhouses in at least 100 villages. They said floods had affected some250,000 people.   The area most severely hit was the tea-growing Zakiganj area inSylhet district, 120 miles northeast of Dhaka, a Relief Ministryofficial said.   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said at least10 people died of diarrhea in Zakiganj in the last three days. Atleast 1,000 others were affected by the disease caused by dirtydrinking water, he said.   News reports reaching Dhaka said at least 150 people died in theZakiganj area as a result of the rains in the past two weeks.   The government has sent 12 medical teams to Zakiganj.   ``The situation is quite alarming. We are trying our best toevacuate the marooned people, but we don't have enoughspeedboats,'' said an official who visited the area Friday.   Many people were stranded on roofs with floodwaters around them,and some had built makeshift bamboo platforms, he said.   ``Many people have grain, but they have no dry place to cook,''he said.   The Flood Forecasting Center said water was receding in theKushiara River in Zakiganj but was still above the danger level.   Flooding is an annual problem in this impoverished nation of 110million. More than 1,400 people were killed last year in floodsthat submerged three-fourths of the country.</TEXT></DOC>
