The suit, filed by the California attorney general and 18other states, was dismissed in 1989 by federal Judge WilliamSchwarzer. The action was considered a major test of theindustry's special status under federal antitrust law andsymbolized the broad national backlash against skyrocketinginsurance rates.</LP><TEXT>   The states had asserted the companies conspired to limitliability coverage and drive up rates for businesses andgovernments, amounting to an illegal boycott that limited theavailability of liability insurance in the U.S. JudgeSchwarzer held that the actions of the companies didn'tamount to a boycott and were thus legal under the protectionsof the McCarran-Ferguson Act.   But a three-judge panel of the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court ofAppeals disagreed, clearing the way for a possible trial. Thedefendants include Aetna Casualty andamp; Surety Co.; AllstateInsurance Co., a unit of Sears, Roebuck and Co.; Hartford FireInsurance Co.; Cigna Corp.; and Lloyd's of London.   &quot;Obviously, we are very pleased. I think all of the stateshave spent an enormous amount of time and effort to move thecase along,&quot; said Thomas Greene, deputy California attorneygeneral. He said he fully expected the defendant companies toappeal the decision, but that meanwhile, &quot;We are very pleasedthat our characterization of the case was accepted by theNinth Circuit and that the court gave us a very stunningvictory.&quot;   &quot;This puts the case back in the trial court, where wethought it should be all along,&quot; he added.   The decision comes at a time of insurance regulationupheaval. California, for instance, passed a law shortlyafter the case was filed in 1988 that strips the industry ofits state antitrust immunity, and other states and federalauthorities are reexamining the antitrust issue. Texasrecently settled a similar suit in which it accused theindustry of anti-competitive practices in state court.   McCarran-Ferguson, which Congress enacted in 1944, exemptsthe &quot;business of insurance&quot; from antitrust prosecution,provided the states regulate it. The immunity, however,specifically excludes acts of &quot;boycott, coercion orintimidation.&quot;   The states alleged that the Insurance Services OfficesInc., a trade group based in New York, succumbed to pressurefrom a small group of member companies in 1984 and rewroteindustry-wide policy standards to exclude coverage forpollution damages and other risks. The suits contend theexclusions precipitated a national crisis and amount to anillegal boycott.   The insurance defendants contend that their actions,however collusive, amounted to merely conferring and agreeingon terms on which insurance would be offered, which the lawpermits.   &quot;The case is based on a fundamentally false premise thatthere was some conspiracy to force purchasers of insurance toaccept a claims-made form, when in fact, the claims-made formwas a failure in the marketplace,&quot; said Richard de SaintPhalle, an Oakland, Calif., attorney, who is liaison counselfor the defendants. Under a &quot;claims-made&quot; form, only claimsmade during the life of a policy are paid; by contrast, formsinsuring against &quot;occurrences&quot; of liability leave insurersopen to claims long after a policy has expired.   &quot;These attorneys general have to go back and put on acase. We don't think they will be successful. The facts donot bear out their own erroneous legal theories,&quot; added Mr.de Saint Phalle, who said the industry hasn't decided uponits next step in the litigation.</TEXT></DOC>
