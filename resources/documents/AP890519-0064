Manuel Antonio Noriega made hisfirst public appearance since the nullified May 7 elections beforea cheering crowd, but he had nothing to say about his country'scrisis or his future plans.   Noriega was greeted with roars and chants by the more than 1,200military, government and party workers who gathered Thursday night,but he gave no speech and made few comments to reporters.   ``I'm fine,'' Panama's de facto ruler said repeatedly when askedhow he had held up in the tension-filled weeks since May 7.   When asked how much longer he could go on, he laughed and said,``That's a good question.''   The elections were nullified by a government tribunal even asinternational observers said opposition candidate Guillermo Endarawas leading Noriega's handpicked candidate 3-1.   Noriega, commander of the Panamanian Defense Forces, has beenaccused of ordering the beatings of opposition candidates May 10.   At the rally, Noriega supporters watched a series of traditionalmusic and dance mixed with anti-American skits, poetry and arecitation of U.S. interventions in Panama.   ``With Noriega to the Year 2000,'' signs declared. Members ofthe crowd said they were members of the government party orgovernment workers, or both.   ``We came voluntarily, we weren't forced,'' said one woman, whorefused to give her name but said she worked in a hospital laundryin Colon, 50 miles north of Panama City. She said she was bused inafter work.   She and her friends joined in a chant of ``Noriega, for sure,hit the Yankees hard!'' which rhymes in Spanish.   Noriega was pursued by a pack of journalists as he left theconvention center but did little more than smile in reply torepeated requests for a message to Bush or to the Organization ofAmerican States.   Bush and the OAS have condemned election fraud and repression,and the OAS is sending a committee of foreign ministers to reporton the situation in Panama.   News media run by the Noriega regime denounced Wednesday night'sOAS resolution condemning Noriega.   In an interview with WBAI Radio early Thursday in New York,Noriega declared that the United States was persecuting Panama``because we are black.''   In other interview comments, Noriega repeated his frequentassertions that the U.S. Embassy in Panama is misinforming theWhite House and that the United States was engaged in aggression.   Noriega was indicted on drug smuggling and money launderingcharges in Florida in February 1988. Washington and the localopposition since then have mounted a concerted campaign against himto no avail.   Noriega denies the drug accusations. He and his supporterscontend the United States has slandered him as part of a scheme torenege on its commitments under the 1977 Panama Canal Treaties.   The pacts oblige Washington to hand over complete control of thewaterway to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999.</TEXT></DOC>
