(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A drifter accused of killing two peopleon a municipal bus was arrested Wednesday in Nebraska as he lungedfor the suspected murder weapon in a car stolen from the shootingscene, police said.   In Nebraska, Keith County Judge Lloyd Kaufman set bond forJoseph Alexander Besaraba, 44, at $1 million in a hearing bytelephone. Arraignment was expected Thursday in Ogallala.   He was being held on a Florida arrest warrant in Sunday's busshooting, as well as suspicion of attempted assault on a peaceofficer and possession of a stolen vehicle in Nebraska, bothfelonies, said Keith County Attorney Deborah Gilg.   Besaraba was found sleeping in the back seat of a car besideInterstate 80 near Brule, Neb., said Hollywood police spokesmanDavid Steele.   Keith County sheriff's officers investigated the parked carbecause the vehicle lacked a front license plate, Steele said. Suchplates are required on Nebraska vehicles, although front platesaren't issued in Florida.   Besaraba was asked to get out of the car while officers ran alicense check, and they learned the vehicle had been stolen inFlorida.   As officers took him into custody, Besaraba dove into the car toreach for a 9mm German Luger, ``which has been described as themurder weapon through witnesses at the crime scene,'' saidHollywood police Sgt. Darron Castiglione.   Officers subdued the man, found identification in the car andtook him to the Keith County Jail, Steele said.   Besaraba was wearing the same plaid shirt and blue jeansdescribed by shooting witnesses and carried $500 in traveler'schecks purchased in Miami six days before the shooting, Castiglionesaid.   Two Hollywood detectives left for Nebraska to interviewBesaraba, a naturalized American citizen who came to the UnitedStates from Ballendorf, West Germany, in 1970.   He was accused of boarding a municipal bus in Hollywood andfatally shooting driver Sydney Granger and passenger Wesley B.Anderson with a 9mm semiautomatic pistol.   Besaraba then allegedly commandeered a getaway car, criticallywounding driver Scott Yaguda, 31, a bakery manager from Alexandria,Va., with gunshots to his back and legs. Yaguda was in stablecondition at Hollywood's Memorial Hospital, said spokeswomanCynthia Wine.   The Florida warrant charges Besaraba with two counts offirst-degree murder, one of attempted first-degree murder and armedrobbery.   He was described in Florida as a drifter who stuffed his pocketswith cash earned by participating in medical research projects. Healso frequented libraries _ his photograph was recognized bylibrary workers in Fort Lauderdale and Hollywood.</TEXT></DOC>
