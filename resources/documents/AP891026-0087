(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jim Bakker seems to be adapting to alifestyle much different from the one he lived as the leader of amultimillion-dollar religious empire.   Instead of silk, the PTL founder wears an orange jumpsuit, andhe changed more luxurious quarters for a cell shared with anotherinmate.   Still, ``he was in good spirits this morning when I met withhim,'' said Brian Ross, a spokesman at the medium-securityTalladega Federal Correctional Institution where Bakker onWednesday served the first full day of his 45-year sentence.   The minister's mother said her son was wrongly imprisoned.   ``They treated Jim like he was a dog,'' said Bakker's mother,Furnia, in a telephone interview today from her home on the groundsof Heritage USA at Fort Mill, S.C. ``We've been through a lot, butthis is the worst.''   She said she cannot stop thinking of her son. ``I can't believemy son is in prison,'' Mrs. Bakker said.   ``My husband (Raleigh Bakker) just went to the doctor,'' shesaid. ``This is awfully hard on both of us. We're both 83 and thisis hard to take.''   Bakker arrived at the facility Tuesday night in handcuffs andshackles after a six-hour drive from Charlotte, N.C., where afederal judge banished him immediately to prison after imposing thesentence and a $500,000 fine.   Bakker was convicted Oct. 5 of defrauding thousands of followersof his television ministry.   ``He's settling in,'' Ross said. ``He's adjusting and becomingfamiliar with his surroundings. He's doing fine.''   Two former Bakker aides are being held at another federal prisonin Alabama. Brothers James and David Taggart reported Wednesday toa Montgomery lockup to begin serving more than 17 years for taxevasion.   Bakker was assigned to a two-man cell. Prison officials wouldnot reveal his cellmate's identity.   Ross said Bakker made some telephone calls Wednesday morning andexercised. He would not disclose if Bakker had spoken with hiswife, Tammy Faye Bakker, or other family members.   The Bakkers' new television ministry in Orlando, Fla., has beensuspended, but the storefront church they had been running in ashopping mall remains open. Mrs. Bakker and guest ministers wereexpected to conduct Sunday services.   Mrs. Bakker, who did not attend Tuesday's sentencing, wasstaying with friends in the Orlando area and did not make herselfavailable to reporters.   Ross said he met with Bakker Wednesday morning to relay numerousmedia requests for interviews, which Bakker referred to hisattorney in North Carolina.   Bakker's lawyer, Harold Bender, said prejudicial pretrialpublicity will be the key issue on appeal, which he filed Tuesday.   Moreover, he said, Bakker's sentence is excessive. ``We believebecause of his celebrity status that the sentence was in the rangethat it was,'' he told CBS News Wednesday.   Ross said no additional security measures were planned duringBakker's stay at the prison, which often is the first stop forprisoners in the Southeast. He is expected to stay there no morethan two weeks before he is transferred to another federal prison,which officials declined to reveal.   Ross said Bakker's family and attorneys can visit the defrockedTV evangelist for three evenings during the week and all day onweekends. Bakker also will be able to attend religious services onSunday.</TEXT></DOC>
