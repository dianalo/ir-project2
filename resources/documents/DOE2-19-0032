Such dipersantmixing has been suggested as an interim treatment measure in case ofa remote Arctic oil spill from a tanker. The experimental tank lengthwas a tenth of the length of anticipated full sized tanks. The gas bubbleplume was created by air exiting from a line source at the bottom oftanks filled with water. Fluorescein dye was used in the tanks to tracethe mixing. From samples of tank fluid collected during the experiments,the average dye concentration variation was calculated and used to describethe amount of mixing left to be completed. Through dimensional analysisit was determined that the Froude number was the most important dimensionlessgroup and the independent variables of the system were defined. The resultingchange in mixture during the experiments as the independent variableswere varied was noted. The data was nondimensionalized and plotted inlog-log form so that a straight line could be fitted through the points.To fit the data, the slope of the line increases when the fluid reachesa partially mixed state. An exponential relationship between averageconcentration variation and mixing time was derived. Dispersant mixingtimes in full sized tanks containing crude oil are predicted. Experimentswith oil and dispersant were conducted. The degree of mixing was measuredusing a radioactive tracer in the dispersant. No significant differenceswere noticed between oil mixing and water mixing for similar high Reynoldsnumbers. The dispersant concentration variations with time in light crude,agree with the mathematical model predictions. The model could not beused for a viscous oil such as cold Bunker. 3 refs., 29 figs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
