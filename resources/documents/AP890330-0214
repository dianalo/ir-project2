Amoco Production is the oil and gas exploration subsidiary ofAmoco Corp., the nation's fifth-largest energy company, andofficials say the reductions are designed to reduce costs andbetter focus resources.   The cuts announced Wednesday amount to about 10 percent of theU.S. employees, officials said.   The subsidiary has 15,000 workers worldwide, including about8,000 U.S. citizens who are paid in U.S. dollars no matter wherethey work, according to spokesman Richard Judy of Chicago-basedAmoco Corp.   The job cuts, slated to begin in May, would come throughplacement of employees with other Amoco Corp. subsidiaries,voluntary retirement, voluntary resignation and some firings, thecompany said.   The reductions will be made ``to reduce our costs and focus ourresources _ money, physical assets and people _ on those areaswhere the projected financial returns are the most attractive,''said Patrick J. Early, president of Amoco Production.   Early said the changes reflect general trends of shrinking thecompany's domestic organization while expanding internationaloperations.   For the first time in its 100-year history, Amoco plans to spendmore money in 1989 searching for oil and gas abroad than in theUnited States.   The company said it plans to take advantage of its strongnatural gas reserve position, look into property trades with othercompanies and continue divesting marginal and non-strategicproperties.   The reorganization of Amoco's U.S. exploration and productionoperations follows similar moves recently by Texaco Inc., AtlanticRichfield Co. and Phillips Petroleum Co.   ``The majors are looking in foreign areas because they've got abetter chance of finding a big field there,'' said Ray Beresford, aprincipal of International Energy Consultants Ltd. in Morristown,N.J.   ``The Lower 48 (states) is pretty well picked over, and the onlyhopes of a big field in the U.S. _ Alaska or offshore California _you can't touch'' because of environmental concerns, he said.   In the last year, U.S. oil production has dropped 5 percent.   Amoco Corp. and its subsidiaries employ 55,000 people worldwide.The energy and chemical company sold 6 percent of all refinedpetroleum products in the United States last year, and had 1988revenues of $23.9 billion, Judy said.</TEXT></DOC>
