The compromise is one of several the Senate BankingCommittee is pursuing to remove obstacles its banking billwill face when the Senate starts voting on the measure,perhaps today. The latest version of the House banking billalso drops the administration's proposals to broaden bankentry into the securities business.</LP><TEXT>   Last night, the House began its second attempt to pass abanking bill after failing last week, in part because ofdisagreement over how to allow banks into the securitiesbusiness. The House adopted on a voice vote provisions thatwould replenish the bank deposit insurance fund, tighten bankregulation, trim the scope of deposit insurance, and restrictthe Federal Reserve Board's ability to keep sick banks alivewith loans.   But the House delayed until today a vote on an amendmentto allow banks to branch nationwide and on final passage ofthe banking bill to give the House leadership and theadministration more time to drum up support for the bill.   House Speaker Thomas Foley (D., Wash.) is working hard towin passage of the bill in the face of significant oppositionfrom Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.), who believes the billshould include provisions imposing stiffer regulation onbanks in the securities business.   As in the House, the Senate is struggling to find acombination of provisions that will help win support for anunpopular bill that gives the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.a $70 billion line of credit from the Treasury to help itmeet the rising costs of bank failures. With the bank depositinsurance fund nearly out of money, &quot;It's essential that wemove forward with this legislation,&quot; Senate Banking CommitteeChairman Donald Riegle asserted. Adding pressure to act, theGeneral Accounting Office predicted yesterday that the BankInsurance Fund &quot;in all likelihood will be insolvent by Dec.31, 1991.&quot;   Another compromise will make it difficult for banks tosell insurance nationwide, while expanding the powers ofnational banks to sell insurance in 17 states, includingCalifornia, that currently allow state-chartered banks tosell insurance. The insurance industry, which has a powerfullobbying network, supports this deal as a way to blockCiticorp and other large banking organizations from usingtheir credit-card holders as a customer base for a nationwideinsurance business.   A third important compromise dealing with interstatebranch networks has been more elusive. The administration andlarge banks strongly back a provision that would allow banksto establish nationwide branch networks. Sen. Wendell Ford(D., Ky.) has put together a compromise that allows states toset the terms banks must meet to branch into the state. Butthe administration and Sen. Ford have reached a roadblock onhow the compromise would treat large foreign banks. Sen. Fordwants the branches of all foreign banks to operate under U.S.subsidiaries, while the Treasury argues that this wouldpenalize some large foreign banks that don't accept federallyinsured deposits -- those under $100,000.   Under the bank reform plan the Treasury proposed inFebruary, banks would have been allowed to offer a widerrange of financial services by expanding into the securitiesand insurance businesses. But the insurance and brokerageindustries have beaten back this proposal.   Insurers have won a reversal of recent court andregulatory decisions that would have allowed banks to sellinsurance nationwide. And in the House, the securitiesindustry succeeded in winning provisions that increased,rather than removed, restrictions on bank entry into thesecurities industry. As a result, the Treasury and thebanking industry have worked to strip all the securitiesprovisions from the banking bill.   &quot;We have to recognize the reality of the situation,&quot; saidSen. Jake Garn (R., Utah). &quot;We're not going to be able topass a comprehensive banking bill.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
