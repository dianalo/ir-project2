This investigationis part of the Athens Automation and Control Experiment sponsored bythe US Department of Energy, Office of Energy Storage and Distribution,Electric Energy Systems Program. In this experiment, distribution feederequipment on twelve feeders connected to three substations is being remotelycontrolled from a central dispatch center. A supervisory control anddata acquisition system provides substation and feeder monitoring andremote control of feeder circuit breakers, power reclosers, and loadbreak switches. An analytical study is presented to show the improvementin conventional distribution system reliability indices that are achievedat AUB as a function of the penetration of automation equipment. Thevalue of automation predicted by the study is highly sensitive to thehistorical outage data used in the analysis and to the economic worthof reliability assigned by the utility. These sensitivities are wellknown and account, at least in part, for the reluctance of some upperutility managers to invest in automation systems. Operating experiencewith the AUB automation system has shown that there are significant intangiblereliability benefits and tangible cost savings associated with automationthat are outside the scope of conventional distribution reliability indices.Eight case studies are described, from actual AUB operations, where theautomation system resulted in significant cost savings and reliabilitybenefits that are not captured by conventional reliability indices. Otherutilities should expect similar benefits, which will be difficult toquantify analytically but, which add to the value of and justificationfor distribtuion automation. 4 refs., 3 figs., 4 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
