The achievement of an air-mass-one (AM1),photo-to-dark conductivity ratio of 5.6 x 10{sup 5} with a rehydrogenateda-Si:H sample was reported earlier [Y. S. Tsuo, E. B. Smith, and S. K.Deb, Appl. Phys. Lett. 51, 1436 (1987)]. In this communication we reportrecent results of the rehydrogenation study and new results of a studyof the post-hydrogenation of amorphous silicon deposited by glow dischargeat 480 {sup 0}C. AM1 photo-to-dark conductivity ratios as high as 9.5x 10{sup 6} (with a photoconductivity of 8.6 x 10{sup -6} {Omega} cm{sup-1}) and 1.1 x 10{sup 5} (with a photoconductivity of 6.3 x 10{sup -6}{Omega} cm{sup -1}) have been obtained with a rehydrogenated sample anda post-hydrogenated sample, respectively. We also report the resultsof the hydrogen depth profile and photostability measurements of thesesamples.</TEXT></DOC>
