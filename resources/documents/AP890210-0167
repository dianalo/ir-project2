WILSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Vatican said Friday racism is a ``woundin humanity's side,'' citing apartheid in South Africa,anti-Semitism and the treatment of peasants and native peoples asslaves.   Apartheid received the harshest criticism. In a major document,the Vatican said it was ``the most marked and systematic form'' ofracism and economic sanctions against South Africa could bejustified.   The document, ``The Church and Racism: Towards A More FraternalSociety'' stressed, however, that one country should not be singledout because ``It would be hypocritical to point a finger at only onecountry: rejection based on race exists on every continent.''   It also criticized discrimination against religious minorities incountries governed by Islamic law and warned of ``apprenticesorcerers'' exploiting modern science in an effort to produce humanbeings selected by race.   Although the United States is one of the world's most interracialsocieties, it said, ``much still needs to be done'' to eliminateprejudice there.   Pope John Paul II had the Vatican's Justice and Peace Commissionprepare the document to help ``enlighten and awaken consciences.''Naming countries in the document was a departure from usual practice.   The commission said it was not trying to ``gloss over theweaknesses and even, at times, the complicity'' of the RomanCatholic Church in racism throughout history, and declared that thechurch ``wants first and foremost to change racist attitudes,including those within her own communities.''   Racism is a sin that blasphemes God, it said, and the churchencourages legislation, administrative measures and ``evenappropriate external pressure'' against it.   It can be eliminated only by going ``to its roots, where it isformed: in the human heart,'' the commission wrote. ``Racism stillexists and continually reappears in different forms. ... It is awound in humanity's side that mysteriously remains open.''   South Africa's apartheid policy of discrimination is``institutional racism,'' the document said. ``It is justified by anideology of the superiority of persons from European stock overthose of African or Indian origin or `colored,' which is, by some,supported by an erroneous interpretation of the Bible.   ``Today apartheid is the most marked and systematic form'' ofracism and ``change is absolutely necessary and urgent.''   ``Although some steps toward change have been taken in recentyears, the black majority ... remains excluded from effectiverepresentation in national government and enjoys citizenship in wordonly,'' it continued.   Cardinal Roger Etchegaray of France, head of the commisssion thatprepared the document, said it reflects his observations during atwo-week tour of South Africa last year.   At a news conference, he described apartheid as ``monstrous'' andadded that, while South Africa had made some reforms since 1978,``apartheid maintains untouched in its foundations.''   He cited laws that register people by race at birth, establishseparate living areas for different races and reserve most of theland for whites.   Etchegaray said the Vatican supports the South African bishops,who have said economic sanctions can be ``morally justified'' butshould be applied only on condition they do not destroy thecountry's economy and cause further suffering.   The document called anti-Semitism ``the most tragic form thatracist ideology has assumed in our century,'' referring to the Naziextermination of 6 million Jews.   ``Certain organizations, with branches in many countries, keepalive the anti-Semite racist myth, with the support of networks ofpublications,'' it said.   It cited terrorist attacks against Jewish people and symbols, andsaid anti-Zionism ``serves at times as a screen for anti-Semitism,feeding on it and leading to it.''   Discrimination against aboriginal people and immigrants, andexploitation of poor peasants by powerful landowners, ``are newforms of slavery which are frequent in the Third World,'' thedocument said.   The report said the world should not forget other massexterminations, such as those of Armenians after World War I andCambodians in the 1970s, and urged the revision of history textsthat ``falsify history, pass over the historical misdeeds of racismin silence or justify the principles behind it.''</TEXT></DOC>
