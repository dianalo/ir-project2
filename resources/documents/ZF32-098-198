In it, you'll find somebeginning OOP concepts as well as a useable demo version of Actor,Whitewater's full featured OOP language.andM;Whitewater Group is one of the big players in the Windows development toolworld by virtue of their Windows Resource Toolkit (WRT).andP;  This tool createsWindows resources such as dialog boxes and pull down menus.andP;  Since Windowsdoesn't care what language is used when it calls a Resource, the WRT can beused with both Microsoft's SDK and Borland's C++.andP;  In fact, Borland has sucha high opinion of it, they bundle WRT with every copy of their new C++.andM;Whitewater Group made a splash this spring by selling Actor, which normallylists for $249, at a promo price of $99.andP;  The success of this promotion saysa lot about the programming tools market.andP;  There must be 100 programmers whoWANT to learn Object Oriented Programming for every one that is actuallyready to do it.andM;At $99, Actor doesn't cost much more than a couple of textbooks.andP;  This is anideal way to learn to program in a true Object Oriented Language.andP;  (Thepromotional pricing was supposedly over in July, but I think the market for a$99 product is MUCH greater than that for a $249 product.)andM;Since Actor is a full-featured language, the learning time will not be wastedfor programmers who decide to move up to the Actor Professional.andP;  Except forsome packaging issues, Actor 3.1 and Actor 3.1 Professional are very similar.andO;The Professional version lets you &quot;seal off&quot; your programs, meaning you cancreate standalone executables.andP;  Actor Professional, which costs $495,includes a copy of the Whitewater Resource Toolkit, as well as Whitewater'sObjectGraphics class library.andM;(Small)talk is cheapandM;Smalltalk is the &quot;granddaddy&quot; of Object Oriented Languages, first developedat Xerox Park.andP;  The main supplier of Smalltalk is Digitalk of Los Angeles,CA.andP;  Their product Smalltalk V (that's &quot;V&quot; for &quot;Virtual,&quot; not the Romannumeral 5) has strong platform support.andP;  It's available for DOS, Windows,Presentation Manager, and Macintosh.andP;  The DOS version sells for only $100 andhas its own graphical user interface.andP;  Although this version does not giveyou the full power found in the Windows version, it is an economical place tostart learning OOP.andM;When deciding between Actor and Smalltalk V, consider the following points.andO;Smalltalk is important for historical reasons, so you may find academicsupport for it, such as textbooks and classroom training.andP;  Also, you mayprefer Smalltalk's stronger cross platform support.andM;On the other hand, you may find Actor appealing because of the key role thatthe Whitewater Group is playing in the Windows development world.andP;  Also,since Actor was developed more recently, it may have modern features thattake advantage of lessons learned in the years since Smalltalk was developed.andO;For example, C and Pascal programmers may find Actor's syntax more familiarthan Smalltalk's.andM;What about C++andM;With so many languages to choose from, it may seem natural to go straight toC++ as your first object oriented programming language.andP;  C++ takes advantageof the programming skills of the army of C programmers.andP;  But that is also adisadvantage.andP;  C++ doesn't deliver OOP benefits unless the programmer learnsto think in object oriented concepts.andP;  Since traditional C syntax issupported, a programmer may be tempted to do it the old way.andM;That's why the best preparation for programming in C++ is to learn an &quot;OOPonly&quot; language such as Actor or Smalltalk.andM;Books that can helpandM;OOP presents so many new concepts that you are going to need to build up yourlibrary.andP;  Because the C++ marketplace is growing so fast, many new OOP booksfocus on that language.andP;  The one that helped me get started upgrading myskills from C to C++ was Teach yourself C++ by Al Stevens from the MIS Press.andO;The advantage of this book is that it goes very slowly, one concept at atime.andP;  For a beginning OOP or C++ programmer this is important, since themain danger of learning this new technology is the avalanche effect.andP;  Afterthe tenth new concept in one paragraph your brain shuts down.andP;  Stevens hasdone an admirable job of presenting one idea at a time.andP;  He goes so slowlyyou never suffer from mental shutdown.andM;After a while you get the idea and want to move to the next level.andP;  I waslucky to  come across a new book by Herbert Shildt from Osborne/McGraw-Hillcalled C++: The Complete Reference.andP;  With a title like that you wouldn'tthink that it would make a good second book.andP;  But this book is a great placeto continue with your C++ learning.andP;  Schildt covers every subject withastonishing clarity, making the most complex subjects understandable.andP;  Heincludes examples with every explanation, not only to make the point clear,but to give practical guidance.andP;  There are even chapters that explain thedevelopment of real life C++ classes.andP;  And since C++ also includes the Clanguage, a C++ reference also must include material on C. This may seem anintrusion when buying a C++ book, but I wasn't disappointed.andP;  The C languagesection is more than just filler.andP;  Schildt explains, clarifies and givesexamples that will come in handy even for experienced C programmers.andM;Both books should be available at your bookstore.andP;  Borland International,(408) 438-8400 Digitalk, (213)645-1082 The Whitewater Group, (708) 328-3800</TEXT></DOC>
