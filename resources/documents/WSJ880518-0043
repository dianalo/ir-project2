Sease and David Wilson </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> STK NDX </IN><TEXT>   Investors who had been longing for a big improvement in the trade deficit relearned an old lesson yesterday: Be careful what you wish for; you might get it.    Despite a surprisingly narrow March trade deficit of $9.75 billion, stock prices plunged as investors translated the favorable report into a sign of accelerating inflation. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 21.22 to 1986.41.    Volume on the New York Stock Exchange dropped to 133.8 million shares from 155 million Monday. Declining issues on the Big Board outstripped gainers 985 to 521.    The response to the much narrower deficit surprised many analysts, who had assumed that an improvement in the nation's trade picture -- which sent the dollar up sharply yesterday -- would reassure investors. Yesterday's session indicated that investor pessimism is pervasive, they said.    &quot;Wall Street is so gloomy they wouldn't know good news if they tripped over it,&quot; said Peter Canelo, a market strategist at Bear Stearns.    Stock prices took their cue from the bond market, where prices shot up on the news that the trade gap had shrunk. But as bond traders and investors sorted through the trade report, they soon found strong hints that the economy is running at a brisker pace than they thought. That renewed their inflation fears, and bond prices retreated, followed closely by stock prices. By the end of the day, both markets were off sharply.    &quot;The culprit has to be the money markets,&quot; said Jon Groveman, a trader at Ladenburg Thalman. &quot;Stocks have big problems with interest rates going up.&quot;    He said the bond market's performance reflected not only worries about the inflationary implications of the trade figure but also the lack of any downward move in commodity prices. &quot;A lot of people thought a good trade number would cause weakness in commodities, but it didn't,&quot; he said.    Despite the markets' response, several analysts said they were encouraged by the trade number.    &quot;Even after you take the trade number apart, it's still a good number,&quot; said Jeffrey Applegate, a market strategist at Tucker, Anthony andamp; R.L. Day. &quot;It's further confirmation that the trade picture is turning.&quot;    Mr. Canelo of Bear Stearns said the financial markets overreacted to the inflation side of the trade report.    &quot;Sure, we see more people getting jobs, but the underlying trend in consumer spending is quite moderate,&quot; he said. With jobs growing more rapidly than consumer spending, he said, &quot;people are saving money, and if they're saving money, economic growth is not going to hurt the bond market.&quot;    Mr. Canelo said he views the trade report as extremely bullish for stocks. &quot;If we've got an export boom, that means profits for American companies,&quot; he said. &quot;Investors are overlooking profits right now because they feel the competitive pull of high bond yields, but once the bond market stabilizes, investors are going to start paying attention to the big profitability implications of an export boom.&quot;    Among blue-chips, F.W. Woolworth was off 1 1/2 to 51 3/4; Procter andamp; Gamble lost 1 1/8 to 73 5/8; International Paper was down 7/8 to 42; Aluminum Co. of America fell 7/8 to 44 1/2; McDonald's closed at 42 3/4, off 7/8; and United Technologies ended at 36 3/4, off 7/8.    Texaco advanced 1/2 to 49 3/8. The Wall Street Journal reported that representatives of the company and investor Carl Icahn, its largest holder, held talks to try to head off Mr. Icahn's threatened proxy fight. The discussions reportedly focused on ways to restructure Texaco to accommodate Mr. Icahn.    American Telephone andamp; Telegraph fell 3/4 to 26 1/2. Seven computer companies said they formed the Open Software Foundation, a consortium that will seek to develop software to rival the version of the Unix system developed by ATandamp;T and Sun Microsystems. Sun eased 3/8 to 33 3/4 in over-the-counter trading. ATandamp;T said it remains committed to its Unix standard.    Separately, the federal government decided to award to ATandamp;T contracts for phone switches that had been granted to three &quot;Baby Bell&quot; companies. BellSouth lost 5/8 to 39; Bell Atlantic dropped 7/8 to 66 1/2; and Pacific Telesis edged 3/8 lower to 28 7/8.    Cray Research plunged 5 1/8 to 76 3/4. Shearson Lehman Hutton cut its 1988 and 1989 earnings estimates and reduced its investment rating on the stock, according to Dow Jones Professional Investor Report. Cray stood by its projection of 10% growth in per-share earnings this year.    &quot;We haven't changed our tune,&quot; a spokesman said. &quot;We're sticking to all our projections.&quot;    Irving Bank gained 3/4 to 61 3/8 while Bank of New York fell 7/8 to 31 1/8. Bank of New York extended its takeover offer until May 24 and waived a condition that Irving redeem its &quot;poison pill&quot; stock purchase rights. The moves followed a preliminary report that Bank of New York lost its proxy fight for control of Irving's board.    General Motors Class H, representing GM's Hughes Electronics unit, climbed 1/2 to 28 1/2. Hughes agreed to acquire the Westar satellite system from Western Union; the price wasn't disclosed. Western Union closed unchanged at 2 7/8.    Banco Central rose 7/8 to 26 1/2 on news that it is contemplating a merger with Spain's Banco Espanol de Credito.    Gerber Products added 3/8 to 40 3/8. Merrill Lynch repeated its buy recommendation on the stock and raised its earnings estimates.    The American Stock Exchange index fell 1.39 to 296.57. A.L. Laboratories was off 5/8 to 13 1/8. The company filed to offer 1.6 million common shares. Proceeds would be used to retire long-term bank debt. </TEXT></DOC>
