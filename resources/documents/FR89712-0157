The gas would be purchased formWestern Gas Marketing Limited, an Alberta corporation (WGML), to fuel FEA'snew combined cycle cogeneration facility to be built in Orange, Connecticut.Commercial operation of the facility is expected to begin in 1991. UnderFEA's proposed gas purchase agreement with WGML, delivery of the gas wouldbegin on the first day of the test phase of the cogeneration facility whichalso would initiate the term of the requested import authorization. The gas will enter the United States at the international border near Waddington,New York, where the pipeline facilities of TransCanada PipeLines Limited(TCPL) and the proposed Iroquois Gas Transmission System (Iroquois) interconnect,and then would be transported through Iroquois to FEA. Iroquois has anapplication pending before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)to construct its new pipeline and provide transportation for the importedvolumes. The application is filed under section 3 of the Natural Gas Act (NGA) andDOE Delegation Order Nos. 0204-111 and 0204-127.

The proposed cogenerationfacility was certified by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)in FERC Docket No. QF87-412-000 as a ``qualifying facility'' under thePublic Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA). On June 8, 1989,FEA filed with the DOE a Certification of Compliance with the coal capabilityrequirement for proposed new electric powerplants pursuant to the Powerplantand Industrial Fuel Use Act of 1978, as amended. The electricity producedby the cogeneration facility would be sold to Consolidated Edison Companyof New York, Inc. (Con Edison). Thermal energy recovered from the facilitywould be used by Miles Pharmaceuticals Division of Miles Laboratories,Inc. In accordance with a precedent agreement dated May 1, 1989, FEA and WGML,the marketing subsidiary of TCPL, will execute a gas purchase agreementwhen all governmental authorizations have been obtained and all conditionsrelating to the completion of the required new facilities have been met.Under the provisions of the draft gas purchase agreement furnished withits application, FEA would pay WGML a two-part border price comprised ofa demand charge and a commodity charge. The base price of the gas wouldbe indexed to the fuel adjustment provision of Con Edison's SC-21 tarifffor buy-back service and Con Edison's Industrial Gas Tariff, both as approvedby the New York Public Service Commission. FEA states that the initialborder price at 100 percent load factor (Initial Base Price) would be $2.75per Mcf based on the Con Edison indices for the month of March 1989. Theprice will be adjusted monthly based on changes in the indices. The totalcost of gas delivered to FEA's cogeneration facility would include chargesincurred for pipeline transmission from the international border.   The monthly demand charge under the proposed contract between FEA and WGMLwould be the product of the average of the daily contract quantities oneach day of the relevant month (excluding quantities delivered to the newcogeneration facility during its test phase) and the monthly demand rate.The monthly demand rate would be the sum of (a) the monthly demand tollper Mcf for the firm transportation of gas on TCPL's system from the Alberta-Saskatchewanborder to the point of delivery on the international border; (b) the averagemonthly demand toll equivalent per Mcf as billed by Nova to WGML for transportationof the gas to the Alberta border during the previous year; and (c) a currentsupply reservation fee of $4.563 per Mcf per month which is the equivalentof the average monthly demand toll per MMBtu as billed by WGML in the precedingcontract year. The commodity charge would be equal to the adjusted base price (ABP) lessthe product of the monthly demand charge rate per Mcf calculated as describedabove and converted to a charge per MMBtu based on an average monthly heatingvalue of the gas transported to the point of delivery, and 12, dividedby 265. The ABP for each delivery month would be adjusted in accordancewith a formula stated as ABP=2.75andmultiply;AFC. AFC (adjusted fuel cost)for any month is calculated by the following formula: <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>6,L1(0,0,0),b1,tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,aw,4,1,6,5,6,4</C> <H1>AFC </H1><H1>=</H1><H1>CEAFC</H1><H2>CEAFC1</H2><H1>andmultiply;0.5+</H1><H1>CEGC</H1><H2>CEGC1</H2><H1>andmultiply;0.5</H1><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="26">Where: </ITAG>CEAFC (Con Edison Average Fuel Cost) is equal to the sum of the valuesincluded under the headings ``Base Cost of Fuel per Kilowatt Hour'' andthe ``Rate Adjustment per Kilowatt Hour For All Bills Rendered Monthly''published during the month preceding the delivery month in the statementof Fuel Adjustment filed for Con Edison with the New York State PublicService Commission under the heading ``Applicable to All Service ClassificationsExcept for 25-Cycle Service''; and CEAFC1 is equal to 2.8328 cents perkilowatt hour: And CEGC (Con Edison Gas Cost) is equal to Con Edison'sRetail Natural Gas Price during the month preceding the delivery monthof Commercial and Industrial Firm Gas service of 100,000 Mcf per monthas set forth in the Monthly Energy Price Report published by the New YorkState Energy Office; and CEGC1 is equal to $5.5400 per Mcf. Either FEA or WGML may require renegotiation of the pricing terms of thecontract during the contract years commencing November 1, 1993, November1, 1998, and November 1, 2003. In the event there is no agreement on suchpricing terms, either party has the right to refer the matter to arbitration.If FEA's gas purchases from WGML fall below 75 percent of the aggregateof the maximum daily quantities in a contract year (13,000andmultiply;365days), FEA must pay a deficiency charge levied on the volumes not takenbelow the minimum quantity, equal to the average of the commodity chargesin effect during the year. In addition, the amount which WGML is obligatedto supply is subject to reduction if FEA takes less tha minimum contractvolumes. In support of its application, FEA states that the import arrangement iscompetitive and would remain so over the term of the authorization. FEAasserts that this import would be secure because WGML has under contractwith producers in the Province of Alberta sufficient quantities of gasto meet all of its supply commitments, including the volumes to be purchasedby FEA. In addition, FEA asserts that any curtailment of WGML commitmentsto this project would occur ``only if all other WGML exports are curtailedand then only on a pro rata basis.'' According to FEA, current estimatesplace Alberta reserves from conventional producing areas at 65.3 Tcf andpotential marketable reserves at 150 Tcf. By contrast, FEA states thatat full deliveries under its proposed purchase contract with WGML the totalquantity would be 0.07 Tcf. The decision on FEA's application for import authority will be made consistentwith the DOE's gas import policy guidelines, under which the competitivenessof an import arrangement in the markets served is the primary considerationin determining whether it is in the public interest (49 FR 6684). Othermatters that may be considered in making a public interest determinationinclude need for gas, security of the long-term supply, and any relevantissues that may be unique to cogeneration facilities. Parties that mayoppose this application should comment in their responses on the issuesof competitiveness, need for the gas, and security of supply as set forthin the policy guidelines. The applicant asserts that this import arrangementis in the public interest because it is competitive and its gas sourcewill be secure. Parties opposing the import arrangement bear the burdenof overcoming these assertions. All parties should be aware that if the requested import is approved, theauthorization would be conditioned on the filing of quarterly reports indicatingvolumes imported and the purchase price.   <ITAG tagnum="84">NEPA Compliance</ITAG>The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321 <T3>et seq</T3>.) requires the DOE to give appropriate consideration tothe environmental effects of its proposed actions. The FERC, in DocketNo. CP89-634-000 encompassing the Iroquois pipeline project, is currentlyperforming an environmental review of the impacts of constructing and operatingthe proposed facilities through which Iroquois would transport the importbefore making its decision on the certificate application. The DOE willparticipate in the environmental review process at the appropriate level.No final decision will be issued in this proceeding until the DOE has metits NEPA responsibilities regarding the FEA application.<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comment Procedures</ITAG>In response to this notice, any person may file a protest, motion to interveneor notice of intervention, as applicable and written comments. Any personwishing to become a party to the proceeding and to have the written commentsconsidered as the basis for any decision on the application must, however,file a motion to intervene or notice of intervention, as applicable. Thefiling of a protest with respect to this application will not serve tomake the protestant a party to the proceeding, although protests and commentsreceived from persons who are not parties will be considered in determiningthe appropriate action to be taken on the application.
