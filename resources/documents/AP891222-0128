After years of debate, court rulings and federal legislation,use of the polygraph has dropped sharply, despite supporters whoinsist the test is a good indicator of whether someone is telling alie.   ``They have been useless and give misleading information,'' saidLeonard Saxe, a visiting professor of psychology at BrandeisUniversity and a leading opponent of polygraph testing. ``Theysuggest whether you're guilty or innocent. You might as well flip acoin.''   Last week, the state Supreme Court banned lie detector testsfrom being introduced as evidence in criminal trials. Massachusettshad been one of the last remaining states that gave defendants theright to use polygraphs to support their alibis.   The court, noting polygraph studies have shown success ratesvarying from 95 percent to just above 50 percent, said: ``Thereremains no consensus among experts as to the accuracy of polygraphtesting to detect deceit.''   The court was not alone in deciding against polygraphs, whichattempt to determine someone's honesty by their physiologicalresponse to certain questions.   Last year, Congress prohibited most private sector employersfrom using lie dectectors to screen job applicants or randomly testworkers.   Exempted from the rules were federal, state and localgovernments, firms that do sensitive work for agencies like the CIAand FBI, companies that provide security services and those thatmake or distribute controlled substances.   ``I think it's appropriate to seek if someone is lying, and themost appropriate way is to seek evidence,'' said Judy Crockett, whofought on behalf of the federal law for the American CivilLiberties Union. ``Polygraphs tend to be an attempt to short-cutinvestigations.''   The federal law, which took effect a year ago, has taken a bigbite out of the polygraph business.   ``There's been a definite decline in the private sector,'' saidChris Fausett, product manager for Lafayette Instrument Co., basedin Lafayette, Ind., one of the country's largest makers ofpolygraph machines.   He declined to give specific numbers, but he said the drop was``about as sharp as you can get.''   ``No doubt businesses have had to abandon 75-80 percent ofpolygraph tests,'' said Joseph Buckley, a spokesman for theAmerican Polygraph Association, a trade group based in Chattanooga,Tenn.   Buckley said his group had about 3,000 members a year ago, butthe number has dropped by a third. ``A lot of them had to changecareers,'' he said.   However, these trends do not mean polygraph testing is dead.   Law enforcement agencies use lie detectors to interviewwitnesses when investigating crimes.   The Department of Defense uses polygraph testing to search forspies, and also to screen job applicants if something suspiciousarises in background checks, said spokesman Jim Turner.   Reading from a Defense Department statement regarding the use ofpolygraphs, Turner said:   ``In all instances the polygraph exam process produced data ofimportant security or criminal significance which was not otherwiseobtainable. It was also invaluable in establishing the innocence ofpeople confronted with serious accusations.''   Many states allow polygraph evidence to be introduced if boththe prosecution and defense agree.   New Mexico is the one state where either party can introduce apolygraph examination as evidence, with the trial judge decidingwhether the tests meet certain standards. But not everyone in thestate supports it.   Timothy Cornish, a prosecutor in the New Mexico attorneygeneral's office, called polygraph exams ``witchcraft.''   ``It can, if used in an unbridled way, change the entiretruth-seeking process,'' he said. ``It replaces the jury.''   David Raskin, a University of Utah psychologist often calledupon to support polygraphs in the courtroom, said he favored thefederal law because lie detectors were being misused to predictfuture performance in the workplace. But he said they are reliabletools in determining someone's past actions.   ``Every piece of evidence has a dose of uncertainty,'' Raskinsaid. ``Jurors are very cautious with polygraph evidence. They areoverly skeptical. They do not ignore other evidence and concentrateon the polygraph.''</TEXT></DOC>
