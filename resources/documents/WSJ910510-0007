Unemployment rose to a seasonally adjusted 9.9% in Aprilfrom 9.2% in March and from 6.3% in April 1990. Unemploymentclimbed from 5.9% over the past 17 months as the economy sankinto a recession.   The government said the unemployment data might indicatejob losses in the recession have bottomed, givenunprecedented rises in both employment and the labor-forceparticipation rate, up 70,000.   But the Business Council said that despite tentative signsthe slump in domestic activity may have leveled, any pickupwill be slow. Worse yet, a survey of the council's membercompanies found a further contraction in investment and jobsis possible.                                                                                                          ANOTHER NAME IS SWEETER                                                                                                          Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank Co., the awkward name created by a1989 merger that formed the world's second-richest bank, willbe rechristened Sakura Bank Co. next April to evoke one ofJapan's best-loved symbols, the cherry blossom, and project awarmer image. Customer-friendly names and symbols have becomecommon among Japan's financial institutions. Two years ago, arural Okayama bank attracted more than 50,000 new depositorsby changing its name to Tomato Bank Co.                                                                                                          EUROPEAN AIRLINES' TRAFFIC FALLS                                                                                                          European airlines' first-quarter traffic fell 14% from ayear earlier because of the Persian Gulf war. The total wasdragged down by a 24% decline in February. But March trafficshowed signs of recovery, the Association of EuropeanAirlines said. April's preliminary data indicate globaltravel hasn't recovered fully.                                                                                                          ANTI-TERROR TEAMS IN LONDON                                                                                                          London police in July will introduce heavily armed patrolvans to tour the capital round the clock and react instantlyto any terrorist attacks. The new &quot;armed response vehicles&quot;will be operated by Scotland Yard's tactical firearms unit.British police on the beat are usually unarmed. The IrishRepublican Army, fighting to oust Britain from NorthernIreland, has attacked public buildings, railway stations andpublic figures in recent months.                                                                                                          PRAGUE TO CLOSE STATE BUILDERS                                                                                                          Seven state-owned construction companies with 600employees will be liquidated as part of Czechoslovakia'stransition from communist central planning to a marketeconomy. Following democratic changes in 1989, Prague on Jan.1 launched a reform program based on price decontrol,privatization and elimination of state subsidies. Inflationsoared 40%, unemployment reached 2.5% and gross nationalproduct sank 5.8%; the building industry's output plunged 33%in the first two months.                                                                                                          EUROPEANS URGE DRUG WEB                                                                                                          In Eastern and Western European nations' first talks ondrugs, officials at the Oslo session urged joint efforts suchas data exchanges and police training to combat a risingillicit trade encouraged by relaxed border controls and thecollapse of hard-line communist regimes. As central controlseased, more drugs flowed in, many on new routes from Asia.Soviet seizures, mostly marijuana and hashish, rose 28% to34.7 metric tons last year. European cocaine seizures morethan doubled to a record 12.9 tons.                                                                                                          SPANIARDS DEFEND THEIR TILDE                                                                                                          Spain's Culture Ministry, the Royal Spanish Academy ofLanguage and Spanish-speaking authors are fighting mad aboutthe European Community Commission's demand that Spain dropits requirement that computer keyboards have a tilde mark.   &quot;It's totally absurd,&quot; the Peruvian writer Mario VargasLlosa told the Madrid daily El Pais. &quot;It's not simply theletter n with a little line over the top. It's a sovereignsound that expresses a clear nuance&quot; in the language.   The EC contends keyboards with the tilde, the diacriticalmark over the letter n in Spanish that indicates a nasalsound, offer an unfair trading advantage to Spanishcompanies. Accent marks aren't required on keyboards sold inFrance, Germany, Portugal and Greece. The EC is insistingSpain abolish its rules that printers, keyboards and computerscreens include the tilde, as part of Madrid's participationin dismantling trading barriers before European integrationnext year.   Ready for a fight, the language academy created a tildedefense group. Without the mark, the academy director said,even Spain's name would have to spelled differently, perhapsEspanya or Espanha.                                                                                                          POSTSCRIPTS . . .                                                                                                          The Soviet Union marked the 46th anniversary of thevictory over Nazi Germany with muted ceremonies that gaveunusual emphasis to the U.S.'s role in winning the war. AMoscow parade featured Soviet and American marching bands. .. . Ethiopia, seeking to hold talks with rebels who haverecently made major advances, named a more moderate,ethnically diverse cabinet, with nine new members, that vowedto achieve a peaceful political solution to the long-runningcivil wars.</TEXT></DOC>
