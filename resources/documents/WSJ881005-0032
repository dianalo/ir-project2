Augusto Pinochet's proposal to extend his rule until 1997. Increasingly, this campaign has seemed to catch the ruling junta off balance and it has responded with an escalating barrage of nastiness and vitriol.    New government posters, for example, show three rainbows and describe them as &quot;the emblems of homosexuals&quot; who could bring AIDS to Chile. Such campaigning has led many to the view that the junta is worried. &quot;The fact the government is so desperate leads us to believe we may be on the verge of proving that you can oust a dictatorship with a vote,&quot; says Jorge Schaulsohn, secretary-general of the center-left Party for Democracy, or PPD. If the 'no' vote wins, Gen. Pinochet, who has ruled for 15 years, must call open presidential elections by the end of next year. The new president would take office in March 1990.    The opposition's claims are denied by Undersecretary for the Interior AlbertoCardemil, who says the regime will win &quot;by a clear margin.&quot; But that seems unlikely. The optimism on both sides and Chile's deep divisions suggest a close result. This in turn may lead to a period of deepening tensions, charged with the possibility of violence.    Western diplomats and several opinion polls concur that the opposition's forward-looking campaign may have given it an edge of perhaps 55% to 45%. The junta, by contrast, has dwelt on the specter of communism and a return to the strife experienced under Marxist President Salvador Allende, who died in the 1973 military coup that brought Gen. Pinochet to power. It has had less to say about the future.    Nonetheless, as more than seven million Chileans vote 'yes' or 'no' to the 72-year-old general, the junta says it is confident. President Pinochet has an almost messianic vision of his and the armed forces' essential role in governing Chile between now and the end of the century, and some still doubt a mere vote could oust him.    Moreover, strong growth and relatively low inflation over the past four years favor the regime. So too do economic chaos in the neighboring democracies of Peru and Argentina, fear of the unknown, and the lack of an obvious leader among the moderate opposition. There is also apprehension about the left, mainly among older people.    &quot;I remember how under Allende I had to wake at three in the morning to buy a kilo of bread for my kids, and I brushed my teeth with bicarbonate of soda,&quot; says electrical worker Francisco Storch. &quot;I'm voting 'yes' so that communism never returns.&quot;    Die-hard anti-communists have been joined in the regime's constituency by many moderates who would prefer civilian rule but will still vote for Gen. Pinochet because they see this as the only safeguard for the country's economic stability.    U.S. policy has reflected the same two desires. Washington has pushed gently for democracy while applauding the regime's market-oriented economic reforms. &quot;We have been torn between the State Department's concerns on human rights and Treasury's delight at an economic success story,&quot; says Rep. Bruce Morrison (D., Conn.), who visited Chile last week. The U.S. is calling for a clean vote and respect of its results.    Most indications are that the vote will be free of fraud. But, in an atmosphere of great tension, rumors are rife of military provocation, a blackout or a curfew if the vote is seen to be going the opposition's way.    The U.S. State Department publicly expressed concern that the regime might interfere with or even cancel the plebiscite. Yesterday, the Foreign Ministry summoned U.S. Ambassador Harry Barnes to complain about what it views as U.S. meddling.    If the 'yes' vote wins, the extreme left -- and perhaps others -- will immediately charge fraud and call for strikes, demonstrations and popular upheaval to oust the president. There will also be an enormous sense of frustration among the more moderate opposition. All this is likely to be met by a tough military clampdown, at least in the immediate aftermath of the poll.    If the 'no' vote wins, the unity of the opposition is likely to dissolve fairly quickly. The left will probably press for Gen. Pinochet's immediate departure and changes in the 1980 constitution, which guarantees effective military tutelage even for an eventual civilian president. The centrist opposition, however, will want to tread carefully and is prepared to wait for the presidential election at the end of next year called for in the constitution. &quot;We must not be hysterical,&quot; says Mr. Schaulsohn.    The military, meanwhile, has said it will stick to the letter of the constitution. Thus it is likely to severely repress any demonstrations calling for immediate elections, and point to them as evidence of the Marxism and chaos it says threaten the country if the armed forces give up power. The enthusiastic fervor stemming from a 'no' victory, in a country still governed by the military, could thus lead to an explosive situation, many analysts believe. </TEXT></DOC>
