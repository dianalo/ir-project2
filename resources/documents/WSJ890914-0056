Foreign-exchange traders said selling based on technical factors accelerated the U.S. currency's slide but noted that the quick move underscored the market's jitters over a series of U.S. economic data due for release today and tomorrow.    The dollar has posted strong gains recently on perceptions that a steady slowing of U.S. economic activity has halted and that a modest rebound is under way. Traders cautioned that if the economic indicators betray the latest view, the dollar may tumble.    Concerns also continue to weigh on the U.S. currency that European central banks -- in particular the Bundesbank -- will raise interest rates soon, drawing away money from dollar-denominated interest-bearing investments, traders said.    In late afternoon New York trading, the dollar was at 1.9705 marks, down from 1.9863 marks late Tuesday, and at 146.33 yen, down from 146.95 yen. Sterling was at $1.5600, up from $1.5488.    In Tokyo Thursday, the U.S. currency opened for trading at 146.05 yen, down from Wednesday's Tokyo close of 146.70 yen.    Dealings got under way uneventfully in Asia yesterday, with prices confined to Tuesday's narrow range. The dollar slipped below technical support at 147 yen in the Tokyo afternoon, however, and the Bank of Japan sold dollars as the currency was weakening in order to amplify the effect of its intervention.    The intervention, although reportedly small, helped trigger further selling, which pushed the dollar beneath its trading range by the start of European dealings.    Then, a rumor that the Bundesbank was planning to switch its key Lombard rate to a daily floating rate from a fixed level unnerved the market further, traders said. Although reaction to the rumor was limited and it was subsequently found to be untrue, &quot;it's the sort of thing that reinforces to a lot of people that caution is the way to play it,&quot; said Valerie Walker, corporate foreign-exchange manager at Harris Trust andamp; Savings Bank in New York.    Traders pointed to jumps in some German interest rates as a likely background for the rumor.    Profit-taking kept the dollar under pressure at the start of U.S. trading. And, in the afternoon, the market was further unsettled by reports that early September U.S. car sales had fizzled and a statement from a meeting of the Group of 10 industrial nations, stressing the need for more intense cooperation in monetary policy coordination.    At one point, the dollar fell below a closely watched chart point at 1.9750 marks, sparking fears that the U.S. currency would tumble rapidly, unleashing a wave of technical sales that bore the dollar to its lows of 1.9700 marks and 146.15 yen.    In hindsight, dealers said the lower car sales figures, largely because of small Ford Motor Co. inventories, and the G-10 official's routine statement would have gone unnoticed in a less nervous market.    Traders with more optimistic views on the dollar stressed that the currency's fall has cleaned up a market perceived as top-heavy with long-dollar positions and has paved the way for new buying once the indicators are released.    Others, however, see the move as indicative of a shift away from confidence that the U.S. indicators due at the end of the week will bolster the dollar.    &quot;While 2.05 {marks} is still possible, I think with the momentum having stopped here this week it's going to take some really good, good {economic} news to push us up. And I'm expecting just OK news,&quot; said John Lynam, vice president at Security Pacific International Bank in New York. &quot;If we don't get through 2.00 {marks}&quot; tomorrow, &quot;we then could see a serious correction,&quot; Mr. Lynam said.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $359.90 an ounce, up 40 cents. Estimated volume was a light 1.3 million ounces.    In early trading in Hong Kong Thursday, gold was quoted at $359.55 an ounce. </TEXT></DOC>
