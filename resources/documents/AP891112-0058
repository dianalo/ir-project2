East Germany's Communist Party leader called for an emergencyparty congress and indicated a new slate of leaders will beinstalled to replace the Old Guard and institute reforms in hischanging nation.   Another hole was cut through the Berlin Wall to the roaringcheers of spectators. East Berliners continued to flood the westernhalf of the city, buying all they could afford with their $55 ofgovernment ``welcome money.''   By Sunday afternoon, Burger King was out of beer and Haagen-Dazhad sold all its ice cream bars.   Unlike thousands who abandoned their Communist homeland for theWest in recent weeks, most people crossing on the weekend were justvisiting, taking advantage of the freedom created by the openingThursday of East Germany's borders. By Sunday night, the bordergridlock had eased, and West Berlin's streets were returning tonormal.   Reflecting the new open-border policy, East German DefenseMinister Heinz Kessler said Sunday that border guards, who onceshot at their fleeing countrymen, have been told not to usefirearms any more in cases of border violations.   But amid the euphoria, there were reminders of the politicalchanges and uncertainty still sweeping through East Germany, whichbegan carving passages through the 29-mile-long Berlin Wall onFriday.   Communist Party chief Egon Krenz called for an emergency partycongress next month, the official ADN news agency said. Heindicated a new Central Committee will be elected to carry outvarious reforms aimed at stopping East Germans from going West.   ``We need a Central Committee that can carry the fullresponsibility and enjoys full trust,'' Krenz was quoted as tellingreporters.   Krenz said the current Central Committee would meet Monday toapprove holding the congress. Also Monday, East Germany'sParliament is to meet to name a Cabinet to replace the one thatresigned Tuesday. The reform-minded party chief of Dresden, HansModrow, was expected to be named premier.   Since Krenz replaced hard-liner Erich Honecker as party chiefOct. 18, 10 full members of the ruling 21-member Politburo havelost their positions. There also has been pressure for the163-member policy-setting Central Committee, chosen under Honecker,to resign.   On West Berlin's fashionable Kurfuerstendamm avenue, about 1,000leftists marched through the streets shouting slogans againstGerman reunification.   An appeal signed by the official Free German Youth movement andrepresentatives of the democratic opposition voiced fears about``the very existence of our country'' in the wake of the massivewestward stream of visitors.   More than 3 million East Germans headed West over the weekend,while several hundred thousand people made their way to Berlin fromother countries to join a 4-day-old celebration.   ``The wall will never be what it used to be. It remains amemorial to inhumanity,'' West German President Richard vonWeizsaecker said in a speech in West Berlin'sKaiser-Wilhelm-Gedaechtnis Church. The church, a landmark to WorldWar II destruction, combines the bombed-out ruins of the oldKaiser-Wilhelm church with a modern structure.   ``Winter is at the door, the ailing have to be taken care of,''von Weizsaecker said, alluding to the near decimation of parts ofthe East German economy and the severe shortage of medicalpersonnel as a result of the recent exodus of East Germans to theWest.   More than 200,000 East Germans have left East Germany sinceSeptember. There have been reports that medical students have beendrafted to work in hospitals to make up for the loss of doctors andnurses.   Turning his attention to other nations, von Weizsaecker, theformer West Berlin mayor, said: ``The West should be ready to helpEast Germany with open hearts and open doors.''   He cautioned that the West should not interfere in East Germanyinternally but urged the East Berlin leadership to stick to itspromise of free elections.   Weizsaecker later went through the new Berlin Wall crossing atPotsdamer Platz, took several steps into East Berlin and exchangeda few words with some border guards as he was mobbed by hundreds ofpeople.   West Berlin Mayor Walter Momper and his East Berlin counterpart,Erhard Krack, met at the Potsdamer Platz, once a vibrant citycenter but now a bleak no man's land bisected by the Berlin Walland flanked by concrete watchtowers.   Their highly symbolic handshake represented a start of a new eraof optimism on closeness for the German people, although Krenz andother officials have flatly ruled out reunification of thecountries.   Earlier, thousands of people cheered as East German borderguards used jackhammers to bore a hole in the wall at PotsdamerPlatz. It was the fourth opening created in the wall since Friday.The others are at Bernauer Strasse, Puschkinallee, Mahlow and theGlienecker Bridge foot-crossing.   ``It's a great day in our history and the history of theworld,'' said Torsten Fischer, a 20-year-old East German borderguard who has been doing wall duty for six months at PotsdamerPlatz.   Cheering spectators on both sides of the concrete barrierwatched the reunion of mayors.   Outside Berlin, East Germany opened at least 10 more bordercrossings.   British rock star Joe Cocker joined the party in Berlin with aperformance that drew thousands to the Deutschlandhalle concerthall in the western sector, about two miles from the wall. He wasamong more than 20 musicians peforming at the concert, which policesaid was staged parly to drew crowds from the wall.</TEXT></DOC>
