It had piled up estimated debts and losses ofabout $416 million by 1979. The auto sector accounts for 50 percentof Fiat's revenue now. Industrial vehicles, tractors andearth-moving machines bring the total to about 72 percent.   The group boosted its net earnings to $522 million in 1984, to$1.1 billion in 1985 and $1.8 billion in 1986.   Fiat, which last year took over state-controlled Alfa Romeo toincrease its dominance in the Italian market, has a 61 percentshare of the domestic market of automobiles _ a higher percentagethan any other major European car manufacturer _ and a 14.3 percentshare in Europe.   It holds a minor share of the U.S. market, as the bulk of itsproduction is made up of small-sized cars. However it has highhopes for the Alfa Romeo models. The luxury 164 Alfa, Italy's mostexpensive mass-produced sedan, will be marketed aggressively in theUnited States while another Fiat subsidiary, the prestigiousFerrari, has a healthy market for its sports cars overseas.   In the face of growing automation and a modest increase of autodemand in Europe, Besuzzo said Fiat's auto employment is notexpected to rise or decline through the '90s.   Franco Lotito, secretary of the metalworkers division UnioneItaliana Lavoratori (UIL), one of the largest Italian trade unions,agreed with Besuzzo's predictions.   Lotito emphasized that the sharp cut in employment resultingfrom robots at Fiat did not cause a dramatic social impact, thanksto layoffs subsidized by a state fund, early retirements andre-employment of some workers in state jobs.   ``At the beginning we had nourished the illusion that automationcould co-exist with a high rate of employment,'' he added in aninterview. ``That proved wrong, yet we did not oppose technology inthe factories because we were aware it was the only possibility tokeep the auto industry competitive. Unions which opposedautomation, like in Britain, only caused the collapse of thecompanies and massive dismissals.''   The growing health of the group, and of the Agnelli dynasty, hasrecently been worrying some Italian politicians.   The Socialist Party, whose relations with Fiat became tensefollowing a bitter controversy over the candidate to head Telit _ ajoint telecommunications venture between Fiat and the state holdingcopmpany IRI _ accused the Turin group and the Agnellis ofdominating Italian industry.   Some politicians called for an anti-trust law on grounds thatindustrial and financing holdings directly or indirectly controlledby the Agnelli family have a market capitalization equal to 22.8percent of the entire Italian stock market.   Fiat's influence on the Italian news media also came underquestioning. Fiat owns the Turin daily newspaper La Stampa, haseffective control of the Rizzoli publishing house and Milan'sinfluential Corriere della Sera newspaper and has expressed someinterest of moving into commercial television.   Giovanni Agnelli recently cooled down the controversy, notingthat Fiat revenue accounts for less than 4 percent of the grossdomestic product.   ``The three major state-controlled holding companies togetheraccount for 10 percent and this is not causing any worry,'' Agnellisaid.   Agnelli is such a well-known public figure that he is oftenreferred to merely as ``L'avvocato,'' the title for a laywer inItaly (he holds a law degree). He is always widely quoted, whetherit be on business or politics or Italy's most successful soccerteam, Juventus, which he owns.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Wed PMs Feb. 17</NOTE></DOC>
