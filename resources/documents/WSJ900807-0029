Responses range from higher ticket prices imposed by PanAm and Northwest and considered by other airlines, fuelsurcharges tacked on by freight haulers and the likelihood ofhigher utility bills as the cold months approach. Thefollowing is a sampling of how companies are being affected,how they are coping and what they think the future holds:                                                                                                       </LP><TEXT>   AIRLINES                                                                                                          Pan Am Corp. said it plans to raise domestic andinternational fares by 10% starting this week as a result ofsurging jet fuel costs prompted by the invasion. The NewYork-based airline holding company said that it plans toincrease domestic fares Aug. 9 and international fares Aug.15. A spokesman said that the average price the airline paysfor fuel has increased 13% to 69 cents a gallon from 61 centsa gallon in recent days.   Pan Am's move follows a similar proposal by NWA Inc.'sNorthwest Airlines unit. Last Friday, Northwest proposedraising domestic fares $8 each way to offset rising jet-fuelprices.   American Airlines, a unit of AMR Corp., said companyofficials were meeting most of the day yesterday to discuss,among other things, alternatives in light of rising fuelcosts. A spokesman said an increase in the costs of jet fuelof one cent a gallon increases the company's costs by about$2 million a month.   Glenda Hatchett Johnson, a spokeswoman for Delta AirLines, said the company has decided a fuel surcharge would bepremature. But she admits surcharges are under consideration.&quot;For every one cent {a gallon rise} in fuel costs, thattranslates into an additional $20 million annually forDelta,&quot; she said.                                                                                                          UTILITIES                                                                                                          A spokeswoman for Consolidated Edison Co., New York City'selectric and gas utility, said the price of low-sulfurresidual oil that Con Ed burns in its nine main powerstations already has increased in price to $23 a barrel, upfrom $18 a barrel at the beginning of last week. Consumerprice increases are certain to follow, although the utilitywill ratchet up consumers' energy bills slowly. Con Ed hasreserves of about three million barrels purchased at lowerprices, and is temporarily insulated from effects of thesoaring oil prices because it burns a lot of natural gasduring the summer months, when gas is relatively plentifuland cheap. The utility is also planning to use more nuclearenergy in coming months.   At Pacific Gas andamp; Electric Co., the nation's largestinvestor-owned utility, events are being monitored, but nospecial actions are being taken, said Jackalyne Pfannenstiel,vice president of corporate planning.   General Public Utilities, Parsippany, N.J., which reliesmostly on coal and nuclear sources for its energy production,said it is in a &quot;reasonable position&quot; to weather the crisis.But GPU chairman Standley Hoch said that, in the long term,an oil-related recession may spur the company to trim capitalexpenditures. Mr. Hoch said barely 6% of GPU's energy mixcomes from gas and oil.   Philadelphia Electric Co. said it hardly will be affectedby the Iraq-Kuwait conflict because the utility depends onoil to generate less than 5% of its electricity. Instead, thecompany depends on nuclear power plants for aboutthree-fourths of its energy needs. A spokesman noted that theutility was hit very hard by the Arab oil embargo in theearly 70s. &quot;Let's just say it's a lesson you should only haveto learn once,&quot; he said.   John Rowe, chief executive officer of New England ElectricSystem, Westborough, Mass., says the utility will react tothe Iraq-Kuwait situation by emphasizing conservationprograms that it helps customers set up. He says the companyalready spends $65 million a year on such efforts, and hasscaled way back on its use of oil -- from more than 50% adecade ago to less than half of that now. Mr. Rowe adds thatthe oil problem &quot;puts additional pressure on the already weakNew England economy.&quot;                                                                                                          OIL AND RELATED FIRMS   Sun Co., a major gasoline refiner and retailer, said itdiscontinued sales of gasoline and distillates tonon-contract customers in the Midwest served by its Toledo,Ohio, and Tulsa, Okla., refineries. The action was taken lastThursday to avoid any disruption of supplies to contractcustomers in the event of panic buying on the spot market,said spokesman Dennis Byrne. The company isn't imposingvolume restrictions on its three other refineries inPennsylvania and Puerto Rico. The Radnor, Pa., company saidit doesn't anticipate shortages because only 4% of its crudeoil comes from Iraq.   USX Corp. is busy trying to find crude oil for itsMarathon Oil unit. &quot;Everyone is scrambling to get as manybarrels as they can so they don't run out,&quot; a spokesman forthe company said. Although the steel and energy giant ismonitoring the situation closely, no other extraordinarymeasures have been taken regarding capital spending orbudgeting programs.   Unocal Corp., the Los Angeles-based petroleum concern,&quot;isn't experiencing, nor do we expect to experience anyimmediate problem from a supply point,&quot; said a spokesman.   Similarly, Los Angeles-based Atlantic Richfield Co., thelargest oil and gas marketer in the West, isn't planning anyextraordinary steps. Arco is largely dependent on Alaskancrude oil.   British Petroleum Co., Britain's biggest corporation andthe world's third-biggest oil company, currently doesn'tobtain any crude oil from Iraq or Kuwait. Three-quarters ofBP's crude oil comes from Alaska's Prudhoe Bay and the NorthSea, the rest mostly from Abu Dhabi. &quot;The embargo isn'treally going to have much effect on us,&quot; a spokesman said.   Quaker State Corp. said it has no contingency plans, sincemost of the crude oil it uses comes from the Appalachianbase. It does, however, expect the price it pays for thedomestic crude to increase with the foreign oil prices,leading to an increase in the prices it charges on its fueloil and other products.   David A. Harpole, spokesman for Lyondell PetrochemicalCo., said his company's Houston refinery processes about60,000 barrels of oil daily from Iraq or Kuwait. Thatrepresents almost 21% of the refinery's volume. Thursday,Lyondell briefly reduced its capacity by 40,000 or 50,000barrels when President Bush issued an executive order tofreeze shipments. The 525,000 barrels which arrived on anIraqi ship were released later Thursday. &quot;We had our supplyand trade people quite busy rounding up additional suppliesof crude on the spot market to replace what was restricted bythe president's executive order,&quot; Mr. Harpole said.   J.K. Riemersma, a vice president of Denver-based HamiltonOil Co., said, &quot;It's a hell of a note when you're prosperingbecause of war.&quot; But Mr. Riemersma says the new-foundprosperity isn't prompting any budget expansions: &quot;In thisbusiness, the price can go down as fast as it came up.&quot;                                                                                                          CHEMICALS                                                                                                          An official at a major chemicals company, who spoke oncondition the company was not identified, said it waschecking ordering patterns to see whether customers had yetstarted to build up their inventories. Noting that somechemical plants are already operating near capacity, he saidsome companies may have to come up with allocation plans toensure &quot;equitable distribution of product&quot; if a buying frenzydeveloped.   Other companies that rely on oil-based feedstocks weremore sanguine. A spokesman for Cabot Corp., an energy andspecialty chemicals concern in Waltham, Mass., said thecompany is closely following the Mideast situation but notyet forming plans based on it.   &quot;There is no particular panic,&quot; said John Edgar, aspokesman for Imperial Chemical Industries PLC, Britain'sbiggest manufacturer and the world's fourth-biggest chemicalcompany. ICI is watching the price of oil and the potentialimpact of the crisis on world economic growth. But thecompany hasn't pushed forward its annual fall budget review,Mr. Edgar said.                                                                                                          TRANSPORTATION                                                                                                          Miami-based Ryder System Inc., the giant transportationand business-services concern, topped off its fuel-storagetanks nationwide after the invasion. David R. Parker,president of the vehicle leasing and services division ofRyder, which buys some 45 million gallons of diesel fuel amonth, also said the company has contacted all its majorsuppliers over the past few days to make sure its supplyagreements are in place. Mr. Parker said the company has hadcontingency plans in place for several years in the event ofan oil crisis.   Federal Express Corp. says that it has rerouted itsEurope-to-Dubai flight so that it doesn't cross Iraqiairspace. In addition, all of its packages that were boundfor Kuwait and Iraq via third-party carriers are being heldat its Mideast center in Dubai. Beyond that, however, theexpress-package concern hasn't done much out of the ordinaryas a result of the Mideast situation, a spokesman says.   Cannon Express Inc., a Springdale, Ark., trucking concern,said it won't cut back on services, but would definitely beapplying additional surcharges on freight rates. The amountof those surcharges hasn't yet been determined, but willdepend on how high oil prices go. About 25% of the 250-truckcompany's operating costs are fuel costs.   Leaseway Transportation Corp. executives decided thatdiesel fuel for the company's trucks would rise by at least10 cents a gallon, and have done some forward buying in thespot market as a hedge. The executives also concluded thatthe rise in energy costs may result in a recession, possiblyworld-wide. Leaseway will be watching closely for any signsthat its major customers, including General Motors Corp.,will be cutting back their hauling. If there are signs of acutback, Leaseway will pare its truck purchases and othercapital spending.                                                                                                          ENGINEERING                                                                                                          Parsons Corp., a Pasadena, Calif., engineering andconstruction firm, has about 100 employees and theirdependents -- including about 30 Americans -- in Kuwaitworking on three major projects for the government. It alsohas more than 200 employees in Saudi Arabia. Parsons has beenunable to reach any of its employees there sincecommunications went down just after the invasion Thursday.With the help of the State Department, Parsons has tried toreach its employees there every hour for the past five days.   Fluor Corp., a construction and engineering firm basedIrvine, Calif., has constructed several major projects inSaudi Arabia and has a &quot;significant number&quot; of employeesthere. Fluor and Parsons said they have parts of a project tooverhaul and expand Saudi Arabia's oil and gas productionfacilities. Neither company would discuss the estimated valueof the Saudi contracts, but analysts have estimated that eachwould get between $2 billion to $5 billion.   One British engineering concern, NEI Parsons is continuingwork on a #70 million contract to supply Iraq with fourturbine generators destined for an oil-fired power stationnorth of Baghdad. The contract, due for completion in 1992,is being funded by a U.K.-government guaranteed line ofcredit to Iraq. &quot;We have not heard anything from the Britishgovernment to make us alter our position on that. I'd rathernot speculate on what might happen,&quot; a spokesman for NorthernEngineering Industries PLC, NEI Parsons's parent, saidyesterday.                                                                                                          OTHERS                                                                                                          Gillette Co. sold $5 million of razors, blades and relatedproducts to the Iraqi government through a bidding process in1989, the last shipment of which was delivered early thisyear. Relations between the company and the country haverecently been severed, said company spokesman David Fausch.He added, though, that the trade goes both ways: Gilletteuses oil in the petroleum-based plastics in such things asblade cartridges and disposable razors.   American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. security chief BruceBarr said that as of 11 a.m. EDT yesterday ATandamp;T's more thanthree dozen employees were safe in several hotels in KuwaitCity and awaiting directions from the company on evacuation.But he said ATandamp;T hasn't communicated directly with itsworkers since Friday, relying instead on State Departmentgo-betweens. Mr. Barr runs ATandamp;T's &quot;crisis-management center&quot;in New Jersey, set up two years ago to devise and distributedetailed survival and evacuation plans covering each countryin which it operates. In Kuwait, the center is trying toarrange vehicles to get employees out, but withcommunications cut, Mr. Barr admits, &quot;It's damn tough.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
