After a five-day conference of 88 leaders, the main guerrillagroup fighting the South African government also said it saw an endin sight to apartheid.   ``The apartheid regime is not only steeped in an irreversiblecrisis, it is weakening in many ways,'' Secretary-General Alfred Nzotold a news conference. ``The end, I think, is in sight.''   Nzo also said the group had discussed the issue of Mrs. Mandela,``and Winnie should be given the opportunity to continue to be thesymbol of our struggle.''   Mrs. Mandela, wife of jailed black leader Nelson Mandela, wassharply condemned last month when her personal bodyguards wereimplicated in the alleged abduction of four black youths and thedeath of one of them.   The ANC dismissed as ``a bluff'' hints of Nelson Mandela's earlyrelease from jail. It said an increasing number of politicalopponents had been imprisoned since a state of emergency was imposedin 1986.   The closed-door conference _ the largest since 1986 _ was calledto review the situation in southern Africa and to discussanti-apartheid strategies, which Nzo said will remain unchanged.   ``The recent election of F.W. de Klerk as leader of the rulingNational Party will not result in any significant change in policy.His recent utterances ... about a dialogue have no substance,'' saidNzo, who is based in Lusaka, Zambia.   ``The situation in South Africa remains unchanged in its mainelements,'' he said. ``Accordingly we must escalate both the masspolitical offensive and our armed actions.''   Thomas Nkobi, the ANC treasurer general, said military forceswill soon begin moving out of Angola under the terms of the southernAfrica peace accord, but he would not say when or where they wouldgo. ``When they move, the people of the world will know,'' he said.   Nzo said the ANC does not seek to operate from Namibia after theSouth African-controlled country becomes independent.   The South-West Africa People's Organization, which has fought aguerrilla war in Namibia against South Africa since 1966, is widelyexpected to win elections scheduled for next November.   ``I have heard different reports. In the past SWAPO said it willdo nothing to stop the struggle against apartheid,'' Nzo said. ``TheANC has not asked to have bases in Namibia.''   He said the ANC will open new missions in Washington, Madrid,Tripoli, Caracas and elsewhere to press for continued internationalsanctions against Pretoria's white minority government.   The conference was sponsored by Norway's largest labor union, LO,with help from the Foreign Ministry.</TEXT></DOC>
