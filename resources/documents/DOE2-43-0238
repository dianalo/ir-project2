Evaluation is done by a program systemallowing the location, identification, and tracing of progressive developmentof peaks as well as the quantification of the mass proportion of individualmineral phases. The dust samples to be processed by the transmissionconcept adopted for the instrument can be quite thin and manufacturedby vibration-compacted - and thus self-supported - tablets pressed intothe boring of a thin metal foil. The miniumum coal dust requirement isapprox. 2 mg. A processing method for laboratory purposes was developedto evaluate the mineral constitution of respirable dust proportions ofbulk material.</TEXT></DOC>
