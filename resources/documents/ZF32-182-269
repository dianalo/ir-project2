(Product enhancement).andO;Ticker:    NOVL.andO;Product:   NetWare 386 3.11 (Network operating system) (Product enhancement).andO;Topic:     EnhancementsUpgradingLocal Area NetworksData IntegrityNetwork Operating Systems.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Jane MorrisseyandM;Novell Inc. is readying an upgrade to its recently released NetWare 3.11operating system that will include a handful of features designed to improveits performance.andM;Officials at Novell's recent Developers Conference in Salt Lake City said theminor upgrade will contain additions that the company originally had plannedto include in previous releases of NetWare 386, Novell's flagship LANoperating system.andP;  Officials declined to disclose a release date for theupgrade, but said it will be available soon.andM;The upgrade incorporates &quot;packet burst&quot; extensions -- originally slated forthe current release, 3.11 -- that permit multiple data packets to betransmitted between the workstation and the server before an acknowledgementis delivered.andP;  Novell is also working to support larger packet sizes overNetWare IPX bridges, another measure to lessen WAN overhead and thusstreamline transmissions.andM;&quot;As you get into wide area networks, IPX becomes very difficult to use,because an acknowledgement is required for every packet -- you get aPing-Pong effect between stations over the network,&quot; said Don Crawford, ownerof DGC Consulting in Phoenix.andP;  &quot;Even with T-1, it can be difficult at times.&quot;andM;The new acknowledgement feature is based on a time-out and resend scheme,sources close to the company said.andP;  For example, if a workstation doesn'treceive the end of a file, it will pause and request that the missing portionbe resent, they added.andM;The release will also include a direct file system application programminginterface (API) that bypasses NetWare's cache memory and affords directcontrol of file allocation, they said.andP;  The chief beneficiaries of thisfeature, which will require new NetWare Loadable Module (NLM) serverapplications, will be database and other developers that use their own cache,and thus want to skirt NetWare's cache to improve performance, officialssaid.andM;One developer said that while he expects the performance benefits of thedirect interface to be minimal, it will provide an extra measure of security.andM;&quot;It's more important for data integrity than the speed issue,&quot; said thedeveloper, who requested anonymity.andP;  &quot;Double-caching can end up [creating]inconsistent cache.&quot;andM;Following the minor NetWare 386 upgrade, the company plans a major newrelease that will provide access to alternative file systems, permittingNetWare clients to request information from systems such as CD ROM ormainframe volumes, officials said.andM;&quot;With [an alternative] file system interface, you can write an NLM that canget underneath NetWare and point to other data, whether it be on a Sunworkstation, a mainframe or a VAX,&quot; said Greg Gianforte, president ofBrightwork Development Inc., a Tinton Falls, N.J., NetWare utility vendor.andO;&quot;Third parties could use standard APIs and not have to go through the backdoor.&quot;andM;Other future enhancements include lifting the current eight-serversimultaneous log-on restriction under Netware, a prerequisite for Novell'sfuture directory services products.andM;Officials at the Provo, Utah, company, which holds the lion's share of theLAN operating system market, said that new tuning programs are also underdevelopment to enable NLM developers to measure the speed and route of theircode.andP;  Novell plans to incorporate a real-time NLM performance monitor in thenext release, as well as more comprehensive auditing features to track areassuch as file reads and writes.andM;To facilitate access to third-party NetWare management tools, Novell Inc. hasbegun selling a select group of third-party offerings through its AfterMarket Products group.andM;The pilot marketing project will consist of specially packaged versions ofsmall vendors' products to help boost their distribution.andP;  Novell initiallyis distributing Fresh Technology Group's line of NetWare utilities.andM;&quot;It's a limited program,&quot; said Jim Bills, executive vice president of salesfor the Provo, Utah, LAN leader.andP;  &quot;The program is [designed] to make sure thetools we feel are necessary to make our product easy to use can be put in thecatalog for a period of time.&quot;andM;Bills said Novell is devoting limited resources to the project -- theproducts can be ordered via an 800 number -- and once a product catches on,the firm will stop selling it to make room for other fledgling programs.andO;Novell will not offer any special discounts in an attempt to avoid conflictwith existing dealer channels.andM;&quot;As soon as there becomes a conflict, we'll drop the product,&quot; Bills said.andO;&quot;That means we've done our job.&quot;andM;Fresh Technology's line of utilities, including NetVision, Remote Console andPrinter Assist, is being distributed by Novell under the name FreshWare infour bundled offerings, said Fresh Technology officials in Gilbert, Ariz.andO;--J.M.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
