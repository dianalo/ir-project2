Seven other Marines and a sailor aboard the helicopter wererescued after the CH-46 Sea Knight, based at Kaneohe Bay in Hawaii,crashed Tuesday night shortly after taking off from the USS Denver.   Four of the survivors were ``stable and in good condition'' atCamp Lester Hospital in Okinawa, said Maj. Kerry Gershaneck, publicaffairs officer of the Marine Corps Air Station at Kaneohe Bay. Theother four were treated and released.   By Thursday, the search for the missing men off Kiyan Cape hadyielded only four pieces of metal, all believed to be from thehelicopter.   Japan reduced its search for the missing at noon Thursday fromseven boats and two aircraft to one vessel due to the decreasedpossibility of survivors, said Kazuhiro Sameshima, spokesman forthe Okinawa office of the Maritime Safety Agency, Japan's coastguard.   The helicopter disappeared at about 11:55 p.m. Tuesday.   Lt. Col. Fred Peck, Marine Corps spokesman in Washington, saidit ``pitched over to the right and went into the water inverted,upside down. I have nothing to indicate why it did that.''   Capt. Lenny Ryan, a spokesman at the Kaneohe Marine Corps AirStation, said the pilot was not wearing night-vision goggles, whichsignificantly enhance vision by amplifying light.   There is no requirement that night-vision goggles be worn duringnight operations, and Gershaneck refused comment on whether thelack of goggles might have contributed to the crash.   He said an investigation into the cause of the crash wascontinuing, but he was not sure if the survivors had beenquestioned.   Master Sgt. Jake Rodrigues, spokesman for U.S. Forces in Japan,said the 22-year-old helicopter carried a crew of four and 18passengers assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment,Okinawa.
