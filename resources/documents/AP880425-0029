The Washington for Jesus rally, which will be held on the grassyMall, will lead into a seven-day, around-the-clock prayer vigilcalled National Praise and Prayer Week that will end at 6 p.m. onMay 5.   ``We're gathering to ask God to heal our country and heal ourchurch,'' said the Rev. John Gimenez, pastor of Rock Church inVirginia Beach, Va., and chairman of the rally's national steeringcommittee.   The rally's aim, Gimenez said, is to show repentance ``becausethe church has gotten away from the statutes of holiness,'' toreconcile differences among Christians and to restore the church toleadership.   ``We as Christian leaders have a responsibility to ourcountry,'' Gimenez said. ``But we've been ineffective latelybecause we've had trouble within our own ranks. We need to getback.''   Gimenez said he decided to organize the rally before thesex-and-money scandals brought down three of the best-knowntelevision evangelists _ Jim and Tammy Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart.But, he said, he believes the rally will help the Christian causeas well as help the country.   ``I heard the voice of the Lord speak to me and say we shouldhave a gathering,'' he said.   Gimenez says he got a similar message from God nearly a decadeago, leading to the first prayer meeting on the Mall in 1980, whichattracted an estimated 200,000 people.   ``We went to Washington to pray at that time because our countrywas in trouble,'' Gimenez recalled. ``We felt we should gather toask forgiveness and to bring healing because our economy was in badshape, our citizens were being held prisoner in Iran.   ``And lo and behold, our economy improved and our citizens werereleased.''   This time, he said, ``we're finding many of the same problems _the Iranians, our economy is getting shakier, we have a drugepidemic.''   Although the rally is dedicated to reviving old-fashionedChristian values, it will rely on the latest in technology to getthe message across.   Nine huge screens, similar to those in baseball parks, will lineboth sides of the Mall and stand behind the stage. The screens willdisplay the activities on stage and videotapes of people theaudience will be praying for. The stage, according to a Washingtonfor Jesus press release, is capable of seating a 1,500-voice choir,a 100-piece orchestra a hundreds of dignitaries and Christianleaders.   Gimenez estimated the cost of organizing the rally at $1.3million.   Among the scheduled speakers are singer Pat Boone, TV ministerKenneth Copeland and Christian radio show host James Dobson.   Gimenez said the rally will not have any political overtones.Pat Robertson was a speaker at the 1980 rally but isn't on theschedule this time because he is running for the Republicannomination for president, Gimenez said. And, he added, while therally is pro-Christian, it is not against other religions.   ``This is a Jesus rally,'' he said. ``We are not in oppositionto other religious groups. This is a free country. They can haverallies, too.''   One major difference between the coming rally and the 1980gathering is in the National Council of Churches' attitude. Eightyears ago, the council joined more than a dozen other religiousorganizations in issuing a statement accusing Washington for Jesusorganizers of trying to ``Christianize the government.''   This year, according to the Rev. Ernest Gibson, the council'sexecutive director, rally sponsors ``sought our assistance from thebeginning and they assured us that this will not just be a bigsplash and then they'll leave town.   ``They have agreed to help us develop drug treatment centersthat will be operated by local churches and they've agreed to helpdevelop and support a Christian network office that will promotefellowship among Christians and meet human needs, like those of thehomeless,'' Gibson said.   ``We've also been assured that this will not be a politicalforum for a political candidate.''   The rally will begin at 6 a.m. on Friday and last until 6 p.m.</TEXT></DOC>
