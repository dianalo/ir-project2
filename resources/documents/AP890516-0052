(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A judge who dismissed weapons chargesagainst a lawyer arrested as part of an undercover druginvestigation said law enforcement officials may have committedperjury in the case.   The false charges were filed in La Plata County Court hereagainst an undercover deputy to give the officer a reason to hirelawyer Robin Auld to defend him, District Court Judge Richard Brownsaid Monday.   ``This court is not aware of any case or statute which sanctionsthe filing of false and perjured documents in an official courtproceeding as part of an undercover operation,'' Brown wrote.   The government plan had called for the undercover officer to payAuld in drugs for his legal services, and then pressure Auld to``set up'' drug traffickers in southwest Colorado, according totestimony in previous hearings.   Auld, 43, refused to accept drugs but later took possession ofan Uzi machine gun, according to testimony. The prosecution chargedhe took the gun as payment; Auld contended he kept it as collateral.   The gun belonged to the Durango Police Department on loan fromthe FBI, according to court documents.   Auld's trial was to have started May 22 in Durango.   Brown, a visiting judge who heard the case after 6th JudicialDistrict judges in Durango disqualified themselves, said, ``Thepublic has a right to demand and to expect that the courts will dotheir utmost to remain impartial and to promote the public'sconfidence in the integrity of the courts.''   Filing the false affidavits was ``an impermissible taint uponthe integrity and impartiality of the courts,'' he wrote.   Auld said he was ``very happy'' with the ruling, but did notwant to comment because the decision might be appealed.   ``It takes guts, but it's the right thing. He (Brown) wouldn'tput up with the corruption of court records,'' said Hal Haddon,Auld's lawyer.   A notice of claim seeking at least $1 million in civil damageson Auld's behalf has been filed, but the attorney has not brought aformal lawsuit.   Keith Cross, the special prosecutor in the case, said he willappeal.   ``If this decision stands, it means the attorney never has toface a jury on fairly serious charges,'' Cross said.   Cross said he considered the false affidavits before he filedthe charges of theft by receiving and possession of a dangerousweapon against Auld.   ``In my opinion, there were no indictable offenses committed bythe DA or law enforcement officials,'' Cross said. ``There is noquestion that two documents filed and sworn to weren't true, but Ibelieve there is a difference in doing that and taking the standand perjuring themselves.''</TEXT></DOC>
