It was the first time such aprotest faltered since the uprising against Israeli occupationbegan in December.   The underground United National Leadership had called for thestrike to keep attention focused on the protest during aU.S.-Soviet summit. However, most of the Gaza Strip remained open,and transport was running in some parts of the West Bank.   Israeli leaders and some Palestinians have said support forstrikes and protests is waning.   However, in the Gaza Strip's Jabaliya refugee camp today, aprotest broke out after a 28-year-old Palestinian woman was shotand her 9-month-old daughter lost an eye from a rubber bulletduring a clash with Israeli soldiers.   Arab officials at Shifa Hospital said the woman, Najah AhmedMasoud, was shot in the left arm and her daughter, Huda, lost sightin her left eye.   Arab reports said the injuries came during a melee as Ms. Masoudtried to block soldiers from arresting her brother. The army saidit was investigating the report.   The uprising's underground leaders called for today's strike andurged their compatriots to fly the outlawed Palestinian flag thisweek as President Reagan and Mikhail S. Gorbachev meet in Moscow.   ``A complete general strike, more confrontations on the occasionof the Gorbachev-Reagan summit,'' said a leaflet issued Friday.   U.S. Ambassador Thomas Pickering told a meeting in Jersusalem onSunday that the Arab-Israeli conflict would be ``right on the topof the list'' of regional issues discussed at the Moscow summit.   Palestinian activists have said drawing attention of thesuperpowers to their plight was one victory of the uprising. Butsome also admit that support for strikes and street protests is nowdiminishing.   In the Gaza Strip today, shops were open, transit was runningand many people were out on the streets. The uprising had the mostdevastating effect in that area until today.   Arab reporters said the uprising leaders' leaflet calling fortoday's general strike did not reach the Gaza Strip. Israel radioalso reported that few Palestinians saw the leaflet.   Most businesses were closed in West Bank towns and cities and ineast Jerusalem. But many workers were reported going to jobs inIsrael and transport was running in some areas.   Palestinian flags were flying in Nablus, the West Bank's largestcity, and in Jenin. In Bethlehem, new graffiti on walls warnedmerchants not to open during the strike.   ``We are going to burn everybody who will break the strike,''one slogan said.   On Sunday, the army said Israeli soldiers shot and wounded ninePalestinians in scattered clashes with stone-throwing youths inboth Gaza and the West Bank. Arab newspapers said an Arab woman wasshot to death Sunday in the West Bank village of Jaba, whereprotesters set up roadblocks to keep out Israeli soldiers.   The army said seven protesters were shot after youths threwstones at soldiers and that it was investigating the report of thewoman's death.   An army spokeswoman said today that soldiers sealed four housesin the West Bank and demolished one house in Gaza's Rafa refugeecamp in an effort to punish Palestinians who attacked Israelisoldiers.   By U.N. count, 198 Palestinians have died during the six-monthuprising in the lands Israel seized during the 1967 Middle Eastwar. Two Israelis also have been killed.   Today's strike followed claims by Israeli leaders that theuprising was fading.   Shmuel Goren, the Israeli coordinator for the occupied lands,said in an interview published today that the uprising has made nopolitical gains but that Israel still has not quelled the angerthat fueled the violent protests.   ``There's still a way to go before we significantly underminethe motivation,'' he told The Jersualem Post.   Goren said the protests broke out spontaneously, not on ordersfrom the Palestine Liberation Organization, and that it surprisedeven many Palestinians.   He said the movement was failing because ``no alternativeinstiutions have been created, even though this was one of the maingoals of the uprising.''   On Sunday, junior high schools were opened for 70,000 West Bankyoungsters in the second stage of a program to resume classes in1,200 schools shut nearly four months ago because of the uprising.   Army officials reported no major trouble as 320 junior highsreopened. It plans to resume classes in high schools on Sunday.</TEXT></DOC>
