Javier Perez de Cuellar alsopressed Iran on the issue of Western hostages held in Lebanon.   Iran said its soldiers today crushed a force of Iraqis andIraqi-backed Iranian rebels in two days of fighting. It said 4,000enemy soldiers were killed or wounded.   The Islamic Republic News Agency said the fighting around thewestern city of Eslamabad, 60 miles from the Iraqi border,continued against ``remnants of the enemy troops'' who were``surrounded by Iranian combatants.''   In his first full day of separate truce talks with thebelligerents' foreign ministers, Perez de Cuellar met for two hoursWednesday with both Tariq Aziz of Iraq and Ali Akbar Velayati ofIran.   Aziz said Iraq, which has continued attacks on Iran despiteTehran's acceptance last week of a year-old U.N. cease-fireresolution, still wants face-to-face talks with Iran and will notbe ``stampeded'' into a settlement.   Iraq announced that it would honor Resolution 598 almostimmediately after the Security Council passed it last summer.   Perez de Cuellar said he raised with Velayati on Wednesday theissue of the 18 foreign hostages, half of them American, believedheld by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem militants in Lebanon.   ``This is a question on which one has to be very discreet,'' hetold reporters afterwards. ``I raised it very, very specifically.''   He did not disclose the Iranian envoy's response, and Velayatidid not answer questions about the hostages.   Earlier Wednesday, the U.N. chief told reporters he thought theIranians ``might assert their possible influence in order to havethis problem out of the way'' for ``humanitarian and political''reasons.   The Peruvian said he presented to both sides Wednesday the sameideas for implementing a cease-fire in the 8-year-old war and was``very sober'' in his assessment of progress. No formal meetingswere scheduled for today.   Perez de Cuellar said he could not require direct talks if Iranobjects. Iran has refused face-to-face negotiations but has leftthe door open to a request by the secretary-general.   Aziz said that if Iran does not accept direct talks ``that meansthat they are not sincere about peace.''   Some diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Iraq'sstubbornness, its continuing military offensive and its alleged useof outlawed chemical warfare were hampering negotiations.   They noted that Aziz described his official visit with thesecretary-general as a ``courtesy call,'' while U.N. officials saidit was ``substantive.''   Iranian Ambassador Mohammad Ja'afar Mahallati charged that Iraqwas procrastinating and sabotaging U.N. peace efforts. He said Iraqwas using chemical warfare, and he lodged a protest with theSecurity Council.   ``How can we take the Iraqis seriously when ... they are usingchemical weapons?'' Mahallati told reporters.   The Iranians frequently accuse Iraq of using chemical weapons,which are banned under the 1925 Geneva Convention. Iraq hasacknowledged their use, but contends Iran introduced chemicalweapons to the war.   Hashemi Rafsanjani, Iran's parliament speaker and militarycommander, offered on Tuesday to help get the nine Americanhostages freed if the United States releases Iranian assets frozensince 1979.   The White House said ``no deals.''   U.S. Ambassador Vernon A. Walters said Wednesday he believed thesecretary-general's ``good offices could help.... Things arechanging.''   Asked about Rafsanjani's statement and the U.S. response,Walters said: ``We maintain the policy that we do not pay blackmail.   Walters said he has visited Syria five times to discuss thematter and ``the important thing for us is to liberate the hostagesin such a way that they won't be replaced by another group ofhostages.''   The longest held hostage is Terry A. Anderson, 40, chief MiddleEast correspondent of The Associated Press. He was kidnapped inBeirut on March 16, 1985.   After a string of military setbacks, Iran announced on July 18that it would accept Resolution 598, which the 15-member SecurityCouncil passed unanimously on July 20, 1987.   The resolution calls for a truce, withdrawal to recognizedborders, prisoner exchange, peace negotiations and an investigationto determine which side started the war.   Iraq invaded Iraq in September 1980 after several borderskirmishes.</TEXT></DOC>
