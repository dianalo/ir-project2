The Hartford, Conn., insurance company's profit was $46.9 million, compared with $100.7 million a year earlier. Hartford Insurance is a subsidiary of ITT Corp., New York. Last week ITT said Hartford's profit declined substantially but didn't provide a figure.    Donald R. Frahm, chairman and chief executive officer, said that, excluding Thomson McKinnon, &quot;our earnings are generally down but not inconsistent with this point in the underwriting cycle.&quot;    Earnings from North American property-casualty operations fell 43% to $45.7 million, while net investment income before taxes rose 7% to $161.8 million.    Profit from international property-casualty operations rose 30% to $16.8 million, while earnings from world-wide life insurance operations rose 43% to $11.9 million. </TEXT></DOC>
