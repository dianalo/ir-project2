In a historic pact, U.S. and British negotiators yesterdayagreed to a changing of the guard at London's HeathrowAirport, the world's busiest international travel hub. Two ofthe healthiest U.S. carriers -- United Airlines and AmericanAirlines -- received permission to succeed ailing PanAmerican World Airways and Trans World Airlines in servingHeathrow. British airlines such as British Airways PLC werealso winners, gaining more access to U.S. cities.</LP><TEXT>   For travelers, the agreement is likely to mean fare cuts,more flights, fancier service and sweetened frequent-flierprograms. &quot;This is good news for the consumer on both sidesof the Atlantic,&quot; said U.S. Transportation Secretary SamuelK. Skinner, who shepherded lengthy negotiations on the issueover the weekend.   The accord &quot;ushers in a new era of trans-Atlantic airservice,&quot; said United's chairman, Stephen M. Wolf.   Yesterday's action ended a long and unusually rancoroussession of U.S.-British bargaining over Heathrow rights. Itcentered on a bilateral air service treaty, known as Bermuda2, that said only Pan Am, TWA or their &quot;corporate successors&quot;among U.S. carriers can fly into Heathrow. The new accordfrees the U.S. to name UAL Corp.'s United and AMR Corp.'sAmerican as substitutes for Pan Am and TWA at Heathrow.   In exchange, the British extracted major concessions fromthe U.S., including a laundry list of flying rights that areexpected to translate into more airline choices forconsumers. The U.S., for instance, will let a second Britishcarrier, Virgin Atlantic Airways, fly from Heathrow to theU.S. That airline, which follows the low-fare tradition ofnow-defunct carriers such as Laker Airways and PeopleExpress, is likely to bring in lower trans-Atlantic fares.   Yesterday, in fact, Virgin Atlantic cut its U.S.-Londonfares by 15%, bringing its lowest New York-London fare downto $184 one way. It made the move even though it won't bemoving its flights from London's Gatwick Airport to the morepopular Heathrow until this summer.   The British carriers also gained authority to fly to theU.S. from six other countries -- Belgium, France, Germany,Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands -- without stoppingin Britain. That means, for example, that they can flynonstop to New York from Frankfurt. Until now, the U.S. hasgenerally refused to grant such authority. The provision&quot;breaks tradition,&quot; said Jeffrey Shane, U.S. assistanttransportation secretary for policy and internationalaffairs.   The pact also is expected to mean more exposure forBritish carriers in the U.S. market as they are allowed tomake more &quot;code-sharing&quot; agreements that tie their routes tothose of U.S. carriers in computerized reservation systems.   In one of the most significant concessions to the British,United and American won't be permitted to go flat-out incompeting with British Airways. Instead, they will be limitedthis year to the number of flights already approved for PanAm and TWA, and then to modest growth for the following twoyears. After that, much faster growth will be permitted.   This was one of the most contested issues during thenegotiations because of the British government'sdetermination to shield British Airways, at leasttemporarily, from increased competition from the new Americaninvaders.   Jon Ash, managing director of Global Aviation Associates,a Washington-based consulting group, called the agreement&quot;the last building block in totally restructuring the NorthAtlantic&quot; and said it completes &quot;the transition from the oldguard to the new 900-pound gorillas -- United and American.&quot;   British Airways, facing a battle with the U.S. industrygiants, was among the few who weren't cheering the news. Itschairman, Lord King, said the changes are expected to&quot;materially&quot; reduce the airline's profitability.   In London, however, British Transport Secretary MalcolmRifkind said the agreement offers &quot;major new opportunities toBritish airlines on trans-Atlantic routes.&quot; He told theBritish Parliament that British carriers, including BritishAirways, &quot;will get an unprecedented wide range of newopportunities to compete in U.S. markets.&quot;   The pact also expands other travel options, as itsubstantially increases the number of cities in LatinAmerica, Canada and Asia that British carriers can serve fromthe U.S. For example, British Airways will be able to startnonstop service to Sydney, Australia, from Seattle. However,it didn't win clearance for nonstop service between LosAngeles and Sydney, which was its first choice. That was aparticularly contentious issue during talks.   The agreement covers United's $290 million purchase of thePan Am Corp. unit's London operations and American's proposed$445 million acquisition of TWA's London service. TheAmerican-TWA pact is still awaiting final approval by theU.S. Transportation and Justice departments.   As the quick move by Virgin Atlantic to cut faressuggests, consumers could gain big dividends from the accord,with other airlines likely to match the lower fares andintroduce other incentives as they inaugurate trans-Atlanticservice.   But fares won't be the only thing to change. BecauseBritish Airways has a reputation for good service on itsflights, United and American probably will try to compete onthat front as well, such as by strengthening business-classservice.   &quot;They're going to have to put business travelers someplacewhere they don't have kids kicking them in the back of theirseats,&quot; said Nicholas Tortorello, chairman of Research andamp;Forecasts Inc., a research firm that released a survey lastfall showing travelers believed U.S. carriers trailed foreignairlines in customer service.   Some frequent-flier program members also can expect tobenefit. Members of United's program will get an expandedbase of coverage, for instance, as the carrier is buying PanAm's rights to fly from Heathrow to many other Europeancities, and London might grow as popular as Hawaii as adestination for frequent-flier award travelers. BritishAirways also is likely to expand its minuscule frequent-flierprogram.   &quot;This is going to result in an infiltration of U.S.marketing tactics in Europe,&quot; said Timothy Pettee, atransportation analyst at Alliance Capital Management in NewYork. &quot;It definitely changes the face of trans-Atlantictravel.&quot;   The decision also staves off imminent disaster for Pan Am.&quot;Pan Am literally would have gone out of business tomorrow,&quot;said Mr. Skinner, if the agreement hadn't been reached.   The embattled airline is expected to immediately receive$290 million from United as part of its pact with thatChicago-based carrier. It will be able to pay Bankers TrustNew York Corp. the $100 million it owes in connection withfinancing arranged after it filed for Chapter 11bankruptcy-court protection in January.   Its long-term prospects are dim, however. By someestimates, the carrier will be left with only about $75million after it also pays aircraft leasing firms and othercreditors. That is considered to be enough for the carrier tooperate until summer, which is when it historically hasstarted showing a daily profit. After the summer ends,though, Pan Am could face a renewal of the cash crunch it hasendured for years during the fall and winter.   The carrier could press United into a merger or a majorpurchase of assets such as its routes to Latin America, aregion where United is near-absent. Yesterday, John C. Pope,United's chief financial officer, told Wall Street analyststhe company is interested in making such a purchase.   The Heathrow agreement &quot;has a lot of people at Pan Amwiping their brows in relief. . . . It's just what Pan Amneeds,&quot; said Raymond Neidl, an airline analyst at Dillon,Read andamp; Co.   TWA executives also were encouraged by the accord. TWAowner Carl Icahn said that while that ailing carrier &quot;stillhas a very difficult road ahead, this is certainly a positivestep in the right direction.&quot; But the carrier's pilots unionsays the sale of the lucrative London operations &quot;will leadto TWA's collapse.&quot;   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, UAL rose$2.25 to $146.75; AMR fell 62.5 cents to $57.50; Pan Am rose12.5 cents to $1.125; and British Airways' Americandepositary receipts fell $1.125 to $31.50.   ---                    Battle Over Britain                                                                                                                       BA Holds the Lion's Share...
