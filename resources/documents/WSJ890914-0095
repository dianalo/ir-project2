In Baltimore, District Judge John Hargrove, in sentencing the second defendant in the generic-drug scandal, suspended all but two months of an 18-month prison sentence given to Mr. Shah. The two months he spends in a prison work-release program will count toward the 12 months of service he will give to the American Cancer Society of Central Indiana.    Mr. Shah, a former FDA staff member and a founder of Par's Indianapolis-based Quad Pharmaceuticals Inc., pleaded guilty earlier to a charge of paying an illegal gratuity of $1,000 in 1987 to Charles Chang, a former FDA branch chief who reviewed new-drug applications.    Mr. Shah's income-tax return for 1988 shows income of about $5.5 million, including proceeds from the sale of his stake in Quad, according to a pre-sentencing memorandum sent to the judge last week by Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee's investigative panel. The panel has been probing wrongdoing in the FDA and the generics industry.    Sentencing of Par and Quad, which both have pleaded guilty to one count of paying an illegal gratuity to an FDA official, was postponed yesterday until Oct. 20. Each company faces a maximum fine of $500,000. Ashok Patel, a former Par senior vice president who pleaded guilty to giving Mr. Chang about $500, will be sentenced Oct. 17.    Of all the companies caught up in the generic scandal, Par, of Spring Valley, N.Y., has suffered some of the most severe financial setbacks. It has suspended distribution of all its generic drugs in tablet and capsule form. The 150 suspended products accounted for about 40% of Par's third-quarter revenue of $27.6 million, according to Richard Nadler, a Par vice president. At a congressional hearing Monday, FDA officials recounted several instances of bookkeeping irregularities and manufacturing problems at Par and its Quad unit.    U.S. Attorney Breckinridge Willcox, in the meantime, continues to pursue a grand jury investigation of the generic-drug scandal. Additional indictments are expected in the next few months as the investigators shift their main focus from the FDA to corporate fraud and other misdeeds.    In July, Judge Hargrove gave a three-year suspended sentence to Raj Matkari, a former vice president of Pharmaceutical Basics Inc. of Chicago, and ordered him to pay a $2,000 fine and put in 500 hours of community service. Mr. Matkari, who has cooperated with the government's investigation, pleaded guilty to paying a $2,000 gratuity to Mr. Chang in 1987. </TEXT></DOC>
