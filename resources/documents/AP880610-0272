WARREN AIR FORCE BASE, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   They call themselvesMissileers, Cold War warriors who sit 80 feet underground in atomicbomb-proof bunkers, girded for World War III.   ``Our mission is peace through deterrence,'' said Lt. MichaelLuft, 29. ``I'm a missileer because I know I'm contributing to mynation's security.''   The ties that bind are steadfast belief in the job and deepfaith that if the president of the United States orders the launchof MX and Minuteman III missiles, they'll do it.   ``Long before a possible crew member gets to (training), thatperson's reliability has been judged,'' said Luft. ``That's toinsure that individuals with only the highest amount of integrityactually man the missiles.''   The nation's 50 MX missiles are deployed alongside Interstate25, America's nuclear highway, and buried under Wyoming's highplains. The missiles are controlled by this air base in Cheyenne.   The 4,000 men and women assigned to the 90th Strategic MissileWing, including 1,200 crack security police, maintain and guard themost powerful land-based ICBMs in America's arsenal. They alsooversee 150 Minuteman IIIs.   Officers are paired off to staff 20 launch control sites aroundthe clock. Each pair, a captain and a lieutenant, are responsiblefor 10 missiles called a ``flight.''   The crews work 24-hour shifts 80 feet underground in a capsulethe size of a budget hotel room. It is suspended on shockabsorbers. No one but the crew can open its blast-proof doors.   There's a bed, television set and toilet, but the compartment isdominated by twin consoles. A bank of lights and buttons monitorsthe missiles' ``health'' every 40 seconds. It's the missileers' jobto interpret the computer diagnosis.   ``We are always busy monitoring the system,'' said Luft. ``Wedon't just sit out there with our hands on the keys.''   The keys. The heart of the matter. On each console, 12 feetapart, is a keyhole. The keys that could initiate a launch arelocked in a bright red box, along with secret papers necessary tosend the warheads on their way. Each officer has a confidentialcombination to the box. It takes both to open it.   Additionally, crews must dial a 16-digit code to ``enable'' themissiles for launch. Only the president or his successors havethose numbers.   The order to fire would come in a spoken code from the StrategicAir Command over two loudspeakers. The missileers practice thedrill constantly.   Fail-safe procedures abound. Only after the code is correctlydialed can the officers use their keys. They must be inserted andturned simultaneously, while another crew in a different capsulealso turns its two keys at the exact moment. The keyholes arespring-loaded, requiring constant key pressure to make them work.   ``Looking Glass,'' the airborne command post that routinelychecks the missiles' peacetime functions, can override any launchcommand.   ``We like redundancy in our business,'' said Lt. Col. GeraldPerryman, 39, the missile wing's assistant deputy commander foroperations. ``Every day the seals which cover the keyholes areexamined to ensure they haven't been tampered with.''   The missileers consider themselves an elite force. Currently allthose assigned to Warren AFB are men, although some female missileofficers are based at Minuteman III installations elsewhere. TheAir Force recently changed its policy to permit co-ed launchcontrol crews.   Like Luft and Perryman, Capt. Steve Wagner, 30, trains to keepin rock-hard shape. With their short haircuts, lean physiques andstarched dark-blue uniforms set off by white cravats, themissileers cut dashing figures.   ``If an officer is not pilot- or navigator-qualified, or anengineer, he's likely to be assigned to missile crew duty,'' saidPerryman. ``Missile crewmen have a good track record for promotionin competition with air crew members.''   In today's military, where space and Star Wars are toppriorities, that means ``Watch out, Top Gun, here comes TopRocket.''   By the time young officers are assigned to a launch controlcapsule, they have been put through psychological tests todetermine if they will obey orders to fire nuclear weapons.   Potential missile officers watch graphic films detailing theaftermath of the bombing of Hiroshima.   ``We also get lectures about the effects of nuclear war,'' saidWagner. ``We have to sign a statement after we view the movies.After we practice our first key turn we have to sign anotherstatement of personal reliability.''   Asked if he thought the missileers would survive incomingwarheads, Lt. Aaron Wilkins said, ``It's hard to say what wouldhappen in a degraded environment. Nobody wants that to happen.''   In a worst-case scenario, with World War III in progress and allhis missiles launched, what would Wilkins do next?   ``I don't know, it hasn't happened. I guess we would awaitfurther orders.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Thurs PMs, June 23</NOTE></DOC>
