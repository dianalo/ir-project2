U.S. Secretary of State James Baker and Japanese officialsagreed Monday night to sponsor a United Nations resolutionoutlawing the huge nets by the end of 1992. Critics say themesh nets, some as long as 30 miles, indiscriminately trapand kill most marine life in their path.</LP><TEXT>   South Korea apparently doesn't want to be left as the solemajor supporter of driftnet fishing. Although no officialstatement has been made, senior officials at the South KoreanMinistry of Foreign Affairs said Tuesday that Seoul issending a cable to its U.N. delegates advising them of ashift in Korea's position.   Japan's Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe saidTokyo changed its stand after failing to win internationalsupport for a proposal to promote conservation measures thatwould permit continued use of drift nets. The Japaneseproposal was floated as an alternative to a U.N. resolution,sponsored by the U.S. and other countries, calling for a banby June 30.   Japan, the world's largest user of drift nets, will cutback the practice by 50% by mid-1992 and drop it completelyby the end of 1992, Mr. Watanabe said. About 8,000 fishermen,many of them from northern Japan, will be affected, he said.Their fleet fishes primarily for squid in the north PacificOcean.   After Japan, South Korea and Taiwan are the world'slargest drift-netting nations. Taiwan agreed in October toabide by the U.N. resolution banning drift nets by June 30.Taiwan's decision came in the face of threatened sanctions onmillions of dollars of seafood exports to the U.S.</TEXT></DOC>
