The Economic Daily said more than 200 million of the surpluslaborers reside in overpopulated rural areas.   The report came as cities in this nation of 1 billion try to copewith a deluge of rural migrants looking for better-paying city jobs.The prosperous southern province of Guangdong has put out anemergency appeal to the state to help it handle 2.5 million mostlyrural outsiders who have flocked to the province in recent weeks.   The daily, citing a report by the China Rural DevelopmentResearch Center, said China's labor force is growing by an estimated10 million a year, outstripping the number of new jobs.   The State Statistical Bureau said earlier this week that theurban work force increased by 3.6 million last year to 135.7 million.   The report did not estimate how many of the surplus workers wouldbe unemployed. Although the government has called on businesses tooperate more efficiently, most state-run plants continue to retaintheir excess workers rather than lay them off.   Economists say 20 to 30 million of the urban work force is excessmanpower which could be cut without affecting production.   In the countryside, about 80 million peasants have left the farmto work at small rural enterprises that have shot up during the pastdecade of economic reforms.   However, many of these enterprises are now in trouble or closingdown because of inefficiency, lack of energy and basic materials, ora cutoff in credit as the government moves to slow down theoverheated economy.   The report said that while laborers exceed job opportunities inChina's underdeveloped areas, there is still a demand for labor indeveloped sections of the country.   It suggested an easing of the nation's strict residenceregulations to allow for greater worker mobility. The country shouldalso set up a special rural labor development organization toorganize rural laborers for work on the international labor market,it said.</TEXT></DOC>
