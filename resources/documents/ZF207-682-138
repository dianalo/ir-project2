 Today, however, we're going to a place much morecivilized.andP;  It's a place you would probably call &quot;America's VacationDestination&quot; if America's vacation destination weren't already claimed byNiagara Falls.andP;  Yes, today we're going to Europe.andM;I know most of you think Europe is a huge place with lots of castles, quaintcountryside, and great food.andP;  Unfortunately, this is quite a misconception.andO;Only two or three European countries have really good food.andP;  But almost allof Europe is getting a reputation for excellence in AI.andP;  In fact, if wearen't careful, Europeans could eclipse some of the work Americans are doingin AI, especially in expert systems.andM;In William Gibson's Neuromancer (a highly recommended read, by the way), theantagonists are AI systems that control a huge, worldwide empire.andP;  However,the systems aren't posited at MIT, in Palo Alto, or even in New York.andP;  Theirlocations are Bern, Switzerland, and Rio de Janeiro, Argentina.andP;  Thefictional Turing Registry for these machines resides in the U.K.andP;  Gibsoncreates a convincing story in which location means nothing; superiority does.andO;And in 1992, the countries of Europe hope to begin forging that superiority.andO;Much of what will happen in Europe will be a direct result of the formationof a united economic front.andP;  Now, whether or not you believe the Italians(who have great pasta) will openly embrace the British (who have lousy wine),or the French (who have good wine) will enjoy opening their markets to theGermans (who have lousy pasta) is as much speculation as it is any possiblereality.andM;EUROPEAN EXPERTISEandM;Europe's history in AI research is as long and illustrious as any to whichthe U.S.andP;  and it institutions can lay claim.andP;  From Sweden's University ofUppsala and Scotland's University of Edinburgh south to Marseilles,France--where PROLOG originated--many European countries have contributed tothe commercialization of AI.andM;Donald Michie of the University of Edinburgh developed one of the firstcommercial expert-system shells with Expert-Ease in the early 1980s.andP;  Despitemy belief that PROLOG is an also-ran product in the United States, I stillget calls from companies such as IBM and Logicware that claim PROLOG is aliveand well.andP;  And it's indisputable that PROLOG is alive and well in Japan andits various fifth-generation projects.andP;  Great Britain's Apricot ComputersLtd. was the first PC company to bundle speech recognition into laptophardware.andP;  It's clear that innovation abounds abroad.andM;Unisys maintains an AI research center in Paoli, Spain.andP;  IBM has its own AIcenter in Paris, which sounds like a fun place to look into expert systems,let alone just about anything else you can imagine.andP;  AI-Corp just raisedventure capital specifically to create a base of operations in Europe.andM;Companies like Cognitive Systems and Teknowledge acquired some of theirbiggest customers and investors from Europe.andP;  Cognitive has had continuingrelationships with Generale Bank, for which it created the Le Courtier stockadvisory system, and Union Bank of Switzerland.andP;  When Cimflex-Teknowledge wasoriginally founded as Teknowledge, French industrial giants Elf Aquitaine andFramatone invested a sizable chunk of the start-up financing.andP;  Systran, themachine translation company, is owned by a French industrial-valvemanufacturer.andP;  Carnegie Group has an expert-system agreement with Olivetti ina joint venture known as Delos.andP;  Based in Italy, Delos provides products tothe European manufacturing, aerospace, and defense markets, focusing onknowledge-based diagnostic systems.andM;These examples illustrate the U.S.andP;  involvement with European companies.andP;  Butcompanies like Intelligent Environments Ltd. are hoping to change the face ofthat arrangement by coming to America.andP;  The company markets Crystal, aPC-based expert-system shell, allegedly the most popular shell in Europe.andP;  InApril 1989, Framentec, the AI branch of Teknowledge investor Framatone,acquired another French AI company called Cognitech, creating an AI companyas large as any AI software company in the U.S.andP;  This single AI entitycreated from two smaller ones claims to have the highest number ofoperational shells installed in France and Europe as well as more than 100employees.andM;ESPRIT DE CORPSandM;Many of the largest high-tech companies in Europe have AI operations, such asSiemens, Groupe Bull, and Olivetti.andP;  Many more are actively involved inexpert-system application development, such as Daimler Benz, BMW,Aerospatiale, British Petroleum, Thomson, and Shell.andP;  These same companiesalso participate in various European versions of The Fifth GenerationProject.andP;  The U.K.'s original projects took the form of ESPRIT and Alvey.andO;European Strategic Program for Research in Information Technologies (ESPRIT)is a consortium of European countries involved in more than 100 separateprojects in technology research and development.andP;  Funding is supplied byindustry and government at around $1.3 billion for a five-year plan.andM;The U.K.andP;  has its own particular project called the Alvey Project (namedafter John Alvey, the U.K.'s telecommunications pioneer), which was funded at$470 million.andP;  The Scandinavian countries have a $12 million, four-yearprogram set up by the Nordic Council of Ministers and another NordicCooperative Organization for Applied Research (Nordforsk).andP;  France has anumber of joint research projects divided among the French Ministry ofResearch and Technology, L'Agence de l'Informatique, and the Posts andTelecommunications Industry and amounting to more than $100 million.andM;ESPRIT also announced a new joint technology project in early 1989concentrating on neural-net research.andP;  The new program, the Application ofNeural Networks for the Industry in Europe, has the most interesting acronymto come down the pike in a while--ANNIE.andP;  The $6 million project will becommissioned to create a strong European presence in neural nets.andP;  Companiesinvolved in ANNIE are France's Cetim, Greece's Alpha and NTU, the F.R.D.'sSiemens, and British Aerospace.andP;  (I'm really tempted to make a neural-netcrack here about Little Orphan ANNIE, but I'll skip it.)andM;The Europeans are making strides in other areas of AI that have not receivedmuch attention in the U.S.andP;  For instance, Munich's Armed Forces Universityhas developed an &quot;autonomobile.&quot;andP;  Using image processing and machine visiontogether in real time, the product allegedly was tested at 60 m.p.h.andP;  on aroad, moving driverless around obstacles placed in its path.andP;  Though thisresembles DARPA's development of an autonomous land vehicle, the fact thatthe university tests it at high speeds on open roads leads me to wonderwhether Mercedes will create a car that literally gives drivers the option ofbeing asleep at the wheel.andM;TRAVELLING IN EUROPEandM;As is true all over the world, AI is used extensively in the Europeanfinancial community.andP;  But since I promised that today we are going to Europe,it's only fair that we examine the way AI is applied in the transportationindustries.andP;  Among the examples of AI in Europe:andM;* A system for the Portugese railway has been created by a Portugese AI firm,Consultes e Servicos em Sistemas Cognitivos (SISCOG).andP;  The company handles&quot;applicacoes de intelligencie artificiel e sistemes periciais.&quot;andP;  Europeancountries rely more heavily on rail transport than, say, cars or planes.andO;Train scheduling is nightmare enough, but scheduling crews for each of thosetrains presents its own hell.andP;  Most rail systems rely on a core group ofexperts to develop schedules, generate work shifts, determine which crew iscapable of handling which type of train, provide alternative scheduling inunusual or emergency situations, and make sure work schedules conform tounion-related guidelines.andM;Using this group of experts, SISCOG developed a LISP-based expert systemcalled CREWS.andP;  The package, which cost $800,000, generates reports for workshifts based on these criteria.andP;  It also creates statistical analysisenabling evaluation and quantification of the cost of the solution itgenerates.andP;  Sounds almost like a self-validating system, doesn't it?andP;  If somepeople I know were forced to create reports justifying their workproductivity, the unemployment office would be busier than Grand CentralStation.andM;* SAS, the Scandinavian travel company that owns SAS Airlines, also ownshotels throughout Europe.andP;  Its current project is to deploy an expert systemfor determining yield and controlling property management in its hotels.andP;  Inan unusual turnaround, the company is using the SIHRES hotel system that wasdeveloped by Action Software of San Diego, Calif.andM;* Air France has developed an expert system for the diagnostics of airplanestarters.andP;  The application was developed by the French company JoyInformatique, which markets the similarly unusual-sounding &quot;Plaisir d'Expert&quot;nliterally, &quot;pleasure of the expert&quot;) range of expert-system generators.andM;* The Port of Marseilles uses a tool from S20 Development for diagnosingharbor cranes for cargo unloading.andP;  The company is also working with theParis metro and bus system to develop applications for mass transit.andM;EUROSMARTSandM;My favorite application to come out of Europe, however, was developed by aFrench company called Infosys--a system called Spirit of Tao.andP;  Thisapplication is a diagnostic tool for acupuncturists.andP;  It guides practitionersthrough consultations with patients and proposes two types of therapy (theFive Elements and the Great Tradition), determines possibility and risks ofcondition relapse, and even prints out a report on the consultation.andP;  Thisapplication seems fairly--how shall I say?--whimsical, until you realize theimportance of acupuncture in Asian cultures.andP;  And considering that roughlyone-third of the world's population is Asian, automated acupuncturists couldsomeday generate quite an interest.andM;Theroughout Europe, an estimated 100 companies, primarily in the U.K.,andO;France, and Italy, are active in commercial expert-system product developmentand marketing.andP;  But as the European economic community heads for unification,some of these players will become more active in marketing products in theU.S.andP;  And though I don't think we'll ever switch AI to AI (the Frenchinitials for &quot;intelligence artificielle&quot;), a stronger Europe will certainlychange the way America has been managing intelligent machines, n'est-ce pas?andM;Harvey P.
