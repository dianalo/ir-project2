Airbus, Western Europe's aerospace consortium, confirms it has been talking to the Soviet carrier Aeroflot and to a number of other Soviet bloc airlines about buying its advanced aircraft. This commerical &quot;Ostpolitik&quot; has the fervent support of West Germany, which is pursuing its own political opening to the East.    But any sale would have to gain the approval of the 16-nation Coordinating Committee on Export Controls, or Cocom, the group responsible for plugging high-technology leaks to the Communist countries. And Cocom, which is holding a high-level meeting tomorrow to review some of its embargo procedures and tighten enforcement, has been particularly vigilant since last year's discovery that a unit of Toshiba Corp. of Japan had supplied the Soviets with advanced machine tools.    All the Western aircraft builders make regular sales calls in the East, even though opportunities are limited. Some have sewn up agreements with Cocom's blessing. China has Boeing Co. equipment and co-produces aircraft with McDonnell Douglas Corp. in a Chinese factory. Romania makes British Aerospace PLC's BAC-111 model under license in Bucharest. But in cases like these, the technology either was judged old enough to share, or special arrangements were made.    Airbus professes little concern about Cocom restrictions. A spokesman in Toulouse, France, said they are &quot;a hurdle that has to be cleared. But it's not foreseen as an insurmountable one.&quot;    The spokesman declined to comment on a West Berlin newspaper's report that the East German carrier Interflug will lease four Airbus aircraft starting late this year. He confirmed that Airbus is engaged in preliminary sales talks with Interflug and other unspecified East bloc carriers.    The idea of Airbus sales to the East bloc isn't new, but skeptics doubt the current talks will come to anything. A French government official noted that the Soviets have been talking to Airbus for years. &quot;What they want,&quot; he said, isn't airplanes per se, but &quot;to be able to get the maximum information about our technology.&quot;    Others say Cocom remains a big obstacle. &quot;There have been talks for 10 or 15 years of selling to the East bloc,&quot; said one European aerospace executive. &quot;We'd like to do business with them.&quot; But the current Cocom restrictions would block any proposed sale, he said, and the rules aren't likely to change soon.    Nevertheless, despite Cocom restrictions and the scarcity of hard currency in the East bloc, Airbus and the U.S. manufacturers continue to pitch their planes and hope for an opening. McDonnell Douglas said it has had talks with Malev Hungarian Airlines in the past year, as has British Aerospace. Boeing confirmed it demonstrated a 767 in November for LOT Polish Airlines and the Romanian airline Tarom. After Airbus got wind of that, a Boeing spokesman said, Airbus did some demonstrations of its own. The result: &quot;We're both in there hot and heavy,&quot; he said.    West German officials are pressing Cocom to loosen its controls. &quot;No responsible Western politician wants to endanger Western security interests,&quot; Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher told the European Parliament in Strasbourg last week. But the Cocom limitations &quot;go beyond what is necessary,&quot; he said.    Export-oriented German businesses need new markets now that the weak dollar is hurting their U.S. exports. Hanns Arnt Vogels, chairman of Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm G.m.b.H., said recently that Airbus should try to get East bloc sales contracts.    MBB is Airbus's German partner. (The other Airbus owners are Aerospatiale of France, British Aerospace and Spain's Construcciones Aeronauticas S.A.) </TEXT></DOC>
