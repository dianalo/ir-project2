 Third-party vendorsbegan marketing their own fonts and in 1985 Altsys released thefirst commercial font editor, FONTastic.andP;  After the appearance ofLaserWriter, the font market exploded.andP;  But then an unforeseenproblem arose: font ID conflicts.andP;  Apple had designed theMacintosh to include numbering for only 256 individual font names,half for itself and half for third-party vendors.andP;  Third-partyvendors were forced to assign the same ID number to differentfonts in order to put all of their fonts on the market.andP;  Font-DAMover and New FoNT were developed in order to resolve some ofthese numbering problems.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Product:   Apple Macintosh (Microcomputer) (computer programs).andO;Topic:     FontsDesktop publishingHistory of Computing.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Fonts by NumberandM;When the first Macintosh shipped in 1984, it came with ten resident fonts:Geneva, New York, Chicago, Monaco, San Francisco, Athens, Toronto, Cairo,London, and Venice.andP;  That was an embarrassment of riches, giving users thepower to be typographically versatile or atrocious.andP;  The Mac wasn't the firstcomputer to offer a choice of fonts, both on-screen and on paper, but it wasthe first to offer so much power to so many people.andM;Apple also supplied Mac purchasers with Font Mover.andP;  This small utilityprogram let users remove certain font sizes or even whole fonts from theirSystem file, making it smaller and more useful in those days of single drivesand 400K floppies.andP;  People soon started thinking about making their ownfonts, but thinking was all they could do, because there was no way to createa font.andM;Then a buggy Font Editor leaked out of Cupertino, and a few hardy souls beganto build and modify fonts.andP;  Companies such as Miles Computing and KensingtonMicroware began marketing third-party fonts (their fonts were actuallycreated by Xiphias).andP;  Public-domain fonts started to appear on electronicbulletin boards.andP;  Apple improved Font Editor and eventually replaced it withResEdit, which had font-editing capabilities built in.andM;Identity CrisisandM;In 1985 Altsys released FONTastic, the first commercial font editor.andO;FONTastic enabled anyone to alter existing bit-mapped fonts or to createentire new ones; it's still available as the much-improved FONTastic Plus(see DTP, May '89).andP;  New fonts were soon appearing by the dozen; the fontfloodgates didn't really open, however, until the birth of the LaserWriterand the accompanying on-slaught of PostScript fonts.andM;This tidal wave of fonts created a totally unforeseen problem: font IDconflicts.andP;  You select a font from the Font menu, and the screen shows thecorrect size of a completely different font.andP;  Or you drop off a newsletter atthe local service bureau and return to discover a mishmash of strangetypefaces.andM;These conflicts occur because the Mac pays attention only to theidentification number attached to each font name.andP;  It doesn't care at allthat New Jersey and California have different names.andP;  If they have the sameID number, they have an identity crisis.andM;How can two fonts have the same ID number?andP;  Because Apple didn't foresee thepublic's thirst for fonts.andP;  Its design for the Mac included numbering foronly 256 individual font names.andP;  In fact, Apple reserved half the ID numbersfor itself and told third-party developers that they could use the other 128.andM;Naturally, the number of fonts quickly exceeded the available IDs.andP;  Thousandsof Mac fonts are obtainable, all vying for the same 256 ID numbers.andP;  Theconflicts arise not just among fonts marketed by different manufacturers, buteven within a single company.andP;  Adobe's rapidly expanding font library hasforced it to use the same ID number for more than one font.andM;Font/DA Mover, which replaced Font Mover in 1985, can resolve some numberingconflicts, but's no panacea.andP;  All it does is automatically change the IDnumber of a font being installed if it matches one already in place.andP;  Thesechanges are invisible to the user, so you have no way of knowing when aconflict occurs.andM;The Numbers GameandM;As mentioned, each font has an identifying number in the range 0 to 255.andP;  Forexample, Geneva is font 3.andP;  This ID number is usually assigned arbitrarily bythe font maker (Apple assigned numbers for the first fonts), which increasesthe risk of numbering conflicts.andM;To complicate matters further, each style variation (bold, italic, and so on)is considered a separate font and so must have a separate ID number.andO;Palatino, B Palatino Bold, and I Palatino Italic must be installedseparately, show up separately on Font menus, and require separate IDnumbers.andP;  (Apple doesn't ship styled screen fonts with the Mac.andP;  Withoutthem, the styles that you seen on-screen are merely altered versions of theplain font and don't accurately predict the printed results.andP;  True bold,italic, and bold-italic screen fonts are available from Adobe and other fontmakers.)andM;Each size of each font also has a second number associated with it, becauseit's stored in the Mac as an ordinary System resource.andP;  For the early fonts,this resource type is named, naturally enough, FONT.andP;  Each font size has itsown separate FONT resource, and each FONT resource has a unique number from 0to 32767, the maximum value allowed for a resource number.andM;FONT resource-number generation involves a simple mathematical formula.andP;  Youmultiply the font's ID number by 128 and add the font size to the result.andO;For example, the FONT number for 10-point Geneva is (3 x 128) + 10, or 394.andO;The resource number for 12-point Geneva is 396.andP;  Peignot Bold is font 200;the FONT resource number for its 36-point version is (200 x 128) + 36, or25636.andM;FONT FamiliesandM;In 1986, Apple brought out the Mac Plus, with its 128K ROM.andP;  This larger ROMallowed Apple to introduce a new type of resource, the FOND (from FONt familyDescriptor).andP;  The FOND was created to tie together all the sizes and stylesof a font family, and it carries the same ID number as the font name (seeFigure 1).andP;  It's basically a table of information about a font family,including the resource numbers of all related FONTs, both plain and styled,and the associated character-width and kerning-pair data.andM;Styled fonts had separate FONDs, but they were tied to the main family FOND.andO;Thus, if you specified 12-point Garamond Bold, the Mac would go first to theGaramond FOND to locate the address of the Garamond Bold FOND and then tothat FOND to find the resource number for the point size.andM;Because font families were now linked, you could select Italic from the Stylemenu and get a true italic font on-screen, instead of a slanted version ofthe plain font.andP;  You no longer had to choose the actual styled font directlyfrom the Font menu (although you still had to have it installed).andP;  FONDssolved some problems but not the 256-font restriction.andP;  FONT resources werestill there, growing by leaps and bounds.andP;  Incredibly, some desktoppublishers tried to load more than 256 different fonts into their Systems.andO;They didn't succeed.andM;Enter NFNTandM;The Mac Plus also contained another new font resource, although it wentvirtually unnoticed.andP;  The NFNT (from New FoNT) is structurally the same as aFONT, except that its number is not tied to a formula based on font numberand point size.andP;  Thus, an NFNT resource number can range freely from 1025 to32767.andP;  (Actually, 256 to 1024 are also legal numbers, but Apple has reservedthem.)andM;More importantly, the ID number of a font (and its FOND) also has an upperlimit of 32767 -- a long way from the previous 256-font ceiling.andP;  Inpractical terms, that means the Mac can now use thousands of different fontswithout conflicts.andP;  Now that's a workable limit!andM;Another benefit of NFNTs is that the bold, italic, and bold-italic styles canbe merged with the &quot;plain&quot; (or roman) font.andP;  A single FOND can reference allfour styles in a font family, which also means that only one ID number isrequired, instead of the previous four (see Figure 2).andP;  On Font menus, thefamily name appears only once -- as Helvetica, for example.andP;  No longer areyour eyes assailed by B Helvetica Bold, BI Helvetica Bold Italic, and IHelvetica Italic.andP;  This system makes for learner and meaner Font menus.andM;The only drawback is that, even with NFNTs, a FOND can accommodate only fourstyle variations.andP;  Large font families with styles such as demibold and lightmust still be split into subfamilies.andM;Of course, even with 32,767 ID numbers available, conflicts can occur.andP;  Tominimize the chances of ID overlap, Apple has established a font-ID registryand is issuing blocks of NFNT numbers on request to font makers.andP;  Severalcompanies, such as AGFA Compugraphic, are participating in this&quot;clearinghouse&quot; effort.andM;Since NFNTs are clearly the answer to most, if not all, of the Mac's fontwoes, you might assume that they're universally used and that FONTs are athing of the past.andP;  Unfortunately, that's not the case.andP;  Older Macs with 64KROMs don't recognize NFNTs and so are stuck with the 256-font limit of FONTs.andM;In addition, most font makers have been slow to jump on the NFNT bandwagon.andO;Bitstream's MacFontware has used the NFNT scheme since it shipped last year,but the reigning monarch of Mac type, Adobe, announced its support of NFNTsonly in March.andP;  Adobe plans to reissue its font library with NFNT numberingin the near future.andP;  Linotype also recently unveiled the Concert Series, anew version of its type library that &quot;harmonizes&quot; fonts via the NFNT system.andM;Until recently, many applications couldn't handle NFNTs either.andP;  They ignoredthem or substituted another font such as Geneva.andP;  Even that old war-horseFont/DA Mover has lagged in this regard.andP;  Version 3.8 released a year ago, isthe first to properly handle NFNTs.andP;  Be sure you have 3.8 if you'reinstalling NFNTs.andM;Font ManagementandM;You don't have to settle for the status quo where your fonts are concerned.andO;Want to see the ID numbers of your fonts?andP;  Shareware utilities such as FontFinder, FontDisplay, and DAFont were created expressly for this purpose.andO;FONTastic Plus and Olduvai's N-Font both convert FONTs to NFNTs with aminimum of fuss.andP;  FONTastic Plus also lets you change ID numbers andconsolidate font families into a single FOND (see Figure 3).andM;But the cream of the font-handling crop are Suitcase and Font/DA Juggler,both of which appeared in mid-1987.andP;  Although these programs (both are SystemINITs) differ in exactly how they work their magic, both provide the samebottom line.andP;  They let you use very large numbers of fonts -- far above the256-font ceiling -- very easily.andP;  (They also remove the Apple-imposed limitof 15DAs.) It's the rare hard-disk owner who doesn't use one of theseprograms.andM;Recent upgrades to both programs allow them to handle NFNTs as well as FONTs.andO;MasterJuggler can display a font list in which each font name appears in theactual font (see Quick Clicks, March '89).andP;  Suitcase II takes that idea a bitfurther, allowing you to have each font name in every Font menu appear in theactual font (see Quick Clicks, June '89).andM;Both programs come with additional utilities that let you manipulate andoptimize your existing font files.andP;  MasterJuggler's have both manualrenumbering and automatic options, and the Suitcase II utilities work purelyin an automatic mode (see sidebar, &quot;Juggling Suitcases&quot;).andM;Names, Not NumbersandM;Of course, the simplest solution to the font-numbering chaos would be to haveapplications refer to fonts by name, not number.andP;  Then it wouldn't matter ifGoudy and Palatino shared the same ID number or if your ID number forGalliard differed from your service bureau's.andM;Apple is encouraging developers to do just that.andP;  Several programs --PageMaker 3.01, Ready,Set,Go!andP;  4.5, MacDraw II, and FreeHand, to name a few-- now store font information by name.andP;  Thus, font-ID conflicts are avoided,no matter what machine you use or what the actual font-ID numbers are.andO;Within a year or so, most programs will be calling fonts by name.andP;  When thathappens, the typographic freedom the first Macs promised will finally havearrived.andM;Avoiding ConflictandM;Before you convert to NFNTs, be sure your software recognizes them.andO;Otherwise, the fonts may be ignored or converted to Geneva or Chicago.andM;If you renumber your fonts, you may have problems with older files that werecreated under the prvious numbering system.andP;  If you don't want to spend timereselecting fonts, keep a suitcase of fonts with the original numberingscheme.andM;Check with service bureaus to see how they want you to handle your fonts.andP;  Asadded insurance, always provide a list of your fonts and a draft printout ofyour job to show what you expect.andM;In an office situation with shared Macs and files, everyone should use thesame set of System fonts (or a common font suitcase).andM;Font-ID conflicts can occur among fonts installed in applications, theSystem, and font suitcases.andP;  In the event of such a conflict, anapplication's fonts get priority, followed by those in the System and thensuitcases.andP;  Avoid cross-conflicts by putting all your fonts in one place --or use FONTastic Plus, Suitcase's Font Harmony, or MasterJuggler's ResourceResolver to renumber conflicting fonts.andM;Be sure you don't have the same font families installed in your System andfont suitcases, because only one family FOND can be recognized at a time.andP;  Ifyou have Palatino in your System and then open a suitcase file containing anyversion of that font, the newly opened Palatino FOND will override theSystem's version, causing it to disappear.andP;  Closing the suitcase will restorethe System's Palatino.andP;  In general, the most recently opened FOND takesprecedence.andM;Juggling SuitcasesandM;Font/DA Mover is the font-manipulation tool everyone has -- it comes with theApple System software.andP;  It lets you add and delete fonts and DAs from yourSystem file (or any other file, for that matter).andM;It has always been a problem-ridden application.andP;  Some versions didn't likegargantuan font files, the kind that hold fonts with large point sizes, andposted cryptic error messages.andP;  Other versions simply froze when asked tomove lots of large files.andP;  Some versions simply didn't resolve all numberingconflicts, causing later crashes.andP;  And, most embarrassing of all, Font/DAMover couldn't deal with NFNTs for the first two years of their existence.andM;You should always follow a few simple rules when working with Font/DA Mover.andM;* Work on a backup copy of your files.andP;  You're dealing with System files;never work on originals.andM;* Always use the newest version of Font/DA Mover (currently 3.8).andP;  Never useversion 3.6 or lower.andM;* If you have only 512K or 1 megabyte of RAM, work in small batches.andP;  Don'ttry to move more than 200K at a time.andM;If Font/DA Mover is the font-manipulation tool everyone has, Suitcase II orMasterJuggler is the font tool everyone should have.andP;  Both are INIT files,and picking one or the other is pretty much a matter of preference.andP;  If youfrequently use PageMaker and a laser printer, get Suitcase II.andP;  The currentversion of MasterJuggler works only with applications that use Apple'sLaserWriter drivers (PageMaker uses AldusPrep).andM;Both programs come with utility software that enhances their performance.andO;Suitcase II comes with Font andamp; Sound Valet and Font Harmony, and MasterJugglercomes with Resource Resolver and Font/DA Utility.andM;Font andamp; Sound Valet compresses the size of font files from 25 to 60 percent.andO;Since the compressed files are usable only by Suitcase II, you should keepbackup copies of the original, uncompressed fonts.andM;Both Resource Resolver and Font Harmony resolve font-numbering conflicts,even if the fonts are stored in several different files.andP;  Font Harmony canmerge the style variations of a font family so that only the family nameappears in the Font menu.andP;  It's also capable of inspecting font files fordefects and, in most cases, fixing them.andP;  Some early Adobe fonts (thosereleased through May 1988) have structural defects that don't prevent youfrom using them but that do cause problems if the files are altered.andP;  FontHarmony can patch the code.andM;MasterJuggler's Font/DA Utility is a more versatile application, resemblingAltsys' FONTastic Plus.andP;  It can rename and renumber fonts, combine the stylevariations in a font family, and convert FONTs to NFNTs.andM;Finally, there's N-Font, a free utility from Olduvai.andP;  All it does is convertFONTs to NFNTs, but the current version (1.01) does an excellent job with allcurrently available fonts.andP;  You really don't need N-Font, especially if youhave MasterJuggler or FONTastic Plus, but it's an excellent application ifyou have lots of fonts in FONT format and want to convert them to NFNTsquickly.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
