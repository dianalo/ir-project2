The decision came at a hastily arranged meeting in Washingtoncalled by Teamsters President William J. McCarthy, who on Fridaysummoned the union's 16 vice presidents to discuss the settlementoffer, said one source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.   ``We said no, we rejected it,'' said the source, who declined todiscuss the substance of the meeting.   ``That's right, it was rejected,'' said another participant inthe meeting, who agreed to confirm the outcome of the meeting on thecondition he not be identified.   Word of the decision came hours after one Teamster leader whoreportedly would have been forced out under the settlement announcedhis resignation. A second union vice president also reportedlyresigned Saturday.   ``It is with deep regret that I leave this International Unionand especially its membership,'' Robert Holmes, second vicepresident of the Teamsters, said in a statement released by hisunion office in Detroit.   Holmes, in his resignation statement, said he wanted to spendmore time with his family.   He also referred to a rift in the union leadership that hasexisted since McCarthy edged out Teamsters Secretary-TreasurerWeldon Mathis last year in the race to succeed the late JackiePresser as Teamsters president.   The statement said the ``unwillingness'' of the union's governingboard ``to effectuate the reforms'' proposed by Holmes, Mathis andothers ``have made his participation on the general executive boarda continuing source of frustration.''   The Cleveland Plain Dealer, quoting a union source, reported inSunday editions that John H. Cleveland of Washington also resignedhis post as a Teamsters vice president.   Both Holmes and Cleveland were on the losing side last year whenMcCarthy, then head of the Teamsters in New England, defeatedMathis, Presser's hand-picked successor, in a 9-8 vote.   The unprecedented racketeering suit brought by the JusticeDepartment maintains the 1.6-million member Teamsters union'sleadership is rife with mob-sponsored corruption.   The case is scheduled for trial Feb. 27, but U.S. AttorneyRudolph Giuliani, who is resigning, reportedly has proposed asettlement that calls for a number of internal union reforms and theresignations of several of the vice presidents.   The Plain Dealer, which in its Saturday editions first reportedMcCarthy's calling the meeting, quoted a Teamsters source as sayingGiuliani was ``hot to trot'' to settle the suit before leavingoffice.   Telephone calls to Teamsters headquarters in Washington onSaturday went unanswered.   A third source, speaking earlier Saturday to The AssociatedPress, said, ``McCarthy called them together to talk it over, to seehow they feel about settling.'' That source said he had no detailsof the proposed settlement and did not know whether all 16 vicepresidents traveled to Washington for the meeting.   The Plain Dealer said the proposal calls for direct elections oftop Teamsters officials, with an independent panel named to overseethe process. The officials now are elected at a convention ofdelegates, a process law enforcement officials allege has beeninfluenced at times by organized crime leaders.   The Los Angeles Times reported last week that Giuliani, as partof a proposed settlement, was demanding the resignations of five ofthe 16 international vice presidents. The newspaper identifiedHolmes as one of the five and said the other four are HaroldFriedman of Cleveland, Joseph Trerotola of New York, Joseph Morganof Hallandale, Fla., and Ted R. Cozza of Pittsburgh.   Spokeswoman Deborah Corley said Giuliani's office would neitherconfirm nor deny reports of a proposed settlement and had no furthercomment on the case.   In an interview published this month in the union's newsletter,The International Teamster, McCarthy predicted the union would winthe case.   ``Every single member of the general executive board is committedto fighting the insulting accusations and personal attacks that havebeen leveled against us,'' McCarthy was quoted as saying. ``I knowwe're going to win this because we're right and right will triumphin the end.''   The suit was filed seven months ago under the RacketeerInfluenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. It asks that the courtoust the Teamsters leadership and place the union under courttrusteeship.   More than two dozen reputed organized crime figures were named asdefendants in addition to the union, then-President Presser, 16Teamsters vice presidents and a former vice president. Two of thevice presidents named in the suit have since resigned. McCarthy wasthird vice president when the suit was filed.   The suit contends that the alleged mob figures were aided andabetted by Teamsters officials, including McCarthy, in controllingactivities of the union through racketeering. It lists convictionsin Teamster-related crimes dating back more than 25 years to supportthe allegations.   Ten of the reputed Mafia leaders were dropped as defendants inOctober after signing agreements in which they promised to avoidfuture dealings with the Teamsters.</TEXT></DOC>
