(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>This is the fourth of five reports on networking, part of DATAMATION'Songoing Systems andamp; Strategies for the '90s program.andP;  The remaining part willbe an interview with Howard Frank of Network Management Inc.andM;Single-site databases are becoming too expensive, slow and limited.andP;  Needed:secure, distributed databases with real-time updating and standardized querylanguages.andM;Today's network users would like nothing less than to have all informationsources available across all networks in real time.andP;  They want systems thatovercome the barrier of multiple vendors, media and locations.andP;  To accomplishthat, information systems workers will have to master a new technology:distributed database management.andM;In a truly distributed environment, databases themselves can be divided sothat pieces can be physically located closest to where the data will be used.andO;In order to be usable, the data must all be of the same version, so updatingthat data in real time will be essential to realizing maximum productivity,especially in applications such as transaction processing.andM;Users are also calling for a standard version of Structured Query Language(SQL), which will allow them to move easily between databases from differentvendors.andP;  And they're looking for gateways that will allow them to buildbridges between different database generations.andM;As distributed database technology evolves, companies will be able to moveaway from sole reliance on single-site databases built around mainframes.andO;The move will be toward a network of locally placed, but globally accessible,databases on different classes of computers.andP;  The promise of distributeddatabases is to provide universal access to remote network databases whilereducing investments in large system hardware.andP;  Price/ performance ratios areexpected to rise significantly as networks move away from mainframe systems,particularly older hierarchical database management system (DBMS).andM;Ideally, users of DBMSS Will be able to move seamlessly between multipledatabases.andP;  &quot;The point of distributed databases should be to allow the datato be physically distributed and reside on different types of databases butlook like all one database to the user.andP;  It should act and be seen as onesingle system,&quot; says Eric Wasiolek, manager of distributed product marketingat Alameda, Calif.-based Ingres Corp.andM;Two major factors limit database distribution today: the location of thehardware and the variety of database software.andP;  Users accessing the databasecan be on a single local network, at a specific remote location or broadlydistributed.andP;  On the software side, various databases may run under the samesoftware (homogeneous) or different, even incompatible, software(heterogeneous).andP;  Wasiolek believes that distributed databases are followinga step-wise evolution (see box, &quot;Databases Move Toward DistributedTechnology&quot;).andM;&quot;Local homogeneous access was the first.andP;  Some gateways now provide localheterogeneous access.andP;  Remote homogeneous and heterogeneousaccess-client/server applications-are starting now.andP;  Later, we'll seephased-in access to true distributed homogeneous and heterogeneousdatabases.&quot;andM;&quot;The long-term, real benefits to distributed database management systems,&quot;says Wayne Kernochan, senior analyst for distributed systems at the YankeeGroup in Boston, &quot;will come when we can move the data around to where it isneeded, in a flow that matches the company's organizational structure.andM;Today, network managers and users are making their first moves toward thismodel by breaking database network functions into client/server applications.andO;But this is only one aspect of distributed database management.andP;  Access tomultiple homogeneous databases is already commonplace, and vendors such asIngres, Microsoft Corp. of Redmond, Wash., and Oracle Corp. of Belmont,Calif., offer gateways into competing vendors' DBMS software.andM;Dwayne Walker, product manager for SQL Server at Microsoft, sees three phasesfor distributed database implementation in the next decade: &quot;The first waveis distributed query capability, which we are starting to address now.andP;  Thesecond wave will be distributed query and updating on homogeneous databases.andO;The third wave will be distributed query and updating on heterogeneousdatabases.&quot;andM;Network managers and database software vendors all seem to be taking the sameapproach as Jeffrey Kent, the manager of computer-integrated engineering atAllen-Bradley Co.'s Industrial Computer and Communications Group in HighlandHeights, Ohio.andP;  His philosophy toward distributed database applications isthis: &quot;You have to eat an elephant one bite at a time.&quot;andM;First FruitsandM;With his first few bites, Kent already has measured significant savingsdirectly attributable to a newly synchronized database approach inAllen-Bradley's design and manufacturing process.andP;  The Milwaukee-baseddivision of Rockwell International Corp. is using the distributed approach toovercome the inefficiencies inherent in having two different unreconciledsystems dedicated to a common manufacturing process.andM;&quot;We have cut board assembly from 15 days down to three days.andP;  And engineeringchanges that used to take one to three weeks now take three hours.andP;  Thedesign cycle has been cut from 52 weeks to 26 weeks.andP;  We've reduced directlabor costs by 70% and improved our time-to-market by 35%, because thedatabase allows us to make the designs available to other parts of thecompany faster.andP;  That was a key point for us.&quot;andM;Kent is looking forward to a more fully distributed DBMS approach usingreal-time updating as the products become available.andP;  &quot;Distributed databasesare going to be an absolute necessity to the enterprise,&quot; he says.andO;&quot;Everything is motivated by a business reason.andP;  problem for us; we aren'tdoing this because it is the trend.&quot;andM;Five years ago, Kent helped set up new production plant for programmablecontrollers.andP;  He did a study of all the automated information flows indesign, engineering and manufacturing for the low volume, high-product-mixoperation.andM;&quot;I thought we needed better network ing, but what I found was that thenetworking was good-almost There was no control of the information.&quot; Thoseusing computer-aided design (CAD) tools, says Kent, were often working ondifferent versions of the same design without receiving updates.andM;&quot;Databases are not just for MIS.andP;  They need to be applied to the productdesign process, as well,&quot; says Kent.andP;  &quot;We found a lot of redundant andincorrect information between the mainframe database and the CAD system, withno one knowing which versions were correct.andP;  Corporate MIS came in to helpus.andP;  We needed a single database that was distributed throughout theprocess.&quot;andM;Although the firm's material requirements planning (MRP) system is on an IBM3090 in Milwaukee, the design environment containing specifications for thecompany's more than 7,000 electronic components resides on a VAXcluster inthe Twinsburg, Ohio, plant.andP;  The design center has over 350 workstations andincludes Dos-based PCs, Apple Macintoshes, Digital VAXs and UNIX-basedmachines.andP;  In addition, the Twinsburg plant has 50 workstations.andM;It took three years to convince management that a single database was thebest route to take.andP;  Proof finally arrived one day when production came to ascreeching halt at the Twinsburg plant.andP;  The bill of materials system at theplant was using one version of a new product about to go into production, butthe CAD system was using another version.andM;&quot;The two separate databases weren't synchronized.andP;  We couldn't go intoproduction.andP;  About 200 people sat around with nothing to do, and it cost alot,&quot; says Kent.andM;Running a database in different computer environments created one of thebiggest challenges.andP;  &quot;We needed a multi-platform database package,&quot; saysKent.andP;  &quot;And although a lot of vendors make a big deal about offeringdistributed database functions, the biggest vendors with those capabilitiesare Oracle Corp. and Ingres Corp. We chose Oracle because of a previouscommercial relationship.&quot;andM;The first stage of the implementation was to put all the necessaryinformation onto Oracle databases.andP;  These would continue to reside in theircurrent locations.andP;  Since Oracle offers the capability to allow queries andupdates among multiple Oracle databases, the information could function asone large database.andP;  The original estimate was that we would have to spend$600,000 to $1 million on this.andP;  So  far, we have spent about  250,000,&quot;notes Kent.andM;With all the applications written on Oracle, the structure was standardizedto make it easier to synchronize the data.andP;  The data on Allen-Bradley'sdatabases is reconciled every night in batch mode.andP;  Until automatic,real-time updating of data on a network is fully available, that's the bestAllen-Bradley can do.andP;  Kent says when software can accommodate realtimeupdating, the company will use IBM's Logical Unit Type 6.2  (LU6.2) protocolto send transactions.andM;Eventually, Kent wants to provide his suppliers with access to the designdatabase so that they can turn around sample circuit boards faster.andP;  Today,Allen-Bradley uses electronic data interchange with vendors for ordertransactions, but Kent wants to go beyond that to exchanging design specs.andO;&quot;If I could send design specs electronically from our database, it would costless than the fast turnaround premium the supplier charges and speed up theprocess,&quot; says Kent.andP;  Real Time's the GoalandM;At Merrill Lynch's three money-market trading sites in Montreal, Toronto andVancouver, Canada, the firm wanted to make its trading inventory available toall brokers in real time to maximize its trading potential each day,according to Robert Jull, president of Linkage Inc., a Toronto-based localarea network software house that helped set up the Merrill Lynch application.andM;Merrill Lynch got around the problem of data replication by keeping a singledatabase that is updated in real time from all three remote sites.andP;  Whenreplication products become available, the brokerage house plans to break thedata down into databases at each of the three trading sites, says Jull.andM;The system uses workstations running os/2 with Presentation Manager on thetrading floor.andP;  The price per workstation is half of what it would have beenusing a proprietary minicomputer environment, says Jull.andP;  In addition, thesystem is well positioned to take advantage of further advances indistributed database management systems.andM;&quot;The trading floor at Merrill Lynch was manual, with inventory balancing donenightly by operator input,&quot; says Jull.andP;  &quot;Now, the trader uses the systemdirectly, so the second it is traded, it goes into inventory in the databasein Toronto and is available to other traders at all three sites.&quot;andM;Graphical user interfaces, a common concern for distributed databaseimplementation, were especially crucial at Merrill Lynch, says Jull.andP;  &quot;Thetrading floor is a busy environment and, for the trader to use the systemhimself, it has to be very easy and very fast.andM;Microsoft's SQL Server software handles queries over the LAN Manager networkbetween the workstations and the database.andP;  Everything is operational,&quot; saysJull.andP;  &quot;But there are still some performance problems for certain transactiontypes.&quot; Jull says the company is continuing to search for improvements and istesting Compaq SystemPROs and IBM Model 80s with small computer systeminterface (SCSI) drives for possible performance upgrades.andM;The Two Phases of CommitandM;As both Allen-Bradley and Merrill Lynch have discovered, real-time updatingof distributed databases is not here yet.andP;  Both await the implementation oftwo-phase commit, the method that allows data to be replicated or updated onmultiple databases across a network in real time.andM;Two-phase commit makes sure that the replication session is completed at eachnode on the network, without interruption before the updates are committed todatabase memory.andP;  This prevents the problem of half-completed or interruptedsessions on some nodes, which result in unsynchronized data.andP;  There is nostandard yet for implementation of two-phase commit, although theInternational Standards Organization (ISO) is considering two proposals.andM;&quot;Two-phase commit is the one key that is missing and is on the near horizonfor Oracle,&quot; says Kenneth Jacobs, Oracle's director of relational databasemanagement systems marketing.andP;  &quot;Two-phase commit will be a big milestone-thenpeople will really use distributed databases to partition data in differentlocations.&quot;andM;After two-phase commit establishes the first building block for real-timereplication of data, &quot;the next thing we'll see are procedures for doing thereplication itself, building on two-phase commit,&quot; predicts Jacobs.andP;  Thenwill come &quot;data-Case systems that include procedural extensions to SQL ...andO;and facilities for partitioning data onto different nodes.&quot; Ingres'distributed DBMS, Ingres/Star, has already begun to implement two-phasecommit for data replication and will be working on fleshing out its offeringsin this area.andP;  Microsoct's SQL Server also supports two-phase commit betweentwo SQL Servers, according to Walker.andP;  Microsoft is currently working onsupporting two-phase commit between SQL Server and DBMSS.andM;IBM, Ingres, Oracle and other major vendors already support access to theirown local and remote databases and have created gateways to other vendors'databases.andP;  But while these major vendors may all use SQL as their querylanguage, each vendor's implementation of SQL differs.andP;  &quot;The next keyproductivity gain will be to move more of the database management under astandardized SQL, so the user doesn't have to be concerned about the locationof the data,&quot; says George Zagelow, manager of architecture and standards atIBM's Santa Teresa Labs in San Jose.andP;  Zagelow oversees the SAA/SQL interfaceand IBM's participation in the SQL standards efforts.andM;The American National Standards Institute's SI) SQL standard has been widelyimplemented.andP;  But Ingres' Wasiolek says it is too broad.andP;  The next step,ANSI's SQL 11, is scheduled for ratification within the next year.andP;  &quot;It ismore narrow, but still not enough,&quot; says Wasiolek.andP;  One problem is that SQL11 does not specify anything object-oriented, and since object-orienteddatabases are one way to solve specific customer demands and differentiatevendors' products, it is very hard to avoid divergent implementation,Wasiolek notes.andM;Ingres has addressed the SQL problem by creating Open SQL, a language that itclaims makes use of the most common elements of SQL used by other databasevendors.andP;  Ingres uses a single interface for many different vendors'software.andP;  Oracle and others have taken the traditional approach of providinga different gateway into each vendor's environment.andM;The Big PictureandM;Oracle's Jacobs sees a number of other advances necessary to distributeddatabase implementation.andP;  &quot;You need to look at the entire networking market.andO;Networkwide security facilities to authenticate users across a network mustbe advanced.andP;  Naming services employed by the network operating systems andnetwork management must become more sophisticated.andP;  Standards must emerge forclient/server access.andP;  SQL must be standardized.andP;  It will not be easy toabsorb all this technology.andM;One of the obstacles to distributed databases is the difficulty of providingnetwork access to the data captive on older mainframe database environments.andO;According to Allen-Bradley's Kent, the distributed database tools today don'tadd up to a real distributed database standard.andP;  But he says even those toolsaren't fully used for one main reason.andP;  &quot;We all have the constraint of livingwith our existing systems.andP;  We can't start over, because we have too muchinvested in these mainframe databases-old system like ours under [IBM's] IMS.andO;We have to find an evolutionary way to get the data out of these systems.&quot;andM;Retiring Older DatabasesandM;Gateways from older database systems into the newer relational databasemanagement systems do exist, but they're not a complete answer, says Kent.andO;&quot;We are doing a lot of work in house between Oracle and IMS,&quot; he notes.andM;&quot;Gateways are an expensive proposition,&quot; agrees IBM's Zagelow,  especially ifyou try to gateway into a number of different environments.andP;  We are lookingto standards to solve this problem.andP;  The remote database access standardsbeing considered by ANSI and ISO would ensure that each database only needs aclient and a server to participate, at least starting with a standardizedSQL.andM;The complete, real-time distribution of databases and database managementsystems across local, wide area and global networks may not be commonplaceuntil about 2050, according to Zagelow.andP;  But the first products aimed at thatgoal are already available, and many network managers are putting togetherimplementation plans that will give them some form of distributed databasefunctions within the next two years.andM;&quot;Solutions will require innovation in a number of areas, and customers of IBMand DEC should make sure vendors are focusing on these things,&quot; says HarryPfendt, director of information technology services for corporate informationsystems at Rochester, N.Y.-based Eastman Kodak Corp. &quot;The 1990s are the timeto start attacking these problems.andP;  Open systems are coming, networks arematuring, we have new, sophisticated and powerful workstations.andP;  If we getsome breakthroughs in storage and some development in artificial intelligenceand expert systems in the 1990s, we can make significant progress towardcontrolling information.&quot;andM;Leila Davis L's a contributing editor for DATAMATION based in Alexandria, Va.andM;Where Vendors Are DistributedandM;To receive more information about distributed database management softwarefrom vendors discussed in this article, circle the appropriate number on thereader service card.andM;IBM Santa Teresa LaboratoryandM;San JoseandM;Circle No.andP;

 &quot;But first, we must come togrips with using the power of the computer to use and filter data.andP;  Usersdon't require more information,&quot; he says.andP;  They require more relevantinformation.&quot;andM;Kodak has no distributed database applications today, but believes thetechnology will play a key role in the future.andP;  The keys, says Pfendt, are&quot;how the applications are designed, how we use databases in clever ways tochange the way the company does business and to make it easier for Kodakcustomers to do business.andP;  &quot;andM;Pfendt sees mainframe storage technology as another impediment in moving dataoff of these older databases.andP;  &quot;Vendors are starting to address this problemof access to mainframe data from different environments-the need to connectthe IBM world with DEC and HP and ISO.andP;  But the data is on gigabytes of diskstorage, mostly on IBM mainframes, and that technology is still very muchsecond generation.andP;  You have to rely on the speed of the rotation of disks,which is not up to the speed advances of faster servers and fiber networks.andO;There is a generational hardware problem and the software that makes accessmore user friendly isn't there yet.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
