(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   There were technical disagreements but noacrimony during meetings of scientists that led to the decision toreduce power levels at the Savannah River Plant's nuclear reactors,plant officials said Monday.   The Washington Post reported Monday that the power levels werereduced by federal officials following a stormy meeting duringwhich scientists warned that the reactor was operating beyond thedemonstrated capacity of its emergency cooling system.   The Department of Energy officials initially were reluctant toorder the reduction because they didn't want to admit they had madea mistake and risk triggering public pressure to close the SouthCarolina facility, the newspaper reported, citing unidentifiedsources.   The decision was made during a meeting Feb. 12 to reduce powerlevels at two of the three government reactors at the SavannahRiver Plant _ the last Energy Department facility that producesplutonium, said Roger Rollins, the department's chief of reactorsat SRP.   Rollins described the 10 percent reduction in power _ the thirdreduction in 14 months _ as a routine action reflecting a change inthe way reactor temperatures are measured. The reduction droppedthe operating level from 1,100 megawatts thermal to 960 megawatts.Power had been reduced previously from 2,200 megawatts.   But the Post said its sources said the reduction was orderedonly at the insistence of scientists working for Du Pont, DOE'scontractor at Savannah River. The scientists had discovered afundamental error in the calculations that have been used fordecades to justify reactor operating levels, the newspaper said.   Savannah River manager Robert L. Morgan decided to reduce thelevels following a confrontation with the scientists at a Feb. 8meeting during which a top Du Pont scientist threw his securitybadge on the table in front of Morgan and threatened to ``gopublic'' unless the power levels were lowered, the sources said.   An unidentified DOE official told the Post that the departmentdid not want to ``raise the specter of continuing problems atSavannah River.''   Rollins denied Monday there was a fundamental error in the DOEcalculations and denied there were any heated disagreements duringeither of the meetings Feb. 8 and Feb. 12.   ``There were lots of technical discussion, which helped thedecision-making process,'' Rollins said. ``There was no dissention.Utilmately, everyone agreed with the decision to make the minoradjustment.''</TEXT></DOC>
