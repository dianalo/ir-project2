The newest well-logging apparatus (FMS: FormationMicroscanner) by Schlumberge Co. has a variety of image processing functions.Petrological properties, porosities, oil saturation can be obtained byusing changes in the electroresistance of formations. The structure ofdeposits, and geological bindings and faults can be revealed by usingcalculation results with a diameter (SHDT; Stratigraphic High ResolutionDipmeter Tool). Information on the percentage of clay minerals, grainsize, and fractures can be obtained by electroconductivity curve analysis.Also, information by the vertical change in the thickness of a bed, andthe secondary geological structure information can be obtained. The sandstonereservoir in Pamaguan field in Indonesia was analyzed. Available informationand well-logging data were edited and corrected to give a vertical petrologicalphase, which was compared with the well-logging data. On the other hand,the data with SHDT were processed to give a deposits structure information.A deposits model was given by comparison with the investigation resultson Modern Mahakam Delta. As a result of the analysis, channel sandstoneswere estimated. One of the eleven channel sandstone layers was oil depositshaving an anticline structure. (17 figs, 7 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
