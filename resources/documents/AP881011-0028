The United Paperworkers International Union abruptly announcedan end to strikes at International Paper mills in Maine, Wisconsinand Pennsylvania, saying the move would give the 2,300 strikers thefirst shot at any jobs vacated by the non-union workers running themills.   ``This stage of the war is over,'' said Felix Jacques, executivevice president of Local 14. ``We have lost this battle but the warfor justice in the workplace is not over.''   The workers, including 1,200 at the Jay plant, went on strikeJune 16, 1987, when the union rejected a concessionary contract.The company imposed the contract and kept the plants open withreplacement workers.   The key unresolved issues included the company's demand to enddouble time for employees who worked Sundays and holidays, and toeliminate more than 175 jobs by changing work rules.   William Meserve, the local's president, said the strikes werehalted because the company was willing to spend ``hundreds ofmillions of dollars to try to break the unions or make themineffective.''   Jacques said the national union could not provide the supportneeded to continue the strike much longer. The $55 weekly paymentsto the strikers were scheduled to be suspended in six weeks, hesaid.   ``It's not that we don't want to fight _ it's just that wecan't,'' said striker Roland Samson. ``We have nothing to fightwith.''   Jacques notified his grim-faced members at a news conferenceMonday, one day after presidents of UPIU locals at the three millshad reached their decision at union headquarters in Nashville,Tenn. The 1,200 union members in Jay comprised the largest group ofstrikers.   A mill spokesman here acknowledged that by calling off thestrike, the union members gained the right to be given preferencefor any openings. But he said the mill was ``at full complement''and hires new employees at an average of only three per week.   ``As openings occur, we will welcome workers who have been onstrike who qualify for those openings,'' said the spokesman,Richard White. He emphasized that no replacements would be asked toleave.   International Paper, one of the world's largest paper companies,has said the strike had little effect on production. Shareholders'net earnings during the first half of 1988 were $347 million,compared with $180 million for the period last year, White said.Net sales rose from $3.7 billion for the period last year to $4.7billion this year.   Strikes also were halted at International Paper mills in DePere, Wis., and Lock Haven, Pa. The action had no direct impact onthe Mobile, Ala., mill, where the company has locked out more than1,000 union members.   The union had sought to consolidate the disputes at the fourmills, but with little success.   During the strike, this mill in this central Maine town of 4,000had been the scene of boisterous rallies, marches, and occasionalviolence and vandalism that led to court orders limiting activitieson the picket line.   A series of chemical leaks and accidents at the mill heightenedtensions in recent months, with the union blaming the problems onthe new workers' inexperience.</TEXT></DOC>
