In constructing the model, existing models were used as muchas possible and linked in a single framework. Scientists from many countrieshave served in the model's review process. RAINS emphasizes the transboundaryaspect of air pollution. Hence, spatially it covers all of Europe includingthe European part of the USSR, with a time horizon from 1960 to 2040.The model is currently sulfur-based because of the principal role ofsulfur dioxide as a precursor of acid deposition. However, the modelis being expanded to include emissions of nitrogen oxides and ammonia.RAINS consists of three linked compartments: pollutant generation, atmosphericprocesses, and environmental impacts. Sections are devoted to soil acidificationlake acidification, other impact submodels, uncertainty analysis, andpolicy using science. 6 figures, 1 table.</TEXT></DOC>
