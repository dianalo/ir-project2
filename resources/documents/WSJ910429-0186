Shell's main weakness was in gasoline refining andmarketing, where it posted an operating loss. The companycontinues to be hurt by the effects of a 1988 explosion thatkilled seven men and devastated its Norco, La., refinery. Bycomparison, Mobil Corp.'s U.S. refining profit more thandoubled last quarter, and Amoco Corp.'s surged 66%.</LP><TEXT>   Shell said net income dropped to $125 million from $203million a year earlier, while revenue slipped 1.5% to $5.67billion from $5.75 billion. Shell doesn't report per-shareearnings because it is a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group,with dual headquarters in London and the Hague.   The parent company, in fact, is expected in several weeksto announce a substantial earnings increase like thosereported by other international oil companies. &quot;When thegroup reports its earnings, they're going to be astoundinglygood,&quot; said Bernard Picchi, international oil analyst atSalomon Brothers Inc. in New York.   The Shell Oil unit's underperformance, however, is causingconcern. &quot;We are obviously not satisfied with the level ofearnings from our petroleum operations and are developingoptions designed to bring our performance more in line withour corporate financial objectives,&quot; Frank Richardson,Shell's president, said in a statement.   A Shell spokesman acknowledged that the earnings declinereflects difficulties at the company, but he wouldn't be morespecific about the remedies being considered. &quot;Nobody at thispoint is comfortable discussing those because they're stillbeing developed,&quot; he said.   The company said it earned $4 million in the refiningsector. But without the benefit of a $20 million gain, Shellwould have recorded a loss of $16 million. That's a slightimprovement from last year's $21 million loss.   While other U.S. oil companies were enjoying wide profitmargins from the refining of oil into gasoline last quarter,Shell had to buy costly gasoline from other refiners becauseof the Norco refinery accident, industry analysts said. Atthe same time, price wars at the pump in much of the U.S.reduced retail profit margins, and Shell couldn't make up thedifference. Shell also said results were hurt by increasedrefinery maintenance and higher environmental costs.   Shell's exploration and production earnings were alsoweaker than those of its competitors. Most posted declines inprofits because oil prices were slightly lower and naturalgas prices were sharply lower. But Shell's profit decline of48% to $90 million was worse than other companies'.</TEXT></DOC>
