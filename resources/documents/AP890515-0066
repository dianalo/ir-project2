Bush's crime-fighting package, which he was to announce in aspeech on the Capitol steps today, is focused on tougher treatmentof criminals through increased enforcement efforts and stiffersentences.   He also has decided to make permanent a temporary suspension heimposed in March that stopped semiautomatic assault-style riflesfrom coming into the country, officials said in advance of theaddress.   The weapons banned will be those that have come to be used forcriminal rather than sporting purposes as determined by an ongoingreview by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, said anagency official who declined to be identified.   Current law provides that only sporting weapons can be imported,but the standards now will be tightened and enforced to excludethat many previously allowed in will be excluded, the official said.   Other administration sources have said Bush is calling for adeath penalty for drug ``kingpins,'' a position he advocated in hiselection campaign last year, and for those who commit terroristacts against Americans abroad.   Bush also is seeking $1 billion from Congress for prisonconstruction and enlargement _ enough to provide capacity for up to29,000 new prisoners, deputy White House chief of staff Andrew CardJr. said Sunday.   The $1 billion would be spent over the next four years.   Officials said Bush also is asking for more money for lawenforcement officers and prosecutors and will advocate stiffenedpenalties for those who use guns. Use of assault-style weaponswould bring even harsher sentences.   Included in the plan is money for 375 additional ATF agents, 300FBI agents and 150 deputy U.S. marshals.   But the most intense attention has focused on whether thepresident would extend the suspension of imports of thesemiautomatic rifles. The guns are a favorite of street criminals,becoming more prevalent especially in drug-related crimes, but somemodels are used by hunters as well, according to gun owners.   Card said that while the president was still reviewing the finalpackage, his speech at today's ceremony honoring slain policeofficers would state an intention to make that import ban permanent.   Card said the president would advocate a ``hard look'' atrestricting domestically produced weapons, many of which arevirtually identical to the banned imports. But the presidentapparently decided not to ban sales in the domestic market at thispoint.   Bush on March 14 imposed a temporary ban on importedassault-style weapons _ including Soviet-developed AK-47s andIsraeli-made Uzis.   He launched a survey by the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco andFirearms to review whether any of these weapons are imported forsporting purposes. Under current law, that is the only permissiblereason for which they can enter the country. The review is to becompleted in about mid-June.   Card told reporters in Lexington, Ky., as Bush prepared toreturn to the capital after a three-day swing through Texas andMississippi, that the review would determine which of the modelswould be permanently barred.   ``We'll see what definitions these weapons fall under,'' saidCard.   The definition issue promises to be a sticky one, especiallysince many of the imports have the same characteristics asdomestically produced rifles.   During his 1988 presidential campaign, Bush called forconverting unneeded military bases into state and federal prisons,and for using money seized from drug dealers to help pay foradditional prison space _ proposals also expected to be reflectedin the new package.   ``The crime problem is not easily solved by one bill alone,''Card said. ``We'll also be looking for the states to do somethings. This is not the do-all and end-all. This is just asignificant beginning.''   Bush returned to Washington on Sunday morning after attendingchurch in Versailles, Ky. He spoke at graduations Friday andSaturday in Texas and Mississippi.   In Kentucky, he spoke at a $1.3 million dinner Saturday nightfor GOP Sen. Mitch McConnell's 1990 re-election.   Bush also during the trip issued a call to the people andnational defense forces of Panama to rise up and oust thatcountry's ruler, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.   Bush stopped short of specifically calling for a coup, but saidthe Panamanians should get Noriega out.   The Bush administration has denounced Noriega for rigging lastSunday's election, and when Noriega nullified it accused him ofthrowing away the results because his candidate lost despite thefraud.</TEXT></DOC>
