<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-89-0679 </DOCNO><TEXT>A computational characteristic property of real-time power system emergencycontrol is discussed, which is based on the decomposition techniquesand modified second-order methods for optimal load-flow with securityconstraints. The algorithm is developed for the solution of large-scaleproblems. Numerical results of test cases including a 980 bus systemare given. Ways of solving the problem are considered, in cases whenthe initial estimate for the calculation of post-fault equilibrium state(PFS) does not exist. The algorithm makes it possible to determine thebuses, where the active power variation has the greatest effect on thevalue of characteristic determinant for the ultimate operating conditions.</TEXT></DOC>
