The reason: BCCI.   North of here, where plantations stretch to the horizon,no one is working because the local palm-oil refinery is outof commission. The refinery, Socapalm, is waiting for $2million in spare parts that will never arrive. It banked withBCCI, the Bank of Credit and Commmerce International.</LP><TEXT>   On a site surrounded by the malarial swamps of this portcity, physician Omer Nguewa and a handful of investors havecreated Africa's first private pharmaceutical company. ButDr. Nguewa points to an empty warehouse where a tablet-makingoperation was to be installed. His financing has vanishedbecause of BCCI.   The only ship in Douala's port -- the sole gateway forthis and three other countries -- is a rusting freighter thatlooks as if it last moved to make way for the African Queen.The port is now open only two days a week, Saturday andSunday. Shipping executive Richard Massot waits at a BCCIbranch to withdraw 10% of a deposit, the maximum now allowed.&quot;Our account is blocked, which means we can't pay people,&quot; hesays. &quot;Our customers' money is blocked, which means theycan't pay us.&quot;   The crisis reaches all the way up the ladder in Cameroon,to the gargantuan presidential palace in Yaounde, thecapital. The finance ministry says more than a third ofCameroon's government reserves were deposited at BCCI;diplomats and bankers say nearly a month of governmentsalaries may be lost.   The collapse of BCCI is becoming Africa's problem. Thebank served 17 or 18 countries on this continent. In manyAfrican nations it was part of the establishment, a banker toentrepreneurs, governments and business.   Now, although BCCI in Cameroon isn't closed, economicconfidence is shaken, and many businesses are paralyzed.Exports and imports are falling because of unpaidforeign-exchange contracts and frozen letters of credit.Government reserves are stuck in BCCI. Workers and civilservants may not get paid. International aid and humanitarianprograms, ranging from the United Nations' to the U.S.government's, are delayed because assets are blocked in BCCI.   The financial repercussions are particularly acute here.After BCCI itself, the government was the biggest equityshareholder in the bank's Cameroon unit, with a 35% equitystake. With BCCI here severed from seized branches in othernations, that stake isn't worth much.   BCCI's collapse &quot;is a severe hit to the economy and forgovernment finances,&quot; says Ephraim Inoni, Cameroon'ssecretary of state for finance. &quot;In addition to the materialloss, the effect on the confidence of our people isenormous.&quot;   Bankers and aid officials say the situation is similarfrom Botswana to Niger. BCCI got about 11% of its more than$20 billion in deposits from Africa, funds drawn in as partof what regulators call one of the most complex financialfrauds in history. Now, much of Africa's money is frozen --much of that perhaps gone forever.   &quot;There is no money,&quot; says Ick Nigckou, a roadside peddlerfrom neighboring Nigeria who sells French bread andhardboiled eggs from a basket perched precariously on hishead. &quot;People don't even buy food.&quot;   Sub-Saharan Africa is in abject poverty because ofoverpopulation, a lack of resources in some countries, andmismanagement and corruption in others. Even before thecollapse of BCCI, the region was sliding backwardeconomically. Its gross domestic product (excluding SouthAfrica's) has shrunk by about 10% over the past five years.The average rural African today has a lower living standardthan in 1970, and will be poorer at the end of the decadethan at decolonization in 1960. &quot;No one thought the economicsituation could get even this bad,&quot; says a European diplomat.&quot;Now it's getting worse. The BCCI affair won't help.&quot;   Cameroon was a relative success story a decade ago whenoil was booming. But with dwindling income from naturalresources and steadily rising costs, the country has been indeficit and in recession for five years. The economic malaiseis undermining political stability. Cameroon is about toenter the third month of a general strike to oppose therepressive government of longtime president Paul Biya.   On Sunday, a big opposition protest was broken up bypolice firing tear gas from helicopters. Hundreds werearrested for calling for a national political conference,opposition leaders say. On most days in Douala, groups ofyouths in dirty T-shirts and sandals loiter all day in frontof closed shops and restaurants. There is little to do, andno money to do it with.   Cameroon's economic difficulties and the BCCI problem areintertwined. The bank's assets represented about 2% of grossdomestic product.   In a part of the world in which economic statistics areunreliable, no one can measure precisely the impact of BCCI'scollapse. But diplomats, bankers and industrialists are sureit will be severe. &quot;The position was desperate even beforethis,&quot; says one Western diplomat. &quot;This makes it worse.&quot;   Africa's economic prospects looked much brighter when BCCIarrived in the late 1970s. West Africa in particular wasdeveloping oil, and the bank quickly arrangedforeign-exchange and trading business on the strength of cozyrelations it fostered with the region's strongmen andmilitary rulers.   BCCI worked its same brand of financial alchemy here as inthe rest of the world. It offered speedy transactions,especially foreign exchange, with little paper work. It hiredinfluential local leaders to open doors and provide politicalprotection. It offered attractive returns and uncommonefficiency. Though repatriating funds from many West Africancountries, especially Nigeria, can take months, BCCI did itin days. It offered account statements weekly, whencompetitors never provided them. In short order, the bankwove itself into the local economy.   In Cameroon, BCCI's general manager is Enow Tanjong, atwo-time former state governor and longtime confidant ofCameroon leaders. Its chairman, Kanga Zamb, is former head ofcustoms and inspector general of the finance ministry. InZambia, a former foreign minister, Vernon Mwaanga, is BCCI'sZambian chairman. And BCCI's policy of employing children ofinfluential businessmen gave the bank ties to companiesaccounting for as much as 80% of Cameroon's exports, bankerssay.   In an interview, Mr. Tanjong says &quot;there was noillegality&quot; at the bank's operations in Cameroon. He sayshiring influential government officials &quot;isn't a question ofgetting access -- it's that the government has confidence inpeople they know.&quot; He also says that the Cameroon bank isseeking to split itself from BCCI Holdings, the Luxembourgparent shut down by global regulators, by selling theparent's 65% stake to local investors. &quot;We would be muchsmaller but could operate on our own,&quot; he says.   BCCI's close government ties help explain why it has beenable to stay open in most African countries while governmentselsewhere have been shutting it down. &quot;We did our foreigntransfers through BCCI, and we have found no evidence ofwrongdoing,&quot; says Mr. Inoni, the Cameroon finance official.He acknowledges that government ministers had personalaccounts with the bank but says there is no evidence offraud. Cameroon isn't in any hurry to find out more. Aninvestigator looking at BCCI here might not report until nextmonth or later.   There are plenty of stories of corruption. African bankersflying into Ghana's Accra airport, for example, still tell ofhow BCCI paid for the radar-landing system there: Thepurchase was financed at five percentage points above thecost of funds, allegedly split 60-40 between BCCI and membersof the Ghanaian government. In Kenya, BCCI officials wereimplicated in a 1987 foreign-exchange scandal. Threeofficials were arrested and the bank eventually paid a $30million fine, according to other bankers.   And though Western investigators haven't yet focused onthis, former French colonies in West Africa provide some ofthe world's least-regulated access to hard currency. Onequestion that arises is why BCCI stayed open here while manyforeign banks, including Bank of America and Chase Manhattan,pulled out amid economic decline. BCCI's little-scrutinizedAfrican operations would have been invaluable to amoney-laundering operation.   More than a dozen countries here use a hard currency thatis freely convertible at fixed rates into the French franc,and whose integrity is backed by the French government. Whilein theory there are local exchange laws, business istransacted with none of the scrutiny the French exercise inParis. &quot;No doubt it is easier to get foreign-exchange herethan in other parts of the world,&quot; says a local official ofSCB-Credit Lyonnais, the Cameroon affiliate of the Frenchbank. BCCI's Mr. Tanjong says there was no misconduct at thebank: &quot;I don't think there has been any contact&quot; with drugsor any money laundering activities.   While there are angry protests some places in the ThirdWorld, alleging a Western conspiracy against BCCI, therearen't any demonstrators on the steps of BCCI's Doualabranch, just disappointed customers like Mr. Massot wonderingwhat to do now. &quot;The bank seemed to be working pretty well.We don't understand how these problems in the West are ourproblem,&quot; he says.   And many here seem indifferent to corruption allegations.BCCI worked well in a region where things seldom do. Itprovided needed foreign exchange and trade financing, thesort of First World services Africa often lacks.   Indeed, BCCI's profile was sufficiently blue-chip to lureUncle Sam as a major client. The U.S. government was one ofBCCI's biggest customers in Cameroon, with $10 million inU.S. Agency for International Development accounts. That isequal to about 5% of BCCI Cameroon's published assets.   The BCCI affair has frozen 90% of the U.S. deposits, theeffect of which is to slow aid and assistance programs,including immunization and nutrition programs for children inthe countryside.   With Cameroon's government concerned about a wideningbanking crisis here, the U.S. doesn't seem likely to get allits money out soon. &quot;It's a problem,&quot; says EllsworthAmundson, AID's associate director here. &quot;It's aninconvenience. But I believe we can work around it.&quot;   Back at his pharmaceutical laboratory, Dr. Nguewa talksabout all the problems that African business can't workaround. He says BCCI's collapse has made access to financingstill more difficult for Africa's economy. With his threeappointment books and 40-megabyte laptop computer, Dr. Nguewais a new sort of African businessman. &quot;A French colleagueonce told me, `You are an African who is lost in Africa.' Itold him, `No, I am an African who sees a better Africa.'&quot;   He adds: &quot;Every problem in Africa is urgent: health,roads, industry. The last thing we needed was something likethis.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
