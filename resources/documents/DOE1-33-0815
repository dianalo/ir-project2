Guidedby model compound studies, they reached the following conclusions regardingcollagen side chain dynamics from their analysis of line shapes and relaxationrates. At 22{sup 0}C, imino residues in all samples have flexible ringswith root mean square angular fluctuations in the 11-30{sup 0} range.Nearly all labeled amino acid side chains reorient about at least twoside chain single bonds. At temperatures below -30{sup 0}C, most of theseside chain motions are absent in all the samples. Surprisingly, in contrastwith results obtained for backbone motions, side chain motions are onlymarginally more hindered in mineralized samples as compared with nonmineralizedsamples, a result they discuss with reference to collagen-mineral interactions.They also discuss the possible relationship between collagen dynamicsand function.</TEXT></DOC>
