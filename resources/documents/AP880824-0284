U.S. banks hold about $20 billion of Brazil's debt, which is thebiggest in the Third World. The U.S. government holds the biggestblock of shares in the international fund, to which Brazil alreadyowes $3.08 billion. The fund is owned by 151 countries.   The government of Brazilian President Jose Sarney, hard hit byinflation, may draw installments of the fund's ``standbyarrangement'' _ as the new loan is called _ through Feb. 28, 1990.Under the fund's usual practice, reviews are held after eachinstallment to decide if the borrower has been performing as agreedand whether the next installment can be drawn.   The fund's credits go along with $5.2 billion being offered toBrazil by banks worldwide to which it already owes about $68billion. Brazil has 700 creditor banks, which have pledged 95percent of the additional loans promised. Disbursal of such loansis often withheld if the fund's disbursements are stopped.   Interest on old debt already costs Brazil $10.2 billion to $10.4billion a year. Much of the interest owed to banks was not paidlast year, but some payments have now resumed. The principal hasnot been reduced in recent years, as is generally the case withThird World debt, which is expected to reach a total of more than$1.2 trillion by the end of the year.   The fund said Brazil has pledged to cut the government's deficitin 1988 to 4 percent of the country's gross national product and tocut it again in 1989. The deficit amounted to 5.5 percent of GNP in1987. The World Bank calculates that Brazil's total production in1986 was worth about $250 billion, or $1,810 for each citizen.   Brazil is promising to cut inflation, according to the fund'sannouncement. Figures from Brazil say inflation reached a record24.04 percent for the month of July and may run close to 1,000percent for the year. By the fund's calculations, consumer priceshave been rising at an annual rate of about 500 percent in thefirst four months of the year.   The Brazilian government's program, as outlined by the fund,aims to shrink differences of income among its people, to increasesavings, improve the country's surplus in world trade, reducebarriers to imports, increase efficiency, reduce governmentregulation, privatize state-owned industry and reform the financialsystem.   ``These reforms are expected to ... contribute to foster overalleconomic growth,'' the fund said.   Despite its economic problems Brazil already has one of the bestrecords for growth in the Western Hemisphere: 4.3 percent annuallyfor each citizen over the years 1965 to 1986, according to theWorld Bank. Growth in the United States as only 1.6 percent overthe same period, but Americans earn almost $10 for every dollar theaverage Brazilian makes.</TEXT></DOC>
