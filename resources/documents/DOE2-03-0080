<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-03-0080 </DOCNO><TEXT>A beamport is currently being instrumented to utilize high energy synchrotronradiation from the superconducting wiggler magnet on the X-ray ring atthe National Synchrotron Light Source. Two independent programs are beingdeveloped to run in tandem, nonconcurrently, on the central beamline:Material sciences on X17B1 and medical research/angiography on X17B2.A high pressure research program will run independently on a side station.X17C. Considerations in the design of the beamline include handling severepower loading, radiation shielding protection and beam energy filtering.</TEXT></DOC>
