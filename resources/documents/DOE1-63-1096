This utilityand Gilbert/Commonwealth conducted an evaluation and prepared a conceptualdesign of a grass roots, nominal 500 MW CGCC power plant which couldbe put into commercial operation by 1995. A summary of the plant's design,a discussion on the development of the plant's configuration, and a sectionconcerning capital and operating costs are included in this presentation.The results of this study will be used along with results from studiesaddressing competing technologies to assist in the development of thefuture power mix for this utility's electric system.</TEXT></DOC>
