The increase reported by the Commerce Department in the broadestmeasure of economic health was up from an advance estimate of 2.5percent issued last month.   The revision was about in line with economists' expectations,but it could still cause the Federal Reserve Board to move morecautiously in its campaign to lower interest rates as a stimulantto growth.   Most of the revision was attributed to a better-than-anticipatedtrade performance. The September trade deficit, which hit afive-year low, was unavailable when the advance estimate was made.   Exports climbed at an annual rate of 1.6 percent in the thirdquarter, compared with an earlier estimate of no change, whileimports grew only 9.5 percent, compared with a 15.1 percent jump inlast month's report.   Consumer spending was also better than first thought, rising abrisk annual rate of 6.2 percent _ the strongest since the firstquarter of 1988 _ compared with a preliminary estimate of 5.8percent.   Inflation, as measured by a price index tied to the GNP,improved dramatically in the third quarter, climbing at an annualrate of 2.9 percent after a 5.0 percent jump in the April-Junequarter. Those figures were unchanged from the advance estimate.   The GNP grew at an annual rate of 2.5 percent in the secondquarter and for the first nine months of the year is averaging a3.0 percent annual rate, just above the Bush administration'sforecast for the whole year.   At the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwatersaid, ``We always like to see increase in growth. And this reportis relatively good news in that sense.''   Still, many analysts believe the economy will have a tough timemeeting the target because of a dramatic slowing in the currentthree-month period. A few predict the country will topple into arecession, ending the seven-year economic expansion that isunprecedented in peacetime.   It would take only a 1.8 percent GNP increase in theOctober-December quarter to match the administration forecast,according to a Commerce Department analyst, but most privateeconomists expect a growth rate of 1.5 percent or lower.   ``My view is we can stay out of a recession, but just barely,''said economist David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston andamp; Co., a governmentsecurities dealer in New York.   In a separate report today, the Commerce Department saidafter-tax corporate profits were off a sharp 7.2 percent in thethird quarter, matching the decline in the second quarter, whichwas the worst performance in three years. The decline marks thethird consecutive quarter that profits have dropped.   But, the department attributed $11 billion of the $15.5 billiondecline to losses from Hurricane Hugo. Benefits paid by insurancecompanies totaled $9 billion, while uninsured corporate lossestotaled $2 billion.   Jones said corporate profits will continue to be weak. With theeconomy softening, companies are finding it difficult to pass onrising labor costs to their customers, he said.   Analysts generally do not expect the third-quarter surge inconsumer spending will be repeated, attributing much of it to autopurchases spurred by dealer discounts and financing incentives.   They also are pessimistic about trade, believing that thestrength in the dollar will stall improvement in the deficit.   However, Michael Boskin, the president's chief economic adviser,said Tuesday that falling interest rates should sustain economicgrowth into next year.   ``Some private forecasters believe the economy will slow. ...But even the most pessimistic forecaster does not see a seriousdownturn in the economy,'' Boskin told a conference sponsored bythe Agriculture Department.   The Federal Reserve in June reversed its program of fightinginflation with rising interest rates, but has lowered rates onlygradually since then. It last eased credit early this month,nudging the rate charged among banks for overnight loans down aquarter-point to 8.5 percent.   Many analysts incorrectly reported last week that the Fed hadeased again, but they still expect the move to come before the endof the year.   In other details from today's GNP report:   _Business capital spending, a bright spot in previous quarters,slowed to an annual growth rate of 4.6 percent, compared with theadvance estimate of 5.8 percent. Analysts say falling corporateprofits will cause businesses to further cut back in this area.   _Housing construction, which has been in a slump as a result ofthe Fed's inflation-fighting campaign, fell at an annual rate of8.4 percent, nearly double the advance estimate of a 4.8 percentdecline.   The various changes left the economy, after adjusting forinflation, growing at an annual rate of $4.16 trillion in the thirdquarter, $27.7 billion higher than the second-quarter pace.</TEXT></DOC>
