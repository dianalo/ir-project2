For more than six months, finding the computer snoop was a lonelyobsession for 38-year-old Clifford Stoll, who initially was unableto convince the FBI to investigate the computer break-in.   On Thursday, a West German official announced the arrests ofthree hackers who allegedly acquired sensitive military computerpasswords and codes and sold them to the Soviets. The Pentagon hasnot determined the extent of the damage to U.S. security.   A West German television network said the passwords and otherinformation came from key military and research computers in theUnited States, Western Europe and Japan.   ``I would say (Stoll) was largely responsible for cracking thecase,'' said Charles S. Hurley, former spokesman for the LawrenceBerkeley Laboratory in Berkeley, Calif., where Stoll once worked.``Over a period of many months, he tracked them.''   It all started with a 75-cent accounting error that Stoll noticedin the California laboratory's shared-time computer system accountsin August 1986.   ``If it had been $1,000 off, I wouldn't have thought anything ofit,'' Stoll said in an interview Thursday. ``It's like, if yourhouse collapses, you just assume there's been an earthquake. But ifyou find a tiny termite hole, you think, `Geez, I'd betterinvestigate.' It's the little problems that are the mostfascinating.''   Stoll, a computer expert with a doctorate in astronomy from theUniversity of Arizona, searched for clues for three days anddiscovered the error was caused by someone who had gained access tothe computer through telephone lines.   ``For four months, I did absolutely nothing but watch what hetyped in,'' said the bushy-haired Stoll.   Stoll said it became apparent that the hacker was trying to usethe Berkeley Laboratory's computer as a gateway to the so-calledMilnet, a computer network linking defense plants, university labsand military installations.   ``He was searching for key words like nuclear, ICBM, SDI,biological warfare, Norad. He was reading everything he could gethis hands on, and then it turns out he was selling it to theSoviets,'' Stoll said.   He said he told the FBI about the hacker in the late summer of1986, but there wasn't much of a response.   ``They said, `What have you lost?' I said, `Well, all we'veactually lost is 75 cents.' So the FBI said, `Who cares, it's notimportant.'''   To be fair, Stoll added, ``They're much more sensitive tocomputer break-ins now.''   Charles Steinmetz, a spokesman for the FBI in Washington, saidthe bureau would not comment on the case.   Stoll said his girlfriend, tired of his electronic pager thatwould beep whenever the hacker got onto the system, was responsiblefor the big break in the case. She suggested that he lay a trap.   He created bogus military data and a fictitious computer networkcalled ``SDI Net.'' The hacker took the bait, spending two hoursreading through the material, giving Stoll enough time to trace thecall to Hanover, West Germany.   Three months later, Stoll said, he got a letter from a man inPittsburgh asking for information about SDI Net. When he turned thatletter over to the FBI in April 1987, he said, the bureau found theman had connections to Eastern European governments and immediatelybegan an investigation.   In all, Stoll said the spy ring had attempted to break into about450 different computers and succeeded in stealing information frommore than 40 of them _ including data systems at the Pentagon,defense contracting firms and U.S. military bases around the world.   According to a German television network, authorities believe theWest German hackers were recruited by the Soviet KGB in 1985 and``were paid with cash and drugs ... and were later forced to providethe codes and passwords to the Soviets.''   Stoll now has a contract from Doubleday Inc. to write a bookabout his not-so-amateur sleuthing.   But he said he is glad the case is nearing an end so he can getback to work at the Harvard-Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory inCambridge, Mass.   ``In one sense, it was exciting,'' he said. ``In another sense,it was dreadful, because I got zero astronomy done for two years.''</TEXT></DOC>
