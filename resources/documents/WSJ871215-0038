After trading closed, it was reported from Vienna that OPEC members agreed to extend the current pact, with its official $18 a barrel price. Traders and analysts were skeptical that the action would stem the price weakness.    &quot;Given the current excessive overproduction, prices will continue to skid and may even drop as low as $16.50 a barrel if OPEC can't come up with something that will keep output in line with quotas,&quot; said Eric T. Bolling, vice president of Geldermann Inc.    Nauman Barakat, analyst for Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co., said, &quot;I think we will see substantially lower prices in weeks to come and they may drop as low as the $16 seen earlier in the year.&quot;    January-delivery crude-oil prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange closed 87 cents a barrel lower at $17.44. January heating oil fell 1.57 cents a gallon to 53.36 cents, while January-delivery gasoline fell 1.74 cents a gallon to 45.05 cents.    At the start of trading, crude-oil prices fell almost the daily limit of $1 a barrel in effect for all trading months except January. The market took its cue from drops of more than $1 in the European and American cash markets, Mr. Bolling said, and continued to trade nervously and under pressure throughout the day.    Iran and Iraq dissension had been the major stumbling block to achieving an accord since the talks began last Wednesday, analysts agreed. Iran objected to overproduction by OPEC members. It wanted Iraq, which has a quota but isn't obeying it, to adhere to production controls and for OPEC to increase its price to $20 a barrel from $18. Iraq wanted its quota of 1.5 million barrels a day raised to Iran's 2.4 million barrels.    According to the OPEC announcement, Iraq will be left out of the agreement and its 1.5 million barrel quota will be deducted from OPEC's overall 16.6 million barrel-a-day output limit, leaving the overall quota at 15.1 million barrels.    Mr. Barakat said OPEC is deducting Iraq's quota to fashion what the group felt would be a &quot;psychologically lower-seeming quota.&quot; He called the move &quot;an illusion created with smoke and mirrors. But I don't think anyone will fall for it.&quot;    Analysts estimate Iraq has been producing as much as 2.8 million barrels a day and that OPEC members collectively have been producing more than 18 million barrels daily. As a result, prices have dipped close to $17 a barrel, an eight-month low.    Robert Baker, senior energy analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities, said, &quot;Prices can be sustained and even go up if there are creditable statements from such key overproducers as Kuwait and the United Arab Emerates that they will adhere to the agreement.&quot; However, he said, in the absence of such assurances, the agreement will lose its validity and prices probably would weaken.    Yesterday's price drop in fact may prove a positive factor, said Peter Beutel, assistant director Elders Futures Inc., an energy group. &quot;The price plunge may jolt OPEC members into the reality of what their overproduction and inability to agree on supportive measures has caused and it may help bring them together to fashion some sort of pact,&quot; he said.    In other commodity markets yesterday:    LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: Cattle-futures prices soared as snowstorms struck parts of Texas and New Mexico. Feedlot conditions are &quot;kind of a mess,&quot; said Howard Diedrichsen, manager of Dumas Cattle Feeders, a Dumas, Texas, feedlot. He said snow and cold would knock weight off of healthy animals, and lessen the chance of survival for those that are ill. &quot;If they've got pneumonia or anything they probably aren't going to make it,&quot; he said. &quot;The wind force is enough that (healthy) cattle have bunched up in pens and aren't eating properly.&quot; The extent of the weight losses would depend on how long inclement conditions persist, he said. News of the storms sparked a sharp rally in cattle markets. The live-cattle contract for December settlement at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange closed at 65.42 cents a pound, up 1.35 cents, after reaching the permissible daily limit of 1.5 cents. Hog futures rose as the storm front moved east threatening hog operations in parts of Iowa, Illinois and Missouri.    PRECIOUS METALS: Prices of gold futures declined despite weakness in the dollar. December-delivery gold settled at $495.50 per ounce for a loss of $1.60, after trading above $500 early in the session. Bernard Savaiko, senior precious-metals analyst at PaineWebber Inc., said there was little speculative participation. &quot;It was mostly a professional affair,&quot; he said. Dealers in Europe went bargain-hunting with gold at under $500. This helped New York open higher and the Europeans then sold New York futures, according to Mr. Savaiko. Weakness in the oil market was also a factor, he said. &quot;Many may have remembered that, back in February 1983, when gold was above $500, selling was triggered -- causing a gold-price collapse -- by a decline in oil prices,&quot; the analyst said. December silver rose 7.3 cents an ounce to $6.978 and January-delivery platinum fell $3.60 an ounce to $507.    COPPER: Futures prices ended mixed as late selling erased most strong early gains. The December contract rose 0.85 cents a pound to $1.29, and January-delivery copper advanced 1.8 cents to $1.24, but other months fell as much as 3.5 cents, with weakness notable in most deferred positions. One trade source said there was nothing to account for the weakness. &quot;The market was trading at three cents or more higher during the whole day, when a spurt of selling came in at the close that sent prices tumbling. Then the market closed before an offsetting buying reaction could begin,&quot; he said. Supplies continued to decline, with drops reported in warehouse stocks of the London Metal Exchange and the New York Commodity Exchange. </TEXT></DOC>
