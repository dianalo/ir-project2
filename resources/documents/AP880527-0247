Refugee Office</HEAD><DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Vietnamese officials and the the U.N. refugeeagency began their annual meeting Friday, months earlier than usualfollowing a sharp increase in the number of ``boat people'' fleeingIndochina.   According to the agency, 10,628 boat people were registered inthe region in the first four months of this year and the May figureis expected to top 4,000.   Among topics to be discussed with a four-member Vietnamesedelegation led by vice foreign minister Ha Van Lau, who also isambassador to France, is the 9-year-old Orderly Departure Program,said Judith Kumin, spokeswoman for the office of the U.N. HighCommissioner for Refugees.   The meeting normally occurs in autumn.   Arrivals in Hong Kong increased from 798 in January throughMarch to 1,381 in April and 1,596 in the first two weeks of May,Ms. Kumin told a weekly U.N. news briefing.   She said it was the highest level since 1979. Arrivals inMalaysia also are above average, with 2,917 in the first quarter of1988 and 1,904 in April, she said.   The Orderly Departure Program was negotiated to give Vietnamesewith relatives living abroad a safe, legal alternative to the risksof fleeing their country by land or by sea as boat people. It hasenabled more than 136,000 Indochinese refugees to resettle in 24countries since June 1979, Ms. Kumin said.   Most refugees have gone to the United States and Canada, shesaid, and gave the numbers as 65,176 and 24,615 respectively.   In 1984, the United States called for expansion of the programby offering to admit all Amerasian children _ most of whose fatherswere U.S. servicemen _ and their close relatives, as well aspolitical prisoners and their close family members.   Ms. Kumin said the Amerasian question also was on the agenda ofthe annual meeting, scheduled to end Tuesday.</TEXT></DOC>
