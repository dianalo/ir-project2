Think of Louisiana that way -- as Argentina, perhaps --and this fall's bizarre, nationally important gubernatorialelection becomes more comprehensible. Think of it, suggestsLouisiana political analyst John Maginnis, as &quot;America's lastbanana republic.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   It's a telling analogy. Louisiana is rich in oil and richin poor people. Louisiana periodically elects LatinAmerican-type strongmen as governor. Strongmen like thelegendary Huey Long: &quot;The King-fish&quot; who succored the poor,governed like a dictator and died after being shot in thetowering capitol he built. Louisiana tolerates, evencelebrates, the strongman-as-rapscallion. Rapscallions likeEdwin Edwards, who once boasted that the only things thatcould keep him from the governor's mansion would be gettingcaught in bed with &quot;a dead girl or a live boy.&quot; Corruption,as pervasive as oxygen, fuels and lubricates the politicalsystem.   Now, says Mr. Maginnis, who publishes a state politicalnewsletter, Louisiana is embroiled in &quot;the race from Hell.&quot;Rarely does a gubernatorial vote intertwine so many nationalissues -- abortion, race relations and the emerging southernstrategy of the Bush White House -- with candidates sooutlandish and improbable.   One of them is incumbent Gov. Buddy Roemer, the prizetrophy in an ongoing White House drive to convert sittingsouthern Democratic officeholders to the GOP. When Gov.Roemer declared himself a Republican last March, he becamethe GOP's highest-ranking convert in decades. There is agaggle of other candidates in the Oct. 19 election -- if noone wins a majority, there's a Nov. 16 runoff between the twotop finishers -- but the campaign centers on Mr. Roemer andtwo others. The three are as contrasting in personality as inthe issues they champion.   State Rep. David Duke, 41, is a former grand wizard of theKu Klux Klan and the founder of the National Association forthe Advancement of White People, who worries that &quot;thefoundations of our country are being eroded&quot; by a risingnon-white population. Mr. Duke, who says he left the Klan adozen or so years ago, says that in any event his particularKlan was non-violent and ceremonial in nature, &quot;just like theMasons.&quot; And what were those ceremonies like? &quot;I never wore ahood but I wore a robe,&quot; he says.   Politically, Mr. Duke is for real. He drew 45% of thetotal vote, and 60% of the white vote, in an unsuccessfulU.S. Senate race last year. Running as a Republican, he's anembarrassment to the national party. If he ever won statewideoffice, he'd be a potential presidential candidate. &quot;I've gotthat George Wallace kind of appeal,&quot; he says.   Edwin Edwards is a Democrat who's closest to the populisttradition of Huey Long. Mr. Edwards is a former three-termgovernor who was twice indicted but never convicted. &quot;Peoplelike to boast about how honest they are,&quot; he says. &quot;I've gotall kinds of pieces of papers to prove it. I've been through16 grand juries.&quot; He revels in his roguish image. Asked aboutone written account that had him, as governor, cruisingLouisiana State University's sorority row in a big white car,Mr. Edwards doesn't miss a beat. &quot;I don't suggest to you thatI've never dated a sorority girl,&quot; he says. &quot;But I've nevergone to pick her up in a limousine.&quot;   It was his son who did that, he says.   But the race pivots around incumbent Gov. Roemer,nationally known for his unsuccessful veto of Louisiana'stoughest-in-the-nation abortion law. (A court has sinceinvalidated the law, and the fight is likely to go to theSupreme Court.) Gov. Roemer is point man in a Bushadministration strategy to deny higher office to Mr. Duke.The boyish governor, 47, is Harvard-educated, a reformer --and a man seemingly deep in his own midlife crisis.   Intense and impatient, Mr. Roemer was elected as anavenging angel who'd clean up Louisiana. But he saw hismarriage crumble and his ambitious proposals collide with anindifferent legislature and skeptical public. Now he istrying to change his very personality. His inspiration isRobert Fulghum, author of &quot;All I Really Need to Know ILearned in Kindergarten.&quot;   Gov. Roemer is trying to &quot;honor&quot; people and theirfeelings. A big banner -- &quot;HONOR&quot; -- hangs in his office.He's trying to emphasize &quot;the journey instead of thedestination.&quot; In his annual address last April, he told anonplused legislature: &quot;I think it's time to light thecampfire so that we can see each other better. I think it'stime to . . . feel the power of the tribal family and beginafresh.&quot;   But the tribal family is restless out there. A recent pollfound 59% of Louisianians want someone else to be governor.Polls show a large number of voters view him negatively, ledby religious conservatives who were outraged by his veto ofthe anti-abortion bill. (Candidates Duke and Edwards haveeven higher negatives, for other reasons.) To shore Mr.Roemer up, both President Bush and Vice President Quayle arecoming to Louisiana late this month, and national Republicanoperatives are here to undergird his campaign.   The Roemer campaign obliquely acknowledges the governor'spopularity problems, but portrays him as a determined mandoing a dirty job that had to be done. One TV spot declaresthat &quot;America laughed&quot; at Louisiana until Mr. Roemer camealong, and concludes: &quot;It's painful, but Buddy Roemer isdoing what we elected him to do. . . . We can't turn theclock back now.&quot;   With the &quot;Roemer Revolution&quot; at best half-finished, Mr.Roemer's electoral fate will signal the future direction ofthis state. That's because Buddy Roemer -- a reformer and atechnocrat in a state that's traditionally scorned both --has launched a frontal assault on the way Louisiana does itspolitical business. What may be the fundamental, if unspoken,issue in this campaign is whether Louisiana stops treatingpolitics like Mardi Gras and moves at least part way towardthe more sedate, issue-oriented campaigns of other states.   For openers, Gov. Roemer persuaded the legislature tocurtail the influence of money in politics. Louisiana's newcampaign finance law limits contributions in the governor'srace to $5,000 for individuals and most political actioncommittees. Perhaps not coincidently, this good-governmentmeasure has also proven good for the Roemer re-electioneffort. By drying up contributions for all candidates, ittends to hurt challengers the most.   &quot;It's a new-style Louisiana politics,&quot; says Gus Weill, apolitical consultant, author and playwright here. &quot;There's nodough for anybody but the incumbent.&quot; As of July, Gov. Roemerhad raised nearly $1.6 million, more than three times theamount raised by ex-Gov. Edwards.   Other successful Roemer initiatives include an educationpackage with pay raises for teachers and a grading system forindividual schools; a wetlands conservation fund; toughersolid-waste disposal standards; and a transportation trustfund that's constitutionally protected against legislativeraids. He has weathered a budget crunch caused by depressedoil revenue and seen the state's bond rating rise. But helost big when voters rejected a sweeping fiscal overhaul thatincluded higher property and income taxes for middle- toupper-income taxpayers. That so depressed him that heretreated to the governor's mansion for weeks.   Notwithstanding that crushing setback, polls indicatevoters tend to like Roemer policies. It's the tightly woundman behind those policies that unsettles them. The governorsays that, Fulghum-like, he's working hard at mellowing out.But the changeover is far from complete. Asked for aself-description, Mr. Roemer says: &quot;Quick, often wrong, buthard-headed.&quot;   Some strange incidents have contributed to the notion thatBuddy Roemer is not your typical Louisiana governor. Helistens closely to an aide and friend who, believing in thepower of positive thinking, wears a rubber band around hiswrist; whenever a negative thought intrudes, the aide snapsthe band and mutters, &quot;Cancel. Cancel.&quot; Mr. Roemer upset thenew Japanese consul general by greeting him in blue jeans.And the New Orleans Times-Picayune recently reported that hewent to a big New Orleans Saints football game in theSuperdome -- and read a book.   Personalities count for more than party labels inLouisiana, whose open primary system throws candidates of allpolitical persuasions together in a gumbo-like mix. Gov.Roemer's base lies in educated professionals andsuburbanites. Edwin Edwards's base lies in the blacks and hisfellow Cajuns. David Duke's base is in northern Louisianahill country and Mississippi Delta whites and religiousfundamentalists.   Some political analysts think the best things Mr. Roemerhas going for him are opponents Edwards and Duke. &quot;Roemer ischange,&quot; argues Mr. Maginnis, the analyst. &quot;Edwards and Dukeare not change.&quot; There is, however, a third challenger whoalso represents change. She's Public Service CommissionerKathleen Blanco, who's both personable and reform-minded. Ifnothing else, she could cut into Roemer support (as well ascutting into Cajun support for Mr. Edwards). But Mrs. Blancois underfunded and, like Messrs. Edwards and Duke, says shewouldn't have vetoed the controversial abortion bill. Thus,Gov. Roemer has Louisiana's abortion-rights vote all tohimself.   Summarizing this strange and angry race, pollster andLoyola University political scientist Edward Renwick says thegovernor is &quot;doing very poorly for an incumbent&quot; -- butMessrs. Edwards and Duke are doing very poorly aschallengers. &quot;Nobody has broken out of the pack,&quot; he says.   Right now, the polls indicate Messrs. Roemer and Edwardsin a tight race and headed for the runoff, with Mr. Duke inthird place. But Louisiana isn't a place where one should puttoo much stock in polls -- especially where David Duke isconcerned. His strong showing last year against veteranDemocratic Sen. J. Bennett Johnston confounded the experts;apparently many white voters denied they were going to votefor Mr. Duke, then did so anyway. Mr. Duke himself says that&quot;you can't poll {voter support for} David Duke because heflies below radar.&quot; If the polls this time understate Mr.Duke's support by even five percentage points, Mr. Renwicksays, &quot;it's a real dicey contest.&quot;   The three leading candidates spend at least as much timedefending themselves as attacking one another. Mr. Edwardstried to project a more subdued image in a 30-minute TV ad.But the effort was partly undone when the divorced,64-year-old candidate hit the campaign trail with a26-year-old friend named Candy on his arm.   Voters like such things, he says, and &quot;in any event, it'smy basic disposition.&quot; He adds: &quot;For all my problems, andI've got many, everybody knows I'm a man of my word.&quot; And,brushing off his two corruption trials, he declares: &quot;I'mfast, compromising, but in Richard Nixon's words, `I am not acrook.'&quot;   Mr. Duke works to play down his image as a whitesupremacist or -- some critics argue -- a neo-Nazi. &quot;A lot ofstories were written that if David Duke came into this house{of representatives} he'd have a pillowcase over his head,&quot;he says. &quot;It didn't happen.&quot; In 1989, a group of concernedcitizens confirmed through purchases that he was selling Naziand anti-Semitic literature out of his home. Mr. Duke says heis no longer in the book-selling business, and adds: &quot;I alsosold the works of St. Paul, although I'm not one of the 12disciples.&quot;   That, says Mr. Weill, the author and political consultant,is Louisiana's problem -- too few saints and disciples, toomany sinners. If the title weren't already taken, he says,there'd be a good book about Louisiana called &quot;Cry, TheBeloved Country.&quot;   &quot;We have squandered untold treasures and don't have muchto show for it,&quot; Mr. Weill adds. &quot;Many of our politicianshave done us wrong.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
