The soldier's parents also were on the way to spendChristmas with him.   ``He did say that he wanted to go back _ I don't think that'spossible,'' the soldier's brother said.   Air Force Capt. Peter Debusmann, commander of a C-141 transportplane that brought 21 injured servicemen to Kelly Air Force Base,said the soldiers aboard were in good spirits.   ``They're just glad to be coming home, back to the States, andhome for Christmas.
