Therefore the academy recommends the aggressive promotion of condoms, birth-control pills and abortions. It is likely that the academy's recommendations -- which Secretary of Education William Bennett called &quot;dumb policy&quot; -- will sink like a rock. Nonetheless this study of sex and pregnancy among black teen-agers by a prominent group of U.S. social scientists deserves attention and discussion.    It bears attention as a clear example of what separates the attitudes and values of dominant liberals from everyone these liberals regard as their political enemies -- traditional conservatives, neoconservatives, the New Right, and increasingly, moderate Democrats who wish to pull away from dominant liberal beliefs.    The issue this study addresses is the high incidence of pregnancy and illegitimate birth among poor, mostly black adolescents. Liberals believe they are &quot;for&quot; whatever will help these adolescents, and that conservatives are &quot;against&quot; such helpful policies. That is a simple formulation, but the level of &quot;debate&quot; on these issues doesn't often get beyond the simple. The academy's study, however, gets us closer to the heart of the matter.    The academy's black-pregnancy study reflects the policy assumptions and values of the same people who designed and implemented the poverty program. While poor persons existed in the U.S. before the 1960s, that was the decade when &quot;poverty&quot; became an active issue. Social scientists were centrally involved in this process, and since that time we have all come to discuss poor people in the language of social science. For 20 years, debate has taken place around the jargon of this general proposition: Policy makers should develop programs whose implementation will ameliorate a social problem within a given class of people.    Conservatives have always worried that framing the debate this way would dehumanize the persons involved. Conservatives would talk of individual responsibility, and while this view often implied responsibility for one's failings or personal inadequacies, it also worried about losing sight of individual successes among &quot;the poor.&quot; And indeed blacks have begun complaining recently that the liberal media are obsessed with black failure and the pathology of poverty at the expense of black success.    The policies proposed in this pregnancy study may be read as a frank admission of liberalism's failure during the period it has claimed stewardship over black life in the U.S. To offer a &quot;broad and dispassionate&quot; review of past &quot;interventions&quot; toward black pregnancy and conclude that the only thing to be done is promote condoms and abortions is an admission of failure.    Condoms and abortions aren't social policy. They are mechanical devices masquerading as policy. To reach such a conclusion reflects a willful refusal to recognize people as anything other than subcategories of a social class. The study states: &quot;Nonmarital sexuality for both men and women had long been accepted in the black community (Ladner, 1972; Moore et al., 1986).&quot; Accepted? By 28 million U.S. blacks?    The academy's authors raise a related, key area of disagreement -- morality. They note: &quot;The early 1980s have seen the emergence of a new conservatism.&quot; Advocates of the &quot;new morality,&quot; they say, &quot;attribute the rise in adolescent pregnancy to a disintegration of moral values.&quot; The study's authors demur. &quot;Science,&quot; they say dispassionately, &quot;cannot resolve issues that are inextricably bound to differences in human values. . . .&quot;    Not all liberals have become quite so morally disinterested, but in their obsession with not being morally judgmental, liberals gradually have broken their policy making free of any identifiable moral system. They have come to regard being &quot;for&quot; certain policies, such as publicly funded social-welfare programs or South Africa sanctions, as itself an act of morality. But this belief never reaches the fact that the success of their policies depends entirely on how individual human beings treat other individuals.    There is no relationship between a morally well-intended liberal policy and how a young male treats his girlfriend. Indeed it is possible that without some identifiable, commonly held set of moral rules no program directed at teen-aged pregnancy will ever succeed. Liberals, by ridiculing every effort of conservatives to reintroduce individual moral concerns into the formation of public policy (recall the widespread mockery of the Meese pornography commission) may be assuring the continued failure of their own initiatives. </TEXT></DOC>
