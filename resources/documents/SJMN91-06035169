Douglas Wilder of Virginia said on ABC-TV's&quot;Good Morning, America&quot; program. &quot;The question now is whether Congress will goalong with it.&quot;;    Only a few hours before the White House meeting, thegovernors saw Bush's list of about $21 billion in proposed block grantprograms in the new federal budget. By 1996, the programs would be worth about$22 billion. In proposing the transfer, Bush suggested that the federal andstate governments could agree on about $15 billion in programs from thatlist.;    The proposed grants were in five areas: $1.77 billion in education;$2.20 billion in Environmental Protection Agency construction grants; $9.66billion in welfare, social services and energy assistance to low incomefamilies; $6.90 billion for housing and community development programs; and$421 million for law enforcement assistance.;    Bush told the governors hisplan would be &quot;fully funded. . . . I am very grateful to those who have spokenout on it already. I am not naive; we are going to have to fight together toget this through the Congress.&quot;;    Gov. Booth Gardner, a Washington Democratwho is chairman of the National Governors' Association, said on the NBC&quot;Today&quot; show that the Bush plan was &quot;very attractive&quot; but added that &quot;it'lltake a lot of work with Congress to get that accomplished.&quot;;    He likened theWhite House approach to &quot;a car salesman saying, take the car, drive it for acouple of months. If you don't like it, give it back.&quot;;    At a meeting withgovernors Sunday, White House Chief of Staff John Sununu, himself a formergovernor of New Hampshire, emphasized that the list was just a workingdocument and that the president would welcome suggestions from the states.;   &quot;The $15 billion is what we're estimating is the most likely number we canget,&quot; he said as he emerged from the closed meeting. &quot;If all 22 (billiondollars) are accepted, that's fine. If the governors come up with another 10billion (dollars) they want to add to that to make it 32, we'll even behappier.&quot;;    Gov. Pete Wilson of California, a former Republican senator,also appeared on &quot;Good Morning, America&quot; and stressed that &quot;we have to manage,Congress doesn't. But typically, Congress . . . likes to micromanage.&quot;;    Headded that &quot;Congress can hold us accountable. We don't object to that. But wedon't want them telling us how to manage.&quot;;    Republican Jim Edgar ofIllinois said that if the proposal is enacted, &quot;we realize we've got to keepgoing back to Congress and make sure they don't forget those programs.&quot; But hesaid the plan &quot;gives us a lot better ability to manage our ownresponsibilities.&quot;;    The budget message said the turnover of programs&quot;allows the federal government to reduce overhead. It allows the states tomanage a pool of financial resources more flexibly.&quot;;    By far, the largestsingle category in Bush's list was $5.87 billion for administrative costs forMedicaid, Aid to Families with Dependent Children, and food stamps.;   Reaction to the plan was cool among mayors, however, who fear losing the onlyremaining major direct federal urban aid, the $3.2 billion CommunityDevelopment Block Grant program. If included in the shift, it would establishthe states as a new intermediary for a program that now largely goes directlyfrom the federal government to cities.;    &quot;We would be opposed to it going tothe states because what happens in most states is the legislature is much morerural and suburban focused,&quot; said Mayor Jerry Abramson of Louisville, Ky.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910204  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  5A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  701  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday February 4, 199100035169,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
