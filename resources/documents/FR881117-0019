Background  </ITAG>The uniform regulation for the procurement of supplies and services byFederal departments and agencies, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR),was promulgated on September 19, 1983 (48 CFR 42102). The FAR was codifiedin Title 48, Chapter 1 of the Code of Federal Regulations. HUD promulgatedits regulation to implement the FAR on March 1, 1984 (49 FR 7696). TheHUD Acquisition Regulation (HUDAR) was revised in an interim rule publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of November 8, 1985 (50 FR 46572) to implementthe Competition in Contracting Act of 1984.  <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Proposed Rule for the Addition of Parts 2452 and 2453  </ITAG>The proposed HUDAR rule of December 8, 1987, supplemented the FAR by addingsolicitation provisions, contract clauses, and HUD forms to the HUDAR.In addition, the proposed rule implemented the Prompt Payment Act (31 U.S.C.3901-3906) and OMB Circular A-109, ``Major Systems Acquisition.'' Becauseof the impact of the rule on the public, the Department published theseHUDAR changes as proposed rulemaking and provided for a public commentperiod of 60 days. No public comments were received. However, HUD has determinedthat several revisions to the proposed rule are necessary in light of recentchanges to the FAR and to reflect the Department's current procurementprocedures.  <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Revisions to the Proposed Rule  </ITAG>A. Ratification of Unauthorized Commitments  Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 84-33 (53 FR 3688), dated February 8,1988, amended the FAR by adding section 1.602-3, Ratification of UnauthorizedCommitments. HUDAR 2401.602-70 is therefore removed and a new 2401.602-3is added to provide necessary internal procedures. In addition, a paragraph(c)(5) is added to establish that the Contracting Officer or Head of theContracting Activity authorized payments and, at their discretion, mayseek legal concurrence when there is a concern regarding the proprietyof the funding source, appropriateness of the expense, or a legal issueis involved.  B. Prompt Payment Act  FAC 84-33 also implemented the Prompt Payment Act (31 U.S.C. 3901-3906)and OMB Circular A-125, ``Prompt Payment.'' Proposed HUDAR coverage at2432.900-2432.903 is therefore removed. HUDAR clauses at 2432.232-70, ``Payment(Fixed-Price),'' and 2432.232-71, ``Payment (Cost-Reimbursement),'' havebeen revised and renamed ``Payment Schedule and Invoice Submission (Fixed-Price)''and ``Voucher Submission (Cost-Reimbursement),'' respectively. All duplicativelanguage as reflected in FAR 52.232-25 has been removed. The clauses asnow written merely contain instructions on where invoices/vouchers areto be submitted. HUDAR 2452.232-72, ``Method of Payment,'' has been removedin its entirety in light of the FAR coverage.  C. Addition and Modification of Clauses  A prescription at 2422.1408(c) and the related clause at 2452.222-70, ``Accessibilityof Meetings, Conferences, and Seminars to Persons with Disabilities,''are added to require that contractors ensure that any meetings, conferences,and seminars conducted under the contract are accessible to disabled persons,per Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended.  HUDAR 2452.237-75, ``Clearance of Personnel,'' has been amended to addthe requirement that contractor staff working on-site must have temporaryidentification/building passes. This reflects current Departmental procedure. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Other HUDAR Revisions  </ITAG>The Office of Housing reorganized in 1986. All references to Chief, Reconditioningand Contracting Branch, Office of Multifamily Housing Management, are thereforerevised to Chief, Management Branch, Office of Multifamily Housing Management,to reflect the reorganization.  The definition of ``Head of Contracting Activity'' at 2402.101 has beenrevised to add the Regional Director, Office of Housing, for decentralizedprocurement for acquired properties in co-located Regional/Field Offices. HUDAR 2419.503 pertaining to small business class set-asides for constructionhas been revised to state that this set-aside only pertains to contractsawarded under the Acquired Property Program. When the HUDAR was first published,only the Acquired Property Program awarded construction contracts. However,since that time, HUD has engaged in other construction contracts pertainingto HUD's management and operation of its Headquarters building. Therefore,the clarification is required to reflect the original intent.  Part 2470, ``Special Programs Affecting Acquisition,'' has been changedto Part 2426, ``Other Socioeconomic Programs.'' This change was requiredto implement FAC 84-32 (53 FR 660), dated January 11, 1988, which createdFAR Part 26. The text, however, has not been revised.  The prescription at 2427.305-2 for use of the Form HUD 770, ``Report ofInventions and Subcontracts,'' has been modified to state that the ContractingOfficer need only send the form if the work conducted under the contractwas such that patents or inventions may have been developed. HUDAR 2432.410 has been removed. This passage stated that the Determinationand Findings required by FAR 32.402(c)(1)(iii) regarding advance paymentscould be issued by the Head of the Contracting Activity (HCA) only if aspecific delegation of authority has been issued. However, proposed 2432.402states that the Director of the Office of Procurement and Contracts (OPC)makes these determinations. Upon reviewing delegations of authority, itwas discovered that the Director, OPC, is the only HCA with the specificdelegated authority. Therefore, 2432.410 is unnecessary and is hereby removed.HUDAR 2434.001, which establishes the Department's threshold for a ``majorsystem'' to $15,000,000, has been revised to state that the Senior ProcurementExecutive may waive the requirements of OMB Circular A-109 if an acquisitionexceeds the dollar threshold but does not otherwise meet the definitionof a major system. In addition, a section 2434.003 has been added to designatethe Senior Procurement Executive as the individual responsible for implementationof A-109. This designation is consistent with internal Departmental directives.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Provisional Portion of Regulation </ITAG>The following clauses/provisions have been submitted to the FAR Councilsfor consideration for FAR coverage: <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,s25,11</C>  <H1>Clause/Provision</H1><H1>HUD cite</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Organizational Conflict of Interest Certification<D>2452.209-71 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Organizational Conflict of Interest Clause<D>2452.209-72 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Unpriced Task Orders<D>2452.216-75 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Reproduction of Reports<D>2452.237-71 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Coordination of Data Collection Activities<D>2452.237-72 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Technical Direction<D>2452.237-74 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Clearance of Personnel<D>2452.237-75</D></ITAG></ITAG> These provisions/clauses are therefore designated as ``provisional''. Shouldthe FAR Councils adopt a rule based on these provisions/clauses, HUD willrescind the provisional rule in favor of the FAR coverage. <ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Miscellaneous </ITAG>This rule would not constitute a ``major rule'' as the term is definedin section 1(b) of Executive Order 12291. This rule does not (1) have anannual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; (2) cause a majorincrease in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal,State, or local agencies or geographic regions; or (3) have a significantadverse effect on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovationor on the ability of the United States-based enterprises to compete withforeign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets. The revisionsin this rule would involve modifications of various Departmental proceduresfor HUD procurement activities. These modifications primarily involve thecodification of procedures involving certain solicitation provisions, contractclauses, and forms that have been implemented by HUD for many years. In accordance with section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5U.S.C. 605(b)), the Undersigned certifies that this rule would not havea significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entitiesbecause this rule merely codifies current Departmental procedures. The information collection burdens associated with these procurement procedureshave been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under the provisionsof the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 and have been assigned OMB controlnumbers 2502-0278, 2535-0306, 2535-0085, and 2535-0091. A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment hasbeen made in accordance with HUD regulations in 24 CFR Part 50, which implementsection 102(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C.4332). The Finding of No Significant Impact is available for public inspectionduring regular business hours in the Office of the General Counsel, RulesDocket Clerk, Room 10276, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410.This rule is listed as item 1050 in the Department's Semiannual Agendaof Regulations published on October 24, 1988 (53 FR 41974, 42008) underExecutive Order 12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 48 CFR Parts 2401, 2402, 2406, 2409, 2412, 2413,2414, 2415, 2416, 2417, 2419, 2422, 2424, 2426, 2427, 2432, 2434, 2437,2442, 2446, 2451, 2452, and 2453</ITAG>Government procurement.Accordingly, Title 48, Chapter 24 of the Code of Federal Regulations isproposed to be amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="72">Subchapter A_General</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">PART 2401_FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION SYSTEM</ITAG>1.
