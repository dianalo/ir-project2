If the deal goes through, the LTV operations would be runas a 50-50 venture. The entity would have no competitiverestraints, meaning that it could go up against MartinMarietta and Lockheed for new business. Pointing out that ajoint-venture approach will spread the risk for the buyersand enhance their chances of winning new contracts, someindustry executives hailed the innovative arrangement. Theypredicted that others may be inclined to take the same tackas the defense industry consolidates.</LP><TEXT>   A spokesman for Martin Marietta, Bethesda, Md., declinedto comment on the prospective purchase, which has beenrumored in the aerospace community for weeks. In Calabasas,Calif., a Lockheed spokeswoman also wouldn't comment.   LTV's aerospace and defense unit, which has annual salesof more than $2 billion, has been on the block since lastMay. A spokesman for the Dallas company, which is operatingunder bankruptcy-court protection, said bids were received inNovember and LTV continues to review offers from variouspotential buyers.   Indeed, insiders cautioned that other attractive offersbesides that from Martin Marietta and Lockheed are still onthe table. They apparently include one from Boeing Co. andanother from French electronics giant Thomson S.A. A Thomsonbid could be complicated, however, because of nationalsecurity issues, one industry executive suggested. LoralCorp. also is said to have made an offer to LTV, but only forthe company's missile lines.   Officials from Thomson, Boeing and Loral either declinedto comment or couldn't be reached.   LTV would clearly prefer to unload both its missile andaircraft businesses all at once, if possible. That's onefactor that apparently makes the Martin Marietta-Lockheedproposal particularly enticing. One executive said thediscussions were far enough along that Martin Mariettamanagers hoped to make a presentation on the acquisition atthe company's next board meeting, which is set for Jan. 23.Lockheed's next scheduled board meeting is Feb 3.   One issue complicating things is LTV's bankruptcy. Whenthe aerospace and defense unit was put up for sale, somecreditors groused that it shouldn't be unloaded because it'spotentially lucrative. In addition, because any sale wouldhave to be approved by the bankruptcy court, it's alwayspossible that last-minute offers will emerge to top a MartinMarietta-Lockheed bid. Just last month, LTV's three largestcreditor groups persuaded the court to consider a secondoffer for the company's AM General Corp. subsidiary.   Besides that, any acquisition would conceivably have topass federal antitrust review.   If LTV is able to shed the unit, it would mark one of thefirst major steps in the compression of the defense industry,which many believe is poised for a shakeout. When LTV's unitwas first put up for sale last year, Lockheed Chairman DanielTellep generally questioned the wisdom of mergers. &quot;Theproblem is you take two companies with overcapacity and allyou have is more overcapacity,&quot; he said.   But upon closer inspection, Mr. Tellep seems to have foundLTV's operations promising. The unit, which posted operatingprofit of $101.7 million through the first nine months of1991, builds large parts of the B-2 Stealth bomber and C-17cargo plane. It also manufactures the Multi-Launch RocketSystem, a range of missiles and pieces for the StrategicDefense Initiative. Perhaps most significant, given theshrinking Pentagon budget, is that the unit also has a strongcommercial sector, building the tail sections for Boeingjetliners.   Wall Street analysts have pointed out that both Lockheedand Martin Marietta will generate plenty of excess cash overthe next five years. Executives also pointed out that Mr.Tellep is good friends with Norman Augustine, MartinMarietta's chairman.   Separately, Martin Marietta shares climbed $1.50 yesterdayin New York Stock Exchange composite trading, to close at$53.375, after the company was awarded a $269 millionproduction contract and option to supply Vertical LaunchingSystems to the U.S. Navy and for a foreign military sale toJapan. The pact calls for production of the missile-firingequipment to begin immediately with deliveries through 1996.   Lockheed shares finished unchanged on the Big Board at$43.875.</TEXT></DOC>
