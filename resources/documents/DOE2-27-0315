There are three main reasons this large amount can be ascribedto: with natural gas extraction and natural gas imports come to replacenatural gas produced on the basis of coal and petroleum, natural gassupply infrastructures were due for modifications and rearrangements;the increasing number of natural gas consumers necessitated additionalconnections; structural industry-to-private-household-changes resultedin higher peak loads and increased the temperature dependence of naturalgas supplies. The development described is also manifest in the apportionmentof investment budgets changing in the course of time. Substantial achievementsto be attributed to investments since 1960 consist in the two and a halftimes extension of natural gas distribution networks (190 000 km as ofstate of 1986), the construction of more than 20 underground storagesystems (4 billion m/sup 3/ volumetric capacity), as well as in the installationof numerous pressure vessels, gas production and conditioning facilities.</TEXT></DOC>
