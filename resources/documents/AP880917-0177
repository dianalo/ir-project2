More than 5,000 people left shelters around town early Saturdayafter the main force of Hurricane Gilbert passed through Mexicoabout 100 miles to the south.   ``I'm kind of glad to be back home. I didn't know what I wasgoing to find. My house is 80 years old and I thought it was goingto be blown away but it wasn't,'' said Odilon Gracia, 75.   He said he waited out the storm at an elementary school with aleaking roof and wet floors. ``I feel a little better in my housethan at that school,'' he said.   While the shelters emptied, the city grew congested. Restaurantsand food stores closed for two days opened their doors again. Carslined up at gas stations.</TEXT><DATELINE>BROWNSVILLE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Officials predicted disaster andtalked of fingerprinting those who stayed behind to identify theirbodies. Gulf coast residents from Grand Isle, La., to thistip-of-Texas town boarded up their windows and fled.   But in the end, it was Gilbert, ``the storm of the century,''who stayed away _ turning out to be too big to turn north, toogracious to blast the U.S. coast.   ``We were waiting for the storm, but it never showed up,'' saidFrancisco Garcia as he used a crowbar to pry plywood off hisfamily's barbecue hut. ``Some people are mad a little bit that theyspent money and the hurricane never showed up.''</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   George Bush has dropped a line from his stockcampaign speech: the one about being the underdog and liking it.   Little more than a month ago, the vice president was trailingDemocrat Michael Dukakis in national public opinion polls by doubledigits. Now, most polls show Bush has seized the agenda and iseither leading Dukakis or is even with him.   Political professionals offer differing explanations for Bush'srapid rise. But most suggest a combination of factors: hiswell-received convention address, a series of speeches that putDukakis on the defensive, and the failure of questions over runningmate Dan Quayle's military record to stick as a major liability.   Some analysts also cite quick damage control on the part ofBush's campaign team, led by campaign chairman James A. Baker III,in minimizing possible embarrassments _ such as the quickresignations last week of Bush operative Frederic Malek and sixmembers of an ethnic coalition after allegations of anti-Semiticactivities surfaced.</TEXT><DATELINE>BUENA PARK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Democrat Michael Dukakis, declaringRepublican George Bush has provided ``zero protection for theenvironment,'' proposed Saturday elevating the EnvironmentalProtection Agency to a Cabinet department.   ``And the first secretary of the Environment is going to be ascommitted to protecting the environment as George Bush has been toneglecting it,'' the Democratic presidential candidate told acheering crowd of campaign workers.   Dukakis drew a roar of approval from several hundred volunteerswhen he referred to rhetorical flubs by the Republican ticket.   ``Dan Quayle doesn't know what century he's in and George Bushcan't remember the Pledge of Allegiance,'' he said.   From California, Dukakis flew to Washington, D.C., to share thespotlight at the annual Congressional Black Caucus dinner withJesse Jackson.</TEXT><DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Radical students demonstrating againstthe Olympic Games and the government have seen their supportdwindle to a handful of diehards, and most Koreans have rejectedtheir violent extremism.   The radical movement has lost ground as hope grows in SouthKorea that political reforms will end the nation's long traditionof authoritarian rule and produce an enduring democratic system.   Many Koreans, including a growing number of students, sayviolent anti-government protests are no longer necessary. Peopleare increasingly critical of the radicals.   Demonstrations against the Olympics, which began Saturday, havebeen small by Korean standards with the turnout dropping each day.Protests have been confined to campuses away from the Olympicvenues and many have been peaceful.</TEXT><DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Japan operated a secret chemical weapons factoryduring World War II, bombed China with poison gas grenades andtested poison on prisoners of war, including Americans, a newreport charges.   The report in the October issue of the Chicago-based Bulletin ofthe Atomic Scientists also contends the U.S. government knew aboutJapan's use of chemical weapons but failed to prosecute Japaneseofficers at the Tokyo war crimes tribunal in 1946.   The report's author, Yuki Tanaka, speculated the U.S. governmentdecided against prosecuting because it wanted to learn from Japan'sknowledge of bacteriological warfare.   Tanaka, a lecturer in Japanese at the University of Adelaide inAustralia, drew on newly discovered Japanese war documents, his owninterviews and previously published material to piece together theaccount, said Len Ackland, the Bulletin's editor.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Rep. Ken Gray says that in his southernIllinois district, support for the National Rifle Association isalmost as strong as for the Pledge of Allegiance.   So when the NRA told Gray's constituents to make sure he votedagainst a waiting period for handgun purchases, they responded.   A week ago, they surrounded his car in the district andvirtually kept him prisoner inside until he promised to help stripthe waiting period from an anti-drug bill.   They repeated verbatim all the NRA arguments _ especially thefear that this was the beginning of the end of gun ownership.</TEXT><DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Subscribers to Index on Censorship got a surprisethis month. Instead of the usual reports of suppression of freespeech by dictatorships, the entire issue of the small butrespected journal was devoted to Britain.   It reflected growing alarm among editors, broadcasters and civillibertarians that Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government isadding censorship to Britain's already extensive official secrecy.   From repeated attempts to suppress news about Northern Irelandto a worldwide government campaign to ban the publication of anintelligence veteran's memoirs, the list of recent controversiesover media freedom has grown dramatically.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Organization of American States, facingthe worst financial crisis of its history, may be forced to lay offas many as 300 of its 1,000 employees over the next few months,according to OAS sources.   The crisis is based largely on the Reagan administration'sdecision to reduce its 1988 contribution to the OAS by $10 millionand by the same amount next year. Compounding the problem is thefailure of several other major contributors, including Chile andVenezuela, to keep their payments current, the sources said.   The impending layoffs have generated gloom and uncertainty amongOAS employees, most of whom are Latin Americans who are faced withthe prospect of the immediate loss of their U.S. visas if theirjobs are eliminated.</TEXT><DATELINE>MANSFIELD, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   ``He was so ugly he had to sneak up onbreakfast,'' one tale-spinner said, as ``Once upon a time ...''took on a down-home flavor out at the eighth annual NorthernAppalachian Storytelling Festival.   Storytelling often has been relegated to the children's hour atlibraries, storytellers said at the weekend event at MansfieldUniversity in north-central Pennsylvania.   But now they said they are in demand for everything from therapyfor emotionally disturbed children to corporate picnics.
