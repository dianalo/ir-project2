<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-82-0606 </DOCNO><TEXT>The diffusivity of oxygen and sulfur in a thermally grown Cr{sub 2}O{sub3} have been determined by means of electrical conductivity measurements.Electrical conductivity of the oxide at temperatures between 700{degree}Cand 950{degree}C and pO{sub 2} = 10{sup {minus}4} atm decreased due todoping of a trace amount of sulfur. The measured diffusivity of sulfurin Cr{sub 2}O{sub sub 3} is at least one to two orders of magnitude higherthan that of oxygen. The activation energy for oxygen diffusion is 3.53eV, whereas the value for sulfur diffusion, (0.8 eV) is much lower. Inorder to define the carrier concentration from electrical conductivitydata, the hole mobility was measured by applying a constant compositiontechnique. The solubility of sulfur decreased with an increase in temperature,but was almost constant below 800{degree}C. 22 refs. 12 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
