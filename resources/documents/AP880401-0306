Chrysler's new rebate program takes effect today and willcontinue indefinitely. The rebate or annual rates of 8.8 percent onloans of up to 72 months may be applied to purchases or leases ofthe Canadian-built car.   ``Eagle is a brand-new nameplate and customers are still unsurewhat it stands for,'' Chris Cedergren, analyst with J.D. Power andAssociates in suburban Los Angeles, said Thursday.   ``New models, when they are introduced in a market full ofincentives, need incentives on them now to draw attention,'' headded. Otherwise, buyers ignore the new cars and look for modelsbearing sale tags, he said.   ``Premier needed a level playing field. It has a chance tocompete now because it has incentives on it,'' Cedergren said.   William Hoglund, a GM vice president and executive in charge ofits Buick-Oldsmobile-Cadillac group, made similar comments earlierthis week about GM's new Buick Regal.   Despite pricing that GM considered low for a new model, Regal'ssales were disappointing until early March, when GM offeredoption-package discounts of up to $900 on the car, Hoglund said.   On Thursday, Buick and Oldsmobile extended incentives scheduledto expire April 15 until May 11, following a similar step byChevrolet earlier this week.   Buick extended rebates ranging from $400 to $750 on four modelsand option-package discounts on six models including Regal.Oldsmobile extended similar rebates on four models and optiondiscounts on six models.   As of March 20, Chrysler had sold only 5,086 Premier modelssince the car's introduction late last year, including 4,894 during1988. Cedergren said Chrysler had expected Premier to take offslowly.   However, he said, the car is reaching its target audience ofwell-to-do young buyers who otherwise wouldn't buy Chryslerproducts, most of which are aimed at buyers interested in pricesthat are usually lower than GM and Ford Motor Co.   ``It's not pirating sales away from other Chrysler models,''Cedergren said.   On the GM products, Buick rebates include $400 on Skylark and$750 on Century, LeSabre and Electra-Park Avenue. Cars must bedelivered by May 11. Rebates may be used as down payments or takenin cash.   Oldsmobile rebates include $400 on Calais and Cutlass Calais and$750 on Cutlass Ciera, Delta 88 and Ninety-Eight.   Option-package discounts are available on all rebate models aswell as Buick Regal and Skyhawk and Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme andToronado.</TEXT></DOC>
