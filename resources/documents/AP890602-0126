As they finished work on the bill for the week, senators votedby voice to allow the shipment of up to $12 million in food aid toHaiti.   Most forms of U.S. assistance to the Caribbean nation have beenprohibited by law because of human rights abuses in the country.But Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., the provision's sponsor, saidresumption of aid would be ``a recognition of progress that hasbeen made'' by the Haitian government.   On a voice vote, the Senate added a provision urging theAgriculture Department to buy more apples to help sagging salescaused by findings that Alar, a growth enhancer sprayed on someapples, can cause cancer. The measure was sponsored by Sens. BrockAdams, D-Wash., and Slade Gorton, R-Wash., whose home state is oneof the nation's leading apple producers.   Senate leaders had hoped to complete work on the measureThursday and begin negotiations next week with the House, which hasalready approved a $3.7 billion rendition of the bill. Thelegislation covers the final four months of fiscal 1989.   But the Senate spent much of its nearly 14 hours of workThursday debating an assortment of amendments aimed at boostingfederal anti-drug initiatives by as much as $1.8 billion. All ofthem failed by wide margins as lawmakers heeded Bush administrationwarnings that inclusion of the drug funds would pump up the federaldeficit and could spark a veto of the entire bill.   ``When are we going to end this effort to pile more money intothis bill for drugs?'' a frustrated Senate Appropriations ChairmanRobert Byrd, D-W.Va., asked at one point.   The House bill includes $822 million for treatment programs,tougher law enforcement, and other anti-drug efforts.   Senate completion of a measure without any drug funds, nowanticipated for next week, would augur a clash with the House whenthe two chambers try to work out a compromise bill. In a policystatement Thursday, the administration said it considered theSenate bill ``a major improvement'' over the House version.   The largest portion of both bills is $1.2 billion for health,benefit increases and other programs for veterans. The Departmentof Veterans Affairs has already begun curtailing the number ofpatients it treats at its hospitals and clinics, and furtherreductions have been threatened.   The Senate legislation provides $892 million for the GuaranteedStudent Loan program for college students, $423 million for statefoster care programs, $342 million for the expenses of battlinglast year's forest fires, $225 million for the food stamps program,$125 million for United Nations peacekeeping forces, and $100million to help Soviet and other refugees to this country.   Also in the Senate measure is money for projects in the homestates of many members of the appropriations panel, standardprocedure for spending bills.   The legislation contains $75 million to rebuild a demolished300-foot radio telescope in West Virginia, Byrd's home state; $7.3million to clean up the oil spill in Republican Sen. Ted Stevens'Alaska; $1.6 million for job training in Philadelphia, representedby Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa.; and $200,000 for the University ofSouth Carolina, compliments of Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., tostudy drug abuse among blacks.   Amendments adopted Thursday include one by Sen. Bob Dole,R-Kan., setting aside $275,000 for Kansas State University toprovide information for farmers on coping with the drought.   Another provision urges the federal court in New York handlingEastern Airlines' bankruptcy proceedings to consider appointing anindependent trustee to replace chief executive Frank Lorenzo inrunning the strike-bound carrier.   Another would provide an extra $1 million for development oforphan drugs, medications that companies find unprofitable toproduce because the diseases they treat are so rare.   Yet another expresed the Senate's desire to prevent appointmentof a Panama Canal Commission chief nominated by Panamanian rulerManuel Antonio Noriega. By treaty, the Panamanian government canname a new administrator for the commission, a nomination theSenate must approve.</TEXT></DOC>
