Overall the hot particles account for about 10% of the totalalpha particle activity of the sediments. At some horizons, in buriedsediments, concentrations of hot particles probably represent rapid transporton the sea surface under conditions of minimum erosion. Similar particles,usually less well defined, occur in accreting sediments but are corroded.Representative types of the most radioactive particles have been isolatedand contain Pu, Am and Cm but only trace amounts of naturally occuringalpha emitters. Microprobe analysis of these particles often shows thepresence of fairly pure uranium as the major element. On the basis ofradioactivity and elemental composition many of these particles appearto be irradiated nuclear fuel debris.</TEXT></DOC>
