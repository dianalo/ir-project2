It was the first bank to fail this year in New York. In Minnesota, First State Bank of Rollingstone also failed Friday, and its only office is to reopen today as a branch of Eastwood Bank St. Charles, St. Charles, Minn. A total of 126 banks have failed nationwide this year.    Central National had $170 million in deposits in 13,400 accounts. The FDIC couldn't immediately determine how many accounts exceeded the federally insured limit of $100,000. Depositors with more than $100,000 will share with the FDIC and creditors in proceeds from liquidation of the failed bank's $178.8 million in assets.    The New York bank was declared insolvent by the Comptroller of the Currency and over-the-counter trading in its shares was suspended Friday before the market opened. The comptroller's office, which oversees federally chartered banks, said it had been aware of problems at Central National since 1983 and had tried to commit the bank's directors to a recovery program. But &quot;deteriorating trends were not reversed,&quot; the agency said.    In Minnesota, Eastwood Bank St. Charles will assume $10.2 million of the failed First State Bank of Rollingstone's $14.5 million in assets and $13.7 million in deposits in 4,500 accounts. Eastwood paid the FDIC a purchase premium of about $142,000; the FDIC gave $3.4 million to Eastwood to enable the transaction and retained $4.3 million of the failed bank's assets. </TEXT></DOC>
