Using an admittedlysimplified criterion, it is argued that, for weak interplanar couplings,the critical 3d temperature is related to the multiplication of suchloops; it should be below the Kosterlitz and Thouless temperature wherenormal vortex loops, piercing the planes, would multiply in independentplanes.</TEXT></DOC>
