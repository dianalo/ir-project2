(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Evangelist Jimmy Swaggart, strugglingamid charges of sexual misconduct, said Sunday that his televisionministry lost $1.5 million in January and still needs an influx ofdonations to stay on the air.   Swaggart, who declared war on ``pornographers'' he said aretrying to destroy his ministry, said last week that he would be offthe air after Feb. 26 unless supporters provided enough money.   During his weekly TV program shown Sunday, Swaggart saidfollowers had responded to the plea but that more donations wereneeded to continue the broadcast to all areas.   ``On Feb. 26, if we do not continue to receive support, we willlose some stations,'' he said.   Although Swaggart did not reveal how much money had beenreceived, he said the ministry posted a $1.5 million loss inJanuary, a month he said is traditionally the worst month fortelevision evangelists.   Last month, Penthouse magazine quoted a New Orleans``strip-o-gram'' dancer as saying she posed nude for Swaggart, acharge that he labeled Sunday as ``a scam, a lie from A to Z.''   Catherine Mary Kampen's story is similar to that of a New Orleansprostitute who said Swaggart paid her to pose nude for him, anallegation that led to Swaggart's ouster from the Assemblies of Godand a sharp downturn in the fortunes of his ministry.   On Feb. 21, 1988, Swaggart made a tearful confession to anunspecified sin from the pulpit of his Baton Rouge church.   ``I am not discounting any sin or mistake that Jimmy Swaggart hascommitted or made,'' he said during Sunday's program. ``So, pleaseunderstand that. I have stood up as possibly no man in history hasever stood up and blamed no one but myself before the whole wideworld.''   ``But if Satan succeeds in getting you to zero in on that, andthat's all you see, then he will succeed,'' Swaggart said.   Swaggart repeated his charge that Penthouse published the storyeven though it had been given evidence that Kampen's story wasfalse. Penthouse has said it stands by the story. Swaggart'sattorneys have said a libel suit is being prepared.</TEXT></DOC>
