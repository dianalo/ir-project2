This methodology has thus become an important createsthe need for an accurate study of the various aspects of the phenomenon,e.g. technological, diagnostic and economic. In order to evaluate thequality of the CT scanners used in our country, the majors suppliersof the Italian market were asked to provide us with a unit from theirproduction. Six out of 7 companies complied with our request. A standardprotocol was used to evaluate the performance of 8 CT scanners, currentlyused in Italy. The following parameters were evaluated: spatial resolution,contrast resolution, noise, slice thickness, uniformity, linearity andradiation dose. Five currently-used operating modalities were employed.The results allow an overall assessment of the performance of the 8 CTscanners. 18 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
