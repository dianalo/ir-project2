The loss of revenue from business contracts with Iraq andKuwait, in addition to the rising price of oil, will cost Poland $2billion over the coming year, said Leszek Balcerowicz.   ``Poland has been very severely hit, at a very delicate time''of the reform program, he told reporters.   Iraq had been selling oil to Poland at cut-rate prices in returnfor a write-off of an estimated $600 million debt incurred duringthe eight-year Iran-Iraq war. Poland also sold Iraq largequantities of weapons, and Polish companies were engaged inconstruction projects for Iraq's post-war rehabilitation, officialssaid.   The Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait has stopped all that, and sentsome 1,000 Polish workers home.   The crash reform program initiated Jan. 1 by Poland's firstnon-communist government is designed to turn the centralizedeconomy into a market-driven capitalist system. Governmentsubsidies to businesses have been cut off, raising prices sharplyand forcing enterprises to become competitive or go bankrupt.   Resulting layoffs have driven unemployment to 5 percent, a levelunknown under the Communist Party which ruled Poland until lastyear.   Balcerowicz, who also serves as deputy prime minister, saidPoland's top priority was to trim its $40-billion debt, two-thirdsof which is owed to other governments and the rest to banks.   ``How can we convince people there's a light at the end of thetunnel with the growing debt overhang?'' he said.   But four days of talks with finance officials and bankersgathered here for the annual meeting of the World Bank andInternational Monetary Fund, he said, had failed to yield concreteresults.   ``There was considerable progress in understanding, but a lackof readiness to act,'' he said. ``Time is crucial.''   Poland is also facing the problem of having to pay with hardcurrency for much of its imports once its main trading partner, theSoviet Union, goes to a cash-only trade system based on realisticmarket values starting Jan. 1.   Balcerowicz said Poland was negotiating with the Soviets toensure there is no disruption in the gas pipeline supplies. TheSoviets have told Poland they will cut the supply from 8.2 billioncubic meters to 5.2 billion.   But Balcerowicz said he views this as ``an opening position'' innegotiations. ``We are insisting on maintaining the supply,'' hesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
