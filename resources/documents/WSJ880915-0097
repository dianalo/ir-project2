Andrews Jr., a physician and pulmonary specialist at the Lahey Clinic in Burlington, Mass., who did the study.    He blamed, among other things, chemicals used for fabricating and electroplating computer chips and chemicals used in soldering circuit boards in electronics plants. Workers' exposure to such substances can result in occupational asthma, bronchitis and other respiratory illnesses.    Because high-tech companies are assumed to be &quot;clean,&quot; Dr. Andrews said, there is often little concern about threats to health. &quot;There's some awareness of the problem, particularly among the workers themselves,&quot; Dr. Andrews added, &quot;but it's my impression that a lot of managers aren't aware of it.&quot;    Dr. Andrews's research covered a two-year period in which he treated 15 patients with job-related lung ailments who worked in high-tech industries in New England, including defense, electronics and plastics plants, as well as in computer and chip facilities. Some patients used portable equipment to monitor lung capacity before, during and after exposure to chemicals.    Dr. Andrews cited the example of an electrical engineer at a defense electronics plant in New Hampshire who complained of a cough, shortness of breath and a burning sensation in his chest -- but only while at work. Similar complaints were made by other workers at the plant, which produced circuit boards and optical lenses.    Investigators discovered that toxic gases emitted from the plant through exhaust pipes were inadvertently drawn back into the air-conditioning inlet ducts and recirculated through the plant.    In another case, a laboratory technician in a plastics research company complained of chest tightness and wheezing. The patient was eventually diagnosed as having occupational asthma, resulting from exposure to dust and fumes. A review of her employment history showed that, over 17 years, she had been exposed to 38 different chemicals: 28 powders and 10 solvents and fumes.    To fight such problems, Dr. Andrews said, companies can, among other steps, reduce toxic inhalants in the workplace, substitute less toxic chemicals in the manufacturing process, improve ventilation, require employees to wear masks or move affected employees to cleaner areas. </TEXT></DOC>
