The 22-count indictment announced Thursday against Salim B. Lewisand the brokerage he owns, S.B. Lewis andamp; Co., charged him withmanipulation and other frauds in connection with American Express'ssale of Fireman's Fund Corp. stock more than two years ago.   The indictment, which carries enormous potential penalties, is anindirect outgrowth of the Ivan Boesky insider trading scandal, andManhattan U.S. attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani said others might becharged.   Stanley Arkin, Lewis's attorney, said his client was innocent andwould fight the charges. Arkin harshly denounced Giuliani's officefor prosecuting the matter.   ``The allegations are totally off the wall,'' Arkin said.``Twenty-two counts of this piece of garbage reflect a kind ofmindless abusiveness of the people who brought this case. There's nopossible justification.''   He added: ``There's a great difference between being a toughprosecutor and being ruthless, and this over here is ruthlessness,completely unjustified on any basis.''   American Express was not named in the indictment, but wasportrayed as the intended beneficiary of the alleged manipulationscheme. The company quickly denied any wrongdoing and said it hasbeen cooperating fully with federal investigators.   Giuliani, whose office has been leading a crackdown on WallStreet corruption that has resulted in numerous indictments, toldreporters Lewis allegedly conspired with others to manipulate upwardthe stock price of Fireman's Fund, an insurance concern partly ownedby American Express.   The prosecutor said the manipulation took place when AmericanExpress was about to price an offering of Fireman's Fund stock itwished to sell. One of the objectives, Giuliani said, was ``to makesure that American Express maximized the proceeds that it receivedfrom that offering.''   He would not elaborate on whether anyone inside American Expressparticipated in the alleged scheme.   Lewis, 49, has a close working relationship with AmericanExpress, one of the nation's biggest financial services firms andparent of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., a leading Wall Streetinvestment house.   American Express retained Lewis to conduct major transactions inthe past, At the time of the alleged manipulation, it had asubstantial investment in S.B. Lewis and has about a 20 percentstake in the firm now.   The indictment alleged that Lewis requested two unidentifiedemployees of the Los Angeles-based brokerage firm Jefferies andamp; Co.buy more than 400,000 shares of Fireman's Fund on the New York andPacific stock exchanges on May 8, 1986, in attempt to drive itsprice up to $38 a share, substantially above its price at the time.   The indictment also accused Lewis of promising to reimburse theJefferies employees for any losses they might incur and of hidinghis role in the transactions through phony records.   The day after the alleged manipulation, American Express said itwould sell 8 million shares of Fireman's Fund at $41.50 a share. Iteventually realized a gain of $88 million from that sale.   Giuliani acknowledged that some information used to obtain theindictment was provided by Boyd L. Jefferies, the founder ofJefferies andamp; Co., who settled civil securities-law violations withthe Securities and Exchange Commission last year and has beencooperating with federal investigators.   Jefferies originally was implicated by Boesky, the most famousinsider trader in U.S. history. Now imprisoned, Boesky also has beencooperating with the government in other securities fraudinvestigations.   Lewis and his firm were charged with various counts ofconspiracy, stock manipulation, mail fraud, wire fraud, phony recordkeeping and margin violations. For an individual, each count carriesa maximum penalty of five years imprisonment. For a company, thepenalties range from $500,000 to $2.25 million per count.</TEXT></DOC>
