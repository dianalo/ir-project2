HibbsandM;San Diego, Calif.andM;No rose garden promisesandM;Dear Editor:andM;Your Sept. editorial, &quot;Facts and fictions,&quot; reflects a perception of theobject database market that is, unfortunately, all too common.andP;  Much of themarket is &quot;fueled by public relations and venture capital.&quot; Your claim thatobject databases are 90% promise and 10% reality&quot; may be statisticallycorrect if you factor in all the hype coming from companies that are not yetshipping products.andM;However, one vendor has established itself in this market without resortingto inflated claims or relying on venture capital.andP;  Founded in 1982, ServioCorp. has been shipping the GemStone object database management system formore than three years now, and we currently have an installed base of morethan 130 sites.andP;  Many of these customers are Fortune 500 companies developingmultiuser, object-oriented applications to solve mission-critical businessproblems.andM;Given the existence of a proven commercial product, you may be doing yourreaders a disservice when you tell them not to get excited about objectdatabases.andP;  This new technology really does provide a superior medium formany kinds of information.andP;  As your experience indicates, however, potentialbuyers should get excited about real, working products rather than promisesof things to come.andM;Thomas Atwood's article &quot;Applying the Object Paradigm to Databases&quot; (Sept.andO;1990), while highly informative, reflects a view of object databases that maybe slanted toward the engineering and scientific marketplace.andP;  This marketseems to be standardizing on C++ and UNIX, as Atwood suggests.andP;  Servio'sexperience in the larger commercial market, however, indicates thatcorporations want products that adapt to a variety of different languages andoperating systems.andM;The ideal object database would not be tied to a single-operating system butwould allow access from many languages, including not only C++ and Smalltalkbut Ada, Pascal, FORTRAN, COBOL, and other non-object-oriented languages.andO;The fact that GemStone provides this kind of flexibility today is irrelevantto that conclusion.andM;David A. TaylorandM;Alameda, Calif.andM;On a scale of one to 10andM;Dear Editor:andM;I appreciated Thomas Atwood's article &quot;Applying the Object Paradigm toDatabases&quot; (Sept.andP;  1990).andP;  But due to the mixture of terms describingrelational databases (tuples, relations, rows, records, and objects) andobject-oriented database management systems (OODBMs), I may have misread someof the information.andM;Atwood seemed intent on trashing relational, network, and hierarchical DBMSsat the expense of OODBMSs.andP;  Atwood's attitude mirrors the kind of behavior inwhich presidential candidates routinely indulge to contrast nebulous,ill-defined, and barely apparent differences.andP;  E. F. Codd enunciated anobject-oriented programming paradigm 30 years ago.andP;  Its commercialimplementation is a testament to Codd's vision, not a failure of therelational model.andM;Atwood points out that the relational model is row-oriented.andP;  In fact,relational database management systems  (RDBMSs) are set-oriented.andP;  Languagesdesigned to work with models such as SQL work on groups of records.andP;  Dealingwith one row at a time requires a special effort such as a host languageinterface to a lower-level language.andM;Atwood correlates support for C++ (or, presumably, any other object-orientedlanguage) with object databases.andP;  DBMSs and languages are like apples andoranges.andP;  Language choice has little to do with DBMS type.andM;The relational model supports schema names for traversing relationships, asin the advisor-advisee example.andP;  Level-1 and level-2 ANSI SQL imply separatebusiness rules for each direction.andP;  For instance, the rules delete advisor,then delete all advisees and create advisee requires advisor are part of theentity-relationship model, not data flows.andM;Codd's original rule 10 specified that business rules would be stored in theDBMS.andP;  They should not be the province of application programmers.andP;  Rule 10is just now finding expression in &quot;triggers&quot; in several SQL servers, and in asmaller way as part of ANSI level-2 SQL.andP;  One of the most complete relationalmodels is PACE (from Wang Labs), which puts referential integrity rules,inter-table formulas, virtual fields, and anything else you can imagine intoa centralized dictionary.andM;OODBMs may be something new, but I don't see a comprehensive grammar such asrelational algebra or set calculus.andP;  For programmers, object databases shouldbe treated as a natural extension of the relational paradigm, much as C,, isconsidered an expansion of the C model.andM;Arthur SulgerandM;Albany, N.Y.andM;C recognitionandM;Dear Editor:andM;I took note of the belligerent letters written by those who seem to wantC-oriented articles and magazines abolished, or a least driven underground(Feedback, Sept. 1990).andM;It would be ridiculous to think that articles on C have somehow displacedother material in the way disco temporarily pushed rock-and-roll off the air.andO;Many computer magazines with articles on other languages and magazines fornonprogrammers exist, and if Lotus magazine ever disappears from the racks,it won't be because of unfair competition from The C Users journal.andM;Daniel Kian McKiernanandM;Lake Oswego, Ore.andM;Color my worldandM;Dear Editor:andM;I read with interest Stan KellyBootle's &quot;Hills of cyan&quot; (June 1990).andP;  As aloyal WordStar user (since its CP/M days), however, I cannot accept what hesaid about version 4.0.andM;The choice for coloring italics (and almost all other attributes of thescreen) is not  fixed.&quot; True, to change it may not be as simple as Borland'sSprint, but it doesn't involve a &quot;drastic reinstallation procedure&quot; either.andO;By running WSCHANGE.COM, you can customize WordStar in almost everyconfiguration.andM;WSCHANGE would take Kelly-Bootle through a few menus, display (in color) allthe combinations, let him change them, save the configuration, and exit.andP;  Hecould even change the name of WS.COM, so there's a customized version foreveryone.andM;All in all, I agree that color is very important in user interfaces.andO;Programmers should include a way for users to customize their interfaces.andM;Bambang ParidjakaandM;Jakarta, IndonesiaandM;Welcome to red tapeandM;Dear Editor:andM;I agree with the attributes Karen Hooten ( &quot;Technical professionalresponsibilities,&quot; Apr. 1990) gives to professionalism.andP;  However,professionalism is a matter of attitude and maturity than formal education.andO;Unscrupulous people can behave unprofessionally no matter how many degreesthey have; conversely, many worthwhile programmers have become softwareengineers through hard work and experience.andM;To strangle creativity in a profession, require it to be licensed andoverseen by a government agency.andP;  Government licensing is the death knell ofinnovation and the beginning of a sea of red tape.andM;If you want a preview of what computing would be like in a regulated future,talk to programmers who work in large corporate or government bureaucracies.andO;It takes forever to get anything done, the results look like they weredesigned by committee (because they were), and the hardware and softwaretools are all chosen more for price than quality.andP;  Management has so manylayers that good ideas are diluted by the time they get approved, and if aproject goes sour nobody is clearly at fault.andP;  Welcome to computing,government-bureaucracy style.andM;J.C.andP;  WoodardandM;Tampa, Fla.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
