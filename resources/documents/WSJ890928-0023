Rebates are generally larger on the 1989 vehicles to help dealers clear out inventory as the new model year begins.    Beginning today, all buyers of the 1989 models covered by the program will be eligible for cash rebates ranging from $700 to $1,100 on the Calais and Ciera, $700 to $900 on Supreme, $200 to $1,000 on Eighty-Eight and Ninety-Eight and $2,500 on Toronado and Trofeo. Amounts vary according to the option packages buyers choose.    Buyers can select special finance rates in lieu of the rebates. Programs on the 1990 and 1989 models run indefinitely, Oldsmobile said. </TEXT></DOC>
