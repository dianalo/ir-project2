The permittedlevel of supplemental selenium that could be provided was increased from0.1 or 0.2 part per million (ppm) to 0.3 ppm in complete feed (except forweanling swine, which was already approved at 0.3 ppm), and from 1 milligram(mg) per head per day to 3 mg per head per day from salt-mineral mixturesand feed supplements for beef cattle.The 1987 amendments were issued in response to a food additive petition(FAP 2201) from the American Feed Industry Association (AFIA), 1701 NorthFort Myer Dr., Arlington, VA 22209. In issuing the 1987 amendments, FDAdetermined, based in part on an environmental impact analysis report (EIAR)submitted by AFIA, that they would not have a significant impact on thehuman environment. The agency made that determination in a document knownas a finding of no significant impact (FONSI). In April, May, and July 1987, the following organizations filed objectionsto the 1987 amendments:<ITAG tagnum="15">National Mixer-Feed Association (NMFA), P.O.

CVM has nearly completed its analysis of all the objections, which werebased on environmental and nonenvironmental concerns, and will soon recommendto the Commissioner of Food and Drugs (see 21 CFR 10.55) whether to grantor deny a hearing, in whole or in part, and whether to stay the 1987 amendments,also in whole or in part. Before making its recommendations, CVM wishesto obtain additional comments on certain environmental issues raised byone or more of the objections in connection with the EIAR or the FONSI.Accordingly, CVM is setting out a summary of, and its tentative responsesto, the objections in question and is providing interested persons an opportunityto submit written comments on these responses. CVM emphasizes that itsresponses are tentative; it has not reached a final conclusion on the meritsof any of the objections summarized below. <ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of the Five Objections and CVM's Tentative Responses</ITAG>1. NMFA, ACIL, MT, NRDC, and CHWA argue that the environmental impact ofthe 1987 amendments was not adequately addressed by the EIAR and the FONSI.According to one or more of these organizations, the literature demonstratesthat selenium bioconcentrates, bioaccumulates, and biomagnifies and thatselenium thereby creates environmental problems, particularly in aquaticecosystems.Bioconcentration is a process by which there is a net accumulation of achemical directly from water into aquatic organisms when uptake is greaterthan elimination. Bioaccumulation is a general term describing the combinedaccumulation of a chemical in aquatic organisms from water directly (bioconcentration)and through consumption of food containing the chemical. Biomagnificationis the increase in concentration of a bioaccumulated chemical which canresult when the chemical passes up through trophic levels of a food chainor web. The bioconcentration factor (BCF) is usually defined for an aquaticorganism as the concentration of a chemical in a tissue or whole organismdivided by the concentration of the chemical in the water in which theorganism lived. Bioaccumulation and, ordinarily, biomagnification of seleniummust occur in order for selenium to cause toxic effects in the environment.Bioconcentration, bioaccumulation, and biomagnification do not occur ifa compound is not bioavailable.Environmental introductions of selenium from naturally seleniferous areasand from certain industrial and agricultural activities can threaten thehealth of fish and wildlife, as NRDC and others point out (Refs. 1-6).Compared to natural sources of selenium, contributions of selenium fromindustrial activities are small (Ref. 1). Compared to the total contributionof selenium to the environment from industrial activities, the environmentalintroductions of selenium attributable to the 1987 amendments are small.None of the references or other materials submitted by any of the fiveorganizations identified in this notice discusses as a relevant environmentalfactor the addition of selenium to animal feeds and its consequent disposalvia animal wastes, even though selenium supplementation of animal feedshas occurred since at least 1973.CVM does not dispute that bioconcentration, bioaccumulation, and biomagnificationof some chemical forms of selenium can occur and that under the right circumstances,these forms can cause adverse environmental impacts, including fish mortalitiesand reproductive failures, waterfowl deaths, and severe deformities ofembryos and hatchlings. CVM also does not dispute that introductions ofselenium into the environment occur when domestic animals are fed seleniumsupplements, or that these introductions can occur via runoff from animalfarms and from agricultural soils to which manure from animals fed supplementalselenium has been applied. Finally, CVM does not dispute that aquatic ecosystemsare more sensitive than terrestrial ecosystems to selenium inputs.The issue, however, is whether the environmental introductions expectedto result from the 1987 amendments will be of adequate quantity and bioavailabilityto cause significant adverse environmental impacts, particularly in aquaticecosystems.The FONSI estimated that, on a local basis, the worst-case increase inconcentration (loading) of selenium in agricultural soils amended withmanure from animals receiving selenium supplementation would be about 2parts per billion (ppb) per application (typically once per year). (Asdiscussed in paragraph 3 of this notice, the FONSI's estimated maximumloading of selenium is a grossly exaggerated worst-case estimate.) TheFONSI then concluded that selenium loading would not have the potentialto cause significant environmental effects on a local scale. The followingis a reevaluation of this issue in light of the information submitted bythe organizations identified above as well as scientific information thathas become available since the FONSI was prepared.To address this issue, one must first understand the cycling of seleniumin the environment.The Selenium CycleSelenium cycles in the environment in what is called a biogeochemical cycle.The amount of selenium added to the cycle, the speed of the cycle, andthe balance of biological, chemical, and geological forces that mobilizeand immobilize various inorganic and organic forms of selenium, all determine,at a particular locality, the selenium content of the biota, water, air,and soil and whether it is toxic to members of the food web. Bioconcentrationfactors in the biota must be examined in light of the biogeochemical cyclefor selenium for these factors, as applied to selenium, to have any meaning.Lemly and Smith (Ref. 7) and Hodson (Ref. 8) provide a good overview ofselenium biogeochemical cycling in aquatic environments. These reviewssupport several conclusions or generalizations:a. The selenium status of an aquatic ecosystem cannot always be readilydetermined by measuring selenium concentration in water, because the seleniumbiogeochemical cycle works to minimuze the presence of selenium in solution.b. The quantities of selenium added to the ecosystem in question and thespeed at which selenium is cycling in the ecosystem are probably betterpredictors than worst-case modeling of the potential for adverse effectsto be seen in the biota.c. The chemical and biochemical processes that reduce the valence stateof selenium from +VI (selenate, SeO<T2>4</T2>=) to lower valence states +IV (selenite, SeO<T2>3</T2>=), O (elemental selenium, Seanddegrees;anddegrees;), and ^II (selenides,Se=), and the deposition of organic forms of selenium as detritus fromdead animals and plants, serve to isolate and reduce the bioavailabilityof selenium. d. The chemical and biological processes that oxidize selenium increasethe mobility and bioavailability of selenium.e. Selenium is bioaccumulated more efficiently by fish through the foodchain than through direct bioconcentration from water.f. The role of selenium as an essential micronutrient may play a part inits efficient bioaccumulation in food chains.g. Shallow, slow-moving bodies of water with large volumes of fine organicsediments, rooted aquatic plants, and active, large, benthic invertebratepopulations accumulate selenium most efficiently and, where accumulationsreach damaging levels, are probably among the slowest to recover afterselenium inputs cease.In some locations these factors coincide to cause selenium excesses inthe food web and toxic effects in higher trophic levels, e.g., predatoryfish and waterfowl (Ref. 9). In most locations in the United States, however,these factors, when combined with the constant removal of selenium fromthe land through harvest of agricultural crops, result in reduced availabilityof selenium forms in aquatic ecosystems. For example, Lowe, et al. (Ref.10) determined the trend in average selenium levels of freshwater fishsampled at more than 100 locations all over the continental United States.They found that the geometric mean of selenium levels in fish decreasedfrom 0.6 ppm (wet weight) in 1972, to 0.58 ppm in 1976-77, and 0.46 ppmin 1978-79. Lowe et al., found that this decreasing trend ceased in 1980-81,when the geometric mean of selenium levels in fish reached 0.47 ppm (470ppb).Selenium is converted from one chemical form to another in the environmentby the action of living organisms and chemical processes and moved throughoutthe environment by geological forces. Some selenium chemical forms arebioavailable and bioaccumulated by living organisms, some selenium formsare volatile and lost from the ecosystem, and others are not bioavailableand, therefore, are not toxic.Selenium GeologyBurau (Ref. 11) surveyed the geochemical factors affecting the range ofselenium concentrations found in soils. He states that, in most soils,higher concentrations of selenium in parent rocks and low rainfall favorthe formation of soils with high selenium contents. Magmatic rocks havethe lowest selenium content, ranging from 10 to 50 ppb. Sedimentary rocksare generally higher in selenium. Shales have the highest selenium contents,ranging from 500 to 28,000 ppb. Worldwide, the average selenium concentrationin soils is 400 ppb, but there is quite a range of concentrations represented.Some high selenium soils of the Great Plains, derived from Cretaceous-agePierre Shale, range from 6,000 to 28,000 ppb. Allaway's analysis (Ref.12) of the selenium biogeochemical cycle concluded that, in acid to neutralsoils, the pool of bioavailable selenium will eventually be depleted.Most cropland in the United States does not have a sufficient pool of bioavailableselenium to grow feed grains containing sufficient selenium for the nutritionalneeds of domestic animals. This is the situation that created the needfor selenium supplementation of feeds in the first place. Without suchsupplementation, domestic livestock raised in selenium-deficient areas,and which therefore receive selenium-deficient diets, often exhibit nutritionalmyopathies and reproductive problems that can lead to death.Selenium Retention and Excretion by Selenium Supplemented AnimalsThe chemical form in which selenium is excreted by farm animals receivingselenium supplements has much to do with its bioavailability and its mobilityin the environment, once that waste is amended into agricultural soils.Selenium bioavailability, retention, and the chemical form of seleniumexcreted by domestic animals are affected by the nutrient level, the seleniumcompound fed, the feed matrix, and the age and metabolic status of theanimal.Nonruminants (e.g., poultry, swine, rodents, humans) readily absorb sodiumselenate and selenite after consumption. Most of the selenium consumedby nonruminants is excreted in the urine. Studies with rats have shownthat, even with increasing levels of selenium supplementation (as sodiumselenite), only a small and constant fraction of selenium is excreted fecallyand the rest is excreted in the urine (Ref. 13). Chemical analysis of theselenium component of the urine of rats supplemented with sodium selenatefound 21 percent excreted as inorganic selenium, 26 percent excreted astrimethylselenonium ion, and 21 percent as an unidentified compound (Ref.14). Depending on the form of selenium supplementation, 20 to 50 percentof the urinary excretion of selenium is excreted in the form of the trimethylselenoniumion (Ref. 14). Olson and co-workers (Ref. 15) have shown that trimethylselenoniumis minimally available for plant uptake, and that which is absorbed isnot biologically active. (See also Ref. 12.) They determined, moreover,that FDA's regulation permitting the supplementation of 0.1 ppm seleniumin animal diets did not affect the selenium status of selenium deficientand borderline agronomic areas (Ref. 15). This work suggests that seleniumsupplementation would not be detrimental to borderline toxic areas, inthe unlikely event that food producers in such areas chose to provide suchsupplementation to their livestock. (See paragraph 5 of this notice.)A large proportion of the selenium in selenium supplemented animals isnot excreted but is retained by the growing animal. Young swine supplementedwith 0.3 ppm selenium in their diets retained 44 percent of the selenium(Ref. 16). Swine fed 0.3 ppm sodium selenite absorbed 88 percent of thesupplemented selenium and retained 50 percent of the absorbed levels (Ref.17). Due to the anatomy of the bird, retention (digestibility) studiesare not routine. In a calculation using the selenium deposited in the muscle,organs, and blood of an adult broiler as indication of overall retention,a very conservative estimate of 18 percent of the supplemented selenium(when selenium was supplemented at 0.3 ppm of the diet) may be interpolated,with values ranging from 78.3 to 13.2 percent retention in diets containing0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 ppm supplemental selenium (Ref. 18). Ruminants (e.g., cattle and sheep) metabolize and excrete selenium differentlyfrom nonruminants. In contrast with the urinary excretion seen in nonruminants,ruminants excrete the majority of their selenium in the feces (Ref. 19).Experiments with fecal selenium have demonstrated that most of the seleniumis not water soluble, and other solubility mediums suggest that the primaryexcretory product is elemental selenium (Seanddegrees;) (Ref. 12). That elementalselenium is formed is supported by the fact that the rumen is known tobe conducive to reduction of compounds due to its anaerobic and highlyreductive environment (Ref. 19). In a study in which sheep were fed radiolabeled organically bound selenium,more than 50 percent of the selenium dose was excreted in the feces andless than 7 percent of the dose was excreted in the urine (Ref. 20). Ofthe labeled fecal selenium, only 0.3 percent could be found in forage speciesgrown on feces-amended soils, suggesting that fecally excreted seleniumfrom ruminants is not significantly available to plants (Ref. 20). In astudy in which radiolabeled selenium (as selenious acid, Se +IV) was fedto sheep, 51 percent of the dose was found in the feces, and this seleniumwas mostly unavailable to rye grass (Ref. 21). Studies have shown thatelemental selenium has only 7.4 percent of the biological availabilityof sodium selenite (Se Se +IV) to young chickens (Ref. 22). In summary, oxidized, bioavailable forms of selenium (selenite and selenate,valence states +IV and +VI, respectively) are used to supplement the dietsof domestic livestock. These forms are readily absorbed, partially retainedby the growing animal as an essential micronutrient, and partially excreted.Nonruminants excrete a mixture of selenium compounds, a large proportionof which is the organic selenium compound trimethylselenonium. Ruminantsexcrete reduced forms of selenium, a large portion of which is elementalselenium. These excreted compounds have much reduced bioavailability and,hence, little potential for bioaccumulation and biomagnification, as evidencedby the poor uptake of these compounds by plants. Introductions of Selenium Into the Environment The contribution to the total amount of selenium in the environment dueto the 1987 amendments is minimal, at best. Nationwide, 46,000 metric tonsof selenium are introduced each year from fossil fuel combustion, industriallosses, and municipal wastes (FONSI, p. 3 and references cited there),and 11,000 and 31,000 metric tons per year are introduced from air emissionsand solid waste disposal, respectively (id.). By contrast, on a ``worst-casebasis,'' selenium introductions due to the 1987 amendments are estimatedto reach 22.4 metric tons per year, assuming that all animals are supplementedat the maximum permitted levels (id. at 4.). One expert estimates thatno more than 10 metric tons per year of selenium are used in animal feedsand veterinary medicine (Ref. 23). As discussed above, only one-half totwo-thirds of this amount would be introduced into the environment frommanure from selenium-supplemented animals; the rest would be retained inthe tissues of the animals. It should also be noted that the FONSI's worst-case estimates of seleniumloadings from waste applications are extremely conservative (see paragraph3 of this notice), and that the contribution of selenium to the agriculturalsystem from animal waste will probably be lost in the much larger poolof selenium already naturally present in most soils. Fate of Excreted Selenium in the Environment The selenium excreted by farm animals will mostly be incorporated intoagricultural soils when the manure from these animals is used as fertilizerfor crops. After incorporation into soils, the selenium will be subjectto the chemical, biological, and geological forces that convert one formof selenium to another. Some of the selenium may be released as volatile organic forms of selenium,from plants and through the action of the microbial communities presentin the soil and sediment (Ref. 24). The amount of selenium lost throughthese means will vary with the plant species present and the activity ofthe soil community. Some of the selenium will enter the terrestrial-based food chain in herbivorousinsects, in birds eating both crops and insects, in grazing animals, andin man. Some of the selenium will be bioaccumulated by the crops grown on the amendedsoil, and a portion of this bioaccumulated selenium will be removed atharvest. The quantity bioaccumulated and removed will depend on the formsof selenium introduced, the activities of soil microbial populations, thesoil type, the climate, the weather, the ability of the crop plant to accumulateselenium, and the portions of the crop plant harvested. Some of the selenium will be present in runoff from the amended soil. Theamount will depend on the forms of selenium present, the ability of thesoil community to convert them to more soluble forms, the quantity andfrequency of rainfall, the topography of the land, and the type of groundcover and soil. Selenium present in runoff may be either in solution orabsorbed to particulate clays or organic matter. The forms of selenium excreted by animals are not readily bioavailableto plants, and in acid to neutral soils these forms become progressivelymore bound into ferric hydroxide selenite and metal selenide complexes,which are also not bioavailable. Although some forms of excreted seleniumcan be oxidized to selenates in alkaline, well-aerated soils, this processis characterized by Allaway as a slow reaction, and other excreted seleniumforms are considered as a ``sink,'' or loss, from the cycle (Ref. 12).In summary, FDA considered selenium bioconcentration, bioaccumulation,and biomagnification when the FONSI was prepared in 1986. CVM has consideredthese issues again in light of subsequently available research. The environmentalintroduction and fate modeling conducted in the FONSI are crude, perhaps,but are also extremely conservative. CVM believes that the modeling isconservative enough to account for the uncertainties and local variationsinvolved in an environmental fate and effects of the selenium introducedinto the environment as a result of the 1987 amendments. CVM has tentativelyconcluded that further environmental assessment of these phenomena is neitherrequired nor necessary here, where the contribution of selenium from animalwaste due to the 1987 amendments, compared to the total amount of seleniumin the environment, is so small and the selenium contributed is in a formthat is not initially bioavailble, and may only slowly become partiallybioavailable. Selenium must be in a bioavailable form in order to bioaccumulate.2. MT argues that the FONSI referred only to bioaccumulation in animalsand failed to consider bioaccumulation in plants, insects, and microbiota.As explained in paragraph 1 of this notice, the FONSI cites pertinent literatureconcerning selenium bioconcentration, bioaccumulation, and biomagnification.In that context, the term ``organisms'' includes plants, microbes, andanimals, including insects. To the extent that MT's argument is relatedto the comments summarized in paragraph 1 of this notice, CVM's tentativeconclusion there also applies here. 3. NRDC argues that the environmental fate model in the FONSI is unrealistic,and proffers two allegedly improved models. NRDC's models include increasesin the watershed area with and without manure stockpiled in that area.As a result of these claimed improvements over the environmental fate modelin the FONSI, NRDC calculates that there would be a 5- to 10-fold greaterconcentration of selenium in the 1-hectare pond featured in that modelthan the FONSI estimates. NRDC then compares its estimates with backgroundlevels of selenium in freshwater lakes and rivers, concludes that the formerare equal to or greater than the latter, and argues that this additionalburden can contribute to harmful effects of selenium on the biota. Employing a worst-case analysis and using extremely conservative assumptions,the FONSI (p. 9) estimates that, as a result of the 1987 amendments, therewill be an influx of 0.02 to 0.24 ppb/year selenium into the modeled 1-hectarepond, which already contains approximately 0.2 ppb selenium (Ref. 11).On a long-term basis, concentrations of selenium in water ranging from2 to 5 pb should not be harmful (Refs. 3 and 7); indeed, they should provideprotection for all freshwater life, since there is no indication in theliterature of any deleterious effects of selenium on any aquatic organismat those concentrations (Ref. 3). Moreover, according to the EnvironmentalProtection Agency (Ref. 25), freshwater aquatic organisms and their usesshould not be affected unacceptably if the 4-day average concentrationof selenium does not exceed 5 ppb more than once every 3 years and if the1-hour average concentration does not exceed 20 ppb more than once every3 years. CVM has tentatively concluded that, in all likelihood, the influx of seleniuminto local aquatic environments as a result of the 1987 amendments willnot begin to approach even 0.02 ppb/year, even if NRDC's allegedly improvedenvironmental fate models are employed. That is because the unstated assumptionsunderlying the FONSI are extremely conservative. The FONSI assumes that none of the supplemented selenium will stay in thetissues of the growing food-producing animals receiving supplemented feeds,i.e., that all the supplemented selenium will be excreted directly intothe animals' waste and then onto the soil. In fact, selenium at nutritionallevels given to growing animals is readily absorbed and is substantiallyretained in their tissues, as discussed in paragraph 1 of this notice.The FONSI also assumes that the excreted selenium will be in a chemicalform that is readily soluble in water, i.e., selenate. In fact, seleniumexcreted by domestic animals is primarily in chemical forms_elemental selenium,selenides, and trimethylselenonium_that have low solubility in water, poormobility through soils, low bioavailability, and low toxicity, as discussedin paragraph 1 of this notice. (See also Refs. 1, 26, and 27.) Additionally, the FONSI assumes that maximum amounts of selenium will beused in feeds, mineral mixes, and feed supplements, even though it is unlikelythat selenium supplementation will be provided in geographical areas ofthe country that are selenium sufficient (paragraph 5 of this notice).Next, the FONSI assumes that up to 10 percent of the selenium in the waste-amendedsoil will be lost to runoff from a single, large rainfall event. But soil-incorporatedpesticides show losses to runoff of no more than 0.5 to 1.5 percent (FONSI,p. 9 and reference cited there), and selenium incorporated into the top6 inches of the soil should not show greater losses to runoff, given therelatively insoluble chemical forms of selenium excreted by supplementedanimals. Finally, the FONSI assumes that the runoff from the large rainfall eventwill constitute 20 percent of all the water in the pond. That figure ishigh as a proportion of the water one would expect to find in the 1-hectarefarm pond and, to an even greater extent, as a proportion of the highervolumes of water normally present in rivers and lakes. NRDC does not dispute these conservative assumptions. Instead, it replacesthe 10-hectare watershed used in the environmental fate model in the FONSIwith runoff from a 50-hectare watershed and with runoff from a 50-hectarewatershed augmented by an equivalent amount of runoff from manure pilesand other unsecured waste stored in that watershed. According to NRDC,use of its environmental fate model would result in 5- and 10-fold increases,respectively, in the concentrations of selenium one would expect in the1-hectare pond after receiving this runoff. CVM believes that NRDC's models contain mathematical errors (Ref. 28) andare based on unrealistic assumptions. It also believes that even if theassumptions are regarded as true (with or without the mathematical errorscorrected), the models would not result in concentrations of selenium ofenvironmental concern. Use of NRDC's model employing runoff from a 50-hectare watershed resultsin a 2.75-fold increase over the FONSI's maximum estimate of 0.24 ppb/yearinflux of selenium into local aquatic environments, to a maximum of 0.67ppb; use of NRDC's model employing runoff from a 50-hectare watershed augmentedby an equivalent amount of runoff from unsecured manure piles results ina 5.5-fold increase, to a maximum of 1.3 ppb (Ref. 28). Taking NRDC's calculationsfor the latter model as true results in 10-fold increase, to a maximumof 2.4 ppb. Only the last of these concentrations (2.4 ppb) of selenium would exceedthe concentrations of selenium at which there is any evidence of deleteriouseffects on aquatic organisms. And that concentration is based on a mathematicalerror (Ref. 28) and is derived from the FONSI's maximum estimate (0.24ppb), which incorporates a series of extremely conservative assumptions.Moreover, the assumptions underlying NRDC's environmental fate models arewholly unrealistic. They assume, for example, that all 50 hectares of thewatershed are in plowed farmland, that all of them are amended with themaximum amount of poultry waste, and that all the runoff from the entirewatershed drains into the 1-hectare pond. NRDC's second model assumes,in addition, that an equal amount of poultry waste, piled up and otherwiseunsecured, will be located on the same farmland and that the rainfall eventwill similarly leach the selenium from such storage areas into the pond.Such ``double counting'' is especially unrealistic with respect to poultrywaste. The vast majority of poultry are raised in covered buildings orenclosures that do not allow much, if any, of the poultry waste to be touchedby rainfall; poultry waste is often not removed from the buildings forup to 2 years; and poultry waste is a valuable soil conditioner and, assuch, is spread over and incorporated into agricultural lands. 4. NRDC argues that the FONSI fails to assess the potential effects ofthe 1987 amendments on wildlife living near acquatic environments, andclaims that it should have taken into account food-chain BCF's. NRDC citesa range of BCF's from 460 to 32,000, on the ground that they may vary forvarious acquatic species. It then applies 3 BCF's (500, 5,000 and 30,000)to the environmental fate models discussed in paragraph 3 of this notice.Using the various BCF's and models, NRDC estimates that aquatic speciesmay accumulate 120 to 72,000 ppb selenium. NRDC suggests that dietary seleniumlevels above 5,000 ppb may be harmful to migratory birds. As discussed in paragraph 1 of this notice, bioconcentration and biomagnificationmust be considered within the context of the selenium biogeochemical cycle,including the loading or quantity of selenium introduced into the systemand the factors that mobilize and immobilize selenium in the environment.CVM has re-examined the model used in the FONSI, which attempts to evaluateselenium inputs and the potential environmental effects on a pond receivingrunoff from land amended with wastes from animals receiving selenium supplementation.If one assumes that the worst-case losses of selenium from the amendedagricultural soils are in the form of water soluble, bioavailable selenate,then the addition of less than 10 grams of selenate to a shallow, 1-hectarepond all at once could result in an undesirable level of food chain biomagnificationand adverse effects due to selenium toxicity on the top trophic levels.As discussed in paragraph 1 of this notice, however, animals do not excreteselenium in the form of selenate, but, rather, in reduced forms with limitedor no bioavailability, low toxicity, and very limited mobility throughsoil. Furthermore, where environmental conditions favor the transformationof some of the excreted forms into selenates, this can occur only slowly(Ref. 12). CVM now believes that the FONSI grossly overestimates the potential mobilityand bioavailability, and, therefore, the potential for environmental impact,of selenium entering the environment as a consequence of the 1987 amendments.5. MT argues that environmental problems caused by selenium are not limitedto California, but are widespread in the United States. As the FONSI (pp. 11-12) acknowledges, a few sites in the United Stateshave been contaminated with high concentrations of selenium and some fishand wildlife from those sites have been adversely affected. These sitesinclude, in addition to the Kesterson Reservoir, sites contaminated inNorth Carolina and Texas due to coal-fired power plants. Kesterson is thefirst documented problem area created by a combination of high levels ofnaturally occurring selenium in the soil and the leaching of high levelsof selenium by irrigation return water by agricultural practices (Ref.29). That problem area, however, does not extend very far. The Volta WildlifeArea, which is only 6 miles from Kesterson and which is used as the controlsite for most chemical and biological comparison with Kesterson, is notaffected (Ref. 30). And fish sampled from a variety of locations in thenearby San Joaquin River had concentrations of selenium within the rangearound the national average (approximately 0.5 ppm wet weight (Ref. 10))to 5 ppm dry weight (equivalent to some 1 ppm wet weight) (Ref. 31)). Moreto the point, CVM is unaware of any evidence that more than a handful ofaquatic environments in the United States are contaminated with high concentrationsof selenium, and CVM does not believe that food producers in those areaswill choose to provide supplemental selenium to their livestock. (The 1987amendments, after all, permit but do not require, selenium supplementation.)Such supplementation is not inexpensive. Food producers are unlikely toprovide it unless the animals are in selenium-deficient areas. <ITAG tagnum="84">References</ITAG>The following references, together with the other documents cited in thisnotice, and any comments received have been placed on display in the DocketsManagement Branch (address above) and may be seen by interested personsbetween 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. Monday through Friday. <ITAG tagnum="21">1.
