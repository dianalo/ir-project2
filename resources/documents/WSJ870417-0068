Birnbaum and Alan Murray, to be published by Random House in June.}    Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski was shocked at the Democratic National Convention in 1984 as he listened to presidential nominee Walter Mondale.    &quot;Let's tell the truth,&quot; Mr. Mondale said during his acceptance speech. &quot;Mr. Reagan will raise taxes, and so will I. He won't tell you. I just did.&quot;    Afterward, Rep. Rostenkowski (D., Ill.) says he whispered to the candidate that he had a lot of courage. And Mr. Mondale whispered back, according to Rep. Rostenkowski: &quot;Look at 'em, we're going to tax their ass off.&quot;    The brief exchange -- which Mr. Mondale says he doesn't recall -- underscores a fundamental struggle within the Democratic Party that still rages today. Convinced that the budget deficit was the nation's No. 1 problem, Mr. Mondale rejected those who urged him to endorse the tax-overhaul plan drawn up by Sen. Bill Bradley (D., N.J.) and Rep. Richard Gephardt (D., Mo.). Their plan, he complained, did nothing to cut the deficit. Instead he backed a tax increase, and that decision helped ensure his defeat.    A few months later, Chairman Rostenkowski led his party in an about-face. He abandoned his insistence on deficit reduction and chose instead to join President Reagan in an unusual bipartisan plea for tax overhaul. His decision, made against the advice of many of his closest friends and advisers, cleared the way for the most sweeping overhaul of the tax system in the nation's history.    Disputes over how to approach the issue of taxes continue to split the Democratic Party. House Majority Leader Jim Wright of Texas is following in Mr. Mondale's footsteps, calling for a major tax increase to cut the deficit. Others, including Mr. Rostenkowski, continue to pursue a more cautious path, wary of the wrath that the voters may shower on anyone who increases their taxes so soon after the tax code's overhaul. That debate is certain to be a theme in the 1988 presidential campaign.    A new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows that the public, much like Democratic politicians, is about evenly split on the question of taxes. Asked whether they favored raising the federal excise tax &quot;on such items as cigarettes, beer and gasoline&quot; to help reduce the budget deficit, 45% of those responding thought it was a good idea, 48% thought it was a bad idea and 7% were unsure.    Rep. Rostenkowski's decision to join the president in pursuit of tax overhaul effectively killed any push for tax increases in the last Congress. Here is the story behind the chairman's decision.    ---   In mid-May of 1985, House Speaker Thomas &quot;Tip&quot; O'Neill (D., Mass.) telephoned Chairman Rostenkowski to ask whether he would deliver the Democratic response to the president, who was scheduled to go on national television the next week to promote tax overhaul.    &quot;Not really, necessarily,&quot; Rep. Rostenkowski grumbled in reply, and the answer was natural enough. The often scowling, gruff-voiced chairman of the Ways and Means Committee wasn't exactly telegenic. He was big, brash and bellowing -- a door slammer and, at times, a bully. He was reared as the kind of beef-eating, ward-heeling machine politician who considered the blow-dried world of TV to be sissy stuff.    Okay, said Speaker O'Neill. The Democrats in the Senate were eager to put their own man up for the job. If Rep. Rostenkowski didn't want it, a senator would be happy to make the televised response.    &quot;Whaddya mean?&quot; the Chicagoan shot back. The mere thought of some self-important senator stealing the limelight got his back up. He felt that he was the Democrats' No. 1 man on taxes. If anyone was going to talk about tax revision, it shouldn't be a member of the Senate; it should be Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of Ways and Means.    In a fit of pique and pride, he consented to put the nation on notice that he and the Democratic Party were reformers too. The prime-time display of bipartisan cooperation on the issue would symbolize a new political reality; with the support of the top Democratic tax-writer as well as the Republican president, tax overhaul had a chance.    The speech was scheduled for Tuesday, May 28, and Rep. Rostenkowski and his staff took the task of preparation very seriously. They knew the risks were high, and the odds against them were great. Tax overhaul was still a tough issue, with little support yet among the public or members of Congress. On top of that, the history of Democratic responses to Reagan addresses was abysmal. Many of the previous replies failed to stir public sentiment, largely because they attacked the president, who was enormously popular. Pitting mere politicians against &quot;The Great Communicator&quot; inevitably was a mismatch.    So Rep. Rostenkowski took a different tack. Instead of picking a fight, he decided to embrace both Mr. Reagan and tax overhaul. It would be a partisan speech, blaming the Republicans for making a mess out of the tax system; but it also would position the Democrats as allies of the president in the battle against the special interests.    Many of Rep. Rostenkowski's friends had urged him to be cautious in response to the president's call for overhaul. The president is just bluffing, laying a trap, they told him.    But Chairman Rostenkowski didn't believe he had the luxury to say &quot;no.&quot; He thought he had to defend what he regularly called, &quot;the biggest plank in the Democratic platform&quot; -- tax reform. &quot;I thought Ronald Reagan was trying to outpolitic us,&quot; Rep. Rostenkowski said. &quot;I'm not a reformer. But I'm a Democrat. And if the Democrats are for reform, then I'm a reformer.&quot;    President Reagan, the chairman told his speechwriter, John Sherman, &quot;talks in simple language that people understand. He gets on the couch in the living room of every person that watches. I want to get on that couch with him. I want to say to the people, put my arm around 'em and say, 'Our president wants what's great and best for you -- and so do I.'&quot;    In his address to the nation, Ronald Reagan labeled tax overhaul &quot;a second American revolution.&quot; Then it was the chairman's turn. Near the end of his speech, Rep. Rostenkowski asked the audience to send letters of support, and he uttered the words that would become the symbol of his effort to overhaul the tax system: &quot;Even if you can't spell Rostenkowski, put down what they used to call my father and grandfather -- Rosty.&quot; He pronounced it &quot;Rusty,&quot; the way his childhood friends used to. &quot;Just address it to R-O-S-T-Y, Washington, D.C. The Post Office will get it to me. Better yet, write your representative and your senator. And stand up for fairness and lower taxes.&quot;    When the speech was over, the camera crew broke into applause. Then came a telephone call from the White House. It was Chief of Staff Donald Regan calling to congratulate Rep. Rostenkowski on his speech, and to pass along a comment from the president. &quot;Jesus,&quot; Mr. Regan quoted the president as saying, &quot;He's got me with Truman and Kennedy&quot; favoring tax reform. &quot;Does he know I'm in the Roosevelt room watching his response?&quot;    More than 75,000 people responded to Rep. Rostenkowski's plea to write &quot;Rosty, Washington, D.C.&quot; One person sent a wooden two-by-four beam to help the chairman beat back the special interests. Another envelope contained a yards-long, computer-generated banner that read, &quot;My parents need tax reform.&quot;    ---   From &quot;Showdown at Gucci Gulch: Lawmakers, Lobbyists and the Unlikely Triumph of Tax Reform,&quot; Copyright 1987 by Jeffrey H.
