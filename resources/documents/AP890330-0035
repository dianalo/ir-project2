Complaints surfaced in the Soviet press today following theannouncement Monday that Tokyo Broadcasting System signed anon-governmental deal with Glavkosmos, the Soviet civilian spaceagency, to send a reporter to Mir in 1991 as part of its 40thbirthday celebration.   The Japanese television company plans to pay $11.3 million forthe space flight, Komsomolskaya Pravda, the Communist Youth Leaguenewspaper, reported.   ``How could this happen in the country that produced Gagarin andTereshkova?'' columnist Yaroslav Golovanov wrote in the paper,referring to Yuri Gagarin and Valentina Tereshkova, the first manand woman in space.   ``Isn't it clear that such a deal rading for our civic dignity?Don't our high-placed `cosmic merchants' understand that?'' Goloothe Soviet government to annul the ``brazen contract.''   da columnist A. Tarasov commentet was easy to guess why, whenGlavkosmos was deciding on its findifferently over the Sovietpress.''   ``Alas, alas, we all ur pay in ordinary Soviet rublesn`t pay forthe flight in the convertible currency which Glavkodly,'' he wrote.   In a related development this week, the Swiss advertising agencyPunto S.A. announced thaigned a deal with the Soviets to selladvertising space on Soviet spaceships, launch pads and osmonautuniforms.   The main exposure would be on the ground launches, which theSoviets have indicated they want to open increasingly to Western TVcrews. A prime ``billboard'' also would be the Mir, which has spacefor two company or product logos, said the company's Andrea Caprasaid.   The Soviets set up Glavkosmos in 1985 to supervise theircivilian space program and enter the world of commercial satellitelaunching. The program has been hampered by Western restrictions onort of high technology.   Writing in today's Komsomolskaya Pravda, Pyotr Polozhevetzpointed out about Mir that the Japanese ``simply bought a ticketfor aight. It's a ticket that right now we can't afford.''   The Soviet Union will be better off taking money from theJapanese and spending its own resources on meat, clothes andschools, he wrote.   The flight is expected to last almost eight days.   The Tokyo Broadcast System has begun a selects among almost 40of its reporters, and plans to put two finalitwo-year Soviettraining course, deciding only at the last minute which one willactually make trip, Komsomolskaya Pravda reported.</TEXT></DOC>
