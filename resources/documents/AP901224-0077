Maya, an Asian elephant who was the oldest mammal at the zoo,apparently suffered torn ligaments in her legs Sunday as she triedto climb out of the moat surrounding her enclosure, said zoospokesman Jeff Jouett.   Veterinarians resorted to a fatal dose of sedative when Maya wasunable to stand on her own following a treatment of fluids,painkillers and steroids.   ``I counted 27 people there trying to help,'' Jouett said.``When she would try to rock and stand up, there was a lot ofcalling and urging to her.''   Elephants cannot convalesce while sitting or lying down becausetheir weight exerts life-threatening pressure on their lungs,Jouett said.   Jouett said 51 is fairly elderly for an elephant, but they havebeen known to live into their 60s in captivity.   Maya, who was captured in India and brought to the zoo Nov. 8,1941, was bumped into the moat by another elephant. Two nearbykeepers didn't see the fall but heard the commotion.   The 7,100-pound elephant was walking without difficulty in themoat, but she apparently crippled herself while trying to climb outon bales of hay that zookeepers set up like steps, Jouett said.   Maya then was fitted with a harness and lifted by crane into asitting position. But it was evident when workers tried to get herto stand that her legs wouldn't support her, and she was then putto death.   Elephants have been knocked into the moat before withoutsuffering serious injury, but Jouett said Maya's age may have madeher accident worse. Tests after her death showed she suffered fromdegenerative arthritis in her legs.   He described her as a generally calm, easygoing creature, butone who often would assert herself to show she still led the herd.   ``There's some concern over how the remaining four elephantswill react,'' Jouett said. ``They'll notice she's gone and I'm sureit will be upsetting to them.''   After the accident, the zoo's Elephant Mesa was closed to thepublic for the rest of the day.</TEXT></DOC>
