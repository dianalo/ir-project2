Strike committee chairman Alojzy Szablewski emerged from threehours of talks Saturday evening smiling broadly and calling thenegotiations ``a big step forward.''   According to witnesses, he told the strikers that management inprinciple accepted the committee's demands to increase pay at least$38 a month, reinstate fired Solidarity activists and grant amnestyfor the approximately 1,000 strikers occupying the plant.   Three deputy directors of the shipyard taking part in the talksrefused to discuss demands for legalization of a Solidarity localat the shipyard and freedom for political prisoners, saying thoseissues were outside their competence, Szablewski said.   A 15-minute audio broadcast by Solidarity, the illegal tradefederation, broke into the communist government's television newsat 9:30 p.m. in Gdansk. Solidarity founder Lech Walesa could beheard telling strikers: ``You are to decide whether we accept orfight for Solidarity. It's your decision. In the case of apacification (raid), I'll be the last to leave the shipyard.''   The speech was taped at a rally in the shipyard after the talksand broadcast a short time later, Solidarity sources said.   Management already had expressed willingness in talks with theofficial union to raise wages by about $38 a month, but it is thefirst time management has engaged in talks with the unofficialstrike committee and, according to the sources, made the promisedirectly to the strikers.   The state-run news agency PAP filed a report saying no agreementwas reached but that talks were to continue Sunday.   It said the shipyard was planning to raise pay by an unspecifiedamount June 1 and quoted a prosecutor as saying strikers who giveup peacefully would not be arrested and that management saidstrikers would not be fired.   The PAP account made no mention of agreement to reinstateSolidarity activists.   Polish-born Pope John Paul II, on a visit of South America, saidSaturday that his countrymen are justified in striking. He said theheart of Poland's crisis is ``the lack of true democracy.''   Representatives of the Roman Catholic Church mediated the talksat the shipyard's main office building, sources said.   Walesa did not participate in the talks.   Piotr Konopka, an aide to Walesa, said the meeting was importantbecause it meant the authorities had recognized that the strikecommittee represented shipyard workers.   Saturday's meeting was the first of its kind since the shipyardstrike began Monday in two weeks of labor upheaval that has beenthe worst in Poland since the 1981 military crackdown.   Riot police surrounded the yard Thursday, prompting fears thatthey would storm the shipyard like they did the Nowa Huta steelmill in Krakow on Thursday.   Those fears diminished on Saturday, according to a strikers'communique issued from the shipyard.   ``The shipyard is still isolated from the city, but there is nofeeling of siege,'' the communique said.   Bishop Tadeusz Goclowski of Gdansk, who was instrumental inarranging the talks, said he was ``convinced that a solutionwithout use of force is possible.''   Indeed, Konopka said the chief of security forces for Gdansk,internal affairs Gen. Jerzy Andrzejewski, had guaranteed thestrikers' safety for the time being.   In addition, a church source in Warsaw said the church hadreceived a promise that the strikers remaining in the shipyard, whohave not received food supplies since Thursday, would get food.There also were attempts under way to allow strikers to see theirfamilies.   Inside the shipyard, ``The atmosphere is very good ... They feelthey are on a piece of free Polish land,'' Konopka said.   Adam Michnik, a senior opposition activist, said the talksproved ``the road of dialogue is possible.''   Earlier, Michnik had said he believed Polish authorities wouldforce the strike to end by starving the workers.   Solidarity contends the trade federation, outlawed following theDecember 1981 martial law crackdown, should be legalized andallowed to join in a dialogue to solve Poland's pressing economicand social problems.   Also on Saturday, two Solidarity members were sentenced to jailfor union activities.   Solidarity national spokesman Janusz Onyszkiewicz was sentencedto six weeks in prison in connection with interviews he gave toWestern media.   Onyszkiewicz was sentenced in Warsaw on a charge ofdisseminating false information aimed at sparking arrest. InGdansk, Czeslaw Nowak, a Solidarity dockworker activist, wassentenced to three months.   The sentences followed Friday's sentencing of Bogdan Lis,regional head of Solidarity for Gdansk, to three months in prison.They were the harshest imposed on Solidarity members for unionactivities since a 1986 political amnesty.   Official pressure on Solidarity has stepped up since a wave ofat least five strikes hit the country beginning April 25.   Besides the Lenin shipyard strike, there was a 10-day strike bysteelworkers in southern Poland, one-day bus driver strikes inBydgoszcz and Szczecin and a two-day strike by workers at the heavymachinery plant in Stalowa Wola in southwest Poland.   A communique issued Saturday by the shipyard strikers before thetalks described their mood as ``calm although not joyful.''   Strikers' ``main problem'' was lack of food, cigarettes, hygieneand ``bad weather,'' it said. Skies were overcast and cool Friday,but improved somewhat Saturday.   The communique made no mention of a suicide attempt Friday byone young striker. After the attempt, Walesa gave a morale-buildingtalk and the strikers took steps to organize themselves moreeffectively.   Prices in Poland have risen 42 percent price so far this year aspart of the government's austerity program.   In Washington, Deputy Secretary of State John C. Whiteheaddenounced the crackdown on strikers and said U.S. backing forPoland's economic recovery plan will remain frozen until theprogram wins popular support.</TEXT></DOC>
