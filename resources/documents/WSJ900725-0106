Bunzel</HL><DATE>07/25/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A12</SO><LP>   One of the fringe benefits of living in California ishaving the chance to hear the high-flown rhetoric andexcessive claims of Assembly Speaker Willie J. Brown Jr.,arguably the most powerful political leader in the statebeside the governor.   In the current efforts of the legislature to oversee andenforce &quot;comprehensive equity goals in higher education,&quot; Mr.Brown has already mounted the charge: &quot;Freedom may haveembraced Eastern Europe, but California's college anduniversity systems are still held hostage,&quot; he recentlyproclaimed. &quot;They are prisoners of racism, and their hostile,wholly intolerant environment is contributing to a higherdropout rate among people of color.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   To do something about what the speaker calls &quot;thisthriving injustice,&quot; Assemblyman Tom Hayden has introducedlegislation that would require all publicly supportedcolleges and universities to have by the year 2000 a studentbody that is proportionately representative &quot;of the ethniccomposition of recent high school graduates, both in firstyear classes and subsequent graduating classes.&quot;   The bill also provides for the continued use of &quot;specialadmissions standards&quot; to increase the enrollment proportionsof under-represented minority students whose grades and testscores are too low to qualify for admission through &quot;regular&quot;admissions categories.   In one form or another the Hayden bill is likely to winlegislative approval. And even if it is successfully vetoedby the governor, there is strong evidence that the 19-campusCalifornia State system and nine-campus University ofCalifornia system are prepared to carry out these mandateswith or without legislative action. In its determination toovercome ethnic underrepresentation, for example, UC Berkeleyis committed to a plan that &quot;enrolls new undergraduates fromall ethnic groups in proportion to their representation amonghigh school graduates.&quot;   Berkeley law professor Stephen Barnett has noted onepotential consequence of this policy: &quot;If `all' ethnicgroups, including whites, are entitled to proportionalrepresentation, then no ethnic groups -- including Asians --may be overrepresented. A policy of guaranteeing parity forevery ethnic group amounts to imposing a ceiling, or quota,on every other ethnic group.&quot;   This is not merely a theoretical observation. Over thepast six years, about 60% of California's high schoolgraduates -- and 70% of those academically eligible foradmission to the University of California system -- have beenwhite. Over those same six years, white freshmen enrollmentsat Berkeley have dropped to 32% from 58%. Black and Hispanichigh school students, who make up 2.5% and 7%, respectively,of those academically eligible for admission to the UCsystem, are 12% and 23% of those admitted. Asians constitute20% of high school graduates who are academically eligiblefor UC and 23% of the freshman class.   But Berkeley's white and Asian applicants are not likelyto benefit from racial parity anytime soon. Berkeleyofficials regularly assert that its race-specific admissionspolicy of granting preference to underrepresented minorityapplicants has not &quot;come at the expense of quality.&quot; But manyfaculty members contend that too many students have beenadmitted who are insufficiently qualified to do Berkeleywork. They are concerned that more than 90% of the Asian andwhite undergraduates at Berkeley have SAT scores higher thanthose of about 90% of the blacks and Hispanics. What iscalled the &quot;great accomplishment&quot; of slightly increasing themean SAT score of this year's entering freshmen, whilecontinuing to diversify the student body, ignores the SATdisparity between Asians/whites and blacks/Hispanics that hasbecome greater in the past decade.   &quot;The administration has simply traded off larger gainsamong Asians and whites -- larger because one is selectingthem from further out along the curve -- for smaller onesamong blacks and Hispanics,&quot; notes Berkeley anthropologyProf. Vincent Sarich. And, he adds, it is simple statisticsthat &quot;as you get more and more selective among Asians andwhites, the competitive gap necessarily increases.&quot; When 94%of Asians and whites have gotten better test scores than theaverage black freshmen, is it any wonder that blackgraduation rates are only about half that of whites?   One of the most disturbing developments in the currentequalitarian assault on the university occurred in April atBaruch College, the nation's largest business school, and oneof the institutions of the City University of New York. TheMiddle States Association of Colleges and Schools deferredrenewing the school's accreditation for several monthsbecause the minority representation on Baruch's faculty wasdeemed inadequate and its rate of graduating minoritystudents too low. The reaccreditation went through only latelast month, after the college submitted an &quot;action plan.&quot;   The implicit assumption that white faculty members cannotteach minority college students as well as minorityprofessors can is unfounded. (Nobody makes the reverseargument.) Nor do white or black students perform betteracademically if they are taught by persons of the same raceor color. We are told that minority students need rolemodels. Perhaps so. But they won't reduce the dropout ratesof blacks and Hispanics.   However, the criticism that too few minority students aregraduating from Baruch College is new and alarming. Onewonders how many other institutions will be threatened byMiddle States because they do not have the &quot;right&quot; racialproportions among their graduates. Are other accreditingorganizations now devising their own racial graduation quotasthat colleges and universities across the country will berequired to meet?   A more serious concern is that accrediting agencies willno longer put pressure, as they have in the past, oninstitutions if they are too lax in their academicrequirements. It now appears that institutions will bethreatened with disapproval if their requirements are toorigorous, a course of action that would underminelong-established standards when they produce unacceptablegraduation rates for minorities.   Educators and legislators need to confront some difficultproblems they have too often sidestepped. They could begin bydropping the faulty notion that mere numbers are the truemeasure of equity. If they did, they would then discover thateven if affirmative action were a science, as Asian Weekcolumnist Arthur Hu has observed, &quot;the law of equalproportions reflects racial equality about as well as theflat world theory explains geography.&quot; Then, perhaps, theywould understand why there cannot be both equal proportionsand equal standards.   ---   Mr. Bunzel, formerly president of San Jose StateUniversity and a member of the U.S. Commission on CivilRights, is now at Stanford's Hoover Institution.</TEXT></DOC>
