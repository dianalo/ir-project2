ANDREWS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A linguistics expert told a House impeachmentpanel Tuesday that a telephone conversation between federal judgeAlcee L. Hastings and a Washington lawyer in October 1981 wasspoken in code, possibly in an attempt to disguise details of abribery conspiracy.   The secretly tape-recorded phone call from Hastings to hislawyer friend, William A. Borders, is regarded as crucial tocharges that Hastings, a U.S. district court judge in Miami, soughtto conceal his role in the alleged bribery scheme by lying underoath and fabricating evidence at his trial five years ago.   Although Hastings was acquitted of conspiring to solicit a$150,000 bribe from two convicted racketeers, the House Judiciarysubcommittee on criminal justice is reviewing an investigativereport by a special panel of appeals court judges which found``clear and convincing evidence'' that Hastings committed the crimeand tried to cover it up.   Resuming its televised impeachment hearings Tuesday, thesubcommittee heard Roger W. Shuy, a linguistics professor atGeorgetown University, testify about his study of an FBI tape ofthe Oct. 5, 1981, conversation between Hastings and Borders.   Hastings says the 29-second conversation concerned some lettershe had drafted in support of efforts by another friend, HemphillPride of Columbia, S.C., regain his lawyer's credentials after hecompleted a three-year prison term for misappropriation of housingfunds.   Shuy said the recording ``indicates that Borders and Hastingswere using a code to convey information that was not obvious tooutsiders.''   He said his analysis, which employed several linguistictechniques and sophisticated electronic listening devices, led himto conclude that ``a not very well-practiced code was being used,''involving not only their words but ``the structure of thedialogue.''   Shuy refused to speculate what Hastings and Borders were reallydiscussing. But under questioning by House staff lawyers, Shuyconceded it was possible they were talking about details of paymentof the alleged bribe and whether Hastings should issue a reciprocalcourt order returning a major portion of forfeited assets seizedfrom the racketeers.   The panel is studying whether to recommend that the full Houseimpeach Hastings on the charges filed by a panel of the 11th U.S.Circuit Court of Appeals. If the House votes to impeach and theSenate convicts him in a subsequent trial, Hastings would beremoved from the federal bench.   The subcommittee has subpoenaed Borders to appear when itresumes its televised hearings Wednesday, but he was expected torefuse to testify.   Borders was convicted at a separate trial in 1982 of arrangingthe bribe allegedly intended for Hastings, but he has consistentlyrefused to testify about his close friend.   House investigators are eager to ask Borders whether Hastingswas aware that his friend was arranging a bribe for him. Hastingsinsists that he knew nothing of the bribery scheme and accusesBorders of trading on his name to shake down the two racketeers,Frank and Tom Romano.   Roberto Martinez, a former assistant U.S. attorney in Miami,testified Tuesday that two major undercover investigations wereabandoned in September 1985 after they were divulged by a leak ofinformation attributed to Hastings.   Martinez said Hastings learned of the investigations of unioncorruption on the Miami waterfront and corrupt zoning practices bycity officials in Hialeah, Fla., when Martinez gave Hastingsroutine progress reports on court-approved use of wiretaps in bothcases.   Hastings allegedly mentioned the investigations to Dade CountyMayor Steve Clark, who later told federal law enforcement officialsthat Hastings was the source of the leak, Martinez said.   Rep. John Bryant, D-Texas, said the Justice Department decidednot to prosecute because it did not believe it could win aconviction.   Martinez said under questioning that although he had``tremendous confidence in Judge Hastings'' before the incident, henow believed it would be ``dangerous'' for Hastings to have accessto sensitive information about federal criminal investigations.</TEXT></DOC>
