There were no reports of injuries or damage, but callers jammedtelephone lines for hours after the eruption a mile off the coast ofIto city, a seaside resort 62 miles southwest of Tokyo.   Hundreds of Ito's 72,000 residents fled, and city officials wereconsidering evacuating people living near the shore, according tothe Japan Broadcasting Corp. The Central Meteorological Agencyissued a navigation warning to ships in the area.   The volcano erupted at 6:30 p.m. on the ocean floor at a depth of330 feet, the Meteorological Agency said. Officials said earlier itoccurred at a depth of up to about 1,000 feet.   ``Right now, we don't know if this will lead to another, largereruption and can only tell people there to watch for furtherwarnings,'' said an agency official. ``Obviously, there could bedanger to Ito if a larger eruption occurs,'' he said, requestinganonymity.   The Japanese archipelago is of volcanic origin, and 80 volcanoesare believed to be active.   For hours after the eruption, calls to the Ito Police Departmentand City Hall were met with recorded messages asking callers to trylater due to ``extremely crowded lines.''   Along with the strong jolt of the eruption, slight tremors,possibly caused by the volcano, were felt throughout the evening,said the official from the Meteorological Agency.   Seismologists were surveying movements of underground magma inthe area. Large movements of magma can cause earthquakes, whichoften preceed volcanic eruptions.   More than 20,000 earthquakes have been recorded around Izu overthe past two weeks.   An official of the Seismic Division of the Central MeteorologicalAgency, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the nature of thequakes had changed since Tuesday night, with the most recent quakesoccurring more frequently and lasting up to 20 seconds.   On Wednesday, there were eight such temblors recorded, he said.   Between June 30 and noon Thursday, 22,328 temblors were recordedoff the Izu peninsula, the Central Meteorological Agency said. Mostwere at depths of two to 4.5 miles under the sea.   Twenty-one people suffered minor injuries when two earthquakesregistering 5.5 on the Richter scale hit Ito on Sunday.</TEXT></DOC>
