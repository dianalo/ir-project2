Major monetary nations, aided by declining U.S. interest rates and a heavy round of dollar profit-taking, had been having a respite in their battle against the stronger dollar.    But a favorable outlook for the U.S. economy and, until Friday at least, robust U.S. stock and bond markets have been boosting the dollar's prospects. That could give central banks little chance for rest in battling the currency's rise.    To rein in the dollar's rally, central banks may have to &quot;really gang up&quot; with concerted sales, says Mike Malpede, a senior currency analyst at Refco Inc. in Chicago.    Friday's concerted intervention, the first since mid-June, was far from a success. Despite a barrage of dollar sales -- from the U.S., Canada and a host of European nations -- the dollar was at 1.9405 marks and 141.85 yen in late New York trading, up sharply from 1.9055 marks and 139.85 yen late Thursday.    In Tokyo Monday, the U.S. currency opened for trading at 141.85 yen, up sharply from Friday's Tokyo close of 140.10 yen.    The dollar, above the key resistance point of 1.9 marks and poised for further gains, is close to the 2.0 mark resistance level that was particularly problematic for central banks early this summer. Once the dollar topped 2.0 marks, it went on to two-year peaks of 2.0475 marks and 151.85 yen June 15 before running out of steam.    It's widely thought that major industrial nations are uncomfortable with the dollar above 1.9 marks and 140 yen because a stronger U.S. currency can disturb the correction of trade imbalances. Inflationary pressures, too, can increase overseas when dollar-priced imports become more expensive. On Friday, central banks &quot;tested the waters to see how strong the dollar demand is,&quot; and they found out that it's pretty substantial, says Mr. Malpede.    Christiane Mandell, a trader at Security Pacific Merchant Bank in Los Angeles, agrees. &quot;There seems to be good, strong, legitimate dollar demand,&quot; she says, adding that the dollar has potential to test resistance around 1.96 marks in coming days.    &quot;We'll keep pushing at the upside. I think we have another two pfennigs on the upside&quot; before the dollar meets resistance followed by consolidation, Ms. Mandell predicted.    A less bearish outlook for U.S. interest rates is the main force behind the rising dollar, analysts say.    While lower U.S. rates hurt the dollar recently, buying is being revived by speculation the Federal Reserve will ease monetary policy reluctantly to foster an economy with relatively low inflation and moderate growth -- the &quot;soft landing&quot; to which economists refer. Lower rates are generally negative for the dollar because of diminished attractiveness of dollar-denominated securities. But lower rates are also a key element in the soft landing view that has attracted investors to U.S. financial markets this year.    And U.S. economic data &quot;are painting a nice, soft landing-type of scenario for the economy,&quot; says Ms. Mandell of Security Pacific.    Friday's data seem to support the soft landing picture. The producer-price index fell 0.4% in July, the largest decline in three years, while July retail sales rose 0.9%.    Some economists expect July's consumer price index, due Friday, to have risen 0.3%.    The Fed apparently is succeeding in fine-tuning the economy, and &quot;the bottom line is that the U.S. is seen as a good investment environment,&quot; says Mr. Malpede. He adds that there probably will be continued demand for U.S. stocks, bonds and, consequently, dollars.    Some stock market watchers say the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which flirted with a record high last week, probably will continue to climb. And some bond market players say U.S. bonds still have potential for more gains as well.    Analysts say bullishness about the U.S. economy could intensify if the merchandise trade data, due Thursday, are favorable. The trade deficit is estimated to have narrowed to $9.5 billion in June from $10.2 billion in May, according to an early survey of economists by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report. News of a deficit of less than $10 billion could cause another dollar-buying spree, traders say.    But while the dollar is strengthening, another decisive move above 2.0 marks isn't seen as likely soon because of the downward bias in U.S. rates and anticipated central bank intervention. Central banks may be quick to extinguish dollar rallies, fearing it won't take much buying to build momentum in the thin summer markets.    &quot;The dollar will not go up forever. It's still in a trading range with bullish undertones&quot; and should fluctuate between 1.8 and 2.0 marks in the next few months, asserts Diego Giurleo, senior Treasury bond manager at the Royal Bank of Canada. On the Commodity Exchange in New York Friday, gold for current delivery settled at $365.20 an ounce, down $2.10. Estimated volume was a moderate 4.2 million ounces.    In early trading in Hong Kong Monday, gold was quoted at $364.24 an ounce. </TEXT></DOC>
