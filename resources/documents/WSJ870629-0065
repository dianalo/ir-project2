Richard Gephardt of Missouri argues that those who prescribe free trade for America's competitive woes are &quot;living in the past.&quot; Former Gov. Bruce Babbitt of Arizona says Mr. Gephardt's own trade proposal &quot;makes no economic sense.&quot; And Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware says the tariffs and quotas that some of his rivals are advocating are &quot;blueprints for economic disaster.&quot;    The Democrats are also going different ways on taxes. Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts advocates a tax-enforcement plan that he says &quot;will take a substantial bite out of the federal deficit.&quot; Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois talks about cigarette and jewelry taxes. The Rev. Jesse Jackson argues for an oil-import fee.    Taxes and trade are the most difficult issues facing Democrats today. Even now, months before voters in this state participate in next February's precinct caucuses to select the first convention delegates, these issues are clouding the party's image as it seeks to define itself for the post-Reagan era. Democrats want to lose their identity as big taxers, but they still believe that new revenues are needed to close the budget deficit. They don't want to be known as protectionist, yet they still want to appeal to workers whose jobs are imperiled by imports.    While the Democrats remain split on some foreign-policy issues, the conventional wisdom is that unlike the case in the past three elections, the major contenders are in agreement on domestic issues. All oppose Reagan administration economic policies; they advocate giving higher priority to spending on education and on rebuilding the nation's infrastructure. Even on the sensitive subjects of taxes and trade, all the Democratic aspirants agree on a need for more revenue and on a tougher approach with trading partners, especially the Japanese.    But beneath the surface lie some important differences that seem certain to widen as the candidates' views on trade and taxes become more finely developed. On trade, the disagreements are already serious. On taxes, they are less so -- but that is little comfort, since few tactics are less promising than a campaign that suggests raising taxes. The challenge for the Democrats is to resolve the trade issue and finesse the tax issue.    &quot;The risk with these two issues is that we'll confirm the voters' attitude that Democrats will raise taxes and will be overly beholden to certain interests and quick-fix policies,&quot; says Paul Maslin, a Democratic political consultant who isn't working for any of the presidential candidates. &quot;The opportunity is that we can use these two issues to put the Republicans on the defensive, to portray them as the ones who have led us to these choices.&quot;    But the two issues, the pre-eminent economic topics for the 1988 presidential election, already are producing strains among traditional Democratic constituencies.    &quot;These are issues where the differences between the Democrats are going to be highlighted,&quot; says Larry Bartels, a University of Rochester expert on presidential primaries. &quot;These are the cues the candidates are going to use to convey broad notions about themselves. With so many candidates that are so unknown, voters will be grasping at these issues as handles to get a hold on the candidates.&quot;    Among Republicans, who are generally united in opposition to new taxes and additional trade barriers, the Democrats' problems produce glee. Rep. Jack Kemp of New York says the Democrats are &quot;in a political and intellectual cul-de-sac.&quot; Former Gov. Pierre du Pont of Delaware tells a gathering of Iowa Republicans that the Democrats' &quot;tangle of tariffs and quotas and taxes is kamikaze economics.&quot; And Vice President George Bush, addressing the Republican faithful at a party luncheon here, raises the specter of Democratic contenders trying &quot;to undo our many accomplishments&quot; on the economic front.    In truth, however, the Democrats can't agree on a single course, particularly on the trade issue. The seven contenders for the nomination are preparing for an all-out trade war of their own.    The dispute pits organized labor, one of the party's strongest constituencies, against traditional liberals, who recoil at the notion of their party's forsaking its internationalism and its longstanding commitment to free trade. It also pits farm-state Democrats, who fear that protectionism may lead to higher foreign barriers to American farm exports, against Rust Belt Democrats, who want protection from foreign industrial goods.    &quot;This is the classic internal Democratic dispute,&quot; says Richard Brody, a Stanford political scientist. &quot;This fight will get even hotter during the primary season and will stay alive right through the convention fights over the platform. And the fact that candidates already have fairly clear positions means that the eventual nominee won't have much mobility on a very divisive issue.&quot;    The man at the center of the storm is Mr. Gephardt, whose proposal holding out the threat of import quotas helped catapult him out of the Democratic pack even before former Sen. Gary Hart withdrew from the race. Mr. Gephardt, who has deployed one of the best campaign organizations in this state, is increasingly becoming a target for other Democrats.    Mr. Jackson says after a campaign appearance in Dubuque that the Gephardt amendment, which prevailed in the House this spring, reminds him of sending &quot;a lob shot across the tennis court and not being ready for the smash that's coming in return.&quot; Even so, he says he would vote for the amendment -- or for a similar proposal Mr. Simon has made in the Senate -- because he doesn't believe President Reagan has been vigilant enough on trade.    While Mr. Jackson emphasizes negotiation, many of the other Democrats, despite differences with Rep. Gephardt, also favor some form of trade restrictions. Mr. Hart's withdrawal leaves the Democratic field without a traditional free-trader.    &quot;The baton seems to be passing from people who were, as a given, free-traders to people who are feeling the pressure from unions and other special interests,&quot; says Ted Van Dyk, a longtime Democratic strategist. &quot;In the current crowd, there is nobody who is making the free-trade argument.&quot;    The one who comes closest is Gov. Dukakis. While even he would apply protection to endangered U.S. industries, it would be for limited periods and with the condition that the protected industry take steps to modernize itself and become more competitive. &quot;I don't think that protection should last more than five years,&quot; he says. &quot;There has to be a clear signal that after five years it's over.&quot;    The other Democrats want to go even further. Mr. Babbitt proposes that any nation running an overall multilateral trade surplus be required to reduce that surplus by a third each year or face across-the-board tariffs. Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee supports trade restrictions for industries, like shoes and textiles, &quot;where there is specific evidence of overwhelming unfairness or where an enormously high penetration of foreign goods threatens to destroy an American industry.&quot;    And Mr. Biden, who argues that quotas don't directly benefit workers or consumers, envisions temporary import protection for industries in the form of tariffs, not quotas; he proposes to use the estimated $10 billion that such a plan would raise to train or relocate workers injured by unfair trade practices. Mr. Biden, moreover, advocates automatic retaliation against countries that, like South Korea and Taiwan, fix their exchange rates and also have excessive trade surpluses.    The Democrats are closer to agreement on taxes, but they aren't eager to trumpet their conclusion that Americans don't pay enough to meet the nation's bills. Although a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll in April showed Americans evenly split over whether to raise excise taxes on cigarettes, beer and gasoline to reduce the deficit, many politicians agree that former Vice President Walter Mondale sealed his electoral doom in July 1984 when he advocated a tax increase.    Today the candidates almost ritualistically declare that a tax increase is a &quot;last resort&quot; -- the similarity in the wording they use is striking -- but none rule it out and some have urged Democratic constituencies to understand that new programs will mean new taxes.    &quot;If we want to finance government and finance services,&quot; Mr. Gephardt told the U.S. Conference of Mayors this month, &quot;we're going to have to ask people for their help.&quot;    That view is already attracting criticism. &quot;Taxes are in their bones,&quot; says Rep. Kemp, who has urged that GOP candidates pledge not to increase taxes. &quot;They seem to have bought on to the idea that the deficit is the major cause of all of our problems, and they've got nothing to do but come out for taxes.&quot;    As a result of such attacks, the Democrats are reluctant to highlight plans for new taxes. Sen. Biden, for example, says that any tax increase steep enough to make a dent would harm the economy. Even so, he proposes a series of excise taxes on such items as tobacco and alcohol, tied to new spending for drug-abuse and health-care programs.    The Democrats generally resist proposing to raise marginal income-tax rates. With the recent tax overhaul effort, lowered rates became too much of a populist issue. Sens. Biden, Gore and Simon all voted last autumn to create a new 35% top rate above the 28% rate ultimately established in the tax-revision bill, but they are backing away from that -- now that the bill is on the books and they are on the campaign trail.    &quot;To change it,&quot; says Sen. Biden, &quot;raises so many questions about the Democrats being the party of tax, tax, spend, spend.&quot;    At the same time, Mr. Dukakis is backing away from the tax issue by refusing to consider new revenues before a new tax-enforcement offensive is undertaken. He proposes a federal version of the enforcement plan he implemented in Massachusetts, arguing in a speech at Tufts University this spring that &quot;we should first collect the taxes that are already due.&quot; He tells campaign audiences he won't exclude the possibility new taxes may be needed, but he won't say now whether he advocates new taxes to reduce the deficit further.    The Dukakis position has won few converts. &quot;The figures simply don't add up at the federal level,&quot; says Mr. Babbitt, who undertook a tax-amnesty program when he was the governor of Arizona. &quot;You can factor that in, but it can't be your whole program.&quot;    Mr. Jackson, Sens. Simon and Biden, and Rep. Gephardt all advocate an energy tax, with the proposals often taking the shape of an oil-import fee with rebates to lower-income taxpayers.    &quot;This is the easiest tax of all to sell,&quot; says Thomas Mann, the executive director of the American Political Science Association. &quot;With gas prices low, they can hope no one will notice a little tax increase. And when you make it an oil-import tax you get the support of the domestic oil industry.&quot;    But Mr. Babbitt, for one, disagrees. He argues that an oil-import fee goes against the notion of open international markets and that excise taxes unfairly burden lower-income taxpayers. &quot;Regressive taxes are bad,&quot; he says. &quot;I thought we resolved that question at the beginning of the century.&quot;    Both Mr. Gore and Mr. Babbitt propose a combination of new revenues, domestic spending cuts and restraint in military spending. Mr. Babbitt wants to broaden the tax base by eliminating the mortgage deduction on second homes. He would, moreover, limit the mortgage-interest deduction to $20,000 for a joint return.    Sen. Simon, who when he successfully challenged GOP Sen. Charles Percy in 1984 had to defend himself against charges that he was a big taxer, argues that he would rather raise taxes than borrow more and increase the deficit. Mr. Gephardt has sponsored a congressional resolution opposing excise taxes and is advocating a tougher minimum tax; the steep minimum tax he advocated in the House Ways and Means Committee was watered down in the tax-overhaul fight.    &quot;The Democratic candidates this time all know we need revenue,&quot; says William Hamilton, a Democratic political pollster. &quot;The public attitude isn't as violently against taxes as a lot of people think, but these Democratic candidates aren't crazy. They know they can't use taxes as a central theme.&quot;    ---              Democrats on Tax and Trade Issues   Candidate -- Bruce Babbitt   Taxes -- Broaden tax base by eliminating mortgagededuction for second homes and limiting mortgage deductionsto $20,000 for joint filers.
