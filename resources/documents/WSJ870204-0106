SubsidiaryRaises Prices of Methanol</HL><DD> 02/04/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> CZ </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Celanese Corp.'s Celanese Chemical Co. subsidiary said tighter supplies and increased demand led it to raise all methanol prices that aren't governed by contracts, effective last Monday.    Prices were raised as much as 20%, depending on delivery and purchase terms. Celanese set the price for barge shipments, f.o.b. the Gulf Coast, at 30 cents a gallon, and at 32 cents a gallon for tank car and tank wagon shipments from the gulf.    Methanol, a solvent and feedstock used to make compounds such as formaldehyde and plastics, is also used as fuel in Europe. After being in oversupply for a number of months, a Celanese Chemical spokesman in Dallas said, supply has tightened as demand has increased and several plants have closed temporarily. The increase, he said, is &quot;an effort to get to a more healthy pricing level.&quot;    Celanese Chemical has a major methanol plant in south Texas, a facility in Canada and a joint venture in a major plant in Saudi Arabia. </TEXT></DOC>
