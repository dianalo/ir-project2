 Times have changed and many computercompanies are not keeping up the changing demands of the customerbase.andP;  Particularly hard-hit have been large firms that havecontinued to push proprietary solutions on a market that isembracing standards and open systems.andP;  These companies are nowtrying to play both ends of the spectrum by retaining theirproprietary designs while also joining in the open systems game.andO;Companies that rely on federal contracts and systems integrationare not likely to fare much better, as budget cuts take their tollacross the board.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Open SystemsComputer IndustryMismanagementUser NeedsEconomics of ComputingIndustry AnalysisOutlookDemandNational Government.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Golden Growth Days Are Gone; Many Won't SurviveandM;Back in the 1970s and even earlier, the communities along Route 128, whichcircles Boston, were a hot-bed of high-tech activity.andP;  Digital EquipmentCorp. was well on its way to becoming No.andP;  2 in the computer industry.andO;Honeywell Information systems, having acquired General Electric Co.'scomputer business, seemed poised to play a major role.andM;Data General Corp., which was a DEC spin-off, and Prime Computer Inc. hadestablished seemingly unshakable beach-heads in the flourishing minicomputersector.andM;Among the reasons for this high-tech concentration around Boston were theproximity of prominent institutions of higher learning; a well-educated laborpool; and a well-developed local financial infrastructure including venturecapital funds ready and willing to stake high-tech start-ups.andM;Remember, in those golden days any idea having to do with high-growth-forevercomputing was embraced by the financiers without too many questions.andM;By the end of the 1980s, however, the bloom was off the rose.andP;  Many ofyesterday's seemingly firmly entrenched stars like DEC and HoneywellInformation Systems (sold to Groupe Bull of France) have fallen on hardtimes.andP;  Why?andM;As I see it, each has fallen victim to its management's inability orunwillingness to adjust to the forward march of technology, the growingacceptance of standards, and users' enthusiastic embrace of the client-servermodel as opposed to hierarchical, host-based computing.andM;The deployment of ever-more-powerful and versatile microprocessors onincreasingly complex but more cost-effective system designs, like strongmedicine introduced into the human body, still is working its way througheach product line based on a proprietary architecture.andM;Clearly, the companies financial statements reflect the suffering.andP;  Tocompete while supporting a proprietary product line, and at the same timedevelop and bring to market a distributed, standards-compliant architecture,requires expanded Randamp;D.andM;Meanwhile, slowed customer demand reflects a certain degree of confusion inthe marketplace.andP;  To make matters worse, the new product lines carry lowerprofit margins than the boxes based on proprietary architecture.andM;These structural changes were predicted by independent industry watchers asearly as the late 1970s.andP;  Regrettably, some companies' managers virtuallyignored what was happening.andP;  Most of these companies already have paid a highprice.andM;In California's Silicon Valley, just as on Route 128, complacency in the faceof structural change has taken its toll.andP;  Apple Computer Inc.'s glory daysmay be coming to an end.andP;  Convergent Technologies had to sell out to UnisysCorp., and Fairchild Semiconductor had to be rescued by Schlumberger, aFrench company.andM;The obvious question is whether the Washington area, another mecca forhigh-tech start-ups, faces a similar fate.andP;  Washington's strength has beenmost pronounced in professional services such as program development andsystems integration.andM;Like the Route 128 and Silicon Valley environs, the Washington region isblessed by the presence of several highly regarded universities.andP;  Skilledstaffs and ideas have been nurtured by huge government-sponsored high-techresearch programs.andP;  Funding has come from venture capital pools Baltimore andNew York.andM;Yet the prognosis for this region's high tech companies is not good.andP;  Budgetcuts, especially at the Defense Department, and delays in authorizing fundsfor already-awarded contracts are putting pressure on many high-techcompanies.andM;Restructuring and outright withdrawal from the federal market are the name ofthe game in this town.andM;Will this period of travail pass?andP;  Yes, but most likely only those with asound business strategy, deep pockets or a determination to hang in at allcosts will be around to enjoy the next round.andM;Ulric Weil is president of Weil andamp; Associates, a Washington consulting firm.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
