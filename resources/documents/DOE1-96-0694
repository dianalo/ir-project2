<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-96-0694 </DOCNO><TEXT>The authors consider the magnetohydrodynamic and thermodynamic stabilityof an incompressible isotropic electrically nonconductive magnetic liquidwith respect to infinitesimally small two-dimensional perturbations ofplanar stead-state nonisothermal flow in a channel with thermostatedwalls near the Curie point in the presence of gradients of pressure andthe external magnetic field. The system of equations describing the flowmake use of the Rosenzweig-Neuringer approximation.</TEXT></DOC>
