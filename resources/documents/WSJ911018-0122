ATandamp;T said that without the charges, its results would haveoutperformed last year's third period. ATandamp;T said that thecharges won't affect its dividend and that it expects to posta profit for the year.</LP><TEXT>   Most of ATandamp;T's gains in the third period came from itslong-distance telephone business, which continued to takeback market share from competitors, and itsfinancial-services unit, where revenue climbed 73%. Equipmentsales, by contrast continued to slump, led by computerrevenues, which with NCR's computer numbers, fell 17% in thequarter.   ATandamp;T and NCR for the first time combined their financialresults after completing their merger Sept. 19. Charges cutATandamp;T profit $2.65 billion, or $2.06 a share, for a net lossof $1.8 billion, or $1.40 a share, compared with net incomeof $803 million, or 62 cents a share, a year earlier.Revenue, including NCR's, was $11.04 billion, 1.2% more thanthe $10.91 billion recorded a year earlier.   In the first nine months, the loss was $113 million, ornine cents a share, compared with combined earnings of $2.3billion, or $1.79 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 3% to$32.71 billion from $31.74 billion.   NCR's third-quarter numbers show that the Dayton, Ohio,computer maker is suffering from the same recessionaryproblems affecting other computer makers and that it won't bea near-term growth engine for ATandamp;T. NCR posted a net loss of$82 million on revenue of $1.38 billion, down 10%. Inaddition, NCR's gross margins fell 2.8 percentage points to42.9%. NCR results were &quot;below original estimates,&quot;acknowledged Alex Mandl, ATandamp;T's chief financial officer andgroup executive. &quot;{But} they are in line with the rest of theindustry.&quot;   ATandamp;T said that had it not been for the charges, NCRresults and the merger's impact on shares outstanding, netwould have been $808 million, or 73 cents a share, comparedwith $712 million, or 65 cents a share, a year earlier. Abouttwo cents of this per-share gain came from the sale of SunMicrosystems Inc. shares in September, it said.   In July, ATandamp;T said it would take as much as $4 billion incharges to cover its absorption of NCR; to restructure itsoffice phone systems business and cut its workforce; and toeliminate a $300 million service subsidy for Alascom toprovide long-distance service to Alaskans. In addition, NCRtook a $200 million charge in the quarter to covermerger-related expenses, a jury award and the planned closingof its Cambridge, Ohio, manufacturing plant. All of thisbrought total charges to $4.2 billion.   However ATandamp;T, which has already taken more than $24billion in pretax charges against earnings since its 1984breakup, said the latest charge should be its last for theforeseeable future. &quot;We don't anticipate any furtherwrite-downs,&quot; Mr. Mandl said in a conference call withanalysts and reporters.   Still, for some ATandamp;T workers the pain from the company'smassive restructuring will linger for years. ATandamp;T said itwill cut 14,000 people from its work force, through earlyretirements and dismissals, by January 1994 because of thelatest restructurings.   About 4,300 of these workers were recently notified thattheir jobs are being phased out, and 1,300 have left thecompany since July, a spokesman said. At the end ofSeptember, ATandamp;T had 325,000 employees, including NCR workers,compared with 278,000 a year earlier, the company said.   &quot;The good news . . . is the continuing strength of . . .long distance . . . and the strong actions we're taking forfuture earnings growth,&quot; said ATandamp;T Chairman Robert E. Allenin a statement.   &quot;Earnings of more than 70 cents is clearly very good in atotally lousy economy,&quot; said Jack B. Grubman,telecommunications analyst at PaineWebber. &quot;ATandamp;T is alsowreaking havoc on its long-distance competitors; Sprint isn'tgrowing and MCI's margins are suffering.&quot;   &quot;ATandamp;T has very good operating momentum in a number of itsbusinesses,&quot; said Marianne Bye, an analyst at Shearson LehmanBrothers Inc. &quot;If the economy turns and they eliminate lossesin their computer and office phone-equipment businesses, ATandamp;Tshould have very good operating leverage in 1992.&quot;   Broken down, ATandamp;T's long-distance service revenue rose5.1% to $5.24 billion on traffic volume growth of nearly 6.5%from a year earlier and more than 2% from the second quarter.MCI Communications Corp. volume grew 3.2% since June 30, butfrom a smaller base than ATandamp;T's, and traffic volume at USSprint Communications Co., a unit of UnitedTelecommunications Inc., remained flat.   Sales of computer products and systems dropped 17% to $818million. The results include NCR computer revenue along withrevenue from ATandamp;T Computer Systems and ATandamp;T's UNIX SystemLaboratories unit. Excluded from this total are other NCRrevenue from rentals, systems service and microchips.   Overall product and system sales fell 5.5% to $3.81billion, although ATandamp;T claimed without giving numbers thatsales of its consumer phones and microelectronics devicesshowed sharp gains.   Revenue from communications network equipment rose 3.1% to$1.8 billion. A decline in sales to U.S. phone companies wasoffset by increased equipment sales to cellular-phonecompanies, ATandamp;T said. International equipment sales wereflat.   The recession continued to hurt ATandamp;T's sales ofcommunications systems to businesses. Revenue from businesscommunications equipment fell 8.6% to $714 million from $781million. Revenue from rentals and other services fell 2.9% to$1.64 billion.   However, ATandamp;T continued to gather strength as a financialservices company. Revenue from financial services and leasinggrew to $358 million from $208 million and were helped by biggains in its Universal credit card units. Revenue in thefirst nine months rose to $964 million from $502 million.   ATandamp;T, which had issued additional stock in connection withthe NCR merger, said it now has 1.3 billion sharesoutstanding.</TEXT></DOC>
