<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-62-0433 </DOCNO><TEXT>A previously discussed local mixing model (LMM) accurately describes thebuildup of implanted hydrogen to saturation concentration and subsequentisotope exchange for implantation into a variety of materials of interestto the fusion community. Sputtering and surface deposition were not initiallyincluded in this model. We have now incorporated into the LMM the effectsof sputtering and target-atom redepostion and have also included (inan approximate fashion) the slowing and scattering of implanted ionsby previously implanted impurity species. This latter effect has importantconsequences for high fluence implants. Equations are derived which governthe evolution of the depth profiles of the implanted species and a formalsolution is given for conditions which often are encountered in laboratoryexperiments. The time (fluence) dependence of the depth profile is discussed,and numerical results are compared with experiment for oxygen implantationinto graphite at energies for which surface erosion is a significanteffect. Solutions to the equations are also discussed for cases in whichsurface redeposition is significant. These latter solutions are pertinentto impurity and hydrogen isotope buildup in first wall components inoperating fusion reactors.</TEXT></DOC>
