The Merc also alleged that Gerald allowed another firm to trade through Gerald and make trades &quot;almost exclusively opposite simultaneous buying and selling orders entered by the foreign broker&quot; in a process known as &quot;wash&quot; trading. Wash trading violates exchange rules in part because it is done to generate trading volume, rather than for economic reasons.    Chicago Merc compliance officials said they expected to take disciplinary action against the other firm within about three weeks as part of a continuing investigation of questionable trading practices by some Japanese brokerage firms executing trades through U.S. brokers.    Gerald didn't admit or deny the exchange allegations when it agreed to the fine. Gerald officials couldn't be reached for comment.    In January the exchange fined Shatkin Trading Co. $70,000 based on similar allegations. And last year the Merc levied $100,000 fines against both Clayton Brokerage Co. of St. Louis and Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. on similar allegations. </TEXT></DOC>
