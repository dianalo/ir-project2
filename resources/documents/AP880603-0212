Four other hostages slipped out of the bank through a bathroomwindow early Friday, said officials in Goioere, a town of 30,000about 550 miles southwest of Rio de Janeiro in Parana state. Tenothers were released after the men holed up in the bank Thursdayafternoon.   Police chief Guaraci Abreu said the two men were young ``andvery professional. They know what they want.''   He said the gunmen had doubled their cash demand to theequivalent of $100,000 and wanted a car without license plates.``Otherwise they said they would start killing hostages one by one,and I believe them,'' he said by telephone.   Justice Secretary Antonio Lopes Noronha, heading a negotiatingteam, suspended payment of the ransom even though the money hadbeen collected from other banks.   ``We won't try to storm the bank because we do not want to riskhostages' lives, but we won't pay either. We'll just sit tight andwait,'' he told reporters.   The bandits, each armed with two revolvers, entered the Bank ofBrazil branch minutes before closing Thursday afternoon andoverpowered two guards, then the alarm sounded and police arrivedmoments later.   After the guards and 24 other employees were taken hostage,about 150 state troopers and municipal police surrounded the bank.   On Thursday night the gunmen released the two guards and sevenfemale bank tellers. They also freed a sick man.   Bank holdups have increased in Brazil, where inflation isrunning at a projected annual rate of 600 percent. Police oftenhave allowed robbers to flee in order to save the lives of hostages.</TEXT></DOC>
