Despite Kemp's efforts, staffing problems caused by budgetconstraints threaten to undermine even the best attempts to rid theDepartment of Housing and Urban Development of mismanagement andpolitical influence, Inspector General Paul A. Adams said in thereport issued Wednesday.   ``The department and OIG (Office of the Inspector General) facecritical staffing shortages resulting'' from across-the-boardbudget cuts made under the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law,Adams said in his semiannual report to Congress.   ``Adequate staffing, continuity of leadership and managementaccountability are essential if the reform measures are to work,''he said.   Adams said that while it was premature to grade the substance ofKemp's efforts, the secretary ``has already taken aggressivecorrective actions and proposed widespread reform measures,including the elimination of programs not benefiting the needy.''   Adams said the media and congressional attention HUD hasreceived since April, when his report on a rehabilitation programriddled with wasteful spending and political favoritism was issued,have complemented Kemp's reform efforts.   ``The positive aspect of the current situation is that itcreates an environment in which needed reform can take place,''Adams said. ``While it is too soon to predict the reform actions'success, I will continue to evaluate the effectiveness of thosemeasures.''   Kemp, in a separate report to Congress, said his management teamhad resolved 97 percent of the nearly 1,700 internal auditrecommendations awaiting management action when he took over HUDearly this year.   ``HUD's management team is aggressively cleaning up problemswhich, over many years and during several administrations, havemade well-intentioned programs susceptible to fraud, politicalinfluence and the waste of taxpayers' hard-earned dollars,'' Kempsaid.   Adams' report recounted the problems found in virtually all ofHUD's major housing and loan programs _ fraud, waste andmismanagement with a pricetag estimated at more than $6 billion.   The government, Adams said, could save millions if Congresswould amend federal housing laws to allow refinancing of HUD-backedmortgages at today's more favorable interest rates. He renewed hiscall for Congress to grant inspectors general subpoena powers toforce witnesses to cooperate with investigations.   He warned that HUD's Government National Mortgage Association _often referred to as ``Ginnie Mae'' _ saw its default portfoliogrow from $3.1 billion to $12.5 billion last year, in large partbecause of bad real estate markets in ``oil patch'' states.   Adams said the agency needs to increase its reserves to offsetlosses and take steps to reduce future defaults.   Kemp acknowledged in his report that no steps had been taken toimprove GNMA management, but said an analysis was underway.   Since April, Adams said HUD has recovered more than $25 millionowed the government, implemented reforms that saved $21 million andcommitted itself to recovering another $50 million.</TEXT></DOC>
