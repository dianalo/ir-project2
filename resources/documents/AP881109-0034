A spokeswoman for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,which regulates 4,450 nationally chartered banks, said Tuesday thatthe agency's examiners will receive new guidelines within the nextseveral weeks requiring them to evaluate financial institutions'risk from making loans in leveraged buyouts.   ``We want to make sure banks are doing a very careful analysis ofexactly what the risks are,'' spokeswoman Lee Cross said.   Leveraged buyouts have become increasingly common in recent yearsamid an explosion of corporate takeovers.   Two weeks ago, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan,whose agency regulates bank holding companies, told the SenateBanking Committee he has warned banks making leveraged buyout loansto consider borrowers' prospects ``in a range of economic andfinancial circumstances.''   L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit InsuranceCorp., which insures commercial bank deposits, has said theproliferation of leveraged buyouts is increasing the risk to thefinancial system.   In a leveraged buyout, such as Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co.'s$20.6 billion bid for RJR Nabisco Inc., an investment group usesmostly borrowed money to purchase a company. The debt is repaideither with the acquired company's cash flow or with money raised bythe sale of some of its assets.   Often the investors are the target company's managers, who areacting to thwart a threatened takeover by outsiders.   The popularity of such deals and the resulting mushrooming ofdebt has led to concern about the ability of debt-burdened companiesto withstand an economic downturn.   Critics of the financing trend say most of the deals have beenput together since 1982, when the economy began expanding, and havenot been tested by a recession.   If a highly capitalized company suffers a downturn, the value ofits stock falls. However, a highly leveraged company could be forcedinto bankruptcy after a setback to pay creditors.   According to Loan Pricing Corp., a New York company whichmonitors large bank loans to corporations, banks have lent $70billion to highly-leveraged transactions since mid-1987. Leveragedbuyout and takeover lending comprised 59 percent of the banks bigcorporate loans in the July-September quarter.   Ms. Cross said the comptroller's office began revising itsleveraged buyout guidelines after surveying the practices of 11large money center banks and five regional institutions in latespring and early summer.   ``We found that so far the banks that have been involved seem tohave taken a pretty reasonable approach. ... No bank was perfect ...but we did not see any really substantial problems,'' Ms. Cross said.   But, she said, ``Our concern now is going forward as competitionin this area heats up.''   The new examiniation guidelines will not impose limits onleveraged buyout lending, but Ms. Cross said they will directexaminers to determine if a banks' policies include limits on suchlending as a whole and limits for single deals.   One problem in developing the guidelines is that banks havewidely varying definitions for what they consider highly leveragedlending, she said.</TEXT></DOC>
