Among the employees targeted is Mercedes-Benz AG ChairmanWerner Niefer, who also is deputy chairman of Daimler-BenzAG. Mr. Niefer is already the center of a separatetax-evasion case.</LP><TEXT>   Prosecutors said their suspicions grew from informationfurnished by an anonymous source and declined to disclosetheir findings in the case.   Daimler-Benz's Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm G.m.b.H.aerospace unit also has been linked to illegal aid for SaddamHussein's weapons programs. MBB has denied any wrongdoing.   Daimler-Benz denied the allegations of illegal truck salesto Iraq. It also refuted reports that the deliveries of thevehicles went through Mercedes-Benz's Brazilian subsidiary.Spokesman Matthias Kleinert said Daimler-Benz will itselfmove against &quot;any black sheep&quot; found to have accepted bribesfrom clients.   Helmut Werner, head of Mercedes-Benz's truck division,said Friday that the company last delivered trucks to Iraqlast summer as part of an order for 124 2635S models. Only 12had been delivered before Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait,after which the remaining 112 were sent to be stored in theNetherlands. Plans to produce Mercedes-Benz trucks in Iraqunder license were also halted after Aug. 2, he said.   Mr. Werner said Daimler-Benz, which like other Germancompanies was encouraged by Bonn to do business in the MiddleEast, was a major supplier of vehicles to Iraq in the early1980s.   He said the anonymous tip could be referring to an orderfrom Saudi Arabia in December 1990. Saudi Arabia's militarycommand asked for delivery of 17 model 3850 heavy trucks withtrailers sturdy enough to carry tanks. But Mr. Werner saidDaimler-Benz this month decided against filling the order onrecommendation from the Bonn government, where officials hopeto prevent any further flaps over arms-related exports tosensitive regions.</TEXT></DOC>
