Danny Wall,chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.   Wall, speaking to the National Association of Federal CreditUnions, said the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., whichbacks Sandamp;L deposits up to $100,000, has about $20 billion to workwith over the next three years.   President Reagan in August signed legislation recapitalizingFSLIC, which was technically insolvent and unable to deal withfailed Sandamp;Ls. The legislation provides $10.8 billion over threeyears from the sale of bonds, to be paid off by a specialassessment on profitable institutions.   Wall said it's too soon to determine whether that will be enoughto handle the industry's problems, particularly in the Southwestwhere Sandamp;Ls have been hard hit by the faltering energy industry andthe consequent moribund real estate market.   ``There's no way of knowing what the (regional) economies willbe or will have been in three years. ... (A rebound) could occur inTexas. It could occur in other areas of the country. It could blowall of our problems completely out of the water in a positiveway,'' Wall said.   His comments came less than a week after two thrift industrylobby groups began discussing the future of the insurance fund.   A committee of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, thelargest Sandamp;L trade association, discussed a plan that would requirebillions of taxpayer dollars to bail out the ailing thrift industry.   According to Mark Clark, a vice president of the league, thecommittee talked about a number of possible scenarios, includingone that envisioned the issue of government notes to Sandamp;Ls. Thenotes would be traded for bad loans owned by Sandamp;Ls and would beguaranteed by the U.S. Treasury.   Clark said the committee meeting was simply a ``brain-stormingsession'' and the plan ``is by no stretch of the imagination aproposal.''   The U.S. League discussion, as well as a proposal to mergeinsurance funds, are particularly controversial because the thriftindustry, seeking a smaller burden on healthy Sandamp;Ls, argued for asmaller recapitalization of FSLIC.   The National Council of Savings Institutions, another tradeassociation, is proposing, as a contingency plan, a merger of FSLICwith the Federal Deposit Insurance Fund, which had $18.3 billion atthe end of 1987.   The plan is unpopular with banks, which pay a premium fordeposit insurance that is less than half the premium paid bysavings institutions. A merger with the National Credit Union ShareInsurance Fund, which has about $1.3 billion, is equally unpopularwith that industry.   John T. Morgan, chairman of the council, said last week thatFSLIC likely won't have enough money to take care of all insolventSandamp;Ls. Wall talked of resolving the cases of 50 insolvent Sandamp;Ls thisyear in addition to about 100 cases in Texas. Losses for theindustry as a whole are expected to surpass $4 billion for 1987.   Morgan argues that there's a limit to how much more healthy Sandamp;Lscan contribute and that Congress will not want to earmark tax moneywithout first tapping into the other insurance funds.   Rep. Gerald Kleckza, D-Wis., has introduced legislation thatwould merge the three insurance funds, as well as the federalagencies that regulate the three segments of the financial system.The council, however, would keep the regulatory agencies separate.   Wall said he saw little prospect, at least in the near term,that Congress would approve a merger of the funds or of theregulatory apparatus and he argued that they were better left apart.</TEXT></DOC>
