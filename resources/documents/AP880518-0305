Edgar Hoover himself took a personal interest in MissHellman's activities,'' Mitgang observes in ``Dangerous Dossiers:Exposing the Secret War Against America's Greatest Authors''(Donald I. Fine, Inc., $18.95).   ``In a letter written to the FBI special agent in New York in1943 _ in the middle of World War II, when Nazi agents and theGerman-American Bund were operating in the United States _ Hoovercalled for a comprehensive report on her.''   The scene might be laughable, were it not for the questionableuse of manpower, with the nation's very security in jeopardy, thatit suggests.   ``Dangerous Dossiers'' is first-class journalism as well asessential documentation on the history and nature of creativefreedom in the United States.   ``This writer,'' Mitgang notes in the concluding chapter, ``doesnot believe that authors are wiser or more talented than any othercreators in this country; nor should they be singled out asprivileged characters. ...   ``However, there is one major difference that distinguishes therole played by the press, literature and printing from otherprofessions. The framers of the Constitution built the FirstAmendment guarantee of freedom of expression _ without abridgmentof any kind _ into the democratic structure of the new Republic.''   ``Dangerous Dossiers'' represents a long and sometimesfrustrating effort by Mitgang, cultural correspondent for The NewYork Times, to test the vitality of that guarantee by examiningFBI, CIA and other government files on prominent writers, includingNobel laureates Ernest Hemingway, John Steinbeck and WilliamFaulkner, using the Freedom of Information Act.   Mitgang is the author of four biographies, four novels, and 10other works of nonfiction, including two books and a play on thelife of Abraham Lincoln.   He began his inquiry by asking for previously secret governmentrecords on poet and fellow Lincoln biographer Carl Sandburg. Thatproduced an Army intelligence file of six pages and an FBI dossiercontaining 23 censored pages.   ``It wasn't hard,'' he says of the enterprise. ``It was just along wait.''   Most of the material was heavily censored, generally to protectthe government informants, and efforts to obtain the blacked-outmaterial generally were futile.   Though some of the targets of government observation might, withgood reason, ridicule the extreme effort (economist-diplomat JohnKenneth Galbraith was thought to be the disciple of an unidentifiedsubversive called ``Dr. Ware,'' the result of a misunderstanding byan agent who heard Galbraith's views described as ``doctrinaire'')many others, Mitgang says, suffered.   Steinbeck attempted to join the Army during World War II,Mitgang recalls, ``at the very same time that he was writingspeeches for President Roosevelt and for the head of the Air Force.   ``He was good enough to do that, but he was not allowed tobecome a second lieutenant in the Army because the FBI hadspecifically attacked him as something close to a red because of`The Grapes of Wrath,' which was considered a subversive book.''   Many of the dozens of novelists and short-story writers, poetsand essayists, playwrights and artists identified in ``DangerousDossiers'' as having secret files never knew they were beingtracked by Hoover's men or other government sleuths. And not one,Mitgang says, ever was accused of a crime.   Galbraith, in fact, estimates for the author that the governmentspent hundreds of thousands of dollars investigating him.   ``By a wide margin,'' the former U.S. ambassador to India says,``it was the most expensively researched enterprise with which Ihave ever been associated.''   And why? Apparently because someone to whom the FBI listeneddisagreed with his economic theories. ``Among other things,''Mitgang writes, ``the Galbraith file noted that `the subject leanedas far to the left as President Roosevelt.'''   The disturbing aspect to all of this is that association with agroup the government considered left-of-center or the word of anunnamed snitch was all that it took to start a file in Washington.Rarely, if ever, did an agent appear to have read what the subjectof his report had written, Mitgang observes.   ``These are raw files,'' the author says of his source material.``They were put in by unnamed informants _ in every case, the namesof informants were blacked out _ without any right ofconfrontation, or without any ability to dispute what was said. Andas a result of that, you have accusations by faceless peoplewithout a chance to answer.''   Today, Mitgang writes, the government will expunge an incorrectrecord, but not for a subject no longer living. ``The lesson isclear,'' he writes. ``Don't die if you want to reclaim your goodname and reputation.''   Despite the tightening of rules against spying on ordinarycitizens, Mitgang says government surveillance continues.   ``Three thousand pages were obtained very recently by the Centerfor Constitutional Rights . . . and what they found out was thatanyone who went to Central America, who signed a petition againstthe Contras . . . any of these people found themselves in files,''Mitgang says.   ``And the targets in recent months that emerged were suchorganizations as the Maryknoll sisters, the United Auto Workers,the National Council of Churches and I'm sure anyone who took avisa to go to Central America.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Weekend Editions, May 27-29</NOTE></DOC>
