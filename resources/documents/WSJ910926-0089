Although most parents strive for continuity, studies showthat about one-half of employed mothers who pay for childcare change their arrangements each year, says Arthur C.Emlen, a professor emeritus at Portland State University inOregon and a consultant on dependent-care issues. The reasonscited most often: a care giver quit, the cost was too high,the hours were wrong, the location was inconvenient, a childwas unhappy or a parent disliked the care giver.   The problem is costly for employers. Preliminary data froma survey of 2,300 employed mothers, set for release nextmonth, show that 15% reported some time lost from work in thepast month because child care had broken down. The Child CareAction Campaign, an advocacy group, puts the annual cost toU.S. business at $3 billion.   &quot;I don't see much evidence that turnover has gottenbetter&quot; in recent years, says Mr. Emlen, who has studieddependent care since 1965. The supply of relatives who helpout has dwindled as more women have taken other jobs. Also,&quot;people's standards are going up,&quot; Mr. Emlen says.   Meg Mahoney, a Minneapolis-area mother, missed two days asa retail buyer after her sitter gave her less than a day'snotice that she was quitting to take a manufacturing job.When an Eden Prairie, Minn., preschool filed for protectionfrom creditors, Thomas J. Schmid, a professor at MankatoState University, lost a lot of work time and finally had totransfer his two-year-old to a more distant school.   Suzanne Shelton-Foley has had seven child-carearrangements for her five-year-old twins. She recentlystarted a public relations and marketing firm in Chicago togain flexibility. &quot;It's gotten to the point where I'm nolonger surprised when someone says, `I'm sorry this report isa week late, but my sitter quit,'&quot; she says.                                                                                                          School, Employers Spur   Parental Involvement                                                                                                          FOR A LONG TIME, Jim McCormick didn't know hiseight-year-old son was having trouble reading at school. Thechild might still be struggling, except for an unusualprogram sponsored by Mr. McCormick's employer, RidgeviewInc., and school officials in Newton, N.C.   Every two months, seven school counselors visit the makerof hosiery and socks for 15-minute conferences with 57parents who work there. After Mr. McCormick, a supervisor,met with his son's counselor, he started working with thechild at home, and the boy overcame his problem.   The three-year-old program has cut truancy to zero amongchildren of participants, says Susan McGee, a guidancecounselor, who helped invent it. The program draws 100%participation by more than 100 parents at two participatingemployers. Before the program started, workers had to take apay cut for time lost attending school conferences.   Counselors are seeing parents who haven't set foot in aschool since they graduated or dropped out. Participation byfathers has also soared -- a benefit of &quot;meeting parents ontheir own turf,&quot; Ms. McGee says. &quot;And it costs us nothing butour time.&quot;                                                                                                          Baby Boom Faces Care   Of Aging Relatives                                                                                                          AS BABY BOOMERS age, the average worker may soon have moreolder relatives than children to care for.   Most employers think of child care as the most common areaof conflict between work and family, and it tends to be thefamily issue raised most often by employees and politicalgroups. But over the next three decades, the number ofdependent elders -- primarily aging relatives or in-laws whoneed intermittent or constant caremay actually surpass thenumber of dependent children in the U.S., Census Bureaustatistics show. That seems certain to shift public pressuretoward more elder-care help, such as adult day care orbroader tax breaks for elder care expenses.   Much depends on such uncertainties as the future rate atwhich people have babies and die and the number of immigrantswho settle in the U.S., says Mercedes Bern-Klug, an analystfor the National Institute on Aging. Also, there is no way oftelling how many people in a certain age group will bedependent.   Nevertheless, by the year 2020, Americans under the age of18 are expected to drop to 19% to 24% of the population from26% currently, Census Bureau projections show. At the sametime, people over 65 will rise to 20% of the population,compared with 13% now. By the year 2040, an estimated 17% to24% will be under 18, with 26% to 28% over 65.   The trend is already in place. A recent InternationalBusiness Machines survey showed the proportion of itsemployees with elder dependents doubled between 1986 and1991, to 16% from 8%.                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          FLEXIBLE WORK schedules are paying unexpected dividendsfor Wells Fargo. At no cost to the company, its corporatelibrary is now open more than seven hours longer each weekbecause employees have juggled their workloads and hours tomeet family and other personal needs. Some workers startlater and stay later, while others work longer days inexchange for time off on other days. . . .
