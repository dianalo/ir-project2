Critics of current auditing practices, including some congressmen, said the new standards don't go far enough. &quot;There is real progress . . . but we still aren't there yet,&quot; said Rep. Ron Wyden (D., Ore.).    The new rules, adopted by the Auditing Standards Board of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, for the first time specifically charge auditors to look for fraud. The rules, which generally become effective next Jan. 1, mean an auditor must &quot;design the audit to provide reasonable assurance of detecting errors and irregularities that are material,&quot; said Dan M. Guy, vice president for auditing at the institute.    Possible misdeeds then would be brought to the attention of the audited company's board.    The new provisions on fraud are part of the most sweeping redesign ever of the auditing standards, which were introduced in 1939. Among other changes, accountants now are specifically required to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about the company's ability to continue as &quot;a going concern.&quot; Such doubt, when it exists, would have to be disclosed.    In the past, Mr. Guy said, the auditor only addressed the going-concern issue if he or she had suspicions the company might fail to survive.    In another change that will be visible in thousands of corporate annual reports next year, the Auditing Standards Board also altered the language of the auditor's opinion. To clear up what the institute says are widespread misunderstandings, the auditor's report will specify that the financial statements are the representation of management, not the auditors.    But, addressing the fraud issue, the opinion will go on to say that the audit was performed &quot;to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatements.&quot;    Some critics, including Rep. Wyden, believe auditors need to report their suspicions or findings of corporate fraud to the Securities and Exchange Commission or law enforcement officials. Telling the company's board &quot;doesn't do anything&quot; if directors are involved in the fraud, said a staff member for the House Energy and Commerce Committee's oversight and investigations subcommittee. That body last month held hearings on auditor performance that focused on the fraud-linked collapse of ZZZZ Best Co. last summer.    In another matter, the institute's Auditing Standards Board reviewed a proposed interpretation that would prohibit accountants from the lucrative practice of giving so-called solvency letters to banks and other lenders. These letters assure lenders that a company loading up with debt is solvent and probably will remain so in the near future. Mr. Guy said the interpretation will become effective in the next few months, upon publication in an accounting journal.    ---   Lee Berton contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
