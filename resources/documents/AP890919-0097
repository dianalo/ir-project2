An official reported at least 25 dead.   Hugo hit northeastern Puerto Rico and then skirted its populousnorthern coast on Monday. It roared on to the northwest and towardopen water, its hurricane-force winds missing the Dominican Republic.   At noon EDT today, the hurricane's center was near latitude 22.2degrees north and longitude 68.5 west, about 175 miles eastnortheast of Grand Turk Island in the southern Bahamas, according tothe National Weather Service. Winds fell to 105 mph.   Forecasters said it likely would hit the U.S. mainland later inthe week but said it was too early to predict where. Cruise shipssteamed out of the way, residents prepared along the North Carolinacoast and Florida residents jammed the phone lines of insurancecompanies for financial protection.   ``It's a long way from any potential landfall,'' said Bob Sheets,director of the National Hurricane Center in suburban Coral Gables.``Unfortunately, the higher likelihood is that it will turn morewest and could make landfall anywhere from South Florida to NorthCarolina.''   At least 25 people in the Caribbean died from the storm, saidCizanette Rivera, a spokeswoman for the Civil Defense in Puerto Rico.   Maria Dolores Oronoz, a spokesman for Gov. RafaelHernandez-Colon, said only two people died on Puerto Rico. The twodied while trying to remove a TV antenna Sunday in preparation forthe storm, she said. She said no other deaths had been reported inPuerto Rico.   The National Weather Service in San Juan reported its preliminarystatement that said 25 had died on the U.S. commonwealth wasincorrect.   Ms. Rivera gave no breakdown on where the other reported victimshad died, but scattered fatalities were reported throughout theheavily visited tourist islands of the eastern Caribbean.   Hugo left a trail of smashed homes, power failures and injuriesin Guadeloupe, Montserrat, Antigua and the Virgin Islands sinceSunday, and widespread looting by machete-wielding mobs was reportedon the island of St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands.   Widespread evacuations apparently lessened the chance offatalities.   Sailboats were blown out of the water and thrown up to 150 feeton shore in St. Thomas, and some waterfront businesses havedisappeared.   ``We were all huddled together in the corridor when the wind tookoff the roof of the house,'' said 14-year-old Didier Gacoby-Kaoly ofGuadeloupe.   Cleanup efforts were under way today throughout Puerto Rico. Gov.Rafael Hernandez-Colon said at least 27,900 people were lefthomeless and asked President Bush to declare it a disaster area.   Hugo's winds overturned cars, peeled roofs off houses and officebuildings and sent chunks of concrete plunging into streets in SanJuan, where one-third of the U.S. commonwealth's 3.3 million peoplelive.   The winds ripped out glass, walls and furnishings from the topfour floors of a 25-story building in the Santurce section, leavingonly beams remaining.   Fifty airplanes were reported destroyed at the airport in IslaVerde. Looters stripped shops of their goods in San Juan.   Officials were working to restore power, which was cut to 75percent of the island.   Police cars with flashing lights patrolled San Juan streets earlytoday. Major streets were cleared, but secondary streets remainedclogged with power lines, tree limbs, sheets of metal and shatteredglass.   Flooding made many roads impassable, and internationalcommunications were disrupted.   In the northeast town of Luquillo, 10 homes were swept downriverand six families were reported missing, the weather service officesaid.   Civil Defense officials reported 80 percent of the homes on thePuerto Rican islands of Vieques and Culebra were were eitherdestroyed or damaged.   Secretary of the Interior Manuel Lujan said $500,000 in emergencyassistance funds were released to aid storm-stricken areas of PuertoRico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.   The weather service said maximum sustained winds had slowed tonear 105 mph with hurricane-force winds extending up to 60 milesfrom the center. It was moving to the northwest at 12 mph and wasexpected to continue in that direction during the next 24 hours.   A hurricane watch was in effect for the central Bahamas andtropical storm warnings for the southern Bahamas.   Since Sunday, the storm has caused widespread damage inGuadeloupe, Antigua, St. Kitts, Montserrat and the U.S. and BritishVirgin Islands.   Six people were killed and hundreds of buildings were flattenedon the British island of Montserrat, the British government saidtoday. It said nearly all of the 12,000 island residents werehomeless.   Britain reported the Royal Navy marines landed on Montserrat tohelp clear the airport runway so planes could deliver aid supplies.British Overseas Aid Minister Lynda Chalker said Britain wouldprovide $1.57 million in emergency aid to islands struck by thehurricane.   Five people were reported killed, 84 injured and about 15,000homeless on the French island of Guadeloupe. Two were killed inAntigua.   In Paris, the French Defense Ministry assigned 3,000 soldiers,two military transport aircraft and four cargo vessels to assist inrestoring communications and emergency services to Guadeloupe.French President Francois Mitterrand pledged to rebuild ``what wasdestroyed.''   Most of the Virgin Islands' 106,000 residents live on St. Thomasand St. Croix, where a ham radio operator said winds had torn offthe roofs of up to 75 percent of the homes.   Hugo is the fourth hurricane of the Atlantic hurricane season andis the most powerful hurricane to hit the region since HurricaneDavid in 1979.   That storm killed an estimated 1,200 people in the Caribbean andFlorida.   Tropical Storm Iris rose in the wake of Hugo and forecastersadvised residents of the battered Leeward Islands to keep a closewatch on the new storm. They said Iris, with 50 mph winds, was about300 miles east of the Leeward Islands Monday night and was movingnorth-northwest at about 18 mph.</TEXT></DOC>
