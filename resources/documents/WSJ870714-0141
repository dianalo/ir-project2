Wells Fargo Bank (news, June 11). Not only good farmers but also consumers will be the real losers if this precedent is upheld.    No one put Mr. Conlan's feet to the fire and forced him to accept a $9 million loan. Instead of a first-year $1 million profit, he produced an $800,000 loss, resulting in a $1.8 million swing in projected revenues. That ain't good farming! After an additional $1.5 million in loans and two years of defaulting on the loan payments, he was foreclosed on. And why not? Try skipping on your car or house payments for two years and see what happens. Mr. Conlan has learned to profitably farm the courts and the sympathy of jurors when he couldn't make a profit farming the soil.    With the Farm Credit Administration and Bank of America doing so poorly, why should Wells Fargo or any other lender loan money to farmers when a $9 million loan turns into a $60 million liability?
