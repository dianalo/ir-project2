The campaign still has three weeks to go, but Democrats are increasingly convinced they are about to lose the presidential race for the fifth time in the past 20 years.    Poor Michael Dukakis will become their latest scapegoat. Already his party-mates are complaining variously that Mr. Dukakis was an unappealing candidate, lacked a focused message and used TV badly. For years, liberal Democrats contended that their trouncings at Ronald Reagan's hands were solely cosmetic. But since George Bush is not the &quot;Great Communicator,&quot; Mr. Dukakis must be a lousy communicator. Everything is responsible except the Democratic Party or its dominant ideas.    The agony of the Democrats, though, is more than a run of bad luck. In the five presidential elections since 1968, after all, the party has managed to win only 42% of the votes. In retaining control of the House, its trump has been gerrymandering and incumbent-protection maneuvers that give lifetime tenure to Democrats elected under Truman, Kennedy and Johnson. And of course, Michael Dukakis is no accidental candidate; he won because the party's best candidates -- Senators Bill Bradley and Sam Nunn and Governors Chuck Robb and Mario Cuomo -- refused to take to the field.    All of this suggests the party's problems are profoundly structural. Indeed, the problem is simple. To win the nomination, a candidate has to take positions that make it impossible to win in the general elections. The special interests and activists who control the nomination are hopelessly out of touch with the majority of voters.    Take the social issues, which the activist Democrats say are somehow unfair to raise. Outside of places such as Cambridge and Georgetown, these are hot-button issues. Ask Tom Murphy, Democratic Speaker of the Georgia House, who earlier this month dumped the Dukakis campaign. At the Atlanta Convention, Mr. Murphy had been enthusiastic about the Democratic nominee, telling us &quot;Dukakis was a right smart fellow.&quot; Now a disillusioned Mr. Murphy says he is sitting out the election because of the Governor's views on gun control and the death penalty. &quot;My people are right opposite on those issues,&quot; Mr. Murphy told the Atlanta Journal. &quot;I've got to be with my people.&quot;    It was no accident that the two most damaging quotes of Michael Dukakis used by the Bush campaign -- &quot;I am a card-carrying member of the ACLU&quot; and &quot;I am a liberal, progressive Democrat&quot; -- were said in the hothouse Iowa primary. If they are not willing to appease feminists, labor-union leaders, gay-rights groups, government employees, teachers and a slew of other special interests, candidates need not apply.    Should it lose this November, the Democratic Party probably will move in one of two directions. One is to clearly rejoin the mainstream of American politics. That will, for starters, mean acknowledging that patriotic symbols such as the Pledge of Allegiance are important to most Americans, that much of the ACLU's policy agenda is simply bizarre, that American power may sometimes have to be used in a dangerous world, and that the American people do not want their taxes raised. Luckily, Democrats such as Messrs. Nunn, Bradley and Robb basically share those views.    The other option is for the party to continue buying off the activists in its midst, going the way of the British Labor Party -- becoming a group voters are unlikely to ever trust with executive power. Many of the people around Jesse Jackson are bent on precisely that. Andrew Kopkind, an associate editor of the Nation, explicitly avows &quot;a permanent progressive/populist 'tendency' within the Democratic Party,&quot; with the threat that if it doesn't &quot;get what it wants and deserves, it withdraws and wrecks the coalition.&quot;    Almost all of the Democratic House incumbents will win re-election this fall, of course, giving them a continuing big hand in policy debates. The Senate is more volatile, but there too Democrats look to keep control. But a Democratic Party still anchored to a U.S. version of Britain's &quot;loony left&quot; might even find its control of Congress threatened after redistricting in 1991.    In addition, the only national political prize is the White House, and any party that consistently fails to gain a majority for its program nationwide is in real trouble. Should Michael Dukakis lose, the fault will not lie with his personality or his campaign &quot;handlers,&quot; but rather with the party that nominated him and discouraged more credible, more mainline candidates. Democrats will have to ask how they can ever win if their party fails to reflect the values and beliefs of a majority of Americans. </TEXT></DOC>
