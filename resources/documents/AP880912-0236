(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Members of the United Auto Workers unionvoted overwhelmingly to authorize a strike against Caterpillar Inc.if necessary, but a UAW official said today the move is routineduring contract negotiations.   The members of UAW Local 974, which represents some 10,000Caterpillar workers in the Peoria area, voted Sunday in favor ofallowing their negotiators to call a strike if it is deemednecessary, said Stan Valentine, assistant director of the local'scommunity action program.   ``It passed our local by a tremendous amount, by like 95percent,'' Valentine said.   UAW members who work for Deere andamp; Co. also voted overwhelminglyover the weekend to authorize their negotiators to call a strike ifnecessary, said Bill Casstevens, the UAW's secretary-treasurer inDetroit.   Members of the UAW, which represents 13,500 active Deere workersand 3,500 laid-off workers, voted 95 percent in favor of the strikeauthorization, he said.   Deere officials and union negotiators began contract talks onAug. 3 and were scheduled to resume talks this week.   Valentine, of the Caterpillar local, said strike-authorizationvotes are ``something that's customarily done'' during contracttalks.   ``It gives the bargainers an edge knowing their people arebacking them,'' Valentine said. ``It does give our bargainers thefeeling that people are behind them and gives them theauthorization to call a strike if things don't work out and thetalks break down.''   Valentine said Local 974 represents about half of Caterpillar'sUAW workers nationwide. He said other locals also tookstrike-authorization votes, but that he wasn't certain of theresults.   Contract talks were continuing, Valentine said.</TEXT></DOC>
