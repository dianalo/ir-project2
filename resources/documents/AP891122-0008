Red Cross spokeswoman Marie Aude Lude said 17 foreigners weresafely evacuated in the evening following negotiations involvingthe Red Cross, the Roman Catholic Church and the rebels   She said no U.S. military personnel were among those freed.   ``All the people are over 30, and none of them looks like anAmerican soldier,'' she said. It was not known how many otherforeigners were still in the El Salvador Sheraton Hotel in thewestern part of the capital.   Knowledgeable diplomatic sources, who insisted on anonymity forsecurity reasons, said the Americans barricaded on the fourth floorof an annex to the Sheraton's main building and would spend thenight there. The eight were described as heavily armed Green Beretsfrom Fort Bragg, N.C.   A rebel spokesman in Washington listed 15 people he said hadbeen evacuated from the five-story annex: three U.S. militaryadvisers, five Israeli military advisers, one German citizen, fiveSalvadoran hotel workers and one Guatemalan military adviser.   The rebel spokesman, Salvador Sanabria, also said on ABC's``Nightline'' that rebel forces were fired upon by U.S. militaryadvisers. That could not be confirmed.   Col. Carlos Aviles, spokesman for El Salvador's military, toldthe news program from San Salvador that a Catholic clergyman actingas an intermediary had arranged for some foreigners to be evacuated.   Aviles said the military would seek to free those holed up inthe hotel on Wednesday.   The Americans were barricaded in one or two rooms and controlledthe fourth floor hallway, while the guerrillas were on the thirdand fifth floors.   The army moved tanks and hundreds of soldiers into the westernneighborhood of Escalon to fight the attackers, whose assaultrenewed an urban offensive that had appeared to be waning. About1,000 people have been killed since the offensive, the largest ofthe decade-old civil war, began the night of Nov. 11.   The Bush administration said the United States was ``makingplans as necessary'' to protect the lives of Americans. White Housespokesman Marlin Fitzwater said no options _ including militaryones _ were ruled out.   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said theSalvadoran armed forces rescued 20 hotel guests, including severalAmericans, from a part of the hotel not penetrated by guerrillas.No details were given.   The attack comes one day after President Bush reaffirmed strongU.S. support for President Alfredo Cristiani's rightist government.The United States has provided about $3.5 billion to oppose theinsurgency, in which about 71,000 people, mostly civilians, havedied. Fifty-five U.S. military advisers are assigned to El Salvador.   Soldiers from an armored personnel carrier earlier rescued thesecretary-general of the Organization of American States, who hadbeen in a different part of the Sheraton when the guerrillasmounted the attack.   Joao Baena Soares, the OAS chief, was evacuated from the hotel afew hours later without incident.   A government statement said the armed forces had foiled aguerrilla attempt to kidnap Baena Soares. He made no comment but aguard answering the phone at the OAS headquarters in Washingtonsaid late Tuesday that Baena Soares was ``OK and he's coming back(to Washington) tomorrow.''   Meanwhile, in an apparently unrelated incident, a U.S. Embassyofficer was slightly wounded Tuesday morning when he was struck bywhat was described as a stray bullet at his home in the Escalonneighborhood.   Embassy spokesman Jeff Brown said, ``It was completelyincidental. He was not on the scene at the time, he was notinvolved. He is the only American that was injured in any way todaythat we are aware of.''   Brown said the victim worked for the Agency for InternationalDevelopment, but there was no immediate identification available.   One of the six barricaded Americans seen by the AP toldreporters he had been talking with the rebels at one point and thatno shots had been fired, nor would they shoot unless fired upon.   ``We're here because we don't feel we can leave safely,'' saidthe soldier, who declined to provide his name.   Col. Carlos Aviles of the Salvadoran army said it was unclearhow many rebels remained on hotel grounds overnight.   One source said there were fears the rebels left behind mines orbooby-traps after slipping away.   The hotel manager told the AP by telephone there was stillsporadic firing around the building.   Journalists had to leave the area shortly before the overnightcurfew went into effect at 6 p.m.   State Department sources said Tuesday night that many of theguests trapped in the Sheraton, including several Americans, hadbeen allowed to leave the building in the custody of the Red Cross.   At 5:30 p.m. (6:30 p.m. EST), a half-hour before the curfew,Monsignor Gregorio Rosa Chavez, the Roman Catholic auxiliary bishopof San Salvador, arrived at the hotel for negotiations with theguerrillas.   He was accompanied by Francois Musy, head of the InternationalRed Cross office in El Salvador, and Monsignor Emil Stehe, thearchbishop of Ecuador who arrived in Salvador last week.   Rosa Chavez asked the army officer in charge of the troopsaround the hotel to withdraw the soldiers from the hotel groundsand he complied. The troops pulled back a half-block.   Rose Chavez was asked who would be evacuated and he said,``Everybody comes out.''   A U.S. source said the military men trapped in the raid on onewing of the Sheraton, which is no longer part of the U.S.-basedhotel chain, were on a two-week training mission and had beenscheduled to leave Tuesday.   The six men seen by the AP were in civilian dress and did notidentify themselves as U.S. officers, but carried M-16 rifles andspoke of having been in Vietnam and of the rules of engagement forU.S. advisers.   Citing the rules for U.S. military advisers, one described whathe and his companions did when the building came under attack.   ``We did not fire,'' he said. ``Those are the rules ofengagement. Unless we're fired upon, we don't fire.''   Hotel manager Robert Nieuwveld, who took refuge in anadministrative office with three employees, two guests and an APreporter, said about 12 U.S. citizens had been among about 20guests trapped in the rear when the guerrillas took it over.   The guerrillas issued a statement saying no one was being heldhostage.   ``The objective is to take Escalon,'' said a guerrilla in chargeof an insurgent position about 80 yards from the hotel. ``We'retaking Escalon because here the armed forces are not going tobombard people's homes. This is where the oligarchy lives.''</TEXT></DOC>
