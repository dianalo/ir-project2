In New York, oil, precious metals, coffee and copper closed lower, while cotton and cocoa posted modest gains. In Chicago, agricultural commodity markets were mixed, and stock-index and interest-rate futures prices moved in opposite directions.    Most trading in the oil market represented profit-taking after three days of strong gains. Crude oil futures at the New York Mercantile Exchange had risen $1.36 a barrel, or about 9%, since late last week. Most of the gain was in anticipation of or in reaction to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' agreement last weekend to cut production and try to return to a fixed price of about $18 a barrel.    Yesterday, the February crude oil contract price skidded 31 cents to $16.91 a barrel. &quot;It was a lackluster day, and some traders lost their enthusiasm&quot; for the OPEC agreement, said Peter Beutel, assistant energy director for Elders Futures Inc., New York.    Precious metals futures prices headed in the same direction as energy prices, with gold, platinum and silver all posting losses on sluggish volume. Traders said much of the activity was for technical reasons. In addition, one gold trader for a New York bank said, &quot;There's still an absence of bullion buying.&quot;    On the Commodity Exchange, gold contracts for December delivery fell $4.40 an ounce to $388.70; December silver prices slipped 7.4 cents to $5.293 an ounce. Platinum for January delivery closed on the New York Mercantile Exchange at $467.30, down $9.70 an ounce.    Many commodity markets will close early today, and many traders already have begun their holidays, brokers said. At all New York exchanges except the New York Futures Exchange, trading will stop at noon today. All those exchanges, including the New York Futures Exchange, will be closed tomorrow and Friday.    The Chicago Board of Trade will stop trading in all contracts except stock indexes at noon today; stock-index trading will close at 3:15 p.m. CST. The CBOT will open for its normal trading hours Friday. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange will be open for its normal trading hours both today and Friday.    But analysts and brokers said the markets probably will remain quiet until the new year. &quot;With the holidays, there's really no reason to do any trading,&quot; said William Byers, futures research director for Bear, Stearns andamp; Co., New York.    Cattle and hog futures prices moved up yesterday. Traders said Monday's 50-state hog and pig report may have added some support to the hog market that seemed to spill over into the cattle pit. However, weakness in the cash market may have tempered gains in hog futures, they said. Pork-belly prices were lower, and grain prices fell as well, as the holiday doldrums settled into the market.    Stock-index futures fell in light trading as some investors unloaded holdings to avoid next year's higher tax on capital gains.    &quot;It was mostly individuals selling,&quot; said Jeffrey Tabak, a general partner of Miller Tabak Hirsch andamp; Co., New York. March futures on the Standard andamp; Poor's 500 index fell 1.40 points to 247.40. Treasury bond and currency futures rose in fairly thin, uneventful trading.
