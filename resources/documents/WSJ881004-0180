The drop in color TV exports followed a 15.1% increase in July, which was preceded by a string of declines that began in February. A total of 355,511 color TV sets were exported in August. Exports to the U.S. fell 74%, to 15,972 sets.    VTR exports totaled 1.82 million units. The U.S., still the largest importer of Japan VTRs, bought 780,071 units, down 23%. The U.S. imports accounted for 43% of the total in the month.    Overall, exports of both color TVs and VTRs continued to reflect the effects of the dollar's decline against the yen since the Group of Seven major industrial nations began to guide the U.S. currency downward following the Plaza Accord of 1985.    Japanese manufacturers have had a harder time exporting to their mainstay markets in North America since the dollar's decline, which forced them to raise prices or accept lower profits. </TEXT></DOC>
