The company said it also is creating a fee-based &quot;end-user&quot; services organization aimed largely at upgrading support for its Macintosh business systems.    That organization will operate as a separate business unit within Apple and focus on providing installation and service for &quot;large, complex&quot; Macintosh networks and related systems, an Apple spokeswoman said. Apple expects the unit to become &quot;a significant revenue generator&quot; though it declined to estimate its potential income.    Cupertino, Calif.-based Apple said its reorganization is aimed at building a marketing structure &quot;adaptable enough to keep pace with our anticipated growth.&quot; In the past four years, Apple has gone from being primarily a supplier of home computers to an increasingly large player in the business computer market. Revenue has risen more than 75% since 1984 to $2.66 billion for the fiscal year ended Sept. 25, 1987.    &quot;I consider this (reorganization) a natural evolution of things,&quot; says Charles R. Wolf, an analyst with First Boston Corp. &quot;They've been growing by leaps and bounds&quot; and have recognized that their various markets &quot;are distinctly different&quot; and require different expertise.    Apple's decision to split its international operations to focus on Europe and Asia separately &quot;in many ways parallels what you see&quot; at International Business Machines Corp. and other companies that have similarly based operations, adds Norman DeWitt, an analyst with Dataquest Inc., a San Jose, Calif., technology market research concern.    Analysts praised Apple's decision to form its end-user services unit. The company's long-term aspirations in the business market will likely depend on a sense from users that &quot;they can get support from the company&quot; and not simply rely on the local vendor, says Mr. DeWitt. &quot;We asked long ago how they planned to address this issue and this seems to be the answer.&quot;    In its marketing reorganization, Apple said it will create an Apple USA division from what formerly was known as U.S. Sales and Marketing. The division will segment its operations into a separate business-market unit; an education market unit, and a marketing and support unit. The division also will create three geographical units known as its Eastern, Central and Western marketing operations.    Apple's international division will split into Apple Europe and Apple Pacific. Apple Europe will concentrate on markets in France, West Germany and Scandinavia and also will oversee Apple's first regional research and development center, in Paris. The center will help Apple concentrate on specialized European market needs, the company said. Apple Pacific will focus on Apple's current markets in Canada, Australia and Japan while investigating &quot;emerging markets&quot; in Pacific Rim and Latin America nations.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Apple shares closed at $40.75, down $1. </TEXT></DOC>
