By the end of the week the government wasn't any closer to asolution to what everyone agrees will be the biggest federal bailoutin history at a time the country can least afford it, given a budgetdeficit of $150 billion. Bush told congressional lawmakers anyrescue plan ``will not be popular.''   The underlying acrimony in the crisis afflicting many of thenation's 3,000 Sandamp;Ls seemed to turn uglier with each passing day inWashington, where much of the feuding took place over how theirrescue should be financed.   The General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress,told lawmakers that federal regulators were wrong to rush into arash of deals late last year with promises of billions of dollars inassistance and guarantees to buyers of broke, badly managed savingsandamp; loan institutions.   The GAO recommended the government seize all remaining insolventSandamp;Ls to isolate them from the healthy part of the industry.   In addition, GAO Comptroller General Charles Bowsher released areport suggesting several accounting firms inexplicably failed toreport staggering loan problems at troubled Southwestern thrifts,contributing to what some lawmakers called a massive coverup.   At least one congressional critic of the government's handling ofthe crisis, Rep. Henry Gonzalez, T-Texas, said he had asked theJustice Department to explore taking unspecified civil actionagainst the errant accountants.   At the same time, the first notable Bush gaffe in his 2-week-oldpresidency _ suggesting Sandamp;L deposits could be taxed to subsidize thebailout effort _ not only refused to die but snowballed into aserious political problem that raised new questions about hisjudgment.   Some lawmakers said they were inundated with constituent maildenouncing the Bush idea. Reports surfaced nationwide thatdepositors were withdrawing their money from both sick and healthySandamp;Ls to avoid the risk of a tax.   Bush's chief of staff John Sununu, meanwhile, fired off his owncritical barrage directed at the banking industry overadvertisements run in three states that he said were designed toraise thrift-depositor doubts about the sanctity of their savings.He called the ads ``unequivocally irresponsible.''   The American Bankers Association lobby group rejected Sununu'soutrage over the ads, which ran in Kansas, Texas and Arkansas, wherethe Sandamp;L crisis has been acutely felt. The ABA countered that it hasalways maintained banks are more secure than Sandamp;Ls and that historyis bearing the claim out.   ``It is a very sensitive issue for bankers who have been undersiege for years now by some bankrupt savings and loans who aretrying to compete with below-market rates,'' said Mary-Liz Meany, anABA spokeswoman.   In other business and economic news this past week:   _The government released reports that showed January unemploymentrose slightly, while in December, factory orders surged, personalincome and spending both climbed at the same rate and a keyforecasting gauge jumped. Analysts remained divided over whether thedata evidenced a slowdown or higher inflation ahead.   _Market corruption crackdowns spread from Chicago and New York toother big cities targeted by a special Justice Department taskforce. At the same time, Chicago futures-exchange officialsintensified a self-policing effort in the aftermath of an FBIbugging operation said to expose rampant fraud.   _More fallout hit Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. as a result of itsagreement to plead guilty to securities fraud charges related to theIvan Boesky insider trading scandal, this time from New Jerseygambling authorities who moved to sever the firm's ties to theAtlantic City casino business. Kidder Peabody andamp; Co., another bigfirm that paid a big fine a few years ago because of the scandal andhas been struggling since, was hit by a spate of resignations.   _General Motors Corp. announced the indefinite shutdown of aplant in Framingham, Mass., an indication the giant automaker isstill trying to cut operations despite claims of a turnaround.Chrysler Corp., meanwhile, announced an agreement to market Hyundaicars in the United States, becoming the last big U.S. automaker todevelop direct ties to a Korean counterpart.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Weekend Editions Feb. 4-5</NOTE></DOC>
