(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Peter Kiewit Sons' Inc. on Friday scrappedan agreement to sell Continental Can Europe to Ball Corp. becauseof what the companies called a lack of bank financing that theyblamed on recent market turmoil.   The tentative sale was announced in July. Ball said it wasacquiring 33 European metal packaging plants from Continental Can,which would have given it a foothold in one of the world's mostrapidly expanding markets.   Continental was to have received $625 million in cash and $400million in stock, giving it a 29 percent stake in Ball, thefifth-largest producer of beer and soft drink cans in the UnitedStates.   But the plug was pulled on Friday, the companies said in a jointstatement. ``On a financial and operating basis, both Ball and CCEhave been performing at record levels in 1990. Unfortunately, duein major part to the recent turmoil in world financial markets, andin particular the U.S. banking community, Ball has not yet arrangedfinancing, and the certainty of closing the transaction on theagreed upon terms and time frame have become compromised,'' thestatement said.   The scrapped deal comes against a background of growingreluctance by commercial banks to make loans as economic growth hasslowed and a crisis persists in the Persian Gulf, which has drivenup oil prices and further weakened the U.S. economy.   Most of the top commercial banks in the United States havereported sharply lower earnings recently because of rising defaultson existing loans, particularly to Third World countries andcommercial real estate projects.   Ball still plans to acquire the remaining interest in its 50percent-owned Ball-InCon Glass Packaging Corp. joint venture. Inthat deal, also announced in July and due to be completed by theend of the year, Ball will pay $65 million in cash to its jointventure partner, Holland-American Investment Corp.   The Continental Can purchase was designed to help the companyenter the fastly growing European market. Ball is a major cansupplier to the cola giants, and Ball Chairman Richard M. Ringoensaid his company hoped to ride their coattails into Eastern Europe.   Coca-Cola Co. receives 25 percent of its soft drink cans inEurope from Continental, a privately held business of Peter KiewitSons of Omaha, Neb.   Continental Can Europe, which employs 10,000 people, had salesof $1.47 billion in 1989 and projects sales this year to grow to$1.66 billion. The company makes food, beverage and general metalcontainers, metal closures and plastic containers.   Last year, Ball reported 63.9 percent of its sales came frompackaging products. Combined packaging sales of Ball, ContinentalCan Europe and Ball-InCon last year would have been $2.78 billion,the company said.</TEXT></DOC>
