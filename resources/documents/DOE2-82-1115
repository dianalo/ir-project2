But there would be newenvironmental problems in connection with this. The invention providesfor mixing an additive containing carbon with the oil sluries and themixture is then pressed into shape. These shapes are then gasified andthe process gas is completely converted into flue gas with controlledcracking and combustion. The flue gas can finally be taken to a deviceto use its heat.</TEXT></DOC>
