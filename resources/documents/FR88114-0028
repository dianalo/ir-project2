Background</ITAG>The Defense Acquisition Regulatory Council is considering a proposed revisionto the DoD FAR Supplement Part 232. The proposed rule prescribes the policiesand procedures for incorporating milestone billing arrangements into certainlong-term defense contracts. This contract financing method was previouslyauthorized in the Defense Acquisition Regulation under Appendix E. Whenthe Defense Acquisition Regulation was superseded in March 1984, however,the provision for milestone billings was not included in the Federal AcquisitionRegulation because it was regarded as DoD-unique. It was not included inthe DoD Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement because, at that time,the customary progress payment rate was relatively high (i.e., 90%) andDoD had implemented a flexible progress payment method.Action to reinstate milestone billing arrangements is being taken in conjunctionwith other reforms to DoD's profit and contract financing policies. A recentDoD study, called the ``Defense Financial and Investment Review'' (DFAIR),recommended use of milestone billing arrangements on long-term contractsthat had few delivery payments. DFAIR found that such contracts had anabnormally higher inventory carrying cost because they presented minimumopportunity for contractors to receive payment for costs not covered byprogress payments. Furthermore, since interest expenses are not allowableon defense contracts and must be absorbed in the profit margin, the profitabilityof these long-term contracts was substantially diminished. With the reductionin the customary progress payment rate of 80% in 1985 and to 75% in 1986,the need for this type of supplemental contract financing is apparent.<ITAG tagnum="84">B. Regulatory Flexibility Act Information</ITAG>The proposed rule will not impact small business concerns. Milestone billingarrangements will be restricted to large, long-term contracts with fewcontract deliveries. Small business concerns already receive special considerationin the progress payments policies (i.e., higher customary progress paymentrate, less restrictive application criteria, incurred cost basis).<ITAG tagnum="84">C. Paperwork Reduction Act Information</ITAG>The Paperwork Reduction Act (Pub. L. 96-511) does not apply because theproposed rule does not impose any new information collection requirements.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 48 CFR Parts 232 and 252</ITAG>Government procurement.<ITAG tagnum="6">Charles W. Lloyd,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Executive Secretary, Defense Acquisition Regulatory Council.</ITAG>Therefore, it is proposed that 48 CFR Parts 232 and 252 be amended as follows:1. The authority citation for 48 CFR Parts 232 and 252 continues to readas follows: <ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>5 U.S.C. 301, 10 U.S.C. 2202, DoD Directive 5000.35,and DoD FAR Supplement 201.301. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">PART 232_CONTRACT FINANCING </ITAG>2. A new Subpart 232.70, consisting of sections 232.7000 through 232.7007,is added to read as follows: <ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart 232.70_Milestone Billing Arrangements </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">232.7000 Milestone billing arrangements. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">232.7001 Criteria for use. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">232.7002 Milestone events. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">232.7003 Milestone values. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">232.7004 Contract administration. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">232.7005 Consideration. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">232.7006 Approval procedures. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">232.7007 Contract clause. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart 232.70_Milestone Billing Arrangements </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">232.7000 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Milestone billing arrangements. </ITAG>(a) A milestone billing arrangement is a supplementary contract financingprovision for making interim payment to a contractor for work accomplishedwhich does not involve physical delivery to the Government. The arrangementconsists of milestone events, milestone values, and a contract administrationplan. (b) Milestone billings are contract financing payments which supplementpayments made under the Progress Payments clause. They are not invoicepayments for supplies delivered or services performed by the contractor.(c) Milestone arrangements are subject to the administrative provisionsof the Progress Payments clause. They are liquidated against invoice paymentsfor contract line items upon which milestone billings were made. They arealso recoverable in a manner similar to progress payments in the eventof default. <ITAG tagnum="80">232.7001 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Criteria for use. </ITAG>(a) A milestone billing arrangement may be granted, under the approvalprocedures prescribed in 232.7006, on contracts which meet all of the followingcriteria: (1) Contract includes the Progress Payments clause; (2) Contract price exceeds $50 million; (3) Period of contract performance exceeds four years; (4) Contractor deliveries to the Government do not commence until 24 monthsafter the start of the period of performance; (5) Actual costs incurred for each milestone event can be completely segregated;and (6) Adequate consideration is received from the contractor (see 232.7005).(b) A milestone billing arrangement may not be granted if the contractprovides for flexible progress payments (see 232.501(S-711)) or if thecontract provides for advance payments or unsual progress payments. <ITAG tagnum="80">232.7002 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Milestone events. </ITAG>(a) Milestone events shall be based on significant work to be accomplishedin fulfilling contract requirements. Each event shall be severable as acontract line item or subline item and completely verifiable. Examplesof milestone events might include the following: (1) Completion of a significant engineering task; (2) Manufacture of special tooling or equipment; (3) Site preparation; and (4) Completion of a subassembly. (b) Milestone events may not be based on insignificant task, administrativefunctions, percentage of completion estimates, or passage of time. Examplesof unacceptable milestone events include the following: (1) Attendance at meetings; (2) Submission of program status or financial reports; (3) Placement of orders to vendors or subcontractors; and (4) Capital expenditures. (c) Milestone events may not be established to occur for the first 12 monthsof a contract's period of performance and may not occur more frequentlythan every three months. (d) Milestone events should not be established to take place after commencementof contract deliveries.<ITAG tagnum="80">232.7003 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Milestone values.</ITAG>(a) A milestone value shall be established for each milestone event. Thevalue shall be the estimated cost for the work accomplished.(b) Cost estimates shall comply with the applicable cost accounting standardsand contract cost principles prescribed by regulation.(c) A milestone value shall not include profit.<ITAG tagnum="80">232.7004 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Contract administration.</ITAG>(a) A milestone billing arrangement must include a contract administrationplan. This plan must clearly describe the work to be accomplished underthe milestone events, their corresponding values, and the documentationand procedures for making payment. Each milestone event and value shallbe related to deliverable end items in the contract. This relationshipwill be identified in the contract administration plan through a matrixsimilar to the example shown below. The matrix is necessary to ensure thatmilestone payments are properly liquidated against subsequent invoice payments.A milestone event may not relate to more than one contract line item. However,a contract line item may have more than one relatable milestone event,as shown in the example.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>5,L2,i1,s10,5,5,5,5</C><T4>Example</T4>: <T4>Milestone Billing Matrix</T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Dollar amounts in millions]</ITAG><H1>Milestone</H1><H1>Milestone value by contract line item</H1><H2>1</H2><H2>2</H2><H2>3</H2><H2>Total</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">1<D>$5</D><D>_</D><D>_</D><D>$5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2<D>_</D><D>$6</D><D>_</D><D>6</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">3<D>_</D><D>4</D><D>_</D><D>4</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">4<D>_</D><D>_</D><D>$15</D><D>15</D><R>n,sandCx.3;</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">Total values</ITAG><D>5</D><D>10</D><D>15</D><D>30</D><ITAG tagnum="1">Line item prices<D>10</D><D>20</D><D>40</D><D>70</D></ITAG></ITAG>(b) Milestone billing requests shall be submitted by the contractor tothe contracting officer in accordance with the contract administrationplan. The contracting officer should obtain an audit of the milestone billingrequest from the contract auditor. Prior to making payment to the contractor,the contracting officer will verify that work performed under the milestoneevent has been satisfactorily accomplished. This verification does notconstitute Government acceptance of the work performed.(c) The milestone billing amount shall be lesser of (1): The milestonevalue or (2) the actual allowable costs incurred for completing the milestoneevent. The contractor's payment is to be reduced by progress payments madeto the contractor for the milestone event. This adjustment does not representa liquidation of progress payments; it only determines the amount of supplementarycontract financing. Milestone payment based on cumulative milestone valuesor cumulative actual costs incurred is prohibited (i.e., a favorable costvariance on one milestone event may not be used to offset an unfavorablecost variance on another). Examples of computing milestone payments areshown below:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,b2,tp9,p8,8/9,i1,s10,6,6</C><T4>Example</T4>: <T4>Milestone Payment Computation</T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Dollar amounts in millions]</ITAG><H1> </H1><H1>Example 1</H1><H1>Example 2</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Milestone value<D>$20</D><D>$20</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Actual cost incurred<D>24</D><D>16</D><R>n,dandCx.3;</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Milestone billing<D>20</D><D>16</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Progress payments\1\<D>18</D><D>12</D><R>n,sandCx.3;</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">Milestone payment</ITAG><D>2</D><D>4</D><F>\1\ At 75% of actual costs incurred.</F></ITAG>(d) Milestone payments shall be liquidated against contractor invoicesfor relatable line items delivered. The invoice payment shall be firstreduced by the liquidation of progress payments in the manner requiredunder the Progress Payments clause. The remaining amount is then reducedby the milestone payments. This sequence is necessary to liquidate thesecontract financing payments properly. The matrix included in the contractadministration plan will guide such liquidation actions.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L0,tp9,p8,8/9,g1,t1,i1,s30,8</C><T4>Example</T4>: <T4>Milestone Payment Liquidation</T4><H1> </H1><H1/><T3>Millions</T3><ITAG tagnum="1">Price of item delivered<D>$40</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Progress payments liquidated<D>30</D><R>n,s</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">Delivery payment before adjustment</ITAG><D>10</D><ITAG tagnum="1">Milestone payments on item delivered<D>5</D><R>n,s</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">Delivery payment</ITAG><D>5</D></ITAG>(e) Milestone values may not be revised under the ``Adjustment of Payments''provisions of an Incentive Price Revision clause in fixed-price incentivecontracts. Further, milestone values may not be adjusted pursuant to anyEconomic Price Adjustment clause.<ITAG tagnum="80">232.7005 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Consideration.</ITAG>Milestone billing arrangements supplement progress payments; therefore,separate consideration is required. The value of the consideration mustbe adequate in view of the Government's costs in providing the supplementalfinancing.Where the Weighted Guidelines Method is used, milestone billing eventsshall be equated to contract deliveries in determining the working capitaladjustment (215.970-1(b)(4)).<ITAG tagnum="80">232.7006</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Approval procedures.</ITAG>(a) Milestone billing arrangements shall be approved by the Service/Agencyofficial responsible for the comptroller function. This authority may bedelegated to a senior level official within the comptroller function.(b) A contractor's request for a milestone billing arrangement will beforwarded to the designated approval authority in the manner establishedby each Service/Agency. As a minimum, the request for approval should containthe following:(1) Contractor's request for the milestone billing arrangement and supportingrationale;(2) Proposed contract administration plan;(3) Cost analysis of the milestone value of each milestone event;(4) Recommendation of the contracting officer.(c) The contracting officer shall not include a milestone billing arrangementin a contract award, even conditionally, unless requisite approval hasbeen obtained.(d) The contracting officer shall not include a provision for milestonebilling arrangements in any solicitation.<ITAG tagnum="80">232.7007</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Contract clause.</ITAG>(a) Individual milestone events shall be incorporated into a contract asseparate contract line items or subline items.(b) The contracting officer shall insert the Milestone Billing Arrangementclause at 252.232-7008 when milestone billing arrangements have been approvedfor use under 232.7006.<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 252_SOLICITATION PROVISIONS AND CONTRACT CLAUSES</ITAG>3.
