 By July, Integrated Automation plans to begin writing anestimated 200,000 lines of code for the three-phase project.andM;The first installation of what Boeing is calling the Reference EngineeringData Automated Retrieval System (REDARS) is scheduled to be completed byearly 1991 at the Renton, Wash., site, where Boeing 737s and 757s aremanufactured.andP;  A fabrication plant in Auburn, Wash., should be on line by theend of 1991, and in early 1992 an Everett, Wash., facility producing 747s and767s will join the system.andM;FDDI networksandM;With a backlog of 1,100 aircraft on order, and airline safety a visiblepublic concern, Boeing hopes REDARS will improve productivity and quality andcut costs significantly, says Norm Eddy, manager of systems support forBoeing's commercial opeations.andM;The massive project involves an FDDI (fiber distributed data interface)network at each site.andP;  The FDDI backbone, capable of transmitting at 100Mbytes per second, ties together several distributed subsystems at a givenplant, including image input, optical storage, database management, on-siteand offsite viewing workstations and a batch printing station.andM;The network architecture is triply redundant.andP;  That is, individual plantswith systems like the one described above will be connected to each otherthrough T1 communications links.andP;  Should part of an individual network failat one plant, engineers would still be able to access duplicate drawingsstored at one of the two other manufacturing sites.andM;REDARS will rely heavily on write once read many (WORM) optical disk drivejukeboxes, as well as magnetic disk subsystems that will act as caching unitsto speed access.andM;According to Alan Davis, division manager of Integrated Automation, theinitial installation in Renton alone will have 22 jukeboxes packed with5-1/4-inch drives.andP;  Total capacity is estimated at 500G bytes.andP;  In all, morethan 2 million drawings nd other documents will be on line for use by Boeingpersonnel in engineering, manufacturing and purchasing departments.andM;Boeing and Integrated Automation are tight-lipped about the dollar value ofthe contract.andP;  However, according to Optical Memory News, an industrynewsletter, the deal will be worth more than $25 million over three years.andM;Since 1975, Integrated Automation has sold digital image-management equipmentand systems integration services to a number of Fortune 100 companies, suchas General Electric Co., Mobil Oil Corp., Pratt andamp; Whitney and Westinghouse.andO;The company also installed a document-management system at the Library ofCongress.andP;  Besides pioneering the use of optical jukeboxes, IntegratedAutomation also invented an aperture-card scanner for digitizing 35mmmicrofiche slides.andM;For companies like Boeing, apertture cards--IBM punch cards with an embeddedslide--have been the storage medium of choice, but they aren't withoutproblems.andM;&quot;On a long Boeing production line, it's no trivial task getting a copy of awing drawing,&quot; says Davis.andP;  &quot;You wait in line for the card, get a print, thenmaybe find out you got the wrong one.&quot;andM;Out-of-date drawings are another problem.andP;  Manual card systems open up thepossibility that obsolete drawings could be used to make a subassembly or tobuild a part.andP;  A recent malfunction on a Boeing airliner involving crossedwires speaks to the complexity of constant revisions as an aircraft designchanges over the years.andM;New drawings can be directly imported into the new storage system fromBoeing's CAD equipment.andP;  A database management system will keep only currentrevisions on line, while outdated copies will stay in backup to provide anaudit trail.andM;While Boeing is generally considered an IBM Corp. shop, REDARS will not betied strictly to Big Blue.andM;&quot;It was planned as an open system for maximum flexibility,&quot; says Boeing'sEddy, and standards will rule: FDDI and Ethernet for data transport, UNIX forworkstation subsystem control, TCP/IP for communications and ISO 8613 fordocument definition.andM;REDARS is also distributed: No single mainframe processes the images.andP;  Forexample the largest processor in the system will be a VAX 6220 from DigitalEquipment Corp.andP;  Using an indexed, sequential file system built with DECprogramming tools, the 6220 will act only as a document directory, showingwhere a drawing is located on the network by sector, platter or disksubsystem.andP;  When a user makes a request, the system searches the closestplace on the network in terms of communications time.andP;  If it isn't there, thesearch widens to the next furthest location.andP;  The last place it would lookwould be on the jukebox.andM;At this point Boeing and Integrated Automation are still in the process ofselecting equipment.andP;  A number of jukebox vendors are under consideration.andO;While capacity will be an issue, it won't be as important as how fast arobotic arm can fetch a disk and load it into a drive, says Davis.andM;One decision has almost been made, Davis says.andP;  The nearly 600 workstationswith 19-inch monitors--and the file servers they're attached to--will comefrom either DEC or Sun Microsystems Inc. They could include Sun's RISC-basedSPARC systems, or Digital's new DECstation 3100.andM;&quot;The main concern is vendor support and direction,&quot; says Davis.andP;  &quot;Theworkstations you see today aren't the ones that will be around [in] threeyears when this is complete.andP;  Boeing wants a broad and stable software basefor this project.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
