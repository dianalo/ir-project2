(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Prosecutors today showed videotapes of JimBakker assuring viewers he's ``not here to make money'' as theysought to portray the TV evangelist as a big spender whose moneycame from believers who could hardly make ends meet.   ``This is a deal of a lifetime,'' Bakker said in an 1986broadcast played in court. ``There are no fees. This is not aprofit-making organization.''   Bakker was offering a new program that promised $500 donors threedays and two nights' lodging in 16-unit facilities called bunkhouses. Only one bunk house was completed when Bakker quit theevangelical empire in 1987.   ``We're not here to make money,'' Bakker said in anothervideotape. ``I hope my critics wake up and realize I'd be a fool ifI tried to make money off something like this.''   The prosecutions contends that Bakker used PTL funds raised for``partnerships'' to live in high style. PTL ``partners'' wereguaranteed lodging at the ministry's hotels.   According to evidence, in September 1986, after Bakker had sold34,000 bunkhouse memberships, PTL builder Roe Messner sent him amemo agreeing to reduce the number of bunkhouses from six to three.   In six hours of tapes of Bakker's ``The PTL Club'' shown Tuesday,Bakker appealed for donations and asked his followers to trust him.   ``I'm sincere,'' Bakker told viewers in 1984. ``I would not lieto you about anything.''   But over and over, prosecutor Deborah Smith halted the tape toask FBI agent John Pearson to compare Bakker's statements tobehind-the-scenes testimony about Bakker's television ministry.   In a 1984 videotape, Bakker urged his audience to pay forpartnerships with a credit card, saying he bought his with a creditcard because he didn't have any cash. The same year, prosecutorssaid, Bakker received $1 million in salary and bonuses and bought aPalm Desert, Calif., home and a Rolls-Royce.   Bakker is accused of diverting more than $3.7 million in PTLmoney raised from the partnership sales to pay for personalluxuries. If convicted of the 24 counts against him, he could besentenced to 120 years in prison and fined more than $5 million.   Pearson testified that from 1984 through 1986, Bakker repeatedlymisled viewers about how many donors, or ``lifetime partners,'' hadtaken part in the program, which offered three nights' lodging eachyear for life in return for $1,000.   At first, Bakker exaggerated the number of partnerships PTL hadissued, apparently to project a sense of urgency, Pearson said.   Later, the FBI agent said, Bakker understated the tally anddidn't acknowledge that he had exceeded his own ceiling andendangered the partners' chances of using their lodging privileges.   Earlier in the trial, prosecutors put on the stand several PTLpartners _ including the wife of a retired coal miner suffering fromblack lung disease and living on disability pay _ who testified theybought partnerships but could not get rooms.   Others have testified that partnerships were oversold and thatthe money from such promotions often was used to cover PTL'sday-to-day operating costs rather than finance construction of theguaranteed rooms and buildings.   Pearson said more than 66,000 partnerships were sold to viewersby the time Bakker left PTL in March 1987, despite a publicizedlimit of 25,000.   Bakker didn't watch much of the videotapes. He scribbled notesand looked through documents.</TEXT></DOC>
