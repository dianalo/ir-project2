Bello,general counsel to the U.S. Trade Representative.   She was testifying before the House Ways and Means Committee'ssubcommittee on international trade.   ``We must show we're not a scofflaw,'' Rep. Sam Gibbons, D-Fla.,agreed. He is chairman of the subcommittee and a major force intrade policy.   The accord is the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT),which has nearly 100 governments as members. The GATT organizationsponsors the ``Uruguay round'' negotiations in which the U.S.government has been trying unsuccessfully for a long-term agreementon ending subsidies to farmers. These subsidies cost consumers andtaxpayers tens of billions of dollars a year.   Ms. Bello said the rules she wants changed are more importantthan they seem because there are widespread doubts among othernegotiators about U.S. intentions.   At issue in Tuesday's hearing was a tax on imports of petroleumand some petroleum products passed by Congress in 1986 to helpfinance a ``superfund'' for cleaning up toxic waste. The tax onimported products was 11.7 cents a barrel, 3.5 cents more than thetax on U.S. production of the same items.   In June 1987, an international panel ruled that the differencewas a discrimination against other countries and a violation ofGATT. Other governments threatened to retaliate against the UnitedStates. To avoid that, the Reagan administration offered tonegotiate compensation with the countries affected. There have beentalks with Canada, Mexico and the 12 countries represented by theEuropean Economic Community, but no conclusion has been reached.   The community estimates that the tax costs its member countries$26.6 million a year. Ms. Bello said it would be preferable to getrid of the differential.   Also at issue is a ``user fee'' for work done by the U.S. CustomsService, based on the value of products imported. Anotherinternational panel ruled that also was a violation of the accord,which says such fees should be based on actual cost to the CustomsService.   According to Ella Krucoff, press officer for the EuropeanCommunity in Washington, its members paid $22.2 million in such feesin 1987.   ``The U.S. fee must be revised to tie it more closely to theactual cost of processing particular entries,'' Ms. Bello said.   The program brought in $787 million last year, according to HarryW. Carnes, director of the U.S. Customs Service User Fee Task Force.</TEXT></DOC>
