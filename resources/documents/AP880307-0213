Long the bane of Western farmers, the coyote has migratedEast, filling an ecological niche created by elimination of a farless destructive predator _ the wolf.</TEXT><BYLINE>By BOB DVORCHAK</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BRAVE, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The first sheep was killed on Earl Cole's farmlast March, then another, and another, and another. Within 10months, at least 80 lambs and ewes worth $10,000 were slain on hisfarm and an adjoining one.   Predatory teeth tore the sheeps' throats or pierced theirskulls, and their soft inner organs were eaten. All clues point tocoyotes, an Old West predator whose numbers are growing in the East.   ``It's circumstantial evidence. Nobody's actually seen a coyotekill the sheep. But it pretty much has to be coyotes,'' says Cole,67, who tends 100 head of sheep on his 200-acre Greene County farm.   To convince skeptics, Cole paid a trapper $50 to prove thecoyotes existed.   Five females have been trapped or shot near the scene of thecrimes _ rolling pasture 60 miles south of Pittsburgh, as opposedto the high grassy plains of Wyoming or Montana.   That's good enough for Richard Belding, land management officerfor the Pennsylvania Game Commission, who calls the evidence``overwhelming'' and ``conclusive.''   Before 1980, only six cases of coyotes killing sheep had beenverified in Pennsylvania. The new run-ins with farmers are proofthe coyote, preceded by its mystique and villainous reputation, hasbrought its eerie yips and howls to new territory.   A cousin of the wolf and the dog, the coyote looks like a smallGerman shepherd with a fox-like head, pointed nose and bushy tailthat resembles a bottle brush.   The Eastern coyote has some wolf and dog genes, and the biggestones weigh 55 pounds. Its prairie-dwelling kin weighs about 30pounds.   Coyotes are cunning hunters, bearing no resemblance to thehapless cartoon character Wile E. Coyote, whose comical schemesalways backfire as he vainly chases a road runner.   Real coyotes feast on mice, rabbits, deer, carrion,grasshoppers, fruits and berries. They also kill lambs, calves,goats, chickens, geese, pigs, barnyard cats, llamas and otherdomestic livestock. Coyotes have pilfered watermelons on Californiafarms. In October, coyotes killed 48 flamingos in the Los AngelesZoo after keepers mistakenly left the birds' pen open.   Coyotes vanished from Pennsylvania 10,000 years ago during theIce Age. They began returning in the late 1890s when the practiceof clear-cutting the state's forest exterminated the wolf bydestroying its habitat. Coyotes thrive in open country.   ``They're filling an ecological niche created when we eliminatedthe wolf,'' says Dr. John George, a senior biologist at Penn StateUniversity. ``The coyote is very resourceful. People have tried topoison them and trap them. It's tough to get rid of every lastone.''   ``There are coyotes in every Eastern state,'' says HelenMcGinnis, who did her master's study on coyote populations at PennState. ``The populations are building up and will continue to buildup. I have a lot of admiration for them. They're intelligent.They're adaptable.''   Biologists believe coyotes migrated from the Great Plains in agiant arc north and east around the Great Lakes about 90 years ago.The route took them into Ontario, then south to New England, NewYork, Pennsylvania and Appalachia. Others pushed east from theplains, while some were imported to be hunted by wolfhounds andsportsmen, Ms. McGinnis says.   Each year, an estimated 1 million sheep, or 10 percent of thenational stock, are killed by predators, and coyotes account for 90percent of that, according to the USDA. The loss is valued at $70million.   ``It's our number one preventable loss. This is the singlelargest cost of production that we think is reversible,'' says DanMurphy, president of the Washington-based National Wool GrowersAssocation.   The number of sheep ranchers has dwindled from 225,000 in the1960s to 125,000, says Dr. Clair Terrill, former director of sheepresearch for the USDA. Nationally, the sheep population has fallenfrom 55 million during World War II to 10 million, says Terrill,who blames coyotes for much of the drop.   To promote the use of mutton, Idaho sheep farmers coined thisbumper sticker: ``Eat American Lamb, 5 Million Coyotes Can't BeWrong.''   Others are more blunt.   ``I only know one good coyote, and that's a dead coyote,'' saysRick Moore of Harrison County, Ohio, where farmers pay a bounty of$25.   Don Patterson, president of sheep growers association in GreeneCounty, Pa., calls coyotes ``a damned nuisance. They're takingmoney out of our pocket.''   The coyote has outsmarted and outlasted government attempts toshoot, trap and poison it into oblivion. In 1972, the governmentbanned poison baits on federal lands, partly because non-targetanimals were being killed.   In 1983, the government allowed farmers to use poison collars onsheep if they met two dozen restrictions to protect theenvironment. So far, the collars have been approved in Wyoming,Montana and Texas.   Wildlife groups say the coyote is unfairly maligned. Attacking asheep is a learned skill, and not all coyotes kill livestock. Mostavoid humans. They also keep mice populations in check.   ``Coyotes are opportunistic. They're not evil,'' says SusanHagood of Defenders of Wildlife, a Washington-based group with80,000 members nationwide. She says coyotes can be discouraged byguard dogs, electric fences, placing ewes in sheds when they lamband selective shooting or trapping of sheep killers.   ``It would be a waste of time, effort and money to try toeliminate them. The government spent millions of dollars and failedto eradicate the coyote. We would hate to see Eastern statesadopting Western philosophies and making the same mistakes,'' Ms.Hagood says.   Some states have studied the impact of coyotes on deerpopulations. In Maine, selective trapping eliminates troublesomecoyotes, but the animals are not significantly damaging the deerherd.   ``As far as I know, the coyote has not had any seriousrepercussions on native wildlife. It does not appear to be adisaster. If it is causing people problems, people have themselvesto blame,'' says Ronald Novak of the U.S. Department of Interior.   In Pennsylvania, where coyotes can be hunted or trappedyear-round, they number an estimated 2,000 to 3,000.   Says Arnold Hayden, a coyote expert with the Pennsylvania GameCommission, ``They're probably everywhere but downtown Philadelphiaand Pittsburgh.''</TEXT><NOTE>END ADV for Sunday, March 20</NOTE></DOC>
