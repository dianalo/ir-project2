One potential source of tax revenue could readily add an estimated $20 billion a year to the coffers and, more important, help to reduce an economic and human catastrophe that will persist if we do not act: the loss of thousands of lives, livelihood and property from alcohol-related injury and illness.    Annually, about 20,000 people die in vehicular &quot;accidents&quot; involving drivers who have been drinking. Most of the victims are young, just entering their productive years of life. While much dispute can occur about the &quot;proper&quot; valuation of life, evidence from recent studies based on behavior in the labor force shows that a value of $5 million to $10 million for a life would not be unreasonable. (These studies analyze the extra compensation people demand to undertake risky work, then extrapolate to the value of a life.) And highway crashes are only a small part of the total damage; by some estimates, alcohol contributes to 100,000 to 200,000 deaths annually in the U.S. through such diverse mechanisms as drowning, homicide, liver cirrhosis, industrial accidents, and fires.    Significantly higher alcohol taxes would greatly reduce this alcohol-related catastrophe. Multiple studies now available, using widely different approaches and data, create convincing evidence that higher taxes reduce highway fatalities, and thus reduce the externality imposed by drinking drivers. Even liver cirrhosis, a disease of chronic alcoholics, declines when alcohol prices rise. Thus, there is clear evidence that higher alcohol taxes reduce problem-drinking, not just &quot;social drinking.&quot; At least for moderate tax increases, each percentage-point increase in tax will reduce auto fatalities by about 1%.    During the Korean War, federal alcohol taxes were raised to their highest real rate in this century. These excises remained unchanged, while inflation badly eroded their real value, until a 19% increase in the federal distilled spirits tax occurred a year ago. Even with that increase, the inflation-adjusted federal tax on distilled spirits is a mere quarter of its 1951 level, and wine and beer taxes are even lower for equivalent amounts of alcohol. Thus, federal tax policy has helped contribute to the economic and human catastrophe that alcohol annually creates or sustains.    A higher tax on alcohol has the happy side-effect of helping reduce the federal deficit. Restoring federal liquor taxes to 1951 real levels for distilled spirits, and equalizing the tax rate (per alcohol equivalent) for wine and beer, would in a single stroke of the pen create an estimated $20 billion of the current Gramm-Rudman-Hollings requirement of $23 billion. This tax revenue accounts for permanent consumption changes and might even be higher in the first years after the tax is increased.    To raise this $20 billion, the tax on a &quot;fifth&quot; of 80-proof liquor would increase by almost $6; for a &quot;fifth&quot; of wine, $2.25; for a six-pack of beer, about $2.20. These tax increases would reduce alcohol consumption by some 30%, and the annual economic catastrophe caused by drinking would decline in parallel. Fortuitously, the $20 billion revenue is only half of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings story; the declines in alcohol-related illness and injury would reduce federal outlays (Medicare, Medicaid, VA, military health care) by comparable amounts, a desirable double dip.    In addition, while higher liquor taxes create large revenues, they do not distort labor market or capital-formation incentives, unlike higher income or capital-gains taxes. Indeed, the reduced alcohol use would create a healthier, more productive work force. Thus, true supply-side economics advocates should favor higher alcohol taxes on all counts.    However, we should not let the revenue goals determine the tax levy. The correct tax, rather than maximizing revenue, would balance off the costs imposed on drinkers with the dollar value of damage they inflict on others. And we should guard against the tax being too high, as a very high tax would lead to bootlegging, moonshining and no real change in behavior.    It can be argued that the government should ignore people's behavior that harms only themselves. If drinkers understand the risks of death or illness, then no role for government intervention necessarily arises. But even this cautious view justifies much higher alcohol taxes than we currently have. For every four drinking drivers who kill themselves, approximately three innocent victims also die. The lives of the innocent are an external cost that creates good cause for government action. In one study I recently conducted, trading off the economic value of additional lives saved with the economic losses to drinkers from the higher tax, I found that tax increases like those discussed above (equalizing taxes and raising to real levels of 1951) are readily justified.    And if drinkers do not understand the risks of their behavior, then they drink &quot;too much&quot; compared with their fully informed choices, and the economic benefits from higher alcohol taxes extend past &quot;innocent victims&quot; to include the lives and health of the drinkers themselves. Based on preliminary studies, young drivers do not appear to understand how much drinking increases their risk of fatal crashes. After six drinks, young people are 10 to 20 times more likely to kill themselves than they think they are. If this phenomenon is pervasive, then the &quot;best&quot; tax on alcohol should take the lives and injuries of drunken drivers into account.    The political response to the Crash of '87 creates a rare opportunity to help reduce the number of alcohol-related crashes that plague every year.    ---   Mr. Phelps is a professor of political science and economics, and director, Public Policy Analysis Program, University of Rochester. </TEXT></DOC>
