(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Despite massive service cutbacks forfall and the layoffs of more than 3,000 employees, Eastern AirlinesPresident Phil Bakes announced a 10 percent increase in flightsthis winter.   Bakes said flights would be added to the carrier's schedule Nov.1 and Dec. 15, but would not elaborate about the increases.   The increases would be in Eastern's ``core'' markets along theEast Coast and in Latin America, company spokeswoman Paula Mustosaid Tuesday. She ruled out a return to cities Eastern recentlyabandoned.   While company officials said it was too early to talk aboutpossibly recalling laid-off workers, union leaders said Eastern hasto bring back some workers if it plans flight increases.   ``The problem is the rest of the work force has been cut down tothe bone,'' said John Knudson, a spokesman for the Air Line PilotsAssociation.   The Miami-based carrier earlier this month closed its KansasCity hub, halted service to 14 cities and eliminated 4,000 jobs.More than 3,000 people have been laid off, with others targeted forleaves of absence or early retirements.   Many of its 3,500 pilots are owed thousands of hours of vacationtime, much of which will be deferred until 1989 so as to boostflights this year, Bakes said.   Bakes announced the increases to a meeting of travel agents herein a move to reassure agents that Eastern can overcome bitternegotiations with its unions over contract concessions andfinancial problems.   The airline has $400 million in cash, Bakes said, enough tocompete effectively in its traditional East Coast and LatinAmerican markets.   ``We intend to spend it as we have been _ on our very basicbusiness,'' Bakes said.   But union officials point out that Eastern has loaned $40million to its sister carrier Continental Airlines and they allegethat asset sales are designed to diminish the union's influence.   The unions have challenged Eastern's layoffs and cutback plans,and a federal appeals court in Washington is expected to rule onthe layoffs this week.</TEXT></DOC>
