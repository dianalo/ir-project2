BirnbaumStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 09/18/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> CONGRESS (CNG) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The plagiarism issue that continues to swirl around Sen. Joseph Biden threatens to destroy his nascent presidential campaign and erode his credibility as chairman of the Senate committee weighing Robert Bork's qualifications for the Supreme Court.    Mr. Biden sought to defuse the issue at a Capitol Hill news conference yesterday, but political professionals said his explanations may not be enough to salvage his political campaign, which was only beginning to take hold in the early caucus and primary states.    Already the focus in political circles has shifted from Mr. Biden's views on various issues and his vision of a rebirth of American idealism to questions of character. These deal with such matters as whether he unfairly lifted phrases from other political figures and whether including five pages of a published law-review article in his own law-school paper 23 years ago was, as he put it, &quot;a mistake&quot; but not &quot;malevolent.&quot;    &quot;The difficulty isn't his failure to attribute the quotes,&quot; says Michael Hawthorne, a political scientist at Grinnell College in Iowa, site of the first presidential caucuses. &quot;The difficulty is that his campaign hasn't begun to move here and he hasn't differentiated himself from the others. Now people are going to wonder what he really stands for.&quot;    At the same time, Mr. Biden may have surrendered some high ground in his effort to defeat the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Bork, President Reagan's choice to succeed retired Justice Lewis Powell. This incident has raised new questions about the ability of the chairman to lead a credible fight against Mr. Bork. &quot;His credibility, his stature is undermined by virtue of this incident,&quot; says Stephen Gillers, a professor of legal ethics at New York University Law School.    &quot;In this business, the little things kill you, not the big things,&quot; says Harrison Hickman, a Democratic political consultant. &quot;And sometimes you're dead before you know it.&quot;    Mr. Biden, who is generally placed in the middle of the field of Democratic presidential contenders, indicated that he intends to continue his campaign for the party's nomination. Though his campaign leadership is composed of experienced political professionals and he raised $3.3 million through June 30 -- more than any Democratic rival except Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis -- his organizational efforts have lagged and his campaigning has been curtailed because of his preparations for the Bork hearings.    Political analysts believe that the timing of the disclosures raises the dangers for Mr. Biden, who was hoping to use the Bork hearings as a forum to display his legal acuity and his ability to handle substantive issues.    &quot;No one can make the argument that this stuff is helpful,&quot; says Joseph Grandmaison, chairman of the Democratic Party in New Hampshire, site of the first presidential primary. &quot;This is a candidate who is only in the process of developing recognition, and so it is much more meaningful.&quot; Paul McEachern, two-time Democratic gubernatorial candidate in New Hampshire, adds: &quot;It's being blown out of proportion, but these kinds of things do have a way of affecting people's fortunes.&quot;    Sen. Biden's political allies are hoping that the plagiarism furor, which occurs as the campaign embarks on an important fund-raising offensive, will soon fade and that the Delaware Democrat will recapture the initiative with a forceful but sober presence as chairman of the televised Judiciary Committee hearings. &quot;The people out there in America,&quot; says former Iowa state Senate leader Lowell Junkins, a Biden supporter, &quot;understand average folks sometimes make mistakes.&quot;    In his news conference, Mr. Biden was strained, saying he wanted to get the ordeal over &quot;as quickly as I can.&quot; But as it wore on, he rambled and punctuated his performance with flashes of anger and embarrassment.    Documents released by the senator indicate mediocre academic performances in both graduate and undergraduate schools. In addition to a course in legal method, which he failed for plagiarism but later passed with a B, he failed courses in contracts (later repeated for a low D) and domestic relations (later repeated for a low C). And though he previously said he had started slowly at law school and ended up in the middle of his class, he actually graduated 76th in a class of 85 students.    Mr. Biden also has told reporters that he received an academic scholarship to cover his full law-school tuition at Syracuse University. The records released yesterday showed that he received a scholarship for only half his tuition and only after he applied for financial aid based on economic need. His undergraduate records and his recommendations from professors for law school, moreover, don't reflect that he merited an academic scholarship. At the University of Delaware, he graduated 506th out of a class of 688 with a 2.29, or C, average. He received only five A's in his four years there, two of them in physical education.    Asked how Mr. Biden scored in terms of intellectual achievement in recommendations to law school, six undergraduate professors ranked him either average or slightly above average. One professor wrote: &quot;He spent his first three years here trying to be the complete 'Joe College' with the result that his academic record does not reflect his true ability.&quot;    The plagiarism issue emerged last weekend when the New York Times and the Des Moines Register reported that Mr. Biden failed to attribute portions of a speech at this summer's Iowa State Fair to Neil Kinnock, the leader of the British Labor Party. Yesterday, a Biden spokesman said the Kinnock remarks were also used without attribution in a speech before the National Educational Association.    Other similarities between Mr. Biden's rhetoric and that of John and Robert Kennedy were discovered in recent days. Although campaign rhetoric is often lifted without attribution, the senator blamed some of these similarities on his aides, saying they failed to include clear attributions in the texts of prepared speeches. He said a passage closely resembling Robert Kennedy's statement that &quot;the gross national product does not allow for the health of our children, the quality of their education or the joy of their play,&quot; delivered at the California State Democratic Convention last winter, was inserted by an aide.    &quot;If the standard for political speechmakers is going to be that they need to attribute every quote they make, we won't have many candidates,&quot; says former Rep. Norman D'Amours of New Hampshire, a Biden supporter. Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia, who hasn't endorsed any Democratic candidate, added: &quot;I don't think he deserves capital punishment for running a red light.&quot;    But Biden aides know that the issue raises the question of whether Mr. Biden's vision is genuine or borrowed, and they acknowledge that the campaign faces serious challenges. &quot;The American people are very fair-minded,&quot; says John Marttila, a Biden campaign consultant, &quot;but they are also tough critics.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
