Earlier, Mrs. Thatcher, shouting above scenes of near-uproar inthe Commons, faced a barrage of opposition taunts over Lawson'sresignation.   Opponents also accused her of robbing Britain of an effectiverole in the European Economic Community by balking at linking thepound to Europe's other major currencies _ the key dispute betweenher and Lawson.   He quit last Thursday saying he could not continue as long asMrs. Thatcher kept her personal part-time economic adviser, SirAlan Walters, who opposed full British membership in the EuropeanMonetary System (EMS) that links nine European currencies. Walterslater resigned, too.   The new Chancellor of the Exchequer, John Major, pledged thateconomic policy would not change. He said he will stick to theLawson strategy of increasing basic bank interest rates _ now at 15percent _ as the main tool of dampening inflation.   Major, sounding more enthusiastic than Mrs. Thatcher about fullEMS membership, added, ``The question is not whether we shouldjoin, but when.''   Mrs. Thatcher reiterated her stringent conditions for joiningthe exchange rate mechanism of the system including free movementof capital. She gave no date for membership.   Opposition Labor Party legislators declared she has no intentionof joining the EMS fully before the next election, which must beheld by mid-1992.   They attacked during a debate called by Labor on Tuesday seekingto censure the Conservative government for its handling of theeconomy. As expected, the opposition censure motion was easilydefeated by a vote of 342 to 238.   ``In this party ministers decide and advisers only advise,''said Mrs. Thatcher, who has a 101-seat majority in the 650-memberHouse of Commons.   On Europe, she added, ``We believe in Europe, a Europe based ona free economy ... not a regulated bureaucracy dictating to thisHouse from Brussels.''   As Lawson rose to speak publicly for the first time sinceresigning, the rowdy scenes subsided in the Commons.   Intervening in the debate on the troubled economy, Lawsondescribed Walters' stance on British membership in the EuropeanMonetary System's exchange rate mechanism as ``the tip of asingularly ill-concealed iceberg with all the destructive potentialthat icebergs possess.''   ``Britain's destiny lies in Europe. ... It is vital that wemaximize Britain's influence in the community.   ``I have little doubt that we will not be able to exercise thatinfluence effectively ... as long as we remain largely outside theEMS. So for economic and political reasons alike, it is importantthat we seek the earliest practicable time to join, rather than thelatest for which a tolerable case can be made.''   Mrs. Thatcher's popularity ratings have slid further behindLabor in the furor. Critics, including some within the party,redoubled charges she is autocratic and fails to consult or listento the rest of the 22-member Cabinet.</TEXT></DOC>
