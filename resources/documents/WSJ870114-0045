More than 60% of the economists surveyed in November by the National Association of Business Economists said they expect a downturn before the end of 1988. Furthermore, history indicates the chances of economic growth lasting for two more years are slim. By November 1988, the current expansion would be six years old; no peacetime expansion since the 18th century has survived that long. The only longer economic expansions were during World War II and the Vietnam War.    Those facts worry GOP political analysts. &quot;We think about that every day,&quot; says White House political director Mitchell Daniels. A healthy economy is the Republicans' &quot;hole card,&quot; he says. &quot;I hope we're still holding it when the time comes.&quot;    &quot;The economy is the most important issue that's going to drive the 1988 election,&quot; says Charles Black, top strategist for the presidential campaign of Rep. Jack Kemp (R., N.Y.). &quot;Whoever is the Republican nominee will suffer&quot; if a recession hits.    Reagan administration economic adviser Beryl Sprinkel has tried to assure White House political strategists that current economic indicators provide no hint that the expansion will come to an end. But even Mr. Sprinkel admits those indicators offer little guidance beyond 1987. &quot;The vision gets cloudy&quot; after next year, says another White House official.    Aware of the danger, Chief of Staff Donald Regan has told the White House staff that the &quot;single most important goal&quot; of the second Reagan term is to promote continued growth in the economy, officials say.    Reagan administration officials are counting on the Federal Reserve Board to be the front line in the effort to prevent a recession before the 1988 elections. But the current chairman, Paul Volcker, demonstrated in both the 1980 and 1984 election years that he wouldn't alter his tough anti-inflation policies to fit the president's election needs. Mr. Volcker's term as chairman expires in August of this year, and White House officials have made it clear they'd like to replace the independent-minded central banker with someone who is more of a &quot;team player.&quot;    Moreover, President Reagan in the past three years has appointed four new Fed governors who have strengthened the ties between the Fed and the Reagan administration, and who have tilted Fed policy more toward promoting growth. The president also is likely to name Edward Kelley, a Texas investment counselor and a close friend of Treasury Secretary James Baker, to fill a fifth vacancy on the seven-member board.    White House officials say they are currently pleased with the policies being pursued by the Fed. But if signs of renewed inflation prompt the central bank to tighten its credit grip later this year or next year, a worried White House may want to apply pressure against such a tightening.    &quot;With Reagan loyalists over there, the Fed might be more responsive&quot; to GOP election needs, says Mr. Black.    Reagan administration officials also say that budget-cutting efforts also are likely to ease if a recession appears imminent. The president is now insisting that Congress meet the tough $108 billion deficit target called for under the Gramm-Rudman budget law. But &quot;there is general agreement that if the economy goes down, Gramm-Rudman could be suspended temporarily,&quot; says Commerce Undersecretary Robert Ortner.    Even tax overhaul, the top legislative achievement of the president's second term, is likely to come under attack if a recession arises before the 1988 election. A downturn would cause a clamor for restoring some of the investment incentives that the tax bill eliminated. Russell Long, who retired from the Senate at the beginning of this year, notes that the investment credit has been repealed twice in the past, and then restored as soon as the economy turned sour. Mr. Long, the former chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, predicts it will happen again.    &quot;A lot of people will be coming up with a variety of ideas&quot; for altering the tax bill if the economy goes bad, says Sen. John Danforth (R., Mo.).    To be sure, forecasting downturns is a tricky business, and nobody can say with any certainty when the next one will occur. &quot;My economist friends have predicted eight of the last three recessions,&quot; says Democratic pollster Harrison Hickman.    Moreover, the signs that usually precede a downturn are virtually nonexistent now. Inflation remains well under control, inventories are trim and factories are still operating far below their capacity. &quot;While it is certainly true that this recovery is four years old, it doesn't have the geriatric characteristics of a four-year-old expansion,&quot; says economist Alan Greenspan.    But there are other problems that threaten the economy's health. Consumer and corporate debt has piled up to unprecedented levels, raising the possibility of some sort of financial crisis. The nation's trade deficit continues to grow, defying the predictions of those in the Reagan administration and elsewhere who expected it to be narrowing by now. And capital investment is flat on its back, reflecting in part the short-term effect of the tax bill. As a result, says Edward Yardeni, chief economist of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., &quot;I think it's extremely likely&quot; that a recession will begin within the next two years.    If a downturn does hit before the 1988 elections, the damage to the Republican Party could be considerable. The recession late in the Eisenhower administration was critical in the election of John F. Kennedy in 1960. A weak economy helped Jimmy Carter oust President Gerald Ford in 1976 (though the after-effect of Watergate was probably a bigger factor), and helped Ronald Reagan trounce President Carter in 1980.    If a recession occurs, President Reagan may point a finger at the Democratic-led Congress. But political scientists argue that ploy won't work. &quot;People tend to blame the president more than Congress for economic problems,&quot; says Richard A. Watson, a political scientist at the University of Missouri.    ---   Recession Expectations   A survey by the National Association     of Business Economists in November   showed a breakdown of when its     members expect a recession to begin   1986.....................1%     1987 .................... 31%   1988....................30%     1989 or later ........... 38%</TEXT></DOC>
