(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Directors of Reebok International Ltd.,faced with the prospect of nearly one-third of the company's stockon the market, have adopted a series of anti-takeover defenses tokeep corporate raiders away from the sneaker company.   Pentland Industries PLC of England announced it would sell the31.5 percent of Reebok stock it owns.   In response, the directors of the Stoughton-based manufacturerof sneakers and casual wear adopted a shareholder rights planThursday.   It entitles stock-owners to buy additional shares at a greatlyreduced price in the event of a takeover attempt. The issuance ofnew stock would make it expensive for a buyer to take control ofthe company.   Reebok also announced its board will take advantage of a newMassachusetts law and create three classes of directors, whichlengthens the time it would take to install an entirely new board.   Pentland Industries, a shoe manufacturer and investment companyin Finchley, England, helped Reebok to success in the early 1980s.   It loaned money to Paul Fireman, chairman of Reebok, andprovided him with letters of credit after Fireman bought the rightsto distribute Reebok shoes from a small British company.   ``They've made a lot of money with it,'' said Paul F. Duncan,Reebok's chief financial officer. ``It's been an extraordinaryinvestment for them. ... Pentland has expressed a desire to selltheir shares and get on with whatever else they want to do inlife.''   The reason for Pentland's desire to sell its Reebok stock wasnot disclosed.   Fireman and Rubin had a cross-agreement under which either hadfirst right to buy the other's shares if placed on the market.   It was not known whether Fireman would buy Pentland's stock inReebok. Fireman and his wife own 14.5 percent of Reebok shares.</TEXT></DOC>
