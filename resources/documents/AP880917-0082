About 20protesters were arrested.   Students later held a rally at Korea University in the north ofSeoul and burned an effigy painted with an American flag in theshape of a nuclear bomb.   ``Oppose dictator's Olympics,'' students chanted at bothprotests.   About 200 students shouting anti-Olympic slogans tried to marchthrough Seoul's main shopping district towards Myongdong Cathedralto protest the opening of the Games. The brief protest was heldabout 10 miles from the Olympic venues.   Scores of riot police charged the march after it had gone about150 yards. Police roughly dispersed the protesters.   Riot police punched and kicked protesters and arrested about 20who were forced into a bus and taken away. Others protesters fledas police chased them.   It was the first protest staged in the city center in severalweeks. Protesters did not attempt to fight police.   Nearly 10,000 Olympic athletes from 160 countries opened thebiggest athletic show on earth Saturday under a massive securityblanket and the jealous glare of communist North Korea.   A colorful, 3{-hour spectacle, mixing ancient Korean ritualswith space-age technology, kicked off 16 days of athleticcompetition at the Summer Games. The Games will produce the firstall-out East-West gold rush since the 1976 Games in Montreal.   Later Saturday, about 300 students staged an anti-Americanprotest at Korea University. They denounced the South Korea andU.S. governments and demanded the Olympics be shared with communistNorth Korea.   ``Yankee go home,'' students shouted as they shot their fistsinto the air.   About 400 riot police kept watch outside the school, but did notintervene and students dispersed without a confrontation.   Radical students have staged many protests against the Olympicsand the government of President Roh Tae-woo.   The radicals are demanding the Olympics be shared with NorthKorea to help unify the two Koreas which were divided at the end ofWorld War II in 1945 and which fought the 1950-1953 Korean War   North Korea boycotted the Olympics after its demand to co-hostthe Games was turned down by the International Olympic Committee.   The radicals contend the United States helps to enforce thepartition of the Korean peninsula. Radicals demand the expulsion ofthe 42,000 U.S. troops based in the nation under a mutual defensetreaty.</TEXT></DOC>
