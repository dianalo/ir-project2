Experimentswere carried out with solutions of sodium and/or calcium ions, whichare the ions commonly found in the formation. Freshwater flooding ofsandstones previously exposed to sodium salt solutions results in therelease of clay particles and a drastic reduction in permeability. Thepermeability reduction is lessened, however, when calcium ions are alsopresent in the salt solution. Formation damage is virtually eliminatedwhen the solution composition is adjusted to give calcium surface coveragesgreater than a critical value of 75%. The effect of the fluid compositionon the damage process is explained by the double-layer interactions betweenthe surface of the clay particles and the pore walls.</TEXT></DOC>
