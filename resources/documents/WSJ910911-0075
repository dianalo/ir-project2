The plant, located near this eastern Washington city, hadbeen closed for routine maintenance in April. A restartplanned for mid-June was delayed when operating crews faileda requalification test required by the Nuclear RegulatoryCommission.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We fell behind the curve and we weren't prepared in ourtraining of operators to handle severe emergencies, and nowwe're being forced to play catch-up,&quot; said John Britton, aWPPSS spokesman.   At full power, the plant supplies 1,100 megawatts ofelectricity to the Bonneville Power Administration, a federalagency that distributes power throughout the PacificNorthwest. Walter Pollock, acting administrator of theagency, said that the plant's downtime could cost the agencyabout $4 million a week in lost revenue.   But Mr. Pollock said that the region's electrical supplywon't be affected, because the agency can draw on alternativesources, such as the Columbia River hydroelectric powersystem.</TEXT></DOC>
