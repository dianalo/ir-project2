Nor is he Daniel Joseph Merritt, or Harold Robert Princeor any of the other 99 aliases he allegedly used whileromancing his way into the hearts and pocketbooks of hundredsof women across the U.S.</LP><TEXT>   In fact, law-enforcement officials concede they have noclue to the man's true identity. That's why the bank-fraudindictment returned last week in Dallas is styled U.S. vs.John Doe, a more serious-sounding moniker than the man'spopular nickname, the &quot;Sweetheart Swindler.&quot;   Prosecutors say trials of John Does aren't unheard of butare still far from common. This particular Mr. Doe stands outamong his namesakes because no one has come forward with apositive identification despite network-television exposurein the U.S. and numerous newspaper articles in the U.S. andCanada.   &quot;We may never know who he really is,&quot; says a spokesman forthe Federal Bureau of Investigation in Dallas.   At least 13 women in nine states say they knew this Mr.Doe as a sweet-talker who alternately claimed to be in thejewelry business or just plain wealthy, according to theindictment. In addition to promising steady dates and,sometimes, marriage, Mr. Doe offered financial assistance toeach woman, the indictment says.   Mr. Doe is accused of inducing the women to deposit checksinto their bank accounts and then give him half of the faceamount of the checks in cash. The checks, according to theindictment, had been stolen from Mr. Doe's previousgirlfriends and forged. By the time the checks bounced backas unpayable, the indictment says, Mr. Doe was courtingelsewhere.   Mr. Doe's next date won't involve the kind of courtinghe's allegedly accustomed to: He's expected to be in Dallasfederal court as early as this week for bond setting and atrial date.   Right now, he's in jail in Kenosha, Wis., where he wasarrested in March after a jilted lover blew the whistle onhim. Mr. Doe was originally charged there as Robert J. Koch,but after his fingerprints matched those of a man with anentirely different name, prosecutors gave up and charged himas Mr. Doe. His attorney couldn't be reached for comment.   As for pinning down Mr. Doe's identity, &quot;we don't everhave to really know who he is,&quot; the FBI spokesman says. &quot;Wejust have to prove that the person we have is the person whodid this stuff.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
