In the past, Japanese investors have gobbled up as much as 30% of Treasury auctions. This time, however, many Japanese investors say they aren't convinced the U.S. bond rally will endure. Others fear that if interest rates do continue to decline, the dollar will go down too. If the dollar falls, Japanese foreign-exchange losses could swamp any gains on rising bond prices.    At best, Japanese investors see this week's Treasury offering of $27 billion in notes and bonds as a chance for quick profits. Few are inclined to boost dollar bond holdings substantially.    &quot;They will go to the auction, buy bonds and after a few weeks of appreciation sell out,&quot; says Ron Napier, a vice president at Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd. &quot;I don't see a lot of people in it for the long term.&quot;    It will be difficult to tell from the auction itself exactly which way the Japanese are going. &quot;They have developed ways to participate, but not really participate,&quot; says Richard Koo, senior economist at Nomura Research Institute. Japanese investors have been known to feign no interest and then jump in at the last minute. When other investors realize the Japanese are piling in and prices shoot up, the Japanese duck out with quick profits.    That allows Japanese investors to save face with their Ministry of Finance, which is believed to favor continued U.S. investments. But they don't actually add much to their holdings.    Japanese investors have suffered huge currency losses the past couple of years as U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker and other U.S. officials have talked the dollar down. For Japan's seven largest life insurance companies combined, portfolio losses have amounted to more than $13 billion a year -- although most of these losses are unrealized because the securities aren't actually sold. While the dollar currently is stable, investors wonder how long that will last, especially if U.S. trade figures worsen.    Most big Japanese life insurance companies and trust banks say they have no plans to add U.S. dollar bonds to their portfolios anytime soon. &quot;A decrease in U.S. interest rates is good for our existing portfolios, but it doesn't encourage us to put new money into U.S. Treasuries,&quot; says Kohzo Nishimoto, vice president and general manager, foreign investment department, at Meiji Mutual Life Insurance Co.    Japanese investors have been losing enthusiasm for the U.S. bond market since last March, when the dollar fell below 150 yen and bond prices plummeted. Net purchases of foreign bonds plummeted to $1.78 billion in December, the lowest since April 1984, according to Nomura Securities Co. For the year, net purchases of foreign bonds fell 22% to $72.9 billion.    A big question for Japanese investors is what the dollar does after the auction. According to Japanese regulations, life insurance companies could be forced to report currency losses if the dollar falls more than 15% from the end of March 1987 to March 31. For many investors, the magic number that would require them to report such losses is 126 yen to the dollar.    Takashi Nakayama, a director at Daiwa Investment Trust andamp; Management Co. isn't too optimistic. &quot;Looking back on last year, in pre-auction periods the dollar was firm but it weakened afterward. I wonder if that's not the pattern we are going to see again,&quot; he says.    Naoyoshi Kiyono, deputy general manager of the international investment department at Yasuda Mutual Life Insurance Co., says he has drastically altered his portfolio over the past 18 months. Of Yasuda's total assets of 3.6 trillion yen, Mr. Kiyono invests about 648 billion yen in foreign bonds and 72 billion yen in foreign equities. He reduced the dollar bond content of his portfolio to one-third from two-thirds, and picked up British, German, French and Dutch bonds instead.    &quot;We're on the low side when it comes to dollar assets, but we think that's the right level now,&quot; he says. </TEXT></DOC>
