Gorbachev in Moscow on May 29, butthe majority leader says Democrats won't be rushed.   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., appealed on Monday forswift action on the treaty. He said the president deserves to beaccommodated on his wish not to go to Moscow empty-handed.   President Reagan has said it is important for the Senate toratify the treaty before he meets Gorbachev because there is littlechance the two sides will make further arms control progress unlessthe Senate has acted favorably.   But Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia said herefused ``to be rushed or harried'' on the matter before remainingproblems are cleared away.   Byrd said he will not call up the treaty for debate before May9. He added he may not do so then unless it can be shown theSoviets agree with the U.S. position that the pact bansmedium-range ``futuristic'' weapons such as those using laser raysor particle beam generators.   Dole and other Republicans huddled Monday with White House chiefof staff Howard Baker and national security adviser Colin Powell todevise a strategy to deal with Byrd's concerns and get the treatydebate started.   Byrd replied: ``I want to accommodate the president too, andwill accommodate the president where I can. ... But that is not myfirst responsibility. ... That is not my first objective.   ``I'm going to accommodate the Senate and our responsibilitiesunder the Constitution first, before the accommodation of anybodyelse or any other office.''   The treaty is silent on future weapons, but U.S. negotiatorscontend the pact bans all weapons with ranges of from 300 miles to3,400 miles, no matter how they are armed.</TEXT></DOC>
