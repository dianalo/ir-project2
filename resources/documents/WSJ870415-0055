Tass said Mr. Gorbachev &quot;expressed the readiness to record in an agreement on medium-range missiles the Soviet Union's obligation to eliminate its shorter-range missiles within a relatively short and clearly defined time frame.&quot;    The proposal also includes significant compromises on President Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative, or SDI, and on nuclear testing. Mr. Gorbachev, according to Tass, for the first time accepted SDI research outside the laboratory on earthbound test ranges. He also agreed to the U.S. formula of reducing nuclear testing by first ratifying two agreements from the 1970s, abandoning for now Soviet demands for a complete ban.    The Tass report said Mr. Gorbachev referred to his newest proposal as his &quot;last efforts&quot; to reach an arms-control agreement. The proposal, offered during a 4 1/2-hour meeting in the Kremlin between Mr. Gorbachev and U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz, clearly threw U.S. negotiators off balance.    While there has been widespread speculation about an eventual Soviet offer to eliminate the short-range missiles, U.S. officials were surprised that the proposal came so early in the negotiating process.    The proposal is likely to alarm many Western European officials. Both U.S. and European officials are concerned that the removal of nuclear weapons from the continent would leave Europe exposed to superior Soviet conventional armed forces.    In Santa Barbara, Calif., where President Reagan is vacationing, White House officials said Mr. Gorbachev's proposal as described by Tass was &quot;interesting.&quot; But they wouldn't say what the U.S. response to such an offer would be.    At a briefing in Moscow shortly after the Tass dispatch was issued, State Department spokesman Charles Redman refused to discuss the details of the meetings. However, his comments cast a relatively downbeat tone. He called Mr. Shultz's meetings with Mr. Gorbachev &quot;intensive and businesslike,&quot; avoiding more positive terms. A State Department official said that the two negotiating teams weren't working on a communique; such a document would have suggested a degree of agreement.    Officials said they would avoid a direct response until after consultations with allies that will begin later today. They were clearly angered by the report, which broke a mutually agreed embargo on news of the talks.    One official said the Soviets left it unclear whether the agreement to abolish short-range missiles would be part of an agreement on medium-range weapons or would be stated only as a goal that would need to be negotiated in a later agreement.    Soviet superiority in short-range nuclear weapons has been the key impediment to the Reagan administration's efforts to reach an agreement on medium-range missiles.    The Soviets have more than 130 short-range missile systems. The U.S. has none, although the West Germans have 72 short-range missiles for which the U.S. holds the warheads. Washington has refused to count those missiles as part of its arsenal.    The U.S. had hoped to gain the right to build up to Soviet short-range missile levels, rather than eliminating those weapons, in order to preserve a deterrent to the Soviet superiority in conventional arms.    Mr. Gorbachev's proposal on the SDI program defined what research Moscow would accept, including research in institutes, in factories and on test ranges on Earth. On nuclear testing, Tass reported: &quot;To get the matters off the ground, the Soviet Union is prepared for working out jointly a formula that would make it possible to ratify the 1974 and 1976 agreements, to come to terms on a considerable lessening of the yield and number of explosions.&quot;    Tass said the &quot;key provisions&quot; Mr. Gorbachev proposed to work out about arms control could become the subject of an arrangement at the summit level.    However, Mr. Gorbachev earlier in the day was cool toward traveling to the U.S. unless an arms agreement is assured. Mr. Shultz delivered to Mr. Gorbachev a letter from President Reagan, restating the president's invitation to a summit in the U.S. </TEXT></DOC>
