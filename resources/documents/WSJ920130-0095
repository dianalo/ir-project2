Butthe aerospace giant's stock fell sharply on rumors thatUnited Airlines may back away from some jetliner orders.   Profit rose to $403 million, or $1.17 a share, from $318million, or 92 cents a share, a year earlier on an 11% risein revenue to $7.75 billion from $7.02 billion. While itdidn't break out the amount of its quarterly defense-relatedoperating profit -- estimated by some on Wall Street to havebeen as high as $50 million -- Boeing said its full-year lossin that arena narrowed to $102 million from $418 million, andit expects profitable defense results this year for the firsttime since 1988.</LP><TEXT>   Still, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading,Boeing shares fell $3 to $50.625 on volume of 2.5 millionshares, a tumble that aerospace securities analystsattributed to investors' fears of a fleet retrenchment planthat might accompany a dismal earnings report today fromUnited's parent, UAL Corp.   UAL has already said a loss in the fourth quarter would beits largest quarterly deficit ever. But analysts tended todismiss rumors that UAL would make significant changes in thefirm orders that United has placed with Boeing.   &quot;I don't think it will happen,&quot; said Paul Nisbet, whofollows both the aerospace and airline industries forPrudential Securities Inc. He and other analysts insteadexpect a more-general statement that United, following abroad move among U.S. airlines to slash budgets and delaylong-term expansion plans, will reduce the number of planesfor which it has options. Last fall, American Airlines andUSAir made such announcements about delaying growth andtaking fewer options but didn't pare their firm orders foraircraft.   If United's firm orders remain intact, &quot;I'd be verysurprised if the {Boeing} stock doesn't go up,&quot; Mr. Nisbetsaid, noting how handily the fourth-quarter earnings outpacedhis own $1.05-a-share estimate. The analyst acknowledged thatBoeing, which owes about 17% of its entire backlog to United,is especially sensitive to rumors about the big airline'sfleet plans. Firm United orders include 104 smaller 737aircraft, which Seattle-based Boeing yesterday suggestedcould be a candidate for production-rate cuts again thisyear.   In Chicago, a UAL spokesman wouldn't comment on the rumorsthat it might pull back from some Boeing orders.   Still, there is likely to be some impact on Boeing fromany retrenchment at United, an airline with a $15.8 billioncapital expenditure plan through 1995. United is consideredcommitted to only $6.9 billion of that amount, with the restconsidered discretionary, and some airline analysts speculatethat United could cut $2 billion to $4 billion from the plan.   For its part, Boeing cautioned that 1992 airline prospectsworld-wide are uncertain, after last year's flat air trafficand severe airline losses in the U.S. and elsewhere. But itadded that &quot;traffic and yields appeared to be improving atyear-end.&quot; Even with Boeing's 1991 jetliner order bookregistering a total of $20.6 billion in new bookings-257planes in all, down from 543 worth $48 billion in its 1990banner yeartotal backlog grew slightly to $97.2 billion as ofDec. 31.   Boeing held out especially high hopes for the long-range777, 86 of which have been ordered since the program waslaunched last year. The twin-engine plane sells for $100million and competes with the McDonnell Douglas Corp. MD-11and Airbus Industrie A-330.   &quot;I think there are going to be a lot of 777s ordered thisyear,&quot; said Shearson Lehman Brothers aerospace analyst GaryJ. Reich, noting that Boeing revealed yesterday that itexpects shortly to win an eighth customer for the300-to-400-passenger jetliner.   Mr. Reich was especially impressed with Boeing'sperformance in defense businesses, though. &quot;I was looking ata $200 million loss&quot; that was nearly twice the actual 1991defense-related loss, he said.   Boeing Chairman Frank Shrontz said the year's progress inmilitary and space fields resulted from improved technical,cost and schedule performance, operational consolidation andrestructuring, and the termination of some fixed-pricedevelopment contracts, which he didn't name.   Boeing said that in a time of arms reduction, it benefitsfrom its diversity and the number of programs eligible forupgrade or modification. Still, sales to the U.S. governmentwill level off at around $5 billion the next few years, downfrom last year's $5.6 billion, the company predicted. Thatsuggests that out of the flat total revenue of $29.5 billionthat Boeing said it expects this year, commercial salesshould account for more than the 78% of revenue recorded lastyear.   For all of 1991, net income rose 13% to $1.57 billion, or$4.56 a share, from $1.39 billion, or $4.01 a share, on a6.2% increase in sales to $29.31 billion.   ---   Asra Q.
