The agreement between the Merc and Chicago-based OptionsClearing Corp., announced Monday calls for cross-margining oncertain stock index futures and options accounts.   Margins are deposits paid by traders to cover the risk of dailylosses. Cross margining allows traders to have credit for tradingpositions that reduce their risk of loss.   Under the plan, traders who have protected their positions byhedging in both markets would have to put up less money for theirmargins.   The practice was recommended by a presidential commission thatinvestigated last October's stock market crash and must be approvedby the Securities and Exchange Commission and the CommoditiesFutures Trading Commission.   Officials from the Mercantile Exchange and Options Clearing, thenation's largest options clearing house, have been working on thecross-margining program for about a year.   Had cross-margining been permitted during the huge decline inthe stock market on Oct. 19, it would have reduced the strain onthe nation's financial system and eased demands for cash on severalmajor banks that ran into billions of dollars a day.</TEXT></DOC>
