MAY SOUND like a secret ingredient for toothpaste,but in fact Structured Query Language (SQL for short, pronounced &quot;sequel&quot;) isthe current buzzword in PC database management systems.andM;The people who build powerful database management systems (DBMSs) are rushingto create software that will tie many PCs together on local area networks andconnect those PCs to larger computer systems.andP;  SQL is the language thatlinked computers use to speak to one another.andP;  In one sense, it is secretingredient: individual PC users may never see SQL code.andP;  What they should seeare improvements in the ways they can get at data.andM;Face to FaceandM;Within the PC industry, SQL has become the way to provide a standardinterface--not a user interface, man to machine, but a machine-to-machineinterface--that will let several PCs pool their computing power to handledatabase jobs that until now required bigger hardware.andM;DBMSs have been in the realm of the minicomputer and the mainframe becausedata management has become a large task for even a moderately sized company.andO;Customer and sales information, inventory, accounting data, payroll andpersonnel data, research information, and product documentation have allbecome big database operations in corporations.andM;But being big has its disadvantages.andP;  Big databases on big computers seemalmost musclebound compared to PC systems.andP;  They're expensive, and they tendto become isolated islands of data and processing power.andP;  It can becomedifficult to combine sales data and customer payment histories, for example,when those two databases are maintained by separate computers.andM;And they can be slow.andP;  Getting a report out of a mainframe database typicallyrequires full-time programmers to write the code needed for framing queriesand manipulating data.andM;Switching to PCs brings improvements in all of these areas.andP;  Using 386machines lowers the cost of computing power, and local area networks providebetter access to data.andP;  Also, developments in DBMS technology, expeciallyrelational database software--including SQL, the language spoken byrelational systems--are making it much easier to address a complex query tomore than one data file and get back a report in minutes instead of months.andM;The Magic LinkandM;The name &quot;relational&quot; refers to a DBMS's ability to link data elements indifferent files as long as they share common information.andP;  For instance, alist of customers in cities where a company has warehouses can be created byrelating a customer file to a facilities file, based on the common element ofcity names.andM;In older database structures like the hierarchical systems that ran onmainframes, whenever a query addressed more than one file, every record inall the files had to contain an identical field (a social security number,for instance, or a customer number).andP;  All the files had to be indexed, orsorted, on this key field in the same order.andP;  After that, the DBMS chuggedthrough each record to process the query.andM;Relational systems handle multiple data files much more deftly, because theyaren't constrained by the hierarchical, parent-and-child structure imposed byindexes.andP;  Relational systems are also much smarter: they can understand queryinstructions that ask them to operate on a data set--an entire file--ratherthan comparing one record at a time to the query conditions, as older systemsdid.andM;And how are these set-oriented query instructions expressed?andP;  In SQL, ofcourse.andM;IBM's San Jose laboratories developed SQL in the mid-1970s to reach datastored by System R, IBM's prototype relational database.andP;  This relationalmodel grew into commercial DBMS products--SQL/DS for IBM's midrange computersand DB2 for its mainframes.andP;  Then products such as Oracle, Ingres, and Sybaseput compatible database engines and user tools on computers of allsizes--mainframes, minis, and workstations--and let PCs serve as clients.andO;Most recently, the relational database moved entirely to the PC in standaloneapplications such as Paradox and in network products such as GruptaTechnologies' SQLBase and SQL Server from Microsoft and Ashton-Tate.andM;Programming ProblemsandM;Interest in SQL has grown as products proliferate.andP;  But it's not the kind ofinterest usually shown for computer languages; thousands of programmershaven't learned SQL, and Borland hasn't rushed Turbo SQL to market.andP;  Thereisn't likely to be much of a market, either.andP;  It is possible, but notpleasant, to sit at a PC and key in an SQL query.andP;  &quot;SQL is very subtle,&quot; saysRod Zimmerman of Gupta Technologies, maker of SQLBase.andP;  &quot;It's very difficultto get it right.andP;  It takes an experienced programmer, and even theneverything has to be tested.&quot;andM;Queries expressed in SQL, such as &quot;Select Enumb, Efnam, Elnam, Ecity, Estatefrom EMPL Where (Ecity, Estate) in Select (Scity, Sstate) from SLSOFC,&quot; don'thave much of an intuitive, natural-language feel about them, but they arepowerful.andP;  This one, for instance, would draw data from EMPL, a list ofemployees, and SLSOFC, a file on sales offices, to produce a report thatlists names and addresses of employees who live in the cities where thecompany has sales offices.andM;There are three great things about this query:andM;* The computer user who creates it doesn't have to tell the computer where tofind EMPL and SLSOFC.andP;  The relational DBMS knows where to find them.andM;* On a PC network where the DBMS and data files are located on a server, theentire EMPL and SLSOFC files don't have to be sent to the user's PC toprocess the query.andP;  Instead, the query is sent to the server and processedthere, and only the few data records that answer the query are sent back.andP;  Inthis way, relational systems and SQL greatly reduce the amount of traffic onnetworks.andM;* The user probably wouldn't have to create the SQL statement that expressedthe query.andP;  In most programs, a version of a very familiar application like aspreadsheet, or a simple graphical interface, can be used to create a sampleanswer to the question.andP;  The application then generates the SQL query.andM;Entangling AlliancesandM;A number of SQL database makers that are bringing distributed DBMSs to the PCworld provide all three of these capabilities.andP;  They include the biggestapplications and networking software companies, plus some very small databasesoftware companies with expertise in the more exotic areas of database theoryand practice.andP;  A tangle of alliances has developed between these two groups.andM;Microsoft turned to DBMS maker Sybase for the basic technology used in SQLServer, a product introduced last April and marketed as a joint venture ofMicrosoft and Ashton-Tate.andP;  Microsoft's rival, the Lotus DevelopmentCorporation, struck a similar arrangement with Gupta Technologies to produceLotus/DBMS last spring.andP;  Novell, which makes the dominant LAN operatingsystem, has announced an SQL capability that will sit on top of the Btrievedatabase management system it includes with its NetWare installations.andM;All of these distributed DBMS products are made to run on LANs in theso-called client/server configuration.andP;  The clients are PC users on thenetwork, and their PCs run an application (often called a front end) thatlets them frame queries.andP;  The database server is a computer on the networkdedicated to processing queries and managing the data.andP;  The program that runson the server doesn't provide a user interface; it's simply a software engine(often called a back end) that takes in queries expressed in SQL and does theprocessing--including communicating with other database servers if the queryconditions require it--and delivers the finished report to the user.andM;Smiles and MusclesandM;All this muscle at the back end means that the front end can concentrate onbeing a friendlier interface between the user and the data.andP;  It may even befamiliar: Microsoft and Ashton-Tate have been aggressively recruiting makersof popular DBMS and application software to write versions compatible withSQL Server.andM;Farthest along in this process is Gupta Technologies.andP;  Gupta's databaseengine, called SQLBase, can manage its own data files; it can also addressqueries to IBM's relational DBMS products.andP;  Gupta has lined up a broad rangeof programming options for developing customized database applications forSQLBase--support for C and COBOL programmers, special versions of Word Tech'sdBXL dBASE clone and Quicksilver dBASE compiler, and Gupta's own SQLWindows,which lets programmers develop database applications that run under Windows.andM;The next logical step is to minimize the need to program by using front-endapplications that speak SQL to the database engine.andP;  And that's what ishappening: SQLBase is being supported by Paperback Software's VP-PlannerPlus, VP-Expert, and other packages, and by Revelation Technologies' AdvancedRevelation database, among others.andM;The goal for both application makers and DBMS vendors was made clear byPhilippe Kahn, chairman of Borland International.andP;  Paradox, a Borlanddatabase highly regarded for its easy-to-use query by example (QBE)interface, will have SQL capabilities built in so that it can address anumber of database engines, including SQL Server, the Database Manager inIBM's OS/2 Extended Edition, and Oracle's Oracle Server.andP;  In announcing thisnew direction for Paradox, Kahn said, &quot;We feel that PC users should get thebenefits of common SQL architecture without ever having to directly interactwith the SQL programming language.&quot;andM;In other words, PC users will be able to extend their reach for data withoutmaking major changes in the way they work.andP;  They won't have to learn SQLcommands and structure, nor will they have to abandon applications they knowwell to learn new ones that provide increased power.andM;To that extent, SQL does have something in common with toothpaste: it meansbrighter smiles all around.andM;The Payoff: Products Delivered,andM;and PromisedandM;The great benefit of SQL for PC users will be true distributed databasemanagement.andP;  In other words, users will have access to data stored onmachines other than their own PCs or even on other networks, regardless ofthe brand of the computers or the various database systems they run.andM;Such easy connectivity belongs to the future, but there are ways to reap thebenefits of SQL right now.andP;  They may seem unsophisticated and may work withinonly one product line, but they work.andM;Some products take the direct approach:  They let a user who knows SQL typein a query.andP;  For example, dBASE IV Version 1.0, released last fall, includesa &quot;set SQL on&quot; command that can be followed by a query in SQL.andM;Data Access will follow a similar strategy to bring SQL to DataFlex, its DBMSand application development system.andP;  Later this year, the company willintroduce SQL/Report Writer, a report generator that will accept querieswritten in SQL.andM;The Multilingual ApproachandM;One step up are products that provide an interactive SQL editor andprogramming interfaces to process SQL commands embedded in applicationswritten in other languages.andP;  For instance, Novell's XQL database manager,which provides relational data management for Btrieve files, supportsapplications written in C or COBOL that have SQL statements embedded in thecode.andP;  XQL also includes an interactive SQL editor for testing queries.andM;The number of SQL-based database systems for PCs is growing rapidly.andP;  Theleaders include XDB-SQL from XDB Systems, Oracle's Professional Oracle,Ingres from Relational Technologies, Informix's SQL/4GL, and GuptaTechnologies' SQLBase.andM;IBM's Database Manager, included with OS/2 Extended Edition, belongs in thiscategory of standalone PC database management systems.andP;  Database Manager isdivided into a front end, the Query Manager, and a back end, called DatabaseServices.andP;  Yet despite this two-part structure, it's not a database serverfor a network.andP;  The database server functions are definitely coming, IBM hassaid--but hasn't said when.andM;Connected CommunicationsandM;If they don't come soon, Database Manager may be left in the dust.andP;  AlthoughGupta led the charge into the server/client design for DBMSs on PCs and localarea networks with SQLBase, there's a thundering herd right behind it.andO;Microsoft's SQL Server has made a great deal of noise, and it has been orwill soon be followed into the marketplace by database servers from Oracle,Informix, and XDB Systems, and by NetWare SQL, a database server from Novell.andM;The next cavalry charge is already underway with Borland's announcement thatParadox will provide SQL support for a variety of database engines.andP;  Manyapplication developers have promised to deliver versions of familiar productsthat speak SQL.andP;  This pose a challenge for database server makers.andP;  SQLcompatibility and the rigors of relational database design dictate that mostdatabase engines are going to be pretty much alike.andP;  The winner won't be theone with the niftiest features, but the one with the widest range ofsupporting applications.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
