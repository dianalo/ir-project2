(Product introduction).andO;Product:   Intellifont Scalable Typeface Library (Computer font) (Marketing)TypeStyler 1.5 (Computer graphics software) (Product introduction)SuperPrint (Printer software) (Product introduction).andO;Topic:     Product IntroductionFontsBundled Software.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>FontsandM;Agfa's Intellifonts for Windows 3andM;Agfa Compugraphic announced that its Intellifont font-scaling program soonwill support HP LaserJet III and IIID printers operating in the MicrosoftWindows 3.0 environment.andP;  This development will enable creating screen fontson the fly for any application that currently runs under Windows 3.0, withoutrequiring any software modifications.andM;Intellifont technology has been built into the LaserJet for a couple ofyears.andP;  With it also running within Windows, the user gets the benefits of acommon imaging model for the screen and the printer.andP;  Support for Windows 3.0will be available by the end of this year.andM;Agfa said that it takes about five minutes to install the Intellifontcapability in the PC.andP;  Once installed, it will generate sizes from 4 to 127points automatically and download outlines to the printer, transparent to theuser.andP;  Eight fonts are supplied as standard, with the entire Intellifontlibrary available.andP;  The program supports the 585-character HP symbol set.andM;Intellifont support.andP;  Agfa reported that it recently had licensed Intellifonttechnology to more than 17 companies for integration into their hardware andsoftware products.andP;  Companies that will use the Agfa technology to developLaserJet emulation software to supply to printer OEMs include Adaptec,Argilla, Destiny Technology, Lincoln andamp; Co., Personal Computer Products(PCPI), the Peerless Group, Phoenix Technologies and Rastek.andM;Software publishers that will use Intellifont technology to generate screenfonts from outlines are Delrina Technology, Laser Tools, Power Up Softwareand Ventura Publisher User Group.andM;A few companies have licensed Agfa technology and font outlines forintegration into PCL 5 printers: Gestetner, Printronix, Star Micronics andXerox.andM;Agfa also announced expansion of its cross-licensing agreement with Monotypeto enable a select group of Monotype faces (Baskerville, Albertus, Gill Sansand Times New Roman) to be made available for PCL 5 devices.andM;New DirectSet for PCL.andP;  Agfa also announced PCL 5 support for itsGenics-based DirectSet imagesetter, providing high-resolution (1,200- or2,400-dpi) output of PCL 5 files that alternatively can be printed onLaserJet machines.andP;  The Agfa Genics RIP, in which the PCL 5 software resides,also supports Compugraphic's own command language.andM;A PCL 4 version has been available since last year.andP;  The Level 5 version willbe ready for installations in 1991, priced at $4,995 in the U.S.andP;  Upgradesfor Level 4 customers will cost $1,500 in the U.S.andM;PostScript fonts on CD-ROM.andP;  Agfa also announced a new version of its 600-MBCD-ROM with more than 1,100 PostScript screen and printer fonts, includingnearly 700 from Adobe, 134 Agfa original designs with Adobe hints, 352 Type 3PostScript fonts and 48 fonts for office publishing with the HP DeskWriter.andM;Type-related programs included on the disk are Master Juggler, Altsys's ArtImporter (for creating logo libraries in the form of PostScript fonts) andMetamorphosis (Type 3 to Type 1 converter), TypeStyler and LetraStudio.andM;Altsys to support Windows, NewsPrintandM;Altsys said that it is working on a Windows version of Fontographer and willprobably have it finished next summer.andP;  The firm has also announced supportfor Sun's NewsPrint environment and F3 fonts; no shipping date or productdetails were discussed.andM;Bitstream garners support for SpeedoandM;Bitstream announced a new licensee for its technology: Interleaf, which willbuild the Speedo font rasterizer into the Interleaf 5 software.andP;  Interleaf 5will run on a variety of Unix platforms, on Macintosh and on '386 PCs.andP;  (Seethe Seybold Report on Publishing Systems, Vol.andP;  20, No.andP;  2, for an in-depthlook at Interleaf 5.)andM;New Mac library.andP;  In addition, Bitstream announced that it plans to releaseversion 2 of the Bitstream Typeface Library for Macintosh later this fall.andO;Version 2 fonts will be in hinted Type 1 format and thus will work with AdobeType Manager.andM;The new version will also use a revised naming convention.andP;  The letters &quot;BT&quot;(for Bitstream) will appear at the end of each font name, assuring that fontnames are unambiguous and that the correct font is always used in PostScriptprinters.andP;  In addition, the fonts will come with linked suitcase files.andP;  Thenew suitcases make Bitstream fonts fully compatible with Adobe Type Reunion(and presumably with Linotype Accordion as well).andM;Bitstream will use its new naming convention with the TrueType fonts that itis developing for Apple's System 7 and with future Bitstream products for PCenvironments.andM;With the Mac fonts, Bitstream is bundling a desk accessory called BitstreamAnalogue, a cross-reference tool for font names.andP;  For each font in theBitstream library, Analogue shows the names of corresponding fonts from otherfoundries.andP;  It also gives the font name in version 1 of the Mac font library,the PostScript name, the font menu name and the Apple ID number.andP;  The DA alsogives an explanation of Bitstream's type classification scheme, which groupsfonts by common design characteristics.andM;The upgrade will be free to customers who bought fonts after October 4.andP;  Itwill also be free (except for a shipping charge) to anyone who owns theentire Bitstream library.andP;  Other customers will have to pay something, butnot very much.andP;  Bitstream says that the price depends on the total number oftypefaces purchased, but that no upgrade will cost more than $5/typeface.andM;Facelift for WordPerfect.andP;  Bitstream has added a version of FaceLift forWordPerfect 5.0 and 5.1.andP;  It will be packaged with 13 Speedo fonts: fourweights of Swiss and Dutch, plus Park Avenue, Cooper Black, Formal Script,Brush Script and a monospaced version of Swiss.andP;  The suggested list pricewill be $99.andM;The fonts-on-the-fly software will use less than 50K of RAM.andP;  If you haveexpanded memory, only 10K need be in low memory.andP;  The program can beconfigured as a TSR so that it will reside in memory at all times.andM;Bitstream also emphasized that its packaging is now &quot;green.&quot;andP;  That is,there's no plastic wrapper on the box, and all packaging is biodegradable.andM;Broderbund enhances TypeStylerandM;When we reviewed Broderbund's TypeStyler a year ago, we noted its extremelycomprehensive facilities for manipulating type to create special effects, butwe criticized the way one key feature had been implemented.andP;  When changeswere made to text within a container or frame, the system automaticallycondensed or expanded the type to make it continue to fit in the same sizecontainer.andP;  In other words, if you removed a word or a letter from the text,all remaining characters would be expanded correspondingly to take up thespace that resulted from removing some text.andP;  From the viewpoint of atypographer, this situation is untenable, as we said in our review.andP;  Not onlyis it heretical to distort type based on happenstance, rather than onplanning, but it also makes it impossible to match the character widths ofmultiple blocks of text if one or more of them have been modified in thisway.andM;Broderbund addressed this issue in version 1.5 of TypeStyler.andP;  It is nowpossible to specify that the point size of type remain fixed when adjustmentsare made, in which case the container changes shape instead of the type.andP;  (Itmight have been better to call it a fixed width or set size, rather thanfixed point size, but the terminology isn't as important as the function.)andM;The one aggravation that remains with this feature is that the program alwaysdefaults to the functionality that we dislike.andP;  That is, every time a changeis made to the text in a container, the system presumes that the operatorwants to condense or expand the type, even if the operator stated otherwisewhen the container was created.andP;  Thus, every time text is edited, kerningpairs are adjusted, word spacing is changed, or anything else is done tomodify the size of text in the container, the operator has to click on abutton to ask the system not to distort the type.andM;We would rather see the program default to the setting specified when thecontainer was created.andP;  In other words, if a container is created as afixed-size element, the default should honor that request throughout theprocessing of that text block.andP;  Or the program could default to the mostrecently specified procedure, whether it is changing the character width orchanging the container size.andM;Other changes.andP;  Although the fixed-point-size feature was the most importantone to us, the new release also has many other enhancements:andM;* Shaping options.andP;  Previously, when frames were distorted, individualcharacters were likely to be distorted in unusual ways.andP;  Now it is possibleto restrain them within four ways: rectangular, in which case each letterfits in its own rectangle; parallel, in which case the bounding box of eachcharacter is parallel to that of every other character; squared, which issimilar to parallel, but characters also are perpendicular to the baseline;and flexible, with no constraints, as in the previous version of the program.andO;A final consideration is the &quot;precision mapping,&quot; which enables the tops andbottoms of characters either to be angled straight lines (left) or to becurved (right).andM;* Improved WYSIWYG.andP;  Because of an earlier discrepancy between the way thickinline and outline effects were displayed and printed, the screen versiondidn't reflect final output accurately.andP;  That problem has been fixed.andM;* Rotation.andP;  In addition to the existing free rotation tool, Broderbund hasadded the ability to rotate elements by specifying the number of degrees in adialog box.andM;* Family-built fonts.andP;  With version 1.5, all styles present in afamily-builtfont can be accessed, rather than just the basic style.andM;* Flipping flexibility.andP;  Six different means of flipping an object areavailable--three that flip the entire object (horizontally, vertically orboth) and three that flip only the shape.andP;  With circles, the horizontal andvertical flips are replaced by baseline and direction flips, which accomplishsimilar purposes.andM;* Suspend refreshing during shaping.andP;  If several control points are beingmoved, the operator now can halt repainting of the screen until all pointsare moved, rather than waiting for the redisplay after each movement.andM;* Spot color separations.andP;  Objects can be printed in four separate planes(except with QuickDraw printers).andM;* Labeled line weights.andP;  Line weights are labeled according to thickness:hairline, 1 pt., 2 pts., etc.andM;* Setting the shape height.andP;  To achieve better alignment of the tops ofcharacters, the program can be asked to use the cap height, rather than thepoint size, to align characters.andM;Files created using older versions of TypeStyler are compatible with 1.5.andP;  Insome situations, type might look different with the new version.andP;  In thiscase, the operator has the option of accepting the new look or of retainingthe old one--a nice addition not often found with new versions of products.andM;Broderbund has done a nice job with documentation, including usefulillustrations and good explanations of the new features.andM;Image Club cuts pricesandM;Image Club sells CD-ROM discs containing fonts and clip art.andP;  TheMacintosh-based font product, LetterPress, holds 600 PostScript fonts, eachone provided in Type 1, Type 3 and outline format.andP;  This CD isn't locked bypasswords, but it is priced at $3,999 (down from $4,999).andM;Image Club reported that it is in the process of finishing the PC versions ofits font line and that it plans to put all of those fonts onto a CD-ROM, asit has done with the Mac fonts.andP;  It is also struggling to finish Evolution,its Mac-based Type 3 to Type 1 font converter.andM;The firm also announced a price cut in its other Macintosh CD-ROM product, aclip-art library called Art andamp; Type Vendor.andP;  The new price is $99, whichincludes 20 fonts and one clip-art volume.andP;  There is plenty of additionalmaterial on the CD, but you have to buy passwords from Image Club to unlockthe other chunks of it.andM;PostCraft debuts Effects SpecialistandM;When Postcraft set about upgrading its Laser fx Macintosh font manipulationprogram, it ended up rewriting it to such an extent that it now has a newproduct, Effects Specialist.andP;  The three-year-old Laser fx is still availablefor $90, with a Windows 3.0 version due early in 1991, but Effects Specialistis likely to become the key product.andP;  It is expected to be released by theend of December for $200.andM;Effects Specialist fits in the same general market as Br0derbund'sTypeStyler, Letraset's Letrastudio and Emerald City's SmartArt.andP;  It issimilar to SmartArt in that users pick a prepackaged effect and thencustomize it; however, it has many more effects than SmartArt (120 startereffects in color).andP;  An advantage for SmartArt is that it runs as a deskaccessory, not as a separate program, as is the case with Effects Specialist.andM;In general, Effects Specialist provides greater flexibility in manipulatingtype--with a consistent user interface to make it easy to take advantage ofthe capabilities.andP;  We especially like the screen &quot;help&quot; feature thatidentifies each element of each effect with an arrow and a label to helpdifferentiate, for example, between an &quot;outline shade,&quot; an &quot;outside shade&quot;and an &quot;ExtLine shade,&quot; not to mention the &quot;inline shade,&quot; &quot;inside shade&quot; and&quot;depth shade&quot; that also can be modified.andM;Another key advantage Effects Specialist has over SmartArt is that it isbased on the procedure of first typing the text of a headline and thenapplying an effect.andP;  With SmartArt, the effects has to be selected first andthen the text entered.andP;  In the latter scenario, it is obviously impossible totry different effects on the same block of text, a limitation not presentwith Effects Specialist.andM;Effects.andP;  As noted above, Effects Specialist includes 120 effects.andP;  Next tothe directory, the program provides a nice example of each effect to give anidea of what it does.andP;  It's a good thing, too.andP;  Otherwise, how would you knowwhat to expect from one called &quot;Action&quot;?andP;  Or how about Bunker, Cheers,Chroma, Drop in, Route 66, Scientific, St. Catharines or Tesseract?andM;Trying to figure these all out without the sample surely would lead to:andM;FrustrationandM;Many of the names, though, are nearly self explanatory.andP;  Music aligns letterson a staff.andP;  Alcatraz applies to the text the striped pattern of a prisonuniform.andP;  Bird Tracks forms letters with the scratchy shapes that a bird'sfeet (not its droppings) leave in the sand.andP;  Centipede rings each letter withhundreds of little feet.andP;  Clipper (in one of the potentially more usefuleffects) employs clipped text characters as the fill pattern for an outlinefont.andP;  Earthquake splits the headline with a jagged crack down the middle(and enables each half of the text to be modified independently).andP;  Fireworksapplies a background of exploding sparklers.andM;Fun House distorts letters in a fashion similar to that of a wavy mirror.andO;Hotdog splits the text into a long, open roll into which another block oftext can be inserted.andP;  Hummingbird, Pinwheel and Propeller create, distortand rotate text into the shapes of the objects their names describe.andP;  Orbitforms text in a three-dimensional circle.andP;  Relax and Hypnotize are remarkablysimilar--perhaps not unexpectedly.andP;  Postcraft did manage to make a cleardistinction between Shaky and Vibrate.andP;  The one that outdoes the rest intrying to make the text look like its effect--to the extent that it can'teven be read--is this one:andM;(If you can't figure what this is and care enough to inquire, don't call us;call Postcraft: [805] 257-1797.)andM;Unlike SmartArt, which generates a WYSIWYG preview of the actual text of theeffect in the directory as it is scrolled, PostScraft shows only an example,using its own text.andP;  It won't provide a view of the text that has been typed.andO;That can be seen on the screen after the file is processed.andM;Many of these effects may seem too far-fetched to be of much use, butsomewhere out there, there must be someone who needs them.andP;  Like clip art(and, to a certain extent, fonts), after the society's basic needs have beenmet, the library grows more with the imagination of the creators than withthe practical needs of the masses.andM;Customizing effects.andP;  Once you've chosen a starter effect, you can customizeit using pulldown icons that change the color, shade percentage, drop shadowsand line thickness of the various borders and fills.andP;  You can also change theangle, rotate, skew and stretch the effect.andM;You can create several effects on the same page.andP;  Background templates alsowill be provided for full-page documents such as calendars and flyers.andO;Effects Specialist can print to laser, color and dot-matrix printers.andP;  Theprogram was too preliminary for us to test some of the features.andP;  We'llprepare a full reveiw after it has been delivered to initial customers.andM;Starburst, Inc.andP;  One effect that we didn't see in the Effects Specialistcollection was the ability to create a starburst, used commonly inadvertising and offered with some competitive programs.andP;  However, Postcraftdid demonstrate a template designer from a company called Starburst Inc.,andO;which was in the booth.andP;  Postcraft announced a cooperative deal to marketStarburst templates for PAgeMaker (both PC and Mac), Xpress and DesignStudio.andM;Vital LaserTYpe: aesthetic condensingandM;Like many a firm in the signmaking and silkscreening business, VitalLaserType frequently needed to condense a font--sometimes quite heavily--tomake the message fit.andP;  And because desktop publishing systems offer powerfultype condensing functions, it was one of the early adopters of laser printersand Macintoshes.andP;  But it soon became apparent that the way most desktoppublishing programs handled condensed type, by scaling the x-axis whileleaving the y-axis alone, seriously damaged the appearance of the lettering.andO;The vertical stems got thin while the horizontal stems stayed fat.andP;  As JoeDeSimone, Vital LaserType's VP of sales, put it, a letter T ended up looking&quot;like a loaf of bread on a toothpick.&quot;andM;Vital LaserType devised a solution: code the PostScript font so that verticalstems get thicker as the degree of compression goes up.andP;  The net effect isthat the letterforms stay closer to the original design.andP;  The firm hasprepared several sans-serif fonts using its coding technique:andM;* Utility, a Helvetica workalike;andM;* Frank (Frankfurter); andandM;* Invogue (Intertype's Vogue).andM;In addition, Vital LaserType has coded three slab-serif designs:andM;* Fullblock;andM;* Title Block; andandM;* Collegiate.andM;The firm has not done any serif faces, saying that three is much less benefitthere; the vertical and horizontal strokes of serif fonts are supposed tovary.andM;Vital LaserType calls its approach &quot;Aesthetically Alterable Fonts&quot; (AA Fontsfor short) and has obtained a patent on the technology.andP;  The company iswilling to discuss licensing arrangements with other font foundries.andP;  So far,it has prepared only Mac fonts, but it will release versions for MS-DOSmachines in the first quarter of 1991.andM;There are some limitations to AA Fonts.andP;  First, the technology only works forcondensing, not expanding, the type.andP;  Second, these are unhinted Type 3fonts, so they will not work with Adobe Type Manager.andP;  (On the other hand,they will work with clone printers.)andP;  Type 1 fonts are restricted to a smallsubset of the PostScript commands, and we suspect that AA Fonts need to usecommands that are outside that subset.andM;Vital LaserType is charging $199 per font, which includes a small range ofscreen bitmaps.andP;  It is hoping to set up distributors, but in the meantime itis selling the fonts itself.andM;Vital LaserType, 591 Camino de la Reina, Suite 1025, San Diego, CA 92108;phone (619) 543-0789 or toll-free (800) SOS-FONT.andM;Zenographics' many font formatsandM;Zenographics' latest product is a windows 3.0 printer driver calledSuperPrint.andP;  It generates printer fonts on the fly from outlines in AdobeType 1, Bitstream Fontware and Speedo, Agfa CG Intellifont and DTC Nimbus Qformats.andP;  It also can handle HP Soft Font bitmaps.andM;We see this as an example of the direction other vendors will have to take:multiple rasterizers that are invoked as required.andP;  The demo we saw ranreasonably quickly; one reason is that it only rasterizes the characters thatare actually needed rather than entire alphabets.andM;Bundled with the program are a print spooler and a screen fontgenerator/manager.andP;  The package, including drivers for 9-and 24-pindot-matrix printers and Canon laser printers, is priced at $195.andP;  Versionsfor color printers from Tektronix, Mitsubishi and CalComp and for thePresentation Technologies Mirage FR1 slide recorder are priced at $395.andM;Zenographic also offers a set of 22 scalable fonts for use with SuperPrintand Windows.andP;  These are width-matched to the fonts in Apple's LaserWriterPlus.andP;  The package is priced at $195 and includes four weights each of ITCAvant Garde, ITC Bookman, Century Schoolbook, Palermo (a Palatino lookalike)and Nimbus Sans Narrow (Narrow Helvetica by another name).andP;  It also has theITC Zapf Dingbats and ITC Zapf Chancery fonts.andM;Zenographics, 4 Executive Cir., Irvine, CA 92714; phone (714) 851-6352.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
