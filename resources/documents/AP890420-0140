About 1,000 students marched in the central Chinese city ofNanjing, and students in Tianjin, a port city east of Beijing,plastered posters on walls. Other marches were also reported inShanghai, Wuhan and Hefei, but details were sketchy.   Nationally televised news led with a stern warning that theprotests, the biggest since the pro-democracy demonstrations of1986-87, would no longer be tolerated.   ``These activities have gone beyond the limits of the law andthe taking of harsh measures to end the disturbances has becomenecessary,'' the announcer said, quoting from an editorial by theofficial Xinhua News Agency.   ``These protesters do not really care about the future orhappiness of China, all they want to do is overthrow the CommunistParty and the government,'' the editorial said.   The protests were prompted by the death Saturday of Hu Yaobang,an outspoken reformer who was ousted as Communist Party chief in1987. Hu was accused of encouraging liberal ideas and failing tocrack down on the 1986-87 student demonstrators.   The Beijing city government issued regulations that restrictedcommemoration activities for Hu to inside universities, businessesand factories.   The regulations also said ``rioters and other lawbreakers wouldbe dealt with severely, according to the law.''   Early Thursday, thousands of security forces rushed into crowdsof students as they protested near the headquarters of the rulingCommunist Party.   Student organizers said security forces beat more than 200students, injuring about 40. Between 40 and 50 were arrested, theysaid.   There was no official report on the arrests or injuries, butAssociated Press reporters witnessed several beatings anddetainments.   Thursday afternoon, students from several universities marchedfor hours under heavy rain to Tiananmen Square, the symbolic centerof Chinese political life.   In the evening, they rallied around the huge obeliskcommemorating China's revolutionary heroes, now draped witheulogies and portraits of Hu.   ``The blood of our classmates will not be shed in vain,'' saidone student leader. ``Since the time of the first emperor 2,000years ago China has been living under a dictatorship. It is timefor this to end.''   Students huddled closely under tattered umbrellas as the windand rain howled about them.   Student speakers said they were demanding that officiallycontrolled student unions at their schools be disbanded andreplaced with democratic organizations.   The student demands formulated Monday include free speech, afree press, more money for education and disclosure by officials oftheir incomes and bank accounts.   ``We don't oppose specific people, we oppose dictatorship,'' onespeaker said Thursday evening. But some students have singled outsenior leader Deng Xiaoping, who has failed to satisfyintellectuals' demands for political reform.   Turnout was much lower than for previous days' activities, whichpeaked when about 6,000 students rallied before about 20,000onlookers, then marched on party headquarters late Wednesday andearly Thursday.   By 9:30 p.m., the protesters, drenched with rain and chilled bya cool breeze, began to march back to their universities.   As the protesters returned home, hundreds of police officerscame out of hiding and poured into buses and trucks that left thesquare. Some security forces were armed with rifles, the first timearms have been openly displayed during the protests.   In Nanjing, about 1,000 students set out Thursday night fromNanjing University toward the Jiangsu provincial governmentoffices, said an American teacher at the school on condition ofanonymity.   It was not clear whether they reached the offices. The teachersaid a similar number of students marched Wednesday night for aboutfour hours, carrying banners and chanting, ``Down withdictatorship!''   A Chinese student from Nankai University in Tianjin said thewalls of his schools were plastered with posters and poems callingfor democracy.</TEXT></DOC>
