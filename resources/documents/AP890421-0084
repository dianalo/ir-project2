Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani announced during a weeklyprayer session at Tehran University that a large number of thespies have been arrested in recent weeks, according to Iran'sofficial Islamic Republic News Agency reported, monitored inNicosia.   He claimed the arrests have exposed the entire CIA operation inthe Middle East. Rafsanjani said the Americans ``should haverealized that ... this country is no place for coups.''   In Washington, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater saidhe had no information on the spy allegations.   ``My information is we don't really know what they're talkingabout. They make similar claims every once in a while aboutAmerican spies when they need a little attention,'' Fitzwater said.   Rafsanjani said some of the spies were Iranian navy personnelwho transmitted intelligence on Iranian naval deployments to theU.S. Navy ``when they were fighting us in the Persian Gulf.''   He said the Iranian ship Iran Ajr, which was attacked andboarded by U.S. forces in the gulf on Sept. 21, 1987 as it waslaying mines, was ``betrayed by these very people.''   Rafsanjani said the arrests included ``big American spies'' whowere now being interrogated. He did not say how many people wererounded up because ``the Americans should not know how many havebeen trapped. There are too many.'' But he stressed that the navyofficers who had allegedly spied for the Americans ``arefortunately still alive.''   He claimed the Americans ``have announced these people have beenexecuted, because they are not aware of their whereabouts.''   Rafsanjani did not name the navy men. But dissident Iraniansources reported recently that three senior navy officers wereexecuted in early April for plotting to overthrow the government.   They were identified as Adm. Kianoosh Hakimi, commander of navalcommunications and joint operations with the air force; Adm.Ghahreman Malezzadeh, naval representative at the chief of staff'soffice; and Adm. Farhad Riahi, commander of the airborne units.   The sources said that about 20 other pro-Western navy officershad been arrested on charges of spying.   The Iranian news agency said the thousands of Shiite Moslemworshipers around the campus in downtown Tehran chanted: ``Americanspies must be executed.'' Rafsanjani vowed that ``God's decree willbe carried out'' and that the alleged spies would be punished.   He did not elaborate. But Iranian authorities have executedhundreds of political dissidents and alleged drug smugglers inrecent months.   Iran's news agency said Rafsanjani disclosed that ``numerousespionage dens and networks'' set up since the 1979 Islamicrevolution had been discovered ``in various places and sensitiveparts of the country.''   He added: ``We have sustained losses from them during the war(with Iraq) and in recent days.''   Rafsanjani's disclosure came amid a resurgence of radicalfundamentalism in which hardliners led by Interior Minister AliAkbar Mohtashemi have gained control of the Tehran hierarchy at theexpense of so-called pragmatists like Rafsanjani.   The disclosure appeared to be designed to stir anti-Westernsentiment at a time when Iran is gripped by political uncertaintyand serious economic difficulties in the post-war period.   The alleged discovery of U.S. spy cells comes amid a reportedlywidespread purge in the armed forces and other power centers inIran as the hardliners gained strength after Khomeini's drive torekindle revolutionary fervor.</TEXT></DOC>
