Robert Dole out of a debate with Ronald Reagan. &quot;George,&quot; Mr. Dole fumed, &quot;there'll be another day.&quot;    That day may be drawing closer. As campaigning for the nation's first presidential primary reaches its final weekend, the movement in the Republican Party is plainly toward Mr. Dole. In a state once considered an impregnable Bush redoubt, victory is clearly within the senator's reach. Some tracking polls already indicate that the Kansas Republican could even have pulled ahead.    Stunned by an embarrassing third-place finish behind Sen. Dole and religious broadcaster Pat Robertson in the Iowa caucuses Monday and gasping for a chance to display strength and leadership, the Bush campaign is on the defensive. Its superior organization is in danger of being neutralized by a flood of voters abandoning the Bush camp.    But as Mr. Dole picks up momentum and his campaign generates enthusiasm, Vice President Bush is making few adjustments in his own effort. &quot;We've been knocked down,&quot; says William Cahill, Mr. Bush's New Hampshire spokesman. &quot;But that's where our organization is going to make the difference. No 11th-hour media blitzes or issue twists or last-minute theatrics is going to do it. We're steady as you go.&quot;    With his campaign here sputtering and his national effort in peril, Mr. Bush is stressing education and his ties to President Reagan. A new campaign brochure, which includes a picture of the vice president holding a hunting rifle, urges Granite State voters to &quot;give George Bush the same trust given him by Ronald Reagan.&quot; A television advertisement, seeking to draw the distinction between the &quot;presidential leadership&quot; of Mr. Bush and the congressional experience of Mr. Dole, shows Mr. Bush strolling pensively outside the White House with Mr. Reagan, the president's arm gently around the vice president's back.    Meanwhile, Rep. Jack Kemp of New York, the fourth-place finisher in Iowa, is making perhaps his last stand in a state whose rugged mien and refusal to enact any general taxes ordinarily might be congenial to him. Instead, the attention is on Messrs. Dole and Bush, although this week Mr. Kemp did win the endorsement of the Concord Monitor, a newspaper with a maverick streak that in 1984 prompted it, alone among the state's dailies, to endorse Gary Hart, the eventual surprise Democratic winner.    In recent days Mr. Kemp has been arguing that &quot;Bob Dole never met a tax he didn't hike and George Bush has gone along with every tax Bob Dole's passed.&quot; But the other day, Mr. Kemp appeared with 16 members of Congress on the steps of the state capitol in Concord, attracted 13 TV cameras but failed to win even a cameo appearance on the networks.    &quot;The new front-runner is wrong on every issue for New Hampshire,&quot; Kemp spokesman John Buckley says of Mr. Dole. &quot;Our challenge this week is getting covered.&quot;    Mr. Robertson is facing no such challenge. His strong showing in Iowa has catapulted him into the limelight and GOP leaders, assembled at a Lincoln Day dinner here, acknowledged he may be right when he told them, &quot;You are looking at the only conservative who is going all the way to the convention.&quot;    Many analysts here believe Mr. Robertson won't fare as well in New Hampshire, which is, as state Rep. Robert Scott of Windham put it, &quot;a conservative state but not an evangelical state.&quot; A Manchester Union Leader survey of local registrars showed no surge in registration that would signal a high turnout for Mr. Robertson. &quot;I see no army invading us,&quot; says Elsie Vartanian, the state GOP chairman.    But Mr. Robertson surprised party leaders in Iowa, and his strength remains one of the unknown elements here. His argument that Americans are &quot;tired of giving this country away to communism&quot; has much appeal in a state where Mr. Bush is regarded as, in the words of former Gov. Meldrim Thomson, &quot;an ultra-liberal one-worlder.&quot;    Mr. Robertson, whose campaign signs dominate the roadsides and hills of this state, has emerged as a reservoir for Republican protest. &quot;We're getting some of the 'none-of-the-above' vote,&quot; says Marc Nuttle, Mr. Robertson's chief strategist.    But Mr. Dole clearly has the offensive here. A week ago, he strolled quietly down the aisles and among the produce at Shaw's Supermarket in Concord; this week the entourage of television cameras, campaign aides and supporters trampled diners at a Burger King in Londonderry.    In an effort to protect his flank on the right, Sen. Dole has been reaffirming his opposition to increases in income tax rates. But he also has offered a plan to provide child-care grants to the states and is setting out a broader vision of his party and his country: &quot;I think you can be a good conservative and still be caring and compassionate about some people who are down and out.&quot;    Either Mr. Dole or his wife, former Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole, has been in the state every day but two for more than a month, and now Dole organizers are redoubling their efforts in Manchester, Concord, Nashua and Salem.    &quot;The effort is to make him appear less the legislator and more the executive who makes presidential decisions,&quot; says Thomas Rath, the top Dole strategist here. &quot;We want to demonstrate that he's not a captive of the Congress but the master of it.&quot;    Even so, the conservative Union Leader newspaper, which has endorsed former Gov. Pete du Pont of Delaware, shifted its fire from its longtime nemesis, Mr. Bush, to Mr. Dole. &quot;If you want a consummate politician, Bob Dole is your man, as shown by the parade of U.S. senators and hangers-on he has brought up here,&quot; publisher Nackey Loeb wrote in a front-page editorial yesterday.    The sixth candidate, former Secretary of State Alexander Haig, has made little progress here and could drop his campaign as early as today.    As the race nears its conclusion, the candidates have taken on the tactics of their rivals.    When Mr. Bush, brandishing his New England ties, tried to establish himself as &quot;one of us,&quot; a notion Mr. Dole used to great advantage in Iowa, Mr. Dole responded, &quot;I don't think geography is so important. It's the other things that go into your life that make you one of us.&quot;    And now that Mr. Dole, who at times has found it convenient to put distance between himself and the president, is portraying himself as Mr. Reagan's indispensable ally on Capitol Hill, the Bush forces are striking back. &quot;In Iowa, he was bashing the hell out of Reagan,&quot; says Mr. Cahill. &quot;George Bush is not a pen pal of Reagan's, he's a partner.&quot;    (See related story: &quot;...While 2 Democrats Claw Desperately for 2nd Place&quot; -- WSJ Feb. 12, 1988)</TEXT></DOC>
