(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A small federal courtroom became the stagetoday for the latest episode in the Jim Bakker story _ his trial oncharges he cheated his PTL ministry out of $4 million to finance alavish lifestyle.   ``Our faith is in God,'' Bakker proclaimed as he arrived at thecourthouse accompanied by his daughter, Tammy Sue Chapman, andattorney George T. Davis. ``I'm glad to have my daughter with me.''   The television evangelist, ousted from his PTL empire two yearsago, entered the courthouse and said nothing more to reporterswaiting outside.   About 70 potential jurors were on hand as the selection got underway. No one was seated this morning. U.S. District Court JudgeRobert Potter dismissed four potential jurors, two who said they hadopinions they couldn't overcome in the case, one who was a diabeticand one who was excused because of unspecified business reasons.   Potter told the jury pool there had been ``a lot of publicityabout this case'' and asked jurors if they ``would be willing tohave yourself convicted based on publicity.''   ``What I'm trying to do is get you to put yourself in the placeof the defendant, who has had a lot of publicity in this case,''Potter added. ``It makes our job very difficult to find a jury.''   Bakker is charged with eight counts of mail fraud, 15 counts ofwire fraud, and conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud. Ifconvicted on all counts, he could be sentenced to 120 years inprison and fined more than $5 million.   As the trial opened, Bakker's wife, Tammy Faye Bakker, stayed inOrlando, Fla., where Bakker transplanted his ministry, to carry ontheir daily live broadcast.   Mrs. Bakker opened the ``Jim and Tammy Show'' this morning withtears and exhorted listeners to pray for her husband.   ``We have such trouble things going on in Charlotte, N.C.,today,'' Mrs. Bakker said. It's like a circus in Charlotte, N.C. Idon't know how possibly Jim can get a fair trial in Charlotte,N.C.'' His attorneys have been pressing for a change of venue.   She blew a kiss on the air and said, ``I love you, sweetheart.Don't you dare give up.''   ``Not only is Jim on trial, people, but the church that we knowis on trial,'' Mrs. Bakker said. ``Everything that has to do withChristian television is on trial when Jim walks in that courtroom.''   Outside the fortress-like granite courthouse, there were noBakker supporters in sight. There were no Bakker detractors, either.   But there was 22-year-old Michael Williams, a former PTLsupporter and lunch truck operator who said he was there to ``get alittle bit of my money back'' by selling coffee and breakfastbiscuits to journalists and passers-by.   Opening arguments were scheduled to begin in a week, but defenseattorneys have renewed their motions to move the trial out ofCharlotte and the Western District of North Carolina because ofpretrial publicity.   U.S. Magistrate Paul Taylor rejected a similar motion earlier,saying publicity had died down in the two years since Bakker leftthe PTL ministry he founded. But Taylor said lawyers could renewtheir arguments before U.S. District Court Judge Robert Potterduring jury selection.   Bakker is charged with eight counts of mail fraud, 15 counts ofwire fraud, and conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud. Ifconvicted on all counts, he could be sentenced to 120 years inprison and ordered to pay more than $5 million in fines. Mrs. Bakkerisn't charged.   Bakker and his attorneys have declined to discuss their defensestrategy.   But the evangelist has said he knew little about PTL's finances.``I was a pastor, and a businessman I was not.''   Bakker, who left the PTL television empire during a sex-and-moneyscandal in 1987, relocated earlier this year to a nearly emptyshopping center in Orlando. The show is carried by severaltelevision stations.   The Bakkers have asked viewers to contribute $1 million for adefense fund. In a letter to supporters two months ago, Mrs. Bakkersaid half of that amount had to be raised by the end of the month.   Officials of Jim and Tammy Ministries have declined to say howmuch has been raised, except to say that supporters have respondedto the appeal.   It was earlier appeals for $1,000 donations to buy ``lifetimepartnerships'' at PTL that landed Bakker in federal court.   Prosecutors say he and top aides diverted more than $4 million ofthe $158 million contributed under various partnership programs totheir personal uses.   In eight of the 11 partnerships, contributors were promised freelodging at the ministry's Heritage USA Christian retreat and themepark at Fort Mill, S.C., in exchange for their one-time donation of$1,000.   But investigators say donations were spent on the ministry'sday-to-day operating costs and to finance the lavish lifestyles ofPTL executives rather than the mammoth hotel projects Bakkerpromoted on his television show.   Richard Dortch, Bakker's former top assistant at the now-defunctPTL, pleaded guilty to four charges of fraud and conspiracy Aug. 8and agreed to testify against his former boss.   The trial is expected to focus on the Bakkers' lifestyle, muchlike the trial of James and David Taggart, two former aides who wereconvicted last month of income tax evasion. The two brothers, whoface up to 25 years in prison and $1 million in fines each, arescheduled to be sentenced Friday.   They were convicted of diverting $1.1 million in ministry fundsto finance European trips, fur coats, matching Jaguar cars, Cartierjewelry, expensive furniture and an apartment in Manhattan's TrumpTower.   Bakker resigned in March 1987 after The Charlotte Observerinformed him it was ready to publish a story saying the ministrypaid hush money to prevent former New York church secretary JessicaHahn from talking about her 1980 tryst with Bakker.   Bakker turned the ministry over to the Rev. Jerry Falwell, whoput PTL under bankruptcy protection three months later after hisstaff discovered alleged financial irregularities and millions ofdollars in debts.   Potter told potential jurors that a number of people werepotential witnesses, including Dortch; former PTL board member EfremZimbalist Jr., an actor; the Taggarts; and Mrs. Bakker. Neither Ms.Hahn or Falwell was mentioned.</TEXT></DOC>
