<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-27-1105 </DOCNO><TEXT>Methods are presented for calculating classical periodic trajectoriesin a two-dimensional non-integrable potential problem. The main one isthe monodromy method, which consists in refining an approximate solutionby using a ''once-around-the-trajectory'' procedure. This can be doneeither for a given period or for a given energy. Other methods proceedby searching on the initial conditions until the trajectory closes. Wealso discuss how to find new periodic families, particularly branchingsfrom already known families, and how to get started when no familiesare known.</TEXT></DOC>
