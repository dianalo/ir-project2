Estimates of the generation lifetimein the processed wafers ranged from 5 to 30 ms. The diffusion currentinjected at the base contact was often larger than the generation componentand both were spatially variable. The behaviour of the diffusion componentimplied a base contact interface generation velocity falling to valuesnear 10/sup 4/ mm/s or lower in places.</TEXT></DOC>
