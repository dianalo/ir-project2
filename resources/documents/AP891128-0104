McCLAIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The U.S. trade deficit, after improving forsix months, deteriorated slightly to $27.75 billion in the thirdquarter, fed by America's appetite for imported goods and by flatexports, the government reported Tuesday.   Analysts do not see much improvement in the near future. Importsmay drop somewhat because of a slowing U.S. economy, they say, butexports also are likely to fall because of a strong dollar andmoderating economies overseas.   The Commerce Department said the gap between imports and U.S.exports edged up 0.7 percent in the July-September quarter from thesecond quarter's $27.55 billion. The April-June gap deficit was thenarrowest since a $27.7 billion imbalance in the first quarter of1985.   Imports posted a 0.3 percent gain to a record $119.3 billion,while exports rose only 0.2 percent to $91.6 billion, also arecord. Both imports and exports have reached record levels duringeach of the last five quarters.   But analysts worry that exports, which sustained much of theU.S. economy last year, will remain unchanged in the months ahead.   ``The trade report substantiates what we've already seen ...export growth simply has flattened out after booming previously andis a major source of the wave of weakness rippling through the U.S.economy, particularly the manufacturing sector,'' commented AllenSinai, chief economist of The Boston Co.   Samuel D. Kahan, chief financial economist for Kleinwort BensonGovernment Securities Inc. in Chicago, agreed that the pace ofexports is ``probably coming to the end of its run due to thedollar.''   A stronger dollar makes U.S. goods more expensive and thus lesscompetitive overseas, while making imported goods cheaper and thusmore attractive to American buyers.   Kahan also suggested that ``as the (British) economy slows,which seems likely, and some of the other industrial countries,particuarly Japan, moderate their (economic) activity, that shouldhurt our exports.''   Sinai also said that ``as the U.S. economy weakens more, as willprobably be the case over the next few quarters, imports too willprobably decline.''   But Lawrence Chimerine, senior economic advisor for the WEFAGroup in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., pointed to the high level of oilimports, which he said will continue and further aggravate thetrade deficit.   The Commerce Department said the average number of barrelsimported daily increased 8.5 percent to 8.65 million barrels in thethird quarter _ the highest level since the third quarter of 1977.   But despite the increase, oil imports showed a July-Septembernumerical decrease of 1 percent because of lower prices. Theaverage price per barrel fell from $18.46 to $16.85.   Non-oil imports rose 0.5 percent to $106 billion, led byconsumer goods, including clothing and household goods. Imports ofindustrial supplies and materials fell while both capital goods andautomotive products were virtually unchanged.   Non-farm exports increased 2 percent to a record $81.8 billion.The sector was boosted by shipments of capital goods, includingaircraft and parts to Western Europe, Japan and newlyindustrialized countries in the Far East.   Shipments of non-farm products such as industrial supplies andmaterials and automotive parts fell. Farm products also fell, down10 percent to $9.8 billion.   For the first nine months of the year, the overall deficit wasrunning at an annual rate of $111.6 billion, down 12.3 percent fromthe $127.2 billion trade gap registered in all of 1988.   Today's report on merchandise trade, which is calculated on abalance of payment basis, is slightly different from the CommerceDepartment's monthly merchandise trade reports because it excludesU.S. military sales to foreign governments and makes other minoradjustments in the monthly figures. </TEXT></DOC>
