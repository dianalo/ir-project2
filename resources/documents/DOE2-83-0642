Key factorsthat affected the industry were the failure of expected high demand growthto materialize, rapid increase in construction costs, the emergence ofenvironmental concerns relative to generation and transmission facilities,increases in worldwide price of fossil-fuels, conservation legislation,and problems in the nuclear power industry. Both ``Least-Cost Planning''and ``Demand-Side Management'' represent utility efforts to improve systemefficiency through closer matching of electricity supply and demand.Among utilities, Least-Cost Planning is a strategic resource planningconcept which compares the cost/benefit of ``demand-reducing'' and ``capacityenhancing'' options to that of constructing new power plants. Demand-sidemanagement involves development of end-use programs to influence theexpected load shape. A central concern for analysts engaged in theseactivities is how to integrate the consumer's energy service needs withthe utilities' system requirements so as to optimize ``quality, reliability,and stable electricity prices''. In this context, the primary objectivesof the Utility Overview Study are to: Provide an estimate of where andwhen utilities are likely to be interested in promoting energy conservationas an alternative to energy exchange arrangements or construction ofnew plants to meet future energy demand; provide a framework for relatingthe conclusions of LBL utility case studies on financial impacts of energyconservation to the national context. 30 refs., 6 figs., 5 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
