At the Tamdem Van de Graff at the University of Tokyo two samplepreparation methods are currently used and the method of direct carbonizationof organic material can give dating of as old as sixty thousand years.However, dating is limited to 35 thousand years for the method that requiresthe reduction of CO/sub 2/ into amorphous carbon, possibly due to contaminationby the modern carbon. In the present work, in order to improve the lattermethod, the amount of modern carbon contamination was determined forvarious chemicals used in the sample preparation ; namely, the carboncontent in the metallic Mg used as the reducing agent was determinedby charged particle activation analysis, and the /sup 14/C contents inorganic solvents used for washing the glass ware, in the rotary pumpoil, and in the metallic Mg were determined by AMS. Based on the knowledgeof those results, a greaseless vacuum line with several cold traps wasnewly built for the sample preparation, and the dating limit of 46 thousandyears could be achieved by use of the highly pure Mg that contained 6ppm C.</TEXT></DOC>
