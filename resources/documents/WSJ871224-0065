Statistics Canada, a federal agency, said yesterday that the country's gross domestic product rose an inflation-adjusted 0.5% in October from September.    The October gain was the ninth consecutive monthly increase in Canada's gross domestic product, which is the total value of the output of the country's goods and services. The October GPD was 5.1% above the level in January.    In the past two years, Canada has been growing faster than most other Western industrial nations. Its growth for much of this year has been led by rising consumer spending and increased business investment in plant and equipment. Retail sales in October were up for the third consecutive month, rising 1.7% from September.    Laurent Thibault, president of the Canadian Manufacturers' Association, predicted Canada's economic growth will slow next year to 2.5% from an estimated 3.75% this year. He said next year's slower growth will result from higher interest rates, reduced savings, heavier consumer debt and high housing prices, which will combine to depress consumer spending.    Roger Hamel, president of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, predicted that economic growth next year will slow to between 2% and 2.5%. He said the 1988 growth should create enough new jobs to match the increase in the labor force next year. In November, the unemployment rate was 8.2% of the work force, its lowest level since October 1981.    Both the chamber of commerce and manufacturers' association sharply criticized the federal government for not taking fuller advantage of the country's five-year-old economic expansion to make a bigger reduction of the government deficit. In the fiscal year ended March 31, the deficit was estimated at 30.6 billion Canadian dollars ($23.45 billion), down from 34.4 billion dollars a year earlier. Mr. Hamel said progress in reducing the budget deficit has been &quot;discouragingly slow.&quot; Mr. Thibault said the federal government's fiscal situation &quot;is still critical. The cost of financing the federal debt is increasing at a more rapid pace than the economy is expanding.&quot;    The federal debt problem has hampered the Conservative government's efforts to capitalize politically on the economic growth that has occurred since Prime Minister Brian Mulroney took office in September 1984. &quot;It is tough to get the good word out, but we try,&quot; Mr. Mulroney said earlier this week. He predicted that the Conservatives eventually will get recognition for their economic achievements and &quot;things will improve, both for the party and for me.&quot; The Conservatives have advanced in recent polls, but still trail the New Democratic and Liberal parties. </TEXT></DOC>
