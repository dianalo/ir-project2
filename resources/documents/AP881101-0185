DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal appeals court on Tuesday rejected theOneida Indian nation's claim on more than 5 million acres of land incentral New York state stretching from Canada to Pennsylvania.   The Indians were seeking to overturn the state's purchase of theland from their ancestors in 1785 and 1788, claiming those treatiesviolated an earlier treaty as well as the U.S. law in effect beforethe Constitution was ratified.   But the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, sitting in Manhattan,upheld a lower court ruling that found the treaties acquiring theland were valid.   The Oneidas, joined by four of the five other tribes thatcomprised the once-mighty Iroquois confederacy, sought to overturnthe treaties under which the land was sold.   In lawsuits first brought in 1978, they claimed the landpurchases were invalid because the individual states could not buythe Indians' land without the central government's permission.   In a 52-page opinion that quoted James Madison, Thomas Jeffersonand other founding fathers, the 2nd Circuit described the appeal as``unusual because it requires a federal court, perhaps for the firsttime, to determine whether actions of a state violated the Articlesof Confederation.''   The Articles of Confederation, which left most power in the handsof the 13 states, were in effect for nearly 10 years after theUnited States won its independence, before the Constitution wasadopted in 1789.   At issue in the Oneidas' lawsuit was a strip of land, 50 to 60miles wide, running through the heart of New York from the St.Lawrence River down to the Pennsylvania border. The 5{-million-acretract included parts of 12 counties.   Lawyer Allan vanGestel, who represented the 12 counties, saidthis decision is expected to end one of the largest Indian landclaims in the eastern United States and will also have a big impacton future Indian claims.   ``Essentially, the court had to interpret the meaning of theArticles of Confederation and what they said is that ... the statedid not have to get permission from the central government'' to buyland from the Indians, he said.   Arlinda Locklear, attorney for the Oneidas, called the ruling``legally wrong and morally wrong.''   Reached at her Knoxville, Md., office, she said she hadn't seenthe opinion yet but expected to seek either a rehearing by the 2ndCircuit or to petition the U.S. Supreme Court for a hearing.   She said the 13,000 Indians she represented had a ``strong moralclaim: the failure of the United States to protect the Oneidas intheir dealings with New York state. Essentially the 2nd Circuit saidthe words of the United States (in the treaty pre-dating the landpurchases) were meaningless.''   The lawsuits were brought by the Oneida Indian Nation of NewYork, the Oneida Indian Nation of Wisconsin and the Oneida of theThames Band, of Ontario, Canada.   One of the Six Nations of the Iroquois, the Oneidas were laterjoined in the suit by four of the remaining five: the Onondaga, theMohawks, the Senecas and the Tuscaroras. The sixth nation in theconfederacy, which controlled much of upstate New York before theRevolution, is the Cayuga.   The opinion was written by Circuit Judge Jon O. Newman withjudges Amalya L. Kearse and Ralph K. Winter concurring.</TEXT></DOC>
