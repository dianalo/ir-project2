New regulations, announced by Environmental Protection Agencyadministrator William Reilly, will end the manufacture of mostasbestos products in three phases over the next seven years.   Among the items covered by the ban are automobile and small truckbrake linings, disc brake pads, clutches and automatic transmissioncomponents, with that ban scheduled to begin in 1993 for 1994 models.   The EPA rule does not affect products already in use.   Some auto manufacturers have replaced the asbestos disc brakes inthe front of many vehicles with Kevlar, a synthetic fabric used withresin, or some type of metallic fiber, industry officials said.   They are still in the process of phasing out asbestos in the reardrum brakes.   ``Twenty-five percent of our cars are asbestos free in the rearbrakes and more than half of the trucks,'' said Toni Simonetti, aspokeswoman for General Motors Corp., which introduced asbestos-freefront brakes during the 1970s.   Ben Dunn, engineering and design public relations manager forChrysler, said the company has proceeded cautiously because brakesare one of the most critical systems on a vehicle and consumerexpectations remain high.   Replacing asbestos is difficult because substitute materialscan't be used across the board as manufacturers have been able to dowith asbestos.   ``The bottom line is we're working as fast as we can to getthere,'' Dunn said.   Brake producers have long expected the ban and are graduallyreplacing asbestos with other products, said James Murray, presidentof Nuturn Corp., of Nashville, Tenn. Asbestos is used in only about25 percent of the company's products, he said.   ``If asbestos was banned tomorrow, we would continue to produce aproduct,'' he said. ``It could be converted overnight.''   Ilene Industries of Shelbyville, Tenn., no longer uses asbestosto manufacture brake linings and industrial gaskets, and this weekthe company is removing its remaining stock of asbestos sheetpacking from its storeroom, vice president Ray Smith said.   Whether the switch from asbestos to other materials translatesinto sticker shock for some consumers remains an open question amongindustry officials.   Although he did not have precise figures, Bowditch said he didnot believe the change would mean much steeper prices.   However, Ms. Simonetti, without providing exact figures, said thesubstitute material is ``relatively more expensive.''   Reaction to the ban from other organizations was mixed.   ``I'm pleased to see EPA has taken some action since that law hasbeen in effect since 1976 and little has been done,'' said PeggySeminario, associate director of the occupation safety and healthdepartment of the AFL-CIO.   Seminario expressed the hope that the EPA will strictly regulatethe asbestos substitutes used by manufacturers. ``They may posesignificant hazards as well,'' she said.   Dr. Sidney Wolfe of Public Citizen, consumer activist RalphNader's organization, said the ban is ``too far in the future,''forcing Americans to live with a material that the scientificcommunity has already labeled as dangerous.   Karen Florini, an attorney for the Environmental Defense Fund,said her organization was encouraged by the EPA's action.   ``Finally EPA is preventing asbestos pollution by requiringpeople to switch to less dangerous materials,'' Florini said. ``Bybanning asbestos products, EPA has stopped the entire cycle ofasbestos exposures, from mining to processing and from distributionto disposal.''   But Ellen Silbergeld, a toxicologist with the EnvironmentalDefense Fund, said the ban was long overdue.   ``Asbestos has left a wake of disease and death around the worlddue to piecemeal regulations that have failed to prevent itshazards,'' she said.   The White Lung Association, a group that represents asbestosvictims, said it ``fully supports'' the EPA ban, but said the agencyis not going far enough. The group said the EPA should also requirea recall of asbestos products in use and increase federal funds forasbestos removal from buildings.   Jacqueline Warren, a lawyer for the Natural Resources DefenseCouncil, questioned why the EPA is not requiring a faster phase-inof the ban, especially as it applies to brake parts wheresubstitutes already are available.</TEXT></DOC>
