The Occupational Safety and Health Administration also proposeda $242,000 fine against Cargill over the alleged violations.   Gerard Scannell, OSHA's assistant secretary of labor, said theplant did not implement controls to reduce cumulative traumadisorders in its workers. The disorders, known as CDTs, includecarpal tunnel syndrome and tendonitis.   Greg Lauser, a spokesman at Minneapolis, Minn.,-based Cargill,said the company plans to contest the citations and fine.   ``At this time OSHA has not discussed the detailed factualfindings of its investigation,'' he said, reading from a statement.``Therefore, the company will contest the proposed citation andfine so it can review OSHA's findings.''   CDTs result from constant repetition of awkward or forced handand arm action and result in aching wrists and numb fingers andhands. In some cases, permanent damage can be caused to tendons,nerves and muscles.   OSHA records indicate 90 percent of the Buena Vista plant's 500employees work at tasks that expose them to risk from CDTs.   ``We believe the pervasiveness of CDT in the plant, affectingupwards of an estimated two-thirds of Cargill employees, and thelack of a concerted effort by the company to implement correctiveactions justify the multi-instance penalties,'' Scannell said.   OSHA found 111 CDT violations and cited the plant for not havingan effective program to battle CDTs and for failing to provideemployees' medical records.   Lauser said the company ``has made serious good-faith efforts toaddress CDT problems,'' including hiring medical experts andproviding job rotations.</TEXT></DOC>
