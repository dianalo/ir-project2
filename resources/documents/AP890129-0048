But a Moscow-based Western diplomat said the alliance appeared tohave tailored the categories of forces to support its position thatit is roughly equal in strength with the West.   The breakdown came in a statement by the Warsaw Pact's DefenseMinisters Committee and reported by the Tass news agency.   The statement did not contain numbers of troops and weapons butsaid that when it is published Monday in the Communist Party dailyPravda, the document will be accompanied by ``several tables andexplanations concerning them.''   Monday's editions of Pravda were not immediately available butthe broad outlines contained in the statement differed sharply fromNATO reckonings.   In the statement, the Warsaw Pact said the numerical strengths ofthe two military alliances' ground and air forces ``are roughlyequal.'' But, it added that U.S.-led NATO has twice as many navalpersonnel as its Eastern counterpart.   The statement also said:   _NATO has more frontline or tactical strike aircraft, maritimestrike aircraft, combat helicopters and anti-tank rocket systems.   _The Warsaw Pact has an advantage in tanks, tactical missilelaunchers, interceptor warplanes of air defense forces, combatinfrantry vehicles, armored personnel carriers and artillery.   _NATO ``enjoys a considerable margin of superiority'' in navalwarplanes and large surface ships such as aircraft carriers.   _The Eastern alliance ``has a certain advantage'' in submarinesarmed with missiles and torpedoes.   Both sides are to sit down in Vienna on March 7 to discuss theissues in Negotiations on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe.   The talks were given a boost Dec. 7 when Soviet President MikhailS. Gorbachev announced the Kremlin would reduce the Red Army by a500,000 troops by 1991. Moscow also says it will reduce its weaponsby 10,000 tanks, 8,500 artillery systems and 800 combat planes.   Following Moscow's lead, Romania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia,Hungary, East Germany and Poland have announced cuts in their ownmilitary forces.   NATO officials, citing what they say is Warsaw Pact superiority,have said it would be unwise for the Western alliance to reduce itsarmed forces in response to the Eastern cuts.   NATO contends the Soviets have a 2-to-1 manpower edge and 3-to-1tank advantage. The new Warsaw Pact statement, however, says thatoverall the two sides are close.   ``The military balance in Europe, considering all itsingredients, can be described as a rough parity which does not givea possibility to either side to count on a decisive militaryadvantage,'' the statement said.   It added that there is still a need to reduce forces in Europe``to ensure stability corresponding to the principle of reasonabledefensive sufficiency.''   The Western diplomat contended that broad assertions such asthose in the Warsaw Pact statement are largely meaningless unlessbacked up by specific figures and definitions of what is included ineach category of forces.</TEXT></DOC>
