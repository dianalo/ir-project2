In the letter included in the company's annual report, Price Waterhouse noted that the company's reorganization plan is contingent upon certain issues being resolved, including a dispute between the company and the Internal Revenue Service. As previously reported, Storage Technology is operating under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code while it tries to work out a plan to pay its debts.    Late last year, a federal bankruptcy judge tentatively approved Storage Technology's reorganization plan, contingent upon the company receiving financing commitments, settling class-action lawsuits, reducing the unsecured claims against it to $738 million and settling the IRS dispute for $55 million or less.    The company also must receive final confirmation of the reorganization plan by June 30.    A spokesman for the maker of data-storage devices said the company has agreed on a settlement for the class-action lawsuits, received a new credit line and reduced its unsecured claims. The IRS is appealing, however, a bankruptcy judge's ruling that Storage Technology owes only $22.8 million to the IRS. The IRS has argued that the company owes as much as $640 million in back taxes, penalties and interest.    The spokesman said the company still is trying to negotiate a settlement with the IRS. Previously, the company had said it hoped to settle the IRS dispute by the end of the first quarter. </TEXT></DOC>
