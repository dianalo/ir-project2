The cutbacks are fueling efforts by two unions to organizemore Ford white-collar employees. About 550 employees at twosites near the company's Dearborn, Mich., headquarters willvote shortly on whether to join a union.</LP><TEXT>   Ford's work force reductions this year are just thebeginning of a prolonged cost-cutting effort, said AlexanderTrotman, a Ford executive vice president and head of itsNorth American auto operations. Ford needs to cut salariedcosts in its core North American auto business about 20% inthe next five years, not just to weather the currentrecession but to compete with leaner Japanese auto makers, hesaid. Ford will not only reduce its payrolls but also cutspending on functions, such as data-processing andengineering, now performed by outside firms, he said.   &quot;Relative to the very best {auto makers}, we still havesome fat, particularly in our salaried cost structure,&quot; Mr.Trotman told reporters Friday after presenting a qualityaward to the company's Wixom assembly plant. Although Ford'smanufacturing costs are believed to be close to those ofJapanese auto makers, the No. 2 U.S. car manufacturer stillspends far more to bring new products to market than itsJapanese counterparts.   &quot;We need to get a dollar's worth of product for 80 cents,&quot;Mr. Trotman said. Mr. Trotman's axe has already been swung inthe company's body and assembly operations, where Ford hasdismissed 250 salaried workers in the past two months andreturned 80 white-collar workers to the hourly ranks. Thecompany last month offered early retirement packages towhite-collar workers, and Mr. Trotman said 900 to 1,000accepted them.   Analysts praised Ford's cost-cutting moves but said thereal test will come when the market improves. &quot;The greatesttemptation management will face is to add heads when businessimproves,&quot; said analyst John Casesa of Wertheim Schroder andamp;Co.   Ford said in 1985 that it would reduce its white-collarranks 20% by 1990, but in fact, the number of salariedworkers had fallen less than 4% by that time. Some Fordwhite-collar workers are serving notice that they'll resistthe latest round of cutbacks, too.   On Wednesday, 243 people who work at a Ford engine testingfacility will vote on whether to join the Society ofEngineering Office Workers. An additional 308 Ford designstaff employees are to vote May 8 on whether to berepresented by a union and whether that union will be theEngineering Office Workers or the United Auto Workers.   &quot;There's no doubt there's some comparison shopping goingon,&quot; said Paul Nantais, president of the Engineering OfficeWorkers. Mr. Nantais said both organizing drives have pickedup steam over the past two months as Ford has announced aseries of cost-cutting measures aimed at white-collarworkers. &quot;It seems to be an ideal environment fororganizing,&quot; Mr. Nantais said.   Currently, only 1,000 of Ford's 52,000 North Americanwhite-collar employees are represented by unions. But unionofficials say Ford white-collar workers want the protectionfrom layoffs and income losses that blue-collar workersrepresented by the UAW have. In addition to sweepingjob-security and income-security benefits, Ford'sUAW-represented workers have maintained their cost-of-livingincreases and their health benefits.   By contrast, Ford cut merit pay of its white-collarworkers 25% this year, effective last Monday. The auto makeralso has cut medical benefits in previous years by requiringemployees to pay more of their medical expenses, and it haseliminated cost-of-living benefits for most of these workers.   A Ford spokesman said company officials oppose the uniondrives. During bad economic times when workers are asked tomake sacrifices, he said, &quot;There will always be those whowant to use the opportunity to talk union.&quot; He said Fordofficials believe they can satisfy the concerns of theirwhite-collar employees without involving a union.</TEXT></DOC>
