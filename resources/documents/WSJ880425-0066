The Midland, Texas-based limited partnership led by oilmen Jack E. Brown and Cyril Wagner Jr. has been seeking control of USG since last year, when it disclosed it held a 9.8% stake in the Chicago-based building products concern. The $1.64 billion offer, which USG says is inadequate, had been set to expire last Friday.    The partnership said it extended the offer so it could seek an accord with USG on a vote about redeeming, or ending, the company's &quot;poison pill&quot; anti-takeover plan. But by late Friday, USG and Desert Partners each had charged that the other had rejected its proposal for the vote.    Last week, USG, in an apparent bid to buy time, offered to submit the poison pill issue to a vote of its holders June 6 if Desert Partners would extend its tender offer to June 16. It proposed that if 85% of the shares outstanding, excluding those held by USG officers, vote to redeem the rights provided for in the plan, the USG board would comply by June 16.    Desert Partners countered that a majority vote should be sufficient. It also sought assurances that USG wouldn't undertake some other defensive move.    USG last month gave its holders rights to buy a new series of preferred shares in accordance with a 1986 plan aimed at making a takeover prohibitively expensive. Under the plan, the rights take effect if a tender offer is made for at least 30% of USG's common or if an individual, company or group acquires 20% or more.    Desert Partners' offer for 39 million shares covers about 76% of those outstanding. Desert Partners said that as of Thursday, 12.4 million shares had been tendered.    In composite trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, USG's common closed at $38 a share, up 25 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
