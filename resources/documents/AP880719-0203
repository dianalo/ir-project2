The exchange came in a session of the twice-weekly QuestionTime, where the prime minister fields questions and often insultsfrom legislators. Mrs. Thatcher said sanctions would devastate theeconomies of the countries near South Africa.   Those countries _ Angola, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Botswana andZambia _ are dependent on South Africa to transport their goods andhave not imposed economic restrictions themselves, she said.   Replying to a question from opposition leader Neil Kinnock, Mrs.Thatcher said Britain already has invested $84 million in foreignaid to the surrounding states and has further plans to reduce theirdependence on South Africa.   Kinnock, leader of the Labor Party, said his visit to southernAfrica last week showed him that ``strong sanctions'' were neededto end South Africa's system of apartheid.   Under apartheid, South Africa's 26 million blacks cannot vote onnational affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy andmaintain separate districts, schools and health services.   Kinnock did not visit South Africa.   ``The leaders of the front-line states call for sanctions,''Kinnock told Mrs. Thatcher amid cheers from his party and jeersfrom her governing Conservatives.   ``Do you really think you know more about what needs to be donethan those who live daily with apartheid and its oppression? Thisis not only a question of sense but a question of morality,''Kinnock said.   As rank-and-file Labor legislators shouted ``racist!'' and``Nazi!'' at Mrs. Thatcher and the Conservatives, she replied:   ``I totally disagree with you about sanctions, and unlike youI'm not prepared to stand here comfortably in this house and imposestarvation on millions and millions of black South Africans andblack children.''   South Africa's ambassador to Britain meanwhile defended theimprisonment of Nelson Mandela, leader of the African NationalCongress, who turned 70 on Monday.   Speaking to a meeting of the Diplomatic and CommonwealthWriters' Association in London, Ambassador Rae Killen said Mandelacould be released if he renounced violence. Mandela says SouthAfrica must first renounce apartheid.   He has been imprisoned since 1962, first for inciting unrest andlater for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the government.</TEXT></DOC>
