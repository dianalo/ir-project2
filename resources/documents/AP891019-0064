Legislators voted to banish parties from the shop and factoryfloor despite opposition from the ruling Socialist Party.   At a congress last week that dissolved the Communist Party andreplaced it with the Socialist Party that embraced democracy,delegates overwhelmingly approved a motion calling for the right toorganize party cells in the workplace.   Under authoritarian Communist rule, such organizing has allowedthe ruling party to maintain political control over industry. Itwas thus vigorously opposed by newly created opposition groups thatare preparing for Hungary's first free national elections since theCommunists consolidated power in 1948.   The law passed today also seeks to define what the SocialistParty owns by drawing the line between legally acquired funds andproperty and other assets its Marxist-Leninist predecessor merelycontrol or may have seized illegally.   The political opposition claims much of the party's wealth wasseized illegally after 1948.   Under Communist rule, the party had controlled the government.   At least in theory, the new law opens the way for people whocontend the government stole their property to seek its return.   The Socialist Party, which claims to embrace democratic idealsbut remains in power at least until the national elections, agreedWednesday to discuss the disposal of some of its wealth withParliament and the government.   Constitutional amendments laying down the right of politicalparties ``to be freely established and ... (to) freely function''were approved Wednesday.   But the party law passed during a nationally televised sessiontoday is more specific, formally outlining those rights as thecountry prepares for next year's multiparty elections.   Legislators approved some sections of the party law separately,with 279 voting for a ban on parties at the workplace, 44 against,and 12 abstaining.   The section specifying Socialist Party assets was approved by259 parliamentarians, with 44 against and 27 abstentions.   Some present did not vote, accounting for the different totals.   The bill is specifically geared to political parties wishing tofield candidates in the upcoming elections. It specifies, forexample, that no party may accept contributions from a foreignstate.   Among other legislation enacted today was a law creating aSupreme Court.   On Wednesday, Parliament established the office of president ofthe republic, who will replace the 21-man collective presidency.But the parliament sidestepped a controversy over when and how thepresident would be elected.   The current arrangement calls for the president to be chosen ina direct election for which Nov. 26 is the tentative date.   Opposition forces are calling for a delay until after theparliamentary elections that are to be held by June, and want thenew Parliament, where the opposition hopes for an overall majority,to choose the president.   The opposition fears the ruling party would be at an advantageif the elections are held next month, that it will not have enoughtime to organize an effective campaign.   Parliament has not acted on a petition calling for a referendumon when to hold the election.</TEXT></DOC>
