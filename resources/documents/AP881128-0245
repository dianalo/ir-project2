Every place, when we arrive, I say,`We're home,''' said the 48-year-old music director of theCincinnati Symphony.   Lopez-Cobos also is general music director of the Berlin Operaand music director of the Spanish National Orchestra. He recentlywas appointed music director of the Lausanne Chamber Orchestra inSwitzerland, effective in the fall of 1990, the year his contractends in Berlin.   This season he conducts more than three months in Cincinnati. InBerlin, he'll conduct nine operas, including Wagner's ``Ring''cycle, which he will bring to the Kennedy Center of the PerformingArts in June.   ``Seventeen years in Berlin I think is enough,'' Lopez-Cobossaid. ``The repertory system is very, very hard work. You have toswitch from one opera to the next. You can not go only to do a newproduction and then disappear. I have to conduct everything.   ``I knew before I accepted Cincinnati that in '90 I would finishBerlin. I knew the first three years would be difficult, then Iwould have more time. I have decided that's my last opera house torun. It is not like before when singers stayed. They want to guesteverywhere. We have terrible problems to make the repertory,'' hesaid.   ``For a European conductor, it is so pleasant to be with onenormal American orchestra. I couldn't say no.''   Lopez-Cobos has a doctorate in philosophy from the University ofMadrid. The subject has helped his conducting, he says. ``Everycomposer is a child of his time, of the mentality of his time. Mostof them had relationships with philosophers. I think it is good ifyou have an idea of what was happening at the time of a composer'slife.   ``I think specializing is a very bad thing. I hear, `He is a verygood Mozart conductor.' I think, `He is already limited.' The moreyou know about differences between composers and their orchestralcolors, the more you can use it in your work for other things.''   Lopez-Cobos, whose second wife died of cancer more than two yearsago, is married to Cuba-born, America-educated lawyer Alicia Ferrer,whom he met in Switzerland. He has two sons, Jesus, 19, and Manuel,8, who live with relatives in Madrid.   The conductor was born in Toro, Spain, in February 1940, during atime of celebration at the end of the Spanish Civil War. His parentsnamed him Jesus, he says, ``because they thought I was a gift ofheaven. And Jesus is a very common name in Spain.   ``I took a long time to decide between philosophy and music. Myfather was in the Wagner Society when he was in Madrid as a youngman. He was interested in German culture, philosophy and music. Iheard music at home.   ``As a student in Spain I conducted chorales. I was alwaysinterested in singing and the 16th and 17th century music of Spain.''   After getting his degree he went to Vienna to study conducting.``I'm a little bit fatalistic. There were two well-known conductingcompetitions, in Copenhagen and Besancon, France.''   He entered, won third prize in Copenhagen in 1968 and first inFrance in 1969. ``This encouraged me to try (to become a conductor).We know the chances in Spain are almost zero. I knew I have to tryoutside Spain, which is always more difficult than in your owncountry,'' he said.   The first orchestra he conducted was the Youth PraguePhilharmonic. Then, after spending the 1969-70 year at the JuilliardSchool, Lopez-Cobos went to Italy.   ``I knew Peter Maag, a Swiss conductor. I assisted him in someoperas. In Venice he got sick and I had to conduct for him,'' hesaid. It was ``The Magic Flute,'' his opera-conducting debut, in1970. Lopez-Cobos was 30.   ``That was my chance,'' he said. ``I stayed almost a year inVenice, until I came to Berlin. In 1971, Lorin Maazel resigned fromthe Berlin Opera to take the Cleveland Orchestra. They decided totake three or four young conductors instead of a music director. Iwas invited for three performances. At the break (intermission) inthe first, they offered me a four-year contract. I was unsure. Myfriends in Vienna said, `Go.''' He has been music director since1981.   His U.S. conducting debut was in 1972 in a performance of ``Luciadi Lammermoor,'' starring Beverly Sills at the San Francisco Opera.   In 1986, Lopez-Cobos followed Michael Gielen, who moved to theBaden-Baden Radio Symphony in Germany, as music director of theCincinnati Symphony.   Lopez-Cobos also has a recording project with Telarc Records.   ``My Cincinnati contract is to 1991,'' he said. ``Probably I willcome with my family to America, find a house and from here go toEurope.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Weekend Editions, Dec 9-11</NOTE></DOC>
