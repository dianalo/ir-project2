Rafsanjani said there were ``prudent solutions'' to the hostagesituation and offered to help find them. While Bush voiced guardedoptimism, his chief spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said, ``We arealways skeptical of what we hear'' from Iran.   Fitzwater said that while no efforts had been made by thepresident or other top U.S. officials to deal with Iranianofficials directly, information was being exchanged with thatcountry's leaders on the situation through third-countryintermediaries.   Meanwhile, the president and his aides sought to play down talkof a possible military strike against targets in Lebanon if anotherU.S. hostage were killed.   ``If I had made such a decision, I expect this would be the lastplace I'd be talking about it,'' Bush said, speaking with reportersduring a picture-taking session in the Oval Office.   Fitzwater, meanwhile, denied that Bush had selected specifictargets in Lebanon for an air strike if kidnappers had carried outa threat to kill American hostage Joseph Cicippio.   ``I will say he did not make final decisions,'' Fitzwater said,referring to a story in Friday's New York Times that Bush wasprepared to order the Sixth Fleet to launch air strikes againstsuspected terrorist strongholds, including a base in easternLebanon.   ``It does not help the United States government or the UnitedStates to be discussing military tactics ... to be flexing ourmuscles in public,'' Fitzwater said. ``We do not believe it's inthe best interests of releasing the hostages.''   A day after Cicippio's captors said they had spared him, atleast for the present, Bush said he was ``certainly pleased thatthat brutal murder that had been threatened had been set aside.''   On Rafsanjani's offer to help, Bush said: ``When you see astatement that offers hope for the return of our hostages, I wantto explore it to the fullest.'' Iran is thought to have stronginfluence over Shiite Moslem militants holding Americans captive.   Bush continued: ``I'm encouraged. But I don't want to get thehopes of the hostages' loved ones up once again, to have thosehopes dashed. This is a brutal process, where you see peopleparaded before cameras and their families get their hopes up.''   Bush called the head of the Geneva-based International RedCross, Cornelio Sommaruga, to voice support for that humanitarianagency's efforts to win freedom for the hostages, according toFitzwater.   ``He (Bush) wanted him to know we appreciated their efforts. Wehope they're successful,'' said Fitzwater. ``The United States iswilling to be of any help we can.''   Efforts by the Red Cross were alluded to in Rafsanjani'sstatement, Fitzwater noted.   He said the United States would stand firmly behind its vow notto negotiate for the release of hostages. ``We have our policy andthat's what we follow,'' he said.   Rafsanjani made his comments during a prayer sermon at TehranUniversity, broadcast on Tehran radio. While warning against U.S.``bullyings, arrogant speeches and tyranny,'' Rafsanjani said:``Come, let us approach the problem reasonably.''   ``I tell the White House, the problem of Lebanon has solutions;the freeing of the hostages has solutions, reasonable, prudentsolutions.''   However, Rafsanjani's offer appeared conditional. He urged theUnited States to take the initiative by pressuring Israel torelease the Shiite Moslem cleric it abducted a week ago, SheikAbdul Karim Obeid.   The kidnapping triggered the apparent execution of Lt. Col.William R. Higgins and the death threat against Cicippio.   Although officials have said the United States would not seek todictate hostage policy to Israel, Bush on Friday reiterated anappeal he first made Monday night for all countries holdinghostages to release them.   ``I would just appeal to the civilized world or any countryanywhere in the world to lay aside this holding of people againsttheir will _ hostages _ and do what is right and decent andhonorable in terms of the release of those hostages that are stillheld,'' the president said.   Bush, who White House aides said had called more than a dozenworld leaders over the past few days in an effort to bring pressureon the kidnappers, cited a ``very extraordinarily broad exercise ofdiplomacy here in the last couple of days.''   Fitzwater later said diplomatic contacts were continuing.``There are still a lot of people talking to a lot of people in theregion about how to get the hostages out,'' he said.   He also said that ``we've had high level and continuing talkswith Israel,'' even though the president himself hasn't talkeddirectly with Israeli leaders.   Bush was asked if Cicippio deserved the full backing of theUnited States, in view of the fact that he ignored U.S. warnings toleave Lebanon.   ``That doesn't mean we wash our hands of it,'' Bush said. ``He'san American and he is entitled to the concern of the president, andevery one of these senators and everybody in our administration.And he's got a great, big, wonderful family up there that areeating their hearts out in Norristown, Pa.''   Bush said he had not talked with members of the Cicippio familybut ``the State Department has been in daily contact with them _daily.''</TEXT></DOC>
