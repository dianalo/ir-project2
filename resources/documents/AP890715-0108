The summit leaders have already made the environment acornerstone of their 15th annual economic summit. They addressed theissue in passing in the political communique issued earlier Saturday.   ``We see good opportunities for the countries of West and East towork together ... to safeguard the resources and the environment,''the leaders declared.   One-third of the final communique was expected to cover theenvironment, a reflection of the growing sentiment around the worldfor a solution to the world's pollution problems.   During their discussions Saturday, British Prime MinisterMargaret Thatcher told her colleagues: ``No generation has afreehold on this earth. All we have is a life tenancy with a fullrepairing lease.''   A British spokesman, who relayed Mrs. Thatcher's comments, saidthere was general consensus among the summit partners thatenvironmental problems should be attacked through existinginternational institutions, including the U.N. EnvironmentalProgram, the World Meteorological Organization and other U.N.agencies on climate changes.   A Canadian official said West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl was``particularly firm'' in insisting that tropical rain forests begiven urgent attention.   The official, who briefed reporters on condition he not beidentified, said Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said thecommunique should express the need for a barometer or yardstick tomeasure the environment costs caused by economic development.   According to the British spokesman, who also requested anonymity,Mrs. Thatcher said ``the guiding philosophy should be recognition ofthe principle that environmentally senstive development is bothpossible and essential.''   The Bush administration views the environment as an area in whichthe United States can provide the leadership.   ``This is the 15th summit of the leaders of the seven countrieshere,'' said William Reilly, administrator of the U.S. EnvironmentalProtection Agency. ``None has ever come close to paying theattention to the environment that this one has.''   Among the items on the table: air and water pollution, includingacid rain, oil spills and damage to the ozone layer fromchloroflurocarbons in the upper atmosphere, a problem that Reillysaid could lead to the ``potential destablilization of the planet.''   ``On all of these issues, we see that there is an emergingconsensus on the part of the leaders of the governments representedhere ... that these issues are significant, important, are worthy ofconcern at the very highest levels of government,'' Reilly said.   But he said no formal agreement on a course of action wasexpected when the final summit communique is released Sunday.   ``It's not the function ... of governments to come together atsummits and set out specific measures to reduce, for example, theunemployment rate or the rate of inflation,'' he said.   ``Rather, the point of summit conversations is to identifyproblems, determine general categories of priority, give a degree ofconsensus, if that exists, identifying, sometimes, areas ofdisagreement that have to be resolved,'' said Reilly. ``That iswhat's happening on the environment.''   The final communique is likely to express little beyond a unifiedcall among the industrial powers for decisive action by all nationsas well as a reiteration of concern about depletion of the ozonelayer, ocean pollution, dirty urban air and the need for a``framework'' agreement that may eventually lead to a multinationaltreaty on global warming.   That isn't enough for environmentalists.   ``Diplomacy is great, but it's got to run according to theatmosphere's timetable, not political leaders','' Pomerance toldreporters.   ``We wish that the United States would come with a proposal tomake a 20 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by the endof this century,'' said David Gardner, legislative director of theSierra Club.   Gardner said it appeared that neither Bush nor Reilly had``brought such a proposal to this summit. And that's a majordisappointment to us.''   Kohl was pushing a proposal to convert Third World debt into afund for protection of endangered tropical rain forests. But thatidea has generated a lukewarm response from the United States andGreat Britain and appeared to have little chance for success.   Japan, in a statement of its ``major contributions'' to thesummit, outlined its plan to give developing countries $2.25 billionover three years for projects to improve the environment. It said itwill send a mission to Eastern Europe to determine how to attack theproblems on a global level.</TEXT></DOC>
