The homers gave the A's a lift at atime when the sight of pitcher Dave Stewart's early departure could have leftthem unsettled.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  LONG SHOTS LIFT A'SMCGWIRE BELTS 2 TOWERING HRS  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     McGwire sends them out -- with hugs and kisses -- to all the rotisserieleague nerds who were dying with every &quot;4 0 0 0&quot; that he was inserting intothe daily box scores. You know who you are.;    &quot;It's hard to flush things outof your mind with all these stats and these games the businessmen play,&quot; hesaid. &quot;People keep talking and harping.;    &quot;It's ridiculous. It gets to thepoint where . . . stop talking about it. Just let people play. Stats aretaking over the game.&quot;;    What needed flushing was a 41-game homer droughtthat ended Sunday but had bothered McGwire the more he tried to forget aboutit.;    &quot;When people are constantly writing about it or talking about it, youcan't help but think about it,&quot; he said. &quot;If people threw the stats away . ..&quot;;    Without those stats, we might not fully appreciate the past four gamesand just how out of sync they have been with your typical nine innings at theColiseum.;    The Coliseum's expansive foul territory and deep fences normallyconjures warm, fuzzy images for pitchers who watch the long flyballs hit offthem caught on the warning track. These same pitchers now are likely to wakeup screaming about a place with winds from hell, a ballpark that has lost allrestraint and given up 73 runs in its past four games.;    When asked recentlyif anything good came from the A's 20-6 and 15-6 losses to Cleveland lastweekend, Manager Tony La Russa said, yes, three players hit their first homeruns of the season.;    The trio -- McGwire, Baines and Rickey Henderson --hit nine of the 17 home runs hit in the Coliseum over the past four games.;   &quot;Anything that makes you more natural just gives you a better chance,&quot; said LaRussa. &quot;You start pressing -- no matter what it is -- and it makes youunnatural.&quot;;    Both of McGwire's homers were on first pitches, from MikeFlanagan in the first inning and Mark Williamson in the A's sixth-run fifth.But he attributed his good fortune to his staying power more than hisaggressiveness.;    &quot;You just keep on rolling,&quot; he said. &quot;You don't doanything special. I mean, it's a long haul. I give myself 650 at-bats and seewhat happens.;    &quot;It's just one of those days, one of the few where my batmet the ball squarely.&quot;;    Curt Young's second-inning rescue of Stewart wasovershadowed by McGwire's long balls and Stewart's short stay. But it was noless noteworthy.;    The left-hander warmed up quickly after Stewart's rare,injury-induced exit and went the next 3 2/3 innings without giving up a run.;   &quot;It's heartbreaking; Stew was trying to get a win, trying to get somethinggoing, and that happens,&quot; La Russa said. &quot;Mother Nature spoke up.;    &quot;But wehad the perfect guy.&quot;;    The A's seem to always have one hanging around, justwaiting his turn.;  HOW THEY SCORED;    A's 1st -- R.Henderson doubled.D.Henderson singled, moving R.Henderson to third.
