SimpsonStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 07/02/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> GM F IBM </IN><TEXT>   When Congress approved the Metric Conversion Act in 1975, its proponents predicted that within a decade Americans would be griping about the heat in Celsius, traveling in kilometers and ordering steaks in grams.    Well, the prediction was off target -- by many miles. Conversion to the metric system has quietly fizzled out to become one of the major non-happenings in American history.    Oh, the system has made some headway, notably among businesses whose overseas markets are almost all geared to the system, too. But in matters touching on the average American's daily life, the effect has been slight.    The National Weather Service has decided not to report rainfall in centimeters and winds in meters per second -- not yet, anyway -- although it still does report Fahrenheit and Celsius (formerly centigrade) temperatures. Everything else, says a service meteorologist, is &quot;on hold.&quot;    Service-station owners who started pumping gas entirely by liters have switched back to gallons. Shell Oil Co. had refitted pumps in about 16,000 stations across the country at an estimated cost of between $1.5 million and $2 million. Shell abandoned the effort after just two years when consumers, confused by the new terminology, started filling up at competing stations that still sold by the gallon.    And at Harper andamp; Row Publishers Inc., where copy chief Dolores Simon was among the believers, the status quo in cookbooks has been restored. Ms. Simon had suggested using metric quantities in recipes. Authors and editors balked, but they compromised with measurement conversion tables at the back of each book. Now Harper andamp; Row has dropped the tables. &quot;We really tried,&quot; Ms. Simon says with a sigh, &quot;but everybody just forgot about metric.&quot;    Thomas M. Stabler, an executive with Toledo Scale Corp., agrees with this assessment. &quot;People in this country couldn't care less about metric,&quot; he says. Mr. Stabler once made regular presentations on the metric system to schools, service clubs and chambers of commerce. &quot;But after a year and a half, I didn't get any requests,&quot; he says. &quot;Since then, not one. I think that tells us metric is really a dead subject.&quot;    Albert M. Navas, the president of the National Metric Council, an industry-supported advocacy group, says it is too soon for obituaries, but he concedes that the metric system in the U.S. &quot;hasn't been as successful as the people back in 1975 meant it to be.&quot;    Even then, the country was ambivalent. Congress approved the conversion, but it failed to set a formal deadline for it. In fact, the transition wasn't required at all. Instead, the law called for &quot;voluntary conversion.&quot; Making it optional, says G.T. Underwood, who currently heads the Commerce Department's Office of Metric Programs, allowed people to &quot;choose the easiest way, and in this case that meant ignoring the issue.&quot;    Efforts were undermined further by squabbling among the 17 members on the board that Congress created to oversee the transition. Some members were downright hostile. &quot;I don't like 200 million people being misled and being forced to convert to the metric system by propaganda,&quot; declares Thomas Harrigan, an official of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, who served on the board for two years. Mr. Harrigan boasts that he sabotaged the board's efforts to &quot;impose&quot; the metric system on the public.    Accordingly, the U.S. now is one of just two countries in the world -- the other is Burma -- that haven't either adopted the metric system or required its future adoption. That doesn't bother Mr. Harrigan. Comparing other countries with the U.S., he says, is &quot;like comparing ants and elephants; you could argue forever about which is the better system, but we've got a system and it's the base of a $2 trillion economy.&quot;    Americans have been resisting the metric system ever since the French Academy of Sciences introduced it in 1790. Although Thomas Jefferson and other American intellectuals admired it, other Founding Fathers argued that the fledgling nation should stick with the pounds and inches of Great Britain, America's principal trading partner.    The country's major trading partners have changed over the years. So have the measurement systems they use. Even Great Britain has officially gone metric. But most Americans are just as loyal to the old system as their ancestors were.    National Geographic magazine has been using metric measurements in its scientific articles and maps for nearly a decade now, but readers still write in to complain. Some call the magazine's editors &quot;unAmerican,&quot; &quot;traitors&quot; and &quot;pinko Commies&quot; for using the metric system. This is &quot;a real volatile issue in mainstream America,&quot; says Joseph Blanton, who handles the magazine's mail. He says the only subject that draws more letters is evolution.    The Federal Highway Administration ran into a similar hue and cry when it put up road signs with speed limits posted in both miles and kilometers. So many irate drivers complained to their legislators that Congress included a provision in the 1978 Highway Act prohibiting the use of federal funds for metrication.    &quot;The signal we got here,&quot; says James Weaver, an engineer with the highway agency, &quot;was don't even think about metric, don't spend any time on it, and most of all don't spend any money on it.&quot; Mr. Navas at the National Metric Council says the 1978 highway law was &quot;a real defeat&quot; for the metric movement.    Still, metrication has made strides, and not only in industry. Swimming and track events are recorded in meters now: Sprinters who used to run the 100-yard dash now run the 100 meters.    The measurement system has also gained a strong toehold in the classroom. The problem, says John A. Dossey, the president of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, is that while youngsters learn the metric system in school, they don't get many opportunities to use it outside. &quot;Teachers feel a little betrayed,&quot; he says, &quot;in having worked hard to upgrade themselves and changing curriculums and then having government back off.&quot;    But it is in the business world that metrication has fared best. General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and International Business Machines Corp. now design and manufacture their products to metric specifications alone. Companies that sell soft drinks and hard liquor bottle their beverages only in metric-sized containers. (Beer makers still use ounces but also specify the metric equivalent.) According to the metric council, about 70% of the Fortune 500 companies currently use the metric system in some aspect of their business.    General Motors made the decision to go metric in 1973. &quot;The prime factor was the recognition that we were in an international business and that much of the world was working in metric,&quot; explains H. William Ellison, the director of engineering standards.    Advocates of the metric system say increased concern about international competition has given their cause a much needed boost. &quot;The giants have done it, but we're a nation of small businesses and there are an awful lot of small businesses that are export-sensitive,&quot; says an aide to Sen. Claiborne Pell, Democrat of Rhode Island. The senator, a long-time metric man, has co-sponsored a bill to encourage greater use of the metric system in government agencies.    The Defense Department is on the verge of being won over. For the sake of greater compatibility with NATO equipment, it is moving toward requiring all major U.S. weapons systems to be built to metric specifications.    But even the most devoted partisans of the metric system concede that it will take a long time to win the hearts and minds of average Americans. &quot;I don't think in the next 100 years, you'll see football fields and baseball diamonds converted to metric,&quot; says Mr. Navas. &quot;That dog won't hunt in our society. Not in your lifetime, my lifetime, or even our kids'.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
