Ninety percent of them are blacks, barred by apartheid fromadvancing any farther in an industry that drives South Africa'seconomy.   In this mine, 3,600 feet below the corn, there was no breeze tocool the sweaty brow this day. The only sound as the day shiftstarted its work was that of the men, carrying drills, picks andshovels, as they trudged in heavy boots through the mud toward aband of dark quartzite that signifies a gold-bearing reef.   The men had stripped down to short pants to work in the90-degree heat of the mine, hanging their outer pants, jackets andshirts on pegs or beams along the walls of the tunnel.   The danger was there, as it always is, when their drills startedscreaming into the rock and the men hacked with picks and shoveledthe rubble aside, preparing holes for the explosives that wouldblow the ore loose.   About 800 miners a year die on the job in South Africa, fromrockbursts caused by underground pressure, tunnel collapses,poisonous fumes, fire and other accidents.   This part of the work _ digging out the ore _ is for theunskilled and semi-skilled, for the blacks, who put in the thelongest hours for the lowest pay.   They operate the drills, the ore carriers, the air hoses andpulleys, but the highest position they can hold is that of teamleader, which pays up to 1200 rand ($600) a month for directingoperations at the rock face. That's still 200 rand ($100) less thanthe lowest-paid whites in the mines.   The blacks are prevented by law from handling explosives, a jobthat would qualify them for the supervisory positions leading tomanagement.   Western Holdings Mine, owned by the Anglo American Corp., hasabout 18,000 employees, with 28.5 percent from nearby Lesotho, theenclave kingdom within South Africa; 25.6 percent from Transkei, aSouth African black homeland; and 29 percent, including 9 percentwhites, from South Africa's four provinces.   As the men worked this day, sweat streamed down their faces fromunder the plastic safety helmets worn by the 13 black team membersand their white supervisor. The screaming water drill sprayed tinygranules of rock back into their faces and bare chests. Thedrilling bore the holes for the placement of explosives to blastthe ore loose, then came the shrill whistle of the air hose used toclear the holes.   The noise was deafening.   Anglo American company is negotiating with the National Union ofMineworkers, which represents 60 percent of black employees in itsmines, to require miners to wear ear muffs because the noise of thedrills and blasting eventually affects hearing.   ``There is a tradition of deafness being something to be proudof, indicating long service, but we just can't accept that,'' saidAndrew Robb, section manager of No. 5 shaft.   This shaft, one of six on Western Holdings Mine, produces 70,000tons of ore a month, from which about 17,600 ounces of gold isextracted. It is one of seven adjacent mines that together producedabout 4 million ounces of gold in 1987 for Anglo American, thecountry's largest mining company.   The average black miner, prohibited by law from advancing up theranks to supervisory work, earns 650 rand ($325) in cash a month _five times less than the average white mineworker _ plus room andboard at Anglo American mines.   The company has threatened to take South Africa's apartheidgovernment to court over the law, which is being rewritten. Anglois also quietly defying government restrictions on where itsemployees can live, allowing some single black men, such asengineers, to live in housing designated for whites.   According to 1950s projections, Western Holdings Mine shouldhave been abandoned by now, but the current price of gold, hoveringaround $450 an ounce, makes mining low-grade sections feasible.   After the men at the rock face finish their day shift, a newcrew takes over to collect the gold ore and the day shift rides theelevators back to the surface.   The whites go home; the blacks go to hostels where they arerequired by law to live.   Anglo American is trying to combat the law, which requires blackminers to live in segregated, single-sex hostels on mine property,while their families must remain in far-off rural tribal homelandsor even in other countries.   The law does not apply to the foreign whites, many of them fromScotland and Wales.   In addition to Lesotho, black miners at Western Holdings comefrom nearby Mozambique, Botswana, Swaziland and Malawi.   Anglo American is subsidizing apartments and houses in the blacktownship of Thabong for many of its black employees who want tolive with their families and can afford it. Many are single, andmany others do not want to give up their rural homes, or areforeigners whose families cannot come to South Africa.   A few thousand probably will get to move into the homes inThabong when they are completed. The rest will remain in thehostels, sending money to their families and visiting them once ortwice a year.   At the hostel for the No. 5 shaft, 5,146 black men live in asetting with the combined atmosphere of a prison, a collegedormitory and an English boarding school.   Eight to 16 men sleep on bunk beds in each room.   The men take their meals in a central kitchen for each of the 10dormitory blocks, which are mixed tribally. The complex includes asports field, a technical training center and a bar.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, April 17</NOTE></DOC>
