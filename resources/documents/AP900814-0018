About 20 people from surrounding homes were evacuated after thedevice was found Monday attached to a garden-hose reel behind thehouse of Sir Anthony Farrar-Hockley in Moulsford, 30 miles west ofLondon.   ``I can confirm that it definitely was an explosive device. Ithas been made safe,'' said Chief Constable Colin Smith of ThamesValley Police.   The Irish Republican Army, which has killed two people in anintensified bombing campaign in England this year, was suspected,police said. There was no claim of responsiblity.   It was the third consecutive Monday in which there was a bombingincident in southern England.   The first killed Ian Gow, a member of Parliament and closefriend of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, at his home in Hankham,65 miles southeast of London.   The second fell off a car at a home in London once owned by aBritish government official but now occupied by an American. Thedevice did not explode.   Farrar-Hockley took command of British Forces in 1970, the yearafter they were sent to Northern Ireland to separate warringProtestants and Roman Catholics. He left Northern Ireland in 1971,and retired in 1983.   The IRA has attacked military offices, London's Stock Exchangeand a club associated with the governing Conservative Party thisyear in its campaign to undermine British rule in Northern Ireland.   The IRA, which is outlawed in Britain and Ireland, says it seeksto unite the Protestant-dominated province with the Republic ofIreland, which is 95 percent Catholic.</TEXT></DOC>
