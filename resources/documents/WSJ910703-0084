Executives, directors and major shareholders at companiesthat count on the consumer dollar have been trimming theirstockholdings, not by huge percentages but in amounts sizableenough to eclipse insider selling in all other industries,filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission show.Moreover, the selling is across the board, at departmentstores, apparel chains, shoe stores, discount stores andluxury and specialty retailers.</LP><TEXT>   Some analysts and economists attribute the above-averageselling to the disparity between Wall Street perception andMain Street reality.   &quot;Retailers are looking at their business and saying, `Mystock is getting ahead of itself,'&quot; says Charles Lieberman,managing director and economist of Manufacturers HanoverSecurities Corp. &quot;What's interesting is that they're takingmoney off the table at a time when things are supposed to begetting a lot better.&quot;   When insider selling in the retail industry took off inthe second quarter, retailing stocks were trading at pricesthat &quot;were anticipating recovery&quot; says Jeff Edelman, analystat C.J. Lawrence Inc. &quot;Wall Street was looking six monthsout,&quot; while &quot;retailers were looking back at last week.&quot; Now,says Mr. Edelman, retailers are &quot;past the low point,&quot; but therecovery will be &quot;slow, and no one is jumping up and downabout it.&quot;   James Nordstrom, co-chairman of Seattle-baseddepartment-store chain Nordstrom Inc., disagrees that theretail insider selling signals bearishness. He said he sold200,000 of his more than three million shares in April for&quot;liquidity&quot; and because the price at the time was attractive.While business &quot;isn't great,&quot; at Nordstrom, &quot;that's probablytrue of the industry right now.&quot;   Eight Nordstrom insiders trimmed their holdings by a totalof 424,747 shares in March through May, SEC filings show.Their shares fetched an average price of $35.07 each. Thestock has continued to climb since, closing yesterday at$42.75 a share, up $1.50 a share in national over-the-countertrading.   Executives at several other concerns declined to commenton the selling by groups of insiders of their company stock.   Taken together, retailing-industry insiders have been netsellers of over 13.4 million shares in the second quarter, a&quot;wave of selling,&quot; according to Invest/Net, a North Miami,Fla., firm that tracks and analyzes SEC data.

Three insiders, including the company chairman, soldshares of Dayton Hudson Corp. in April and May, SEC filingsshow. They sold a total of 28,820 shares of theMinneapolis-based department-store chain for $2.2 million,according to the filings.
