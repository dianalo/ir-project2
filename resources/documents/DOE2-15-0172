A simple model for the energy-dependent lossterm is adopted in the Fokker-Planck equation. The case of the minorityion heating by fundamental cyclotron resonance is analysed. It is foundthat the high energy particle loss imposes a limit on the heating powerdensity, above which an increase in the heating power does not raisethe energy transfer to the bulk particles, i.e. the heating efficiencydeteriorates. This power limit is serious for losses with strong energydependence such as ripple diffusion. Small spatial loss can annihilatethe increment of the fusion reaction by tail generation.
