Helping to calm jittery oil markets yesterday was a signalfrom Saudi Arabia, leading producer in the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries, that seemed to suggest it mayhold output to quota for a few more weeks, even if othersoverproduce.</LP><TEXT>   That didn't stop yesterday's price declines of as much as31 cents a barrel in U.S. petroleum futures trading. Butthere wasn't any further evidence of the panic selling thathad characterized oil markets for the past several days.   In European markets, spot prices of Middle East and NorthSea crudes actually were marginally higher. But on London'sInternational Petroleum Exchange futures prices of the NorthSea Brent crude closed lower by three cents to 14 cents abarrel.   The bigger drops were in U.S. petroleum futures anddeveloped late in the trading day. The New York MercantileExchange's July crude contract fell 31 cents a barrel tosettle at $17.83. Traders said this broke through importanttechnical support points and may signal some further softnesstoday.   In other market developments, refiners' field postings forWest Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude, settled 50cents a barrel lower at $17 a barrel. According to Dow JonesInternational Petroleum Report, Mexico effectively reducedJune contract prices for crude oil exported to U.S. buyers by20 cents to 30 cents.   The industry's fundamental factors still appear bearish.The world is awash in crude oil from high OPEC output. Thereis a massive overhang of crude inventories in the U.S. Andeven if runaway OPEC production is beginning to slow, on-landinventories could continue to build in the U.S. and in Europeas the oil tankers now at sea reach shore and unload theircargoes.   As a result, few oil economists are brash enough to arguethat prices may have reached their lows for the year. Butthey are beginning to suggest that a turnaround could soon bein sight.   Dennis Winters, an oil economist and DRI/McGraw-Hillsenior associate, is among those who believe a price bottomis nearing, even though the short-term outlook remains weak.&quot;With the {production} problems in the North Sea, priceswould already be headed higher if storage wasn't chockablockfull,&quot; he said.   Much depends, of course, on OPEC -- and, morespecifically, on Saudi Arabia, its kingpin producer.   According to the Oil Daily's Energy Compass, which closelyfollows OPEC developments, Saudi Arabia has decided to bideits time for a few weeks more after cutting its own volume.&quot;Current Saudi thinking is to wait for early indications ofJune output volumes&quot; in Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates,chronic OPEC overproducers, &quot;before taking any decision onwhether or not to reverse its instantly applied 300,000 to400,000 barrels a day {in} volume cuts,&quot; the London-basedpublication reported.   Yesterday, Hisham Nazer, the Saudi oil minister,emphasized in the strongest terms yet that the kingdom hadcommitted itself at the May 2 OPEC meeting to abide by itsofficial quota, and he urged other OPEC members to do thesame. According to the official government statement issuedfor Mr. Nazer, the oil minister &quot;made clear that the kingdomof Saudi Arabia would never market a single barrel outsideits agreed quota of 5.38 million a day.&quot;   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          GRAINS andamp; SOYBEANS: Corn and soybean futures prices movedhigher throughout most of the trading session on expectationsof renewed export demand from the Soviet Union. Wire-servicereports quoted Soviet officials as saying the country haspaid off the approximately $250 million it owed U.S. graincompanies, sparking market rumors that such payments are aprelude to the Soviets' return to the U.S. grain markets.Over the weekend Soviet newspapers carried criticism of thatcountry's grain-import officials for squandering scarce hardcurrency on poorly timed and inefficient import programs overthe past year, which they said contributed to the country'srecent export-payment problems. Also supporting prices wereworries about a return of wet weather across many Midwesterngrowing areas, which may hamper planting. The NationalWeather Service's six-to-10-day forecast, released after theclose of trading Wednesday, called for precipitation acrossmuch of the Midwest and normal to below-normal temperatures.Soybean futures for July delivery gained 6.75 cents a bushelto close at $6.1550. July corn futures added 4.25 cents abushel to close at $2.8050.                                                                                                          PRECIOUS METALS: Gold futures trading turned quiet in thewake of Wednesday's plunge, with prices recovering slightly.Silver edged lower while platinum posted a modest gain. Junedelivery gold ended $2.30 an ounce higher at $366.90, aftertrading in a relatively narrow range. July silver was off0.30 cent an ounce to $527.50. Platinum rose $2.50 an ounceto $500.70. There was active demand for gold bullion,according to one analyst. &quot;The problem was that buyers werestill bargain-hunting, and they couldn't find many sellers atthe low prices, so there wasn't much trading,&quot; he said.Another analyst observed that futures turned quiet becauseWednesday's selling simply lacked follow-through. Theobservance of Ascension Thursday, a religious holiday, inEurope, also contributed to the slower trading pace, he said.                                                                                                          SUGAR: Futures prices rose because of concern about theprogress of the European beet-sugar crop. The July contractended with a gain of 0.45 cent a pound at 14.80 cents, whichwas just under the day's high of 14.82 cents. Stephen Platt,analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds, Chicago, said dry weatherhad prevailed during the past month over Eastern Europe andthe Soviet Union's sugar-beet growing areas. &quot;If it persistsinto June, it could affect production,&quot; he said. According toanother analyst, dry weather was becoming a factor for thesugar-beet crops in Poland and France. The beets have beenplanted and need the proper combination of sun and moistureto grow properly. Also a possible contributing factor, thesecond analyst said, was the continuing uncertainty about howmuch sugar Brazil will have available to ship into the worldmarket from its 1990-91 crop, with a season that begins nextFriday. Brazil has to decide how much of the cane harvestwill be allocated for the production of alcohol forautomotive fuel and how much to earmark for export as sugar,the analyst said. The problem has been hanging over the worldsugar market for some time, as Brazil is traditionally amajor sugar exporter, and it now appears that the concern isgrowing as the harvest nears, the analyst said.</TEXT></DOC>
