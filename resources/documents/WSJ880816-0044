Under the terms of the revised plan, Consumers Power Co., CMS's principal subsidiary, will sell its Palisades plant near South Haven, Mich., to the new generating company at book value, estimated at about $365 million, for cash and a 44% interest in the new company. Bechtel's Bechtel Power Corp. unit and other investors will own the remaining 56%.    The revised plan also calls for Bechtel to make two additional payments of $50 million each to Consumers Power, one when the definitive agreements for the new company are completed and the other when the sale is closed. CMS said it expects to complete the agreements by the end of the year and to close the sale in the first half of 1989.    The original agreement, announced in October, envisioned CMS selling the plant to the new company for $550 million in cash and a 33% interest in the new company. It also called for only one additional $50 million payment.    A spokesman for CMS said other terms of the agreement haven't changed. He said the revisions followed &quot;further economic analysis&quot; by both sides and a realization that setting up the joint venture company &quot;turned out to be a much more complex process than anyone had thought.&quot;    The deal settles &quot;all outstanding issues and disputed claims&quot; between Bechtel and Consumers Power over another Consumers Power's nuclear plant in Midland, Mich., which is being converted to a gas-fired cogeneration facility. Bechtel was the builder for Midland, which incurred huge cost overruns that pushed Consumers Power to the brink of a bankruptcy-law filing several years ago.    CMS, based here, is an energy and power holding company. Closely held Bechtel is a San Francisco-based construction and engineering concern. </TEXT></DOC>
