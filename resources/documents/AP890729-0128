But the Valdez faced final navigational and environmentalinspections before it would be allowed into the bay on Sunday.   The ship that caused the nation's worst oil spill was under towSaturday, scheduled to reach the pilot's buoy at the mouth of SanDiego Bay late Saturday, said Coast Guard Lt. Larry Solberg.   Since Friday night's departure from waters near San ClementeIsland, 56 miles from here, the ship has been under constantmonitoring for the types of discharges that three weeks ago causedit to be turned away from San Diego as a pollution risk.   Under an agreement between Exxon Shipping Co. and five stateagencies, the Valdez must be leak-free for a 24-hour period priorto entering San Diego Bay en route to National Steel andShipbuilding Co. for a nine-month, $25 million repair job.   Exxon put up $20 million to ensure its performance and to coverthe costs of a cleanup should a spill occur during the Valdez'sentry.   Solberg said the ship successfully executed a series of steeringand engine tests Friday night and there were no visible signs ofdischarges.   The Valdez, assisted by tugboats, was expected to come into thebay on its own power under the guidance of senior San Diego harborpilot Capt. Edward Silva Jr.   Meanwhile, Greenpeace activists said they would trail the Valdezthrough the harbor with five sailboats and four inflatable craft inan on-the-water protest.   ``We're going to have a little flotilla out there but we're nottrying to block it in any way,'' said Greenpeace spokeswoman BlairPalese. ``We want to demonstrate our concern and to bring publicattention to the need for a long-term nontoxic energy policy.''   Solberg said the Valdez would be surrounded by eight Coast Guardand Harbor Patrol vessels during the bay transit and a movingsafety zone will be enforced 500 yards to the tanker's front and300 yards from the sides and stern.   A final underwater inspection with a remote camera was plannedwhen the ship arrived at the pilot's buoy.   ``The purpose of the survey is to determine if the vesselsustained any bottom damage during its transit from San ClementeIsland and to verify the vessel is in safe condition to transit SanDiego Bay,'' Solberg said.   More than 100 tons of dangling steel plates were sheared whenthey tore loose from the hull framing during the ship's 2,500-milevoyage from Alaska, where the vessel rammed a reef March 24.   The Valdez's hull split open in the accident, and almost 11million gallons of crude spilled into Prince William Sound. Thespill devastated hundreds of miles of Alaskan coastline andwildlife habitat, and cleanup work is ongoing.</TEXT></DOC>
