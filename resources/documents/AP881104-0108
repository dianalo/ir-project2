The source, speaking Thursday on condition of anonymity, saidParkin has been told he ``will be indicted unless he comes in andcuts a deal, which he is not going to do.''   Parkin has told reporters that he believes he broke no laws inrunning his Alexandria, Va., consulting business. Although thesource would not reveal details of the plea bargain offer, he saidthe terms were stiff.   Last week, Henry E. Hudson, the U.S. attorney in Alexandria, Va.,said the first indictments in the investigation into the$150-billion-a-year defense procurement business could come laterthis month.   The 2-year-old investigation centers on allegations thatconsultants paid bribes to Defense Department officials to gatherinside information that was useful to companies bidding on themultimillion-dollar projects.   Sharon Dibbley, a spokeswoman for Hudson, said the prosecutorwould not comment on reports that plea-bargain arrangements had beenoffered. Earlier, however, government and defense sources indicatedthat Hudson's assistants had been kept waiting for responses fromsome potential defendants to offers of plea bargains.   Prosecutors are known to be looking at a broad variety of chargesin the investigation, including bribery, fraud, conspiracy, theft ofgovernment property and tax violations.   Hudson is running the bribery investigation that came to light inJune when FBI agents staged raids at more than 40 locations aroundthe country. Justice Department officials who spoke on condition ofanonymity predicted that about a half dozen people will be indictedinitially by a grand jury. Hudson said indictments could continueover a year.   Attempts to reach Parkin for comment were unsuccessful. No oneanswered his telephone on two occasions, and his lawyer, GerardTreanor, declined to comment.   In interviews with The Wall Street Journal last summer, Parkinsaid he paid Fred Lackner, a California-based consultant, more than$15,000 to obtain inside information on a Navy contract foranti-aircraft equipment.   Lackner said he received some information from Stuart Berlin, aNavy engineer, but he said the information was public knowledge.   The Journal, quoting unnamed sources, reported Thursday thatprosecutors also would seek an indictment against Lackner, who couldnot be reached for comment. Lackner also was offered a pleabargaining deal, the paper said.   Lackner's attorney, William Dougherty, was out of the country andwas unavailable for comment.   Parkin has told reporters that he and Lackner shared consultingfees from Teledyne Electronics of Newbury Park, Calif.   One source familiar with the case has said the Teledyne aspectswere the furthest along in the investigation.   This source, speaking anonymously, also said Jack Sherman, aMarine Corps official, was believed to have reached or be nearreaching a plea bargain with prosecutors.   The Journal's sources said prosecutors have evidence that Shermanaccepted more than $40,000 in cash from defense consultants andtheir associates in a one-year period. Sherman's lawyer, LouisKoutoulakos, did not return telephone messages.   In a related development, the Defense Contract Audit Agency hasfound the Pentagon's procurement regulations are so vague that majordefense contractors have been allowed to bill the government formillions of dollars for outside consultants without justifying orexplaining their work.   In a review of 12 of the top 100 defense contractors, theauditors labeled as ``questionable'' claims for $43 million out ofthe $236.5 million they charged to the government over the past yearfor consultant services.</TEXT></DOC>
