The agreement calling for Israelis to withdraw from the 250-acreresort by March 15 was signed at the Sonesta hotel in Taba, northernSinai.   Both sides joined U.S. mediators in expressing hope that futuredisputes between Israel and its Arab neighbors can be solved throughnegotiations.   ``A new chapter is starting and we sincerely hope it will lead tothe road of a comprehensive peace,'' said Egypt's chief negotiator,Nabil El-Araby.   His Israeli counterpart, Foreign Ministry Director-General ReuvenMerhav added: ``It is a splended example and a shining beacon ofhope. We in Israel believe negotiations are the only possible pathto peace.''   A key point of the accord will allow Israelis to visit the resortfor up to 14 days without visas or special entry fees. Israel alsowill continue supplying water and electricity to the area.   The agreement was approved Sunday by Israel's 10-member innerCabinet by a 8-1 vote with one abstention.   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who voted for the agreement, saidhe nevertheless regretted the results.   ``To my great sorrow the drama has ended as it has ended,''Shamir said at a Sunday night rally of his right-wing Likud bloc innorthern Israel.   ``My stand was well known. I opposed the turn to arbitration andinstead wanted to turn to compromise,'' he said. ``If we had agreedto compromise we would not have had to leave Taba,'' he said.   Shamir and the Likud opposed the agreement in 1986 to enterbinding arbitration. They preferred non-binding negotiations.   International arbitrators on Sept. 29 delineated the border insuch a way as to put the beach in Egypt. Israel delayedimplementation of the ruling pending negotiations over obtainingeasy access for tourists and receiving compensation for the hoteland a neighboring holiday village.   Under the agreement, Egypt will purchase the Sonesta for $37million and the holiday village for $1.5 million.   Egypt's Tourism Minister, Fuad Sultan, said Israeli tourists willbe ``extremely welcome.''   The dispute over Taba, which borders on the southern Israeli portof Eilat, began in April 1982 when Israel refused to withdraw fromthe strip as it ended a 15-year occupation of the bulk of the SinaiDesert.</TEXT></DOC>
