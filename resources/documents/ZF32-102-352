 Onthe eve of that first EWC, held in Boston, DR sponsored Insight '88, whichfeatured a panel of workstation luminaries including David Nelson, founderand chief technical officer of Apollo; Robert Miller, chairman and CEO ofMips Computer Systems; and key workstation executives from DEC,Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Stellar (now Stardent) and Silicon Graphics.andM;Two seeks ago, as in previous years, DR chaired EWC's technology forecastpanel, which focuses on what end users can expect from the varioustechnologies--from chip fabrication to video display--shaping today's andtomorrow's workstation.andP;  Surprisingly, considering all that's gone on amongDEC, Mips and Microsoft on one hand and IBM, Apple and Motorola on the other,one of the most provocative insights this year originated four years ago.andM;This year, Lynn Thorsen-Jensen, graphics product manager at Evans andamp;Sutherland and now a regular member of the technology forecast panels, lookedback at at that first EWC panle's forecast for 1992.andP;  Back then, IBM'sprojections of the 75- to 100-VUP desktop seemed to fall somewhere betweenoutrageous and foolhardy, but they now appear prescient.andP;  That same year, DECmade the most conservative projections for RISC in 1992: CPU power forhigh-end desktop systems only in the range of 20 to 40 VUPs.andM;Following this retrospective, Paul Bemis, HP's program manager for RISCtechnology, taunted members of the rival ACE consortium, stating that systemvendors, without control of their own RISC architecture--the RISC chipitself--cannot hope to hold onto the cutting edge of the price/performancecurve.andP;  On that point, I expected the DEC member of the panel to objectemphatically.andM;Instead, he agreed!andP;  The new Holy Grail at DEC appears to be the Alphaproject to put VMS on DEC's own RISC chip.andP;  But though the promise of a100-VUP Alpha/VMS system is tantalizing, the real quest is for compatibilitybetween Alpha/VMS and VAX/VMS.andM;The chanllenge here is dealing with the elegant complexity of the VAXarchitecture, which makes it the least RISC-like of any CISC architecture.andO;Although a reduced number of instructions in a set is a facile way formarketeers to characterize RISC, the engineering reality is that the numberof instructions is meaningless: it's the complexity of those instructionsthat really matters.andM;The secret to high-speed RISC performance lies in simple instructions thatcan be executed straightforwardly, with minimal exception handling.andP;  For thatreason, HP, IBM, Intel, Mips, Motorola and Sun RISC architectures all haveone instruction size.andP;  Not so the VAX; its variable-length instrictopm fpr,at,ales separating instructions during decoding all the more complex.andP;  Andthat's just the beginning.andP;  The data that these instructions act on must bereadily available from memory.andP;  To that end, HP, IBM, Intel, Mips, Motorola,and Sun RISC architectures insist on direct addressing of data.andP;  Not so theVAX; under its complex indirect addressing scheme, data access can meancomputing one memory address whose only role is to point to another, whichactually contains the data.andP;  Most characteristically of RISC, the HP, IBM,Intel, Mips, Motorola and Sun architectures always separate data fetches fromarithmetic operations.andP;  Not so the VAX.andM;But why should it be more complicated for DEC to move VMS from the VAX to itsown Alpha RISC architecture than it was for DEC to port UItrix from the VAXto Mips' RISC architecture?andP;  Because DEC must engineer the solution to meet ahigher level of performance expectations, as well as compatibility with allexisting VMS applications.andM;If Alpha RISC is to be a successful long-range solution, DEC must engineer atrue RISC architecture, not market an ersatz RISC architecture.andP;  At the sametime, to break the bonds VMS macro code has with the current VAXarchitecture, DEC must entirely rewrite VMS in a high-level compiledlanguage.andP;  Otherwise, the machine code needed to emulate VAX macro on Alphawill be about as efficient as the Soviet economy.andM;Then there is the issue of software compatibility.andP;  In the Unix world, endusers are happy when just source code is marginally portable.andP;  But in the VMSworld, source-code compatibility is a sine qua non and binary compatibilityis de rigueur.andP;  Enabling a RISC processor to decode and execute today'scompiled VAX code is going to be no easy task for DEC.andP;  Nouveau VAXophileswho never ran under PDP-11 compatibility mode could have quite a surprise instore!andM;With all of this left to sort out, I wouldn't trade in my Mips-basedDECstation for an Alpha-based VAXstation just yet.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
