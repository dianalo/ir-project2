(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   When Rogaine was unveiled last Septemberby the Upjohn Co. as the first scientifically proven hair-lossremedy, financial analysts envisioned desperate balding men runningto doctors for prescriptions.   Today, those analysts and many consumers are disappointed, andUpjohn is preparing a new, more aggressive marketing campaign aimedat men whose embarrassment at seeking help for their hair loss mayhave prevented them from trying the drug.   Upjohn says it is pleased with Rogaine's performance and blamesdrug-industry analysts _ some of whom predicted 1989 U.S. saleswould top $300 million _ for unrealistic expectations.   ``Any new product that saw the sales that Rogaine did in thefirst few months would be deemed an outstanding success,'' saidUpjohn spokeswoman Kaye Bennett. ``We expected to succeed in thelong run, while the analysts thought it would be a runawaysuccess.''   Disappointed consumers also may have set unrealisticexpectations by ignoring Upjohn's warnings that Rogaine wouldn'twork for most men.   Though Upjohn does not release sales figures for specificproducts, drug industry analyst Ronald Nordmann of PaineWebber Inc.estimated domestic sales for Rogaine accounted for $11 million ofthe Kalamazoo-based company's $755 million in net sales for thefirst three months of 1989.   While Rogaine's sales were more than double those for the fourthquarter of 1988, Nordmann said he interpreted the figures asdisappointing.   ``The product has certainly been slow out of the startinggate,'' he said.   There are many reasons for Rogaine's sluggish sales, researchersand hair-loss specialists say. Among them:   _Upjohn's 8-month-old, $20 million advertising campaign,featuring a man walking along a beach with the ``see your doctor''phrase, may have been too low-key and vague.   _The price, about $50 for a one-month supply and the necessarylifelong commitment to its use.   Once you stop using Rogaine, any hair you may have grown backwill fall out. If the drug has stopped your hair loss, you'll makeup for lost time as soon as you quit.   Most baffling, however, is that companies featuring bogusbaldness remedies on late-night television continue to outsellRogaine by a ratio of about 10-to-1, said Mike Mahoney, presidentof the American Hair Loss Council.   ``The biggest deterrent to Rogaine is that the man has to go tohis doctor and admit that he is not comfortable with his hair loss.With the others, he can call a 1-800 number from the privacy of hisown home,'' said Mahoney, whose non-profit organization providesconsumer information on hair-loss treatments.   Upjohn's new marketing campaign, beginning in mid-May, willfeature a toll-free number. The consumer will be connected with ahair-care specialist to discuss Rogaine and then will receiveinformation on Rogaine via mail.   Like the previous ads, Upjohn still won't refer to the drug byname. U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulations prohibitcompanies from advertising prescription drugs by name unless therealso is a full disclosure of any warnings and potential sideeffects.   The company has released few details about its new marketingstrategy, but says it's designed to identify and target the marketfor the drug, which was approved by the FDA last August.   Though analysts see the new campaign as Upjohn's reaction toslow sales, the company insists the more aggressive campaign alwayswas part of its marketing strategy.   Some of the blame for disappointment with Rogaine's results alsolies with the consumer, who may have been expecting too much.Upjohn warned consumers from the start that the tonic wouldn't workat all for most men.   Rogaine, the trade name for a substance called minoxidil, isrecommended for men younger than 40 who have been losing hair for10 years or less and who have an area of baldness 4 inches indiameter or less on the crown of the head.   Clinical trials showed about 39 percent of men suffering frommale-pattern baldness will either grow some new hair back or stoplosing hair after six to eight months on the drug.   ``If you're going to use this stuff, you've got to be patientand use it for a year,'' said Dr. David Whiting, medical directorof the Baylor (University) Hair Research and Treatment Center inDallas, Texas. ``Otherwise, you'll never know if it would haveworked.''   Bert Camp, a railroad engineer in Mineola, Texas, saw resultsafter about three months on Rogaine.   ``Since I started using it, I've definitely seen some new hairgrowing,'' said Camp, 46. ``And for 10 years, I've been usingeverything that I could get my hands on to stop hair loss.''   Still, Camp said Rogaine was ``too expensive, especially sinceI'm going to have to use it for the next 20 or 30 years.''   At the 2,270-store Rite Aid pharmacy chain in Harrisburg, Pa.,spokeswoman Suzanne Mead said Rogaine sales had been slower thanexpected.   Rogaine may almost double its market if the FDA approves it foruse by women. Of the 50 million Americans losing their hair, 20million are women, and clinical trials have found the drug to beslightly more effective on women, Bennett said.   Upjohn also is working on advanced application methods for thealcohol-based solution, which tends to be messy to apply, as wellas teaming up with Procter andamp; Gamble Co. on new ingredients designedto increase efficacy and create new minoxidil products, such as acream.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, April 30</NOTE></DOC>
