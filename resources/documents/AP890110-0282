The White House Council of Economic Advisers, in PresidentReagan's final economic report, said reducing protection fordepositors would cause them to more closely ``monitor the financialhealth'' of the institutions holding their money.   But Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, who is working on anSandamp;L plan for the administration of President-elect Bush, said in astatement released through Rep. Chalmers Wylie of Ohio, seniorRepublican on the House Banking Committee, that ``curtailing depositinsurance is not an option and will not be considered.''   Banking Committee Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, said agradual reduction in the $100,000 insurance limit may be consideredas part of the overall solution to the thrift crisis. However, headded, ``lowering the amount of deposit insurance is a very seriousmatter, not a matter to be thrown out as a trial balloon.''   Although Reagan's report did not address the question, Beryl W.Sprinkel, the president's chief economic adviser, said that as partof the insurance curb, institutions should be required to publiclydisclose more information about their financial condition.   The administration also sharply criticized Sandamp;L regulators for``postponing the day of reckoning'' in their rescues of failedinstitutions.   But the top regulator, M. Danny Wall, chairman of the FederalHome Loan Bank Board, defended his agency's year-end spree ofsavings and loan bailouts as cheaper than shutting the failedinstitutions down and paying off depositors.   Wall, a Reagan appointee, said at a briefing outlining histestimony today before the House Banking Committee that his agencyrescued 75 institutions in December at a cost of $16.3 billion to bespread out over 10 years.   Tax benefits arising from the deals will cost the government anadditional $4 billion over 10 years.   The alternative to the rescues _ liquidating the Sandamp;Ls andshutting them down _ would have required $47 billion in ``up-frontcash,'' far more than is available immediately to the FederalSavings and Loan Insurance Corp., Wall said.   By selling off the property of the failed Sandamp;Ls, regulatorseventually would have recouped all but $22.8 billion on the Decembertransactions, he said.   The board supervises nearly 3,000 federally insured Sandamp;Ls.   Both banks and Sandamp;Ls are failing in numbers not seen since theGreat Depression. Reagan's report noted that the problems will be``one of the major challenges for the next administration'' underPresident-elect Bush.   While Reagan placed much of the blame on regulators, theadministration's own record has come under fire as well. Criticspoint out that the administration refused to pay for additional Sandamp;Lexaminers while the problem was developing.   In the final Reagan budget, released Monday, the administrationcalled for spending $64 billion on Sandamp;Ls through 1994 andacknowledged for the first time that it does not have enough moneycoming in to handle the cleanup.   Citing the 1980 decision by Congress to boost the limit ondeposit insurance from $40,000 to $100,000, Reagan's economic reportsaid reducing the ceiling ``would restore much-needed discipline tothe system.''   ``The scope of federal deposit insurance should be significantlycurtailed,'' it said. However, it did not recommend a specificlimit, nor did it say whether the curtailment should apply toexisting deposits or only to future deposits.   Deposit insurance discourages bank runs and provides individualswith a safe place for their money, but it ``also dramaticallyreduces the incentives for depositors to monitor the financialhealth of their bank,'' the administration said.   It was particularly critical of regulators' de facto policy ofguaranteeing deposits above the insurance limit in largeinstitutions.   Mary-Liz Meany, a spokeswoman for the American BankersAssociation, said her organization does not support rolling backlimits on deposit insurance, but believes the current $100,000ceiling should be enforced to expose depositors to some risk.   With virtually all deposits now protected, ``the depositor has noincentive to be careful with his or her dollars,'' she said.   ``The system has become a license for abuse for some financialmanagers,'' she added. ``Before we change the current system ... weshould try to make the current system work efficiently by allowinggreater market discipline.''   Jon Brown, director of the Ralph Nader-sponsored consumer groupBank Watch, said rolling back insurance limits would encourage morediscipline in the system,but should be part of a broader program tomore strictly regulate banks and savings and loans.   The recommendation contradicts a study released last week by theFDIC, which concluded that deposit insurance should be preserved atcurrent levels. FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman said regulatorshave been unwilling to tolerate the risk to the banking system offorcing losses on depositors at large institutions, even those whosefunds exceed the insurance limit.   Noting estimates of the Sandamp;L problem ranging up to $100 billion,the Council of Economic Advisers said ``a large portion of thepayment of this bill will need to come directly from the public.''The rest will be levied indirectly on consumers through fees chargedbanks and Sandamp;Ls, it said.   It also said ``most regulatory actions taken so far merely serveto postpone the problem ... (and) will sharply increase costs to thegeneral public.'' Sandamp;L regulators' practice of guaranteeing newowners of rescued Sandamp;Ls against losses for up to 10 years weakens theincentive to manage efficiently, it said.   Wall, at the briefing Monday night in advance of his testimonytoday, cited two benefits of rescuing institutions now and spreadingout the cost rather than waiting to accumulate the money forliquidations.   First, he said, the bank board stops the operating losses at therescued institutions. Second, it eases the need for the institutionsto pay above-market interest rates to attract depositors. That inturn eases the pressure on still-healthy Sandamp;Ls to compete by raisingtheir rates.   Wall said the December spending spree left the FSLIC board with$3 billion at yearend. He said the insurance fund would maintain abalance of $1 billion to $3 billion through 1989, but he revealedthat a crunch, requiring additional borrowing, may arise in lessthan two years.   In 1987, Congress authorized the bank board to borrow $10.6billion by selling bonds through September 1990. It has borrowedabout half that so far.   When the remaining bond authority runs out and if Congress doesnot provide alternate funding, Wall said the bank board may have toissue special ``premium anticipation notes,'' which will be paid offwith revenue the board expects to collect over the next 30 years.   Including the December pledges, the bank board last yearcommitted more than $38 billion to resolve the cases of 205institutions. Wall declined to say how much more his agency had leftto promise, but he said, ``We could do another $16 billioncomfortably.''</TEXT></DOC>
