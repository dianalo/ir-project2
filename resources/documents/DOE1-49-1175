The image processingservice described here uses a commercial digital network to connect thecomputers of CT scanners. The network service shares image processingtasks with remote sites during the times that the scanners are otherwiseidle. The network is nationwide, emphasizes resource sharing, uses moderate-bandwidth(4800 or 9600 baud, i.e., 480 or 960 characters/sec) dedicated leasedtelephone lines, and is restricted at this time to only a few types ofCT scanner. Furthermore, because it offers services that are not interactive,it is able to optimize computer resources without routine interruptionfrom users. Discussion begins by a brief overview of classic computernetwork topologies, with an emphasis on their application to CT, magneticresonance imaging (MRI), and other medical imaging modalities. This somewhattechnical introduction to networks demonstrates the unique characteristicsof medical image communication as opposed to the more common applicationsof computer communication in the banking, retail, and management informationindustries. In the sections that follow, a more selective focus is madeon the topology, hardware, image-processing, and operational characteristicsof a network that is now composed of over 50 CT scanner systems throughoutthe United States. The chapter concludes by summarizing the network performanceduring its first 35 months of operation.</TEXT></DOC>
