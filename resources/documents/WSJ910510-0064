The 53-year-old Mr. Ueberroth, who made a name for himselfas the organizer of the 1984 Los Angeles Summer Olympics andlater as baseball commissioner, is trying to duplicate thosesuccesses by restoring troubled companies to health.</LP><TEXT>   About 18 months ago, Mr. Ueberroth and some colleaguesquietly formed Contrarian Group Inc., which aspires to be asort of corporate SWAT team for the 1990s. It already hastackled the job of trying to turn around HAL Inc.'s HawaiianAirlines unit, the U.S. unit of German sports-shoe makerAdidas AG and other ailing concerns, with mixed results.   Mr. Ueberroth isn't alone. A cottage industry is growingaround the country involving efforts similar to that of theContrarian Group. Irwin Jacobs, one of the most fearedcorporate raiders of the 1980s, for example, has forsakenhostile takeovers and is trying to raise $1 billion to makefriendly investments in companies that are troubled or thathe views as undervalued.   The Contrarian Group consists of 18 entrepreneurialexecutives sprinkled around North America; each is a partnerin the group, sharing in its profits. The idea is to findtroubled companies, put a Contrarian in charge and acquire anequity stake that would grow in value as the company returnsto financial health.   Currently, Contrarians are at the helm of 10 companies inindustries ranging from shoes to insurance. OtherContrarians, such as John Martin, a former RJR Nabisco seniorexecutive, are waiting in the wings.   Mr. Ueberroth says Contrarian Group was born out of theexcesses of the 1980s. &quot;It became clear to me that businesscouldn't keep running by just doing financial deals,&quot; hesays. &quot;If we were going to compete internationally, somebodywas actually going to have to start running businesses.&quot;   That isn't a contrarian notion these days. It has becomefashionable to trash the last decade as a time when almostany lout could turn tycoon if he could spell LBO and load acompany up with a billion dollars in junk bonds. &quot;EverywhereI turn I seem to hear this back-to-basics argument being madein business,&quot; says Jon Goodman, director of the entrepreneurprogram at the University of Southern California.   Contrarian ownership in companies under management runsfrom 3% to 100%, though individual Contrarians invest littleor no money of their own, Mr. Ueberroth says. Their sharewill depend on how well they perform at the company, a sortof &quot;sweat equity.&quot; Some equity from each company will also gointo a general pot to be shared by the other Contrarians.   Mr. Ueberroth says that investor groups from Switzerland,Japan and Taiwan have been lined up to provide financing. Hedeclines to be more specific, but sources close to the groupsay it can raise up to $100 million per transaction.   While turnaround specialists are nothing new, Mr.Ueberroth is the most prominent of the current crop ofwould-be corporate fixer-uppers. After building and selling asuccessful travel business, he spent much of the past decadein the limelight. As head of the hugely successful 1984Olympics, he astonished the sporting world by making theevent produce a surplus.   Later, he was much in the news as baseball commissioner.His name regularly surfaces as a possible candidate forpublic office or as chief executive of some giant company.Just before the Contrarian effort began, he led anunsuccessful effort to purchase Eastern Airlines.   Some Contrarians were involved with the financialmaneuverings of the '80s. Mr. Ueberroth, for instance, is onthe board of Ardshiel Inc., a New York firm specializing inleveraged buy-outs. Mr. Martin was part of history's biggestLBO, the $25 billion buy-out of RJR Nabisco Inc. AnotherContrarian, Eriberto Scocimara has a resume that includestime as chairman of Miramar Marine Corp., a debt-laden boatmaker in Pulaski, Wis., that may soon be taken over by Mr.Jacobs.   Mr. Ueberroth declines to identify most of his fellowContrarians or what companies they are running. While he islisted as Contrarian Group president on California stateincorporation papers, he contends there really isn't ahierarchy.   But Mr. Ueberroth's reputation clearly helps make dealshappen, such as the January 1990 purchase of a controllinginterest in deeply troubled HAL by a Ueberroth-headedinvestment group. &quot;The only reason I'm in that investment isPeter Ueberroth,&quot; says real-estate developer George Argyros.Two other Contrarians -- airline entrepreneur Thomas Talbotand Mr. Ueberroth's brother, John -- are in charge ofoperating Hawaiian. But Mr. Argyros says, &quot;As far as I'mconcerned, Peter is the No. 1 man.&quot;   Hawaiian Airlines is not yet a Ueberroth success story.Indeed, after more than a year under Contrarian management,HAL remains deeply troubled. Last month, citing the PersianGulf war and recessionary pressures on its Hawaiian Airlinesunit, the company reported a 1990 net loss of $121.3 million;that was nearly triple the 1989 loss. To raise cash, HawaiianAirlines recently agreed to sell some of its Pacific routesand a 25% stake in the company to NWA Inc. for $20 million.   Nonetheless, says Randy Havre, an analyst with J.B. HavreSecurities in Honolulu, the Ueberroth team deserves creditfor improving customer relations and service. With the NWAcash infusion, there is still hope for a turnaround, he says.   Mr. Ueberroth also is the moving force behind a Contrarianeffort at Adidas USA. Once the premier athletic-shoe maker inthe U.S., Adidas USA in recent years became an also-ran,slogging through red ink. So parent Adidas AG turned to Mr.Ueberroth. It gave him a seat on its board and options to buy40% of Adidas USA and 4% of Adidas AG; neither option hasbeen exercised yet. Contrarian Group was given a $1 millionannual management fee.   Two Contrarians took over at Adidas USA. (Mr. Ueberroth'sson-in-law, who isn't a Contrarian, was also hired.) &quot;Whenyou engage Peter Ueberroth and his group, you give totalauthority to straighten things out. We don't want to getinvolved in things we can't operate,&quot; says Contrarian PeterPirner, a former Mattel Inc. executive who is now AdidasUSA's president.   With Andrew Hines, a former senior vice president at RJRNabisco, Mr. Pirner slashed overhead and improved markups.For 1990, Adidas USA had operating earnings of $2.2 million,compared with a $62.8 million loss in 1989, on a 3.6% drop insales to $228.9 million. While it's still uncertain whetherAdidas can come up with new products that will sell in theU.S. market, &quot;at least the company is no longer a joke,&quot; saysJohn Horan, editor of Sporting Goods Intelligence, anindustry newsletter.   Mr. Ueberroth says at some point he may take charge of aContrarian company. &quot;But so far,&quot; he says, &quot;there has alwaysbeen someone more qualified than me to do it.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
