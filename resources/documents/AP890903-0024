Police made58 arrests, but waited more than two hours before breaking up theprotest.   The crowd, estimated at 5,000 to 10,000, stretched for more thana mile along the shore, the biggest beach protest ever in SouthAfrica.   Organizers claimed a victory over segregation and vowed furtheracts of protest during a nationwide defiance campaign.   Several dozen whites, some carrying whips and wearing ``whitesonly'' T-shirts, yelled abuse as the throng paraded along thesegregated sections of South Africa's most heavily used beachfront.Other sections of the hotel-lined shore have been opened to allraces in recent years.   One angry white man barged into the crowd, yelling and pushing,but police said they could control the situation on their own. Somewhites yelled to the officers, ``Shoot them dead.''   At one point, police arrested about 10 black youths who unfurleda flag of the outlawed African National Congress guerrilla movement.They remained in custody late Sunday, but police said the other 48people arrested during the course of the protest were released aftera few hours.   The police contingent of several hundred officers was equippedwith shot guns and a water cannon, but they made no efforts to stopthe protesters from moving onto segregated Addington Beach.   In contrast, police used clubs and whips and arrested 500 peopleSaturday in Cape Town while breaking up a planned protest march toParliament.   White lifeguards remained at their posts during the beach protestand white surfers continued to paddle off the shore while blackchildren splashed nearby.   After about 2{ hours, police officers announced that the protestwas illegal and began moving the crowd away.   At a news conference later, protest leaders said they consideredthe event a success.   ``It's the dawn of a new age,'' said the Rev. Stanley Mogoba, aprominent Methodist leader.   More than 1,300 people, including prominent activists such asAnglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, have been arrested since Wednesdayin connection with the defiance campaign. Most have been releasedpending possible court action.   The defiance campaign began Aug. 2 and has intensified steadilyin the days leading to Wednesday's segregated parliamentaryelections, which exclude the black majority.   A two-day national protest _ probably including a general strike_ is planned for Tuesday and Wednesday by major anti-apartheidgroups.   The majority of the beach protesters were youths, many wearingyellow caps with the slogan ``Free the Beaches.'' The crowd includedmany Indians and some whites as well as blacks.   Local police officials had warned activists last week that theprotest could trigger violence, and some roadblocks were set up inan attempt to keep protesters away from the beach.   Police reported that several small bombs exploded Friday night intrash bins along the beachfront. Near the bins, pamphletspurportedly written by white right-wing extremists warned activistsnot to proceed with the protest.   Previous targets of the defiance campaign have includedsegregated hospitals, schools and buses. Many activists have defiedrestrictions imposed on them following their release from detention,and several banned organizations have declared that they wereresuming operations.   Protesters were whipped by police at a defiance protest at awhites-only beach near Cape Town on Aug. 19. At least two Cabinetministers of the governing National Party have expressed regret forthat incident, but the government has given no public indicationthat it is ready to make major changes in remaining segregation laws.   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregatedsociety in which the 28 million blacks have no vote in nationalaffairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintainseparate districts, schools and health services.</TEXT></DOC>
