<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-85-0085 </DOCNO><TEXT>An analysis to simulate the apparent carrier profiles of n-N heterojunctionsobtained from capacitance-voltage measurements is presented. The analysistakes into account the partial ionization and the frequency dependenceof the response of deep donors, if any, present in the N material. Inthe case of GaAs/AlGaAs heterojunctions, the latter effect has not beenincluded in the previous analyses but appears to be important since thereciprocal time constant of the Si-related DX centers in AlGaAs at roomtemperature seems to be comparable to the frequency of the test signal(1 MHz) normally used for capacitance measurements.</TEXT></DOC>
