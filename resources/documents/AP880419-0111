(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Former PTL evangelist Jim Bakker haswritten letters to a U.S. bankruptcy judge, PTL's trustee andsupporters asking for a chance to save the troubled ministry, anewspaper reported.   ``I believe it's time we have the chance to help save theministry God gave us a vision to build,'' Bakker said in the letterobtained by The Charlotte Observer. ``Please let Tammy and me,along with the partners who worked so hard to birth PTL andHeritage USA, fight for its right to continue.''   Bakker made the plea to U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds,trustee David Clark and PTL supporters. Bakker said the letter camein response to PTL's financial crisis and Reynolds' decision Fridayordering the ministry at Fort Mill, S.C., to begin planning its ownliquidation.   ``I once again ask for your forgiveness and for restoration,''Bakker wrote. ``I beg those who have the future of PTL in theirhands, before Heritage USA is torn apart and sold, please let thefounders have ninety days to try, under God, to save what I believeto be a God-given vision.''   The two-page letter also touches on the financial troubles thathave plagued PTL since Bakker resigned in March 1987 afteracknowledging a sexual encounter with Jessica Hahn and the paymentof hush money to her.   Bakker and his former top aides are under investigation by afederal grand jury in Charlotte for possible mail, wire and taxfraud. The investigation is focusing on how PTL spent millions ofdollars in contributions under Bakker's leadership, and whetherBakker and his associates broke federal laws against raising moneyfor one purpose and using it for another.   The Internal Revenue Service claims PTL owes at least $55.7million in back taxes and wants to revoke its tax exempt status.   PTL spokesman David West said Monday that Clark would have nocomment because PTL is pursuing legal action against the Bakkers.   Bakker's attorney says the former evangelist plans to come toNorth Carolina within the next six weeks to meet with stateAssemblies of God officials and to seek forgiveness. Thedenomination defrocked Bakker nearly a year ago.   Lawyer Jim Toms called the move a ``peace-making mission,'' andsaid Bakker hopes to ``right whatever wrongs that can be righted.''   Toms said Bakker is not interested in reinstatement to theAssemblies of God.   ``He's not asking for a job,'' Toms told the Observer. ``It'sexpressly designed not to request anything of them exceptforgiveness. He wants to clear the air and say `I'm sorry thingswent badly.'''</TEXT></DOC>
