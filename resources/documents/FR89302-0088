(Case No. RF272-42583) (Johnson)should have been granted a refund based on a much larger gallonage. Accordingly,this Decision rescinds <T3>James W. Stewart,</T3> with respect to Johnson. Johnson's applicationbased on the correct gallonage will be considered at a later date undera new case number.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corporation, 1/19/89, RF272-10027 and RD272-10027</T3>Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corporation (O-C) filed an Application for Refundfrom crude oil monies available for disbursement under 10 C.F.R. Part 205,Subpart V, based upon its purchases of refined petroleum products, duringthe period August 19, 1973 through January 27, 1981. A group of thirtyStates and two Territories (collectively ``the States'') filed objectionsin opposition to the receipt of any refund by O-C on the basis that thefirm had suffered no actual injury as a result of crude oil overcharges.In addition, the States filed a Motion for Discovery. In considering O-C'srefund application, the DOE determined that the firm had consumed petroleumproducts, principally asphalt, in the production of fiberglas-based constructionmaterials. Thus, the DOE determined that O-C was presumptively injuredby crude oil overcharges based upon the presumption of injury accordedto end-users outside of the petroleum industry. The DOE further determinedthat the States had failed to rebut the presumption of injury in theirobjections since the States' general showing with regard to O-C's profitabilityand industry-wide data pertaining to the construction industry were notsufficiently probative of the extent to which O-C actually passed throughincreased petroleum product costs. On the same basis, the DOE determinedthat the States had failed to support adequately their Motion for Discovery.Accordingly, O-C's Application for Refund was approved, and the States'objections and Motion for Discovery were denied. The total refund amountapproved in this Decision and Order is $662.319.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Standard Oil Co.

(Indiana) (Amoco I) special refund proceeding.The tribe requested permission to use $805 in Amoco I monies to purchasetwo items, a setback thermostat control device and a battery charger timer.In light of the small sum of money involved, the DOE found the plan tobe adequately restitutionary. Accordingly, the tribe's request was granted.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Total Petroleum/Madden Oil Company, 1/19/89, RF310-337</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order in which it reconsidered an Applicationfor Refund filed by Madden Oil Company, a motor gasoline and diesel fuelreseller, in the Total Petroleum special refund proceeding. After a thoroughevaluation of Madden's refund claim and the examination of a separate refundclaim advanced by Madden in an earlier refund proceeding, the DOE determinedthat Madden was granted a refund on December 20, 1988 to which it was notentitled. The $26,935 refund awarded to Madden on that date was thereforerescinded. The DOE also determined that under the standards establishedin <T3>Total Petroleum Inc.,</T3> 17 DOE andpara; 85,542 (1988), Madden waseligible for a refund of $5,742 ($5,000 of principal and $742 of interest).<ITAG tagnum="84">Crude Oil End-Users </ITAG>The Office of Hearings and Appeals granted crude oil overcharge refundsto end-user applicants in the following Decision and Orders:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>5,L2,tp0,i1,s200,xls60,10,10,10</C> <H1>Name</H1><H1>Case No.</H1><H1>Date</H1><H1>No. of applicants</H1><H1>Refund</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Flasher Public School District et al.<D>RF272-9389</D><D>1/17/89</D><D>63</D><D>$23,950</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Greene County et al.<D>RF272-14322</D><D>1/18/89</D><D>83</D><D>27,455</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">John W.
