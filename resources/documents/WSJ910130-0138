In the year-earlier period, the bank holding companyearned $19.1 million, or 47 cents a share. The $115 millionloan-loss provision compared with a $108 million provisiontaken in the 1989 quarter.</LP><TEXT>   The fourth-quarter deficit didn't surprise analysts, whohad expected the bank holding company to post either a narrowloss or profit.   Jerome I. Baron, first vice president at Ryan, Beck andamp; Co.,a West Orange, N.J., securities firm specializing in bankstocks, said Midlantic was able to weather thelarger-than-expected provision because ofhigher-than-expected net interest income. &quot;The companybenefited from the rapidly declining cost of funds and asticky prime rate,&quot; he said.   For the full year, Midlantic had a loss of $195 million,or $5.22 a share, compared with net income of $206.3 million,or $5.27 a fully diluted share in 1989. Loan-loss provisionstotaled $694 million, compared with $190 million in 1989. Atyear end, the company's loan-loss reserves totaled $737million, or 65% of nonperforming loans, up from $388 millionat the end of 1989.   Midlantic said it took significant steps in 1990 torestructure its balance sheet and improve liquidity byselling about $1 billion in assets and adding more than $1.5billion in core deposits. At year end, Midlantic had assetsof $23.6 billion; deposits totaled $20.2 billion.   The company said its capital levels exceeded federalregulatory requirements and would even exceed the tougherstandards that go into effect at the end of 1992.   Midlantic operates in several states, principally NewJersey, New York and Pennsylvania. In nationalover-the-counter trading yesterday, its shares closed at$4.75, down 37.5 cents.</TEXT></DOC>
