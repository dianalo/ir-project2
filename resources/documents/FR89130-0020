Regulatory Analysis</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">I. Background</ITAG>EPA issued a proposed rule in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on June 21, 1988 (53 FR 23342), to clarify theintent of the regulatory language in 40 CFR 270.62(d). Specifically, theAgency wished to clarify that permit conditions for existing hazardouswaste incinerators must be based on pre-permit trial burn results underandSection;270.19(b) or other data submitted by the applicant as specifiedin andSection;270.19(c), unless the applicant is not required to conducta trial burn pursuant to an exemption under andSection;270.19(a). ``Incinerators''are defined in 40 CFR Part 260 as ``* * * any enclosed device using controlledflame combustion that neither meets the criteria for classification asa boiler nor is listed as an industrial furnace.''EPA promulgated andSection;270.19 on April 1, 1983 (48 FR 14239), to requirethat the Part B of a permit application for incinerators include one ofthe following: (1) Sufficient information submitted under andSection;270.19(a)to obtain an exemption from compliance with the performance standards inandSection;264.343 and the operating conditions in andSection;264.345; (2)a trial burn plan or the results of a trial burn under andSection;270.19(b),including all required determinations, in accordance with andSection;270.62;or (3) information in lieu of a trial burn under andSection;270.19(c) thatis sufficient to determine compliance with performance standards and developoperating conditions under andSection;andSection;264.343 and 264.345, respectively.In the proposal for this rulemaking, EPA stated its belief that andSection;270.19(a) and (c) are explicit as to what information is required prior to issuanceof a permit, but the Agency recognized that language in andSection;270.62(d)is potentially ambiguous as to what must be accomplished under andSection;270.19(b)prior to issuing a permit. Specifically, the Agency stated its concernthat a loose interpretation of andSection;270.62(d) might lead a RegionalAdministrator or State Director to set a date for submittal of trial burnafter the permit is issued. This strained interpretation of andSection;270.62(d)might lead one to think that permits can be written under andSection;270.19(b)based on the submission of a trial burn plan instead of the results ofthe trial burn, contrary to the intended meaning of andSection;270.62(d).Although the Agency is making this clarification to the actual languageof andSection;270.62(d) in a final rule, EPA believes that the intended meaningof andSection;270.62(d) has been clear since andSection;270.62(d) was promulgated.Today the Agency is promulgating final regulations identical to those proposed.The amendments to andSection;270.62(d) make it very clear that existing incinerationfacilities must (1) conduct a trial burn and submit the trial burn resultsprior to permit issuance, or (2) submit other information as specifiedin andSection;270.19 (a) or (c) before a permit can be written for that facility.Should a permit applicant submit trial burn results under andSection;270.19(b),permit conditions must be established using the trial burn results. Conversely,if the applicant submits other information under andSection;270.19 (a) or(c), the permit must be based on that information.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Response to Comments</ITAG>The Agency received only one comment, which requested that EPA clarifywhether this rule is applicable to permits that are already final. In responseto the commenter's concerns, EPA has decided that today's rule, which willbecome effective 30 days after final promulgation, is applicable only topending and future permit applications and permits. Accordingly, shoulda hazardous waste incinerator owner not have a final permit decision issuedas of the effective date of this rule or should a hazardous waste incineratorowner seek, after the effective date of this rule, a permit modificationwhich requires a trial burn, the incinerator will be subject to these requirements,i.e., the trial burn must be completed prior to permit issuance or permitmodification.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. State Authority</ITAG>A. Applicability of Rule in Authorized StatesUnder section 3006 of RCRA, EPA may authorize qualified States to administerand enforce the RCRA program within the State. (See 40 CFR Part 271 forthe standards and requirements for authorization.) Following authorization,EPA retains enforcement authority under sections 3008, 3013, and 7003 ofRCRA, although authorized States have primary enforcement responsibility.Prior to the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), a Statewith final authorization administered its hazardous waste program entirelyin lieu of EPA administering the Federal program in that State. The Federalrequirements no longer applied in the authorized State, and EPA could notissue permits for any facilities in the State that the State was authorizedto permit. When new, more stringent Federal requirements were promulgatedor enacted, the State was obliged to enact equivalent authority withinspecified time frames. New Federal requirements did not take effect inan authorized State until the State adopted the requirements as State law.In contrast, under section 3006(g) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6926(g), new requirementsand prohibitions imposed by HSWA take effect in authorized States at thesame time that they take effect in unauthorized States. EPA is directedto carry out those requirements and prohibitions in authorized States,including the issuance of permits, until the State is granted authorizationto do so. While States must still adopt HSWA-related provisions as Statelaw to retain final authorization, HSWA applies in authorized States inthe interim.B. Effect on State AuthorizationToday's rule promulgates clarifying regulations that will not be effectivein authorized States since the regulations will not be imposed pursuantto the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984. Thus, the regulationswill be effective only in those States that do not have final authorization.40 CFR 271.21(e)(2) requires States that have final authorization to modifytheir programs to reflect Federal program changes and to subsequently submitthe modification to EPA for approval. The deadline by which the State mustmodify its program to adopt this final regulation will be determined bytoday's date, in accordance with andSection;271.21(e). These deadlines canbe extended in certain cases (40 CFR 271.21(e)(3)). Once EPA approves themodification, the State requirements become Subtitle C RCRA requirements.States that submit their official application for final authorization lessthan 12 months after the effective date of these standards are not requiredto include standards equivalent to these standards in their application.However, the State must modify its program by the deadlines set forth inandSection;271.21(e). States that submit official applications for finalauthorization 12 months after the effective date of those standards mustinclude standards equivalent to these standards in their application. 40CFR 271.3 sets forth the requirements a State must meet when submittingits final authorization application.In authorized States, this rule will not be applicable until the Staterevises its program to adopt equivalent regulations under State law. However,because EPA is only clarifying current regulatory language, the Agencyassumes that these requirements are already in effect in most States and,therefore, a simplified application will be allowed for the program revisionnecessitated by this final rule. In order to maintain authorization, aState's revision application may consist of a certification by the StateAttorney General that he/she interprets his/her State's existing regulationsin the manner described in this rule. Otherwise, the State's regulationsmust be amended to reflect the clarification set forth in this rule. Ifa State Attorney General cannot certify that he/she interprets his/herState's existing regulations in the manner described in the rule or ifthe State fails to make necessary regulatory amendments, that State's programwill be less stringent than the Federal program and will be out of compliancewith the RCRA's requirements for authorized State programs.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Effective Date</ITAG>This final rule will be effective 30 days after promulgation. Section 3010(b)of RCRA provides that regulations concerning permits for the treatment,storage, or disposal of hazardous waste shall take effect six months afterthe date of promulgation. However, section 3010(b)(1) provides for a shorterperiod if the Agency finds that the regulated community does not need sixmonths to comply with the next regulation. Since this rule merely clarifiesa requirement that is already in effect and the regulated community shouldalready be in compliance, EPA believes that good cause exists to make thisrule effective less than six months after promulgation.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Regulatory Analysis</ITAG>A. Regulatory Impact AnalysisUnder Executive Order 12291, EPA must determine whether a regulation is``major'' and thus whether EPA must prepare and consider a Regulatory ImpactAnalysis in connection with the rule. Today's final rule clarifies existingrequirements and is not major because it will not result in an annual effecton the economy of $100 million or more, nor will it result in an increasein cost or prices to industry. There will be no adverse impact on the abilityof the U.S. based enterprise to compete with foreign based enterprisesin domestic or export markets. Therefore, the Agency does not believe aRegulatory Impact Analysis is required for today's rule. This final rulehas been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for reviewin accordance with Executive Order 12291.B. Regulatory Flexibility ActUnder the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.,</T3> at the time an agency publishes any proposed or finalrule, it must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that describesthe impact of the rule on small entities unless the Administrator certifiesthat the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities. Today's final rule merely clarifies a requirementthat is already in effect. It does not impose any additional requirementson or effect the compliance burdens of the regulated community. Therefore,pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 601(b), I certify that this regulation will not havea significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 270</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Hazardous waste, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements, Permit modification procedures, Waste treatment and disposal.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: January 19, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Lee M.
