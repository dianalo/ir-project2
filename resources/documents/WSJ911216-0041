According to the report, the government's 20-year effortto reduce ground-level ozone -- the prime ingredient in smog-- may have been misdirected. &quot;There's been a lack ofprogress in many areas of the country that's bothdisappointing and perplexing,&quot; said John Seinfeld, chairmanof a committee of scientists that prepared the report.</LP><TEXT>   As a result of scientific and technical deficiencies, thestudy said, policy makers have seriously underestimated theamount of volatile organic compounds in the atmosphere andgiven insufficient attention to controlling nitrogen oxide.Ozone is formed when volatile organic compounds and nitrogenoxide react together in sunlight.   Volatile organic compounds are produced mainly from motorvehicles, evaporating solvents, the chemical and oilindustries and vegetation. Nitrogen oxide comes from thecombustion of fossil fuel by motor vehicles and electricpower plants.   The report, scheduled for release this week, was madeavailable over the weekend after copies were leaked to thepress. The American Petroleum Institute and the Motor VehicleManufacturers Association provided some funding for thestudy, which was primarily financed by the EnvironmentalProtection Agency and the Energy Department.   The report was required under last year's revisions to thefederal clean air act, which hit hard at the oil and autoindustries. By suggesting that the nation's approach inattacking smog is flawed, the study could bolster industryefforts to fend off even tougher requirements.   Some states are considering whether to join California inrequiring far tougher controls on emissions on cars and fuelthan are required nationally.   &quot;Why are states going for the most expensive option thatwill produce the least gain in air quality?&quot; asked TerryYosie, a vice president at the API. &quot;We need a nationaldebate on the effectiveness of our ozone control policy.&quot;   Environmental groups disagreed vehemently, however. DavidHawkins, senior attorney at the Natural Resources DefenseCouncil, contended that the report shows the need for aredoubled attack against volatile organic compounds as wellas increased attention to nitrogen oxide.   Among the report's major findings are the following:   -- Volatile organic compounds emitted by trees and othervegetation play a bigger role in smog formation in some areasthan officials have recognized. In cities such as Atlanta,more volatile organic compounds are emitted by naturalvegetation than by human sources.   -- The undercounting of volatile organic compounds has ledto a miscalculation of the ratio of hydrocarbons to nitrogenoxides. This ratio is important in determining whichpollutant is more important to attack in reducing smog. As aresult, in some areas, officials have focused insufficientlyon nitrogen oxide.   -- The government's main method for measuring smog isfaulty, partly because it doesn't adequately take intoaccount fluctuating weather patterns.</TEXT></DOC>
