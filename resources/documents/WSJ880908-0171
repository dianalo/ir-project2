Taylor (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> GOVMT </CO><IN> BNK ERN </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   U.S. commercial banks rang up a robust $5.5 billion in earnings in the second quarter, boosting first-half net income to a record $10.5 billion, federal officials said.    The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said bank capital, return on equity and asset quality also increased in the first half, while bad assets and the number of problem banks declined.    FDIC Chairman William Seidman was delighted with the indicators. &quot;For the first time in a long time all of them are going in the right direction,&quot; he told reporters. He said 1988 would produce record bank profits if current trends continued, and 1989 is likely to be even better.    The second-quarter earnings figure contrasted with the $10.6 billion loss banks showed in last year's second period, when major banks set aside heavy reserves against Latin American debt. It improved on their first-quarter earnings of $5 billion, and was exceeded only by the record $5.8 billion earnings registered in the third quarter of last year.    Midwestern banks were gaining strength through June while those in the Southwest &quot;continue to suffer from severely depressed real estate markets,&quot; FDIC officials said. Texas banks had losses totaling $2.9 billion in the first half, $2.3 billion of that attributable to First RepublicBank Corp., Dallas, which was taken into receivership July 29 and is being run now by NCNB Corp., Charlotte, N.C. The Dallas bank isn't related to First Republic Bancorp. of San Francisco.    Nationally, banks' equity capital rose 7.3% in the year ending last June 30 as they prepared to meet tougher international capital standards. Capital rose to 6.15% of assets, the FDIC said.    Mr. Seidman's only concern was that banks' assets grew at only a 4.88% annual rate through the first half. He said that their growth should at least equal the economy's rate of expansion before adjustment for inflation, which he put at about 7%.    One explanation for the slow asset growth, however, is that banks are believed to be boosting their off-balance-sheet activities, such as selling securities backed by assets.    As competition for commercial lending has intensified, banks also have been increasing their investment in real estate and consumer lending. Real estate loans have grown to 34% of banks' lending, the FDIC said, from 25% in 1982. Conceding that real estate is volatile, Mr. Seidman said he didn't think the change was troublesome, but added, &quot;we'll have to follow it.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
