Lysate preparations from wheat germ, rabbitreticulocytes, and Chinese hamster lung cells, for use in translationof collagen mRNAs, have been described in detail. Since most investigatorsare no longer likely to prepare their own extracts for in vitro translation,we felt that a description of our small-scale adaptation of the commerciallyavailable systems might be useful to others. This article describes theprocedures used in the authors' laboratory for analysis of types I andII collagen mRNAs by translation of both purified (deproteinized) totalcellular RNAs and polysome-associated RNAs. They have particularly emphasizedthe precautions one must take in performing these assays and in interpretingthe data generated by them. The use of in vitro translation experimentsin examining the roles of transcriptional and posttranscriptional eventsin the control of collagen gene expression is discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
