Some retrograde gas rings settleinto tilted, warped, preferred planes. Prograde gas rings are disturbedin elongated prolate potentials, and some part of a gas ring concentratesin the galactic center. The time scale for gas to settle into the preferredplane is the time during which each part of a gas ring becomes woundup due to differential precession. If the potential of the polar ringgalaxy is spherically symmetric, the polar ring is stable. 36 references.</TEXT></DOC>
