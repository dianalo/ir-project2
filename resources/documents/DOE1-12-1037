By statisticalanalysis of the deformation of development roads due to rock stress,principles for the design of development roads in rock and coal couldbe derived for greater depth. Simple formulae allow prediction of theconvergence if rock type below the roadway is roughly known. From convergence,conclusions as to optimal cross section and support of the roadway canbe drawn. It is thought that development roadways in the Ruhr area canbe controlled even at depths of 1600 m by use of present technology includingdinting machines. 20 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
