Metallographicanalysis and x-ray diffraction revealed the presence of the magneticLa{sub 2}(Fe/sub 1-//sub x/Co/sub x/){sub 14}B phase in the La-basedmaterials; lattice parameters for x = 0--1 were determined. High-temperaturemagnetization measurements allowed the Curie temperature T/sub c/ tobe determined. The substitution of nonmagnetic La for Nd results in anearly constant decrease ({Delta}T/sub c/{approx_equal}40 K) in the orderingtemperature of these compounds, in contrast to the results of Y substitution.A molecular field analysis of the data shows that 3d-4f exchange is relativelyconstant with increasing Co substitution, while 3d-3d exchange increasessharply. These measurements are compared with results in Fe-rich La{sub15}(Fe/sub 1-//sub x/Mn/sub x/){sub 77}B{sub 8} and Nd{sub 15}(Fe/sub1-//sub x/Mn/sub x/){sub 77}B{sub 8}.</TEXT></DOC>
