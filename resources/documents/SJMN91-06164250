TO LOOK AT PLANS FOR EVERGREENUPSCALE COMMUNITY WOULD HOUSE 9,000  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     &quot;This is the largest, most detailed plan we've ever done for the city,&quot;said Councilwoman Pat Sausedo, whose district includes Evergreen. &quot;The biggestadvantage of doing such a plan is that both residents and City Hall know whatis going to be developed before it's developed.&quot;;    Bounded by Quimby Road,Evergreen Creek and Ruby Avenue, the undeveloped 865-acre parcel of land wouldinclude schools with bell towers, central green zones with fountains andobelisks, and a community center.;    About 3,000 residences ranging in sizefrom expansive hillside homes to small townhouses would house about 9,000people. Densities would range from 2 to 25 units per acre. For Gary Costa,that is too close for comfort.;    Costa owns property on a hillside that waszoned as a low-density area. He fears his land will lose value when theplanned high-density adjacent lots are developed.;    &quot;It looks like thisproject may go right through whether we like it or not,&quot; said Costa'sattorney, Raymond Castello.;    Others like Ed Normandy, a six-year Evergreenresident who works for the city human resources department, are concernedabout whether the development project would fit into their neighborhood.Normandy said the style of the design was very European and that he would haveliked it to reflect better the people who live in the area. &quot;It must includesomething that the whole community can celebrate,&quot; he said.;    The plan isthe brainchild of a group of 16 residents, school administrators, landownersand city administrators who have been meeting since March 1990 to come up witha development concept that would be as attractive and as well-received aspossible.;    The city council had designated the area as a residentialcommunity, with the condition that a specific plan would be prepared andadopted before the approval of any development in the area.; IF YOU'REINTERESTED; The San Jose City Council will discuss adoption of the EvergreenSpecific Plan at 7 p.m. today at the Council Chambers, 801 N.
