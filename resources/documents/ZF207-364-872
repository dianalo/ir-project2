IT WAS ONLY a few short years agothat vendors, especially those at the high end, were making it clear thatmixed pagination solutions--systems supplied by different vendors--weren't aviable alternative for large newspapers.andP;  System Integrators and Atexcertainly supported that philosophy, with the former's words and the latter'sactions proclaiming that pagination would only result from &quot;single suppliersolutions.&quot;andM;Most of us remember the tone set by the statement that a mixed solution wasakin to &quot;mixing dogs and cats.&quot;andP;  In many cases, vendors refused to link theirsystems with competitors' products.andP;  These vendors supported this philosophyby making a case for faster and better solutions if the vendor couldconcentrate on its own development, rather than spending time buildingbridges to other systems that would produce marginal benefits at best.andP;  Wewill want to readdress this rationale later--but first a word on what appearsto have changed.andM;The love-in.andP;  From the perspective of cooperation (which we have always feltwas one of the biggest stumbling blocks to pagination), this year's seminarwas referred to as a &quot;love-in.&quot;andP;  Several vendors and users spent as much timepraising the cooperation they were getting between vendors as they did indescribing the details of how systems would talk to each other.andM;This was a giant step forward, but we wouldn't have minded a little moredetail describing how systems supplied from different vendors were going tocommunicate.andP;  But at least the vendors appear to be speaking to each other.andM;All of this was started with the Baltimore Sun, which has decided to &quot;backend&quot; its large SII editorial and classified systems with equipment suppliedby Crosfield.andP;  Baltimore was obviously impressed with Crosfield's experiencein color (a recurring theme during the week), its now-solid display adsystem, and its long history in the news page makeup area (from itsacquisition of Hastech).andM;But as impressed as the Sun obviously is today with Crosfield's approach, webelieve it was SII's decision to withdraw from its complex &quot;total pagination&quot;effort, based on SII's Ring operating system, that really opened the door forthe competition.andP;  In fact, at the top end of this market we believe the doorswill have to be opened in this way for the competition to get a fair shot atthis business--regardless of the capabilities of their systems.andM;Now that the decision has been made, the time has come for implementation.andO;Baltimore praised the cooperation between Crosfield and SII, knowing howimportant this is.andP;  Without this cooperation a mixed system of this size isimpossible.andP;  But while praising the cooperation between Crosfield and SII,Baltimore's Jim McCrystal even took the time to praise the company that lostthe order: Atex.andP;  Just the fact that Atex bid on the project shows it beliefthat mixed solutions are possible.andP;  When questioned further on this point,Ben Smylie from Atex offered his full support for this multivendor approachto pagination and was eager to join the &quot;love-in.&quot;andM;But before we got too excited about high-end mixed solutions, Al Edwards fromSII interjected some sobering thoughts.andP;  He clarified SII's position oncooperation.andP;  SII will cooperate with its customers to tie their editorialand classified systems with other supplier's equipment, such as display adsystems, graphic subsystems and pagination products.andP;  However, it will dothis only through a set of standards that it believes the industry is movingtoward--such as PostScript, OS/2 and Ethernet.andP;  further, even with theserestrictions, SII believes that mixed-vendor solutions inevitably willcontain compromises that customers will have to deal with.andM;To summarize what we heard:andM;* Cooperation is now possible between vendors; they are willing to talk toeach other about building pagination systems with components from differentvendors.andM;* Much of this will take place via the use of standards, reducing the timecompeting vendors will have to spend on integration of multivendor productsrather than on their own development.andM;* This is not a panacea.andP;  It may force us to accept some compromises in thepagination solutions.andP;  But &quot;single-vendor solutions&quot; aren't a panace eitherand present their own set of problems, a situation that usually results in atrade-off between better point solutions and closer integration.andM;* With the exception of a couple of pioneers, the high end of the newspapermarket is still not ready for independent system suppliers that would buildsystems from the best available point solution products.andP;  For the moment,users remain closely tied to their front-end editorial/classified vendors.andO;It is not clear how soon independent system suppliers similar to those nowselling to the lower-end newspapers and manazines are likely to emerge forthis market.andM;What's Happening?andP;  With those general comments behind us, let us turn to thespecific Seminar presentations and discussions.andM;We were particularly anxious this year to look at what is happening atpioneering newspapers and magazines currently involved in implementing newpagination systems.andP;  Newspapers as diverse as the Baltimore Sun, BostonGlobe, Houston Chronicle, Rheinische Post, and Chicago Tribune are spendingmillions of dollars on ambitious new systems.andP;  Others are taking much lessgrandiose, step-at-a-time approaches.andP;  Some, like Boston and Baltimore, arerelying on traditional systems vendors to provide solutions for them.andO;Others, like the London Evening Standard and Tabloid Newspapers in Boston,are serving as their own integrators.andP;  And on the magazine front, more andmore &quot;customers&quot; are striking out on their own to assemble what their systemvendors cannot or will not supply to them.andM;To start the session, we selected four large newspapers who are currentlyinstalling ambitious pagination systems.andP;  Because we have had some difficultyin separate conversations with the nespapers and their vendors figuring outexactly what is going on, we invited these newspapers and their systemvendors to make joint presentations.andM;These presentations were then followed by separate presentations from avariety of newspapers and magazines--interspersed with comments from a coupleof vendors who feel strongly about particular topics.andM;First, the joint newspaper/vendor presentations.andM;Atex/BostonandM;The Boston Globe is the beta site for Atex's full pagination system(Publication Production Node, or PPN) and comes closest to what mostnewspapers view as a single-vendor solution.andP;  Unquestionably, the Globe'ssystem will incorporate products from many other vendors besides Atex.andP;  ButAtex is supplying both the front end of the equation (classic editorial andclassified systems as well as ad order taking for all advertising) and thepagination and integration portions of the system.andP;  In other words, if weview it from a traditional monochrome production standpoint, Atex issupplying everything except the display ad system and the typesetters.andM;It has been evident for some time the Glove would be satisfied only with apagination solution that closely integrates everything--not only theeditorial, advertising and production functions, but many other aspects ofthe business.andP;  It clearly is at one extreme on the spectrum when it comes todefining pagination/integration.andP;  At the other end of the spectrum would betotal, back-end pagination solutions: those that provide only a loosecoupling with the editorial system, as is typical in many smaller andmedium-sized papers.andM;Managing the process.andP;  Steve Taylor of the Glove assured us that the dream offull pagination is &quot;still alive.&quot;andP;  And as we mentioned above, for him this means managing the process (keeping track of every page element and page flowitself--managing the data about the data) as much as managing the productiontask.andP;  He will not be satisfied with pagination if all it does is eliminaterazor blades and wax on the paste-up tables.andM;He painted a very complex picture of all the systems that have to beintegrated, with Atex at the hub.andP;  As for status, he now believes that theconcept has been proved and the next step is to turn this concept into aproductive reality.andP;  The Globe has a goal of completing the installation andmoving into sustained  production during 1989.andP;  Subsystems such as classifiedpagination will begin to go live soon.andM;This schedule is consistent with the one presented by Atex, which calls for ageneral release of the product by the end of 1989.andP;  Atex also stated itscontinued commitment to its older, proprietary J-II systems as well as theaddition of more fourth-wave components.andP;  It said it would begin to sellfull, fourth-wave solutions (with no J-11s) for some market segments foreditorial applications.andM;The price.andP;  None of this comes for free.andP;  This level of complexity--somethingAtex referred to as &quot;nuclear strength publishing&quot; (as opposed toindustrial-strength publishing, which was the title of a seminar sectiondevoted to distinguishing segments of the professional market that can't usedesktop  programs), will cost more than many newspapers are willing to pay.andO;Atex and the Glove both believe that an increasing number of newspapers arenow willing to pay for this all-encompassing, sophisticated integration.andO;Without being specific, they both supported the notion that majormetropolitan papers won't be able to support significant increase in pagecount (which will be a likely result from zoning) without increases in staff.andO;They feel that this level of integration is required to address that problemadequately.andP;  In addition, they anticipate savings in other areas such asservices--all beyond the savings we customarily expect from pagination.andM;Crosfield/BaltimoreandM;Other speakers, such as System Integrators' Al Edwards, didn't agree.andP;  Al'sexperience in selling large complex systems to U.S.andP;  papers doesn't supportthe theory that there are many large metros willing to put up the kind ofmoney (somewhere in the vicinity of $15 million) that the Globe is spending,not because they don't believe that &quot;integrating the process&quot; is important,but because they believe that smaller investments in specific portions of thepagination task will provide better incremental benefits.andP;  To that end SIIhas decided to approach pagination as a sequence of modules with commitmentsto only a few at a time (with the plan on total integration of these modulesas they are developed--not all at oncee.andM;The Baltimore/Crosfield and Houston/Camex installations also address thisquestion of &quot;is the customer ready to spend what totally integratedpagination really costs?&quot;andP;  These are two examples of U.S.andP;  metros that appearto support the Atex/Globe contention (not necessarily the dollar amount, butthe concept).andP;  The big difference appears to be in the timing of theinstallation and method of purchase.andP;  These papers are breaking the processinto smaller phases and will purchase later phases based on the success ofproven ones.andM;Jim McCrystal of the Baltimore Sun was on hand to provide a rundown of hispagination plans and the phasing of the project.andP;  He was supported by GrahamShaw of Crosfield.andP;  (See page 3 for a system diagram.)andM;Baltimore is also looking for a fully integrated solution to pagination.andO;Based on the system the Sun purchased and on the type of interfacing that isunder development with SII, we don't think this system will have the samedegree of management information as the Globe system.andP;  This doesn't implythat the system won't manage the process.andP;  In fact, it is being designedspecifically to manage the make-up of the entire newspaper (including fullcolor), but not much beyond that.andP;  The Globe, on the other hand, will bringin many other aspects of the newspaper, including many administrativeservices.andP;  Both of these newspapers want (and eventually will get) managementcontrol, but in some cases they are focusing on different portions of theoverall process of producing and delivering the newspaper product.andM;Control center.andP;  Like Atex, Crosfield will supply Baltimore with a controlcenter: a page element database that it calls PICS, for Page Information andControl System.andP;  This will manage the information about the data.andP;  It doesn'treplace the text and image databases; it is a layer above them, which keepstrack of the location and status of all the data elements on every page.andM;Color was a key part of the decision to go with Crosfield.andP;  Baltimore wantedcolor to be an integral part of the system, not an adjunct to it.andP;  It doesn'tsee a fast payback for the project or for color specifically, but it has madea full commitment to it.andM;Another key to the decision was the use of standards.andP;  Baltimore felt thatCrosfield was committed to using standard components wherever possible andwill be offering off-the-shelf terminals for making up both display ads andpages.andP;  It was also pleased with Crosfield's use of both PCs and Macs.andM;Crosfield equipment will interface also with several existing systems.andP;  Forbilling and retail ad orders, it will be tied to Admarc running on an IBMmainframe.andP;  The Crosfield Vaxes will be tied also to SII's Tandem computersfor integration with editorial and classified data.andP;  Calssified display adscan be sent to the SII system for total classified pagination (Baltimore isalready paginating the classified liner ads).andP;  Text originating on the SIIeditorial system will be sent via this link to Crosfield for pagination.andM;The SII system.andP;  Baltimore made it clear that it isn't giving up on its SIIeditorial system.andP;  It will use it for more than just an expensive wordprocessor.andP;  It will compose text using SII's Style facilities on the SIIsystem.andP;  The composed text will be sent to Crosfield, where it will berecomposed (!) and placed onto pages.andP;  Baltimore believes it can achievesimilar line endings and depths with these two very different compositionpackages.andM;In this scenario, the SII system will be used to compose to fit, but finalprecise fitting will be done on the Crosfield side.andM;Standards.andP;  Crosfield agreed to the use of many standards beyond just majorhardware components to make the system work effectively.andP;  On key to this isthe plan to use PostScript for both input and output.andP;  PostScript filesoriginating outside the system will be incorporated with Crosfield-generatedpages using PostScript (as well as other standards such as TIFF and PICT).andO;Final pages will be sent to output devices in PostScript format.andP;  Crosfieldis evaluating the performance of PostScript and believes the current speedlimitations can be overcome.andM;Besides standards, Crosfield believes its biggest contribution to Baltimore(or any other paper looking for an integrated solution) is the databaseitself.andP;  It believes a page-element database is a must and the ability tomanage huge color and black-and-white images is a key to its future.andP;  It wasclear from the presentation that Crosfield believes this is a real strengthit can provide.andM;Phases.andP;  As we mentioned above, Baltimore is implementing this in fourphases, starting with ad and page make-up.andP;  Other phases include color designand placement using high-resolution color images in phase 2.andP;  Facsimile(local and remote) is added in phase 3, and editorial design, production andinformation control in the final phase.andP;  Phases 1 andamp; 3 are currently beingcontracted for.andM;Digital Technology/LondonandM;Allan Marshall is another SII customer who has contracted with a paginationvendor to integrate various systems for his paper, the Evening Standard inLondon.andP;  The Standard is a very large UK metro with a circulation of morethan one-half million, a 150-terminal SII system and 160 terminals from PressComputer Systems of the UK.andP;  It has added 20 PCs to the SII system and has 24Macs in place.andM;Besides this, the Standard is bringing a lot of its own innovation andintegration into the process.andP;  It had no way of interfacing its Macs andPostScript programs into the APS-6 typesetters.andP;  Rather than waiting forAutologic to build a special interface (or develop and/or implementPostScrip), the Standard had Hyphen interface its high-speed, high-resolutionPostScript RIP to the APS-6 recorders, in essence creating a full PostScripttypesetter.andP;  Currently these machines are typesetting full tabloid pages,including graphics, in about 7 minutes per page.andP;  One of the majorbottlenecks is the interface to the RIP, which is Apple's LocalTalk.andP;  AnEthernet addition to the RIP in about four weeks should bring the anticipatedtypesetting time down to 5-1/2 minutes per page.andM;The Standard (as well as many other papers) believes a key to solving theoutput speeds using PostScript is compression of graphic files.andP;  It hasworked with its suppliers to develop compression techniques for line art andhalftone files that will make both transmission and typesetting ofhigh-resolution images viable.andP;  IT believes that typesetting speeds of 2-1/2minutes per page (including full text, ads and graphics) should be possibleby the end of this year.andP;  This additional time savings (if achievede will besolved by addressing the transmission of graphics in compressed formats.andP;  Wewonder, though, if this doesn't amount to a deviation from the PostScriptstandard.andM;Pagination software.andP;  Besides using the Digital Technology AdSpeed (formerlyAdBuilder) to build display ads, the Evening Standard is using page make-upsoftware from Digital Technology for total pagination.andP;  In contrast to theother vendors we mentioned above, the Standard is focusing much more onsolving quickly the task of production of full pages of text, ads adsgraphics.andP;  When the system is completed, it will use 24 Mac terminals tobuild pages.andM;Text for these pages will originate on the SII system.andP;  Rough copy fittingwill take place there and be sent to the Digital Technology system for finalcopy fitting on the Macs.andP;  A two-way interface is planned with SII, whichwill also allow SII to be used for archiving editorial matter.andM;To date, the Evening Standard hasn't reached a full agreement with theeditorial department to allow pagination of the entire newspaper.andP;  Itcurrently is producing about 10 to 16 page with full text, ads and graphicsin place.andP;  With this much progress, the company has achieved a savings ofabout 10 minutes per page compared with composing text on the SII system andpasting it up conventionally.andM;Classified and wire services.andP;  The Standard is working also with the Swedishfirm Tele-Ekonomi on two related projects.andP;  It would like to use ClassBuilderon the Macs.andP;  But this will require converting classified ads, which are inthe Press Computer format, to an Apple Mac format.andP;  Tele-Ekonomi is helpingwith this task.andP;  The Standard would like also to use the Tele-Ekonomi picturewire service and develop a picture library system with the help of DPSTypecraft, the UK supplier of the Digital Technology equipment.andM;The Standard is good example of users working with their vendors on solutionsto complex problems.andP;  It could be viewed as its own integrator, but this ishardly a paper that is building its own system.andP;  Much of the work is beingdone by its suppliers.andP;  But nothing is done without the Standard being in themiddle of the project.andP;  In this way it is clearly in charge of its own fate.andM;Components.andP;  Digital Technology is very supportive of this concept.andP;  It isdoing a good deal of the integration and providing the hooks for otherpackages to be tied in.andP;  It is committed to using many desktop components(such as the Mac II), but is building professional systems around thesecomponents.andP;  At the seminar, Digital Technology announced a decision toinclude Novell and DEC as a means to increase the size and performance of itsdatabases.andP;  Like many of the other firms we have talked to recently, DigitalTechnology is revamping its editorial system strategy around an SQL database,which should be ready in about 90 days.andM;With this development, the company showed an upward movement into largernewspapers.andP;  As its president, Don Oldham, put it, &quot;There are those who makethe waves, those who ride the waves, and those who sit by watching the wavesdrown them.&quot;andP;  He clearly wants to be one of the companies creating waves forothers to ride.andM;Information International/JacksonvilleandM;Bob Martn, from The Florida Times-Union in Jacksonville, and Gary Nofrey fromInformation International teamed up to provide an update on the integrationof the large &quot;all-PC&quot; Morris system (about 270 terminals in all).andM;Jacksonville visited a lot of papers to study the good and the bad associatedwith current implementations of pagination.andP;  It wanted a seamless integrationbetween the front-end editorial and classified systems and the back-endpagination device.andP;  It felt that going to the vendor that now controls bothof these entities would be appropriate.andP;  In this way, it parallels the Globein looking for a single-vendor solution to the pagination/front-end question.andM;One of our interests has been to see if Triple-I's traditional approach topagination may have changed, now that it has the marketing rights to afront-end system (Morris).andP;  But the Jacksonville configuration currently isquite similar in this respect to other Triple-I pagination sites where thesystem is back-ending foreign front-end systems such as CSI, SII and Atex.andO;As Jacksonville pointed out, the system is still a one-way transfer from theMorris system to the Triple-I pagination device.andP;  The TECS/2 (Morris) system&quot;treats Triple-I as a slave typesetter.&quot;andP;  All composition is done on thefront-end, not on the pagination terminal.andP;  All editing and compositioncorrections are still done on the Morris system.andP;  In order to make thesechanges, Jacksonville has a Morris terminal beside every pagination terminal.andO;The pagination terminal is used primarily to lay out pages and place elementson them.andP;  Editing and corrections are done on the TECS/2 PC.andM;Jacksonville made it clear that it wanted a more creative tool, not anexpensive, electronic Exacto knife.andP;  Many people will contend that thecurrent implementation as described is still more of an electronic knife thanJacksonville stated it wants.andP;  The two-way interface which would likely makethis approach more creative (by possibly passing layout information inelectronic form to the Morris system) and provide composition on thepagination system (which could deal with last-minute corrections and latereditions) was not acknowledged as a project or given a fixed date.andP;  (Note,however, the progress Triple-I has made in providing a two-way interface withthe PC-based Editor's Page Planner, demonstrated at the Seminars and reportedbelow.)andM;MagazinesandM;The magazine side of the business seemed to be moving more rapidly to the useof fourth-wave systems (and components), from the very small to the verylarge.andP;  Mike McDonald was on hand to make a few announcements about what PPIis doing as a company and what moves it is making to take advantage of thenew technology.andM;Applied Graphics.andP;  First, PPI (Publishers Phototype International) has beenmerged with Kordet to form a new company called Applied Graphics.andP;  AppliedGraphics now operates full-service electronic prepress centers around thecountry.andP;  This includes typesetting, color separations, ad agency services,and transmission services to major printing sites around the world.andM;Much of what Mike talked about sounded as if he and his company were gettinginto the system integration business.andP;  Not so!andP;  He emphasized that thecompany will remain a &quot;service&quot; organization.andP;  However, he will share hisintegration experience in assembling fourth-wave system components and sellthese complete networked, desktop systems to their prepress clients.andM;One of these integration projects is the building of a system largelycomposed of PCs running XyWrite connected to a database.andP;  Also running on thesystem is Archetype page layout and composition software for making upmagazine pages (and other individual components such as display ads).andM;Mike appreciates the power of some of the desktop tools.andP;  In fact, that isone of the reasons he is assembling his own system rather than waiting forthe traditional suppliers to build the same type of system for him.andP;  He madeit clear that as long as people are realistic in their expectations ofdesktop publishing components, these tools can be valuable.andP;  As an example,he showed a rather &quot;high-end&quot; application--the design of the cover of US Newsandamp; World Report--which was created on a Mac using Aldus Freechand at a remotesite.andP;  The file was  transmitted to another Mac for the addition of type andlogos.andP;  Color separations were output on a Linotronic 300 via PostScript.andO;Applied Graphics isn't using the Linotronic 300 for most of its remotetransmission.andP;  Many parts of the page are not available in paginatedelectronic form.andP;  It is therefore continuing the use of facsimile machines totransmit magazines around the world.andM;Mike's message was clear.andP;  He recognizes the technological revolution, theconfusion it has caused, the likely fallout for some vendors, and theopportunities for others.andP;  Like many of us, he doesn't feel he has all theanswers, but a few things are clear.andP;  &quot;Desktop publishing is now a reality,and more and more publishers are taking direct control of their magazine'sprepress activities through the use of microcomputer-based technology.&quot;andO;PostScript is also a reality, he said.andP;  His advice is basically to &quot;getsomeone on your staff to learn this stuff,&quot; and to be careful not to automatesolely for automation's sake.andM;Time Inc.andP;  Bob McGoff from Time Inc. echoed many of these thoughts, but froma different perspective.andP;  By building a system to aid in the placement andcontrol of advertisements on magazine pages, Time clearly is taking morecontrol of its destiny.andP;  Bob painted a scenario of how ads and editorial textare reconciled in the manual process, and how he applied the principles of&quot;prototyping&quot; to explore ideas of how the process could be automated.andP;  Heused desktop components like the Mac II and software packages like MacApp(Apple's Pascal-based object-oriented toolbox), Macintosh ProgrammersWorkshop (Apple's Unix-like programming environment), Foxbase/Mac and Nexpert(an expert system) to connect into Time's mainframe to access to advertisingdatabase that is provided by Admarc.andM;He stressed the value of magazines getting involved in solving their ownproblems and stated that the concept of &quot;prototyping&quot; works.andP;  His focus wasnot on saving or eliminating people, but rather on making them moreproductive.andP;  The road isn't easy, he warned, citing the threat of vaporware,but he seemed pleased with what Time has accomplished in providing a modelfor automatic placement of ads.andM;Conclusion.andP;  Both Mike and Bob seem convinced that there is a place in thehigh-end magazine world for &quot;some&quot; desktop components.andP;  The problem has beeninstallation and support: Who is the integrator?andP;  Are the tools appropriatefor these high-end applications?andM;Our conclusions after hearing a week of pros and cons on the issue is thatthere is a place for desktop hardware and software components, even at thehighest levels of professional publishing, but the answer isn't universal; itdoesn't apply to everyone.andP;  The key appears to be, as Mike clearly pointedout, for users to get involved (as Bob did at Time), get their feet wet, testthe waters before diving into the pool.andP;  Get someone in the organization totake the time to learn what is available, what fourth-wave technology canrealistically do for a publication.andP;  But don't automate for automation'ssake.andM;With a few exceptions (mainly coming from the high end of the newspapermarket), there appeared to be a consensus for the first time that across mostvertical markets, from the very low end to the very high end (professionalpublishing), desktop components, coupled with complementary professionalprograms, can address many of our needs.andM;Quark crosses boundaries.andP;  This raises the question of software crossing theboundaries from the desktop to the  professional level.andP;  We asked FredEbrahimi, president of Quark, to comment on how a desktop package can providehigh-end functionality (and quality composition).andP;  The flavor of Fred'sopening comments were not surprising.andP;  He stated that &quot;Desktop publishing isbringing excitement to the land of dinosaurs.&quot;andP;  He wants to change thetraditions that have separated the creative design process from theproduction tasks.andP;  He also said he is committed to layout-driven pagination(which is the approach demanded by the very high-end applications).andM;He said his company is committed to providing the layout, the pagination andthe composition to tie into professional front-end editorial systems, as wellas high-end color systems (as he has done with Scitex).andP;  He understands thatsome desktop solutions don't provide enough quality today, but contends thatthe better desktop publishing packages are now reaching the level of qualityof previous traditional systems, and sometimes exceeding them.andM;Quark wants to be part of the high end as well as the desktop side of thebusiness.andP;  But neither Quark, nor any other desktop company, is willing toinvest the development effort to tailor its product to narrow verticalmarkets.andM;What's the solution?andP;  Quark believes it's through product extensions thatallow third-party vendors (and/or users) to take a standard Quark product andcustomize it for a specific application.andP;  An example of this effort wasexplained by Richard Cichelli from Software Consulting Services.andP;  Richard hastaken the Quark program, and, with the hooks provided by Quark, provides afull integrated version of Quark with his Layout 8000 package.andP;  Therefore,someone who wishes to use Quark Xpress for layout and pagination can beingwith page dummies that already have ads placed on them via the Layout 8000program.andP;  According to Richard, all the work was done by SCS, using thestandard extenions and hooks provided by Quark.andP;  (An effort by The ElectronicPublisher to use Quark Xtensions in its pagination effort was demonstrated atthe show and is described briefly in the equipment section below.)andM;The bottom line.andP;  In putting the entire discussion in respective, we are leftwith these comments:andM;(1) Desktop publishing programs are not likely to be highly customized by theoriginating desktop vendor for each narrow vertical market.andP;  (2) Desktopprograms are going to open up, providing hooks to allow third-partydevelopers and users to get into the program to make the necessary modifications--in effect customizing the program to specific needs.andP;  (3)Third-pary programmers are already recognizing this fact and beginning totailor desktop programs to professional needs.andP;  (4) Using desktop publishingas a base, with complementary functionality provided by third-party vendors,off-the shelf solutions will take another step forward in addressing high-endprofessional requirements.andP;  (5) It's too early to tell exactly what &quot;degree&quot;this will work for many applications.andP;  (For example, will a company like SIIbe able to modify the composition within Quark to match SII's Stylefacility?)andM;A variety of experiencesandM;Support for the use of desktop components in a fourth-wave system environmentwas evident everywhere, across virtually the entire spectrum.andP;  Hans-DieterBaumgart from the Rheinische Post in Germany, Garrett Queen from TabloidNewspapers in Boston, and Bill Brooks from the Vincennes Sun-Commercial inIndiana all echoed the same theme, although their systems vary greatly.andM;Rheinische Post is building a fourth-wave, fully integrated prepress systemto address the problem of printing 56 different daily newspaper editions infour locations.andP;  By 1990, his system will be producing the paper usingstandard hardware and software, uniform use interfaces and completeintegration with the host system.andM;The system will be handling a large number of different application programsrunning on the same PS/2 workstations under Presentation Manager.andP;  Up to 58different local area networks (token ring) will be tied together toaccomodates more than 1,000 terminals that will eventually be part of thesystem.andP;  Full page planning (including color) will be accommodated with thesystem.andM;What supprised many people at the seminar was the fact that the system willuse a large IBM 3090-200E mainframe as the file serve.andP;  The databased on thesyste will be DB2.andP;  But despite the fact that a mainframe is at the center,for the most part this is still a large, fourth-waves system.andP;  (Obviously itis being installed and integrated by a large system vendor, IBM withapplicaition software being provided by a variety of sources, including AlfaSystem Pactner in Germany.)andM;It will use as many standards as possible, with off-the-shelf PCs forterminals and a common user interface for all applications.andP;  Most of theapplication processing will take place within the terminals.andP;  And most ofall, the system is open to accommodates new programs as they are madeavailable for OS/2 and Presentation Manager.andM;The otter end.andP;  At the other end of the speciatum other fourth-waveproponents, and both of whose acted as their own integrators for most oftheir systems.andP;  Both Tabloid Newspapers papers and the Vincennes paper arelargely Macintosh based.andP;  Both incorporate a variety of software packages andperipherals.andP;  For example, Bill Brooks, publisher of the Indianan paper,found a wire service capture module and, with a little help from thedeveloper, integrated it with his system.andM;The 160,000--circulation weekly Tab Newspapers in Boston is doing 1600 pagesper week for 14 different papers to the all Doing 1600 pages per weeks for 14different paper on the all-fac system, including four-color work in tismagazing product.andP;  Garratt gave us a play-by-play description of how thesystem went together.andP;  The bottom line was to prove that Eddy Shah was rightwhen he said that &quot;you don't need the Big Solution from the Big Vendor&quot; topublish newspapers.andP;  Tab saw an opportunity that, for it, &quot;produces a betterproduct in less time, saves labor and expenses and creates a more interestingproductive environment in which to work.&quot;andM;In his summary, Garrett pointed out that the system meets and exceeds hisexpectations; it brings the production process closer to the editors, salesstaff and artists; it has proven to be cost effective; and it will growgracefully as the requirements grow.andM;We think he has hit on the critical aspect of the decision: it meets hisneeds.andP;  The system built by Tab (or Vincennes) is not the system foreveryone.andP;  But these are real, high-volume professional publications,produced mainly using off-the-shelf components.andP;  For the most part, thesystems are built, and the components integrated, by the user.andP;  The bestadvice is to evaluate the specific requirements and abilities, rather thanrely on what's best for other users or vendors.andM;Making a profit.andP;  Bill Brooks made many of the same points as Garrett.andP;  Heemphasized the simple fact that he is producing a newspaper to make a profit.andO;He is using Macs throughout his operation, with Digital Technology's AdSpeedfor display ads and ReadySetGo for page make-up.andP;  He has put the technologyto work in different ways, like having sales staff make up ads.andM;One of the key points that both of these Mac-based users talked about--apoint we haven't heard as a recurring theme before--was the fact that thistechnology has made the task of producing a newspaper more fun.andP;  Using thenew tools is more fun than the former manual way.andM;Mixing third and fourth waves.andP;  Both of these relatively simple operationsare in contrast to the &quot;industrial strength&quot; installation at the Independentin London.andP;  Steve Conaway from the Independent gave an in-depth view of thegood and bad, the cheers and the pain of being your own integrator.andP;  In hiscase it was much more than the connections of Macs and file servers.andM;The Independent is a mixture of the old and the new.andP;  It is a combination ofproven, third-wave systems from Atex and Scitex with new fourth-wavecomponents such as XyWrite running on PCs, Quark doing layouts on Macs, andthe connections of Sun--all on a user-installed Ethernet Link.andM;Why do it yourself?andP;  Steve had a black-and-white answer to the dilemma.andP;  Hedidn't feel that the total Mac or desktop publishing solution would handleall of his needs, and his company didn't have the &quot;deep pockets&quot; to pay whatthe system vendors were asking for.andP;  (In this regard, he echoed what AlEdwards was saying--few newspapers are willing to spend what Boston andBaltimore decided to shell out.)andM;He used XyWrite as an example of the problem.andP;  He originally went to hissystem vendor (Atex) to provide XyWrite for his PCs.andP;  But when he realizedthe price difference between buying it from Atex and buying it from retailchannels and installing it himself, he opted to continue down the path as hisow  system integrator.andM;Steve have praise for the functionality of his Atex and Scitex systems.andP;  Infact, we got the feeling that if price weren't an issue, and if those vendorshad moved more rapidly to take advantage of newer technology, he would haveopted to follow them for the expansion of his system, instead of doing muchof it himself.andM;Doing it himself was no picnic, either.andP;  Although he is using &quot;standards,&quot; hedoesn't believe that we really have any true standards.andP;  One of the biggestlimitations he faces as his own integrator is a real database, a reasonablesize unit with good network database management facilities.andP;  For him the Macdoesn't serve this need.andP;  This was a point Steuart Dewar emphasized in histalk.andP;  Like many others during the week, Dewar pointed out that the key topagination--the integration of high-resolution graphics and other componentson a page--is not the layout and manipulation on a screen (although that isimportant too), but a comprehensive and flexible database.andP;  Dewar is relyingon the SQL query language (the de facto standard for the new generation ofdatabase programs).andP;  He expects that this will allow him pull togetherinformation originating in many different formats and on many differentdevices.andM;Conaway is making good use of his Hyphen PostScript RIP.andP;  But here too hesees the shortcomings of this page description language (like the quality ofhalftones and the fact that there is no one PostScript standard).andP;  Hesuggested bringing about an industry-agreed PostScript standard.andP;  However, hetoo is a convert and accepts PostScript for what it is today.andM;Solving PostScript.andP;  Dewar sees PostScript in a little more positive light.andO;Although he acknowledges the faults in PostScript, he sees the problems astotally solvable.andP;  In addition, with no universal composition language inexistence, PostScript could be viewed as an aid for integration.andP;  Dewar feelsthat the biggest problem with PostScript being accepted universally today isits speed.andP;  To solve this he feels that three areas have to be addressed: (1)Compressing graphics (the beginnings of which are occurring at the EveningStandard in London).andP;  (2) Pre-compiling the PostScript files.andP;  (3) Scalingthe fonts using parallel processors.andM;All of the these are solvable--especially if we add a bit of hardware to theequation.andP;  Taken one step further, Dewar feels that display PostScript couldsolve the need for a single imaging model for screen and output.andM;Graphics were another area where Conaway felt that more work was needed.andP;  Heis paginating his paper, but graphics are still not fully integrated.andP;  Thosegraphics that are electronically incorporated are done blindly, by mergingthem at the typesetter using the familiar OD (output device) command.andP;  Thenext step involves improving graphics performance.andP;  He prefers Sunworkstations for the manipulation of graphics and is looking to FDDI to solvesome of the high-speed network problems associated with graphics.andM;It appeared that Steve, although his system varied greatly from the other&quot;user integrated&quot; systems, followed the same premise that the user has tolook at what the technology can do for the individual paper--that theefficiency, the productivity, and quality of the system is more importantthan just the question of whether the PC or Mac can perform a particularfunction.andP;  He stopped short of saying all users should be system integrators,but he showed through his own experience that even in a complex environmentit is possible.andM;Dewar addressed the same point and agreed that the single-vendor solution isonly one approach.andP;  He sees standards as an aid toward integration, in spiteof their shortcomings.andM;SII's stance.andP;  The formal presentations for the newspaper and magazinesessions were wrapped up by Al Edwards of SII, who took the opportunity todiscuss where SII stands.andP;  He preceded the talk with a brief &quot;state of thecompany&quot; summary.andP;  SII belongs to him and his management team.andP;  It cost a lotof money to go private (more than going public).andP;  Much of it was financedwith SII cash ($ 43 million in the bank at time of sale) and $ 15 million inproperty it owned.andM;But that is now history and the &quot;new&quot; SII is now focusing on the future.andP;  ToAl this means a company that is driven by the market (not the stockholders).andO;He feels the stockholders forced diversification, which was preventingproduct development and shipment in the newspaper arena.andP;  He has now movedall Randamp;D focus back to newspapers (away from the Ring project).andP;  He willleverage this Randamp;D by following standards (SII will use PS/2s, OS/2 and DOS,will move to Ethernet, Token Ring, and AppleTalk LANs, will gear outputaround PostScript and is looking at SQL database facilities).andP;  He is alsosticking to Tandems for file servers (and will continue to manufactureCoyotes for whoever wants them).andM;As for pagination, Edwards doesn't buy all the theory presented the previousday by his competitors and their users.andP;  He believes in pagination and heagrees, to a degree, with all the high-end concerns that page control isimportant and that the pagination system must provide this control.andP;  But hedoesn't see how this can happen with what he referred to as &quot;a back-endsolution.&quot;andP;  Although he didn't state it, this could only refer to theBaltimore Sun and Evening Standard installations where SII is providing thefront-end editorial system for pagination solutions provided by Crosfield andDTI respectively.andP;  The problem, as he sees it, is trying to keep two separatedatabases (front-end editorial and back-end pagination) synchronized.andM;But Al was very careful not to imply that he was favoring a return to thedays of dogs and cats.andP;  Instead he was trying to point out the differencesthat will inevitably occur with mixed solutions as opposed to single-vendorapproaches.andP;  He also feels that, although pagination is a necessity, thereisn't a market for pagination systems that will cost what &quot;some SIIcompetitors are charging for pagination.&quot;andP;  In other words, he feels the betasites that have put up big bucks for the Atex and Crosfield systems are not areflection of what the market is willing to spend, but reflect only what acouple of individual newspapers were willing to fund.andM;Panel discussionandM;We put together a panel of two large newspaper pioneers and a largeinnovative magazine publisher from Europe to take a pulse on where we aretoday and the status of their systems.andM;CText in Chicago.andP;  Dave Austin from the Chicago Tribune didn't get into thedetails of the system, but covered the status of where it is.andP;  He gave whathe considers a &quot;scary&quot; story of how this is a &quot;project that is really onschedule.&quot;andP;  If all goes well, Dave hopes to be running live with his CTextsystem, based on Tandem computers and PCs, by August.andP;  The only concern hecurrently has is with moving XyWrite under Presentation Manager andintegrating the New CText Tomahawk composition module.andP;  Everything else,including the full SQL database and wire services on the Tandems, is onschedule, he said.andM;He again stressed the benefits he sees from this architecture: an open systemthat can accommodate the wealth of DOS-based programs, commodity hardware andsupport, local training and an open architecture for integration of futures.andO;The lessons he has learned so far include that open systems (especially whenyou buy the Mercedes class of components) aren't cheap.andM;Camex in Houston.andP;  High prices were clearly the impression on the minds ofthe audience after listening to John Mercer from the Houston Chronicle.andP;  Johnpainted what appeared to be a gold-plated system with gobs of power andoverkill.andP;  He assured us that our impressions were flawed and the seeminglypricy system was more reasonable than we thought.andM;Why did we have such an impression?andP;  Houston is clearly taking Sun's word forit that &quot;the network is the system.&quot;andP;  A good deal of John's explanation ofthe system dealt with very fast, very powerful, and very redundant networks.andO;He is installing a dual fiber-optic network from Artel with a combinedtransfer rate of 100 megabits per second, or about 10 times the transfer rateof Ethernet.andP;  The dual network is a backup feature in case of breakage.andM;Why the speed?andP;  Houston wants to insure that any data, from anywhere in thesystem, can get where it has to go, during any deadline situation, withoutcause for worry.andP;  If the speed of the network is all we have to worry about,this one should accomplish that.andM;Houston is not exactly skimping on the workstations, either.andP;  It isinstalling eight Sun-4/280 file servers, each with 128 MB of RAM and 1.2-GBdrives.andP;  The initial system is installed for display ad work.andP;  They pulledthe plug on the old Raycomps (how many are left out there?) and installed 64Sun-3/60s, each with 8 MB of RAM and each with a 300-MB drive and 16&quot; colorscreens.andP;  The large number of terminals is partially due to the fact thatHouston is moving the advertising function out of production and directlyinto advertising.andP;  In addition, the terminals will be used for other taskssuch as spec art work and ad management.andM;The next step is classified.andP;  By late summer the classified portion of thesystem should be installed.andP;  This will link 200 Sun terminals to the Admarcsoftware on Houston's IBM 3081 mainframe.andP;  In order to maintain a singlerating structure and customer file (up-to-date payments etc.) on onecomputer, all rating and credit checking will be done centrally on the IBMmainframe.andP;  With this type of configuration, and the IBM mainframe doing mostof the classified work, we assumed that the Sun classified terminals will notbe as robust as the rest of the terminals in the system.andP;  However, Houstonnoted that classified operators may do simple display ads, and thereforethese terminals will have to have more &quot;display ad make-up&quot; functionality(and the workstation power this requires).andM;The editorial portion of the system is not scheduled to be installed until1990.andP;  This will add another 240 Sun terminals.andP;  If you start to add up whatChicago and Houston are spending on their new systems, you can appreciateDave Austin's comment that open systems aren't necessarily cheap.andM;Gutenberghus in Copenhagen.andP;  Eric Olsen from Gutenberghus in Copenhagenpainted a less exotic picture of pioneering but revealed many of the problemsjust the same.andP;  He described his very large Scitex complex, which producesmore than 25,000 pages of four-color magazines per year.andP;  He attributes thedrop in page make-up time from six hours per page from pre-Scitex times to3.7 hr./page today largely because of efficient use of available technology.andM;But Scitex is an expensive solution that can be complemented with lower-costworkstations (Macs in his case) for functions such as layout and, possibly,composition.andP;  His operation is much better suited to distributed magazinemake-up.andP;  But distributing Scitex Vista workstations to each magazine is veryexpensive, even compared to Scietex's own new Quark-based Visionary product.andO;There is a 4 to 8 times price differential between the two.andP;  So Eric hasdecided to add desktop publishing components to his operation--but notwithout a few headaches.andM;Some of the basic problems he sees with this solution is the fact thatcomposing and editing with Quark isn't quite up to the standard of moretraditional systems.andP;  But he sees this getting better.andM;The real problem, he claims, is in the fact that traditional vendors are tooslow in incorporating the needed hardware and software into their high-endsystems (a point made loud and clear during the newspaper bull session).andO;Another major problem Eric discovered along the way was the lack ofcompatibility between Quark Xpress (the shrink-wrapped version) and theScitex-supplied Visionary product.andP;  In fact, Visionary layout language is noteven compatible with Scitex's own Vista product.andP;  Obviously Scitex doesn'twant the desktop publishing packages cutting into its potential sales.andM;A perhaps bigger problem Olsen has with using Quark/Visionary is the factthat it doesn't have Danish handamp;j.andP;  (So much for the theory that Quark's hooksallowing people to get into the program will solve vertical market problems.andO;Isn't the Danish market a vertical market?)andP;  Solving this problem is probablyonly a matter of time, but it highlights some of the problems Europeans havewhen trying to use systems developed in the U.S.andM;But the biggest problem Gutenberghus has is in the difference in fonts;Visionary uses Bitstream fonts while Scitex's Texta RIP uses Linotype fonts,and the two don't match.andP;  Worse yet, Scitex's agreement with Linotypeprevents Scitex from using other fonts on the system.andM;This hasn't discouraged Eric in his long quest for using inexpensive desktopcomponents in conjunction with his high-end application needs.andP;  But hedoesn't want other people to make the same mistake he has, and he would liketo incorporate the real solutions other have found for similar applications.andM;Newspaper bull sessionandM;As usual, this year's bull session didn't lack emotion.andP;  About 200 braveattendees gave up a drink and early dinner to do battle.andP;  While the daysessions had been appropriately termed a &quot;love-in,&quot; the bull session wouldbest be described as &quot;the Friday night fights.&quot;andM;Dave Cole from the San Francisco Examiner got things rolling with somecriticism pointed at the traditional vendors for slow-paced (or non-existent)integration involving many of the readily available point solution productsavailable today.andP;  He used successes in his own magazine product, producedwith off-the-shelf hardware and software, as an example of certain jobs thatcan be done with desktop components.andM;It didn't take long for Baltimore (which had just spent more than a fewpennies for a high-end system) to criticize the Examiner, the Seyboldorganization, and everyone else who &quot;thinks desktop publishing systems aregoing to produce metropolitan U.S.andP;  newspapers.&quot;andP;  Using the example ofrotating a four-color photo on a Mac, Baltimore declared desktop publishingsolutions to be a joke for the task at hand.andM;It didn't take along to polarize the group with these two opening statements.andO;There was a plea from Atex to concentrate on the business issues and drop theuseless platform argument, but to no avail.andM;There was some truth in what both papers were saying, as well as thearguments supporting each view during the open discussion.andP;  But not much newground was covered.andP;  &quot;We still think there is a group of the upper-end U.S.andO;newspapers that will hold out for the large, expensive systems and continueto resist all the offerings emerging from the fourth-wave model andcomponents from the desktop world (these are two different issues).andM;It appears that most of the rest of the industry has bought into the theoryand is evaluating the situation for itself, as to what degree theselower-cost, standard components can help them.andP;  No one is convinced, norshould they be convinced, that large U.S.andP;  newspapers should be produced withdesktop publishing systems.andP;  But there are many fewer people today who willdeny that there are components, subsystems, and software packages that canprovide benefits in certain areas.andP;  Those who refuse to use these packagesuntil they are completely integrated with the rest of their systems arepossibly missing an opportunity.andP;  Everyone wants these packages to beintegrated, and they should.andP;  The question is not whether they can do part ofthe job, but whether we should use them as stand-alone packages in phase 1;whether we should pressure a system vendor to integrate them for us; orwhether we should integrate them partially ourselves.andM;The real loss, we believe, is to ignore them, not giving them a fairlook--not to see what they can do to make our jobs more efficient, moreproductive, and more competitive.andM;Magazine bull sessionandM;This year's Magazine bull session was a watershed event in that for the firsttime in recent memory Atex--living with it, building on it, or getting awayfrom it--wasn't the dominant topic of conversation.andP;  Why this was so says alot about how the market has changed since last year.andM;The people who were striving for a total solution that would evolve fromtheir Atex systems at last year's meeting were now contemplating a range ofchoices, of which Atex--itself in the midst of a transition to fourth waveplatforms and marketing strategies--is one choice among many.andP;  TheScitex-Quark agreement, the various Mac-based color design and layoutpackages (of which Atex is offering one alternative, its Design Software),the growth of networked Mac and PC-based publishing alternatives (theubiquitous XyWrite, now &quot;blessed&quot; by Atex due to its own Atex Writerincarnation of everyone's favorite text processor), and the growingsophistication of desktop publishing tools were all cited as alternatives nowin use or under active consideration.andM;Roger Black's Smart publication, produced using Mac and Quark Xpress,underscored the fact that the current generation of desktop publishing.andP;  Wecited Australian Consolidated Press in Sydney, which is providing its 20+titles using a 360 PC network running Novell NetWare, XyWrite, and VenturePublisher, as another example of the changing times.andP;  ACP had brieflyconsidered purchasing an Atex system, but decided it could build its ownsystem at a lower cost and with more control over how the system would bedesigned.andM;As have other publishers during the past year, magazine publishers nowrealize that they must take on a major part of the responsibility forintegrating their own system solutions.andP;  With the freedom of choice the newalternatives afford there comes the responsibility for integrating the piecestogether.andP;  Integration support from Atex and the other major vendors willstill be available--for a price.andP;  But there is also emerging a new breed ofintegrator--the VAR or other hired gun--who can also assist publishers toassemble their industry-standard building blocks into a system.andM;What's missing--besides the now shattered dream of a single, seamless, &quot;totalpublishing solution&quot;--are some of the copy management capabilities thatlong-time Atex users had grown extremely comfortable with and dependent upon.andO;Products such as Odesta's ODMS were generating considerable interest amonguser's looking for the missing production management piece to the desktopalternative.andP;  But generally the various constituencies represented in themeeting were still hoping that a &quot;shrink-wrapped PPN&quot; would appear on thescene before too long.andM;At which point in the session the &quot;new&quot; Atex offered to provide one--for aprice.andM;Newspaper and magazine equipmentandM;Newspaper and magazine publishers and system managers comprise a largeproportion of the Seminars attendes each year.andP;  As any Keynesian economistcan tell you, demand creates supply; therefore, the vendors who serve thesemarkets labor long and hard to prepare new &quot;goodies&quot; that will lure theattendees (read: buyers) onto the exhibit floor.andM;In this section, we will focus on software developments in the newspaper andmagazine markets: composition, layout, file routing, etc.andP;  Other items ofinterest to these publishers can be found elsewhere in this report.andP;  See page36 for coverage of output devices and fonts.andM;AtexandM;Atex demonstrated its new Macintosh-based Design Software product for layingout color pages of magazines and other publications, first shown at Folio'smagazine event last fall.andP;  The system is in operation at Newsday, in NewYork, where 16 Macs are running in standalone mode.andP;  It is outputting to aScitex system as well as supplying composition formats to an Atex system.andM;Atex said the schedule for supporting other Atex page layout programs callsfor MagPage to be addressed first, with PC PageMakeup following in three tosix months and News Layout in six to nine months.andP;  Interfaces to other colorsystems will be developed also.andM;Atex continues to work on enhancing the system prior to widespread salesefforts.andP;  At the Seminars, Atex showed a few new features since we had lastseen it.andP;  One of the key changes is the ability to bring text from the hostsystem and display it on the Mac.andP;  The idea is to provide betterrepresentation as a layout aid, not to use it for composition.andP;  (DesignSoftware doesn't have handamp;j.)andP;  The text can include a headline, byline, photocredits, quote boxes, and so on.andP;  The system provides an estimate of copylength based on the font, size and leading values in effect.andP;  As the designerlays out pages, columns of text can be linked and the linking instructionssent back to the host for use in composition.andP;  The screen doesn'tdifferentiate between justified and unjustified copy.andM;Other items added recently include manual kerning of headlines, interactivesizing of photos by pulling handles, a facility for copying photos and usingthem elsewhere within the layout, the ability to save a color palette andreuse it, facilities for picking up a color value from a photo and using itas a limit in producing a degradee, an &quot;undo&quot; feature to revert to the statusprior to the most recent action, the ability to view and work with multiplepages displayed at the same time, graphic import filters (TIFF, EPSF and PICTformats), generation of a specification sheet for the page being designed toprovide hard copy of the specifications, and 100 guides that can be displayedin each direction, which can be locked and released as desired.andM;Compatible Systems EngineeringandM;Although it began life as a developer of Atex front-end software, CompatibleSystems Engineering is gradually evolving into a system integrator.andP;  It iscombining its own products, adding terminals, networking and other hardware,and interfacing with systems from other vendors (e.g., Magna and Quark) tooffer more complete solutions for newspaper and magazine publishers.andM;As promised, CSE showed that its PageSpec page layout program can now displaytext, rather than merely layout boxes.andP;  This feature, in which Bitstreamoutlines are rasterized on the fly, adds roughly $ 1,200 to the programhsprice, bringing the total software cost for a PageSpec workstation to about$8,700.andP;  Pages can currently be created in PageSpec for use in an Atexcomposition system, a Crosfield or Scitex color system, or Bestinfo'sSuperPage; the software does not yet work with Bestinfo's more recentcomposition product, Wave4.andM;There is also a PageSpec interface to Quark Xpress, enabling Xpress-producedlayouts to be moved into an Atex system.andP;  Combined with PageSpec's links toCrosfield and Scitex, this is a flexible alternative to DeskLink RSG andVisionary, programs that take files from desktop composition programs(Letraset's ReadySetGo and Quark Xpress, respectively) into high-end colorsystems (Crosfield for the former, Scitex for the latter).andM;A full PageSpec system, comprising a 20-MHz '386 PC with 2 MB of RAM, an80387 math coprocessor, a 19&quot; display and PageSpec software, costs $17,000.andO;CSE is porting PageSpec to the Macintosh, where the software is likely tosell in the $3,500 range.andP;  The company said at the Seminars that Macs and PCswould be able to exchange spec files within a month.andM;A new CSE product, PC-Page, merges composed galleys with pages created inPageSpec to produce a page file for typesetting.andP;  The announced interfacesfor PC-Page are for Autologic APS-5, Linotronic 202 and L300, and III'sVideocomp; more (for instance, CG 8400 and 8600) are in the works.andP;  PC-Pagesupports the full complement of Fontware outline typefaces.andP;  As a story iscoming to the screen, the operator can halt the repainting of that story inorder to reach a desired article more quickly.andM;Also on display was NewsLinx, the Macintosh-based editing package introducedat last fall's Seybold Desktop Publishing Conference (see the seybold Reporton Desktop Publishing, Vol.andP;  3, No.andP;  3, p. 64).andP;  NewsLinx, which is used toprepare files for Atex systems offers rich facilities for user modification,ranging from simple keyboard remapping to associating typesetting formatswith Mac font styles.andM;We were disappointed by the absence of a couple of anticipated products.andP;  Wehad hoped to look at a new PC-based handamp;j program running on a Novell network,but that program was not yet ready for prime time.andP;  CSE said it would beshown the following month at a meeting of the Atex Commercial Users Group.andO;And we wanted to see single-key access to Magna's handamp;j from within XyWrite,but technical problems prevented CSE from demonstrating it.andM;Computer Peripheral SciencesandM;CPS, which has had its plate full with exhibits recently (not only at theSeminars, but also at America East, March 29-31, and at Type-X, April 6-8),is using these occasions to demonstrate its new-generation, Astrotek 3000+system strategy.andP;  The strategy includes new, attractive packaging of theAstrotek system (formerly CPS), incorporation of a '386 coprocessor with thesystem's proprietary bit-slice CPU, a SCSI bus for interfacing local areanetworks, the use of PCs as workstations on the system, and convenient linksfor pagination with Ventura Publisher (and maybe other packages later).andM;The packaging is finished, as is the ability to run the standard CPS softwareand to use PCs as system terminals, although handamp;j still takes place in thesystem CPU, not in the PC.andP;  The part being completed currently is theinterface between the system and Ventura.andP;  The idea is to have the Venturauser access directories of files on the system CPU and perform pagination.andO;Precomposed files will be sent with hard line endings, which will be honoredby Ventura to avoid conflicting handamp;j results from the two systems.andP;  Editingand corrections will be possible either within Ventura or on PC editingterminals.andP;   Obviously there will be questions about how the two handamp;j programsinteract in some of those situations.andP;  Because we are expecting to see thisfunction in later development at Type-X, we'll report on the paginationquestion in more detail at that time.andM;PCs on the system can be connected directly to the central CPU or can run ona network that is linked to the CPU.andP;  Any PC can run editorial or classifiedsoftware, in addition to applications such as XyWrite.andP;  If a PC is runningXyWrite, it can send a file to the CPU for handamp;j and bring it back to see lineendings, get a dept count (in inches, lines and picas) and indicate errors.andO;The story doesn't come back automatically; it must be called back by theuser.andM;Concept Publishing SystemsandM;Concept has been moving on the color front for its AdWorks display ad systemand also has provided some nice enhancements to text features of itsproducts.andM;Spot colors can be assigned using CYMK, RGB, HSV or HSL values and can begiven tints or patterns.andP;  Custom colors can be created by specifying thepercentage of each color being mixed.andP;  To aid in matching a new color with anexisting one, the screen displays both colors side by side.andP;  Colors createdfor use in a file are stored with the file.andM;Concept demonstrated the ability to import color images (in TIFF, EPSF, PICTor PNTG formats) and display them on the screen with cropping and scalingenabled.andP;  The company was hoping to announce an interface with a high-endcolor system, but apparently wasn't able to work out the details in time.andM;On the text front, Concept has beefed up its handamp;j program.andP;  It now uses CircleNoetic's Dashes logical hyphenation algorithm, based on the use ofpreferential hyphenation points.andP;  As we understand it, the system allows theoperator to specify which levels of words are permitted and then bases itsline break on whichever one of the permitted hyphenation points provides theoptimum word space.andM;Also supported are two hypenation exception dictionaries.andP;  One dictionary,unlimited in size, contains whole words.andP;  The other contains roots.andP;  Wordscan be inserted easily--a good thing, because the dictionaries are suppliedwith only 1,700 entries in total.andP;  The system first looks in the whole-worddictionary, then checks for roots, and finally attempts logical hyphenation.andM;Concept has added some other text-handling features that have niceapplications in jobs where the format remains the same, but editorial matterchanges.andP;  For example, weather maps may report the same cities' names butchange the temperatures daily.andP;  Or sports pages may use a &quot;ladder&quot; format toreport the results of elimination tournaments, with the format staying thesame but the names and scores changing.andM;The system facilitates handling these requirements by enabling the operatorto set up the structure of the item by embedding the appropriate codes in atext file that serves as a template and then by providing easy means offilling in the changed information.andP;  Functions supported include goingdirectly to a specific item, going to the next box, going to a named box,global replacements, etc.andM;One customer currently using this facility is the National Hot RodAssociation, which reports its racing results in a ladder format.andP;  Theinformation is entered on a Burroughs computer and fed to the Concept systemfor production.andM;Other new features from Concept include a &quot;step and repeat&quot; capability forimplementing the same function multiple times in different locations, theability to select all objects created with a particular tool, cursor movementin pixel (&quot;option arrow&quot;) or 10-pixel (&quot;shift arrow&quot;) increments horizontallyor vertically, and a &quot;snapshot&quot; tool for outputting selected portions of alarge ad (in addition to an existing tiling function).andM;CTextandM;CText used its exhibit to demonstrate the Tomahawk composition enginedeveloped by Deucalion Resources Group, which will provide a new,sophisticated composition program for CText systems toward the end of thisyear.andP;  We discuss Tomahawk elsewhere in this report.andM;Electronic Publisher InternationalandM;EPI unveiled the beginning of what may turn out to be a nice facility forrouting and tracking stories and other elements in a newsroom.andP;  Running on aMacintosh, it is based on the Fourth Dimension database program and can beused in conjunction with Quark Xtensions and Quark Xpress to provide pagecomposition with some nice database facilities.andM;The program, called DataPage, wasn't complete at the Seminars.andP;  It isscheduled to be demonstrated in a significantly more advanced stage at theMacintosh Business Conference andamp; Exposition in New York, April 17-19, so wewill save most of our comments for that time.andM;It is intended to allow production tracking of stories and illustrations,revision tracking of editorial matter, archiving, editing and file organizingfor multiple applications, automatic layout of imported stories, etc.andO;Stories can be routed to tasks and to users through dialog boxes, withcomments attached to the story for the recipient, who can call up the storywhen it appears in his input tray.andM;For page composition with Xpress, DataPage automates some of the layoutprocedures by making it possible to dummy a page and &quot;attach&quot; a story to aspace in the layout.andP;  The system flows the text according to the specifiedformat.andM;After a story has been placed on a page, it can be called up for editing, atwhich time it becomes locked out to other users on the network, althoughother stories on the page remain accessible.andP;  Stories that are locked appeargrayed out on the page view.andP;  To find out who has opened a story, a userclicks on it.andP;  Additional information about any story can be viewed bycalling up the story's info box.andM;EPI also showed its Editor and its System Valet.andP;  The Editor provides wordprocessing capabilities, a depth estimate based on font information, multiplewindows, support for wire capture, an audit trail of a story's progressaround the news-room, a headfit routine, and the ability to assign run dates,sections and comments to stories.andP;  The Valet includes a user's personaldiary, address files and the programs that he or she may want to launch,which is done by selecting the appropriate icon.andM;Information internationalandM;Triple-I had some new developments to talk about and to demonstrate.andP;  For thenonnewspaper market, it had acquired DocuPro, which exhibited separately andwill be discussed in another section of this report.andP;  For newspapercustomers, it showed what may prove to be a major extension to its TECS/2 byMorris system, centering on its Editor's Page Planner software module.andP;  Italso showed a soft-copy preview.andM;Editor's Page Planner, which had been previewed at ANPA and IFRA last year,is developing nicely.andP;  It takes an ad stack or pages with ad stacks fromTriple-I's Layout Advisor and provides a facility for designing the newshole.andM;The user interface is nice, supporting a color monitor for user assignment ofcolors to different types of elements (headlines, body text, halftones,etc.); a component window to select heads, bylines, and so on; support for amouse and keyboard commands for most layout functions; and a user-definablegrid.andP;  The program easily accommodates layout functions, such as allocationof space for art or photos.andM;It supports a &quot;story budget,&quot; displayable on the left-hand side of thescreen, next to the display of the page plan.andP;  The story budget is a list ofthose stories that have been generated on TECS/2 and assigned to a particularlogical section (sports, business, etc.), for a particular publication, torun on a  particular day.andP;  The depth field reflects the actual depth of thewritten story on TECS/2, if the story has been written.andM;Stories also can be assigned to the layout on Editor's Page Planner beforethey are generated on TECS/2.andP;  These stories end up in a list on TECS/2.andO;When a TECS/2 user selects a story from the list, a TECS/2 take, with allformatting information, is automatically generated for that story in theuser's directory.andP;  The user can then write the story to fit the assigned newshole.andM;After a story is laid out on a page, the user can choose to &quot;release&quot; thestory to the Page Design Node, where the story geometry is converted toTECS/2 formatting codes.andP;  Story geometry isn't sent to the PDN every time thepage is stored.andP;  This allows the user to Editor's Page Planner to release astory to the PDN, even though the page isn't totally laid out.andP;  It also keepsincomplete stories from being sent to the PDN.andM;The PDN is a dedicated TECS/2 workstation that receives the page geometryfrom the Editor's Page Planner and converts the data to TECS/2 formattingcodes.andP;  It maintains information on all stories and all pages.andM;The story then can be called up on a TECS/2 terminal, composed against thelayout specifications, and viewed in monospaced mode or using the newsoft-copy preview, tentatively called TECS/2 Composition Preview.andP;  Inmonospaced mode, the screen displays relevant layout information includingjump lines and headline parameters.andP;  another screen associated with the storyprovides layout and other information about the story, including its desireddepth and its actual depth, plus the amount over- or underset.andP;  The PDNautomatically updates the depth information when the story is stored.andM;Multiple users can call up different stories from the same page at the sametime.andM;The preview uses generic fonts scaled to show actual widths.andP;  It displays astory at a time, including its formatting into legs, relevant indents, etc.andO;The screen can be viewed in actual size, reduced to fit or enlarged.andM;Editor's PagePlanner, which requires an AT or PS/2 with 640K of memory and a30-MB hard disk, will serve as a page design station for the TECS/2 system,or as part of a full system that uses the company's soon-to-be-announced PagePreview station, based on a Sun workstation, for page proofing and output offull pages to Triple-I's 3810 Laser PageSetter.andP;  The two systems would usethe same story budget information.andM;LaserMakerandM;In addition to showing the latest developments in its layout system,LaserMaker demonstrated its new network functionality.andP;  The system runs on aNovel network with a dedicated file server.andP;  Directory and copy routingfacilities are good.andM;The system supports user-customizable file headers, from which directoriescan be generated based on any of the header fields.andP;  A nice touch here isthat the first character in the depth field can be used to get a list of allfiles of that length.andP;  Directories can extend across system subdirectories.andM;Stories can be routed to different desks by specifying the desk name and thenstoring the file, at which time the story moves to the other desk.andP;  Afterbeing moved, it no longer appears in the original desk directory.andP;  A backupcopy of the story can be saved in a &quot;ghost&quot; directory of the reporter, notappearing in the active directory.andM;Other features of the network implementation include an automatic savefacility based on user-defined intervals, with the ability to revert to themost recent manual save; locking only of individual files in use so thatmultiple users can access different files on the same page at the same time;read-only access to files in use by other operators; a display of all basketsavailable to a particular user; and spooling to multiple output devices.andM;Meanwhile, layout functions are being added as well.andP;  The system now importsand displays Encapsulated PostScript files.andP;  Photos or boxes can beoverlapped, with gutters set around them if desired.andP;  Libraries of logos,images or other standing matter will be supported so that they can beaccessed conveniently for repetitive use--as in boxes with round corners,department heads, etc.andP;  Headlines now can be moved separately from the bodyof stories.andP;  Containers or frames can be linked in any order on a page orpages.andM;Publishing TechnologiesandM;Publishing Technologies Inc. (PTI) showed its PC-based remote newspaperclassified ad system for use by advertising agencies.andP;  Ad Star stores theinformation necessary to process ads as formats.andP;  Criteria such as font,style and size are held in the header of an ad, with the ad details in therecord itself; error checking takes place in the PC.andM;Once prepared, ads can be sent to the host system, held or &quot;trialed,&quot; wherebyan ad goes to the newspaper Telecommunications Processor (TP--a '286 PC),which works out how the ad will look and then returns it to Ad Star.andP;  Anoperator can then either send the ad or redo it.andP;  This transfer, usingsoftware and the TP (which functions as a translator), conforms to the newlyreleased ANCAM/ANPA guidelines for the transmission of advertising.andP;  Thisstandard of software specifications allows an agency to place ads in as manynewspapers as it chooses without the need to adjust the ad to reach anewspaper's specific front-end system.andP;  The standard was adopted on January20, 1988; Ad Star is the first available product we are aware of that isANCAM/ANPA compliant.andM;Ad Star is sold by licensing, with a licensing fee and an implementation fee.andO;The former is based on the day of the week with the highest circulation of anewspaper; the latter is based on PTI's estimate of costs of installation andcustomization, ranging from $3,500 to $15,000.andP;  Pricing includes theTelecommunications Processor and full support.andP;  Existing PTI equipment can beupgraded to the ANCAM/ANPA-compliant system.andM;SerifandM;Serif, the UK-based developer of a system for producing display ads, had itsown exhibit.andP;  Since we last saw the product, which runs within MicrosoftWindows, it has added facilities for formatting ads from a model.andP;  Mergecodes are embedded in the text stream at places where the format changes, theformatting model is specified, and new text automatically fits the model.andM;Also new is a grouping function that enables acting on all items in agroup--text or otherwise.andP;  The system supports generic tagging using stylesheets that can be redefined by command.andM;Boxes can be divided by command and then handled independently.andP;  The systemsupports snapping to grids and guides, plus useful alignment tools.andP;  Graphicsfacilities import, crop, scale and position TIFF and EPSF formats.andP;  A picturecan be scrolled within a window and cropped.andP;  Photos or text can be rotatedin one-tenth of a degree increments.andM;The hyphenation and justification algorithm is shaping up quite well.andP;  Itbases its calculation on the optimum word space, with options of usingpositive or negative letterspacing to achieve good breaks.andP;  Hyphenation logiccomes from the  Hyphenologist, in the UK.andP;  No dictionary is available yet.andO;Tracking and pair kerning are supported.andM;On the marketing front Serif's progress is slower.andP;  The deal with GBTechniques, which we reported earlier, is taking time to complete amarketable product because Gbt want the display ad functionality to bethoroughly integrated into its Mentor system.andM;Graphic Systems (France) similarly is taking time to get the Serif productready for its market, but expects to launch it at a show in May, supportingthe French language and an Ace output device.andM;As of the seminars, Serif had reached an agreement in principle with HighWater Designs to develop a version of the product to run on Sun workstations.andO;It already is being ported to run within Presentation Manager.andP;  So we expectto see things start to happen over the next few months.andM;Software Consulting ServicesandM;The exhibit afforded us our first view of Software Consulting Services' suiteof Quark Xpress interfaces, known collectively as SCS/LinX (Layout Interfacesto Xpress).andP;  Developed as Quark Xtensions, they enable Xpress to import adsizes and positions from Layout 8000, SCS's ad dummying program; marked-uptext from newspaper front-end systems (including Atex, SCS and SII); andmade-up display ads from a Digital Technology system.andM;We saw a demonstration of a newspaper page, with ad placements specified inLayout 8000, being worked on in Xpress.andP;  The operator sets the design (pagesize, number of pages and of columns per page, etc.) by selecting anappropriate Layout 8000 file.andP;  He then chooses whether the pages beingassembled are those for a specified edition or those common to all editions.andO;Next, he brings in the page dummy, which contains boxes showing each ad'snumber, size, account name, description and color information.andP;  He useseditorial text, ads and illustrations from various sources to fill the page.andO;Finally, he makes any necessary modifications to the page with Xpress'stools.andM;Despite SCS/LinX's newness, the vendor claims that it is being used by 25customers.andM;We enjoyed another look at SCS's Personal Librarian program (see Vol.andP;  17,No.andP;  16, p. 53), which has also been linked to Xpress by an Xtension.andO;Personal Librarian offers intelligent text searches far beyond the typicalboolean options.andP;  Though it has been in the field for about a year (theMicrosoft Windows implementation is somewhat more recent), it appears not abit dated.andM;System IntegratorsandM;SII focused on its &quot;Coyote PC&quot; (PS/2), which had been demonstrated at IFRA,but was making its first U.S.andP;  appearance.andP;  As we reported last fall, itinvolves putting an SII board in a PC to enable it to function as a Coyoteterminal, with single key toggling between MS-DOS and SII modes.andP;  It supportsimporting ASCII text, but not with customizable conversion of command codes.andO;SII said it had started shipping the product.andM;The PC LAN Interface (PCLI) that we had hoped to see wasn't available.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
