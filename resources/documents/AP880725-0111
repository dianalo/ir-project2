(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Residents are ready to greet thehumming toadfish in its yearly mating ritual with a comparablehuman sound: They're going to play kazoos.   Until the humming toadfish was identified as living inRichardson Bay in 1985, residents were baffled by a strange hummingsound coming from the water.   The July 31 celebration will include more than 25 environmentalgroups, as well as ecological and historical exhibits, lectures andboat tours _ all in honor of the fish.   The humming toadfish used to be an irritating puzzle that awokeSausalito houseboat residents nightly, beginning toward the end ofJuly.   ``The first time it happened, practically everybody in thehouseboats jumped out of bed and looked in their electricalboxes,'' said Suzanne Simpson, a festival spokeswoman and one ofthe many houseboat residents who had no idea what the eerie buzzingsound was when it first occurred in 1984.   In their search for mates, the male fish emit the humming noiseand other buzzing sounds through vibrating gas bladders.</TEXT><DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Even though the two ``all-star'' softballteams were playing in the Metrodome home of the Minnesota Twins,there was no danger of mistaking them for baseball's 1987 worldchampions.   However, the benefit game Sunday between the Democratic FarmerLabor and Independent Republican teams had some of the trappings ofmajor league baseball.   There were at least four inside-the-park home runs and somespectacular fielding plays during the game won by the IR team,20-13.   A pitcher suspected of scuffing the softball was even ejectedfor allegedly concealing a huge wad of sandpaper while on the moundin the manner of Twins pitcher Joe Niekro. Niekro was suspended for10 days last year after being caught with an emery board andsandpaper on the mound in Anaheim, Calif.   The softball game was billed as a benefit between IRpoliticians, led by former state Rep. David Jennings, chairman ofGeorge Bush's Minnesota campaign, and DFLers, who were led byco-captains U.S. Rep. Martin Sabo and state Rep. Phyllis Kahn. Eachgroup sold about 500 $12 tickets.   About 400 of the 38,008 fans who attended the Twins-Orioles gamestayed to watch the slapstick game.   Kahn, the DFL co-captain and starting pitcher, was resplendentin iridescent purple, pink and green plaid shorts. She had sometrouble controlling her pitches and was replaced in the secondinning after yielding 11 runs.   ``The most important thing, in politics as well as baseball, isto know when it's time to move on,'' Kahn said.   In the fifth inning, with the IRs leading 12-8, Sabo complainedabout the IR pitcher, state Rep. Chris Tjornhom, and asked theumpire to check for illegalities.   Sabo accompanied the umpire to the mound, where a large piece ofsandpaper fell to the ground next to the pitcher. Tjornhom, lookingindignant, was ejected.</TEXT></DOC>
