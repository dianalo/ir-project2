On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the October contract forWest Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, wasquoted 57 cents higher at $15.12 a 42-gallon barrel shortly afterthe market opened, from Tuesday's settlement price of $14.56.   Contracts had traded between $14.33 a barrel and $14.70 a barrelTuesday after Monday's whiplash session in which prices dropped toa near two-year low of $13.75 before rebounding to settle at $14.49.   Wholesale unleaded gasoline for October delivery zoomed 1.94cents a gallon in early trading to 45.80 cents from Tuesday's closeof 43.81 cents a gallon.   The October wholesale heating oil contract also was up sharply,trading about 1.22 cents a gallon higher than its close of 41.83cents a gallon on Tuesday.   ``This could be one of the wildest trading days with all thenews,'' said Peter Beutel, assistant director of Elders FuturesInc. in New York.   Analysts said today's market was continuing the bullishsentiment started Tuesday on concerns that refineries and oilplatforms were being evacuated in anticipation of the approachingstorm.   ``If the hurricane hits the Gulf coast, there's concern aboutshort-term gasoline supplies,'' said Chris McCormack, an energyanalyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.   Analysts said that although Hurricane Gilbert had not damagedthe Gulf oil fields, between 600,000 and 800,000 gallons a day ofgasoline could be lost if production was halted to wait out thestorm.   Meanwhile, this morning's market also reacted strongly to anannouncement by OPEC Secretary General Subroto that the cartel'spricing committee had set a meeting date of Sept. 25-26.   The announcement generates hope that the 13-member Organizationof Petroleum Exporting Countries will call for a full meeting ofthe cartel to set production limits and curb the ouput that hasflooded world oil markets and eroded prices, analysts said.   Meanwhile, oil brokers were saying this week that the recent dipin oil prices had not affected retail prices yet but by winterconsumers could realize some benefits at the pump.   ``If we see another $2 slide in (oil) prices, then consumergasoline prices could be expected to go 7 to 8 cents lower whenit's all over _ by Thanksgiving,'' said Stephen Smith, an analystwith Bear Stearns andamp; Co.   Other oil brokers said that if crude prices remained between the$13.50 and $15.50 levels in the next several weeks, retail gasolineprices could decline by about 2 cents a gallon.</TEXT></DOC>
