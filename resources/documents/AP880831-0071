Brountas said ``there's a very serious issue of George Bush'sjudgment. When he was supposed to be in charge of fighting thebattle against terrorism ... he apparently endorsed a decision ...to trade arms with the ayatollah for hostages, which happens to beone of the most disastrous events in foreign policy history.''   Dukakis on Tuesday questioned whether Bush's failure to blockthe arms deal showed he lacked the judgment to be president.Dukakis noted that Bush was head of an anti-terrorism task forcethat shortly before the 1985 arms deal with Iran issued a reportwarning against concessions to terrorist nations.   The Democratic presidential nominee was spending most of todayat the Massachusetts Statehouse before flying to California forthree days of campaigning in Western states.   He spent Tuesday in Western Massachusetts on a gubernatorialtrip, but took time to launch his harshest attack on Bush to dateand declare that he was going to respond aggressively to Republicancriticism.   Dukakis, in a meeting with area editors and later at a newsconference, noted Bush's position as head of an anti-terrorism taskforce that shortly before the 1985 arms deal with Iran issued areport warning against concessions to terrorist nations.   ``The president and the vice president and a number of otherpeople, over the opposition of the secretary of state and thesecretary of defense by the way, proceeded to do precisely whatthat commission said you should never do,'' Dukakis said.   ``How can you possibly sit there and do nothing while we tradedarms to a terrorist nation?'' he asked.   At the news conference, Dukakis cited a new book by Maine Sens.William Cohen and George Mitchell in which they said the Republicannominee appeared to have endorsed the arms-for-hostages deal.   ``Making tough decisions is a test of leadership,'' Dukakissaid. ``George Bush endorsed the decision to sell arms to Iran andin doing so he failed that test.''   Cohen, a Republican, and Mitchell, a Democrat, were members ofthe congressional Iran-Contra investigating panel. Mitchell wasvisiting with Dukakis today.   Dukakis, asked to respond to Bush's charges that he was toowilling to make concession to the Soviets in arms negotiations,said the American people should match his record of making toughdecisions with that of the vice president.   Dukakis mentioned the Iran-Contra affair, the Reaganadministration's dealings with Panamanian leader Gen. ManuelAntonio Noriega and Bush's support of deposed Philippine PresidentFerdinand Marcos in the early 1980s.   ``I would be very concerned about someone with that kind ofjudgment negotiating with the Soviet Union,'' Dukakis said.   The Massachusetts governor also returned Bush's rhetoricalsalvos that Dukakis was soft on defense, and reiterated hisopposition to the Star Wars anti-missile system, two newsupercarrier task forces and rail-based MX missiles.   ``Mr. Bush says he wants them all,'' Dukakis said. ``You can'thave them all, not if you're serious about providing the resourcesour conventional forces need and not if you're serious aboutgetting that deficit down.''   Dukakis, characterizing Bush as irresponsible on fiscal matters,mentioned Bush's support of the ``exotic'' weapons systems,increased education spending, a tax-credit for child care and a $40billion cut in the capital gains tax.   ``That is not a responsible approach to the basic fiscalproblems, or for that matter the national security problems, whichface our country,'' the Democratic nominee said.   Dukakis also lashed out against Bush's record on crime.   ``What's the Bush record? What's the Dukakis record? I don'tknow what the Bush record is,'' Dukakis said. ``It's a blank. Onthe rare occasions when the vice president has been asked to dosomething on this subject, it's been a failure.''   Dukakis said he wished the campaign rhetoric was focused more onmajor issues but he adopted a more aggressive stance against GOPattacks, which have included questions about Dukakis' patriotismand jokes about his height.   ``If it continues, you have to respond,'' he said. ``I thinkthat's unfortunate, but I think it's very clear what kind ofcampaign the Republicans are running and I think we're going tohave to deal with it.''</TEXT></DOC>
