The members of the Lebanese parliament are considering``balancing and overlapping powers'' of a Christian president, aSunni Moslem premier and a Shiite Moslem parliament speaker,conference sources said.   Conflicts among these Lebanese factions have been feeding thecivil war that broke out in April 1975 and has ravaged the nation,claiming the lives of an estimated 150,000 people.   Most recently, Christian leader Gen. Michel Aoun in Marchsparked six months of lethal shelling when he declared a ``war ofliberation'' against the 40,000 Syrian troops in Lebanon, accusingthem of siding with the Moslems.   A Arab mediating team made up of Saudi Arabia, Morocco andAlgeria, acting on mandate of the 22-member Arab League, arranged acease-fire Sept. 22 that generally has been holding.   Sixty-three of the 73 surviving members of the parliament havebeen meeting in this Saudi mountain resort since Saturday todiscuss a plan drafted by the Arab League team for ending thesectarian strife. It calls for political reforms and later Syrianwithdrawal.   Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal steered thedeputies away from Christian demands that Syria withdraw beforereforms are agreed, to concrentrate on the division of power in theLebanese government, long dominated by Maronite Christians.   The conference sources said they expected the result to beessentially ``a mechanism of check, recheck and countercheck'' witha view to averting dictatorship or the supremacy of one religiousfaction over the others.   But the debate indicated a continuing difference of views.   Sources said several deputies rallied behind Maronite Christianleader George Saadeh in advocating that the authority of thepowerful president, a Maronite under the present unwritten nationalaccord, be left unchanged.   ``It would be hard on us to render our president a meredistributor of medals and decorations,'' Saadeh was quoted astelling the session.   But pro-Syrian Moslem deputy Zaher Khatib told deputies ``we arenot in the process of shifting powers from one religious faction toanother, we are trying to curtail the powers of a dictatorial rulerand entrust them to a council of leadership (the cabinet ofministers).''   A compromise called for continuing the presidential powers butabolishing the tradition of apportioning senior civil service slotsalong sectarian lines, now favoring Christians who dominate themilitary, judiciary and economy.   The deputies met in closed session 10 miles away from the presscenter where reporters were restricted.   One pro-Syrian deputy, Najah Wakim, unexpectedly showed up atthe press center late Monday and said ``opinion gaps among thelegislators on the powers of the president have been bridged, thegeneral atmosphere of discussions is favorable, and we arehopeful.''   He refused to elaborate and left the press center abruptly.   Sources said Oct. 21 has been tentatively fixed as the date fora formal session of parliament in Beirut to ratify the new charterthat would replace the unwritten accord of 1943.   Two weeks later, the deputies would then meet to elect a newpresident to replace Amin Gemayel, whose term ran out lastSeptember. Parliament was unable to meet to elect a successor andrival administrations sprang up led by Aoun and Moslem PrimeMinister Salim Hoss.</TEXT></DOC>
