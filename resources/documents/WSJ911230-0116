Crop Genetics will be the exclusive producer of virusproducts for the alliance, and will seek to develop low-costproduction techniques for the so-called IVPs. Du Pont will bethe exclusive global distributor and marketer of theproducts. As part of the agreement, Du Pont will contribute$3.75 million over two years to fund development of the IVPsat Crop Genetics.</LP><TEXT>   The companies said they will share the profits from theventure under a series of sale and supply agreements to benegotiated as the products are developed.   Insecticidal virus products are naturally occurringviruses that attack only specific insects, said Joseph W.Kelly, Crop Genetics' chairman and chief executive officer,in an interview. They aren't harmful to mammals or even otherinsects they're not targeted to, he said.   Frank W. Owen, global product manager for insecticides atDu Pont Agricultural Products, said in an interview that heanticipates bringing a product to market in the next fewyears. Mr. Kelly said he didn't expect any significantregulatory hurdles. He noted that a virus-type product tocontrol cotton pests had been approved in the 1970s, but waswithdrawn for economic reasons.   A spokeswoman for the Environmental Protection Agency saidnatural microbial pesticides aren't subject to the samestringent registration requirements as chemical pesticides,and thus take a lot less time to be approved than the two tothree years that chemical pesticides take.   On news of the agreement, Crop Genetics' stock soared$3.25, or 72% Friday, to close at $7.75 in nationalover-the-counter trading.   The world-wide market for insect control using all sortsof techniques could reach $7 billion to $8 billion, Mr. Owensaid. Du Pont's agricultural chemical business had 1990 salesof $1.76 billion worldwide, he said.   Mr. Owen said the alliance would broaden Du Pont's productoffering of biological insecticides, and &quot;demonstrates acommitment by both companies to provide growers witheffective, environmentally compatible products for integratedpest management programs.&quot;   &quot;They are highly selective and thus pose no threat towildlife, humans or nontargeted insects,&quot; said James H.Davis, vice president of research and development at CropGenetics. He said the IVPs are nonpolluting, because water,soil, sunlight and other environmental forces all work torapidly degrade their bioactivity.   The virus is encapsulated in an envelope that dissolves inthe insects' alkaline stomachs, Mr. Kelly explained. Thevirus is then free to attack other cells and spread until theinsect dies. Humans are protected from the viruses by virtueof their acidic stomachs, and also because the virus can onlyreplicate in certain cells.   But the viruses, which would compete with chemicalpesticides and bacterial agents, have been very expensive toproduce, and no such products are currently marketed in theU.S., Mr. Kelly said.   &quot;We believe we have the technology . . . to be competitivewith the products currently used by growers,&quot; Mr. Kelly said.In the summer, Crop Genetics applied to the EPA forregistration of three insect virus products.   Mr. Kelly said the companies would target the fruit andvegetable markets, where chemical and bacterial agents areused extensively. The insecticidal virus products are sprayedon crops, and will be targeted primarily to lepidoptera,insects that transform from caterpillar to moth or butterfly.Mr. Kelly said initially the alliance would develop productsto control insects that attack lettuce and tomato plants.Later, the products would be targeted to insects that attackcorn, rice and wheat.   Du Pont, Wilmington, Del., is a chemicals, energy andspecialty products company and is one of the largestsuppliers of crop protection products in the U.S. CropGenetics, which has annual sales of about $2 million, isdeveloping biological pesticides systems to control insects,diseases and weeds in agriculture and forestry. It currentlymarkets disease-free sugar cane seed.</TEXT></DOC>
