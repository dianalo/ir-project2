No pickup.</NOTE><DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An opposition group calling itself the DemocraticUnion held an organizational meeting Saturday to establish apolitical party as an alternative to the Communist Party, a leadingdissident said.   Police, including some ranking officers, gathered outside thedowntown apartment building where the meeting was held, SergeiGrigoryants said Sunday. He said he knew of no arrests.   Grigoryants, who has been active among Moscow's dissidents, saidhe went by the building but did not participate in the meeting.   The Soviet Communist Party has ruled as the only officialpolitical party since the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution and has givenno indication it is willing to accept any organized opposition.   Attempts in the past to organize opposition parties have led toarrests, imprisonment or exile.   Grigoryants said the goal of the Democratic Union is creation ofa democratic, pluralistic society without a central role for theCommunist Party.   He said as many as 250 people from Moscow, Leningrad,Novosibirsk and the Ukraine gathered Saturday to discuss the goalsof the group and prepare documents declaring their principles.There was no confirmation of that figure and few apartments in thecapital could accommodate such a large crowd.   The talks are expected to continue for two or three days,according to Grigoryants.   The group gathered in the Krasnaya Presnaya neighborhood in anapartment building near the modern office building housing thegovernment of the Russian Federation, the largest of the 15republics that make up the Soviet Union.   Also meeting in Moscow this weekend were representatives of some30 independent publications that have been established in defianceof the government's monopoly on published information.   The newspapers and journals, concerned primarily with politicaland religious affairs, have limited circulation because thegovernment controls all printing presses. Some are only typewrittensheets passed among friends.   It was the second meeting of independent publishers. A similarsession was held in Leningrad last fall.   Such open gatherings are an indication of the increased officialtolerance of dissent since Mikhail Gorbachev came to power threeyears ago as Communist Party chief.   Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or openness, encourages greaterdiscussion of some issues and debate within the party apparatus.But he and other officials have said glasnost has its limits, andit is not clear how much opposition the government and party arewilling to tolerate.   Democratization is one of the key words of Gorbachev's programfor reforming the Soviet system, but he has used it to mean greaterparticipation in the affairs of the government, party and state-runenterprises.   He has promoted democratization as a means of shaking up theentrenched bureaucracy and installing a more aggressive leadership.He has not, however, suggested the process should go so far as topermit a direct challenge to the Communist Party's monopoly onpower.</TEXT></DOC>
