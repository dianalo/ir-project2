<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-04-1220 </DOCNO><TEXT>The closed-cycle gas turbine, the heater and the parabolic dish collectorare well-known components which have been proven in terrestrial environment.They would also form the main components of extraterrestrial solar powerplants. Their net efficiencies are far higher and the construction effortinvolved is far lower than for direct conversion, especially when thetemperature level of the radiator is raised, for any reason, above thatpostulated here. Used as a modular station, the solar power plant inspace presents a final solution since it uses a permanently renewableenergy source. In conjunction with industrial space stations the space-basedpower plant provides a high-temperature technology with which solar energycan be converted both into electricity and, equally efficiently, intoprocess heat. Microwave transmission of electricity to Earth would doaway with pollution of our atmosphere and provide a decentralized energysupply. Depending on requirements, direct or indirect power generationis needed for energy supplies in research, weather, survey and communicationssatellites, in space laboratories and spacecraft such a space vehicles,space ships with landing modules, etc. Photovoltaics are used for smalloutputs, the Stirling engine is available for medium outputs and thegas turbine as a thermoelectric converter for large output.</TEXT></DOC>
