After the surging British pound broke through 3.10 West German marks, Mr. Lawson directed the Bank of England to lower its money-market intervention rate by one-half of a percentage point. The move prompted the major British banks to announce a corresponding reduction in their base lending rates, to 8.5% from 9%, reversing a half-point increase instituted Feb. 1.    The pound fell back in reaction to the news. It then rebounded against the mark, although it eased against the dollar. The West German mark is Europe's most important currency and its relationship to the pound is crucial in determining British monetary policy.    Britain seems to have decided that its strong currency -- which helps keep inflation down by making imports less expensive and prodding export industries to curb wage demands -- enables it to take the inflationary risk of lowering interest rates. And because the pound has climbed to levels that make policy makers uncomfortable, they will welcome the downward pressure that yesterday's cut is likely to exert on sterling.    Mr. Lawson's action yesterday boosted his political stature following his bruising public dispute with Mrs. Thatcher over currency and interest-rate levels. The quarrel surfaced in Parliament early this month when the pound broke through the three-mark barrier and the prime minister declared that curbing its rise with large-scale currency intervention or interest-rate cuts would be inflationary. Until then, Mr. Lawson had used both maneuvers to keep the pound below three marks.    The feud intensified three days later when Mrs. Thatcher and her chancellor made contradictory statements in Parliament over exactly what Britain's monetary policy was. Mr. Lawson asserted that a further rise in the pound would be &quot;unsustainable,&quot; while the prime minister remarked that Britain couldn't &quot;buck the foreign-exchange markets.&quot;    On Tuesday, Mr. Lawson appeared to cave in to the prime minister in his annual budget speech to Parliament. He failed to reaffirm his previous stand of keeping a stable pound-mark rate, an omission that prompted speculation that interest rates wouldn't come down anytime soon.    Thus yesterday's announcement of rate cuts took the market by surprise. Explaining her turnaround to Parliament, Mrs. Thatcher said she had become convinced that the magnitude of sterling's gains reduced the danger of inflation sufficiently to justify an interest-rate reduction.    A spokesman said Mrs. Thatcher &quot;felt that circumstances had changed&quot; because of sterling's rise and because of the cautious fiscal stance the chancellor took in his budget speech. But some analysts speculated she had made an uncharacteristic retreat in the face of a veiled threat by Mr. Lawson to resign. He had said that &quot;only time will tell&quot; whether Tuesday's budget speech would be his last.    &quot;The chancellor wanted to re-establish that he was responsible for interest rates,&quot; said David Morrison, a London-based currency economist for the U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs andamp; Co.    Mrs. Thatcher, known as the &quot;Iron Lady,&quot; has a long record of dominating her cabinet and forcing out ministers who challenge her authority. In the current government, only Mr. Lawson enjoys a reputation for standing up to her.    Analysts said yesterday the interest-rate reduction doesn't guarantee stability for sterling. It also wasn't clear whether the British government has set a new ceiling of 3.10 marks to the pound. &quot;There is absolutely no sign that official policy towards sterling is clear,&quot; commented Geoffrey Dennis, a currency economist at the London brokerage James Capel andamp; Co.    Nevertheless, the prime minister appears to have won at least one major concession from Mr. Lawson: that the Bank of England should intervene sparingly in the currency markets. As a result, wide swings in sterling could provoke a new period of interest-rate volatility for Britain.    &quot;If there is renewed demand for sterling, is another base rate cut possible or do they lift the (mark) ceiling?&quot; wondered George Magnus, a currency economist with Warburg Securities, a London securities house. Most analysts don't think another reduction is in the cards unless the pound soars again.    Concern about inflationary pressures caused British government bonds to fall three-quarters of a point following the base-rate cut. The gilt market later recovered to close unchanged. The stock market wasn't cheered by the news, either. The Financial Times 100-share index finished at 1828.1 yesterday, up only 2.4 points.    ---   U.K.'s Jobless Rate Declines   Special to The Wall Street Journal   LONDON -- British unemployment continued to decline in February.    The Employment Department said in a preliminary report that the jobless rate fell to a seasonally adjusted 9.1% of the labor force last month from 9.2% in January. Without seasonal adjustment, the rate was 9.6%, down from 11.6% a year earlier. </TEXT></DOC>
