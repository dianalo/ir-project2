<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-73-0540 </DOCNO><TEXT>A telephone survey of low-level waste generators has been carried outin order to make useful estimates of the volume and nature of the wastewhich the generators will be shipping for disposal when the compactsand states begin operating new disposal facilities. Emphasis of the surveywas on the industrial sector, since there has been little informationavailable on characteristics of industrial LLW. Ten large industrialgenerators shipping to Richland, ten shipping to Barnwell, and two whosewastes had previously been characterized by BNL were contacted. The wastevolume shipped by these generators accounted for about two-thirds tothree-quarters of the total industrial volume. Results are given in termsof the categories of LLW represented and of the chemical characteristicsof the different wastes. Estimates by the respondents of their near-termwaste volume projections are presented.</TEXT></DOC>
