If the Apple PostScript device usesandM;Apple-format fonts and the Adobe device uses Adobe-format fonts, you have aandM;real problem.andM;Apple expects to develop an answer to this problem.andP;  The preferred solutionandM;would be a utility program that converts Apple-format fonts into downloadableandM;Adobe-format fonts.andP;  In concept, users would have one font library on theirandM;Macs.andP;  The same font outlines would be used for screen display, for QuickDrawandM;printer output, for Apple PostScript printer output and (via a conversionandM;program that would be invisible to the user) as downloadable fonts on AdobeandM;PostScript printers.andM;Adobe, if you recall, has already countered by announcing its own TypeandM;Manager (ATM) font technology, which will allow Adobe-format outline fonts toandM;be displayed on the Macintosh screen and to be used to drive QuickDraw outputandM;devices that arc driven via a software Rip running in a host Macintosh.andM;Adobe PostScript printers.andP;  Although Apple expects that its customers willandM;migrate towards the Apple PostScript printers, it recognizes that someandM;customers will prefer Adobe PostScript machines using Adobe fonts.andP;  For this reason, it will continue to offer both Apple and Adobe PostScript printers forandM;as long as there is sufficient customer de mand for both.andP;  It has, in fact,andM;signed new PostScript product development agreement with Adobe.andM;Why Apple PostScript? Apple's decision to develop its own PostScript isandM;certain to be controversial.andP;  Why is Apple doing this? One incentive must beandM;the fact that it will not have to pay Adobe royalties on Apple PostScriptandM;machines.andP;  However, with the volume discounts that Apple gets from Adobe, weandM;doubt that this was the deciding factor.andP;  Rather, we think that Apple wantstoandM;control afl of its core technology-including imaging models and fontandM;technology.andP;  It also wants to be able to provide a single font format thatcanandM;drive afl Apple displays and output devices.andM;Customers with heterogeneous (mixed Mac, PC and/or Unix workstation)andM;environments are not likely to be thrilled by this.andP;  They already face aandM;situation in which Apple is adopting its own font technology and Microsoft isandM;likely to do the same.andP;  PostScript and PostScript fonts remain a commonandM;standard that both camps support.andP;  Now Apple will be moving Apple PostScriptandM;into the Apple Royal font world.andM;This is one reason why many Macintosh users may continue to prefer AdobeandM;PostScript printers, which can be driven by PCs and Unix workstations as wellandM;as Macs, to Apple PostScript machines, which are likely to be essentiallyandM;Mac-specific.andM;Apple strategies.andP;  In typical Apple fashion, the decision to build a cloneandM;strikes us as being inward-looking rather than outward-looking.andP;  We haveandM;always wondered why Apple was not more aggressive in selling LaserWritersandM;into the PC market.andP;  Apple clearly dominates the Macintosh PostScript printerandM;market.andP;  We think that it could have done much more to move its printers intoandM;PC and mixed Mac/PC installations.andM;Apple makes healthy profit margins on LaserWriters.andP;  Why not sell them toandM;PC users as well as Mac users? Moreover, you would think that placingandM;LaserWriters in PC shops would be an attractive means of getting a foot inandM;the door.andP;  IBM put an Apple LocalTalk interface on its PostScript printer;whyandM;hasn't Apple put a Centronics parallel port on its LaserWriters?andM;The move to Apple (rather than Adobe) PostScript printers is notandM;something you would do if you were concerned with selling the machines toandM;nonApple sites.andM;Apple/Adobe history.andP;  Ironically, it was Apple that really got Adobe-andandM;PostScript-off the ground.andP;  Steve jobs was convinced at a very early stageandM;that PostScript was the right idea.andP;  He signed an agreement with Adobe tohaveandM;Adobe develop the PostScript controller for the LaserWriter, and he arrangedandM;to have Apple invest in Adobe to help get the company off the ground.andP;  (HenceandM;Apple's 16.4% stake in Adobe.)andM;The tension between the QuickDraw imaging language used to draw images onandM;the Macintosh screen and the more sophisticated Adobe PostScript language hasandM;been clear from the beginning.andP;  Apple and Adobe bridged this by makingandM;bitmapped QuickDraw screen fonts to match the Adobe printer fonts and byandM;writing printer driver software to convert files from QuickDraw format intoandM;PostScript.andM;However, there have been problems with these bridges from theandM;beginning:andM;* Bit-mapped QuickDraw screen fontsandM;have been digitized only for certain sizes.andP;  Even at theseandM;sizes, the 72-dpiandM;screen fonts do not have exactly the same character widths as 300-dpi,andM;1250-dpi or 2500-dpi output recorder fonts.andP;  Many Macintosh programs forceandM;the output to follow screen font spacing-to the detriment ofandM;inter-character spacing on laser printer or typesetter output.andP;  (DesktopandM;publishing programs generally use printer spacing.andP;  The WriteNow wordandM;processing program gives the user a choice of screen font spacing [forandM;better legibility on the screen] or printer spacing [for betterandM;inter-character space on output].)andM;* QuickDraw assumes a fixed resolutionandM;of 72 dpi.andP;  PostScript is resolution-independent.andM;* PostScript can express many moreandM;things than can QuickDraw: rotatedandM;characters, complex (Bezier) curves,andM;clipping boundaries, etc.andM;The conversion from QuickDraw toandM;PostScript takes time and slows downandM;throughput on output printing.andM;It has always been clear that itandM;would be far more rational to use a single imaging model for both screenandM;display and hard copy output.andP;  This is the only way that you can be assuredandM;that what you see on the screen is truly what you will get on final output.andM;When we learned of the Apple/ Adobe deal in 1984, we urged Apple toandM;evolve QuickDraw with the goal of converging QuickDraw and PostScript overandM;time into a single imaging model.andP;  We believe that this would have beenandM;possible.andP;  In fact, we believe that the original Apple/Adobe agreement gaveandM;Apple the right to use PostScript for screen display as well as for printerandM;output.andM;But Apple never did this.andP;  Not long after the LaserWriter was introduced,andM;Steve Jobs was gone, and Jean-Louis Gassee had assumed responsibility forandM;charting Apple's product development course.andP;  Gassed decided that Apple mustandM;have control over its own imaging destiny and that PostScript was too complexandM;to be suitable as a display language for low-end Macintoshes.andM;Apple decided that it must evolve QuickDraw on its own.andP;  This decision hasandM;taken Apple and Adobe in different directions.andP;  The latest announcement isandM;further confirmation of this divergence.andM;Analysis.andP;  Apple is firmly convinced that Apple PostScript is a good move: *andM;It will give Apple more control over itsandM;imaging products and font technology.andP;  It should also increase Apple'sandM;profit margins.andM;* It should help to strengthen the marketandM;position of Apple's Royal font format.andM;More printers that can use the Royal font format means more cusandM;tomers forandM;Royal-format fonts, which means more incentive for font vendorsandM;to convertandM;their fonts to this format.andP;  * It will encourage Macintosh users toandM;use QuickDraw printers.andP;  Since these will use the same Royal fonts as theandM;Apple PostScript machines, and since they use the same QuickDraw imagingmodel used for display on the screen,andM;why bother with a PostScript printer at afl?andM;However, as indicated earlier, we think that this is another move byandM;Apple in the wrong (proprietary) direction.andP;  Surely Apple must realize thatandM;the most important reality of the coming decade will be heterogeneousandM;mixed-vendor) systems.andP;  The more it does to wall itself off from the rest ofandM;the computer world, the more barriers it establishes to using Macintoshes inandM;mixed-vendor systems.andP;  A closed Apple imaging/printing architecture is justandM;such a barrier.andM;Apple can still keep the door open to heterogeneous systems by continuingandM;to support Adobe PostScript (which it plans to do) and Adobe fonts (whichandM;Adobe promises to do without any help from Apple).andP;  But this support islikelyandM;to be seen as a begrudging accommodation to the rest of the world rather thanandM;as a core Apple strategy.andM;Apple is also, we believe, walking away from a very strong position inandM;the laser printer market.andP;  Apple is still the dominant supplier of 8-ppmAdobeandM;PostScript printers.andP;  We think it could have been very difficult to dislodgeandM;from that position.andP;  And, as we indicated earher, it could have become theandM;dominant supplier of PostScript printers even for PC and workstation users.andM;However, if customers believe that Apple's heart is in its own PostScriptandM;printers, the Apple brand on an Adobe PostScript device will almost certainlyandM;carry less weight than it has.andP;  This should make it easier for other vendorstoandM;sell Adobe PostScript printers to Macintosh users and others.andM;It will also, of course, make it easier for other vendors to sellandM;non-Adobe PostScript machines as weB.andP;  In essence, Apple has legitimizedandM;PostScript clones.andP;  If the company that put Adobe PostScript printers on theandM;map can move to clone technology, why shouldn't others?andM;Fragmenting a standard.andP;  What does this mean for users? The worst aspect oftheandM;Apple decision is that it makes the world more complicated for users becauseandM;it fragments an important standard.andM;Think of the consequences, for example, for typesetters, printers andandM;others who accept PostScript files: Even if Apple is able to supply aandM;Royal-to-PostScript font converter, service bureaus will still have to knowandM;which fonts were used to create the file.andP;  If the file was created usingAppleandM;fonts, the customer will have to send the fonts along with the job.andP;  SincetheandM;only way to use Apple fonts on an Adobe device is to include the fonts withandM;the job, there could be a real incentive for rampant copying of Apple-formatandM;fonts.andP;  Apple will certainly have to deal with this problem.andM;Next steps.andP;  Unfortunately, things are going to get worse.andP;  Microsoft is intheandM;process of choosing its font technology-which win almost certainly beandM;different from either the Adobe or the Apple font technology and font format.andM;We face the prospect of a world in which PCs and PC printers will use onefontandM;technology, Apple computers and Apple printers a second font technology, andandM;Adobe printers and screen displays a third.andM;The Compugraphic Intellifont format to be used by Hewlett-Packard PCLandM;Level 5 printers will be a further complicating factor, as will the Folio F3andM;format that will be used in Sun/ATandamp;T Unix workstations (see announcement,thisandM;issue).andP;  Microsoft may well elect to use one of these formats Intellifont orandM;F3) in Windows and Presentation Manager, of course.andP;  But at the moment, itandM;looks as if we will have at least three font formats to worry about, andandM;possibly five.andM;We will have a chance of this in more depth with the principals at theandM;Computer Publishing Conference in September.andP;  @@@075314223 0SRDHHo029ASAFandM;In our article &quot;Font Technology Battle Takes Center Stage&quot; in May (Vol.andP;  3,NoandM;9), we reported the announcement Adobe Type Manager.andP;  At the time, AdobeandM;announced that it would ship ATM for the Macintosh in the fall.andM;At MacWorld Expo this week, Adobe will preview ATM for both MacintoshandM;screen display and QuickDraw output.andP;  We have recently had the opportunity toandM;use the prototype software at Adobe.andP;  We were impressed.andM;ATM rasterizer.andP;  The heart of Adobe Type Manager is an entirely newrasterizerandM;to convert Adobe outline fonts into screen or printer bitmaps.andP;  The newandM;rasterizer is dramatically faster than the old at generatingscreen-resolutionandM;fonts.andP;  Even more important, it produces much better results-especially attheandM;resolutions required for screen display and for small type sizes on laserandM;printer output.andM;The rasterizer is very compact-about 35K of memory required for theandM;rasterizer itself It uses existing Type I Adobe fonts, which themselves areandM;exceptionally compact.andP;  (The Adobe Times Roman, for example, requires 27K ofandM;storage for 228 roman characters, and 106K for the full roman, italic, boldandM;and bold italic set-approximately 1/3 the storage required by theCompugraphicandM;Intellifont version of the same face.) Macintosh screen display.andP;  The firstandM;product implementation of the new rasterizer will be found in Adobe TypeandM;Manager for the Macintosh.andP;  In essence, this is an Adobe software packagethatandM;intercepts program calls to the Macintosh QuickDraw font drawing routines.andM;ATM checks to see if the font called for is available as an Adobe outline.andO;IfandM;so, it will use the ATM rasterizer to generate the character bitmaps requiredandM;for screen display.andP;  If not, it will pass the call on toandM;the regular Apple QuickDraw routines (which currently use bitmapped fonts).andM;Including the logic required to interface with QuickDraw, ATM occupiesandM;about 90K of Macintosh memory.andP;  In addition, the user will probably want toset    aside some memory to cache some font bitmaps so that ATM does not havetoandM;re-rasterize font size combinations you are using over and over again.andM;Adobe says that ATM-unlike Apple System 7 scalable fonts-will run in aandM;1-MB Mac.andP;  However, every release of the Apple System software has gottenandM;larger, and everything you add that takes up more memory leaves you lessandM;memory available for your application software.andP;  Like everything else, theandM;more processing power you have and the more memory you have, the better ATMandM;will run.andM;Appearance on the screen.andP;  We have not yet been able to make side-by-sideandM;comparisons with either the Apple/ Adobe bitmapped screen fonts currentlyusedandM;in the Macintosh or the the Apple outline font technology that will beandM;included in System 7.andP;  But the ATM screen fonts look pretty good.andP;  They areandM;legible even down to relatively small sizes, and they do a good job ofandM;preserving theandM;color&quot; and &quot;feel&quot; of the typeface.andM;There is, of course, the unavoidableandM;problem of rounding off the widths of screen characters to match the widthsofandM;the printer characters.andP;  This typically results in some uneven characterandM;spacingandM;some characters too far apart, others too close together).andP;  The problem isnotandM;new.andP;  It has been around ever since the first WYSIWYG screens.andM;Originally, the Macintosh &quot;solved&quot;  this problem by optimizing characterandM;spacing for screen display and forcing the spacing on hard copy output toandM;conform to this.andP;  This yields the most legible screen display at the expenseofandM;quality of hard copy output.andM;Later, Apple added provision for fractional pixel spacing of charactersandM;on the screen.andP;  In general, Macintosh publishing programs tend to optimizeforandM;hard copy output at the expense of character spacing for screen display,whileandM;office programs (word processors, spread-andM;sheets, etc.) stiff tend to favor spacing for best appearance on the screen.andM;The WriteNow word processor gives the user a choice, but fewandM;users knowandM;about it.andP;  Adobe may decide to offer a similar choice in ATM.andM;True wysiwyg.andP;  Within the limits of what QuickDraw can do (noandM;rotation, noandM;expanding/condensing of type), the characters displayed on the screen fromandM;ATM are truly what you will see on final output.andP;  This means, for example,andM;that it really is possible to make judgments about kerning of headlines andandM;appearance of a page on the Macintosh screen.andP;  For critical users, thisandM;should yield substantial reductions in trial-and-error output of LaserWriterandM;proofs and corresponding increases in productivity.andM;Performance.andP;  The current prototype software has not yet been tuned forspeed.andM;Adobe expects that the software it ships in October will rasterizeandM;approximately 50 characters per second when running on an unassistedandM;Macintosh II.andP;  This would be in the same ballpark as much of the competition.andM;By way of comparison, we have clocked Nimbus Q at a net speed (includingandM;disk accesses) of 63 cps when generating Palatino characters on a 20MHz'386andM;computer.andP;  Compugraphic claims that its new Bullet version of IntellifontwillandM;generate characters at 125 cps when running on a 16-MHz'386, assuming thatandM;all of the outlines required are already loaded into cache memory.andM;Although we have not made precise timings, the current version of ATM andandM;the current version of Intellifont appear to operate at approximately theandM;same speed when used to drive the HewlettPackard DeskWriter printer (seeandM;below).andM;User perceptions.andP;  We do not yet have a good feel for what all of this meansandM;for the user.andP;  It may depend heavily on how many face/size combinations youandM;have in your document, how powerful your computer is (a Macintosh Plus isandM;going to run a lot slower than a Mac 11), and how much cache memory youallocate for storage of character bitmaps.andM;Remember, of course, that you see the speed of the rasterizer only whenandM;you switch to a new font/point size combination that has not been alreadyandM;rasterized and stored in cache memory.andP;  If you are using characters that haveandM;previously been rasterized, the Mac will run at the same speed as it doeswhenandM;using bitmapped screen fonts derived from any other source.andM;Hard-copy output.andP;  In addition to screen display, ATM will also generate fontandM;bitmaps for QuickDraw printer output-including ImageWriter dot-matrixandM;printers, Hewlett-Packard DeskWriter ink-jet printers, and, we presume, theandM;Apple and General Computer QuickDraw laser printers.andM;ImageWriter users will be delighted to see hard copy output which finallyandM;exploits the resolution of their printers-and which, within the limits of theandM;printer resolution, corresponds exactly to the output they will get on aandM;PostScript laser printer or typesetter.andM;DeskWriter.andP;  We were particularly impressed with what ATM will mean for thenewandM;Hewlett-Packard DeskWriter ink-jet printer.andM;You will recall from our discussion of this device in our last issueandM;(Vol.andP;  3, No.andP;  11, page 22) that it is driven by rasterizing software whichandM;runs in the host Macintosh computer.andP;  Hewlett-Packard uses CompugraphicandM;Intellifont outline fonts.andP;  The basic package that comes with the machineandM;includes CG equivalents of the Times Roman, Helvetica, Courier and SymbolandM;faces used in the standard LaserWriter.andP;  An optional package add equivalentstoandM;the 22 additional faces built into the LaserWriter Plus.andM;Like the Apple ImageWriter, the DeskWriter is a QuickDraw priandM;nter.andP;  WhenandM;you output a  ob to the DeskWriter, the HP driver software checksandM;first to seeandM;if it has an Intellifont version of a font.andP;  If it does, it will generate theandM;required raster output from the Intellifont outline.andP;  If it does not, it willandM;pass the call to QuickDraw and output a smoothed version of the AppleandM;bitmapped screen font.andP;  As we noted in ourandM;original review, when it does this it notifies the user (via a message on theandM;Macintosh screen) that it has had to fall back to using bitmapped fonts.andM;Enter ATM.andP;  If you remove the Intellifont fonts from your system disk and in-andM;stall instead ATM and Adobe fonts, the HP driver will not find anyandM;Intellifont outlines to use and will pass the font calls to QuickDraw.andP;  AtandM;this point, ATM will intercept them and, where available, use Adobe outlineandM;fonts instead.andP;  As with the screen display, if there is no Adobe outlineandM;available, Apple bitmapped fonts will be used.andM;The benefits to this arrangement are considerable:andM;* DeskWriter output will be an almostandM;exact match for PostScript laser printerandM;output.andM;* The DeskWriter user has access to theandM;full library of Adobe fonts, not just CGandM;equivalents of the LaserWriter PlusandM;fonts.andM;* The quality of DeskWriter output isandM;improved.andP;  From what we have seenandM;thus far, we think that Adobe's ATMandM;DeskWriter output looks better thanandM;the Intellifont DeskWriter output.andM;* The user gets the benefit of true wysi-andM;wyg outline font display on his MacintoshandM;screen.andM;* Adobe fonts take up much less roomandM;than Intellifont fonts.andM;* Although we have not done extensiveandM;testing, printer throughput appears toandM;be about the same in both cases.andM;Pricing and availability.andP;  Adobe expects to start shipping ATM inOctober-wellandM;before Apple expects System 7 to be ready.andP;  A base package that includes ATMandM;and the 13 LaserWriter faces will sell for $99.andP;  There will either be anandM;add-on package that includes the additional 22 LaserWriter Plus faces or anandM;alternate package that includes ATM and aU 35 faces.andP;  Adobe will decide theandM;details while this issue is at the printer.andP;  We expect that the completeandM;package will cost between $200 and $300.andM;Adobe vs.andP;  Apple.andP;  It certainly looks as if Adobe will beat Apple into themarketandM;with scalable fonts for the Macintosh.andP;  Adobe brings some significantandM;advantages to the game:andM;*  Full font interchangeability withandM;Adobe PostScript devices.andP;  Exactly theandM;same fonts are used for screen display,andM;output on QuickDraw printers andandM;output on Adobe PostScript recorders.andM;This should be an important considerationandM;for anyone who wants to beandM;able to output to high-resolution Post-andM;Script devices or who expects to haveandM;a heterogeneous environment in whichandM;Macs, PCs and Unix workstations willandM;share common PostScript output devices.andM;* Immediate access to the largest libraryandM;of outline digitized fonts for desktopandM;output.andM;In addition, Adobe's head startandM;should give it substantial momentum by the time Apple gets SystemandM;7 into theandM;field.andM;Apple's counter.andP;  All things being equal, there is a strong argument that theandM;rational user will choose the Adobe technology rather than the AppleandM;technology.andP;  At the moment, it appears that he will be able to pick up theandM;entire Adobe PostScript world without any penalty on the QuickDraw side.andM;h But will all things really be equal?andP;  Apple strongly believesandM;that itsandM;Royal font technology will turn out to be better than the AdobeandM;technology.andM;It believes Royal will be faster and will produce better quality results onandM;screen and on hard copy output.andM;More important, the outline font format is only part of whatandM;Apple isandM;building into System 7.andP;  The Layout Manager routine which willandM;handle placingandM;characters on the screen promises to be very sophisticated.andP;  As we reportedandM;earlier (Vol.andP;  3, No.andP;  9, pages 6-8), Layout Manager will support suchandM;functions as on-the-fly character kerning.andM;Apple has not yet disclosed the details of Layout Manager toandM;Adobe.andP;  ItandM;therefore not clear what Adobe will have to do to make ATM workandM;with LayoutandM;Manager or if Adobe fonts contain enough information to support full LayoutManager functionality.andP;  Apple's options.andP;  Now that ATM is approaching themarket, Apple is going to have  to decide what it is going to do aboutRoyal/Layout Manager vs.andP;  ATM.andP;  It  appears to have three choices:andM;1.andP;  A &quot;closed&quot; Apple will regard Adobe as a threat and a competitor.andP;  As noted above, if he can get everything from Adobe he can get from Apple plusthe  advantages of being part of the wider Adobe PostScript world, therational user  will choose the Adobe font technology rather than the Apple.andM;If Apple fears this, it will continue to refuse to give Adobe information about Layout Manager so as to make it as difficult as possible for Adobe'sATM  to take advantage of the facilities of Layout Manager or, conceivably,for ATM  to even function with Layout Manager.andM;2.andP;  An &quot;open&quot; Apple would view ATM as something that enhances the  Macintoshplatform and encourage rather than discourage Adobe.andM;It would realize that as good as its own System 7 approach may be, it is essentially a closed architecture that may pose problems for users who haveto  operate in a heterogeneous environment in which they want to exchangeformatted  information between different kinds of computer systems.andP;  In thiscontext, the  Adobe solution offers an option that should make the Mac moreattractive to  users.andM;This, of coursce presumes that Apple thinks that Royal offers sufficient advantages that Apple can compete with Adobe in this arena.andP;  But if Appledoes  not believe this, why do we need another font format?andM;3.andP;  A &quot;devious&quot; Apple win decide that it docs not want to appear to be the &quot;bad guy&quot; who tries to lock Adobe out,   but that it still wants to give itsown Royal font format a head start in the  market.andM;The likely course in this case would be for Apple to give lip service to coopeeration ut to find reasons to delay giving Adobe information in order toslow Adobe down as much as possible.andM;Adobe had to expend a lot of effort to make sure ATM will be compatible withthe current Apple system software.andM;Without Apple's wining cooperation, it will have to spend a lot more to getitandM;to work with Layout Manager.andM;The test.andP;  We will be watching with interest to see what Apple decides to do.andM;As you have certainly gathered, we think that everyone (including Apple) isandM;better served if Apple cooperates with Adobe.andP;  We believe that it will.andM;There is, of course, a risk in this: If Adobe manages to offer everythingandM;that Apple promises, it is likely that the Adobe solution win win.andP;  But quiteandM;frankly, if Royal does not offer advantages to users, then Apple customers,andM;Apple itself and the industry at large would be better off if Apple got outofandM;the Macintosh font technology business and left it to Adobe.andP;  Clearly, AppleandM;believes that Royal does offer substantial advantages.andP;  We hope that it willandM;have the courage to act on this belief.andM;Microsoft.andP;  As our readers are well aware, Microsoft is in the process ofandM;choosing the font technology that it will include in Presentation Manager andandM;Windows.andP;  It is unlikely that it will choose to use the Adobe technology.andO;TheandM;result is likely to be a situation in the DOS and OS/2 world similar to thatandM;in the Macintosh world.andM;If Microsoft does not choose ATM as its font technology, we would expectandM;that Adobe will do a PC version of ATM for the same reason that it did a MacandM;version.andM;We do expect, however, that Microsoft and IBM will be more receptive toandM;this than Apple has been thus far.andP;  Even though there win be a preferred fontandM;technology built into Presentation Manager, we would be very surprised ifandM;Microsoft did not leave in the &quot;hooks&quot; that will allow PM to use otherandM;rasterizers as well.andM;Printers.andP;  Since most Adobe PostScript printers have the PostScriptinterpreterandM;in ROM, we do not expect the ATM rasterizer to be retrofitted to existingandM;PostScript printers.andP;  However, we are certain that it will be built intofuture generations of 300-dpi machines.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
