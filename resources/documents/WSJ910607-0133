The move marks the first step in a process that could leadto the establishment of a General Agreement on Tariffs andTrade adjudication to settle the four-year dispute betweenWashington and Brussels.</LP><TEXT>   Washington claims European production subsidies to thefour companies in the Airbus consortium violate GATT'sfair-trade rules. It says such state supports total nearly$20 billion and give Airbus an unfair advantage over BoeingCo. and McDonnell Douglas Corp., the two big U.S. aircraftmakers.   The EC says U.S. aircraft companies enjoy state support inthe form of spinoffs from defense contracts.   A GATT official said yesterday that the U.S. informed theGeneva-based forum last Friday that it planned bilateralconsultations with the EC. The talks are scheduled to takeplace within 60 days and may then go on to a GATTconciliation committee.   If this fails to resolve the dispute, the U.S. can requesta GATT dispute panel to rule whether the EC measures areillegal under GATT.   The Airbus consortium includes Aero-spatiale of France,British Aerospace PLC, Construcciones Aeronauticas S.A. ofSpain and Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm G.m.b.H. of Germany.</TEXT></DOC>
