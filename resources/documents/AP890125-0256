DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A month after Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. agreedto plead guilty to felony charges, federal prosecutors have revealedthe allegations include crooked dealings with disgraced stockspeculator Ivan F. Boesky and a defunct securities firm.   But the disclosure of the six specific mail and securities fraudcounts Tuesday still leaves unanswered questions:   _What will be required of the investment giant to keep its pleabargain, which includes an agreement to pay a records $650 millionin fines and restitution;   _When will Drexel actually plead guilty, and   _What effect will the agreement have on the fate of Drexel'sembattled ``junk bond'' chief, Michael Milken.   The charges against Drexel were revealed in a court documentknown as an information, which is presented to a judge or magistratewhen a defendant agrees to waive indictment and settle a casewithout going to trial.   A lawyer for Drexel entered a ``not guilty'' plea before U.S.Magistrate Nina Gershon, because only a judge can take a guilty pleato a felony.   U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani said Drexel's guilty plea wouldnot come until after the settlement is approved by the JusticeDepartment and the Securities and Exchange Commission.   Key details of the settlement spelling out Drexel'sresponsibilities concerning cooperation with investigators and otherissues was kept under seal at Drexel's request, however.   Giuliani said he believed the public had a right to know detailsof the agreement and he would ask a federal judge to unseal detailsof the settlement at a closed hearing today.   ``I cannot answer for Drexel why they want to keep it underseal,'' said Giuliani, who added: ``the public in general, but inparticular, the investing public, is entitled to the facts about thecase.''   In a statement, Drexel said it ``will not comment furtherregarding other criminal allegations that have been a part of theU.S. attorney's investigation.''   The government accused Drexel of criminal acts ranging frominsider trading to stock manipulation involving some recent majortakeover targets as well as Boesky and Princeton-Newport Partners,which liquidated after five of its top officials were indicted lastyear on racketeering charges.   In all, there were four counts of securities fraud and two ofmail fraud in the information.   ``There are no specific insider trading charges among the sixcounts enumerated,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney John K. Carroll,``but the information does describe the course of conduct betweenDrexel and the Boesky organization and Drexel and thePrinceton-Newport organization and in connection with them, theinformation does allege insider trading.''   Some of the charges also implicated a senior employee at Drexel'sHigh Yield and Convertible Bond Department in Beverly Hills, Calif.,identified only as ``John Doe.''   Giuliani said he was ``not permitted'' by federal rules toidentify the individual.   People familiar with the case concluded the employee was Milken,Drexel's senior junk bond financier who is expected to be indictedshortly on fraud and racketeering charges.   Giuliani declined to comment on any possible charges facingMilken, who has maintained he has done nothing wrong.   Five of the charges in the criminal case mirrored accusations ina civil case leveled against the firm and Milken in September by theSEC, which said they schemed with Boesky, the now-imprisoned stockspeculator who has snitched on many prominent securities figures inexchange for lenient treatment.   The sixth charge involved a transaction that allegedly defraudeda Drexel client.   ``Drexel manipulated securities prices, engaged in insidertrading and unlawfully facilitated merger and acquisitionactivities,'' said a statement from Giuliani's office.   ``Today's filing of an information charging Drexel BurnhamLambert is in accordance with the preliminary agreement reached withthe United States Attorney on Dec. 21, 1988,'' said Drexel'sstatement. ``We believe that this settlement is in the bestinterests of our firm, its employees and clients.''   The statement also said the settlement, when final, ``willprotect Drexel from further prosecution relating to the matterswhich are part of the U.S. attorney's office's continuinginvestigation.''   The charges accused Drexel of mail fraud and securities fraud inconnection with takeover-related transactions that included targetsFischbach Corp., MCA Inc., Harris Graphics Corp., Phillips PetroleumCo. and Stone Container Corp.   The firm also was accused of fraud in connection with atransaction in which the government said it conspired withPrinceton-Newport to cheat a Drexel client, C.O.M.B. Co.   Drexel is the fifth-largest Wall Street firm and one of the mostprofitable investment concerns in the country. It is a leader in the$175 billion market for ``junk bond'' securities, often used tofinance takeovers and the growth of small to medium sized companies.   The firm and Milken were implicated in extensive wrongdoing byBoesky after he turned state's evidence in late 1986. In December,Drexel began negotiating a plea deal with Giuliani's office in orderto avoid crippling charges of racketeering. Milken continues tomaintain his innocence.</TEXT></DOC>
