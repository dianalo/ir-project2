As predictedby band-structure considerations, the CDW modulation is observed to besubstantially localized on different chains for the separate CDW's. AT77 K where only the high-temperature CDW exists, a relatively weak modulationwith a single component along the b axis is observed. At 4.2 K the low-temperatureCDW contributes a much stronger {similar_to}4b{sub 0} x 2c{sub 0} superlatticemodulation.</TEXT></DOC>
