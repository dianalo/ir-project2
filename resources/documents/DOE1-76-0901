<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-76-0901 </DOCNO><TEXT>This patent describes an apparatus for shifting the phase of each of apair of phase-quadrature analog input signals, in at least one of a transmitterand a receiver of a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) system, comprising:first and second input means each for receiving a different one of apair of quadrature-phased analog-input signals A and B; first and secondoutput means each for providing a location at which an associated oneof a pair of phase-shifted analog output signals will be provided; meansfor shifting the phase of that one analog input signal received at theassociated one of each of the first and second input means by a substantiallysimilar phase angle in an identical one of four phase-shift incrementseach substantially equal to 90{sup 0}; and means for programmably establishingthe control signal to provide a desired phase-shift angle for both ofthe pair of signals in the shifting means.</TEXT></DOC>
