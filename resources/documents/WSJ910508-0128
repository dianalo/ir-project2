His organization, which calls itself the MexicanEcological Movement, is opening 25 oxygen booths in localparks and malls. At $1.60 per minute under the mask, Mexicanscan get a little relief.</LP><TEXT>   If that sounds expensive, at least it's less elitist thanthe home oxygen tanks now in vogue among Mexicans with money.Mr. Cipres envisions his breathing boutiques &quot;alongsideelectric rocking horses. We want them to be very natural.&quot;   Nowhere on earth does foul air seem so normal as in thiscity of 19 million people, three million cars and 32,000industrial polluters. Dust, lead and chemicals made MexicoCity's air unsafe to breathe 302 days last year. &quot;It's aculture of contamination,&quot; says physician Victor Sanchez, aleading respiratory specialist. In the third-grade art classat the Valentin Zamora School, children don't ask for bluepaint to compose their cityscapes. Gray is the color ofchoice.   But, barely visible through the smog as thick as&quot;gazpacho,&quot; a new way of life is emerging. It's clear thatthere's something in the air when the Mexico City Assemblyseriously debates importing tricycles or rickshaws to replacesmoke-belching taxis.   In offices, Mexico City pollution has proved stronger thaneven the vaunted Japanese work ethic: It's compulsory foremployees at the Japanese Chamber of Commerce here to spend45 days a year on vacations outside the capital. &quot;All thattime away from work -- it isn't what you would call a naturalsituation,&quot; says a chamber official.   Nor is the home any refuge from the obsession. That MexicoCity housewives do shopping at hearthside kaffeeklatschesisn't new or unusual -- except that they are buying from anair-filter company called Bionaire, rather than a plasticcontainer outfit called Tupperware. The meetings are &quot;bigsocial events,&quot; says Angelica Olivares, a saleswoman. &quot;Weshop, and talk about our children, clothes, travel andbronchitis treatments.&quot;   The latter topic is an exceedingly rich mine, seeing ashow new chapters in preventive medicine are written each dayin Mexico City. Ruben Shturman, a respiratory specialist, dida pioneering study suggesting that Mexico City joggers werethree times as likely to have bronchial problems as sedentaryfolks. Thus, he often finds himself committing the medicalheresy of telling patients to take it easy. Dr. Shturmanhimself does what might be called the Mexico City workout: Heruns on a treadmill in a sealed room with the air filter onfull blast.   Pollution lends an absurdist air to everyday conversation.Listen to the middleclass women talking in the waiting roomof their ear, nose and throat doctor:   &quot;The pollution would stop if they blasted some dynamite upthere,&quot; says Adriana Lara Gonzalez, pointing out the windowtoward the volcanoes ringing the city. But it's a vaingesture. Because of the haze, they can't actually see thevolcanoes. And that just proves Mrs. Lara's point: &quot;Spendwhatever is necessary to blow the volcanoes up]&quot; she says.   But to Mercedes Arroyo, sitting next to Mrs. Lara on thesofa, throwing money at the pollution problem is the lastthing to do. During the same 10-year period in whichparticulate matter in the air in her neighborhood increasedfivefold, Mexico's currency was devalued to 3,000 pesos perdollar, from 23. All those dirty bills have poisoned theatmosphere. &quot;Money passes through more dirty hands thananything else,&quot; says Mrs. Arroyo, cringing.   A third woman, listening in, adds her two cents' worth:She questions the wisdom of the recent government edictcreating nonsmoking sections in restaurants. If merelybreathing the air of Mexico City is equivalent to smoking twopacks a day, she conjectures, perhaps moderate smoking mightactually filter out the really dangerous particles one wouldotherwise be inhaling.   The problems of &quot;Makesicko City,&quot; as novelist CarlosFuentes has called it, have been mounting for 50 years, eversince it became national policy to centralize government andindustry here. But the really sulfurous smog used to beconfined to the winter months, when cold air produced thermalinversions that trapped pollutants. Thanks to growth fueledin part by the arrival each day of some 2,000 newcomers fromthe countryside, that's no longer true. Now, &quot;capitalinos&quot;can't breathe easy the rest of the year either.   Preparing to start a public-relations job at a hotel here,Mayte Lopez planned to arrive from her native Spain at whatshe thought was the end of the smog season. As her planebegan its descent toward Mexico City, she eagerly leafedthrough a guidebook. &quot;I can't wait to see the city,&quot; Ms.Lopez said. But this is one city visitors smell before theysee. (&quot;It smells like a gas station,&quot; Ms. Lopez observed.)And after a few weeks of experiencing &quot;airsickness&quot; in MexicoCity, she took a new job, this time in London.   Indeed, trying to solve the pollution problem while Mexicois mired in debt has been, in the words of a former mayor,&quot;like repairing an airplane in flight.&quot; The government easedpollution, on the cheap, last year by telling people not todrive one day a week. Each car had an assigned day. But whenthe &quot;No Driving Today&quot; program was permanently extended, manypeople here bought a second old heap.   This year, the government is spending more money andcracking down on industrial polluters. In recent weeks, morethan 200 factories have been shuttered, including a hugestate-run oil refinery. Mexico has emissions standardscomparable to those in the U.S., but they have never beenrigorously enforced.   Within companies, the crackdown seems to have raisedconsciousness. Some employers are contracting to haveworkers' respiratory systems tested periodically. &quot;We havemandatory testing of car-exhaust systems, so why don't we dothe same for people?&quot; says Dr. Sanchez, the respiratoryspecialist. He thinks there should be a spirometer in everygarage (a device, complete with mouthpiece and printout, formeasuring the breathing capacity of the lungs).   One might expect people to be leaving Mexico City fortheir health. Well, they are and they aren't.   Steve Knaebel, president of Mexican operations for CumminsEngine Co. in Columbus, Ind., didn't need a breath test totell him that a decade here was just about enough. He nolonger even thinks of exercising outdoors. His teen-age son'scase of bronchitis dragged on for six weeks last winter. Fourdifferent antibiotics wouldn't knock out his wife's eyeinfection.   So Mr. Knaebel is thinking of moving corporate offices tothe provincial city of San Luis Potosi, four hours north ofhere, where Cummins has its factory. But there's a hitch:About half his corporate staff of 70 wouldn't dream ofleaving Mexico City, even to save their jobs.   The city &quot;has a fatal attraction,&quot; says real-estate agentRafael Harrari. &quot;Say what you will, but there's no other citylike it.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
