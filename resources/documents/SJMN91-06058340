The buyers were dividedinto two groups: 719 buyers of detached homes and 278 buyers of attachedhousing such as townhouses.;    In each group, the largest segment expectedannual value increases of only 1 percent to 5 percent -- far below thedouble-digit annual increases common in many areas a few years ago. The modestexpectations of 1 percent to 5 percent appreciation came from 46 percent ofdetached-home buyers and 48 percent of townhouse buyers.;    Other largesegments, including 36 percent of detached-home buyers and 39 percent oftownhouse buyers, expected relatively modest annual appreciation of 6 percentto 10 percent.;    The very optimistic buyers, representing 18 percent ofdetached-home buyers and 13 percent in the attached-home group, expectedannual gains in value of more than 10 percent.;    Many economists point outthat housing can be a first-rate investment even if value gains are very low.For example, homeowners gain tax advantages by deducting mortgage interestwhen calculating federal income tax.;    Most buyers also have down paymentsof 20 percent or less, making small gains in total value proportionately largewhen compared with the actual cash invested.;    Caution in applyinginvestment criteria appears to be the best approach in the current market.Some homes bought in the hot seller's market a few years ago sell today atlosses and housing values continue to decline in some areas.;    The mostprudent buyers today will look for homes that they feel they will enjoyoccupying for a reasonably long period of time regardless of whether there isa significant increase in value.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  GENE AUSTIN, Knight-Ridder News Service  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Peninsula/AM  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910227  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  418  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday February 27, 199100058340,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
