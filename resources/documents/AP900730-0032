Police said today that the attack may have been carried out by atraveling gang of supporters of the National Front, which advocatesthe expulsion of racial minorities from Britain.   The attack in the northern city of Manchester was linked withtwo others within the last six weeks, at Edmonton in north Londonand in Leeds, Yorkshire. In the Edmonton case, the words, ``We willrise again,'' were painted on gravestones.   Police estimated the damage at $128,000 from the Manchestervandalism, which police said occurred late Saturday or earlySunday. They did not disclose what the slogans were.   ``It is a terrible thing to think there are people who would dothis to the resting places of the dead,'' said Rabbi JacobRubinstein in Manchester.   ``We are extremely concerned to think that, in light of what hashappened to other cemeteries, these people are crawling out fromunder stones again,'' he said.   On Saturday, vandals in Stuttgart, West Germany, damaged morethan 60 gravestones in a Jewish cemetery and spray-painted themwith Nazi symbols.   More than 60 gravestones were desecrated, police said. Nazisymbols and slogans like ``Jews Out'' and ``The Gassing NeverHappened'' were spray-painted on some stones, they said.   Police said they suspected right-wing extremists for the damage,estimated at more than $125,000.   Two weeks earlier, unidentified vandals caused similar damage ata gravesite for Nazi victims in Tuebingen, about 30 miles south ofStuttgart. A similar attack occurred recently in Carpentras inFrance.   In Paris today police said about 30 graves were desecrated at acemetery at a catholic church near southern Toulouse. Graffiti atthe cemetery _ which was not Jewish _ included ``Death to Jesus''and ``Down with the clergy.''   Since the Carpentras desecration in May, there has been somesort of cemetery vandalism almost weekly in France, much of it atnon-Jewish cemeteries and police believe most has been the work oflocal children.</TEXT></DOC>
