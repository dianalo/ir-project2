But the Professional Lawn Care Association says the industry iswell-regulated and takes proper care to use products safely.   The report issued by Public Citizen, a non-profit consumer groupfounded by Ralph Nader, said 12 of the 40 pesticides most oftenused by commercial lawn care firms are suspected human carcinogens.   Twenty-one of the pesticides can cause long-term health problemslike birth defects, liver, kidney or nerve damage; 20 can causeshort-term ailments similar to flu; and 36 have caused eye, skin orthroat irritation, the group said.   James Brooks, spokesman for the lawn care industry group, saidthe study was ``old news'' and based mostly on isolated incidents.   ``We have to be registered and certified in most states,''Brooks said. ``We are regulated. We use chemicals as recommended onthe label. If you follow the procedures and directions and allthat, then they are not going to cause any undue health problems.''   Dr. Barry Troutman, director of education for the lawnassociation, said scientific evidence indicates the products don'tcause adverse health effects when used as directed by theEnvironmental Protection Agency.   He criticized the study for being too ``anecdotal'' and not``science-based.''   The study, written by Laura Weiss, calls on the EPA to:   _Ban lawn care pesticides suspected of causing cancer.   _Conduct a comprehensive exposure study for all lawn carechemicals, speed up testing for neurotoxic effects of allpesticides and their inert ingredients and take regulatory actionto protect consumers.   _Require lawn care companies to provide customers withgovernment information on the known and potential health effects oflawn care pesticides.   _Ensure that federal agencies take decisive action against lawncare companies that make false or misleading claims about thesafety of their products.   _Appropriate funds for programs that promote use of non-chemicalpest control systems.   Alicia Tenuta, spokeswoman for the EPA, said the agency had notseen the study and could not comment on it.</TEXT></DOC>
