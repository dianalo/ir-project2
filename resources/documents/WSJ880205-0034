The problem: It may reap big gains for Uncle Sam as well as the company's shareholders.    Because of the timing and structure, it's expected that the Chicago-based railroad and energy concern's giant payout will be almost entirely taxable for many shareholders -- in contrast with most such dividends, which are set up as a non-taxable return of capital.    Moreover, according to Santa Fe officials, complicated trading rules related to the dividend mean that sellers of Santa Fe stock, starting Monday and continuing through Feb. 16, won't be able to keep the dividend but will be taxed on it nonetheless. As reported earlier, the dividend is payable in two parts: $25 a share in cash on Feb. 16 and $5 in 16% subordinated debentures on March 1.    A telephone hotline at Santa Fe, staffed by 20 people, has been swamped with calls for days. And many callers got little but a busy signal or time on &quot;hold.&quot; &quot;I couldn't get through (and) as far as I'm concerned, you could drop a bomb on (Santa Fe headquarters),&quot; fumed Joel Price, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Inc.    At Bear Stearns andamp; Co., accounting analysts prepared an elaborate four-page internal memo on the dividend's tax implications and still fretted about some details. &quot;I've gotten opinions from 26 different people,&quot; said Janet Pegg, one of the firm's accounting analysts.    Santa Fe stock, meanwhile, slid 62.5 cents a share to $43 on heavy volume of 2.5 million shares in New York Stock Exchange consolidated trading. The stock was off as much as $1 for much of the day and has slid from a price of $46.50 on Jan 26, when the payout was announced.    Much of the stock's weakness seemed to be related to concerns about the dividend's tax impact, analysts said.    As reported earlier, Santa Fe has been pursued by La Jolla, Calif.-based Henley Group Inc. and Toronto-based Olympia andamp; York Developments Ltd., with which Santa Fe signed a peace agreement last Sunday. Henley, a manufacturing, chemicals, engineering and financial services company with a 15.7% stake in Santa Fe, has said it will pursue a proxy battle for seats on Santa Fe's board.    Analysts have faulted Santa Fe for rushing to pay a dividend as a takeover defense at a time when, because of anticipated profits from asset sales, the tax impact is greatest.    But Santa Fe officials say the dividend has nothing to do with unwanted suitors. &quot;We picked (the dividend timing) because the restructuring program had terminated and we were in a position to pay it,&quot; said Orval M. Adam, Santa Fe's vice president and chief financial officer.    Mr. Adam said the other complication of the dividend -- the forthcoming period when holders may be taxed on a dividend they can't keep -- likewise couldn't be avoided and arises from differences between Big Board requirements and Internal Revenue Service rules.    According to Big Board rules, big special dividends must take place in four steps.    But nothing in the material sent holders by Santa Fe explains this. In Santa Fe's case, the stock has traded since Monday with so-called &quot;due bills&quot; that mean the right to the dividend has been attached to the stock. The company's record date for the payout is today and payment of the cash portion is set for Feb. 16. However, the stock doesn't actually trade &quot;ex-dividend&quot; until Feb 17.    The practical effect of this sequence is that holders who sell starting Monday, through Feb. 16, will receive the dividend but will have to return it to their broker -- who then passes it on to the stock purchaser. But, because the seller actually received the dividend, he or she will be taxed on it and then, for tax purposes, will reduce the amount of the sale price by $30 a share -- the amount of the dividend. </TEXT></DOC>
