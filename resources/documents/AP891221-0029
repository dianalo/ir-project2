Peru withdrew its U.S. ambassador, and the Organization ofAmerican States met in emergency session Wednesday following thepre-dawn mililtary assault aimed at deposing and seizing Panamanianstrongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.   The OAS refused to recognize the new U.S.-installed government'srepresentative, and instead considered a resolution condemning theU.S. action.   El Salvador's U.S.-backed government was the only one in LatinAmerican to clearly support the move.   In La Paz, the bomb went off around 8:30 p.m. Wednesday,destroying windows at the embassy and surrounding offices. Noinjuries were reported.   Police at the scene said there were no suspects, but the ArmedLiberation Front of Zarate Willka, a radical leftist group, claimedresponsibility.   ``Death to the Yankee invader; our hatred is unplacable and thewar will be until death,'' the group said in a statement releasedjust after the bombing. ``We are fighting against aggression andfor the sovereignty of our people.''   The group has been accused of killing two Mormon missionariesfrom the United States in May and has been linked to an attempt tokill then-U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz during an August1988 visit.   Peru's president, Alan Garcia, said he was pulling hisambassador from Washington in protest. He said a drug summitscheduled for Feb. 15 with Bush and other Latin American presidentsin Cartagena, Colombia, should be postponed as a result of theinvasion.   Venezuela also criticized the move, but said in a communiquethat lack of an ``effective and firm'' response by Latin Americannations to human rights violations and constitutional norms byPanama's government had made it necessary.   In Nicaragua, President Daniel Ortega said the invasionthreatened his Central American country, and placed troops onmaximum alert. Soviet-built tanks rumbled through Managua, at least20 large howitzers were positioned in the capital and Red Beretspecial forces went to the international airport.   ``In addition to constituting a flagrant trampling of thesovereignty and territorial integrity of Panama, it is a threat tothe peace and security of all Latin America, Central America andespecially constitutes a serious threat to Nicaragua,'' Ortega saidin a communique read on Voice of Nicaragua radio.   Thousands of Cubans protested the invasion by rallying outsidethe Havana building that houses the U.S. interests section, theofficial Cuban news agency Prensa Latina said. The United Stateshas no embassy in Havana.   Fidel Castro's government called on the world to unite indenouncing the United States, the agency said.   President Jose Sarney of Brazil said in a television interviewthat the invasion was a ``step backward in internationalrelations.''   Argentina offered aid to Panamanians and said it ``trulydeplores what is happening.'' It called for immediate removal ofthe American troops but also described Noriega as an obstacle todemocracy.   Chile, Mexico, Uruguay and Ecuador also deplored the U.S. move.   Colombia did not directly comment on the invasian. But EnriquePennalosa, its United Nations ambassador who also chairs the U.N.Security Council, said, ``Colombia, as a matter of principle,rejects any armed intervention against a sovereign country.''   El Salvador's government said the United States ``was using itslegitimate right of defense.''   ``This type of actions could permit the Panamanian people toidentify with a democratic process, to reestablish an electedgovernment,'' said Vice President Francisco Merino.   Honduras appeared to give qualified support to the U.S. move,saying its government ``laments the declaration of a state of warin Panama and the violent acts taken against American military andcivilians.''   ``Honduras equally laments that the U.S. government saw itnecessary to take military action, moving away from the principleof non-intervention, as an extreme measure to guarantee thesecurity of thousands of its citizens residing in Panama,'' theForeign Ministry statement added.   Costa Rican Foreign Minister Rodrigo Madrigal said in astatement that his country regretted the U.S. use of force to``bring about an end to the crisis caused by the despoticgovernment of Gen. Noriega,'' but hopes that ``peace returns toPanama with a quick restoration of a democratic government.''</TEXT></DOC>
