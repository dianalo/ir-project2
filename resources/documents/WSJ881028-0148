The Ministry of International Trade and Industry charged earlier this year that Kyokuto Shokai Co. shipped electronic measuring equipment to China in 1985 and 1986 that could be used in testing nuclear explosions, fine-tuning radar and detecting submarines. The equipment was among exports restricted by the government under rules based on those of the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls, a Paris-based international body that regulates trade with communist countries.    Japan increased its scrutiny of high-technology exports to communist countries following the disclosure of sales of militarily sensitive equipment to the Soviet Union in 1983 and 1984 by a Toshiba Corp. unit. That revelation embarrassed the Japanese government and resulted in U.S. sanctions against Toshiba.    Convicted in the Kyokuto case were Yoshikazu Ono, a former executive director of the company, and Teruko Takeuchi, former chief of the company's trade department. Mr. Ono was sentenced to one year in prison and Mr. Takeuchi to eight months. The company was fined two million yen ($16,000). The illegal sales totaled 34 million yen. </TEXT></DOC>
