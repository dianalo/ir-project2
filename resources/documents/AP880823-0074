The Western diplomat said he saw more than 50,000 people marchpeacefully through downtown streets chanting anti-governmentslogans. It was the second major demonstration in the capital in asmany days.   ``Down with Socialism!'' and ``Welcome Democracy!'' shoutedabout 2,000 demonstrators outside the U.S. Embassy, said thediplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity.   In Mandalay, Burma's second largest city, some 200,000 peopletook part in anti-government demonstrations, Japan's Kyodo newsservice said.   The diplomat in Rangoon said soldiers withdrew from the downtownarea this morning and the crowd swelled enormously with doctors andnurses in their uniforms, artists, writers, and lawyers joining thestudents, Buddhist monks, and other people who have been rallyingfor an end to 26 years of authoritarian rule.   ``The government seems to have been reduced to its leaders andits troops,'' the diplomat said of a similar protest Monday.   Today's demonstration was the largest in Rangoon since bloodyrioting Aug. 8-12 forced Sein Lwin's resignation after 17 days inpower. Maung Maung, the attorney general, assumed power Friday asthe country's first civilian leader in a quarter century.   Protesters have continued rallies calling for the end of theexclusive rule of the Burma Socialist Program Party, amilitary-dominated autocracy whose rigid policies have turned oneof Southeast Asia's richest nations into one of the world's poorest.   On Monday, hundreds of thousands of people filled the streets ofRangoon, Mandalay, the second-largest city, and other towns inresponse to student calls for protests and a nationwide generalstrike.   Some demonstrators in Rangoon tried to march to the Sule Pagoda,a rallying point for protest, but were peacefully stopped bybarbed-wire and other barricades and some of the three divisions oftroops deployed in the capital, diplomats said.   Diplomats said Monday's show of military force in the capitalreflected the government's position that while accommodatingdemands for significant economic reforms, it would not institutepolitical changes that would erode its power.   The Western diplomat said the demonstrations present authoritieswith a dilemma: the demonstrations will mushroom if they do not useforce to contain them, but force also brings the distinctpossibility of violence like that which led to the resignation SeinLwin.   By official count, 112 people were killed in Rangoon and 267wounded as security forces repeatedly opened fire to disperse thetens of thousands who marched against the hardline former armygeneral.   Since Sein Lwin's Aug. 12 resignation, there have been noreports of violence in the rallies and the government has indicatedit will be much more tolerant of open dissent.   More than 500 people arrested during the rioting have been freedby the new government. Among those still held are Aung Gyi, thecountry's leading dissident, and Sein Win, the Burma correspondentof The Associated Press, both arrested in a sweep in Rangoon July29-30.   AP President and General Manager Louis D. Boccardi sent a telexto Maung Maung today urging Sein Win's release.   ``It is our strongly felt hope that one of the first acts ofyour new administration will be the release of our correspondent,''Boccardi said in the telex. He said Sein Win, 66, has worked forthe AP for two decades and there was no indication he was involvedin anti-government activities, as authorities have claimed.   On Monday, a man claiming to represent 16 Burmese universitystudent unions said the coalition's president, Maung Maung Kwaw,had come to Bangkok seeking weapons from rebels fighting theBurmese government.   Also Monday, the Karen National Union, one of the strongestethnic-based guerrilla groups fighting the Burmese government forgreater autonomy, issued a statement in Bangkok declaring supportfor the students and calling on foreign nations to halt aid to thegovernment until it ends one-party rule.   Burma has been in turmoil since September, when universitystudents rioted in the country's most serious unrest since 1974.They were protesting the government's voiding of 60 percent of thecurrency, a move that dashed savings and hopes in a nation whoseaverage per capita income is less than $200.   Demonstrations, increasingly focused on political demands,occurred in March and June, and Sein Lwin is said to havepersonally ordered them brutally suppressed.   Rioting resumed in late July after Sein Lwin succeeded Ne Win,who had ruled since leading a 1962 coup toppled democracy.   The demonstrations became bloody when troops fired on crowds andsome protesters fought back. Diplomats believe the death toll wasmuch higher than official figures.</TEXT></DOC>
