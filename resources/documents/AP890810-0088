The resolution, adopted in a voice vote Wednesday by the459-member House of Delegates at the ABA's annual meeting, said theABA was acting ``in the interest of preserving intact the right tofreedom of speech and expression.''   The ABA also said it opposes any federal legislation making it acrime to desecrate the American flag as a political protest.   At the same time, the ABA declared the flag a ``revered nationalsymbol that ought to be treated with great respect by all citizensof the United States of America.''   The resolution is in response to calls by many, includingPresident Bush, for a constitutional amendment against defiling theflag.   That call came after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a Texascase in June that flag-burning is protected under the FirstAmendment guarantee of free speech.   A report by an ABA task force supporting the resolution quotedthe 18th century French philosopher Voltaire: ``I disapprove ofwhat you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.''</TEXT></DOC>
