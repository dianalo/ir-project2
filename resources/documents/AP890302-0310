The economic impact of those scenarios would be felt deeply inFlorida and across the gamut of 118 cities where Eastern operates inthe United States, the Caribbean and Latin America.   Eastern employs around 31,200 people, including 10,200 at itsMiami headquarters, 6,700 in Atlanta and 3,200 in New York. In SouthFlorida alone, the airline spent $541.2 million last year onsalaries and other employee benefits, and $11.1 million on fees atthree airports.   As a strike deadline against Eastern of 12:01 a.m. EST Saturdayloomed, federal mediators expressed some hope for a settlement ofthe contract dispute between the money-losing airline and itsmilitant Machinists union.   President Bush still was weighing whether to step in and avertthe impending strike, as the National Mediation Board hasrecommended.   If there is a strike of more than a few days, ``That will be theend of Eastern as we know it,'' said Louis Marckesano, an airlineanalyst at Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. in Philadelphia.   His warning reflects the assessment of many analysts and otherobservers.   Eastern recently reported a record net loss of $335.4 million in1988, nearly double its $181.7 million loss the year before. Revenuedropped to $3.8 billion from $4.4 billion in 1987.   The airline has a crushing $2.5 billion or so in debt.   ``It's obviously a situation that's heading fast for the edge ofthe cliff ... I see the prospect of bankruptcy as a real potentialoutcome here,'' Farrell Kupersmith, a financial consultant to theAir Line Pilots Association, recently told a gathering of analysts.   Kupersmith, an associate managing partner of the Touche Ross andamp;Co. accounting firm, represented creditors of Continental Airlinesafter that carrier was put into bankruptcy in September 1983 byTexas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo. Texas Air, Lorenzo'sHouston-based holding company, owns Eastern and Continental.   After the bankruptcy filing, the steely-tough Lorenzorestructured Continental and slashed the number of employees toaround 4,000 from 12,500.   Several observers believe an Eastern bankruptcy could follow aseries of events, notably sales of assets such as planes, airportgates and landing rights. After the assets had been stripped off,they suggest, Lorenzo could then put the remaining ``shell'' companyunder protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcylaws.   Lorenzo would have a tougher time putting Eastern into Chapter 11and sacking employees than he did with Continental _ but he couldstill do it. As a result of amendments to the bankruptcy laws passedin 1985, the Texas Air chief would first have to negotiate furtherwith the Eastern unions and demonstrate that he had no otheralternative.   ``I don't see bankruptcy as being an immediate possibility,''said Paul Karos, who follows the industry for First Boston Corp.``It's a very last resort.''   Another possible scenario is a takeover by outsiders, somethingthe Eastern unions have been trying to engineer for some time.   Takeover strategist Carl Icahn, head of Trans World AirlinesInc., has been lurking in the wings for months as a potentialacquirer of Eastern and is still there, according to observers andunion sources. Icahn may be hoping to pick up what remains ofEastern at a fire-sale price, analysts suggest.   Icahn has said publicly that Eastern, with its domestic routes,would fit nicely as a feeder into TWA's international network.   Other investor groups remain interested in Eastern, the sourcessay, although neither they nor Icahn has made a formal offer.   Selling Eastern as an integral unit is Lorenzo's ``ace in thehole,'' analyst Marckesano said.</TEXT></DOC>
