The Senate was in session until midnight each of thefirst four days I was there. I began to think that perhaps I had made an errorin judgment in accepting this appointment, and I knew I had made a greatmistake the following Monday. Less than seven days after I entered the Senate,a filibuster occurred. You know what that means. A controversial issue -- oneside wants a vote, one side wants to prevent a vote, and the result isround-the-clock sessions. In this case, we were in session for four dayswithout a moment's break. We came into session on a Tuesday morning at 7 andstayed in session for four consecutive days.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  TOUGH CHOICE: A SENATE COT OR LIZ TAYLOR  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Commentary  </MEMO><TEXT>     Now, at that time, I didn't know any better. I was new and naive. I thoughtI could learn something listening to a Senate debate. So I got there at 7 inthe morning, took my seat in the Senate chamber, looked around and wassurprised to see that I was the only person there. After a while, two othersenators came in and began really just killing time. It can't even charitablybe described as a debate. And after several hours of this, I thought aboutleaving, but since I was the only person there, each speaker looked directlyat me as he was speaking.;    Finally, they called for a vote on a proceduralmatter. In the Senate, that's what you do when you want to kill a little time.A bell rings very loudly and within 15 minutes, each senator must personallycome to the Senate floor and cast his or her vote.;    The bell rang. The backdoor opens and in a little while, into the Senate chamber poured the other 97senators. They all cast their votes and they left, including the two guys whohad been arguing. I stayed in my chair, not knowing what else to do, andpretty soon two other guys came in and this process repeated itself all day,all night for 24 consecutive hours, without one moment's pause. I remained inmy seat in the Senate, doing what I thought was the nation's business.;    Itwas 7 the next morning, I was very tired, haggard, hungry. I noticed that ontheir occasional trips in to vote, the other senators didn't look so bad. So Isaid to the clerk, 'Wherever they're going, whatever they're doing, that'swhere I'd like to go and that's what I'd like to do.';    So the clerk said,'No problem, Senator, come with me.' He took me by the arm and led me aroundbehind the Senate chamber into a room much smaller than this where, to myamazement, I saw set up 100 narrow canvas folding cots of the type you see inemergency shelters and there, lying there in their clothes, were the othermembers of the United States Senate.;    It was very crowded, people comingand going, and the clerk said to me, 'Senator, there's a cot right there inthe middle of the room, you'd better grab that one.' So I went to go to it butthere were no aisles, so I had to climb over other senators to get there. Thatwas actually very exciting because it was the closest I'd ever been until thattime to such famous people.;    I climbed right over Howard Baker, and thatwas not easy to do, I'll tell you. And there was Ted Kennedy and that wasbefore Ted went on a diet, and he posed a formidable obstacle.;    Finally, Iget over all these guys and I get down on that cot and lie there thinkingabout what a terrible mistake I'd made accepting this position, wished I couldgo back to being a federal judge but knew I couldn't, so I did what we alltend to do in such circumstances. I lapsed into self-pity and I was lyingthere wallowing in self-pity when I rolled over on this cramped, uncomfortablecot and I saw next to me, just a few inches away, the face of Senator JohnWarner of Virginia.;    At that time, he was married to Elizabeth Taylor. So Ilooked at him and I thought, Who am I to feel sorry for myself? I thought,Here's a guy who could be home, legally in bed with Elizabeth Taylor and he'sspending the night with me.;    And it reminded me of what we all know buttend to forget, and that is, no matter how bad off you've got it there'salways someone who's got it worse.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Knight-Ridder News Service  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910731  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  7B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  824  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday July 31, 199100213171,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
