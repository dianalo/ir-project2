A public announcement, posted on bulletin boards once festoonedwith the posters of the student-led pro-democracy movement, saidXiong Dayong, 22, had broken regulations banning unauthorizedgatherings.   With no diploma and an expulsion on his record, Xiong probablywill have difficulty finding work.   The notice, dated July 25, said Xiong, a fourth-year student ofChinese and a member of the Communist Party's Youth League,``incited other students to cause trouble by breaking martial lawrestrictions.''   It also accused Xiong of being a ``known criminal,'' stealingthree bicycles this summer and causing a drunken brawl last year.   On July 23, 300 to 400 students sang and beat pots and pans tomourn classmates killed June 3-4, when troops moved into Beijing tocrush the pro-democracy movement.   The students said they held the demonstration because they feltoppressed by ideological study classes they were forced to attendfollowing the crackdown and because some of them were refusedpermission to join the work units they were assigned to.   Most college graduates in China are assigned jobs by thegovernment.   Most of the 32,000 graduates from 80 universities and collegesin Beijing this year have been accepted by their assigned units,the official Xinhua news agency reported today.   The report said more than 1,000 graduates, however, had notfound appropriate jobs, in part because some companies had droppedplans to accept hundreds of students.   The report did not say whether the refusals were due topolitical considerations arising from the pro-democracydemonstrations, which began in April and were initiated and led bystudents from Beijing universities.   Also today, Chinese newspapers said the government announced itwould inspect the nation's 14.5 million private businesses in a bidto recover almost $5 billion in revenues lost through tax evasion.   The State Taxation Bureau will check the books and taxregistrations of private industrial, commercial and serviceenterprises in August and September for signs of tax evasion orother illegal activities, newspapers reported.   Tax bureau director Jin Xin said illegal businesses would beclosed and illegal income confiscated.   The government also is cracking down on corrupt tax collectors,who are now prohibited from accepting gifts from tax-free andtax-reduced businesses to help ``ensure an honest and cleangovernment,'' the official Xinhua news agency said.   The restrictions are part of a national anti-corruption drivetriggered by the student democracy movement, which included demandsfor an end to official corruption.</TEXT></DOC>
