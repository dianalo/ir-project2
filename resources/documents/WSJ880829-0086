This new provision of the Internal Revenue Code was enacted in 1986 but is not yet in effect. Benefit specialist Mercer Meidinger Hansen calls it the &quot;most challenging&quot; welfare benefit legislation ever faced by most companies, on a par with ERISA.    MMH also calls it a case of Congress dropping &quot;an atomic bomb on a suspect anthill -- and missing the anthill.&quot; That's an apt metaphor. It is another example of the class-warfare legislation that creeps into so much of what Congress produces these days. Its ostensible purpose is to ensure that the Chiefs won't be treated substantially better than the Indians when employee benefits are passed out. But the upshot, by most estimates, will be enormous new administrative costs for employers -- including government and non-profit institutions. Many workers face reduced benefits or higher taxes. Incentives to provide new benefits will be reduced.    Section 89 sets complex new requirements for tax exemption of employee benefits. It was designed by bureaucrats at Treasury and slipped into the 1986 reform at the last moment by staff moles of House and Senate tax committees. Treasury's interest was in trying to cadge another $350 million in revenues over three years, a yield that will be pulverized by compliance costs. The moles were just doing what comes naturally, planting a micromanagement time bomb in another massive piece of legislation.    Section 89 is an administrative nightmare. It applies to all employee welfare benefits. Employers, to learn whether their benefits qualify for tax exemption, will have to calculate &quot;values&quot; of such things as cafeteria subsidies, travel accident insurance and employee discounts. Corporations will have to do this company-wide, taking into account the different sets of benefits in different plants, negotiated by different unions. Single employee and family benefits must be treated separately, which means probing each family situation where a plan for one spouse might cover the other. There will be separate calculations for different &quot;lines of business&quot; with much confusion over which employee is in which line. Some large companies will have, in effect, 600 to 700 separate benefit plans to test for qualification.    The point is to determine whether what the law calls &quot;non-highly compensated employees,&quot; or &quot;non-HCEs&quot; are getting a share of benefits proportional to those given &quot;highly compensated employees,&quot; or &quot;HCEs,&quot; under requirements of the act.    Here's how MMH describes the formula: &quot;At least 50% of the employees participating in a plan must be non-highly compensated, unless the percentage of non-HCEs is equal to or greater than the percentage of HCEs participating in the plan. Secondly, 90% of non-HCEs must be eligible to participate in a plan with an employer-provided benefit equal to at least 50% of the most valuable benefit provided to the HCEs.&quot;    Got that? There's a lot more, but it won't be any more decipherable. That may help explain why the IRS still hasn't come up with guidelines, and probably won't until sometime after the new law is due to take effect New Year's Day. Someone, for example, will have to decide who is an HCE and who is a non-HCE and how to determine the &quot;value&quot; of a benefit.    Moreover, whereas most companies extend benefits only to full-time employees, Section 89 says that part-timers who work 17 1/2 hours a week or more will have to be counted for qualification purposes. So what does a company do then? Fire all the part-timers? Extend benefits to them at much extra cost or by diluting benefits to full-timers?    And how does a company know it is in compliance on any given day? Work force composition changes constantly, as do compensation schedules and benefit values. Will an employer, Smith College for example, need a computer dedicated to the task of updating qualification data?    To what purpose is all this? Some 132 million people in the United States receive employer-provided benefits, either as employees or dependents. That's hardly elitism. Treasury's revenues will come from newly disqualified benefits, but they will be piddling. The only explanation is a morbid fear by Congress that employers will compensate their more valuable people more generously than their less valuable people. Section 89 won't prevent that; no law ever has. But there will be new victims of unfairness, particularly among the &quot;non-HCEs.&quot;    After all these years and hard-earned lessons, some folks in Washington insist on turning the tax code into social legislation. The fact that it was done largely surreptitiously in this case makes it even less defensible. </TEXT></DOC>
