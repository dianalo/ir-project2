McFarlane and Poindexter, and``concurrence'' from the late CIA Director William C. Casey.   He said he assumed that Reagan _ who spoke out often in supportof the Contra cause _ also knew of his efforts and approved them.Reagan told the investigative Tower commission two years ago thathe did not know of his NSC staff's efforts to help the Contras.   North said he had been ``led to believe that everything I wasdoing was done at the direction of the president.''   The jury in North's trial was instructed by Gesell that``neither the president nor any of the defendant's superiors hadthe legal authority to order anyone to violate the law.''   North was his own chief witness, spending six days on the stand_ much of it under withering cross examination. He testified thatin November 1986, with the Iran-Contra affair about to be revealed,he shredded and altered documents on a list McFarlane had prepared.   On the stand, under the gentle prodding of his lawyer and theferocious cross-examination of his prosecutor, North readilyadmitted that he altered and shredded documents, and that he liedto Congress. He said he did it to keep secret what he had been toldwas secret.   ``I was raised to know the difference between right and wrong,''he testified. ``I knew it wasn't right not to tell the truth onthose things, but I didn't think it was unlawful.''   The jury of nine women and three men, whose minimumqualification was that they had not heard or watched North'stelevised appearance at the 1987 congressional hearings, had notgiven any indication during their long deliberations on what washolding up a verdict.   Wearing dark business suits and answering ``yes, sir'' and ``no,sir,'' the Oliver North in court was far different from thetruculent, combative Marine with six rows of ribbons on his chest,who aimed his passionate oratory and unflagging patriotism anationwide audience of millions in the summer of 1987.   The story that unfolded in court was a familiar one: Northrallied private support, provided strategy and supplied munitionsto the guerrillas fighting the leftist Nicaraguan government whenCongress, beginning in 1984, banned U.S. military. When Congressasked in 1985 and 1986 what he and the National Council had beendoing, North admittedly lied _ but said he did it to save lives ofAmerican supporters.   To a lesser extent, the testimony touched on the secret armssales to Iran _ a failed effort to free American hostages held inLebanon _ and the funneling of profits from those sales to theContras. North was fired by Reagan when the diversion became publicknowledge and fingered by Attorney General Edwin Meese III as``theonly person'' in the U.S. government who knew what was going on.The same day, however, the president telephoned North to say``You're a national hero.''   It appeared, before and during the trial, that the criminal caseagainst North would founder because the government was unwilling toallow some of its most deeply-held secrets to be aired in opencourt, thus depriving North of a fair trial.   But Gesell trod the fine line between keeping secrets and fairtrial. He reluctantly allowed four security experts to monitortestimony and evidence and largely succeeded in avoiding astop-and-go ``cuckoo-clock trial,'' he said he didn't want.   Still to be tried are three others charged along with North:former National Security Adviser John M. Poindexter, businessmanAlbert Hakim and Richard Secord, a retired Air Force major general.   They had pivotal roles in what North called ``the secret withinthe secret'' _ using profits from the Iranian arms sales for theContras.   ``There is no claim that the diversion of money to the Contrasfrom the sale of arms to elements in Iran is illegal,'' Gesell toldthe jury when it received the case on April 20. He told them, too,that ``it is wholly irrelevant and immaterial in this case whetheror not the president's commitment to aid the Contras was or was notsound national policy.''   Reagan made no secret of that commitment and there was testimonythat he said the Contras had to be kept intact ``body and soul''until Congress restored military aid it cut off via the so-calledBoland Amendment from 1984 to 1986.   After the verdict, a Contra spokesman said that ``from theNicaraguan point of view, we are grateful to Oliver North for allthat he has done in the past for the cause of democratizingNicaragua.''   ``But from the legal point of view, this is a matter of the lawsof the United States, and the sovereign jurors have rendered theirverdict,'' said spokesman Aristides Sanchez.   North was referred to as the ``action officer'' for centralAmerican affairs within the National Security Council. VincentCannistraro, a high-level CIA official testified that Casey oncedecreed that _ with Reagan's approval _ North was ``both thespokesman and the principal point of reference for sustaining theContras.''   Testimony at North's three-month trial, including his own,reinforced his image as the ``can-do'' Marine on the NationalSecurity Council staff who supplied the Nicaraguan Contras withmunitions and tactics while U.S. aid was banned, sold arms to Iranat a profit and used the money for the Contras.   He was not charged for those acts, but with lying about themwhen asked by Congress and Meese to explain his actions and theNSC's involvement.   When North was indicted by a grand jury in March 1988, thecharges included two broad counts of conspiracy to defraud theUnited States and theft of government property.   But independent counsel Lawrence Walsh, citing insurmountableproblems created by the mountain of classified information thatwould have to be produced, asked that those charges be dropped, andthey were.   The North trial, delayed by arguments over what nationalsecurity secrets could be told, began on Jan. 31. Prosecutorscalled 32 witnesses; the defense had 16, including North himself.   McFarlane pleaded guilty to four misdemeanor counts ofwithholding information from Congress and was sentenced to 200hours of community service in another courtroom before he testifiedat North's trial. Poindexter is scheduled to stand trial later thisyear on charges similar to some of those against North.</TEXT></DOC>
