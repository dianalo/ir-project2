 Itmanages large amounts of data and allows interactive users to accessinformation directly.andP;  SQL/DS Version 3 Release 1 has been enhanced toprovide improved loading and unloading of data, and IBM says that thatreorganising an index in SQL/DS Version 3 Release 1 will executesignificantly faster.andP;  The SQL/DS optimiser has been enhanced and theperformance of queries where joins on small tables join to one large tablewill be significantly faster.andP;  The general database performance is claimed tobe more efficient by inserting rows in a large table that has limited freespace in the DBSPACE, benefiting both application programs and databaseutilities that insert rows.andP;  SQL/DS Version 3 Release 1 uses the Multi-Blockcapability of VM/SP Release 6, resulting in a reduction of the number ofinput-outputs for data loading, and for query and transaction processing thatincludes updates.andP;  With the new field procedures function, user-writtenprocedures can alter the sorting sequence of their data.andP;  Thirteenrestrictions on accessing Views have been lifted, and constraints can bedefined for a combination of columns to ensure that no duplicate values existin those columns.andP;  The optional Procedures Language Interface optionalfeature runs in the same VM environments as SQL/DS Version 3 Release 1 andreplaces the function of the VM/System Product Interpreter SQL/Data SystemInterface, RXSQL.andP;  The product has been enhanced with improved documentation,RXSQL-specific help information for RXSQL messages, national languageenablement, and cursor and statement names that conform to the SQL identifiernaming rules.andM;Copying between minidisksandM;The interface between SQL/DS and Restructured Extended Executor Languageenables users to make ad hoc queries without entering ISQL.andP;  Otherimprovements include the management of DBEXTENTs, the units of physicalstorage on disks; a new command, Show Pool, displays the allocations of astorage pool; DBEXTENTs can be deleted, split, or merged, and on VM, they canbe copied from one virtual minidisk to another; log disks and the directorydisk can now be copied; the directory can be expanded by copying it to alarger minidisk, and to provide a similar capability for VSE users, a batchutility program is provided; most Storage Full situations can now berecovered dynamically, avoiding an abend of the database.andP;  SQL/DS Version 3Release 1 for groups 10 to 60 costs between $17,470 and $230,850.andP;  Thedistributed systems licence option starts at $13,100 and goes up to $173,150.andO;The monthly licences are between $364 and $4,810.andP;  Distributed options rangebetween $364 and $3,605 for group 60.andP;  The Entry End User/370 Entry SupportLicence costs $11,355, and an Entry End User/370 Licence to Use is $3,405.andO;The SQL/DS Proce-dures Language Interface cost between $4,990 and $65,520 forgroups 10 to 60, and the distributed licence option ranges from $3,740 to$49,140.andP;  Monthly licences start at $104 and rise to $1,365.andP;  The distributedsystems licence is between $78 and $1,020.andP;  An Entry End User/370 SupportLicence is $3,245, and Entry End User/370 Licence to Use is $970.andP;  It shipsthis month.andM;Bookmanager Build and Read Facilities for users of VM/370andM;The new releases of BookManager, Build/VM and Read/VM, enable users to readelectronic versions of a book at a personal computer or PS/2, and IBM says itintends to deliver Build and Read under MVS/TSO as well.andP;  New featuresinclude hypertext, the a bookshelf facility, and files used to create printeddocuments can create soft copy documents.andP;  Books developed on a VM/CMS hostsystem can be read, searched, and annotated on VM/CMS networks and on MS-DOSand OS/2 workstations.andP;  BookManager Read/2 1.2 conforms to SAA guidelines,and IBM intends to make the entire BookManager family SAA-compatible.andO;Build/VM groups 10 to 60 have basic monthly licences ranging between $151 and$1,350.andP;  Distributed System Licence Options start at $129 and rise to $1,145.andO;Basic annual licences are between $470 and $7,560, but the prerequisiteprimary charges start at $2,660 and go up to $42,890.andP;  Annual DistributedSystem Licence Options are between $399 and $6,430, and the primary chargesstart at $2,261 and rise to $36,450.andP;  Read/VM groups 10 to 60 have basicmonthly licence charges between $76 and $680, and between $65 and $578 forDistributed Options.andP;  Basic licences are between $236 and $3,790, withprimary licences ranging between $1,335 and $21,530.andP;  Annual DistributedOptions are $200 to $3,220, with primary licences ranging between $1,134 and$18,300.andP;  It will be available in the US on September 28, 1990.andM;Iona's Connectpac for 9370 usersandM;ConnectPac Version 2.40 is an integrated system that joins the mainframe withmicrocomputers, and is said to provide enhanced support for local areanetworks and Personal Communications/3270.andP;  It also provides a microcomputerextension to host mail and scheduling applications called InfoMinder Version2.40 is available on 9370, 4300 and 30XX processors, in addition to personalcomputers and PS/2s.andP;  It operates under MUSIC/SP Version 2 and MS-DOS Version3.1.andP;  No prices, but it became available in the US June 29, 1990.andP;  ConnectPacVersion 2.40 is published and licensed by Iona College, and marketed by IBMthrough the Co-operative Software Programme.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
