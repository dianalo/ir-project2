Live national television wanted Bono. Bay Area local television wantedBono and used injured Steve Young to interview his own replacement. Reporterswere chasing Bono around the empty field after the game, trying to find outjust exactly who this Bono guy is.;   That's because the guy who was supposedto just keep the team's head above water until Young could come back helpedthe 49ers break out of their three-week-long offensive slump.;   In the firsthalf, Bono completed 14 of 26 passes for 274 yards, putting him on a pace toshatter the 49ers' single-game passing record of 476 yards set by Montana lastyear in Atlanta.;   &quot;He shocked me tonight with all the completions he had,&quot;tackle Steve Wallace said. &quot;I think he's getting more confidence with everyweek. . . . You can see it in his eyes. It's the same concentration that's inJoe's and (Young's) eyes.&quot;;   Bono proved Monday night what some people havebeen saying for the last couple of weeks: That even though Bono has beenshrouded in anonymity on the bench behind one superstar -- Montana -- and onestar -- Young -- he is a capable NFL-caliber quarterback.;   &quot;He's realcomposed,&quot; Jerry Rice said. &quot;He taking complete control out there.&quot;;   All ofthis low-key, just-doing-my-job-ma'am confidence that Bono is exuding is notonly surprising the general public but some of his teammates. Most of the49ers' previous experience with Bono, before the past few weeks, was watchinghim imitate big-name quarterbacks -- Boomer Esiason, Jim Everett, Phil Simms,etc. -- in practice. That was his job for two years. Who could have expectedhim to become a big name himself?;   &quot;He's getting practice time and gameexperience,&quot; receiver Mike Sherrard said. &quot;I've always known he could do it,but now he's getting to play.&quot;;   The 49ers gave Bono his chances to show whathe could do Monday night. After keeping it conservative in recent weeks, the49ers' offensive game plan had been criticized by media and players, and byRice in particular. But Monday, the offense was opened up and Bono proved hecould go deep.;   &quot;They play a lot of eight-man front,&quot; offensive coordinatorMike Holmgren said. &quot;Any team that does that is difficult to run against.&quot;;  So the 49ers threw. After an incompletion, Bono completed his next six passes,including a 41-yard pass over the middle to Brent Jones that set up the 49ers'first touchdown and a 78-yard pass play to John Taylor that set up the 49ers'second touchdown, and the rout was on.;   &quot;We took some chances and got thebig plays,&quot; Bono said. &quot;That was our game plan.&quot;;   Rice, who had fourreceptions for 59 yards, was happy with the game plan.;   &quot;Whenever we comeout and stretch the defense, it opens up the passes underneath,&quot; Rice said.;  Bono stood in the pocket and took his punishment. Though he was never sacked,he was slammed to the ground several times when he released the ball.;   &quot;Ifeel like I'm going to have a pretty good headache later,&quot; Bono said.;   Afterthe game, Bono -- who finished 18-of-33 passing for 306 yards -- took in hisnew popularity with a bemused look. When asked &quot;this is your best game since .. . ?&quot; he laughed.;   &quot;College,' he answered. &quot;The Fiesta Bowl. Over Miami.&quot;;  That was seven years ago, Bono's senior year at UCLA. Since then he hasn'thad many accomplishments to dwell on.;   Monday's game will stay with Bono along time. And with his teammates.;   &quot;We've all got confidence in SteveBono,&quot; running back Tom Rathman said. &quot;He's a Bono-fide player.&quot;;   Some jokesjust won't die.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  ANN KILLION, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Anaheim  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911126  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  November  </MONTH><PG.COL>  5C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  745  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday, November 26, 199100331075,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
