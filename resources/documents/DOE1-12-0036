The reaction ofCS{sub 2} with OH{sup -} ion was found to be rate controlling and proceededby the formation of a dithiocarbonate complex. The major reaction productwas sulfate with sulfur occurring as colloidal suspensions only at pHvalues less than 8. The formation of sulfate increased exponentiallywith time and was also found to be dependent on the rate of hydrolysisof CS{sub 2}. In addition, the production of sulfate showed large inductionperiods, suggesting either a complex mechanism or formation by secondaryreactions. The results obtained for carbon disulfide were extended tocarbonyl sulfide (OCS) oxidation in alkaline solutions. The removal ofOCS (acid gas) from mixtures of gases by alkaline liquid absorbents (e.g.NaOH) and oxidation of subsequent solutions to sulfate is an importantindustrial practice. 42 references, 14 figures, 2 tables.</TEXT></DOC>
