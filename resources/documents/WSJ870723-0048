But U.S. District Court Judge William Schwarzer declined to issue a preliminary injunction blocking South San Francisco-based Genentech from making or using the product until the biotechnology concern's challenge to the validity of the infringed patent can go to trial.    The suit centers on a costly blood-clotting protein known as Factor VIII, which hemophiliacs must receive periodically. Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation of La Jolla, Calif., holds a patent for purifying and concentrating Factor VIII derived from human blood. Scripps has licensed the patent to Fort Washington, Pa.-based Rorer Group Inc.    Genentech is one of three biotechnology concerns that have devised a method of producing the complex protein through recombinant technology, or cloning. Such a development would eliminate concerns that hemophiliacs risk viral infections by using Factor VIII extracted from donated blood.    Neither the Scripps method of purification nor any of the three cloning methods have received Food and Drug Administration approval for sale of the product.    Scripps and Rorer have sued Genentech, charging that the cloning technology violates the Scripps patent. Similar suits have been filed against Emeryville, Calif.-based Chiron Corp. and Baxter Travenol Laboratories of Deerfield, Ill., said Genentech.    Judge Schwarzer's summary judgment said Genentech did infringe on the patent. But he said it could continue its experimental work with the product, both because it plans to seek the overturn of the patent's validity and because Genentech had made a &quot;strong argument&quot; that &quot;hemophiliacs could suffer if there is any delay in bringing recombinant (Factor VIII) to the market.&quot;    The judge also said that Genentech had offered evidence sufficient &quot;at least to raise genuine issues as to validity&quot; of the Scripps patent, although he didn't address their likelihood of success in the trial.    Rorer called the ruling a victory. &quot;What this court has said is that if you are an innovator in a field, the court will protect your right to commercialize your invention,&quot; said a spokeswoman. &quot;That's what licensing is about.&quot; She added that Rorer &quot;doesn't wish to stifle anybody from improving Factor VIII.&quot;    The court ordered the parties to meet and discuss the possibility of settlement.    A Genentech official said yesterday that &quot;in view of our opinion of the validity of the patent, a settlement is unlikely,&quot; He said the ruling means &quot;no change in Genentech's course.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
