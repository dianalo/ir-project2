A combinationof log measurements and core data were employed to locate and orientfractures and assess their overall contribution to reservoir performancein a Devonian reef complex. These techniques include the imaging of thewell bore with the Formation MicroScanner Log (FMS) (Mark of Schlumberger)and the Borehole Televiewer (BMTV). The image data were compared to detailedcore analysis, where available, and were used to determine the length,orientation, and probability of fractures as a function of porosity.The Array-Sonic (Mark of Schlumberger) tool was also run to help identifyfractured zones using full waveform data and to quantify producibilityfrom Stoneley wave data in comparison to flowmeter production logs. Fromthe comparison of the images with core, the utility of the FMS and BHTVlogs were established in identifying fractures and fracture sets as wellas determining the orientation and vertical extent of the fractures.In addition, the response of FMS images to different porosity types wasconfirmed by core data. Comparison of the Array-Sonic data and the flowmeterproduction log data established the usefulness of the Stonely wave attenuationas a means of identifying permeable zones. The study results permit betterdefinition of tool response to porosity types and fractures, and revealsthe influence of fractures on the overall production of the reef complex.These results have implications on the initial and secondary productiontechniques of this and other carbonate reservoirs.</TEXT></DOC>
