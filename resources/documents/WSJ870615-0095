But this time he's doing it by getting out of OTC stocks.    He's also learning how to order furniture and fill out government forms.    Mr. Stuka left Fidelity Investments last June to strike out on his own. After five months setting up Stuka Associates' modest office a couple blocks near Fidelity, Mr. Stuka launched his own investment partnership, or &quot;hedge&quot; fund in late November with about $12.5 million. At Fidelity, Mr. Stuka had steered the OTC Fund to a 69% gain in 1985, the second best showing that year among U.S. mutual funds. The ensuing publicity made fund-raising considerably easier for him than it is for many entrepreneurial money managers.    Mr. Stuka's partnership now contains $29.4 million, and its investments are up 37% so far this year as of last Thursday, compared with a 23.4% rise for the Sandamp;P 500-stock index. A $7.1 million account operated separately for a foreign investor is up 44%.    It hasn't all been smooth sailing, though.    Start-up problems included a decision to leave uninvested several million dollars in new funds for about two weeks in January while documentation was put in order. While the cash sat, the market &quot;went straight up,&quot; Mr. Stuka says, and his partnership fell about six percentage points behind the Sandamp;P 500.    Mr. Stuka made up ground in the following months, however. He pulled ahead of the Sandamp;P 500 with a few successful technology picks, including Boston-area companies such as GenRad Inc., Teradyne Inc. and Digital Equipment Corp. He also did well with some short positions, notably in Endotronics Inc., a biotechnology company. Mr. Stuka, who worked as an accountant at Arthur Young andamp; Co. after graduating from Holy Cross College, says he noticed the company was building up large accounts receivable. Endotronics' shares subsequently nosedived to less than $1 from around $24.    For the most part, Mr. Stuka says, he's been staying ahead of the market with &quot;a blue-collar strategy . . . grinding it out, trying to beat the market by a tenth of a percent every day.&quot;    Mr. Stuka also has been extracting his clients' money from the OTC stocks that were so successful for him in 1985. For that matter, he had been extracting much of their money from the stock market altogether until the past week or so.    Two weeks ago, Mr. Stuka says, his partnership was less than 50% invested in stocks, causing him to miss much of the market's recent run-up. The fund currently is almost fully invested again, but only around 30% in OTC stocks, down from about 75% when he started the partnership. Mr. Stuka has reduced the number of stocks in his portfolio to about 80 from 100 or so, and says he hopes to get down to around 60 within the next month by eliminating more of the smaller ones.    Mr. Stuka dismisses the argument that OTC shares are trading at relatively low levels compared with the rest of the market and are thus due for a turnaround. &quot;People have been arguing that for the last 1 1/2 years and it hasn't happened yet,&quot; he says. &quot;I don't think it will.&quot;    The bull market is &quot;living on borrowed time&quot; Mr. Stuka believes. &quot;I'm very, very nervous about getting stuck in small stocks,&quot; he says. &quot;At the end of the rainbow, there's no way to get out of some of this stuff.&quot; To stay in the market means &quot;you may be playing for the last 5% to 10%&quot; of stocks' upward runs, he says. &quot;There's a lot of risk; how much do you want to take?&quot;    Mr. Stuka does see opportunities in the financial sector, including insurance companies and some major banks whose prices hadn't performed well until the past few weeks.    A hedge fund, unlike standard mutual funds, is allowed to sell stocks short -- in essence, a gamble that their prices will decline -- and Mr. Stuka gradually has been doing more of that. But the market hasn't peaked as quickly as he'd anticipated. On a recent day, he kept glancing uncomfortably at the Quotron screen beside his desk as stocks he shorted continued to rise.    Days like the previous one, when the Sandamp;P 500 gained 1.75% but the partnership climbed only 0.5%, &quot;just drive you absolutely nuts,&quot; Mr. Stuka says, tearing a strip of Scotch tape and sticking the pieces from one finger to another.    Having taken in new money in January and April, Mr. Stuka says he doesn't expect to open the partnership again this year, although he believes it would be &quot;no problem&quot; to raise more money. He says he would eventually like the partnership to grow to $50 million or perhaps $100 million, but not much more, because beyond some point &quot;the more money you bring in, the worse your performance, all other things being equal.&quot;    Then there's what the 32-year-old Mr. Stuka refers to as &quot;the burnout factor,&quot; or the risk of getting so overworked he loses interest in the market. With a 15% share of the partnership's profits, he says, &quot;I can make a damn good living with $36 million.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
