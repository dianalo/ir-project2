The decision, spurred by growing congressional criticism of theweapons program, marks the most fundamental change in the EnergyDepartment's weapons contracting system since companies wererecruited to build the first atomic bombs in the 1940s.   The companies traditionally have been allowed to recovervirtually all their costs, even those resulting from their ownnegligence. The logic was that weapons production was sospecialized and vital to national security that the governmentcould not afford to risk losing a plant operator over money matters.   The new thinking, under Energy Secretary James D. Watkins, isthat the weapons contractors will perform better if they are heldaccountable for their mistakes.   Under the new system, the government will continue payingcontractors' normal operating expenses, but for the first time allcosts resulting from negligence will be borne by the companiesinstead of the taxpayers, Stephen A. Wakefield, the EnergyDepartment's general counsel, said in an interview.   Wakefield said a formal proposal to amend the department'sregulations to end the practice of reimbursing all contractor costswill be announced in January, and it could become official policyby late spring. Detailed application would be made in the annualnegotiations with each contractor that normally set the terms underwhich bonuses are awarded in the coming year.   Private companies run all 17 major facilities in the nuclearweapons complex. The Energy Department spends about $11 billion ayear on the arms program.   The issue of liability is important because the plants havebillions of dollars in environmental problems, and some continue toviolate environmental laws. The Rocky Flats plutonium processingplant in Colorado is under FBI investigation for possible criminalviolations of federal hazardous waste laws.   In exchange for assuming a bigger share of the financial risk ofoperating the weapons plants, the contractors will be offeredbigger bonus payments for excellent work, Wakefield said.   Wakefield declined to say how much extra bonus money would bemade available, but he said ``it would not be unreasonable'' tothink current fees might be doubled.   The companies typically can earn several million dollars a yearfor operating the plants. For example, Westinghouse Electric Corp.,which holds contracts to run several of the plants, earned $3.9million in bonus fees from April through September for operatingthe Savannah River nuclear facility near Aiken, S.C.   Wakefield said ``there are varying levels of concern'' among thecompanies which have been briefed on the outlines of the contractchanges.   ``A couple of them have said, `Well, this is one more thing wehave to consider in ... deciding do we want to be in thisbusiness,''' Wakefield said, adding that none so far has indicatedit would withdraw as a result of the changes.   Wakefield cited several examples of circumstances under whichthe department no longer would reimburse the contractors:   _Environmental fines and related legal costs stemming fromactions by the contractor that could reasonably have been avoided.Last month the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm ofCongress, reported that the department had reimbursed two plantcontracts for $295,000 in fines levied for violations of hazardouswaste laws _ plus $529,000 in the companies' legal costs.   _Damage to government property as a result of negligence.Wakefield said that if the new contract provision had been in placein January, E.I. du Pont de Nemours andamp; Co., which then was operatorat Savannah River, would have been liable for damage to severalnuclear reactor valves caused by improper testing procedures. Thedepartment has estimated the valve damage at $20,000.   _Damage to third parties, including people and property outsidethe plant, due to negligence by the contractor. Wakefield said thiscould, under some circumstances, mean the contractor instead of thegovernment would have to pay for environmental or health damageresulting from the spread of radioactive contamination.</TEXT></DOC>
