Applicant is a trust created pursuant to trust agreement dated May 27,1935, as most recently amended on July 18, 1978. It is a diversified, open-end,management investment company, and meet the requirements of an ``employees'securities company'' within the meaning of section 2(a)(13) of the 1940Act. Applicant's objective is to seek long-term growth of capital and futureincome. General Electric Investment Corporation (``GEIC''), a wholly-ownedsubsidiary of General Electric Company (``GE'') and an investment adviserregistered with the SEC, serves as Applicant's investment adviser.2. Purchase of Applicant's units may be made by regular and senior membersof the Elfun Society (an honorary society of GE employees) and certainof their family members. Regular members of the Elfun Society are selectedfrom active employees of GE and its majority-owned subsidiaries; seniormembers are former regular members who have retired from those companies.Pursuant to an application filed on May 31, 1989 (File No. 813-90), Applicanthas also applied for an order to permit purchases of units not only byElfun Society members, but also by any persons designated from time totime by its trustees, provided their participation does not alter its statusas an ``employees' securities company'' within the meaning of section 2(a)(13)of the Act. 3. Beginning in 1977, four additional funds, Elfun Tax-Exempt Income Fund,Elfun Income Fund, Elfun Diversified Fund and Elfun Global Fund (the ``OtherFunds''), were established for the benefit of GE employees and their families.In July 1986, Applicant decided, for the sake of administrative convenience,to have the same set of trustees serve both the Applicant and the OtherFunds. At Applicant's request, each of its independent trustees voluntarilysubmitted his resignation, and the trustees of the Other Funds were electedas trustees of Applicant. Since that time, all of Applicant's trusteeshave been interested trustees. 4. During a routine file search in March 1989, GEIC discovered that Applicanthad substituted interested trustees without having obtained exemptionsunder sections 10(a) and 15(c). The Other Funds had previously obtainedexemptive relief from sections 10(a) and 15(c). <T3>See</T3> Investment Company Act Release Nos. 9879 (July 5, 1977), 13612(Nov. 2, 1983), 16114 (Nov. 5, 1987), and 16816 (Dec. 22, 1987). Consequently,Applicant filed the application to bring its future operations into compliancewith the 1940 Act. Applicant is not seeking relief under section l6(a)with respect to the substitution of interested trustees, nor has it requested,or does it now request, approval of such substitution by the SEC. 5. Applicant acknowledges that the relief requested will be prospectiveonly. Applicant will not rely on any order granted pursuant to the applicationfor relief during the period from July 1986 until April 25, 1989. 6. Applicant's five interested trustees are all GE officers or employeeswho have been assigned to the operations of GEIC. The trustees do not receiveany compensation from Applicant for serving as trustees, although Applicantwill be required to reimburse GEIC for the portion of the remunerationthey may receive which is allocable to the time they spend on Applicant'smatters in their capacity as GEIC employees. While GEIC and GE providevarious services to Applicant and are reimbursed for the reasonable costsof providing such services, no element of profit is included in such charges.7. Because more than 60% of Applicant's trustees are interested personsas defined in section 2 (a)(19) of the 1940 Act, Applicant seeks relieffrom section 10(a). Applicant argues that the protection of investors doesnot require the appointment of disinterested trustees for several reasons.First, the trustees, GEIC, and GE all have a very strong interest in assuringthat Applicant is well managed. While GE is not Applicant's sponsor, Applicantoffers an additional investing opportunity which is open solely to certainGE employees, former employees, and their immediate relatives. Thus, Applicant'ssuccess has a strong bearing on employee morale and satisfactory employeerelations, a matter in which GE is vitally interested. Second, it is notnecessary to engage outside persons as disinterested trustees to bringApplicant skills needed for its operation, given the extensive experienceand knowledge of the persons who have been selected to act as Applicant'strustees. Third, Applicant has estimated that the addition of four disinterestedtrustees could add approximately $50,000 to annual operating expenses.8. Because all of the trustees are interested persons of GEIC, an exemptionis also requested from the requirements of section 15(c), which would requirethe approval by a majority of disinterested trustees of any renewal ofan investment advisory contract. Since the replacement of trustees, therehas been no amendment to Applicant's investment advisory contract, or anyother material change in its operations.9. Applicant asserts that the requested relief is appropriate because theinvestment advisory services to be furnished to Applicant will be furnishedat cost. Moreover, it is highly unlikely that such a contract could beentered with any entity other than one, such as GEIC, which is uniquelyrelated to the needs and welfare of the purchasers of Applicant's fundunits. Finally, Applicant believes that GE's interest in Applicant's successis so fundamental that any risk of the retention of unsatisfactory investmentadvisers would seem remote. For these reasons, Applicant believes thatit does not appear to be in the best interest of investors to subject itsinvestment advisory contract to the burdensome and expensive approval andrenewal requirements of section 15(c).<ITAG tagnum="21">For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, underdelegated authority. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jonathan G.
