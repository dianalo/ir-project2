But Members of Congress from both parties, aware that Census results affect billions of dollars in federal aid and the distribution of House seats, have been trying to second-guess the Census Bureau and influence the outcome. Forcing such tinkering on the bureau will compromise the nation's head count.    Rep. Thomas Petri, a Wisconsin Republican, wants to stop counting illegal aliens for the purposes of reapportioning House seats. Otherwise, House seats would be transferred to states with large illegal populations. Last week, a House committee attached his proposal to a bill by Democratic Rep. Mervyn Dymally that would force the Census Bureau to compensate for any undercount of minorities. Rep. Dymally, who opposes the Petri measure, then cast the deciding vote to kill his own bill.    But efforts to tug the Census Bureau this way or that aren't over. Rep. Petri intends to reintroduce his proposal next year, and New York City is preparing to sue the Census Bureau to force its count to include the estimated three million people it will miss nationwide. Adoption of either proposal would make an accurate head count more difficult and inject politics into one of the few government agencies that does its job without constant micromanagement by Congress.    Rep. Petri says the Census Bureau counted two million illegal aliens in 1980, and the total next time could top five million. States with few illegal aliens, such as Pennsylvania, will lose House seats to such states as California if illegal aliens are counted. Rep. Petri says some citizens would thus be denied an equal voice in Congress, adding that it is &quot;repugnant&quot; to allocate House seats on the basis of people &quot;who would be deported if the laws were being enforced.&quot;    Actually, we think the immigration laws Rep. Petri speaks of are more repugnant than anything the Census Bureau could cook up. In any event, the Constitution clearly states that all &quot;free persons&quot; are to be counted for reapportionment purposes, and most courts have held that the Framers were well aware of the semantic distinction between &quot;person&quot; and &quot;citizen.&quot;    Rep. Dymally agrees efforts to exclude aliens are impractical, but he says the Census Bureau must account for the estimated 1.4% of the population -- including many urban blacks -- that they missed in 1980. Rep. Dymally claims not adjusting for this undercount will deny minorities adequate representation and their share of federal dollars. He doesn't mention it could also send his liberal colleagues from declining population areas into retirement.    Mr. Dymally says adjusting for an undercount is feasible, but the Commerce Department decided last year not to change procedures, saying that whichever one of 24 competing methodologies it adopted would be statistically suspect. No doubt the Census will again miss some people, but attempting to quantify that total will only introduce more mistakes into the process. The party in power would always be tempted to answer such complaints by using a new method that aided it politically.    The Census Bureau plans to work with the NAACP and other groups to achieve the most immediate, practical solution -- encouraging minorities and others to participate in the Census. That is more likely to ensure an accurate count than turning the U.S. census into a constant game of political number-shopping. </TEXT></DOC>
