<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-81-0577 </DOCNO><TEXT>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an exciting new technique which promisesto change further the rapidly expanding armamentarium of the radiologist.Magnetic resonance (MR) produces tomographic images using magnetism andradiowaves that in many patients are more sensitive and contain moreinformation than either high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) orother x-ray studies. Certain strengths of HRCT, particularly in the temporalbone, have limited the impact of MRI in this area. Newer MR scanner usingspecialized radiofrequency (RF) receiver coils are now capable of producingimages with slice thickness and in plane spatial resolution approachingthe best of CT scanners.</TEXT></DOC>
