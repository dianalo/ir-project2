The rebound came despite a rise in oil prices and a $405 million bond sale by Chrysler Corp.'s pension fund. Traders said the Chrysler move had been widely anticipated, and thus its impact was muted.    Trading volume was light once again amid apprehension among investment managers about government economic reports to be released today and tomorrow. The reports are expected to show further signs of economic strength, which many analysts say could reduce the chances for further declines in interest rates.    The Commerce Department this morning will release retail sales figures for February. Many analysts expect a vigorous increase of about 2.5% to 3%, following January's sharp drop of 5.8%. The Federal Reserve Board tomorrow is expected to report that industrial production rose about 0.7% last month after a 0.4% rise in January. Also tomorrow, the Labor Department will release its producer price index. Analysts predict the index rose about 0.4%, following a 0.6% increase in January.    But even if the economy may be accelerating, some forecasters argue that interest rates aren't likely to change much in coming months. They contend that inflation will remain moderate and that the Federal Reserve will conclude it doesn't need to tighten or loosen credit policy. Moreover, money supply figures to be released this afternoon are expected to show little or no growth last month.    &quot;We think interest rates won't go down much further, if any further,&quot; said Frederick W. Zuckerman, Chrysler's vice president and treasurer. &quot;We believe the equity market will outperform the bond market over the next three to six months.&quot;    The Chrysler bond sale yesterday, which consisted mostly of corporate issues, was the first stage of a restructuring of the bond portion of the $3.5 billion pension fund. Mr. Zuckerman said the money will be used to buy stocks &quot;soon.&quot; He also said the Chrysler pension fund plans to sell &quot;another $500 million or $600 million&quot; of bonds, mostly corporates and mortgage-backed securities, within the next two months or so, with proceeds to be reinvested in stocks.    &quot;I want to be a little vague on the timing (of this second phase) because the market tends to get on the edge of its chair about things of this size,&quot; Mr. Zuckerman said.    Before yesterday's sale, Chrysler's pension fund had about 70% of its money in bonds, an unusually heavy percentage. Mr. Zuckerman said he plans to reduce that to about 35%.    About 60% of the bonds sold yesterday were utility issues, Mr. Zuckerman said. Another 20% were foreign government and foreign corporate bonds, while the remaining 20% were U.S. financial institutions and financial service companies. He said there was a total of 139 issues by 52 issuers.    Four securities dealers bid for the bonds. The two dealers that bought most of the issues were Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. and Salomon Brothers Inc., Mr. Zuckerman said. He added that Chrysler received about $6.4 million, or 1.6%, above the prices at which the bonds closed Tuesday.    &quot;I really liked the results&quot; of the huge auction, Mr. Zuckerman said. &quot;We got good prices even though the market was soft&quot; early in the day. &quot;I am convinced we did better selling them through an auction process than if we had gone through any single firm,&quot; he added.    An index of long-term Treasury bonds compiled by Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. rose 0.38 point yesterday to close at 1423.52. The index, which has stayed in an unusually narrow range in recent weeks, hovered between 1419.41 and 1424.56.    The Treasury's 7 1/2% bonds due 2016 rose slightly to a price of 99 22/32 from 99 21/32 Tuesday, as the yield edged lower to 7.52% from 7.53%. The government's 7 1/4% notes due 1996 rose to 100 7/32 from 100 5/32, leaving the yield unchanged at about 7.22%.    Interest rates on short-term Treasury bills inched higher. The latest three-month Treasury bill rate rose slightly to 5.68% bid from 5.66% Tuesday, while the latest six-month bill rate increased to 5.63% bid from 5.62%. The rate on federal funds, or reserves that banks lend each other overnight, averaged about 6.32% yesterday after averaging 6.29% Tuesday.    The Federal Reserve's money-supply statistics to be released today probably will have little or no influence on the Fed's credit policy, most analysts agree. Fed officials have indicated they are paying less attention to money figures than to broad U.S. and international economic trends, including the performance of the dollar and commodity prices.    &quot;The Fed doesn't seem to be excited about the money supply figures right now, and it isn't likely to react to them (today's report) at all,&quot; said Robert A. Brusca, senior vice president and chief economist at Nikko Securities Co. International.    The Fed will release data for last month on all three money measures, known as M1, M2 and M3. According to the average estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by the Dow Jones Capital Markets Report, the M1 measure fell $800 million in the week ended March 2. The survey also showed an average estimated decline last month of $700 million in M2 and a drop of $100 million in M3. In January, these measures rose sharply.    If those forecasts prove correct, the M2 and M3 measures will wind up near the lower end of the Fed's target range of 5 1/2% to 8 1/2% growth this year. The Fed doesn't have a target for M1.    Elsewhere in the credit markets, a $200 million issue of Rockwell International Corp. notes, due in 10 years, was offered to investors yesterday. Daiwa Securities America Inc. said the 7 1/2% notes were priced at 98.75 to yield 7.682%. The notes are rated double-A-2 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and double-A by Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.    Separately, a $180 million issue of Ocean Showboat Finance Corp. 11 3/8% mortgage-backed bonds, due March 15, 2002, was priced at par. Rated single-B-1 by Moody's and single-B-plus by Sandamp;P, the issue was sold through Donaldson Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp.    In the municipal market, a $683.7 million issue of Municipal Assistance Corp. for the City of New York bonds drew a warm response from investors. The issue was priced by a Salomon Brothers group to yield from 6% in 1997 to 6.968% in 2007. It was rated single-A-1 by Moody's and single-A-plus by Sandamp;P.    Despite the afternoon rally in the Treasury bond market, prices of municipal issues declined yesterday. The setback partly reflected concern about the current and expected heavy volume of new state and local government issues.    The municipal market &quot;is still in reasonably good shape, but it's getting hit a little because of worries about the large supply,&quot; said Jeffrey Noss, manager of municipal research for Roosevelt andamp; Cross Inc. of New York. Many municipal issuers are rushing to refund their high-coupon debt at current interest rates, he said, and issuers in Puerto Rico and North Carolina are expected to offer billion-dollar refunding issues in coming weeks. </TEXT></DOC>
