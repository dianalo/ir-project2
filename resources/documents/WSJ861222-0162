GalanteStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/22/86</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><TEXT>   COSTUME JEWELRY has polished its image. Thanks to the ornamental excesses of trend setters like pop singers Cyndi Lauper and Madonna, costume jewelry has become a fashion accessory in its own right, no longer the poor stepsister of fine jewelry. But if the industry is to prosper over the long term, it will probably have Harvey I. Aronoff to thank more than any rock star.    Mr. Aronoff is an industrial engineer. He is trying to bring manufacturing discipline to an industry that hasn't always welcomed it. &quot;The jewelry industry always considered itself an artistic industry,&quot; says Steffan Aletti, editor of American Jewelry Manufacturer magazine. &quot;Consequently, manufacturers never subjected themselves to the kind of time-and-motion studies that Detroit has. They would say, 'Well, after all, I'm an artist.'&quot;    Now, low-priced imports are forcing manufacturers to shed their artistic airs. Sales of rings, bracelets and other baubles made of non-precious materials have risen an average 8.6% a year since 1981, reaching $1.63 billion last year at the wholesale level. But imports have grown faster, at about 14% annually. As a result, domestic manufacturers, most of them small, closely held companies, control only 72% of the market, down from 83% in 1981. The competition comes mainly from Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea and Japan.    AMERICAN MANUFACTURERS aren't crying too loudly yet. Because demand is so brisk, most everyone is benefiting. But they worry about what will happen when a recession comes along. Then they will have the unenviable task of fighting lower-cost producers for scarcer consumer dollars.    Enter Mr. Aronoff, the industrial engineer. Recruited by the Manufacturing Jewelers andamp; Silversmiths of America Inc., a trade group, he is trying to move costume-jewelry manufacturing into the 20th century. &quot;The industry is just very, very weak on standards-production control, quality control, work flow,&quot; says Mr. Aronoff, who specializes in engineering for mature industries.    Mr. Aronoff is concentrating his efforts around Providence, R.I. The New England city traces its role as the center of the American jewelry and silverware industry to the arrival in the 17th century of French Huguenots, who were skilled in metal-crafting. Among their more famous sons was Paul Revere, a silversmith as well as a patriot.    Today, Rhode Island is home to about 700 makers of jewelry and silverware. The bulk of production comes from costume jewelry. But efficiency rates are low, typically 60% to 70% of capacity, Mr. Aronoff says. Accordingly, he is showing manufacturers how to cut costs and add luster to their bottom lines.    THE EFFICIENCY STRATEGY contains some decidedly simple steps to motivate workers to increase productivity. For example, at American Jewelry Chain Co., Mr. Aronoff found skilled chain assemblers were using up to 30% of their time carrying work to and from inventory. On his advice, the company turned that job over to unskilled laborers.    Using stopwatches to conduct classic time-and-motion studies, Mr. Aronoff also established production-rate standards for piecework pay. Previously, the company paid a flat hourly wage. Now, a worker might be expected to attach clasps to 220 chains to earn $6 an hour. Exceeding that target would earn the worker extra pay.    The average earning now is about $6.50 an hour, a substantial increase from around $5 before the changes, says company President Joseph V. Swist. &quot;But we increased our productivity proportionally by at least that amount and reduced our staff (in the linking department) by two.&quot; In all, American Jewelry has trimmed its payroll to 55 employees from 70 before the undertaking.    At nearby Fort Inc., which has evolved from making cheap wedding bands to producing pewter souvenirs, simple divisions of labor have brought efficiencies. Previously, for example, a single worker both operated a pewter-casting machine and removed the cast items from their molds. But the latter job took 50% longer than the casting, leaving the machines idle much of the time. Now, at Mr. Aronoff's suggestion, two workers do those jobs.    ELSEWHERE AT FORT, new job descriptions, incentive pay and revisions in plant layout have helped raise productivity to 70% of capacity from a dismal 40% before the overhaul. Previously, says a sheepish company president, James C. Forte, &quot;we thought we had one of the best factories around.&quot;    Not all manufacturers are relying on productivity improvements to strengthen their positions. Parker Manufacturing Corp., for one, is adding a flashier, &quot;high-fashion&quot; look to its traditional line of conservatively styled costume jewelry. It also is working to improve quality. &quot;The imports are pushing everybody up on the quality scale,&quot; says Chairman William E. Strouss.    Nor has the productivity program been universally popular. At Fort, some longtime employees haven't adapted to the incentive-pay system. As a result, employee turnover is higher, and some employees have been moved off the manufacturing line.    The trade association also has had difficulty getting manufacturers to share their ideas for combating imports. Even the most antiquated jewelry maker, it seems, clings to the notion that it enjoys a competitive secret. Says Mr. Aronoff: &quot;They're working in the Dark Ages, but they're all hiding the size of their caldrons.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
