Temperatures stayed below the freezing point overnightthroughout much of the South, but were expected to reach the 60s inthe Carolinas by the end of the week, the National Weather Servicesaid.   Airlines resumed normal schedules Tuesday at Charleston, S.C.,after reducing flights because of snow, which piled up 15 inchesdeep in places along the coast Sunday. The Myrtle Beach Jetport,closed for a third straight day Monday, was able to operate onlyduring daylight because runway lights were covered by snow, saidTodd Crawford, deputy airport director.   At least 96 deaths from the Plains to the East Coast had beenblamed on the cold since Dec. 15.   The worst of the water problems was at Jackson, Miss., where anestimated 60,000 homes and businesses were without water or hadgreatly reduced pressure. Frozen pipes had cracked but the biggestproblem was that the Pearl River had frozen around intakes for themunicipal water system.   Jackson's city government closed Tuesday because of the waterproblem and several businesses that normally use a lot of wateragreed to close Tuesday or reduce operations. Mayor Kane Ditto saidthat with luck, water could restored to all areas by late Wednesday.   Texas cities also had broken water pipes, with more than 6,000leaks reported in Houston. Some people had been without water sinceFriday.   Plumbers were besieged with calls.   ``The wait could be a week, if not longer,'' said Billy Duncan,owner of Duncan's A-1 Redi Rooter Plumbing in San Antonio. ``Itdepends on how fast we can get to them and how fast we can getparts in.''   ``We're sitting here with about 300 calls, and there's no way wecan get to all of them,'' Duncan said.   Hotels in Houston offered discount rates for people who onlywanted to take showers.   Taps also ran dry in Charleston. ``There's got to be thousandsof broken lines out there,'' said Steve Kinard, manager ofCharleston's public works department, which supplies water to400,000 people.   And in Norfolk, Va., Fire Chief George A. Ingram said: ``We'vegot water mains and pipes bursting all over the city, everythingfrom hotels to businesses to homes.''   In New Orleans, water pressure dropped to dangerous levels andthe Sewerage andamp; Water Board issued urgent pleas for homeowners tofind broken pipes and turn off the water. Firefighters battling amajor fire Monday were hindered by the low water pressure, FireDepartment spokesman Bob Whitman said.   The cold caused substantial damage to Florida's $3.5 billioncitrus crop and hurt other important winter crops, agricultureofficials said Tuesday.   Although Florida officials hadn't released citrus loss figures,the freeze damage was likely to be substantial since much of thecrop was still on the trees when freezing temperatures beganSaturday.   Texas state officials estimated 70 percent of their citrus cropand 80 percent of the winter vegetable crop were destroyed. Losseswere estimated at $200 million. But some Texas officials andgrowers predicted they would be higher because warming temperaturesruined any hopes of salvaging the frozen fruit for juice.   In North Carolina, power had been restored Tuesday morning tonearly knocked by Sunday's blizzard, officials said.   Of the 500 Cape Hatteras Electric Membership Cooperativecustomers who had been without power Monday night, only the CoastGuard station at Hatteras Inlet remained in the dark, said SandyGray, a staff assistant for the cooperative.   North Carolina Power, which had reported 5,000 people withoutelectricity at the height of the storm, had ``zero customers out''Wednesday, said spokeswoman Cindy Odom.</TEXT></DOC>
