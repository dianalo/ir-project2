Separately, an investigation into another Scandinavian arms maker, Norway's state-owned Kongsberg Vaapenfabrikk AS, continued as a Norwegian police official said he is examining two sales of machine-tool equipment to China as part of more than 100 Kongsberg transactions under review for possible export violations.    In Sweden, Lars Ringberg, Stockholm's chief prosecutor, said he decided to open the investigation into Bofors after reviewing a report by the country's National Audit Bureau, which concluded that Bofors didn't violate any law in winning the Indian order. The report, completed June 1, was based on information provided voluntarily by Bofors and on confidential documents from Sweden's central bank.    Yesterday, however, Mr. Ringberg said he has &quot;reason to believe&quot; that Bofors did violate a law prohibiting Swedish companies from paying fees to foreign officials to win contracts. He declined to elaborate, citing Swedish secrecy laws governing pretrial investigations.    The audit bureau's findings indicated that Bofors paid a severance fee, amounting to 3% of the contract, or about $39 million, to an Indian agent who helped arrange the field-artillery contract, Bofors's largest order ever. The report said the money was paid into a Swiss bank account.    Officials at Bofors, Sweden's biggest maker of arms and munitions, didn't return telephone calls or were unavailable yesterday to comment on Mr. Ringberg's decision to investigate the company. Bofors is a unit of Nobel Industrier Sverige AB, a chemicals and consumer-products group.    Officials said they expect their inquiries to extend beyond the Indian contract. Mr. Ringberg indicated that he would examine Bofors's relationship with Tan Kok Cheng, the former general manager of Allied Ordinance of Singapore Pte. Ltd. The procurement company is owned 60% by Singapore's Defense Ministry and 40% by Bofors. On July 16, Singaporean officials charged Mr. Tan with taking about 4.5 million Singapore dollars ($2.1 million) in bribes from Bofors to help it set up an anti-aircraft-gun factory.    Last week, according to Swedish officials, Mr. Tan implicated three employees at Nobel Industrier in a scheme to receive bribery kickbacks.    Bofors already is at the center of several major inquiries into its business affairs and allegations that it circumvented Swedish export restrictions in selling weapons to countries engaged in war or likely to become involved in conflict. So far, two Bofors employees and an independent trader have been charged with crimes.    Since the first allegations emerged early this year that Bofors paid bribes to win the Indian contract, Indian politicians have been demanding a full-scale inquiry by Swedish authorities. Rumors that close associates of Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi may have received kickbacks for directing the order to Bofors have hurt his ruling Congress (I) Party.    Mr. Gandhi recently declared in India's parliament that neither he nor any family member received any illegal money.    Sweden's government has maintained that disclosing the names of participants in the Bofors sale would violate commercial secrecy, although Foreign Minister Sten Andersson has urged the company's management to volunteer the information.    In the case of Kongsberg, the Norwegian police official, Torg Johnson, a police chief in Drammen outside of Oslo, said the China sales were among more than 100 transactions that he has been reviewing to determine if Kongsberg violated export restrictions laid down by the Paris-based Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls, or Cocom.    Earlier this year, it was disclosed that Kongsberg, along with a unit of Toshiba Corp. of Japan, illicitly sold advanced milling equipment to the Soviet Union in 1982. The equipment enabled the Soviets to develop ultraquiet submarine propellers.    &quot;We are checking into every single sale of Kongsberg {equipment} to countries that are off-limits according to Cocom,&quot; Mr. Johnson said. He said he has accumulated more than 200,000 documents from Kongsberg and expects to conclude his investigation within a month. Kongsberg officials declined to comment. </TEXT></DOC>
