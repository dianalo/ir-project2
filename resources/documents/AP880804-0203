The 35-count indictment, charging racketeering, conspiracy andmail and wire fraud, named five top partners and employees ofPrinceton-Newport Partners, headquartered in Princeton, N.J., andNewport Beach Calif.   It also named a former trader in the high-yield bond departmentof Drexel in Beverly Hills, Calif.   The case, which grew out of the government's widespreadinvestigation of Wall Street insider trading, is the first tocharge brokerage officials under the Racketeer Influenced andCorrupt Organization Act, lawyers said.   That act, originally intended to fight organized crime and drugtrafficking, carries severe penalties, including up to 20 years inprison and the confiscation of property and earnings.   All those charged denied any wrongdoing in statements issuedthrough their attorneys, who characterized the indictment as apressure tactic to get the defendants' cooperation in the insidertrading investigation.   Named as defendants were James S. Regan, 46, a managing partnerof Princeton-Newport; Jack Z. Rabinowitz, 41, general partner;Charles M. Zarzecki, 40, partner and chief trader; Paul Berkman,41, partner and trader in Princeton-Newport Arbitrage Partners, asubsidiary of Princeton-Newport; Steven B. Smotrich, 33,comptroller of Princeton-Newport; and Bruce L. Newberg, 31,securities trader in Drexel's high-yield bond department untilearly this year.   Each was charged with one count of conspiracy, one count ofracketeering and one count of racketeering conspiracy. The fivePrinceton-Newport defendants also were charged with 32 counts ofmail and wire fraud. Newberg additionally was charged with 26counts of mail and wire fraud.   The charges arose from an alleged scheme involving the bogussale of securities between Princeton-Newport and Drexel to createmore than $13 million in phony tax losses and avoid regulatorydisclosure requirements. The indictment also alleges stockmanipulation from July 1, 1984 to the present.   The indictment alleged that to gain Drexel's assistance in thebogus trades, Princeton-Newport ``parked'' securities for Drexel tohelp Drexel hide certain holdings. The New Jersey firm also aidedDrexel in stock manipulation, the indictment charged.   ``This harmless activity has been twisted into a RICO chargesolely as a device to bludgeon these reputable people intotestifying against others,'' said Paul Grand, an attorney forZarzecki.   ``We're pawns in a much larger game,'' said Robert Schwartz, anattorney for Rabinowitz. ``When the elephants fight, it's the antsthat get slaughtered.''   Rudolph Giuliani, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of NewYork, responded to those allegations in a news conference, sayingthe indictment ``stands on its own.''   ``This is a multimillion-dollar crime,'' said Giuliani. ``Ithappened not once, not twice. It was a classic pattern of criminalactivity.''   But Giuliani declined to say whether any other Drexel officialsor the firm itself would be indicted.   Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder said ``Obviously, today'sindictment of Bruce Newberg, a former employee of the firm, isdeeply disturbing. We have only recently become acquainted withsome fo the allegations in the case. We have been informed by BruceNewberg's lawyer that he intends to plead not guilty. It would beunfair for us to prejudge the case or to comment further at thistime.''   The indictment also alleged Princeton-Newport conductedfraudulent trading activity through Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., butMerrill cooperated fully with the investigation and was not accusedof any wrongdoing.   The government's investigation of insider trading, which snaredspeculator Ivan Boesky in 1986, has been thought to focus morerecently on Drexel and specifically Michael Milken, the head of thefirm's high-yield bond department.   The indictment does not name Milken, but notes that Newbergreported directly to the head of the high-yield bond department.   Defense attorneys alleged the six defendants had been questionedearlier in the Drexel-related probe, and that the government hadoffered to drop the racketeering charges against them if the sixcooperated with investigators.   Giuliani said he could not comment on that allegation butrebuked what he characterized as irresponsible statements by thedefense lawyers.   ``This whole silliness is designed to deflect you from what thecase was all about,'' he told reporters.   If convicted on all counts, the defendants face 20 years inprison on each of the racketeering counts, five years in prison oneach of the remaining counts, and $250,000 in fines on each countfor a total of $18.75 million, the government said.   Also under the racketeering statute, the government could seekforfeiture of investments and interests of the defendants.</TEXT></DOC>
