<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-54-0319 </DOCNO><TEXT>The Sacramento Municipal Utility Distric (SMUD) photovoltaic project isa phased installation of a 100 megawatt central station photovoltaic(PV) power plant that is being constructed adjacent to the Rancho SecoNuclear Generating Station, 30 miles southeast of Sacramento, California.SMUD, with cofunding from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and theCalifornia State Department of Enrgy has designed, procured, installed,and operated two 1,000 kilowatt power generating plants (PV1 and PV2)as the first two phases of the project (Figure No. 1). PV1 deferred forbudgetary reasons and to evaluate new PV technologies. Long-range loadprojections for the SMUD service area indicate theneed for new peakingpower generation. Plans prior to the initiation of this project includedcoal-fired, hydroelectric and geothermal power plants. Environmentaland permitting constraints within California introduced considerableuncertainty into the timing and cost of other generation options. Thisprojectwas, therefore, initiated to proide an economic and technicalbasis for future electrical generation using solar energy. Ther performancedata presented herein was measured, stored, and reduced by the onsiteplant control and data acquisition computer.</TEXT></DOC>
