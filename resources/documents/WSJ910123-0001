A state court judge, finding that Lockheed Corp. didn'treceive a fair trial last year because one juror didn'treveal he had been convicted of a felony almost three decadesago, called for the case to be heard anew. Lockheed has saidit would have moved to exclude the juror had it known aboutthe conviction.</LP><TEXT>   Three ex-employees of the large aerospace concern claimedthey had been wrongfully fired for blowing the whistle onsafety problems with Lockheed's C-5B military transportplane. After seven days of jury deliberations in November,they were awarded $45.4 million. Now, though, &quot;it's a wholenew ball game,&quot; said Gordon Krischer, Lockheed's attorney.   Lawyers for the plaintiffs, saying that the courtdiscounted all of Lockheed's other arguments and would haveupheld the award of $45 million in punitive damages based onthe evidence presented, said they'd appeal.   &quot;As far as the merits of the case go, the ruling was aresounding success,&quot; said Phil Benson, an attorney in the lawoffices of Herbert Hafif, which represents two of the formerworkers. &quot;We are confident that we will prevail on the oneremaining legal issue, which doesn't involve the seriousfacts of this case.&quot;   Lockheed, in fact, also said it would appeal, in this caseto overturn the punitive damages award, which it termed&quot;outrageous.&quot; The company said it wants to continue to arguethe size of the damages so as &quot;to provide guidance to thecourt in a new trial.&quot;   Judge Harvey Schneider, in a 15-page order, called theissue surrounding the juror &quot;the most interesting anddifficult&quot; presented to the court. But, in the end, he said:&quot;Simply stated, Lockheed was entitled to rely on the {state}statute that no convicted felon would be seated as a juror.&quot;   The juror, an unemployed 52-year-old named Tresavan Owens,had indicated on a routine court affidavit that he never hadbeen convicted of a felony. But the company, by talking toother jurors, found out about his past shortly after thewrongful termination case ended.   Mr. Owens, records show, pleaded guilty in 1962 tostealing a few hundred dollars of phonographic equipment inLauderdale County, Miss. Yet there was also uncontestedevidence that Mr. Owens, who is black, was denied his SixthAmendment right to have a lawyer when he was convicted andsentenced to three years of hard labor at the statepenitentiary.   The plaintiffs argued that the 1963 landmark U.S. SupremeCourt ruling in Gideon vs. Wainwright, which guarantees theright to counsel for all defendants, rendered Mr. Owens'sconviction invalid. The Gideon decision, they said, isconsidered retroactive.   But the judge cited a 1980 Supreme Court case, Lewis vs.U.S., in which the high court stated that it was &quot;never heldthat an uncounseled conviction is invalid for all purposes.&quot;He added, &quot;While there is little doubt Owens would have beensuccessful in having his conviction set aside, the fact isthat he had not done so at the time he reported for juryduty.&quot;   While some legal scholars thought the judge would rule tokeep the verdict in place, Robert C. Post, a constitutionalscholar at the University of California at Berkeley, said heunderstood Judge Schneider's reasoning. &quot;Convictions are notautomatically void,&quot; Mr. Post pointed out. &quot;They arevoidable.&quot;   The issue of Mr. Owens failing to divulge the convictionbecame even more important because of the nature of theverdict. Mr. Kirscher noted that the punitive damages, whichmade up all but $400,000 of the award, were decided by a 9-3vote, the minimum required. Mr. Owens found for theplaintiffs.   Mr. Owens's lawyer, Paul Hoffman of the American CivilLiberties Union, said he was disappointed and would both helpwith the plaintiffs' appeal and seek to have his client'sconviction formally expunged. At a court hearing last week,Mr. Hoffman said Mr. Owens &quot;believes service on a jury is animportant right of citizenship.&quot;   Yet the issue of Mr. Owens's conviction was not the onlything the judge had to consider. Also important was thequestion: Did Mr. Owens's serving on the jury harm Lockheedin some way? To this, Judge Schneider found that the company&quot;undoubtedly would have been interested in the factssurrounding&quot; Mr. Owens's alleged crime because it &quot;may havereflected on his honesty.&quot;   That issue was especially relevant in this case, he said,because Lockheed had accused the workers of improperly takingcompany property -- scraps of metal -- from company premisesto independently investigate the C-5B.   Still, on all other grounds for appeal, Lockheed lost big.&quot;There was ample evidence in the record from which the jurycould have concluded that Lockheed discharged the plaintiffsbecause of the concerns they raised about the integrity ofthe C-5B airplane,&quot; Judge Schneider said. He also found thatthe punitive damages were appropriate in that theyrepresented about two-thirds of the profit earned by thecompany on the four airplanes that the plaintiffs contendedhad flaws.   The company maintains the planes are perfectly safe, andexpressed confidence it would prevail in a new trial. But ifJudge Schneider's ruling about Mr. Owens is upheld and thecase is tried again, Lockheed could have even more evidenceto overcome. Since the verdict, additional allegations havesurfaced that the Air Force may have not inspected the C-5Bsas intently as it said it did. Congress continues to lookinto the matter.</TEXT></DOC>
