This work has focused on the useof carbon filters, primarily for power plant applications. More recently,the use of silver-containing sorbents has been the subject of considerableresearch. The most recent work in the United States has addressed theuse of silver-exchanged faujasites and mordenites. The chemical reactionsof iodine with silver on the sorbent are not well defined, but it isgenerally believed that chemisorbed iodides and iodates are formed. Theprocess for iodine recovery generally involves passage of the iodine-ladengas stream through a packed bed of the adsorbent material preheated toa temperature of about 150{degree}C. Most iodine removal system designsutilizing silver-containing solid sorbents assume only a 30 to 50% silverutilization. Based on laboratory tests, potentially 60 to 70% of thesilver contained in the sorbents can be reacted with iodine. To overcomethe high cost of silver associated with these materials, various approacheshave been explored. Among these are the regeneration of the silver-containingsorbent by stripping the iodine and trapping the iodine on a sorbentthat has undergone only partial silver exchange and is capable of attaininga much higher silver utilization. This summary report describes the USwork in regeneration of iodine-loaded solid sorbent material. In addition,the report discusses the broader subject of plant off-gas treatment includingsystem design. The off-gas technologies to recovery No{sub x} and torecover and dispose of Kr, {sup 14}C, and I are described as to theirimpacts on the design of an integrated off-gas system. The effect ofventilation philosophy for the reprocessing plant is discussed as anintegral part of the overall treatment philosophy of the plant off-gas.103 refs., 5 figs., 8 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
