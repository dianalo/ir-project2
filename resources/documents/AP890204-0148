(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Rail traffic resumed Saturday through thesite of a train collision and explosion, but nearby residents foundrepairing damage to their homes difficult with the high temperaturereaching only minus 18.   A spokeswoman for Montana Rail Link Inc. said workers had clearedportions of the wreckage and reopened one of the two tracks.   The explosion Thursday morning of a railroad car containinghydrogen peroxide shattered windows up to two miles away and hurleddebris hundreds of yards. Thousands of homes were without power forseveral hours after the crash.   Twenty-one runaway freight cars derailed in the collision withthree locomotives.   About 2,000 people were evacuated from a square-mile area aroundthe blast as thick black smoke poured from a railroad car containingplastics that ignited. The evacuation order was lifted Thursdaynight, and many residents returned home to find broken windows,frozen pipes and flooded basements.   Officials of nearby Carroll College, whose buildings were damagedby flying debris, asked residents to house about 200 studentstemporarily. One dormitory will be closed for at least a month, andclasses won't resume until Feb. 13.   Some families took refuge with friends or at local motels overthe weekend as they waited for repairs by plumbers, glaziers andfurnace-repair people, who said they were swamped with business.   One plumber began turning away customers Thursday night, while asecond reported a waiting list of at least 15 customers by Friday.   Sharon Prinzing, Montana Rail Link's personnel manager, said theshort-line railroad was recording names of claimants and planned towork directly with insurance companies to settle the claims.   One resident whose home was damaged said the railroad companyshould immediately settle the claims.   ``I'm going to have to come up with money, cash, for sleeping inmy own bed,'' said Wilbur Raymond. ``That's just not fair.''   Raymond said several windows were shattered at his house,including one in a solar greenhouse. Several citrus trees in thegreenhouse died, he said.   About a dozen federal officials are investigating the accident.They will examine the railroad cars to see whether the brakes failedor were set improperly, and will talk with the four crew membersinvolved. Urine samples were taken from the crew members to test fordrugs and alcohol.   The runaway cars were part of a freight train that stopped nearthe Continental Divide to switch locomotives after a locomotive cabheater failed. The cars slipped away during the switching procedureand rolled nine miles before slamming into the three locomotives.</TEXT></DOC>
