The government said Attorney General Enrique Alvarez delCastillo delivered the warning to U.S. Attorney General RichardThornburgh on Wednesday.   Dr. Humberto Alvarez Machain, a suspect in the 1985torture-slaying of U.S. drug agent Enrique ``Kiki'' Camarena, wasarrested April 3 in El Paso, Texas. He had reportedly beenkidnapped at his Guadalajara office the previous day.   Some news reports have said Alvarez Machain was kidnapped bybounty hunters seeking a $100,000 reward offered by the U.S. DrugEnforcement Adminstration. The agency has refused to comment on howhe arrived in the United States.   Other reports say Mexican federal police took Alvarez Machain tothe United States. The Mexican attorney general's office deniesthis and the government said Tuesday it had asked the U.S. StateDepartment to explain how he was apprehended.   Another investigation has been opened by Mexico's Congress,where lawmakers are complaining of an affront to their country'ssovereignty.   Alvarez del Castillo and Thornburgh met Wednesday during aregional drug enforcement conference.   ``The Mexican attorney general told the U.S. official that it isthe exclusive province of Mexican authorities to fight narcoticstrafficking in all its forms within its own territory,'' thegovernment said in a statement.   ``If it is proved that the suspect was kidnapped and illegallytaken to the United States by authorities of that country, itendangers the bilateral cooperation in the fight against drugtrafficking, which until now have been excellent,'' the statementsaid.   Thornburgh says he has ordered an investigation into the case.   The Los Angeles Times on Wednesday quoted unnamed Mexicansources as saying Alvarez Machain's abduction was arranged byagents in the Los Angeles DEA office without the knowledge of theirsuperiors in Washington.   Alvarez Machain, 42, is one of 19 Mexicans indicted by a federalgrand jury in Los Angeles on charges of kidnapping, torturing andkilling Camarena, a DEA special agent. He was arraigned earlierthis month and pleaded innocent.   U.S. prosecutors allege that Camarena was abducted by drugtraffickers and tortured by Mexican officials about DEA activitiesin Mexico and charges against suspected participants in theabduction and murder have strained U.S.-Mexican relations.   U.S. law enforcement officials say Mexico failed to respond totheir requests to extradite several defendants. Mexican officialssay the United States had never requested the extradition of anyone.   A Jan. 31 indictment returned in Los Angeles contained thelatest charges in the case. Besides Alvarez Machain, it namedManuel Ibarra Herrera, former director of the Mexican FederalJudicial Police, and Miguel Aldana Ibarra, former head of theMexican office of Interpol, the international law enforcementagency.   Alvarez Machain's lawyer, Robert Steinberg, says his client waskidnapped but that he would not raise the abduction as a legalissue because prior rulings in similar cases said, in effect, ``toobad, but they're here.''   Steinberg said Alvarez Machain was taken from his Guadalajaraoffice on April 2 by five men who identified themselves as Mexicanfederal police and told the gynecologist he was under arrest forperforming illegal abortions.   He said that the next day the group placed Alvarez Machain on aplane to El Paso, where he was arrested by a DEA agent.   They say fingerprints on a syringe used to drug Camarena weretraced to Alvarez Machain, who allegedly revived the DEA agent whenhe lost consciousness after being beaten.   Alvarez Machain is to face trial in Los Angeles on May 1 alongwith four other defendants in the case.</TEXT></DOC>
