First, each chair of private enterprise andentrepreneurship is a unique entity, established by aneducational institution with funding from one or more donors.Each has its own objectives, and its character generally isderived from the individual who holds the chair. Since Ipersonally know a number of the chairholders, I can say thatamong this group are individuals dedicated to research andscholarship, to generating programs for student audiences aswell as public forums, to teaching in the classrooms on theircampuses, and some who may do all of the above.</LP><TEXT>   These chairs are part of a much broader effort to educateAmericans about how the private-enterprise system works andhow it might be improved to benefit each citizen. Perhaps arole that differentiates chairs of private enterprise orentrepreneurship from the think tanks Mr. Wooster hasdescribed is that chairholders frequently assumeresponsibility for taking economic research, wherevergenerated, and translating it for presentation to the publicand, particularly, to our young people. It is all toofrequent that individuals cloistered in research environmentsfocus on very narrow topics, the findings of which havelittle or no application to the real world. Chairholders neednot apologize for believing it is important to work withelementary and secondary schoolteachers to better preparethem to teach our children about our institutions and thetools of analysis and critical thinking.   I find it a rare case in which a chair's only purpose isto expound a particular ideology. Indeed, I am sure Mr.Wooster is well aware that many of the first-rate researchorganizations to which he referred, including his own ReasonFoundation, are not immune from being described in the pressas &quot;right wing&quot; or &quot;conservative&quot; think tanks, a label withwhich they may or may not agree. Labels are one means ofattempting to discredit individuals, groups or products. Idraw a very simple conclusion. There is so much to be donewith respect to improving our private-enterprise system thatno single group can accomplish this objective. It isunfortunate Mr. Wooster has taken the tack of negativecampaigning: trying to get ahead by distorting the goals,activities and achievements of others. I believe thatresearch organizations, university chairs and public andprivate schoolteachers all have distinct and important rolesto fill in improving our economic well-being.   Francis W. Rushing   President   Association of Private-Enterprise Education   Professor of Economics   Georgia State University   Atlanta   ---   Research shows that activities of &quot;entrepreneurship&quot;centers are oriented toward research, not away, as withprivate-enterprise centers as Mr. Wooster mentions. HerbertKierulff (1985) found 11 chairs specifically mentioning&quot;entrepreneurship&quot; in the title. Of the 11, the majoritymentioned research in their mission.   Mr. Wooster's statement that &quot;no one offers doctorates infree enterprise or entrepreneurship&quot; is incorrect. I am aPh.D. candidate at the University of Pittsburgh Joseph M.Katz Graduate School of Business, and my area ofconcentration is Entrepreneurship and Marketing. I know ofseveral others across the country who have also combined astudy of entrepreneurship with one of the more traditionalareas of study. Interest in the advanced study on this topicis growing and students of today will be conducting researchon the topic of entrepreneurship in the future.   Cynthia Iannarelli   Training Coordinator   Small Business Development Center   University of Pittsburgh   Pittsburgh   ---   By describing chairs in &quot;free enterprise&quot; and&quot;entrepreneurship&quot; as if they were the same thing, Mr.Wooster failed to recognize the clear differences betweenthem and erroneously attributed the alleged flaws of theformer to both.   As he correctly indicated, chairs carrying thefree-enterprise title are funded principally to fosterpro-market, pro-capitalist positions. Chairs inentrepreneurship, in contrast, are funded primarily to fosterconcerns for risk-taking, whether in the formation of newenterprises or in the renewal and revitalization of existingones.   While it is certainly arguable that free-enterpriseeconomies tend to stimulate more entrepreneurial activity,the fact remains that the study of entrepreneurship is notsynonymous with espousing pro-capitalist positions. As Mr.Wooster noted, Beloit College's Prof. Jerry Gustafson, whoholds a chair in entrepreneurship, stated that the foundationfunding him &quot;isn't interested in being ideological at all.&quot;   Given Mr. Wooster's final paragraph, it is clear that hisreal message is that those who want to espousefree-enterprise positions would be better off fundingorganizations such as the Cato Institute rather thansupporting chairs at universities. Perhaps he is right.However, making the same case for not supporting chairs inentrepreneurship is an altogether different story.   Richard R. West   Dean   Leonard N.
