Each of the Funds is a diversified, open-end, management investmentcompany registered under the 1940 Act. TOC acts as principal underwriterof each of the Funds. TOC is the investment adviser of Cardinal. CardinalManagement Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of TOC, is the investment adviserof Cardinal Government Guaranteed and Cardinal Tax-Exempt.Applicants have requested that any order issued by the Commission alsoextend to all other investment companies: (1) Organized after the initialfiling of the application, (2) having a common investment adviser or principalunderwriter or having investment advisers or principal underwriters whichare under common control with the offering company, (3) holding themselvesout to investors as related companies for purposes of investment or investorservices, and (4) having the same exchange offers and load characteristicsdescribed herein (``Additional Funds''). 2. TOC maintains a continuous public offering of shares of Cardinal Governmentand Cardinal Tax Exempt (together called the ``No-Load Funds'') at theirrespective current net asset value without a sales charge and also maintainsa continuous public offering of shares of Cardinal and Cardinal GovernmentGuaranteed (together called the ``Load Funds'') at their respective currentnet asset value plus a sales charge. The sales charge for Cardinal beginsat 8.5% for purchase of less than $10,000 and decreases at different break-pointsthrough purchases of $500,000 or more, where the sales charge is 1%. Thesales charge for Cardinal Government Guaranteed begins at 4.75% for purchasesof less than $100,000 and decreases at different breakpoints through purchasesof $1,000,000 or more, where the sales charge is 1%. Each of the Load Fundshas a special charge for certain purchasers which are trusts qualifyingunder section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 which begins at4.75% for purchases of less than $100,000 and decreases at different breakpointsthrough purchases of $500,000 or more, where the sales charge or load is1%. There is no sales charge imposed on reinvestment of dividends and capitalgains paid on shares of the Funds. 3. Not more often than once each calendar quarter, upon written authorizationof TOC and payment of a nominal administrative fee (currently $5.00 foreach of the Funds) shareholders of the Funds may exchange some part of,or all of their currently-owned shares of one of the Funds (the ``ExchangedSecurities'') for shares of another one of the Funds (the ``Acquired Securities'').4. The exchange shall be effected on the basis of the relative net assetvalues of the Exchanged Securities and the Acquired Securities at the timeof the exchange, except that a sales load shall be charged equal in amountto any difference between the sales load then chargeable upon purchaseof the Acquired Securities in the absence of an exchange and the salesload previously paid upon the purchase of the Exchanged Securities. 5. In calculating the sales load previously paid upon the purchase of theExchanged Securities and the sales load then chargeable upon purchase ofthe Acquired Securities in the absence of an exchange (i) where the ExchangedSecurities represent less than all of the shares in one of the Funds beingexchanged, the security upon which the highest sales load was previouslypaid is deemed to be exchanged first, (ii) where the Exchanged Securitieswere acquired through reinvestment of dividends or capital gains distributions,the Exchanged Securities are deemed to have been acquired with a salesload equal to the sales load previously paid on the securities on whichthe dividend was paid or distribution made, (iii) if the Exchanged Securitiesthemselves had been acquired pursuant to an exchange or exchanges withone or more of the Funds, the sum of the sales previously paid on the ExchangedSecurities and the previously exchanged securities shall be deemed to bethe sales load previously paid upon purchase of the Exchanged Securities,and (iv) all applicable provisions for reduced sales charges will be consideredin determining the sales charge applicable to the purchase of the AcquiredSecurities and any such reductions in sales charges will be made in accordancewith the conditions of Rule 22d-1 under the 1940 Act. 6. More than 97% of the Funds' shares sold on an annual basis are soldby TOC. Less than 3% of the Funds' shares sold on an annual basis are soldby broker-dealers which sell such shares pursuant to agreements with TOC(``Selected Dealers''). 7. TOC will not initiate a general telephone solicitation to current shareholdersof the Funds to inform them of the exchange privilege or to actively solicitan exchange, nor will its representatives solicit Fund shareholders onan individual basis except on the infrequent occasion when the circumstancesof a particular individual account suggest that an exchange would be inthe best interests of the individual shareholder and the exchange is madeat the request of the shareholder. 8. TOC has in place a program to review all purchases and sales of sharesof the Funds, including exchanges where a commission is paid to one ofTOC's registered representatives. Officers of TOC monitor the informationgenerated by such program to insure compliance with the Securities ExchangeAct of 1934 and the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Rulesof Fair Practice and TOC believes that such a program will identify excessiveexchanges which may not be in the best interests of, or suitable for, theexchanging shareholders. 9. Shareholders of the Funds will be notified of the Funds' exchange program,including any administrative fee which may be imposed on exchange transactions,by means of the Funds' prospectuses and by means of other communications,including sales literature and other advertising that describe the exchangeprogram. Any such communication describing the Funds' exchange programwill include notification of any administrative fee related thereto. <ITAG tagnum="84">Applicants' Legal Conclusions </ITAG>1. The purpose of the administrative fee is to defray the Funds' administrativeexpenses incurred in exchange transactions. 2. The purpose of the proposed exchange program is to permit shareholdersof the Funds who change their investment objectives to exchange, in a simpletransaction, their shares in one of the Funds for the shares of anotherFund on an equitable basis. If an exchange from one of the No-Load Fundsto one of the Load Funds were made at relative net asset value withouta sales charge, then the distribution system of the Load Funds would bedisrupted because an investor could easily avoid the sales charge of theLoad Funds by first purchasing one of the No-Load Funds and then exchangingthe shares so acquired for shares of one of the Load Funds that are otherwisesold with a sales charge. 3. The exchange program complies with the terms and conditions of Rule11a-3 under the 1940 Act, as proposed in Investment Company Act ReleaseNo. 16504, July 29, 1988. <ITAG tagnum="84">Applicants' Conditions </ITAG>If the requested order is granted, the Applicants agree to the followingconditions: 1. The administrative fee or any scheduled variation thereof will be uniformlyapplied to all shareholders participating in the exchange program. 2. Any variation in sales charges on sales of shares of the Funds, by meansof exchanges or otherwise, will be effectuated in accordance with Rule22d-1 under the 1940 Act. 3. Applicants will comply with the terms and conditions of proposed Rule11a-3 under the 1940 Act, if and when the proposed rule is adopted. 4. Any future offers of exchange involving any Additional Funds will besubjected to the representations and conditions described in this application.5. In the event that Applicants modify or terminate the exchange privilege,notice of the modification or termination will be provided to the shareholdersof the Funds in writing not less than 60 days in advance of such modificationor termination (unless the modification is to reduce the administrativefee). The Funds will disclose the right to modify or terminate the exchangeprivilege in their prospectuses. Prior to any future modification (butnot termination) of the exchange privilege, Applicant will apply to theCommission for an amendment of the order requested by this application.<ITAG tagnum="21">For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, underdelegated authority. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jonathan G.Katz, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Secretary. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 88-27058 Filed 11-22-88; 8:45 am] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 8010-01-M </ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
