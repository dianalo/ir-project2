Last week Justice Souter's fifth votewas crucial to the outcome of the Supreme Court decision inRust v. Sullivan. The most controversial of all the casesheard this term by the court, the Rust opinion simultaneouslyreins in a disobedient federal bureaucracy, rules thatfederal judges have no business setting aside decisionscommitted to the executive, further limits the putativeabortion &quot;right,&quot; and fundamentally clarifies First Amendmentlaw to give every level of government control of its ownresources. Not bad for a day's work.   At issue in Rust were regulations issued by the Departmentof Health and Human Services in 1988 that expresslyprohibited family planning clinics receiving federal fundsfrom counseling for or advocating abortion. HHS did not issuethese regulations happily: Federal bureaucracies often resistpresidential direction, but HHS on this issue was especiallyobstinate. For 17 years during the Nixon, Ford, Carter andearly Reagan administrations, civil servants at HHS managedto interpret an express congressional prohibition on the useof federal funds &quot;where abortion is a method of familyplanning&quot; to not only permit abortion counseling with suchfunds, but actually to require it. This was too much forPresident Reagan, and he ordered that the regulations berevised in accordance with the law.</LP><TEXT>   Presidential orders of this sort are salutory things. Ifnothing else, they serve as reminders that it is the electedpresident -- not the unelected bureaucracy -- that is chargedby the Constitution to &quot;take care that the laws be faithfullyexecuted.&quot; In last week's decision, Chief Justice WilliamRehnquist writing for the majority very properly deferred tothen-HHS Secretary Otis Bowen's implementation of thepresident's order. Rust also made quick work of the claimthat the right to abortion conferred by Roe v. Wade alsorequires the federal government to fund abortion counseling.&quot;That an activity may be constitutionally protected,&quot; themajority ruled, &quot;does not give rise to a constitutional dutyto subsidize it.&quot; Since the rise of the welfare state it hasfrequently been argued that fundamental rights just are notworth having unless they are federally bankrolled. But theBill of Rights is a safeguard against federal power, not aninvitation to raid the federal treasury.   The court's handling of the abortion issue in Rust was anatural extension of its doubt that the right to abortion canbe found in the Constitution at all. In light of itssanctioning of state restrictions on the use of publichospitals or public personnel for abortion procedures in1989's Webster v. Director of Reproductive Services, themajority of the Rust court stated that it &quot;would strainlogic&quot; to find that the exclusion of abortion counseling froma federal program was unconstitutional.   Similarly, the court denied that a world without federalabortion services would upset traditional doctor-patientrelationships, which after all, can be established outsidethe confines of federal programs. While the court is still astep away from overruling Roe, the significant presence ofDavid Souter among the majority suggests that the step isindeed a small one. Justice Harry Blackmun, the inventor ofthe abortion right, observed as much in his dissent.   As important as the greater respect for unborn life thatRust may portend surely is, the decision is also something ofa First Amendment landmark. Up to now, the court has confusedgovernment suppression of speech and government promotion ofpolicy. The First Amendment prohibits government censorship.It says nothing about what policies the government must adoptor encourage. Nevertheless, liberal legal commentators arguedthat somehow the First Amendment requires that the governmentfund all points of view equally or that government policy beentirely neutral.   That theory is a certain prescription for paralysis andcivic anarchy. It would mean that the National Endowment forthe Arts is obliged to fund exotic pornographic dancing if itsupports the ballet, or that the local public school couldmake no meaningful curricular choices. A First Amendmenttheory premised on &quot;neutrality&quot; is not value neutral. Quitethe contrary, it operates from a profoundly flawedindifference to the quality of literature, art, politicaltheory and, ultimately, moral choice.   Rust has little difficulty putting an end to such academicsophistry. To the charge that prohibiting abortion counselingwas an unconstitutional condition on a government benefit,the court plainly responded that, no, it was merely acondition on the use of public funds. The family planningrecipients of federal funds are free to use their separate,private resources for abortion counseling or anything theylike.   To the allegation that the government is not viewpointneutral, the court effectively admitted as much, and observedthat if such is evidence of unconstitutionality, much thegovernment does is &quot;suspect.&quot; In the court's words, &quot;{w}henCongress established the National Endowment for Democracy toencourage other countries to adopt democratic principles, itwas not constitionally required to fund a program toencourage competing lines of political philosophy such asCommunism and Fascism.&quot;   So too, with the Rust case decided, Congress canconfidently and constitutionally recognize the significantdifference between planning a family and counseling someoneto destroy one of that family's members.   ---   Mr. Kmiec, an assistant attorney general in the Reaganadministration, is professor of law at the University ofNotre Dame and a fellow of the Indiana Policy ReviewFoundation.</TEXT></DOC>
