The FAA said in a statement that production delays have put theprogram three years behind schedule, but the agency remainscommitted to using the new microwave landing systems at major U.S.airports in 1998 and at all airports around the year 2000.   Hazeltine has delivered two of the 178 landing systems calledfor in the contract since beginning work in 1984. One has beeninstalled at the Lebanon, N.H., airport.   The agency said it would buy 26 systems from other sources, testthat equipment and a decision on how to move ahead ``will dependupon successful completion of the evaluation program.'' The FAAsaid it plans to award a new contract in 1991.   A spokesman for Hazeltine's parent company, Emerson ElectricCorp., said the company plans to file suit contesting the decision.The spokesman said problems, including payments and timing ofdeliveries, were the result of changes the FAA made in the contractafter it was awarded.   ``The contract changes required by the FAA over several yearsare so numerous and substantial that they have fundementallyaltered the nature and the cost of the contract,'' said thespokesman, who asked that his name not be used.   The system uses high-frequency microwaves to direct planes tolandings, allowing them to make curved and steeper approachesoutside the strict paths necessary under the current instrumentlanding system. Virtually immune to weather, the system canincrease an airport's flight capacity and helps planes avoidresidential areas.   Air carriers have been reluctant to support the microwavesystem, saying it isn't much better than the current system.   The FAA in June warned that Hazeltine's contract was in dangerof being canceled because of production problems. Hazeltine hadsaid the price of the contract was too low and ``entered anunauthorized work slowdown last August,'' Dick Arnold, head of theFAA's microwave landing system program, said in June.   The company was given a delay in a decision on the contract inJuly to see if it could find another firm to it over, but no suchcontractor was found, according to the FAA.   The agency had been planning on putting new microwave systems atthe Laconia and Manchester airports in New Hampshire, but FAAspokesman John Leyden has said that because of the delays it mayput early systems at high-profile, high-volume airports such asJohn F. Kennedy International in New York.   The FAA plans to buy 750 of the new systems, if Congressapproves.</TEXT></DOC>
