The explosion, early Friday South Pacific time, drew immediatefire from Prime Minister Geoffrey Palmer of New Zealand, who saidFrance seemed determined to continue testing no matter what it costin terms of relations with the South Pacific.   The blast released a force of less than 12 kilotons, the ministrysaid in a communique. That is slightly more than half the power ofthe World War II bomb that destroyed Hiroshima.   A kiloton is equal to the explosive force of 1,000 tons of TNT.   On Saturday, France made its first announcement of a nuclearexplosion in 15 years after detonating a 15-kiloton device.President Francois Mitterrand pledged a new policy of openness lastmonth during a visit to French Polynesia.   The world previously learned of French tests from New Zealand,which has monitored France's nuclear program from an observationstation in the Cook Islands.   Palmer commented on Friday, ``From New Zealand's point of view,the only announcement we want to hear is that they are stoppingtesting.''   He said, ``They already know that their nuclear tests arerejected by all countries of the region. However, we will continueto make this point unmistakably clear every time they explode one oftheir nuclear devices.''   Premier Michel Rocard said recently France would reduce thenumber of nuclear tests each year at Mururoa from eight to six.</TEXT></DOC>
