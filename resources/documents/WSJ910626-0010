Many of themmissed this year's U.S. stock rally. To make matters worse,they didn't get to ride the dollar's explosive rise.   Guess what? They're still not crazy about U.S. shares, atleast not at their current levels. For the most part, theirfavorite stocks are right at home in Europe.</LP><TEXT>   The U.S. market &quot;looks expensive&quot; as stock prices alreadyreflect an economic recovery, says Iain Watt, Edinburgh-basedinvestment director for Edinburgh Fund Managers PLC.   With the Dow Jones Industrial Average near 3,000, &quot;therisk of a 15% correction is greater now than a 5% rise,&quot; saysClaude N. Zwick, head of foreign securities trading forCredit Suisse.   Mr. Zwick's case: Money managers' cash levels in the U.S.are at a 10-year low; stock prices at 2.6 times book valueare historically high; and the 18 times earnings that theStandard andamp; Poor's 500 Stock Index is selling at is too steepfor his liking. (Book value is assets minus liabilities.)   There's more. &quot;Long-term interest rates have been risingto where bonds {in the U.S.} have become more attractive thanstocks,&quot; considering that stocks are riskier. And he thinksinvestors are too complacent in expecting a long-lasting U.S.economic recovery. They may get &quot;a double-dip recession&quot;instead, he figures, with the economy rising in the thirdquarter, only to relapse in late 1991 and early 1992.   A pervasive fear among European managers is that as theU.S. economy recovers, interest rates will rise, choking offthe stock-market rally. &quot;The {U.S.} equity market went up onexpectations of lower interest rates,&quot; says Wolfhard Graetz,chief executive of Vontobel Asset Management Ltd. &quot;Nowsuddenly bond yields aren't coming down but turning around.This could be the straw which breaks the camel's back.&quot;   Felix Zulauf, president of Zulauf Asset Management Ltd.,thinks monetary policy throughout the industrial world is tootight, something he fears could send all stock markets lower.U.S. stocks, he predicts, will fall at least 10%.   A pullback by Japanese investors could injure U.S.markets, Mr. Zulauf suggests. He notes that the Japanese arelarge holders of dollar-denominated bonds, that their stockmarket is very weak and that their banks get squeezedwhenever Japanese stocks fall or the dollar rises.   Currently, Mr. Zulauf is using futures contracts to sellshort the Sandamp;P 500, betting on a general decline in U.S. stockprices. He is also shorting individual stocks, such asProcter andamp; Gamble, Johnson andamp; Johnson and Walt Disney. Hefigures that these &quot;darlings of institutional investors&quot; willsee their high price/earnings ratios deflate if U.S. interestrates rise. &quot;In addition, they have large foreign exchangeincome, which is worth less with a rising dollar.&quot;   By contrast, European managers see some favorable signs inEurope. Interest rates on the continent are likely to fall aseconomic growth slows, many of them believe. Mr. Zwick notesthat the German and French markets, among others, have yet toreach the highs they set before the Persian Gulf War began inJanuary. (By contrast, the U.S. and British markets alreadyhave.) Credit Suisse analysts also see indications thateconomic conditions in eastern Germany -- now a moribundlocale -- will improve in 1992.   So, what to buy? Mr. Zwick likes cyclical stocks,including Volkswagen and two big capital goods companies:Thyssen and Mannesmann. His favorite among the German banks,which should benefit from falling interest rates, isBayerische Vereins bank. And he recommends big German bluechips such as electrical giant Siemens, Deutsche Bank andauto maker Daimler-Benz.   In France, Mr. Zwick has two &quot;cheap&quot; favorites in automaker Peugeot and tiremaker Cie. Generale des EstablissementsMichelin. He likes Cie. Financiere de Paribas, a bankingcompany, and Cie. Financiere de Suez, a holding company withinterests in finance, industry and real estate.   Mr. Graetz of Vontobel is playing themes. To takeadvantage of the industrial world's aging populations, hispicks include drug companies Glaxo Holdings in Britain andRoche Holding in Switzerland.   Partly as plays on European integration, he is drawn torailway-related stocks. These include Bombardier, a Canadianrail car maker, and BBC Brown Boveri, a Swiss company thatbuilds engines and rail cars as well as power transmissionequipment. &quot;Trains, which were deemed to be an old-fashionedtransportation method, have shown they can competeeffectively for 600-700 kilometers at current speeds,&quot; saysGeorges-Andre Cuendet, chief economist at Darier Hentsch andamp;Cie. in Geneva.   Erich Stock, director of equities at Shearson LehmanGlobal Asset Management Ltd. in London, likes medium-sizedEuropean companies with strong growth potential. In Germany,he is buying Krones, a maker of bottling machinery, which hesays is a world leader in a niche business, and Jungheinrich,a fork-lift manufacturer that &quot;is very close to its clientsand offers very good after-service.&quot; In Italy, Mr. Stockfavors Ericsson S.p.A., a telecommunications companycontrolled by the Swedish giant with the same name, andTeleco Cavi, a cable manufacturer specializing in fiber opticcables.   What would it take to entice Europe's fund mangers to giveU.S. stocks a fatter share of their portfolios? &quot;A 15%correction would. . .bring the Europeans back into the U.S.market they missed,&quot; says Mr. Zwick of Credit Suisse.   Mr. Watt of Edinburgh says foreign investors want to seethe U.S. budget deficit reduced. He suggests a fuel tax thatraises gas prices to $2 a gallon. &quot;If you did that, I'd be amajor buyer of the U.S. market,&quot; he says.   Even without such inducements, money managers concede theU.S. stock market is too big to ignore. For example, Mr.Graetz of Vontobel is betting on emerging growth companies bybuying the T. Rowe Price New Horizons Fund.   Bank Julius Baer andamp; Co. is mildly bullish on U.S. stocks.Based on a sluggish U.S. recovery, its buy list includessteady growth issues such as Philip Morris, Coca-Cola and EliLilly, plus interest-rate-sensitive shares like FederalNational Mortgage Association, BankAmerica and insurerAmerican International Group.   Heinrich Looser, head of private banking at Bank JuliusBaer, thinks the U.S. market could still climb another 10% to15%. He thinks political tensions in the Soviet Union and therest of Eastern Europe could unsettle European financialmarkets, while he expects the Bush administration topump-prime the economy going into the 1992 U.S. elections.&quot;Compared to the rest of the world,&quot; he argues, &quot;the U.S.looks attractive.&quot;   ---                  A European Smorgasbord                                                                                                          Here are some favorite investments at the moment of fourEuropean money managers.
