Since then a total of nine small-scale pilot units,with the exception of Yangbajain, using underground thermal water forelectricity generation, have been constructed in different parts of China.All of these localities are already covered by regional electric grids;these units cannot be run safely, steadily and continuously, so it isnot possible to attach great importance to these miniplants. Based ontheir operating experience and thermodynamic and economic analyses inthe present technological conditions, it appears that a geothermal waterwith temperature well below 100{sup 0}C is favorable only to non-electricuses, except in remote areas with an extreme shortage of conventionalenergy sources. At present the State and local governments take onlythe Yangbajain geothermal field seriously. The significant achievementsin Yangbajain have certainly been made possible by a number of conditions:a serious lack of oil and coal, and a great difficulty in developingthe Xizang hydropower resources, for which an enormous capital investmentis evidently needed; hydrothermal resources are present all over theXizang plateau, usually at relatively shallow depths and consequentlymore convenient for exploration and exploitation; a willingness on thepart of geothermal experts from the hinterlands of China to explore thisnew energy resource. In addition, the scientific significance of thegeothermal phenomena in Xizang Plateau is of considerable interest tomay geoscientists and engineers.</TEXT></DOC>
