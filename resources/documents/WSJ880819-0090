The public didn't get the information until the stock market closed three hours later. No one thought twice about the sneak previews, long a practice among Japanese companies.    Not anymore. The Tokyo Stock Exchange recently pressured the camera maker to scrap the cozy lunches because the early sessions gave favored shareholders access to information that could move share prices before public disclosure.    &quot;If the information is delicate there's a chance it could leak. We have to try to eliminate the chance for insider trading,&quot; says a senior Canon official.    A recent wave of scandals involving possible insider trading is forcing the Japanese to take action to curb shady practices. But unlike the U.S., where insider trading cases produce headline-grabbing court battles, the Japanese authorities are tackling the problem in typically Japanese fashion: They are determined to clean up the market through social pressure based on a fear of losing face, an education campaign featuring seminars, lectures and pamphlets, and lots of behind-the-scenes guidance. Critics say this means radical changes won't happen overnight.    The idea that insider trading is wrong is only beginning to take root here. Japan's business environment rewards those who forge close relationships with bankers and brokers. Obtaining inside information over drinks is considered part of the job.    So it took foreign pressure, primarily from the U.S., combined with a widely publicized case of dubious trading last year to awaken the Japanese government to the need to close the loopholes in its securities regulations.    Last September, in the so-called Tateho incident, executives at Hanshin Sogo Bank Ltd. were suspected of selling shares in advance of news that Tateho Chemical Industries Co., a medium-sized chemical company, had sustained huge losses in government bond futures trading. But an investigation by the Osaka Securities Exchange concluded that while some of the trading was suspicious, it fell into a gray legal area that couldn't be prosecuted.    The Tateho incident prompted Japan's parliament to revise the Securities and Exchange Law in May. The new law, which goes into effect next spring, defines insider trading and gives the Ministry of Finance greater investigative powers. Even so, no one expects shady trading habits to end immediately.    &quot;We aren't talking about just changing the law. We're talking about changing the way people do business,&quot; says Stephen P. Swope, managing director at Kidder Peabody International Corp. in Tokyo. &quot;There will be stops and starts along the way.&quot;    The new law represents progress, but analysts say Japan's awareness of insider trading is about 20 years behind that of the U.S. Seijirou Watanabe, a lawyer who represents small investors, says one reason for the lax attitude is that Japanese laws and enforcement procedures are designed to protect the securities industry, not individual investors. &quot;The attitude is that you know there is insider trading and you buy stocks knowing that's how the market is. If you don't like it, don't buy stocks,&quot; says Mr. Watanabe.    But awareness of possible insider trading has been sharpened by the most recent case. On July 29 at 4:00 p.m., Nippon Steel Corp., the world's largest steelmaker, announced it would buy 18.1% of Sankyo Seiki Manufacturing Co.'s shares for about 53 billion yen ($396 million). That morning, Sankyo Seiki's share price rose sharply in heavy trading. Trading was suspended in the afternoon.    &quot;Now, salarymen are talking about it {insider trading} on the trains in the morning,&quot; says Mr. Watanabe.    The Tokyo Stock Exchange is investigating if senior executives of the two companies bought stock based on inside information in advance of the announcement. While refusing to comment on the status of the investigation, Takashi Matsukawa, director of the secondary market division at the Ministry of Finance, says, &quot;We hope this serves as a shock to other issuers.&quot;    Legal experts say that because the new law hasn't gone into effect, even if there is evidence of insider trading the Ministry of Finance isn't likely to do more than slap the executives on the wrist and order them to improve internal controls.    On the other hand, critics say the heat will be on the authorities if the investigators turn up empty-handed. &quot;If this turns out to be nothing, the Ministry of Finance is really going to have some explaining to do,&quot; says Shigeyuki Maeda, a law professor at Hosei University.    Even before the Sankyo Seiki case, brokerage firms, banks and insurance companies were trying to show they take seriously the changes in the securities law. Nomura Securities Co., the world's largest brokerage firm, was the first to announce it would erect a &quot;Chinese wall&quot; between its corporate-finance and retail divisions, a major change in Japanese brokerage operations. The Securities Dealers Association and the bank and insurance industry associations have come up with their own guidelines for preventing insider trading.    Nikko Securities Co. has gone so far as to prohibit its executives from trading stocks. But their family members will be allowed to own shares.    Many firms are holding in-house seminars that include lectures on the evils of insider trading. Required reading for many of these sessions is a book called &quot;Insider Trading Restrictions: Questions and Answers.&quot; Nomura has bought 4,500 copies for its employees, primarily salesmen, says Kenichi Takeshita, a general manager at Nomura. &quot;It's not that we haven't trained employees on this before. But given the new environment, we need to give clear information,&quot; he says.    The Finance Ministry is forced to rely on self-regulation in part because it doesn't have the same manpower or authority to prosecute as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. For example, Mr. Matsukawa's 17-person division at the Finance Ministry is charged not only with investigating insider trading and market manipulation, but is also drawing up the new guidelines for futures and options trading.    Nevertheless, Mr. Matsukawa argues that the Japanese system provides effective deterrents. &quot;If they are brought out in the press there's a big social punishment. The criminal level of punishment is low, but the social punishment is high. They will lose their job and their prestige will drop.&quot; (Under the new law, an insider-trading conviction carries a fine of up to 500,000 yen ($3,737) and six months in jail.)    Another problem is the attitude of investigators; finding fault with people goes against the Japanese grain. One market surveillance officer privately confessed that he dislikes looking for abuses because &quot;it only causes more problems.&quot;    What is more, the Japanese legal system, which prefers to settle disputes out of court, isn't prepared for a flood of insider-trading cases, experts say. Prof. Maeda of Hosei University estimates there are only 20 legal scholars in Japan who focus on securities law. At the nation's law schools, there aren't any classes in securities law; the topic is taught in commercial or banking-law courses.    &quot;There are no lawyers who focus only on the Securities Exchange Law,&quot; says Prof. Maeda. &quot;There just haven't been any cases. It would be tough to start a law firm and concentrate on securities law.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
