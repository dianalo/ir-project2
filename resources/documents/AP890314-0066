The underground leaders discounted U.S. criticism of Palestinianguerrillas' attempts to infiltrate Israel from Lebanon and demanded``serious and constructive dialogue'' with the Bush administration.   The leaflet called for two days of general strikes and theboycott of Israeli products, and issued a warning to Arabs workingfor the military government in occupied lands.   ``Consider this leaflet as a last warning to them,'' said theleaflet distributed in Jerusalem and the West Bank. ``If they don'tresign, the strike forces will strike them violently.''   The leaflet praised Israel's Peace Now movement, which hasengaged in a series of public discussions with Palestinians. But itsignaled no flexibility towards lessening confrontations in theoccupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.   ``We will continue and escalate the intefadeh ...,'' it said.Intefadeh is the Arabic term for the uprising.   The statement came a day after Foreign Minister Moshe Arens ofIsrael met in Washington with President Bush and Secretary of StateJames A. Baker III.   To create a climate for negotiations, U.S. officials urged Israeland the PLO to reduce the level of conflict both in Lebanon and inthe occupied territories.   Baker told reporters he was seeking ``various reinforcing andreciprocal steps which might be taken to defuse tension'' in theWest Bank and Gaza Strip.   According to unofficial counts, 396 Palestinians and 17 Israelishave been killed since Palestinians launched their uprising againstIsraeli rule in the territories in December 1987.   Today, four Palestinians _ a 7-year-old boy and three teen-agers_ were shot and wounded by Israeli troops in a stone-throwing clashin the Jabaliya refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, Arab reports said.   The army said it was checking the report.   U.S. officials reportedly urged Israel to take a number ofmeasures such as withdrawing troops from heavily populated areas,releasing some of the 5,000 Palestinian detainees, reopening schoolsand allowing freer travel.   The PLO would be asked to limit violent demonstrations andprovocative leaflets and halt anti-Israeli raids from Lebanon.   Arens told Israel radio today that Baker ``was of the opinion itwas important to reduce tension ... to take steps that could bringthat about. But he didn't elaborate what steps.''   Arens added: ``I said nobody is interested in reducing thistension more than us but how to do it is another question.''   The Hebrew daily newspaper Maariv quoted unnamed sources inJerusalem as saying Israel would continue to bypass the PLO, whichit considers a terrorist organization, and pursue efforts to dealdirectly with Palestinians who live in the occupied territories.   The latest underground leaflet condemned ``Zionist terrorism'' inwhich it alleged Israeli soldiers purposefully killed and woundeddemonstators, demolished homes and arrested thousands ofPalestinians.   It termed the U.S. proposals for lessening tension as ``politicalblackmail'' and said U.S. efforts to label Palestinian guerrillaattacks from Lebanon as terrorism represented ``a one-sidedmanipulation of the media that does not distinguish betweenterrorism and legitimate resistance.''   Maj. Gen. Yossi Peled, commander of the northern zone, said 20Palestinian guerrillas have been killed attempting to infiltrate inthe last month.</TEXT></DOC>
