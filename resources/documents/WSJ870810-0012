WhiteStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 08/10/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> GME GMCOMPUTERS (EDP)DEFENSE DEPARTMENT (DEF) </IN><DATELINE> DETROIT  </DATELINE><TEXT>   General Motors Corp.'s Electronic Data Systems Corp. unit landed a contract from the Navy with a potential value of about $544 million over 12 years.    That amount won't significantly boost EDS's $4.38 billion annual revenue in any single year. But EDS has won several contracts in recent months and is making progress in its quest to gain more business outside GM. Some analysts are betting that the latest contract may ultimately be worth substantially more than the Navy now says.    GM's Class E shares, which represent a dividend interest in the earnings of EDS, jumped $2.75 a share Friday to $46.50 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, on unusually heavy volume of nearly 1.1 million shares. Technology stocks have generally been strong recently.    The Navy said Thursday that EDS had been awarded a one-year, $7.2 million, fixed-price contract to supply computer hardware, software, maintenance and other services for the Navy's Stock Point ADP Replacement (SPAR) project. But the contract includes 11 option years. A Pentagon spokesman confirmed Friday that the Navy intends to exercise that option, and estimated the contract's value in the first 12 years at $544 million.    The spokesman said the contract contains the &quot;opportunity&quot; for an additional 12 years of work, at the Navy's option, making a possible total of 24 years.    The SPAR project involves the modernization and integration of the computerized inventory tracking systems the Navy uses at 58 supply depots around the world.    EDS's chief financial officer, Davis Hamlin, declined to specifically discuss the contract's value, but said he &quot;wouldn't quarrel&quot; with an estimate of $540 million.    The award was more upbeat news for EDS, which has hit a hot streak since weathering the tumult that last December led to the departure of founder H. Ross Perot as the company's chairman. Mr. Perot, who had clashed publicly with GM Chairman Roger B. Smith, accepted GM's offer of $742.8 million for his and some associates' EDS stock, and left his former company and GM's board.    Since last spring, however, EDS has signed several fixed-price contracts to provide services to GM units, resolving a point that had angered Mr. Perot. He wanted fixed-price contracts because they boosted EDS's profit potential, while GM initially had insisted on contracts giving EDS its costs plus a specified profit rate.    The company had at least one major setback recently, when it said in June it would drop out of the running for a $4.5 billion 10-year federal telecommunications contract. Still, second-quarter profit rose 15% to $72 million, or 59 cents a share, from a year earlier. Also, EDS increased the share of total revenue that came from customers other than GM to 32% from 24%.    Analysts said the surge in EDS stock followed word of the contract, but coincided with a broader rally in technology issues. &quot;There definitely seems to be a lot more interest in the technology area,&quot; William Shattuck of Montgomery Securities Inc. said. &quot;I don't think the contract is the only factor affecting the stock.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
