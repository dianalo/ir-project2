The announcement drew immediate and uncharacteristic praise from Texaco's largest shareholder, Carl C. Icahn, who in June lost a bitter proxy fight for membership on the company's board. &quot;I'm very pleased they're doing this,&quot; Mr. Icahn said in an interview. &quot;If they had done it in the first place, there would have been no need for a proxy fight.&quot;    The proposed sale, which could fetch Texaco as much as $3.3 billion, fulfills the second of three major demands that Mr. Icahn has issued to Texaco management. Previously, Texaco agreed to hand over some of the proceeds from its current restructuring effort directly to shareholders, as Mr. Icahn had demanded. As yet unmet is his insistence on an increase in Texaco's 75-cent quarterly dividend to $1 a share.    Texaco's solicitation of offers represents a stark about-face from its position of late last year, when it was emerging from its long, costly legal battle with Pennzoil Co. After agreeing to pay $3 billion to settle that litigation, Texaco launched an aggressive asset-shedding program but said it had no interest in selling any of its most profitable operations, including Texaco Canada.    But Mr. Icahn has been pressing for the sale of Texaco Canada, both publicly and in private discussions with Texaco's top management. And in recent weeks Texaco has hinted that it might be willing to sell the unit.    Yesterday Alfred C. DeCrane, Texaco's chairman, said in an interview that the company had never ruled out the sale -- and that there had never been any &quot;sacred cows&quot; at Texaco. A number of interested parties will be solicited and serious contenders will be identified within six weeks, he said. The sale will be &quot;well along its way by October&quot; and completed &quot;as promptly as possible,&quot; Mr. DeCrane said.    &quot;Clearly the company is up for grabs,&quot; said William Brown III, analyst for Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co.    In fact, some Canadian energy companies have been openly clamoring for Texaco Canada. &quot;They won't have to go very far to find expressions of interest,&quot; quipped Robert Blair, co-chairman of Calgary, Alberta-based Husky Oil Ltd. &quot;We've been standing around on various street corners in White Plains and Manhattan,&quot; waiting to be contacted. (Texaco is based in White Plains, N.Y.) Mr. Blair said that he intended to call Li Ka-Shing, a major Hong Kong investor whose corporate group owns 43% of Husky, to get Husky back into the action.    Husky is just one of at least six parties that have had contact with Texaco or its advisers, several of them in recent days, sources close to Texaco say. An individual familiar with the Texaco Canada sale rattled off four companies -- Husky Oil, Canadian Occidental Petroleum Ltd., Imperial Oil Ltd., and Gulf Canada Resources Ltd. -- that are expected to be contenders in the bidding. &quot;It's going to be a stampede -- their last chance at the biggest marketing company in Canada,&quot; the person said.    Canadian Occidental Petroleum, 48% owned by Occidental Petroleum Co. of Los Angeles, is still considering the acquisition of Texaco Canada. &quot;We're interested,&quot; said Thomas Irwin, vice president for corporate planning of Calgary-based Canadian Occidental. He declined to elaborate on the company's plans.    Gulf Canada Resources, Calgary, didn't entirely close the door on Texaco Canada. Although a company spokesman said Gulf Canada &quot;is not aggressively pursuing Texaco Canada at this time,&quot; he added that Gulf Canada &quot;continues to be interested in expansion in Canada and internationally, through exploration, production and acquisition.&quot;    Canada's largest oil company, Imperial Oil, which is 69.6% owned by Exxon Corp., said that in keeping with longstanding policy it wouldn't comment on whether it was interested in buying Texaco Canada.    Texaco Canada is one of the largest crude oil and natural gas liquids producers in Canada. It also has exploration interests in Brazil and West Africa and about 1,800 retail gasoline outlets in Canada.    Texaco said, however, that it might want to retain some of these foreign exploration ventures. Mr. DeCrane suggested that as part of the negotiation, Texaco intends to carve out these activities and place them in a newly created company, shares of which would be distributed to current holders. The Texaco chairman specifically singled out exploration efforts in the promising Marajo Basin in Brazil, where the company is beginning to drill a second exploratory well, as well as several blocks off the west coast of Africa.    Based on 120.8 million shares outstanding and yesterday's market price, Texaco Canada stock has a market value of about 4.47 billion Canadian dollars (US$3.7 billion). On the Toronto Stock Exchange, Texaco Canada closed yesterday at C$37 Canadian, up C$2.25, on a volume 139,003 shares.    On the American Stock Exchange composite tape, Texaco Canada closed at $30.75, up $1.75. Texaco Inc. shares, meanwhile, closed at $47.625, up 75 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.    A senior Canadian official in Ottawa said the Canadian government would review any proposed sale of Texaco Canada to non-Canadian interests. He said such sales are allowable provided they bring &quot;net benefit&quot; to Canada. The government is expected to insist that the Canadian interest in Texaco Canada remain at least at its current level of 22%.    Peter Bijur, president and chief executive officer of Texaco Canada, said in an interview he was &quot;disappointed&quot; in Texaco's decision. Mr. Bijur, formerly a top aide to Texaco Chief Executive James Kinnear, said that in the past month he has &quot;provided a number of alternatives&quot; to allow Texaco to maintain an interest in the Canadian company.    It is unclear whether Mr. Bijur will leave his post at Texaco Canada and return to the parent.    Once completed, the sale would carry Texaco beyond the $5 billion in asset sales it had pledged as part of its restructuring. The company last month sold Deutsche Texaco AG, its West German unit, for $1.8 billion. And by the end of September, Texaco is expected to complete an $800 million transaction with Saudi Arabia in which the two will jointly operate three Texaco refineries and thousands of retail gasoline stations. The sale of 600 U.S. producing properties, which could yield a profit of more than $300 million, is still being negotiated, Texaco's Mr. DeCrane said.    Texaco has said in the past that it expected to distribute one-third of its asset-sale proceeds to shareholders as either a special dividend or through a share repurchase plan as well as pay down debt.    ---   Alan Bayless in Vancouver and John Urquhart in Ottawa contributed to this article.    ---                      Texaco Canada Inc.
