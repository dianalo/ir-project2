Orders for the mechanical marvels have been on thedecline in recent years after reaching a peak in 1984. One reasonis, robots are still pretty dumb and corporations are hesitant toinvest large amounts of money to develop smarter models.</TEXT><NOTE>By CATHERINE DRESSLER</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Scientists in the 1950s proclaimed the robotthe wave of the future. It would free housewives of drudgery andfill factories with a tireless steel-collar work force. But in manyways, the wave has been a washout.   Robots can paint cars, salvage nuclear fuel and even assist inbrain surgery, but they're still pretty dumb. And they are far fromthe science fiction promise of comic books and movies.   ``Robots now are significantly better than 30 years ago, but thatdoesn't necessarily mean we are anywhere close to an R2-D2 orC-3PO,'' says Raj Reddy, director of The Robotics Institute atCarnegie Mellon University, referring to the robot characters in themovie ``Star Wars.''   Orders for American-made robots have been falling since theirpeak of $501 million in 1984, according to the Robotics IndustriesAssociation.   Experts say automating a factory is more complicated than justbuying a robot and putting it on the assembly line. In addition,they say, some industrial robots are too complicated and prone tofailure and, when they do work, they don't always fit in withfactory operations.   About 33,000 robots work in the United States, mostly inmanufacturing, with automakers buying at least 40 percent, saysrobots association spokesman Jeffrey A. Burnstein.   ``It's not a revolution. It's an evolution,'' Burnstein says.``Robots are another new, productive technology in the same way thatcomputers were.''   Japan is the world's leading robot user, followed by the UnitedStates, West Germany and France.   ``Robots are still dumb,'' Reddy says. ``They're dumb because wehaven't taken the trouble to put the pieces together, not because wedon't know how. That takes money and time and effort, and we don'thave the money.''   But today's robots can:   _See. They don't see like humans, but they can recognize formsand shapes and measure distances through sonar, ranging devices andlasers.   _Hear and speak. They use computers that recognize thousands ofwords.   _Smell. Their sensors can detect smoke or fumes.   _Move. They most often roll on wheels, but some models hop on oneleg and others walk with as many as eight legs, ambling like aspider on uneven terrain.   _Touch. They can recognize texture and the force of a movement,such as pressing.   Many robots have one or two of these abilities to some degree,but creating a competent robot that combines most or all of them hasbeen difficult.   In addition, scientists have found it's difficult to match humanabilities that most people take for granted, such as the dexterityof a finger or the ability to identify objects.   ``The rule of thumb is that if you think the job is easy, thenit's usually difficult,'' says Takeo Kanade, co-director of theCarnegie Mellon institute. ``The list of things that robots can dobetter than humans is much, much shorter than the list of thingsrobots cannot.''   Industrial robots can perform many tedious tasks with precision,including welding, assembling, painting, packaging and loading, yetBurnstein estimates that less than 5 percent of American companieshave installed even one robot.   Japanese companies, which have installed more than twice as manyrobots as American companies, have been more willing to invest inrobots that take years to pay for themselves, Burnstein says.   ``Robots are very expensive to make and they can do verylittle,'' says Hans Moravec, senior research scientist at CarnegieMellon. ``It's hard to find a job for them that actually pays off.''   Moravec says the industrial robot is about as smart as an insect.   ``The robots working on the assembly line today might well becompared to spiders,'' he says. ``They do their jobs competently,but it's a narrow job.''   Industrial robots often shut down when even the slightest thinggoes wrong, forcing humans to their aid, says Donald Michie, chiefscientist of the Turing Institute of Glasgow, Scotland, whichconducts research into artificial intelligence.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
