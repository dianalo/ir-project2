But the margin wasfar short of the two-thirds majority he would need for final passage.;  Wednesday's session was angry and tense.;   &quot;You're insulting us!&quot; legislatorsshouted at one point. A testy Gorbachev shot back, &quot;If you behave like that,it won't make our work any easier.&quot;;   Some suggested that the legislatorsshould accept the inevitable. If they do not approve the decision, Zaslavskysaid, &quot;it is evident that this decision will be taken without us.&quot;;   The plan-- aimed at ensuring an orderly transfer of power from a central governmentgreatly weakened in the wake of last month's hard-line coup -- was put forwardMonday by Gorbachev, Russian federation President Boris Yeltsin and nine otherrepublic leaders.;   Gorbachev told republic delegations to propose amendmentsto a legislative commission before today's session.;   Despite passing animportant procedural test, the fate of the restructuring plan was uncertain.&quot;All right, all right,&quot; said Gorbachev. &quot;The law is still up in the air.&quot;;  The lawmakers voted 1,126-289 Wednesday to approve the resolution &quot;as a basisfor discussion.&quot; But that was short of the 1,500 votes Gorbachev would needfor the constitutional amendments necessary to implement the changes.;   In asecond ballot to transfer the power of the Congress and the central governmentto provisional committees and councils dominated by the republics, the votefailed 1,200-275.;   The count was reduced when some delegates simply left thehall and boycotted the vote.;   The restructuring plan would eliminate theCongress, the country's top legislative body. Gorbachev and his allies triedto sweeten the proposal by guaranteeing that lawmakers would still receivetheir monthly salaries of 300 rubles, or $500, plus free plane and traintickets, according to Algimantas Cekuolis, a Lithuanian observer.;   LawmakerSvyatoslav Fyodorov said most of his colleagues simply did not want to losetheir power and privileges, so the solution was: &quot;The republics can bribethem.&quot;;   The decrees on the Baltics would re-establish diplomatic relationsbetween Moscow and the republics after 50 years of Soviet control. But in aconcession to ethnic Russian minorities within the Baltics, the plan wouldtake effect only after the newly independent nations ratify internationalhuman-rights accords, according to Cekuolis.;   Cekuolis said Gorbachev, whountil recently vehemently opposed independence for the Baltic republics, metwith a delegation of deputies from the three states and said, &quot;OK, you guys,you draft the decree, I will see it and I will sign it.&quot;;   A draft of thedecree explicitly rejects the pact between Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin andNazi dictator Adolf Hitler under which Moscow annexed the three formerlyindependent nations in 1940. &quot;It says we come back like we were before theannexation,&quot; Cekuolis said.;   As the Soviet Union continued to improvise itsway to a drastic recomposition in the wake of a failed hard-line coup and thesubsequent rout of conservative forces, the republic of Moldavia, one of 10Soviet republics to declare independence, asked the Soviet army to withdrawand announced the creation of its own armed forces, Tass reported.;   In otherdevelopments:;   (check) Komsomol, the Communist Youth League that at one timeoversaw the indoctrination of almost all young Soviets, announced that itwould disband. In 1985, before Gorbachev took power, Komsomol boasted 42million members, but in recent years its rolls have shrunk drastically.;  (check) The KGB announced it had given to Sweden all known documents from itsarchives concerning missing Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg, who was seizedin Hungary by the Soviet army in the closing days of World War II after hehelped thousands of Hungarian Jews escape Nazi concentration camps.;   TheSoviet Union has long maintained that Wallenberg died in prison in 1947, butthe West has never been satisfied that the full truth is known.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Washington Post  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Moscow  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910905  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  961  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday, September 5, 199100249135,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENGFRONT  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
