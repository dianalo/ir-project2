The combinationscattering power has been calculated for temperatures 400-600 K, pressures1-3 MPa, with the neodymium laser ({lambda}1.06 {mu}m) as a source andthe possibility of measuring the local temperatures and concentrationof the given gas components with the help of the combination scatteringhas been analysed. It follows from the calculated data that combinationscattering power of N/sub 2/O/sub 4/ reversible 2NO/sub 2/ reversible2NO+O/sub 2/ gas in excitation with the neodymium laser as a source issufficient for detection. Gas temperature is likely to be measured withthe minimum error relative to stokes and anti-stokes bands of the combinationscattering, produced by nitrogen tetroxide. From calculated data it alsofollows that measurement of NO/sub 2/ concentration in the range 400-600K is possible. At the same time combination scattering power, producedby NO and O/sub 2/ components is sufficient for measurement merely withthe concentration of the components of the order of 10/sup 18/ molecules/cm/sup3/ guaranteed in static conditions only at N/sub 2/O/sub 4/ reversible2NO/sub 2/ reversible 2NO+O/sub 2/ gas temperature 500 K and higher.</TEXT></DOC>
