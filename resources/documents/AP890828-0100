The official Islamic Republic News Agency said 22 deputies spokeat Monday's session, the second day of debate on the Cabinet, and atleast eight more were to address the 270-seat Majlis beforeindividual votes Tuesday on the nominees.   Rafsanjani, 55, is known as a pragmatist and seeks renewed tieswith the West to ensure a flow of technology and money needed torebuild the economy after eight years of war with Iraq. He alsowants to encourage private investment.   Velayati, foreign minister since 1981 and a staunch ally ofRafsanjani, is expected to steer Iran more toward the West.   There had been fears the Majlis would reject Velayati becauseRafsanjani failed to comply with a petition from 138 members askingthat he keep his main radical opponent, Interior Minister Ali AkbarMohtashemi, in the Cabinet.   Left off the Cabinet list with Mohtashemi were his two allies,outgoing Prime Minister Hussein Musavi and Intelligence MinisterMohammad Reyshehri. The new constitution made the presidency morepowerful and abolished the post of prime minister.   The news agency said Monday's speakers supported Velayati``because of the backing he had received from the late Imam'' _Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who died June 3, a decade after leadingthe Islamic revolution to power.   Support for Velayati was accompanied by criticism of his ministryfor employing ``Iranian graduates from abroad who lack a combatantand revolutionary record,'' IRNA said.   Mohammad Ali Najafi, a 38-year-old Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology graduate chosen as education minister, appeared to be theleast popular of Rafsanjani's candidates, possibly because of hisWestern background.   IRNA said most of those who spoke Monday urged the rejection ofNajafi, who has been education minister for a year and also held thehigher education portfolio in previous governments.   Public criticism of the education system has increased. Manyofficials believe standards have dropped because of lack of funds toopen new schools and the flight of foreign-educated technocrats andteachers after the revolution.   Rafsanjani had predicted hard-liners in the Majlis would veto hisforeign-educated candidates.   In a speech opening the debate Sunday, the new president said:``Studying at American universities was not and is not a negativepoint. Many (Iranians) who studied abroad have provided valuableservices to this country.''   Abdallah Nouri, the candidate to succeed Mohtashemi as interiorminister, was praised Monday as ``a sharp, witty planner,'' butspeakers criticized Ali Fallahiyan, chosen to replace the radicalReyshehri as intelligence minister, IRNA reported.   It quoted Ibrahim Asgharzadeh, a Tehran member, as sayingFallahiyan, who was Reyshehri's deputy, lacked ``the necessaryplanning ability to take over the job.''   Abdolhussein Vahaji, nominated to move up from deputy commerceminister to the top job, was blamed for many of the ministry'scurrent problems, the agency said.   The department has been without a minister for more than a yearbecause the Majlis has failed to approve at least two previouscandidates.   Deputies said Vahaji displayed ``weak management'' abilities asdeputy commerce minister and expressed ``doubt whether he couldchange things for the better,'' IRNA said.   Rafsanjani was elected president July 28, and given unprecedentedexecutive powers in constitutional reforms approved in a referendumthe same day.</TEXT></DOC>
