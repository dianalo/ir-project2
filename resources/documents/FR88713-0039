Introduction</ITAG>On August 30, 1987, the Silver Fire was started by lightning and burnedthrough approximately 96,500 acres of the Siskiyou National Forest. Inthe aftermath of the Silver Fire, the Forest Service had to decide if itshould leave the burned area to recover naturally, rehabilitate the burnedarea, and/or provide the opportunity to salvage some or all of the burnedtrees.In determining whether to rehabilitate the burned area, additional decisionsincluded how to do so, and which parts of the burned area to rehabilitate.In determining whether to provide the opportunity for salvage, additionaldecisions included how much timber to salvage, where to salvage, and whattype of logging systems to use. In determining whether to implement anyaction in the burned area, decisions included whether roads should be built,and if so, where.Development of mitigation measures and a monitoring plan is also important.Mitigation measures eliminate, avoid or minimize potential impacts of theselected alternative. Monitoring will evaluate the effectiveness of themitigation measures, as well as the effects of project activities and howwell objectives are being met.In order to assist the Forest Service in making this difficult decision,an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) has been prepared. This EIS fullydiscloses the environmental consequences of implementing project optionsavailable to the Forest Service. The Draft Environmental Impact Statement(DEIS) was released March 21, 1988. After a public review period lastinguntil May 9, 1988, a Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) has beenprepared. The FEIS describes and analyzes nine alternatives. The FEIS fullydiscloses information used to decide the type and extent of recovery activitiesfor the area.Approximately 42,900 acres of the burned area are included in the SilverFire Recovery Project. Approximately 53,600 acres are in the KalmiopsisWilderness and will be left to recover through natural processes. The ForestService will not undertake any activities within the Kalmiopsis Wilderness.None of the decisions on salvage or rehabilitation apply to the Wilderness.Land in the Silver Fire Recovery Area is currently managed according todirection in the Rogue-Illinois Land Management Plan (FEIS, 1979). Thatdirection will be superseded upon approval of the Siskiyou National ForestLand and Resource Management Plan (Forest Plan), which was published indraft form in August 1987. Preparation of the Forest Plan was requiredby the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974 (RPA),as amended by the National Forest Management Act of 1976 (NFMA).The NFMA allows the Forest Service to continue the management of unitsof the National Forest System under existing land and resource managementplans pending completion of Forest Plans. This decision on the Silver FireRecovery Project EIS is being made prior to final approval of the ForestPlan. The expected deterioration of the burned timber and its resultantloss in value, as well as the need to accomplish rehabilitation work forsoils, watersheds, and fish and wildlife habitat as quickly as possible,make the Silver Fire Recovery Project decision an urgent one that cannotlogically be delayed until the Forest Plan becomes final. The informationlearned in compiling the Silver Fire Recovery Project EIS will be usedin further development of the Forest Plan and FEIS.An examination of the Rogue-Illinois Land Management Plan and field reconnaissanceconducted after the fire disclosed no inconsistencies between land allocationsin that plan and activities of the selected alternative. These activitiesare based on new data gathered after fire dramatically altered the area.This FEIS, therefore, tiers to the Rogue-Illinois Land Management Plansolely for its land allocations. (Refer to FEIS, Chapter I, Section ``Needand Purpose.'')The FEIS discloses the environmental effects of all alternatives considered.Some environmental effects are probable with the implementation of anyof the action alternatives. These effects are to cultural resources, existingimprovements, wilderness, water, vegetation, fire, air quality, wildlife,visuals, recreation, old growth, and roadless values. (For a more detialeddiscussion of environmental effects of each of the alternatives, see ChapterIV, FEIS.)<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Decision</ITAG>Based on the Silver Fire Recovery FEIS, it is my decision to select AlternativeI-Modified as the project alternative for the Silver Fire Recovery Project.This Record of Decision documents my selection of the alternative and myrationale for the selection.The selected alternative is a modification of the preferred alternative,Alternative I, as described in the DEIS. The interdisciplinary team (IDT)modified Alternative I to better reflect public response to the DEIS andmanagement concerns with the issues of water quality and fisheries, recreation/visuals,economics, timber recovery, and road access.The objectives of Alternative I-Modified is to rehabilitate the burnedarea outside of the Wilderness. The selected alternative will accomplishthis through recovery of burned timber while emphasizing resource protection,especially protection of streams. Project activities are designed to maintainwater temperatures and minimize sedimentation in perennial streams.The selected alternative recovers approximately 157 million board feet(MMBF) of burned timber from approximately 9,500 acres. It constructs approximately20 miles of new roads. Trees will be planted on approximately 5,720 acres,both in harvested units and in unharvested areas.The project area is divided into four transportation areas, based on transportationsystems. Twelve fire salvage timber sales are located within the transportationarea. (For a complete description of Alternative I-Modified, see ChapterII, FEIS.)Where additional tree mortality occurs as a result of the fire, it is myintent to salvage this material. Incidental and insignificant numbers offire-killed trees within units would be removed under the timber sale contracts,if still in force. Since site analysis of these stands has been accomplishedwith the Silver Fire Recovery Project FEIS, the removal of additional mortalitywill be carried out under that document. This material will only be harvestedwhere site conditions, harvest prescriptions, and environmental standardsand mitigations are within the parameters specified in the FEIS.This decision includes a monitoring plan that will provide informationto evaluate project objectives and effects. Information gathered throughmonitoring will also be used to evaluate the appropriateness and timingof future entries into the recovery area. This plan will also provide thebasis for determining the necessity of follow-up rehabilitation measures.The selected alternative complies with all applicable State and Federallaws and regulations. If preliminary data from monitoring indicates thatlaws, regulations, or stated objectives are not being met, the projectwill be modified immediately. Certain measures in the monitoring plan arespecifically designed to provide this feedback during on-going operations.The Silver Fire Recovery Project FEIS is a site specific document. Therecovery project includes twelve salvage timber sales and associated roads.Environmental analysis of these sales is complete with this FEIS.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Rational for the Decision</ITAG>The Forest Service has an obligation to rehabilitate National Forest landsand resources damaged in burned areas outside of designated Wilderness.With full consideration to be given to environmental values, specific managementobjectives for resource recovery and rehabilitation are to:(1) Reforest burned-over areas to ensure watershed and soil quality andto provide for future timber needs.(2) Restore watershed and soil values damaged as a result of the fires.(3) Restore wildlife and fisheries habitat.(4) Salvage as much of the burned timber as possible. Salvage is the removalof recently-dead or dying trees to minimize the loss of wood products.(5) Reduce the potential for insect infestation in adjacent unburned areas.(6) Reduce accumulation of fuel in the burned areas to reduce future firehazard.I am fully aware of the environmental consequences of the alternativesas described in the Silver Fire Recovery Project FEIS. Specific factorswhich weighed heavily in my selection of Alternative I-Modified as a finalrecovery plan are discussed below. No single factor determined my choiceof alternatives. Alternative I-Modified best addresses a combination ofthe issues.One factor is timely salvage of fire-killed timber so the value of thisresource will not be lost to the economy, including local counties andthe federal government. Fire-killed timber can be expected to deterioraterapidly after two years (see Appendix A, FEIS). The selected alternativerecovers about 60 percent of the fire-killed timber in the project area,with all salvage complete in two years. An accelerated implementation schedulemakes this possible. While some alternatives salvage more timber or haveshorter timelines, they do not adequately address other issues such aswater quality. Some road construction is necessary to recover the timberand carry out other rehabilitation work.The selected alternative strikes a reasonable balance between the needto reforest unstocked areas and the high cost of planting trees in areasthat are not easily accessed. Some lands that are unsuitable for timbermanagement will be reforested to benefit soil stability, improve wildlifehabitat, and protect streams from sedimentation. Roads improve the efficiencyof reforestation operations.Equally important is the restoration of the area's capacity to providefisheries habitat and produce steelhead and salmon in Silver and IndigoCreeks and their tributaries. The selected alternative emphasizes streamprotection. Recovery activities have been designed with the objectivesof minimizing physical disturbance of streams and leaving as much forestcanopy cover as possible.Based on our analysis, recovery activities will not cause a measureableincrease in stream temperatures or measureable impact to beneficial usesthrough sedimentation. Best Management Practices (BMPs), measure to protectbeneficial water uses, were described in detail in developing the I-Modifiedalternative. (See Appendix F, FEIS).In selecting Alternative I-Modified, I also considered the issue of wildlife.The selected alternative provides a mid-range of big game habitat and matureand old-growth habitat. The Bald Mountain Road system will be closed tothe public by gate after recovery activities to prevent disturbance ofwildlife, as well as to maintain solitude in certain areas and preventerosion.There will be no adverse impacts to any Federally listed threatened and/orendangered species or critical habitat as a result of this project. Onepair of peregrine falcons was discovered in the project area during fieldreconnaissance, and after publication of the DEIS. The Forest Service,in consultation with the USDI Fish and Wildlife Service, has establishedmeasures to ensure protection of the falcons. These meaures are definedin the completed Peregrine Falcon Kalmiopsis Site Management Plan.Another factor I considered is future site productivity in the projectarea. Productivity of the forest ecosystem is tried to organic matter andnutrient content of soils. (Refer to Chapter IV, section ``Soils,'' FEIS.)The selected alternative includes measures to protect site productivityfrom the potential effects of fire and recovery activities. An averageof at least 20 pieces per acre of large woody material will be left inharvest areas to protect site productivity. The selected alternative fallsin a mid-range of acres harvested. The amount of harvest on higher risksoils was decreased between Alternative I and the selected AlternativeI-Modified. Also, use of helicopter logging systems protects site productivity.The question of the North Kalmiopsis Roadless Area (NKRA) is very importantand frequently raised on the Siskiyou National Forest. I have consideredthe roadless character and controversial history of the entire NKRA byreviewing Appendix C, ``Roadless Areas,'' of the Forest Plan DEIS. Thisappendix analyzes all roadless areas on the Siskiyou National Forest ina site-specific manner, and is incorporated by reference into the SilverFire Recovery Project FEIS. I have also reviewed a summary and analysisof the public responses to both the Forest Plan DEIS and the Silver FireRecovery Project DEIS. I have determined that the need for recovery effortsas described in Alternative I-Modified outweighs the value of maintainingthe entire project area in a roadless state.Ninety-eight percent of the Silver Recovery Project area is included inthe NKRA. The Silver Recovery Project area makes up 38 percent of the NKRA.After the selected alternative is implemented, 83 percent of the NKRA willremain in a roadless state.A primary attribute of the area is its proximity to the Kalmiopsis Wildernessand the Wild and Scenic Illinois River. The area is largely roadless and,for backcountry users, provides solitude and the feeling of remoteness.This special, remote area of the Siskiyou National Forest holds spiritualand cultural values for some of the individuals who commented on the DEIS.Alternative I-Modified allows for preserving some of the areas importantto these individuals.Primitive and semi-primitive recreation opportunities will be reduced,but motorized recreation opportunities will be created. Trail buffers willbe left on the higher use trails. Part of the Silver Peak Trail will bemoved to a ridgetop location. One administrative trail to be used in recoveryactivities has potential as a recreation trail, through connecting theBald Mountain Trail with Hobson Horn Ridge. A trail will be built alongSilver Creek from Old Glory Mine to the confluence of the Illinois Riverfor recreation and rehabilitation work. The west side of Bald Mountainin the lower reach of Silver Creek will remain roadless and largely undisturbed,preserving land allocation options in the Forest planning process.I determined it necessary to find an optimum combination of helicopterlogging and road construction. The helicopter can provide an advantagein speed of salvage, the roads in long-term recovery operations and efficiencyof operations. Helicopters, coupled with long-span Skyline logging systems,are an excellent tool in terms of economic returns and reduced environmentalimpacts. They also allow a lower road density. Helicopters will be usedto recover approximately 105 MMBF, or 67 percent of the burned timber tobe salvaged.Increased access into the project area is necessary for reforestation,watershed rehabilitation work, salvage harvest, and fire fighting. Whileincreased access reduces primitive recreation opportunities and changesthe roadless character of the project area, it allows for development ofnew types of roaded recreation, such as hunting and sightseeing. A portionof the roads constructed in the selected alternative will remain availablefor recreation use. Alternative I-Modified provides a balance between leavingsome roads open for recreation and closing some roads to benefit otherforest uses.Another factor in my decision was the visual quality of the project area.the selected alternative includes several features that are favorable formanagement of the visual resource. The alternative meets the Visual QualityObjectives in the Wild and Scenic Illinois River viewshed, retaining visualqualities of the Illinois River canyon as seen from the river.Current direction in the Rogue-Illinois Land Management Plan classifiesthis viewshed as Management Area 2, with one objective being to ``protectand essentially retain the existing natural qualities, including retentionof visual qualities of the Illinois River Canyon.'' In the draft ForestPlan, this area is allocated as a Custodial (Roadless) area, an area inwhich no timber harvest or road construction activities will occur. Theselected alternative meets all current direction (the Rogue-Illinois LandManagement Plan) and does not preclude future visual management optionsin this sensitive viewshed as described in the draft Forest Plan.The cumulative effects for the visual resource do not meet the objectivesfor visual management in some parts of the project area. However, in areasclassified as Retention, (a very restraining Visual Quality Objective),the selected alternative fully meets this visual objective in all viewsheds.(Refer to Appendix E, FEIS.) This is an improvement on Alternative I, preferredin the DEIS, which would have resulted in cumulative effects exceedingRetention thresholds in two viewsheds. Further measures which will mitigatethe impact on the visual resource include selective cutting, leaving ofwildlife trees, buffering trails, harvesting by helicopter, and grass seedingof the burned areas.Another factor that I considered important is conducting recovery activitiesin an efficient, cost-effective manner. While Alternative I-Modified doesnot have the highest monetary return, it is among the more economicallyfeasible of the alternatives. And, the attributes necessary to protectthe environment are incorporated in its design.The return on the timber is expected to offset the cost of salvage harvest,road construction, and rehabilitation activities. Some harvest units oflow economic return will be made optional for the purchaser. This use ofoptional units makes the selected alternative more economically attractive,and focuses salvage harvest on units of higher value. The selected alternativeprovides a reasonable economic return while meeting the resource objectivesof the project.Alternatives D, H and G have higher present net values (PNVs) than AlternativeI-Modified. The PNV is the sum of all costs and benefits of activitiesin the project area for the next 60 years, discounted back to present time.Alternatives D and G are unacceptable relative to the issues of water qualityand fisheries, recreation and visuals, and wildlife. Alternative H rateslow under the issue of reforestation, and rates lower than AlternativeI-Modified in the important issue of water quality and fisheries. Again,Alternative I-Modified provides a better response to a combination of theissues.Alternative J is the ``environmentally preferrable alternative.'' Environmentallypreferable alternative is defined by Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ)regulations as that causing the least damage to the bilogical and physicalenvironment. Alternative J concentrates on rehabilitation and enhancementof the project area. Alternative J would cause no additional impacts tostreams or fish, and reforestation would occur more quickly in selectedareas than with a fully natural recovery. I did not select AlternativeJ because, while this alternative rates high for some issues such as waterquality and fisheries, it is unacceptable for other issues such as rapidtimber recovery and reforestion. The selected alternative provides a morebeneficial blending of all of the issues.A major on-the-ground effort was made at the beginning of the project toverify existing resource inventories and to determine what changes haveoccurred because of the fire within the Silver Fire Recovery area. Thiseffort involved a variety of resource disciplines. This updated inventoryis the basis of the site specific analysis in the EIS.I intend to use this updated inventory during the completion of the ForestPlan. An overview of this information indicates that a hard look is neededat the preferred alternative in the Forest Plan DEIS, with specific referenceto the lands within the project area. It will be with this in mind thatmanagement of the remaining roadless areas will be addressed in the FEISof the Forest Plan.The cumulative effects analysis established that the fire caused some damageto streams, watersheds, and fish habitat. (Refer to Appendix B, FEIS.)It is my intention to defer future green timber harvest in the projectarea fire perimeter until it has recovered from the combined effects ofthe fire and timber salvage operations. Information collected during monitoringwill be the basis for decisions about future harvesting of green timber.Responses from the public and from other government agencies weighed heavilyin my decision. Opinions were wide-ranging, from ``no action'' to ``salvageas much timber and build as much road as possible.'' We modified the preferredalternative in several areas because of specific resource information andideas from individuals, groups, and other agencies. The overall messagefrom the public was to recover the values of the fire-killed timber, butto do so carefully, with full consideration for both the long-term healthof the forest environment and economic efficiency.Alternative I-Modified does the best job of combining all these factorsinto a plan that makes sense environmentally and economically, and willultimately speed the Silver Fire area to recovery.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Alternatives</ITAG>Following the public scoping of issues, field reconnaissance and data collectionby the IDT, and the study of existing resource inventories, the processof alternative development began.Based on available data and direct public involvement, a full range ofreasonable alternatives for the Silver Fire Recovery Project area was developedand anaylzed in the EIS. Six of the nine alternatives proposed in thisFEIS are the outcome of public workshops in which the public and the ForestService worked together to develop alternatives. Two were developed bythe IDT to provide a range of responses to the issues and concerns. AlternativeI-Modified was developed between the draft and final stages of the EISin response to public comment and management concerns. The nine alternativesare briefly described below. (For a more complete discussion of alternativedevelopment, see FEIS, chapter II, Section ``Alternative Development Process.'')Alternative A_No ActionThe No Action Alternative is required by the National Environmental PolicyAct and serves as a baseline for comparing other alternatives. There wouldbe no road construction, salvage of fire-killed timber, or rehabilitationactivities. The area within the fire perimeter would recover naturally.Alternative DThe objective of Alternative D is to harvest as much fire-killed timberas quickly as possible. More timber would be logged by helicopter thanby skyline cable to eliminate delays created by extensive road construction.Nearly all of the merchantable dead timber would be harvested with littleemphasis on economic efficiences. About 38 miles of new road would be constructedand an estimated 241 million board feet (MMBF) of timber produced.Alternative EAlternative E emphasizes the protection of existing fisheries and waterquality. Fire-killed timber would be harvested in a manner consistent withthis emphasis. No harvest adjacent to streams on land with high potentialfor soil movement would occur. Dead and dying trees in high watershed sensitivityareas would not be harvested. Organic matter would be left and reforestationwould occur on all lands suitable for timber production and some siteswhich are not. About nine miles of new roads would be constructed and anestimated 86 MMBF of timber recovered.Alternative FThe aesthetic and roadless character of the project area and maintenanceand enhancement of wildlife habitat capability are emphasized. Visual QualityObjectives of the area would be maintained by precluding timber harvestin certain visually sensitive areas. Cumulative effects would be very low.All understocked lands suitable for timber production would be reforested.Timber harvest near streams would be restricted to maintain streamsidehabitat. About a half mile of new road would be constructed and an estimated60 MMBF of timber recovered.Alternative GDevelopment of road access for timber management is emphasized. All understockedlands suitable for timber production would be reforested. Unsuitable landswould be replanted where reforestation success is likely. Timber wouldbe logged helicopter during road construction but primarily by skylinecable systems when roads are completed. About 80 miles of new road wouldbe constructed and approximately 212 MMBF of timber recovered.Alternative HEconomic considerations for maximizing net revenues are emphasized. Onlyburned timber stands that produce an economic benefit after subtractingthe costs of harvesting and road construction would be harvested. About22 miles of new road would be constructed and an estimated 130 MMBF oftimber recovered. Alternative I Harvesting timber while emphasizing resource protection is the objective.No timber would be harvested along perennial streams. Moderate amountsof wildlife habitat would be retained on harvested lands. All land suitablefor timber production within two miles of roads would be reforested. TheVisual Quality Objectives would be maintained on land seen from certainvisually sensitive viewpoints. About 21 miles of new road would be constructedand 146 MMBF of timber recovered. Alternative I-Modified (the Selected Alternative)This alternative is based on the same objectives as Alternative I, harvestingtimber while emphasizing resource protection, but with increased emphasison protection of streams. Timber volume recovered will be 157 MMBF andapproximately 20 miles of new road will be built. Alternative JThere would be no road construction and no salvage of fire-killed timber.Resource rehabilitation and enhancement projects would be undertaken andmuch of the area would be reforested.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">(For a more complete discussion of the alternatives, see FEIS, ChapterII.)Other Alternatives ConsideredIn addition to the alternatives listed above, the IDT evaluated other approachesto managing the project area, but did not consider them in detail. AlternativesB and C were used to provide a range of choices to facilitate public participation.They were dropped from detailed study after suggestions from the publicresulted in both being merged with other alternatives. An alternative basedon natural regeneration of the project area and one based on ``naturalselection forest management'' were also proposed, but dropped from detailedstudy. In developing the I-Modified Alternative, the IDT worked with several variationsof Alternative I based on different levels of resource protection and use.These variations are not separate alternatives, but were used as a toolfor evaluating responses to public comments and management concern withthe issues of water quality, recreation/visuals, economics, timber recovery,and road access. <ITAG tagnum="84">V. Issues and Resolution</ITAG>Forest Service scoping of issues included review of the draft Forest Plan,the Rogue-Illinois Land Management Plan, and the environmental documentsand contracts of pertinent timber sales in the area. In addition, the Forest Service actively solicited public opinion in developmentof this project. From the thousands of opinions and comments received,eight issues emerged. The major issues derived during the scoping sessions form the basis forevaluating alternatives for the Silver Fire recovery area. Considerableeffort was expended by both the public and the Forest Service to generatea wide range of alternatives. As a result, the response of each alternativeto each issue will vary from negligible to the maximum possible. This section briefly describes the eight issues and summarizes the effectsof all alternatives on each major issue. (Refer to Chapter I, FEIS formore discussion of the issues. Refer to Chapter II, FEIS for comparisonof the alternatives.) Issue No. I_Rapid Timber Recovery<T3>Issue. </T3> Because of the deterioration of wood and the potentialfor insect and disease damage, the volume and quality of burned timberwill decline rapidly. Depending on tree size, the loss in volume couldrange from 35 to 90 percent of the pre-fire merchantable volume and value.Data show that a majority of loss in volume can be expected to occur withintwo to five years. Figures given depend on the timelines and activitiesof each alternative. <T3>Resolution: </T3>Alternatives G and D provide the largest timber volumerecovery. Of the potential salvage volume of 262 MMBF, 81 percent wouldbe recovered under Alternative G, 92 per cent under Alternative D. AlternativeD recovers more volume than Alternative G because of the greater harvestacreage and early harvesting by helicopter. The additional miles of roadand the time required for construction in Alternative G would allow timberto deteriate, thereby reducing the actual amount of sound salvage volume.Half of the potential volume, 130 MMBF, is harvested under AlternativeH. Alternative I would harvest approximately 6 percent more volume, 146MMBF, on 36 percent more acreage than Alternative H, with the additionalharvest consisting primarily of scattered dead trees. Alternative I-Modifiedwould harvest approximately 8 percent more volume, 157 MMBF, on 21 percentless acreage than Alternative I. Some of the harvest units in AlternativeI have lower volumes per acre than some units that were added to AlternativeI-Modified, allowing for more volume harvested from fewer acres. Harvestingmore trees from a given area under Alternatives H, I, and I-Modified wouldrecover more timber than Alternatives E or F. Alternative F would recoverthe least timber volume, 60 MMBF, of the harvest alternatives because ofthe low number of harvested acres. The ``No-action'' Alternative A and``rehabilitation only'' Alternative J would recover no salvage volume.Deterioration of fire-killed timber would increase markedly during thesecond and successive year after the fire. Wood fiber deterioration overtime would be influenced by factors such as weather, insects, and disease.The predicted deteriorated net volume is the current net volume shown aboveminus the volume of deteriorated wood expected at time of harvest. Issue No. 2_Water Quality and Fisheries<T3>Issue: </T3>Fish are considered the primary beneficial use of streamsin the project area. In the lower Rogue and Illinois River systems, theprimary fish species are Chinook salmon and steelhead. Salmonid habitatis highly sensitive to both natural and human-caused sediment and streamtemperature changes. Sediment entering these streams is expected to increasebecause of the fire. Higher summer temperatures are predicted because ofthe loss of shading due to the fire. Road building and timber salvage couldpotentially increase the fire-caused stresses to fish habitat. <T3>Resolution: </T3>Alternatives D and G would have the greatest effectson water quality and fisheries. Harvest along Class IV drainages, withinareas of high watershed sensitivity, and many miles of road constructionwould generate considerable sediment, result in decreased pool volume instreams. Use of helicopter logging under Alternatives D and G would avoidsome of the adverse effects from cable logging. Alternatives D, G, andH would have identical harvest prescriptions along streamcourses. However,the economic constraints under Alternative H that limit the number of acresharvested would considerably reduce effects on water quality compared tothose of Alternatives D and G. Alternatives A, E, F, and J would retain the most habitat along nonharvestedClass III and IV streams. Increased openings along Class III streams andmore acres harvested under Alternative I would slightly decrease the quantityand quality of stream-related habitat. Alternative I-Modified will retainmore habitat along streams than Alternative I, but less than AlternativesA, E, F, and J. Based on our analysis, Alternative I-Modified will notincrease water temperatures or cause any significant impact on fish. Issue No. 3_Site Productivity<T3>Issue: </T3>Soil erosion, mass wasting, and nutrient cyclying affectproductivity of the forest environment. Organic matter in wood materialcontributes to site productivity. There is concern that site productivitymay be adversely affected by salvage harvest activities. <T3>Resolution: </T3>Alternatives D and G would allow the greatest reductionof total organic matter and therefore could have the greatest effect onsite productivity. Minimum numbers of wildlife trees and pieces of largewoody debris would remain on the area. Organic matter levels would be 35percent of pre-fire levels. Alternative H would result in reduction of total organic matter similarto D and G, but over fewer acres, making its effects less than AlternativesD and G and greater than Alternatives I and I-Modified.Alternatives I and I-Modified would moderately reduce total organic matter,but would leave enough organic matter to ensure maintenence of site productivity.Organic matter levels would be 45 percent of pre-fire levels under bothalternatives. Of the action alternatives, Alternatives E and F would have the least effecton total organic matter and therefore potential site productivity. Largenumbers of trees would be removed in relatively small areas, and lossesof organic matter after fuel treatment (slash burning) would be minimal.Organic matter levels would be 60 and 65 percent of pre-fire levels, respectively.Issue No. 4_Wildlife<T3>Issue: </T3>Wildlife populations within the Silver Fire area have beenaffected to differing degrees by the various fire intensities. There isconcern that the alterations of wildlife habitat produced by the fire maybe compounded by recovery activities.<T3>Resolution: </T3>Alternatives A, F, and J would maintain most of theexisting contiguous mature and old-growth stands which meet the needs ofspecies requiring this habitat. Openings created by the fire have improvedhabitat for big game.Alternatives E, H, I, and I-Modified would moderately reduce the qualityof mature and old-growth stands for wildlife. Big game habitat would bemore suitable than before the fire, due to openings created by the fireand by salvage harvest.Alternatives D and G would considerably reduce the quality of mature andold-growth stands for wildlife because many lightly burned stands wouldbe partially harvested. Big game habitat would be less suitable duringthe first two years of harvest than before the fire because of the milesof new roads and high levels of logging activity on much of the area. Other Effects of the AlternativesAlternatives A, E, F, I, I-Modified, and J would retain many pieces oflarge woody debris for wildlife species that use this habitat. AlternativesD, G, and H would retain very little large woody debris.Forest habitat along streams would not be affected by harvest activitiesunder Alternatives A, E, F, and J. Alternatives D and G would impact alarge amount of this habitat; Alternative H includes the same prescriptions,but over fewer acres for somewhat less impact. Alternatives I would havea moderate impact. Alternative I-Modified will have a low impact on streamsidehabitat. As more acres of streamside areas are affected or harvested, protectivehabitat would be lost, reducing wildlife use in those areas.All alternatives except D and G are expected to retain enough standingdead trees (snags) to provide high quality snag habitat over time. AlternativeD would retain very few dead trees per acre, resulting in a shortage ofsnags as many fall before replacement snags are available.  Issue No. 5_Reforestation<T3>Issue: </T3>NFMA states that all forested lands within the NationalForest System are required to maintain a prescribed level of appropriateforest cover, whether conifers or hardwoods. The objective is to securethe maximum benefits of multiple-use sustained yield management in accordancewith land management plans. There is concern that the burned area may notbe returned to optimum stocking levels because of economic or physicalconstraints.<T3>Resolution: </T3>Alternatives D, E, and G would plant all 7,700 acres``suitable'' for timber production. Alternative F would plant 7,280 acres;the conversion of 490 acres of hardwood stands would be foregone to enhancelong-term wildlife habitat diversity and visual variety. Suitable landsunder Alternatives I, I-Modified, and J that are more than two miles fromthe nearest road would not be planted, unless harvested, because of thehigh costs. Alternative J, unlike Alternative I, would not convert hardwoodstands to conifers. Alternative H restricts planting to harvested suitablelands to minimize costs and generate maximum economic returns. AlternativeA relies solely on natural regeneration of conifers, and an estimated 1,600acres would reforest naturally to conifer-dominated stands.<T3>Issue No. 6_Acres Accessed By Road Development</T3><T3>Issue: </T3>A developed road system provides access for reforestation,control of competing vegetation, fire protection, and wildlife habitatenhancement. Roaded recreation, hunting, fish and wildlife habitat enhancement,woodcutting, and sightseeing are accommodated by roads.<T3>Resolution: </T3>No roads would be constructed in Alternatives A andJ. Access would be limited to the existing road network located on theperiphery of the Silver Fire Area. Alternative F slightly increases theamount of suitable lands accessible by ground-based logging systems, comparedto Alternatives A and J.Alternative E would construct 9.5 miles of new road, increasing to 21 percentthe area within \1/2\ mile of a road. Ten percent of the suitable landswould be accessible by ground-based logging systems.Alternatives H and I would construct 22 and 20.5 miles of new road, respectively.Alternative I-Modified would construct 20 miles of new road. The additionalroad construction in Alternative H does not increase the percentage ofroad access compared to Alternatives I or I-Modified. All three alternativesaccess 30 percent of the area within \1/2\ mile of a road and 15 percentof the suitable lands capable of being logged by ground-based systems.Alternatives D and G would construct 37.7 and 80.2 miles of new road, respectively.Alternative D would provide more general access to the area, particularlyalong the east half of the Silver Peak-Hobson Horn ridgeline. AlternativeG increases road access to nearly three-quarters of the area (nearly themaximum feasible for timber harvest). Increased access over that providedin Alternative D would include construction of a tie-through road fromHobson Horn to Indigo Prairie along Silver Peak ridge, and completion ofroading west across Bald Mountain.Issue No. 7_Recreation and Visual Resources<T3>Issue: </T3>Remoteness and solitude found in the Bald Mountain areaand other portions of the Recovery Project area are highly valued by somepeople. There is concern that increased development would destroy thesequalities and the scenic value of the area.<T3>Resolution:</T3> The Recreation Opportunity Spectrum (ROS) identifiespossible combinations of recreation activity, setting, and experience rangingfrom Primitive to Urban. Alternatives A and J do not change the pre-fireROS inventory; both preserve the existing ROS opportunities. The rehabilitationprojects in Alternative J do not change the ROS.Alternatives D and G would have so many harvest units that the minimumsize criterion for the non-roaded classifications would not be met. Theentire project area would be classified as Roaded Natural. These alternativeswould retain the least amount of acreage classified as non-roaded of allthe action alternatives presented.Alternatives I, E, I-Modified, H, and F would retain increasing amountsof non-roaded acreages, depending on the dispersion of harvest units andthe number of roads proposed for construction. Of the alternatives prescribingtimber harvest, Alternative F would retain the most non-roaded ROS acres,followed by Alternative H down to the minimum in this group with AlternativeI.For visual resources, the alternatives are compared on the basis of thenumber of viewsheds exceeding the ``Maximum Disturbance Thresholds'' forRetention, Partial Retention, and Modification Visual Quality Objectives(VQO). ``Maximum Disturbance Threshold'' is the visual sum of acreage harvestedand roaded, calculated as a percentage for each VQO in each viewshed. The nine alternatives can be grouped into three broad ranges for comparison.Alternatives D and G would create the greatest visual disturbance; sixof the viewsheds would exceed the Retention and Modification threshold;and all nine would exceed the Partial Retention threshold.In the midrange, Alternative E would exceed the Retention threshold intwo viewsheds, and three viewsheds would exceed the Partial Retention andModification thresholds. Under Alternative H, three viewsheds would exceedthe Retention and Modification thresholds, and five would exceed the PartialRetention threshold. Under Alternative I, two viewsheds would exceed theRetention threshold, four would exceed the Partial Retention threshold,and five would exceed the modification threshold. Under Alternative I-Modified,no viewsheds would exceed the Retention threshold, three would exceed thePartial Retention threshold, and five would exceed the Modification threshold.Alternative F has one viewsheds exceeding the Modification threshold, andAlternatives A and J have no viewsheds that exceed a maximum disturbancethreshold.Issue No. 8_Economics <T3>Issue:</T3> The sale of National Forset timber can generate revenuesto the U.S. Treasury and county governments. The monetary return from salvageoperations is affected by the the cost of road construction, the selectionof logging systems (i.e. cable logging, helicopter logging), and the rateof deterioration of the burned timber over time. There is concern aboutwhether timber salvaging and land rehabilitation will benefit the Federal,State, and local economies.<T3>Resolution:</T3> The three separate analyses for the Economic Issueinclude net cash value of the project, payments made to counties, and PresentNet Value. Net cash value of the project is the net balance of all the costs of activitiesand revenues generated from the recovery project. The expected net cashvalue from a salvage operation ranges from $6.3 million in AlternativeH to_$3.9 million in Alternative E. The net cash value of the selectedalternative is $1.7 million. Alternative H would generate the most revenue,even though only 118 MMBF of deteriorated net volume would be salvaged,because timber harvest is limited to stands where revenues exceed costs.Net cash value depends primarily on four factors: The amount of volumerecovered, the mix of logging systems used to recover the volume, the amountof access provided by roads and the amount of rehabilitation scheduledoutside the harvest units. In Alternatives E, F and G, the Federal governmentwould lose money on salvage because timber sale costs are expected to exceedrevenues.The amount of money that the Federal government would share with Oregoncounties from the sale of salvaged timber is estimated to range from $4.6million in Alternative D to $0 in Alternatives A and J. This amount willbe $3.3 million with Alternative I-Modified. These revenues will be offsetby reductions in timber harvesting on the rest of the Forest.Of the nine alternatives, Alternative H is expected to produce the highest($34) payment per thousand board feet (MBF) to the counties because onlythose timber stands that produce an economic benefit would be harvested.With the selected alternative, payments will be $24 per MBF. Under allother alternatives that harvest timber, payments to the counties are expectedto average between $20 and $24 per MBF. The difference in payment amountper MBF would be somewhat offset by the higher harvest volumes producedunder Alternatives D, G, I, and I-Modified.The Present Net Value (PNV) is the sum of all costs and benefits of activitiesin the project area for the next 60 years, discounted back to present time.The PNV would range from around $35 million in Alternatives E, F, and Jto $45 million in Alternative H. The PNV of the selected alternative is$41 million. Most of the PNV is attributed to the estimated net value ofharvesting the 450 MMBF of live, mature timber on lands suitable for timberproduction. Harvesting of green (live) timber was assumed to begin in thenext decade, and continue over the next 40 to 50 years. The differencein PNV between two groups of alternatives (Alternatives D, G, H, I, andI-Modified versus Alternatives E, F, and J) would be the varying net valueof the salvage/rehabilitation project and the amount of roads constructed.The value assigned to future timber management varies among the alternativesprimarily because of the amount of additional future road construction.In alternatives which build roads and salvage timber, the cost of the roadsystem constructed would be partially offset by the value of salvaged timber.Alternative H has the highest PNV because the road construction costs areoffset by profitable salvage harvests.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Public Involvement and Response to Public Comment</ITAG>Because of the history of this area, the Forest Service recognized thatfire in the area would intensify debate about its best and most appropiateuse. A priority of the Silver Fire Recovery Project has been to involvethe public in the decision making process to an unprecedented degree. TheForest Service encouraged public involvement through tours of the firearea; open house informational gathering in Gold Beach, Eugene, Grants,Pass, and Coos Bay; meetings with the forest products industry, enviornmentalgroups, and local, State, and Federal government personnel; and workshopsat which alternatives were constructed by the public. A full page displayad inviting mail-in comments was placed in newspapers in Medford, GrantsPass, Ashland, Gold Beach, and Brookings. Special efforts were made tocontact area industry and environmental groups. Coverage by local televisionand radio stations and newspapers provided additional information sharingopportunities. (For more discussion of public involvement in the projectplanning process, see FEIS, Chapter II, Section ``Alternative DevelopmentProcess.'')The Silver Fire Recovery Project DEIS was released March 21, 1988. Thepublic review period lasted until May 9, 1988. The Siskiyou National Forestreceived almost 28,000 responses to the DEIS. Responses are individualpieces of mail. Each response contained one or more comments dealing withspecific topics.Public response analysis described what the public had said, as completelyand directly as possible. It did not assign any weights or policy recommendations.Decisionmakers need to be aware of all values and opinions expressed. Ananalysis summary report which states whether public opinion generally favors,does not favor, or is divided on an issue is valuable, because it givesan overall view of the public response. However, public response to theDEIS was not a voting process, and the number of ``votes'' alone did notprescribe agency decisions.Responses included original letters and cards, form letters, coupons, petitions,and resolutions. They came from 47 States, the District of Columbia, andthe Virgin Islands. The bulk of replies came from Oregon (22,736), followedby California (1,309), and Washington (916).Form letters and printed post cards made up the majority of responses.A form letter released by Southern Oregon Timber Industries Association(SOTIA), promoting salvage of burned timber, made up the largest groupof a single type of form letter. Form letters in support of a SiskiyouNational Park also made up a large group.Numerous comments requested that the EIS analyze an alternative which includeda National Park containing part or all of the fire area. Some respondentsrequested that the selected alternative not preclude the option of designatinga park in this area in the future. The establishment of a National Parkis a land allocation issue which is outside the scope of this project EIS.The maintenance of present conditions was considered and fully analyzedin Alternatives A and J. The selected alternative does not preclude theestablishment of a park, by Congressional action, on the Siskiyou NationalForest at a future time.Many respondents expressed the conviction that the volume of fire-killedtimber salvaged in this project should be offset by a reduction of greentimber volume harvested on the Forest. Existing resource management plansdo not make a distinction between fire-killed and green timber in calculatingthe maximum amount that can be sold during a period of time. Consequently,the salvage timber will be included in the calculations. The sell volumein Alternative I-Modified is consistent with current resource plans.About 36,000 comments were made about the alternatives described in theDEIS. Each of the alternatives drew some comments. The largest group expressingsupport for a particular alternative favored Alternative J (7,593). Commentsin support of the DEIS preferred alternative, Alternative I, totalled 125;those against totalled 1,259. Comments totalling 19,949 were made in supportof ``Operation Silver Forest,'' a maximum-salvage proposal promoted bySOTIA and included in their form letter.Reforestation was the issue which elicited the largest number of comments(34,918). About 97% of these were on SOTIA form letters and favored plantingand managing the area for timber production.Comments totalling 24,126 addressed the issue of recreation. About 79%of these were on SOTIA form letters and supported development of the area'srecreation potential. About 19% favored maintaining the area's primitivecharacter.The question of salvage harvest drew 22,756 comments. Of these, 15,167were on SOTIA form letters and read, ``Maximize salvage of fire-killedtimber.'' Comments totalling 4,459 voiced disapproval of any salvage offire-killed timber.Comments about the issue of water quality/fisheries totalled 20,484. Concernsranged from a general consideration of the resource to specific concernswith things such as anadromous fisheries and water temperature.A total of 15,121 comments, on SOTIA form letters, indicated support forroad construction in the project area. Reasons given included access forsalvage harvest, future fire protection, and recreation opportunities.A total of 4,680 comments opposed road construction for salvage harvest;a total of 437 opposed road construction for various other reasons.The Oregon State Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) expressed severalconcerns about streams and watersheds. These concerns dealt specificallywith stream sedimentation, the difference between resource impacts causedby the fire and those caused by post-fire recovery activities, stream turbidity,and temperature changes.In developing Alternative I-Modified, the IDT considered the State's comments,as well as concerns expressed by members of the public and Forest Servicemanagement personnel. The IDT consulted both the State and the FederalEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA) on watershed management questions.The EIS was revised to reflect the comments received from the public andother agencies. Changes made between the draft and final stages of theEIS include those discussed below.<T3>Illinois Wild and Scenic River.</T3> Many comments expressed concernabout potential impacts of recovery activities of the Illinois River. Asa result, the FEIS contains expanded discussion about this. Recovery activitieswill not be injurious to beneficial uses, such as recreation or fisheries.<T3>Antidegradation Policy.</T3> The antidegradation policy is part ofEPA regulations for implementing the Clean Water Act. The FEIS includesa discussion of how this policy relates to the project.<T3>Turbidity.</T3> The FEIS addresses turbidity directly as a water qualityparameter and standard separate from sedimentation.<T3>Water Temperature Increases.</T3> Based on our analysis, the selectedalternative will not cause any measurable water temperature increases.The FEIS contains expanded discussion on this question.<T3>Best Management Practices.</T3> BMPs are measures to protect beneficialuses of water. The FEIS includes Appendix F which specifies BMPs for thisproject.<T3>Monitoring.</T3> The FEIS includes Appendix G which describes the monitoringplan that will be used to evaluate effectiveness of mitigation measuresand how well project objectives are met.<T3>Public Participation.</T3> Chapter V, Public Participation, which discussespublic involvement after publication of the DEIS, has been added.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">(For more information on public comments on the DEIS and Forest Serviceresponse to these comments, see FEIS, Chapter V.)<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Mitigation and Monitoring</ITAG>Mitigation MeasuresMitigation measures are defined as actions taken to avoid, minimize, reduce,eliminate, or rectify the impacts of recovery activities. The measuresdescribed in the FEIS, Chapter II are adopted as part of my decision. Allpracticable means to avoid or minimize environmental harm from the selectedalternative have been adopted. Important measures are summarized below.For a more complete overview of the project mitigation measures, see theaccompanying table, ``Summary of Mitigation Effectiveness.''<ITAG tagnum="15">_Streams. Several mitigation measures will be used to minimize physicaldisturbance of streams and to retain as much forest canopy cover as possible.``No cut'' buffer zones varying from approximately 150 to 200 feet willbe left on each side of larger streams (Class I, II, and III). Class IVseasonal streams, which are dry during the summer, will be protected byleaving some trees in and around the stream banks and slopes. Fire downedtrees would be anchored in some larger streams to retain instream logsand maintain existing pool cover. To maintain large woody debris in streams,contract provisions will be used to allow for evaluation of logs in creeksrather than require their removal. Check dams will be constructed acrosssome smaller streams to maintain channel stability and reduce sedimenttransport. Seedlings will be planted in some riparian areas to improvestream shading, bank stability, and erosion control.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Wildlife. Habitat for snag and cavity dependent wildlife will bemanaged according to the current ``Forest Snag (Wildlife Tree) Guidelines.''An average of at least five standing live or dead trees per acre will beleft. In areas that have low amounts of large woody material, an averageof seven trees per acre will be left. All trees will be left within meadowcomplexes. Tree topping or girdling and bird boxes will be used to improvecavity nester habitat. Special wildlife sites will have site specific timbermarking to reduce the impact of timber salvage on wildlife. Selected roadswill be closed after initial activities to prevent disturbance to wildlife.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Supplemental Fisheries/Watershed Areas. These areas extend \1/8\mile on each side of the main stem of Indigo and Silver Creeks. Most ofthese lands maintain mature and old-growth forest characteristics and areimportant for various resource values. There will be no harvest in anyof these areas; however, some areas left in an unstocked condition dueto the fire will be planted.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Site Productivity. An average of at least 20 pieces per acre of largewoody material will be left in harvest areas.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Reforestation. All salvage harvest areas on suitable ground willbe planted. Unstocked lands which are suitable for the production of timberand within two miles of a road will be planted, whether harvested or not.Natural regeneration of conifers is expected to occur in some unplantedareas. Regeneration of hardwood trees and shrubs is expected on most forestedlands within the project area.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Erosion Control. Erosion control measures, such as seeding with grassesand water channeling, will be used to reduce soil movement from road cutand fill slopes and in timber harvest areas where necessary. Rock willbe used on roads to minimize surface erosion during storms and winter haul.Some trees will be contour felled to control erosion in selected areaswhich were intensely burned.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Trails. Roads and trails will be closed when necessary for publicsafety. Trails scheduled to remain open after activities will be protectedwith clauses in the timber sale contracts. Trail maintenance will removehazard trees and rehabilitate fire-related damage.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Visuals. Exterior boundaries of salvage harvest units will be adjustedto create irregular, natural appearing forms. Road cut and fill slopeswill be revegetated to reduce visual contrasts. A ``no-cut'' buffer varyingin width from 100 to 300 feet will be left adjacent to the Hobson Horn-SilverPeak Trail and a 300 foot wide buffer will be left adjacent to the IllinoisRiver Trail to minimize impacts to visual quality. Slash will be hand piledwithin 100 feet of the Hardscrabble and Lazy Creek Trails.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Port-Orford Cedar Root Disease (</ITAG><T3>Phytophthora lateralis</T3>). The objective is to prevent the importof the disease into uninfected areas containing Port-Orford cedar. Dueto the accelerated schedule of this project, log trucks will be haulingoutside of the normal operating season, during wet weather. At these times,log trucks and other equipment using Road 2512 will be washed to preventspores from being transported when moving into uninfected areas containingPort-Orford cedar. In one stand along Road 2600.065, Port-Orford cedarwill be removed from areas adjacent to the road to reduce the chance ofintroducing the disease.<T3>Standard Contract Provisions. </T3>Standard provisions will be usedin timber sale and road construction contracts to protect mining claimimprovements; important cultural resources; threatened, endangered, andsensitive plant and wildlife species; and survey monuments and corner locations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">(For a more complete discussion of mitigation measures, see FEIS,Chapter II, Chapter IV.)<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 3410-11-M002</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 140-141</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 3410-11-C</ITAG>Monitoring PlanMonitoring is the evaluation of project implementation to determine howwell objectives are being met, as well as determine the effects of projectimplementation on the environment. The Forest Service will monitor thisproject during and after its implementation to ensure that objectives arebeing met and to gather research data. Information gathered in the monitoringplan will also be used to gauge appropriateness and timing of any futureentires and necessity of follow-up rehabilitation measures. Monitoringmethods include surveillance, sampling, and measurement.If preliminary data from monitoring indicates that laws, regulations, orstated objectives are not being met, the project will be modified immediately.Certain measures in the monitoring plan are specifically designed to providethis feedback during on-going operations.The monitoring plan addresses five basic topics:Implementation: Was the project completed according to plans?Effectiveness: Did the mitigation measures accomplish what was expected?Validation: Were assumptions about resource effects accurate?Research: Is there something special about this project that could addto our general knowledge?Inventory: Is there an opportunity to expand or update our resource database?Following is a summary of the monitoring and research plan. (For a morecomplete discussion of the monitoring plan, see FEIS, Appendix G.)Rapid Timber RecoveryInventory timber in fire areas to gather data on deterioration and fellingbreakage in fire-killed timber. Inventory break beetle damage in fire areasto gather data on post-fire insect mortality. Water Quality and Fisheries Measure changes in stream temperatures, flow and turbidity. Examine streamchannels for structural changes. Determine changes in fish populationsand habitat. Check width of stream buffers and evaluate their effectiveness.Measure changes in landslide rates. Check landing, road building, and loggingpractices to ensure that streams are protected as described in prescriptions.Site Productivity Evaluate changes in vegetation, soil, and woody material in burned areasboth with and without recovery activities. Gather information to use inmanaging the burned ecosystem and determine whether we have maintainedsite productivity in harvest units. WildlifeEvaluate occupancy and suitability of designated old-growth habitat areasto ensure that they are adequate. Verify that prescriptions were followedin leaving special wildlife site buffers and wildlife trees. Monitor peregrine falcon pair in area to ensure they are not disturbedby harvest activity. ReforestationPre-planting stand exams are in progress. Post-salvage planting will beginin spring of 1989. Establish new stands within five years of harvest. Recreation and Visuals Evaluate changes in viewsheds over time. Verify that trail buffer prescriptionswere followed. Evaluate whether or not the prescriptions met objectives.<ITAG tagnum="84">VIII. Implementation </ITAG>The project is divided into four transportation areas, based on transportationsystems, and includes twelve separate timber sales. Specific locationsand details are available in the sale implementation records at the Galiceand Gold Beach Ranger Districts and at the Siskiyou National Forest Supervisor'sOffice. Some salvage harvest units, totaling approximately 3000 acres, are beingoffered as optional units. These are units of low economic return. Allwould be helicopter yarded and generally have long flight distances andlow volumes. They can be included in harest activities by agreement withthe Forest Service if the sale purchaser so wishes. The optional unitswould be paid for at current contract rates and would be subject to thesame contract provisions as other units. The analysis of all environmental effects includes the effects of harvestingthese optional units. Two economic analysis were completed, one with theoptional units, and one without. The estimated total volume of all salesis 157 MMBF with the optional units and 145 MMBF without. Estimated acresand volume to be harvested are listed in the accompanying table. All figureshave been rounded and are approximate. The Forest Service has continued survey, design, and field layout workon the Silver Fire Recovery Project while making the choice of a selectedalternative. No permanent, on-the-ground changes were made during thisperiod. Most of the work consisted of such tasks as flagging boundariesand surveying road locations. This work was done with the full knowledge that some or all of it mightnot be used. Due to the urgency of recovery operations, it was not feasibleto interrupt field work until selection of the alternative documented inthis Record of Decision was made. As actual field layout of salvage sales progressed, there was some additionalrefinement of resource data. Layout of some units and roads was adjustedwhere needed, in order to reduce the environmental effects of activities.Although there may be slight discrepancies between actual unit boundariesand the selected alternative maps, all of the actual layout on the groundis within the area for which site specific analysis was done in the FEIS.The extension of the Bald Mountain Road is essential to this project. Thisextension provides access to portions of the Chinaman Hat and North Silvertransportation areas, in addition to the Bald Mountain transportation area,for rehabilitation and salvage harvest. In the selected alternative, severalroads feed into the Bald Mountain Road. Only a portion of the Bald MountainRoad itself is part of an individual salvage sale. Completion of this roadis critical if Alternative I-Modified is to be implemented as planned.For these reasons, a public works contract will be awarded for constructionof this road. All other roads will be built as part of individual timbersale contracts.The public works contract has already been advertised in trade journals,and bids will opened June 26, 1988. The Forest Service expected to awardthe contract by July 11, 1988. Due to the urgency of completing this road,preparation of contract documents was begun before the final selectionof an alternative. Again, this was with the full knowledge that some orall of the contracts preparation work might not be used. The Forest Service expects construction to begin in the Bald Mountain Roadin July, 1988. The required completion date is October, 1988. Due to the urgency of the Silver Fire Recovey Project, implementation willbegin in July, 1988 and continue as follows:<ITAG tagnum="15">Auction for public works contract: June, 1988</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Award of public works contract: Estimated July, 1988</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Start Bald Mountain Road construction: Estimated July, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Auction of the 12 timber sales included in the project: July 11, 12,13, 14; 1988</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Timber sale contract award: Estimated August, 1988</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Start timber sale road construction: Estimated August, 1988</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Begin cutting of timber: Estimated August, 1988</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Finish all project road construction: By October, 1988</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Finish hauling logs: By December, 1989</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Planting: Spring, 1988 through spring, 1991.</ITAG>Some planting was done in spring of 1988 within the burn.
