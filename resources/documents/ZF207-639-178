With the Clustor, they'regetting the same performance for a lot less money.andP;  Obviously that's notsomething that DEC wants people to do, because then it won't sell as many VAX6000s.andM;FEGREUS: Is SI considering enhancing itsproducts through software offerings?andM;EMERY: Absolutely.andP;  One thing my recent sabbatical of nine months with theSanta Cruz Operation taught me is that there are an infinite number of waysto enhance systems through software.andP;  We are looking aggressively atsoftware.andP;  That's the way the world is going.andM;My top priorities in this area would be networking, security and datamanagement.andM;FEGREUS: How about Unix?andP;  WIll we be seeing SI products supporting NFS andthe new Ultrix-based DECsystems and DECstations?andM;EMERY: We're taking a very hard look at that.andP;  I believe the Unix area hassignificant potential.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
