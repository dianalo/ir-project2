In these elections, the Republicancandidates offered something unique in the annals ofpolitical history: a reformist conservatism. Not elitist,pessimistic and crabbed, but open, optimistic and populist.   In 1980, Ronald Reagan grabbed the flag of progress. Thestagflation of the 1970s could be curbed by sound money andincentive tax cuts. If the West found the will to defenditself, communism could be not only contained but defeated.The Republicans became the party of ideas, with think-tankproposals to improve society by lifting the dead hand ofWashington. When President Reagan passed the torch to GeorgeBush at the 1988 Republican convention, he could say: &quot;Andnow we hear talk that it's time for a change. Well, ladiesand gentlemen, another friendly reminder: We are the change.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   As George Bush announced his re-election campaignyesterday, these heady airs have dissipated like ozone. Mr.Bush could use the reformist formula (&quot;read my lips&quot;) topummel hapless Michael Dukakis on the stump, but in officethe Beltway's insidious fluorocarbons went to work. With agradual decomposition throughout the atmosphere and thegigantic Antarctic hole of the 1990 budget agreement, thereform chemistry has collapsed. President Bush offerscompetence and experience. But an agent of change heemphatically is not.   ---   So Republican politics have reverted to form, withdifferent factions of the party finding their historic roots.Indeed, connoisseurs of political history will have notrouble identifying Mr. Bush and his inner circle asMugwumps. The heart of Mugwumpery was distrust of the brutishinstincts of the common voter, an urge for government by &quot;thebest men.&quot;   In particular, the Mugwumps broke with the RepublicanParty over its 1884 nomination of James G. Blaine, a machinepolitician of the old order. They swung instead to DemocratGrover Cleveland, despite his admitted sexual peccadilloes(&quot;Ma] Ma] Where's my pa? Gone to the White House, Ha] Ha]Ha]). The Mugwump spirit gave us the secret ballot and theblessing and curse of civil service reform. And whileTheodore Roosevelt disdained the amateurism of intellectualmugwumps, his progressive Republicanism borrowed themes suchas conservation and high-minded regulation by, say, theInterstate Commerce Commission.   The echoes appear in George Bush's Clean Air Act orwetlands regulation, and most of all in the distinction hedraws between campaigning and governing. On the campaignstump, Willie Horton is fair game. But governing consists ofreaching a consensus among &quot;the best men,&quot; which of coursethe son of a U.S. senator understands to include club membersof the other party. In New Hampshire, challenger Pat Buchanandraws his best applause with a line alluding to thepresident's deadline for tax action from Congress, sayingPresident Reagan didn't wait to March 20 of his fourth yearin office to start fighting for his ideas.   If the president echoes the Mugwumps, though, Mr. Buchananechoes the Know-Nothings. He's skillful enough as apolitician to tone down his protectionist appeals when theyfall flat with voters. And the issue of past anti-Semiticremarks faded once he was properly chastised by William F.Buckley. Still, the distinctive force behind his candidacy isthe strain of nativism that runs as a counterpoint to thenation's great immigrant tradition.   It is ironic but scarcely surprising that the Know-Nothingmovement that peaked in 1854 mobilized against disruptiveimmigrants from Mr. Buchanan's own ethnic group, IrishCatholics. Its American Party declared a platform of&quot;Anti-Romanism, Anti-Bedinism {?}, Anti-Pope's Toeism,Anti-Nunneryism, Anti-Winking Virginism, Anti-Jesuitism andAnti-the-Whole-Sacerdotal-Hierarchism with all its humbuggingmummeries.&quot; Before being swept away by the bigger issue ofslavery, Know-Nothings took the Massachusetts legislature andelected some 75 members of Congress.   Abraham Lincoln, casting about for a political party,declared he was not a Know-Nothing. In practice, he noted,the nation read the Declaration of Independence as saying&quot;all men are created equal, except Negroes,&quot; and that theKnow-Nothings would make it &quot;. . . except Negroes andforeigners and Catholics.&quot; He said he'd prefer a country likeRussia, &quot;where they make no pretense of loving liberty.&quot;   ---   So in 1992 Republicans find themselves choosing betweenscrubbed-up versions of two hoary factions. Those upset aboutthe loss of the activist conservatism of four years ago arenaturally tempted toward a protest vote to send PresidentBush a message. Yet Mr. Buchanan is a dangerous messenger,above all for those who see international integration as ahistoric force both healthy and too strong to thwart. Hecould once again encumber the word &quot;conservative&quot; with thenarrow-minded and inward-looking overtones from which RonaldReagan rescued it.   Mugwumps are a more familiar force, and probably lessinimical to a rebirth of reformist conservatism. Yet howwould they read a &quot;message&quot;? The voters might want to bringback &quot;read my lips&quot; and have the president get a new team tonegotiate budget deals. But given the Bush administrationreaction to the health-care issue in Pennsylvania's Senaterace, in a campaign mode it might instead decide the messagein a Buchanan vote was to junk the Mexican free tradenegotiations.   A reformist conservative might find some solace in aborn-again Paul Tsongas on the Democratic side of the ticket,but it's a shame that the Republicans have lost theirrecently found reformist edge. Just when the electorate soclearly wants a formula for change, the Mugwumps andKnow-Nothings offer a sorry choice.   ---   Mr. Bartley is editor of the Journal.</TEXT></DOC>
