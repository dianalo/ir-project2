In a paper published in this week's edition of the British journal Nature, Sukanto Sinha and co-workers at the biotechnology concern said they have found the identity of a key protein associated with Alzheimer's disease.    The protein, called beta-amyloid precursor protein, gives rise to the abnormal amyloid plaques previously reported to be deposited in the brains of Alzheimer's patients. The numbers of such plaques are linked with the disease's progressive dementia, though it isn't yet known whether the plaques are the cause of the disease or just one of its manifestations, Athena said.    The protein reported on by the Athena team is also thought to be a precursor of another previously described protein called protease nexin II, one of a family of agents that control certain enzymes and interact with cells.    The company said it is working with Eli Lilly andamp; Co. to develop therapeutic products for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. </TEXT></DOC>
