Robinson III, the company's chairman andchief executive officer, up to something they would be wiseto steer clear of?   Harry L. Freeman was given to flashes of both brillianceand bad judgment, but Mr. Robinson's reliance on him wasunquestioned. The two frequently began their day at 6:45 a.m.over a pot of coffee in the chairman's corner office. Specialprojects were Mr. Freeman's bailiwick, and associates saythat didn't please the company's top lawyers, Gary A. Bellerand Lawrence Ricciardi, who fretted that one of Mr. Freeman'soperations might one day blow up in their faces. &quot;We've gotto stop this guy,&quot; Mr. Ricciardi said on more than oneoccasion. &quot;He's going to destroy us.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Few knew quite what Mr. Freeman was up to this time, butit was clear he had targeted one of the company's thorniestcompetitors, the international banker Edmond Safra, a man whosome American Express officials were obsessed with defeating.   When Matthew Stover, then an American Express publicrelations executive, asked about the project, he says, &quot;I wasalways told, `You don't want to know.'&quot; Finally, in thesummer of 1988, Mr. Ricciardi, the lawyer, confronted Mr.Freeman. &quot;Harry, I don't know what you're up to,&quot; he said.&quot;But if I were you, I'd stop what you're doing immediately.&quot;   The warning was apt, but it was too late. In a stunningdisclosure, American Express admitted last year that it hadengaged in a covert campaign to ruin Mr. Safra's reputationby spreading rumors and articles in the international press.The company made a painful, public apology for what itschairman, Mr. Robinson, called an &quot;unauthorized and shamefuleffort,&quot; and paid $8 million to Mr. Safra and charities heselected. As part of the agreement, details of this &quot;shamefuleffort&quot; were to remain secret.   Afterward Mr. Freeman announced his retirement, saying hehad done nothing wrong, but taking responsibility for theaffair because it had happened &quot;on my watch.&quot; Companyofficials privately blamed the incident on a handful ofunnamed low-level employees. Other top officials to this dayinsist, as one puts it, &quot;no one did anything he believed waswrong or beyond his authority.&quot;   But a lengthy investigation by this newspaper revealsevidence suggesting the effort to smear Mr. Safra was in factoverseen from Mr. Freeman's office, only steps away from Mr.Robinson's.   Mr. Freeman supervised and approved the hiring of the twoAmerican Express operatives who carried out the Safracampaign: One a private detective, the other a publicrelations executive who frequently worked directly for Mr.Robinson as an aide. For at least two years, the operativesinvestigated Mr. Safra and then spread rumors and newsarticles containing patently bogus information about him. Thearticles linked Mr. Safra to drug trafficking, moneylaundering and murder, and to criminal elements ranging fromColombia's Medellin drug cartel to the late Mafia figureMeyer Lansky. Mr. Freeman met often with one of theoperatives, and approved expense vouchers for the other.   For American Express, a company that has enjoyed avirtually unrivaled reputation for integrity, the Safraaffair reveals a willingness to engage in unseemly corporaterevenge when confronting a rival, and, at the very least ajarring lack of oversight on the part of top companyofficials.   Despite regular contact with one of Mr. Freeman'soperatives, there is no concrete evidence that Mr. Robinsonknew of the smear campaign against Mr. Safra. Indeed, he andother top American Express officials, including Mr. Freeman,have vehemently denied any prior knowledge of the anti-Safraeffort. Instead, they argue that a legitimate investigationof a competitor's activities was simply taken too far byoverzealous employees.   The Safra affair is a story of corporate intrigue playedout on three continents. Suspecting that American Express wasbehind the outbreak of specious stories that began surfacingin early 1988, Mr. Safra hired numerous detectives whoengaged the American Express operatives in a cloak-and-daggerpas de deux that resulted in proof of the company'sculpability roughly a year later.   In response to repeated inquiries, American Expressyesterday issued a statement denying that any of itsemployees knowingly spread false information. The company hassteadfastly declined to discuss details of the matter.Instead, it turned to Arthur Liman, the noted New Yorkattorney, who in two phone calls over the past two monthssaid he would urge the company to sue this newspaper if itpublished defamatory statements about the anti-Safracampaign, suggesting that &quot;this is a textbook case of whatlibel is about.&quot; Mr. Liman emphasized that to comment furtherwould violate &quot;the moral spirit&quot; of the settlement with Mr.Safra. In early August, Mr. Robinson telephoned Mr. Safra andsaid he had &quot;personally told my people,&quot; including Mr.Freeman, not to talk to this newspaper.   Last week, an attorney representing Mr. Freeman, JohnWalsh, wrote this newspaper to say that this article would be&quot;actionable&quot; if it contained any statements implying that Mr.Freeman had engaged in or covered up &quot;any campaign ofdisinformation&quot; against Mr. Safra.   This article was pieced together from interviews withdozens of people involved in the Safra affair, includingAmerican and European journalists, private detectives andmore than 15 current and former American Express executives.Among the few executives willing to comment on the record wasRobert F. Smith, former chairman of American Express Bank,who left the company under a cloud last year.                                                                                                          From Rivalry to Obsession:   A Merger Gone Bad                                                                                                          The feud between American Express and Mr. Safra developedsoon after Mr. Robinson's decision in 1983 to buy for $550million Mr. Safra's Geneva-based Trade Development Bank,known as TDB, one of the crown jewels of the rarefied worldof Swiss banking. Mr. Safra, born in Beirut and descendedfrom a long line of Syrian traders and bankers, had foundedTDB's predecessor bank in 1956, after having founded hisfirst bank in Brazil. In the 1960s Mr. Safra started a U.S.bank, Republic National Bank of New York, and the firms' risemade him one of the world's most influential bankers.   The union of American Express's international banking arm,American Express Bank, and TDB was doomed from the beginning,largely because of Mr. Safra's inability to function withinthe rigid framework of a multinational conglomerate.Associates say Mr. Safra might have stepped out of an18th-century portrait, a formal, secretive billionaire whoseSwiss bank offered unmatched personal service to its wealthyMiddle Eastern and Latin American clients. Befitting hisimage, Mr. Safra lives in a castle-like villa, La Leopolda,the King of Belgium's former estate on the French Riviera.   In image and experience, Mr. Safra's new boss, JimRobinson, could hardly have been more different. Mr.Robinson, a Harvard MBA and the son of a legendary Atlantabanker has in his 13-year reign generated generally strongfinancial results and reaped publicity so relentlesslyfavorable that, until this year's near-collapse of thecompany's Shearson Lehman Hutton unit, he was sometimes knownas &quot;The Teflon Executive.&quot; The formal, unfailingly polite Mr.Robinson speaks again and again of the importance of qualityand integrity.   Mr. Robinson's image has had a paradoxical quality thathas become more pronounced in recent years. Although he isportrayed as a hands on manager who pores relentlessly overbriefing papers and knows the names of low-level employees atcompany field offices, he is also depicted as an executivewho gives subordinates a great deal of leeway, a fact thathas often forced -- or enabled -- him to plead ignorance whenplans go awry.   Mr. Robinson's efforts to bring Mr. Safra and TDB into the21st century failed miserably. Mr. Safra abhorred memos;American Express demanded them. Mr. Safra emphasizedlongstanding relationships; American Express wanted moreloans and higher margins. Mr. Safra deplored publicity;American Express thrived on it. American Express executivesthought Mr. Safra high-handed and imperial; Mr. Safra feltexcluded from Mr. Robinson's inner circle.   After less than two years, the two men parted ways. InDecember 1984 Mr. Safra resigned as chairman of theTDB-American Express Bank combination, but agreed not tofound a new Swiss bank until March 1988. Mr. Robinson,anxious to make the split appear amicable, gave him the meansto do so, selling Mr. Safra some minor operations in Parisand London and, more importantly, TDB's Geneva headquarters,the symbol of Mr. Safra's Swiss power.   Simmering resentment burst into open hostility during Mr.Safra's severance negotiations, when the two sides couldn'tagree on a price for the Geneva headquarters. Matters grewworse in the months following Mr. Safra's departure, whenofficials at American Express Bank suspected that Mr. Safrawas hiring away employees with an eye to his 1988 re-entryinto Swiss banking. Incensed, Bob Smith, the banker whosucceeded Mr. Safra as chairman, launched a full-scaleinvestigation, even hiring detectives to follow the employeesin question. &quot;I told Jim {Robinson} what we were doing,&quot; Mr.Smith says today. &quot;I told him it was necessary to keep itsecret.&quot;   Fear of Mr. Safra mounted as Mr. Smith constantly warnedMr. Robinson of the threat posed by Mr. Safra's loomingreturn to Swiss banking. Inside American Express, the feelingspread that any effort by Mr. Safra to reclaim his formercustomers could be a death blow to the weakened bank.   Their worries were fanned by Mr. Smith's inability totrust his own executives, many of whom had worked for Mr.Safra, and by the bank's status as a poor-performing orphanwithin the American Express empire. Headquarters had tried tosell the bank in 1981; Mr. Smith and his aides also exploreda leveraged-buy-out.   Mr. Smith, by his own admission, had become obsessed withstopping Mr. Safra. His aides began looking for anything thatmight harm Mr. Safra, investigating whether the banker mightbe using his corporate jet for personal trips -- althoughthere is no evidence he did so -- and probing his U.S. taxsituation for weaknesses -- although the IRS has neverbrought an action against Mr. Safra. &quot;I said, `If the son ofa bitch competes with us, we'll turn him in to the IRS,'&quot; Mr.Smith recalls. When Mr. Safra learned of these efforts, heprotested to Mr. Robinson on a number of occasions between1985 and 1987. With regard to such protests, Mr. Smithrecalls telling aides, &quot;Screw {Safra}, we've done nothingwrong.&quot;   Mr. Smith's anger spread to other American Expressexecutives. In early 1987 American Express finally took legalaction, filing a criminal complaint against Mr. Safra inGeneva for unfair competition, mentioning the stolenemployees -- the banker's companies had hired as many as 23American Express Bank employees -- and a key computer tapethat turned up missing. When Mr. Safra applied for hisbanking license that May, American Express lawyers filedpapers to block it.   Months ticked away. Then, in January 1988 Swissauthorities approved the licensing of Mr. Safra's new bank,rejecting the American Express brief out of hand. The fightshould have ended there, and to outward appearances it had:American Express declined to appeal, allowed its criminalcomplaint to lapse, and Mr. Robinson called and graciouslycongratulated Mr. Safra. In fact, it was only the beginning.                                                                                                          A Matter of Honor:   The Hunter Is Hunted                                                                                                          The summer of 1988 began joyously for Edmond Safra. InMarch, he opened his new bank at the site of his old one, 2Place du Lac in Geneva, the city's pre-eminent bankingaddress. In August, he invited thousands of guests, includingPrince Rainier and Princess Caroline of Monaco, to hisbirthday party at La Leopolda.   The celebratory mood ended two weeks later, when Mr. Safrawas shown a curious article in La Depeche du Midi, a Frenchnewspaper based in Toulouse. A jumble of fact and fiction,the story linked Mr. Safra to the Mafia, South American drugtraffickers, the CIA and the Iran-Contra scandal. To Mr.Safra's surprise, it also referred to similar stories inPeruvian and Mexican publications, and to a previous articlein La Depeche that March linking Mr. Safra to drugmoney-laundering.   Mr. Safra's alarm grew when the other articles crossed hisdesk. A Lima-based newspaper named Hoy had run a full-pagearticle July 4 profiling Mr. Safra and his banks as the pawnsof drug traffickers and tying him again to New Yorkgangsters, the CIA and the Iran-Contra affair. &quot;Mafiosobankers turn their eyes to the south,&quot; the headline read.Five days later, a left-wing Mexico City paper named Uno MasUno had reprinted much of the Hoy story.   The articles posed a potentially devastating attack on Mr.Safra's reputation for honesty and discretion. But they alsothrust at the dark underside of Swiss banking -- the factthat its vaunted secrecy laws attract money from criminalenterprises of all stripes to its institutions, including,from time to time, Mr. Safra's. Too many people, his aidescould see, might believe the stories.   As Mr. Safra's aides studied what to do, a bombshell hit.In Paris, an extreme right-wing, anti-Semitic newspaper namedMinute published on Aug. 31, 1988, an article charging thatMr. Safra was actively involved with cocaine traffickers andthe Mafia. &quot;Billionaire of the White Stuff,&quot; the headlineread.   Horrified, Mr. Safra summoned his top aides to La Leopoldato discuss what to do. The articles had a number of commonelements, and the assembled executives agreed on one thing:If the articles represented an organized campaign, onlyAmerican Express had the world-wide resources -- and themotive -- to carry it off. &quot;But you know,&quot; Walter Weiner,Republic Bank's chairman, said at one point, &quot;we'll never beable to prove that.&quot;   In the meantime, Mr. Safra sued Minute, but only after thepaper published four more lurid articles that fall, allegingMr. Safra's ties to Manuel Noriega, the Medellin cartel andMeyer Lansky. Then, when proceedings in the libel suits beganlater that fall, one of Mr. Safra's French lawyers made astartling discovery. Near the top of a 1967 Life magazinearticle on the Mafia, which never mentioned Mr. Safra butwhich Minute had produced to defend information in one of itsarticles, a fax &quot;telltale&quot; could clearly be seen: &quot;FEB 25 '8821:26 AMEX CORP COMM NYC.&quot; The article had been transmittedby a fax machine at American Express's New York corporatecommunications department.   The Safra camp's jubilance over the discovery was temperedwhen they realized that the &quot;telltale&quot; was far fromconclusive. Among the few other pieces of evidence they hadwas a name: Tony Greco. It had come thirdhand, from theboyfriend of a Minute clerk. When Mr. Weiner, Republic Bank'schief, hired a detective to look into Mr. Greco, he foundnothing.   Then, in February 1989, as the Safra forces pondered theirnext move, they got a break. The Miami office of RepublicBank of New York received a call from a Peruvian named VictorTirado, who claimed to have information about an organizedsmear campaign against Mr. Safra. The call was forwarded toRepublic's general counsel, Ernest Ginsberg, who then calledMr. Weiner and exulted: &quot;I just got a call and I can'tbelieve my ears]&quot;   A Safra detective traveled to Washington to meet Mr.Tirado, who, to the Safra team's surprise, turned out to bedeputy press attache at the Peruvian embassy and a formerpress secretary to the then-president of Peru, Alan Garcia.The rotund Mr. Tirado told the detective that a friend namedAntonio Greco was behind stories about Mr. Safra in Peru, andprobably in Europe as well.   Mr. Tirado's second contention was even more provocative:&quot;Greco claims he's working directly with Jim Robinson.&quot; Whilethat assertion was never proven, it gave the Safra forcesadded incentive to probe Mr. Greco's activities.   Mr. Tirado offered little more, but said he would if paida $10,000 &quot;honorarium.&quot; After considerable soul-searching,Mr. Safra, worried about the propriety of paying a foreigndiplomat, decided against making the payment.   It was the last time the Safra executives heard from Mr.Tirado, but his call persuaded them to bring in expert help.An even greater impetus was the continued spread ofanti-Safra articles, which began appearing in U.S.publications that spring of 1989. Mr. Safra hired StanleyArkin, a pugnacious New York attorney known for defendingfigures in Wall Street's insider-trading scandals, andcharged him with stopping the articles.   Before he could stop the articles, Mr. Arkin saw, he hadto know what was behind them. For investigative work Mr.Arkin turned to Palladino andamp; Sutherland, a small but respectedSan Francisco detective agency known for work on behalf offallen auto executive John Z. DeLorean. The firm is run by ahusband-and-wife team, Jack Palladino, an attorney and formerFord Fellow, and Sandra Sutherland, who is also a publishedpoet.   Mr. Arkin's charge was simple: Find out whether theanti-Safra articles represent an organized campaign. If so,was American Express behind it? And who was the mysteriousMr. Greco?   Aware that reporters don't typically turn overconfidential sources to strangers, much less privatedetectives, Ms. Sutherland journeyed to Europe that springunder disguise. In visits to publications in France, Italyand Switzerland, she posed as an Australian free-lance writerresearching Mr. Safra for a book on money-laundering. AtMinute and La Depeche, journalists promised to put her intouch with their Safra sources. At both stops, she was shownthe same strange, hand-drawn chart purporting to link Mr.Safra to many criminal organizations. Clearly, Ms. Sutherlandreported to Mr. Arkin, the articles were coming from a singlesource.   Ms. Sutherland had hoped her inquiries might flush out theanti-Safra sources, and before long, she succeeded. Arrivingin Geneva in April 1989, Ms. Sutherland had just checked intoa hotel when her phone rang. A deep, ominous voice, speakingin Italian, told her: &quot;I'm a friend. You don't know who I am,but we should talk.&quot; The talk went nowhere, but the Americandetective had a strong hunch her bait had been taken.   At the same time, Ms. Sutherland became aware thatsomeone, perhaps the mysterious caller, was counterattacking,spreading rumors that she was working for the CIA. Some Swissjournalists canceled meetings with her as a result.   As Ms. Sutherland crisscrossed Europe, Mr. Safra's forcespressed parallel investigations in Latin America and the U.S.A Palladino detective was dispatched to Peru, where he posedas a journalist in search of information on Mr. Greco. InPeru, he found, Mr. Greco was known as an internationalbusinessman with a large home in Spain, outside Barcelona.   Mr. Arkin, meanwhile, was tipped that the elusive Mr.Greco had a second home on a secluded cul-de-sac in anItalian area of New York's Staten Island. The lawyer broughtin a second detective agency, a Connecticut-based group offormer FBI agents. These detectives kept Mr. Greco's homeunder surveillance and even went through his garbage. But Mr.Greco seemed to be constantly traveling, and they made littleprogress.   By May 1989, Mr. Arkin's luck was changing. In Paris, Ms.Sutherland had begun negotiations with a Minute reporter tomeet the paper's source. One meeting fell through when thesource didn't show. When the source finally arrived in earlyMay, Ms. Sutherland was out of touch in Australia. Indesperation Mr. Arkin directed that Ms. Sutherland's Parisiantranslator, an aging former starlet named Sophie Hardy, besent to the meeting.   Identifying himself as &quot;Jaime,&quot; a journalist based inSantiago, Chile, &quot;the source&quot; turned out to be a small,swarthy man of 50 or so who, over dinner at an expensiveChinese restaurant on the Champs Elysees, questioned Ms.Hardy intently about Ms. Sutherland. &quot;He was a very strangeperson . . . acting like a spy,&quot; recalls Ms. Hardy. &quot;He toldme I had been duped, that {Ms. Sutherland} was working withthe CIA.&quot; When Ms. Hardy was unable to reveal more about Ms.Sutherland -- she didn't know her true identity -- &quot;all of asudden he launched into this very brutal behavior&quot; andabruptly ended the dinner, Ms. Hardy recalls.   When Ms. Sutherland reached Paris several weeks later, sheshowed Ms. Hardy pictures of several unidentified men,including a surveillance photo of Mr. Greco. &quot;Yes]&quot; Ms. Hardyexclaimed, pointing to Mr. Greco. &quot;That's him]&quot;   All that remained was linking Mr. Greco to AmericanExpress, something Mr. Safra's lawyers were uncomfortablyaware they hadn't yet done. Frustrated, Mr. Arkin switchedsurveillance teams on Mr. Greco's Staten Island home,dropping the Connecticut detectives and hiring a thirdagency. Within days the new team got a break. An operativefollowed Mr. Greco's car to Bouley, a discreet, lowerManhattan restaurant, where Mr. Greco was photographed diningwith an unidentified woman. Afterward the detective shadowedMr. Greco as he dropped off the woman at an apartmentbuilding on Central Park West. On a hunch, Mr. Arkin put asecond tail on the woman. The next day detectives followedher to work. As the surprised operatives looked on, the womandisappeared inside American Express headquarters.                                                                                                          Harry Freeman Launches   His `Secret Weapon'                                                                                                          The woman's name was Susan Cantor, and she was a newlyminted senior vice president at American Express Bank,specializing in wealthy Latin American clients. But as aformer associate producer of investigative projects for ABCNews, Ms. Cantor was no ordinary banker. More than a yearbefore Mr. Greco's activities attracted notice, her mix ofinvestigative and journalistic talents had made Ms. Cantor sovaluable that Harry Freeman referred to her as his &quot;secretweapon&quot; in the fight against Edmond Safra.   Ms. Cantor joined ABC in the early 1980s after receiving amasters degree in international relations from Yale in 1981.Moving from posts in a documentary unit to World News Tonightto the investigative unit, she became known as an avidconspiracy theorist whose intelligence, ambition and LatinAmerican expertise seldom translated into solid stories.   One of her former ABC supervisors describes Ms. Cantor asmore adept at conspiratorial thinking than journalism. &quot;Shewas great on the latest conspiracy theory coming off theHill, the latest person running the secret war in Nicaragua,&quot;the supervisor says. &quot;I would say, `Susan go nail it down.'And she couldn't nail it down.&quot;   In a statement released yesterday, Ms. Cantor says sheresigned in 1986 to pursue other opportunities. Some ABCco-workers say that decision came after her boss repeatedlysuggested she wasn't suited for network news. Her failure totranslate rumor and theory into usable Latin American storieshad alienated a number of correspondents.   In early 1987, at a time when American Express's fear ofMr. Safra was approaching its height, Mr. Freeman interviewedand hired Ms. Cantor for a job in American Express's publicrelations department. Walter Montgomery, then the departmenthead, told co-workers Ms. Cantor's television experiencewould be invaluable. But Ms. Cantor wasn't destined to domuch P.R. work. Almost immediately upon her hiring, Mr.Freeman tapped her for a top-secret &quot;special assignment.&quot;   When American Express Bank officials began raising thealarm about Mr. Safra in the mid-1980s, they had found awilling ear in Mr. Freeman. Trained as a lawyer, he had cometo American Express in 1975 after years of government work asan executive for the Overseas Private Investment Corporation.Of the four top aides who shared American Express's 51stfloor executive suite, Mr. Freeman was probably closest tohis boss. Though half his duties were supervising thecompany's extensive government, advertising and corporaterelations apparatus, Mr. Freeman always said the other halfwas &quot;crisis of the day&quot; work with Mr. Robinson.   Though his ideas could be innovative, as when dealing withinternational trade, his penchant for unorthodox projectsworried American Express lawyers. In 1987, for example, Mr.Freeman was blamed internally when American Express admittedit had secretly funded a supposedly nonbiased newsletter'ssurvey of credit card interest rates that The Wall StreetJournal routinely referred to until it learned of AmericanExpress' involvement. Mr. Freeman said at the time he sawnothing wrong with funding the newsletter.   As bank executives in Europe probed charges that Mr. Safrawas hiring away employees, Mr. Freeman grew convinced thatMr. Safra was intent on destroying American Express Bank. Hebegan collecting the darkest rumors about Mr. Safra, that hewas involved in money laundering, drug trafficking and hadties to the CIA and French and Israeli intelligence.   Ms. Cantor's &quot;special assignment&quot; to investigate theserumors initially centered on allegations reported by Swisspapers and the New York Times in December 1986, that a planeowned by Mr. Safra may have been used to transport formernational security advisor Robert MacFarlane to Iran as partof talks in the Iran-Contra affair. Interviews with Europeanjournalists, as well as current and former American Expressofficials, suggest that in the coming months, Ms. Cantor'smission evolved from gathering information on Mr. Safra'splane, to helping reporters investigate him, to spreadingrumors and negative articles on the banker's alleged drugties.   Ms. Cantor said in her statement: &quot;I never intended orsought to disseminate false information concerning EdmondSafra to anyone, and I never instructed, asked or engagedanyone to spread such information.&quot;   From the beginning, she sought to hide her ties toAmerican Express. In February 1987 she traveled to Geneva,where she met with at least two journalists, including MayaJurt, a veteran Swiss writer who had reported the story ofMr. Safra's plane two months earlier. When Ms. Cantor dinedat Ms. Jurt's home on February 8, she didn't mention AmericanExpress. &quot;She said she was writing a big piece on Iran Contrafor Time magazine,&quot; recalls Ms. Jurt. &quot;She wanted to knowwhat I had {on Mr. Safra}, what kind of proof I had. I showedher all my documents.&quot;   By the time Ms. Cantor returned to New York, she hadgathered quite a bit of information. A former ABC producerwho kept in touch with her recalls, &quot;She begins to blow in myear, `Hey, Safra this; hey Safra that; hey, MacFarlane and aplane that.' I said, `Hey, if you can confirm any of this, Imight be interested.' But she couldn't.&quot;   Her file on Mr. Safra bulging with European news articlesand records from Geneva's corporate registry, Ms. Cantor nexttraveled to Washington to share it with the House selectcommittee investigating the Iran-Contra affair. Joseph P.Saba, a staff counsel probing Oliver North's various Swisstransactions, met Ms. Cantor in a public room in the capitolone day when she arrived unannounced, file in hand.   Ms. Cantor identified herself &quot;as a former journalistwhose current employer knew nothing of what she was doing,&quot;Mr. Saba recalls. &quot;She said she was doing it for primarilyjournalistic reasons.&quot;   The lawyer, accustomed to zealots with similarly vagueexplanations, took Ms. Cantor's file and promised toinvestigate. In coming months, as Mr. Saba followed leadafter dubious lead on Mr. Safra, Ms. Cantor phoned andvisited frequently. &quot;It was always, `Here's what I've got,what do you think?' And my answer was, `Not much,'&quot; says Mr.Saba.   At one point, Mr. Saba asked the committee's press liaisonto find out more about Ms. Cantor. When he learned that sheworked for American Express, &quot;we said that was fine,&quot; Mr.Saba recalls. &quot;Motive wasn't something I was interested in.&quot;When Mr. Saba confronted her, Ms. Cantor acknowledged workingfor American Express. She told him stories about her snoopingtrips to Europe, insisting her work was for personal reasons.   When not probing Mr. Safra, Ms. Cantor assumed a number ofduties at American Express that placed her in direct contactwith the chairman, Mr. Robinson. Former executives say Ms.Cantor spent much of her New York time working for Mr.Robinson on his much publicized plan to solve the Third Worlddebt crisis. Among her jobs was assembling briefing books forMr. Robinson and arranging Mr. Robinson's schedule for hisLatin American trips; in this role, she once quizzed a WallStreet Journal international banking reporter on officialsfor Mr. Robinson to visit in Mexico City. A former banker inShearson Lehman's debt group says she also took on heftierduties, mediating, at Mr. Robinson's request, a disputebetween Shearson and American Express Bank over how to handlethe bank's Third World debt.   Much of her focus, however, continued to be on Mr. Safra.In the months to come, Ms. Cantor punctuated her increasinglyfrequent European travels with whirlwind stops by AmericanExpress's London office, where her appetite for dirt on Mr.Safra was matched only by her willingness to talk about it.To other executives Ms. Cantor spoke excitedly of how shechanged her hair color and appearance on her travels and ofhow she secretly photographed Mr. Safra's villa, La Leopolda.   In September 1987 Ms. Cantor returned to Geneva, where shemet with Irene Hirsch, a Swiss-based economic correspondentfor a Spanish paper. She told Ms. Hirsch she was working on a&quot;top secret story&quot; on the Iran-Contra affair to appear in TheWashington Post. Ms. Hirsch, who knew Ms. Cantor actuallyworked for American Express, was confused. &quot;Why was somebodyworking for American Express saying they were working for TheWashington Post?&quot; she wondered. &quot;I felt in some way she wasfishy.&quot;   Ms. Cantor's poses seemed to change from stop to stop.While dining at Maya Jurt's Geneva home September 1, she toldthe writer she was researching a book on Mr. Safra and theIran-Contra affair.   Ms. Cantor denies ever having posed as an author, or as areporter for Time or the Washington Post. She also deniesever having disguised her appearance.   Ms. Jurt, who was working on a second article on Mr.Safra, responded eagerly when Ms. Cantor, offering to help,referred her to Mr. Saba, the Iran-Contra lawyer. Eager toswap leads, Mr. Saba faxed Ms. Jurt copies of telexespertaining to the use of Mr. Safra's plane. Ms. Jurt usedthis information in an article exploring the banker'spossible Iran-Contra connections in Bilanz, a Swiss magazine,two months later. (By that time Mr. Saba had met with Mr.Safra's attorneys and concluded that neither the banker norhis plane had any significant role in the Iran-Contraaffair.)   When Ms. Cantor faxed the names of pilots believed to haveflown Mr. Safra's plane, Ms. Jurt was surprised to see anAmerican Express &quot;telltale&quot; on the fax. &quot;I asked her pointblank, didn't she think it was very incompatible, what shewas doing,&quot; Ms. Jurt says. &quot;She said, yes, it was verydifficult,&quot; explaining that she was working for AmericanExpress part-time because she needed the money, Ms. Jurtadds. &quot;She was very smooth about the whole thing.&quot; Later Ms.Cantor boasted of her Latin American travels with Mr.Robinson, although she never said that Mr. Robinson knew ofher Safra activities.   For his part, Mr. Saba, who learned the full dimensions ofAmerican Express's activities years later, says of hisdealings with Ms. Cantor, &quot;I'm a little pissed that I gotused.&quot;   Irked as well, Ms. Jurt says she refused to follow upwhen, in coming months, Ms. Cantor slipped her articles fromPeru, France and Mexico alleging Mr. Safra's ties to drugtraffickers. &quot;That stuff she gave me, I just said, `I won'ttouch it,'&quot; Ms. Jurt says. &quot;It was ridiculous. Just because apaper reported something, that doesn't mean it's worthprinting.&quot;   Ms. Cantor frequently telephoned Mr. Freeman from Europein the presence of co-workers and journalists, and even toldone journalist, Ms. Hirsch, she was working for Mr. Freeman.But some people sympathetic to Mr. Freeman insist he didn'tknow details of her work and didn't supervise her closely.                                                                                                          Trafficking in Rumor:   The Evolution of a Smear                                                                                                          By early 1988, when Switzerland approved the licensing ofMr. Safra's new bank, Mr. Freeman's concern about Mr. Safrahad deepened. To him, the Swiss move only showed how powerfulthe banker was. By the time Mr. Smith and his aides beganscrambling to keep customers from defecting to Mr. Safra thatspring, Mr. Freeman had approved the hiring of a privatedetective, Antonio &quot;Tony&quot; Greco. His activities would leadAmerican Express' campaign against Mr. Safra into a new, moreaggressive phase.   According to several former American Express executives,Mr. Greco's employment was suggested by Paul Knight, a formerfederal narcotics agent and chief of American Expresssecurity for Europe and the Middle East. Mr. Greco was saidto be a discreet, professional investigator. He had done workfor American Express for more than a decade.   Police records in two countries, however, paint adifferent picture of Mr. Greco. The detective has a record ofarrests and convictions in Italy and the United States goingback to 1962. He has also, several former law enforcementprofessionals acknowledge, operated as a paid informant for anumber of government agencies. A Wall Street Journal requestto review his file at the Immigration andamp; NaturalizationService's New York office was denied because, in the words ofspokesman Charles Troy, &quot;the file appears to be classified.&quot;   &quot;Greco peddles information; he's fairly well known in thelaw enforcement community,&quot; says Michael Hershman, a formerfederal investigator and head of Fairfax Group, a privatesecurity agency. &quot;There's a thousand guys like him around;he's not unusual. What is unusual is that a company likeAmerican Express would use someone like that. That strikes meas poor judgment.&quot;   Working with government agencies and American Express,however, hasn't kept Mr. Greco out of trouble. According to acomputer printout that appears to be Mr. Greco's completeItalian criminal record, he was convicted in 1982 ofconspiracy and handling stolen goods by a court in Genoa,Italy, and sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison.Earlier, in 1980, the document indicates, a court in Rome hadconvicted Mr. Greco of theft and sentenced him to a year inprison. According to the document, both sentences werecommuted as part of a general amnesty. In the U.S., Mr. Grecowas arrested at least five times between 1968 and 1972 for avariety of offenses ranging from smuggling to carrying anunlicensed pistol; each of the charges was subsequentlydropped. Mr. Greco couldn't be reached for comment.   It is unclear whether Mr. Freeman or Ms. Cantor knew ofMr. Greco's criminal record. For Mr. Freeman, hiring adetective wasn't unusual: American Express retains anestimated 200 or more investigators, many of them former NewYork City policemen and FBI agents, to combat credit card andtravelers check fraud.   Some at American Express say Mr. Freeman believed that Mr.Greco was only gathering, not spreading, information on Mr.Safra, and Mr. Freeman has told friends he has never evenseen the detective. There is evidence that suggests Mr. Grecoreported to Ms. Cantor, who reported to Mr. Freeman.   Still, when Mr. Greco began traveling on his newassignment, it was Mr. Freeman who approved his expenses.According to a person who saw Mr. Greco's contract in 1988,the detective was paid $15,000 a month, plus $500 a day inexpenses.   Full details of Mr. Greco's travels for American Expressare presumably still in the company's files. But he can belinked to at least three of the most widely distributedarticles charging Mr. Safra with criminal activities. At LaDepeche, the French paper that alleged Mr. Safra's drug linksin March and August 1988, reporter Jacques Bertrandacknowledges knowing Mr. Greco, at one point calling him his&quot;ami,&quot; or his friend, but wouldn't elaborate.   According to a person who has known Mr. Greco for 25years, in early 1988 Mr. Greco looked up his old friendVictor Tirado in Lima, Peru, and told him he was interestedin placing a story in the newspaper Hoy, where Mr. Tirado hadonce worked as a columnist. Mr. Tirado, this person says,gave Mr. Greco a contact at Hoy, then thought little aboutthe matter until seeing the paper's article on Mr. Safra'sdrug ties and remembering Mr. Greco's own comments about thebanker.   The selection of Hoy may not have been accidental. ThePeruvian newspaper, like the French newspaper Minute, hascarried anti-Semitic articles, according to Morton Rosenthal,a Latin American expert for the Anti-Defamation League ofB'Nai B'Rith. Mr. Rosenthal, who looked into the Safra affairat Mr. Safra's request, says the Peruvian article wasreprinted in the Mexico City newspaper, Uno Mas Uno, afterbeing transmitted by a Lima representative of Prensa Latina,the official news agency of Cuba.   The most detailed version of Mr. Greco's activities comesfrom former journalists at Minute, the Parisian newspaperthat printed articles linking Mr. Safra to criminal elementsranging from the Mafia to the Medellin Cartel. Jean Roberto,the senior reporter who wrote the articles, says in aninterview that Mr. Greco first contacted Minute in August1988, identifying himself as a detective probingmoney-laundering activities and hinting that he worked forthe CIA or the FBI. Mr. Greco promised to supply informationon a prominent banker -- who turned out to be Mr. Safra --who was laundering money for, among others, former Panamaniandictator Manuel Noriega.   In coming months, Mr. Roberto says, he met regularly withMr. Greco, often at his hotel, The Intercontinental. Eachtime Mr. Greco offered more sensational tales about Mr.Safra, complete with graphs charting his criminal contacts,and documents, including an Interpol inquiry on Mr. Safra'sIran-Contra links. Mr. Roberto printed the document alongsidehis first article on Mr. Safra, &quot;Billionaire of the WhiteStuff.&quot;   When Mr. Greco claimed that Mr. Safra was living in fearof Colombian drug traffickers he had double-crossed, Mr.Roberto wrote in a second article that Mr. Safra was hidingout in his Riviera estate, &quot;perspiring in fear&quot; of the drugcartel's assassins. Mr. Greco also passed on clippings fromHoy and other newspapers as well as photos of La Leopolda,all of which Minute used in its increasingly lurid articles.   Whether by accident or design, the seed Mr. Greco plantedspread to other publications, as Mr. Roberto shared hisinformation and documents with other European journalists.Mr. Roberto, for instance, recalls &quot;spending an afternoon&quot;with Jean-Claude Buffle, a Swiss journalist who has sincewritten extensively on Mr. Safra's supposed drug ties in amagazine named L'Hebdo. Mr. Buffle's stories, in turn, werefollowed by other Swiss reporters, who produced a spate ofarticles linking Mr. Safra to drug money in 1989. Mr. Safrahas gained retractions from some publications; others, likeL'Hebdo, he has sued.   &quot;Mr. Greco had a lot of information about Mr. Safra, andthat's why I had confidence in him,&quot; says Mr. Roberto, whohas left Minute. Adds Jean-Claude Goudeau, Mr. Roberto'seditor at the time: &quot;Greco seemed solid.&quot; Asked why Mr. Grecowould choose to pass information to Minute, which is knownfor anti-Semitism, Mr. Roberto says simply: &quot;Because Mr.Safra is a Jew.&quot;                                                                                                          What Was Susan Cantor   Up To, Anyway?                                                                                                          As anti-Safra articles began appearing in internationalpublications, the Safra effort encountered some internalopposition. In mid-summer 1988, James McGrath, then AmericanExpress' world-wide security chief, telephoned Mr. Ricciardi,the associate general counsel whose duties includedoverseeing the company's security force. Mr. McGrath wascurious why Ms. Cantor had called and, invoking Mr.Robinson's name, told the London security chief, Mr. Knight,to return to New York &quot;for a very important meeting.&quot;   After Mr. McGrath related the call, a puzzled Mr.Ricciardi phoned Ms. Cantor. According to a person familiarwith the conversation, their exchange went like this: &quot;Whoare you investigating?&quot; Mr. Ricciardi asked.   &quot;I'm not sure I can say,&quot; Ms. Cantor replied. But when Mr.Ricciardi pressed, Ms. Cantor said it was Mr. Safra.   &quot;This is very important,&quot; she explained. &quot;I work for HarryFreeman. This is for Jim Robinson. This is his show.&quot;   Mr. Ricciardi seemed wary when Mr. Freeman's name wasmentioned. &quot;You tell Jim Robinson to call me if he wants touse Paul Knight,&quot; he told Ms. Cantor. There's no indicationMr. Robinson ever did so. It was at that point, however, thata worried Mr. Ricciardi, with Mr. McGrath in tow, went to Mr.Freeman's office and warned him to stop whatever he wasdoing.   In coming months Mr. Ricciardi repeated his concerns toMr. Beller, and to his superior, Aldo Papone, head of thetravel-related services unit, American Express' largest, anda member of the company's board. But those concerns weren'texpressed to Mr. Robinson, the man in a position to stop theoperation.   Despite intense secrecy, hints of the Safra project waftedthrough American Express. &quot;We heard there was investigativework going on,&quot; says a former executive in travel-relatedservices, &quot;but the word coming down from corporate was,`Don't get your noses in it.'&quot;   One person who grew curious was Bob Smith at AmericanExpress Bank, who became Ms. Cantor's new boss when shetransferred from public relations into a bank position withloosely defined duties in mid-1988. Mr. Smith says he hiredMs. Cantor after a phone call from Mr. Robinson, whosuggested she might be useful in courting Latin Americanclients.   Different people give different reasons for Ms. Cantor'stransfer. Two people familiar with the move say Ms. Cantorwas shifted after pressure from the general counsel, Mr.Beller, who purportedly wanted to distance her anti-Safrawork from Mr. Robinson and other executives; Ms. Cantor toldat least one bank executive this. Other people familiar withMs. Cantor's work said they knew of no such pressure. Ms.Cantor, these people say, simply wanted a &quot;line position&quot;that would give her greater responsibility. &quot;She told me JimRobinson told her to get a line job, that it would be goodfor her career,&quot; recalls a former Shearson executive.   Whatever the case, in her new position Ms. Cantorcontinued reporting to Mr. Freeman, spending much of her timeon the Safra project. Mr. Smith knew Ms. Cantor wasinvestigating Mr. Safra, but says he was told her findingswere to be passed on to Swiss and other European bankregulators, not newspapers. Ms. Cantor was handling paymentsto Mr. Greco, and at her request, Mr. Smith took over thetask of approving them, sometimes in increments of $30,000 ormore.   &quot;I did it because Harry Freeman had approved what she wasdoing,&quot; Mr. Smith says today. &quot;{Cantor} was working forFreeman, a corporate vice president, who worked directly forRobinson. I had no need to protect my ass.&quot;   Mr. Smith was the only bank executive with an inkling ofMs. Cantor's actual duties, and below him, rumors about herswirled. Ignorant of banking procedures, Ms. Cantor embarkedon a training regimen that was frequently interrupted byunexplained overseas trips. Soon other executives, hearing ofher journalistic background and Latin American expertise,began whispering that Ms. Cantor was secretly working on anunauthorized book about American Express, or with theNicaraguan Contras.   Even Mr. Smith had doubts. &quot;To tell you the truth, Ialways thought she worked for the CIA,&quot; he says. Mr. Smithadds: &quot;She was always with Freeman. She had lunches withFreeman. She was always off with him . . . or on someRobinson project.&quot;   In addition, Ms. Cantor helped the bank, makingintroductions in Mexico and Venezuela. At a Mexico Citydinner celebrating the election of President Carlos Salinasde Gortari in 1988, &quot;she knew everyone at the table,&quot; Mr.Smith says, including a dozen senior Mexican officials. &quot;Inever went to a cocktail party with someone who knew so manypeople.&quot;   The bank wasn't the only one Ms. Cantor helped. At onepoint, according to a former Shearson executive, she urgedShearson to hire Mr. Greco in an effort to secure thePeruvian government as a client. After wrangling for weeksover a fee -- Mr. Greco insisted on being paid by the hour --the detective arranged a meeting in New York between Shearsonexecutives and a group of Peruvian officials, including thefinance minister. Though Shearson never got the business, atMs. Cantor's insistence Mr. Greco received about $15,000,says the former Shearson executive.   As Ms. Cantor settled in, Mr. Smith and his deputieswatched the surge of negative articles about Mr. Safra. Sooncustomers were asking who was behind them. Mr. Smith wasfairly sure he knew.   Worried that any wrongdoing might be blamed on the bank,Mr. Smith says he confronted Mr. Freeman about the Safraarticles and Ms. Cantor's &quot;special assignment&quot; in the fall of1988. &quot;I said, `What the hell is going on? Are you doinganything?'&quot; Mr. Smith recalls. &quot;He just kind of looked at meand smiled. I said, `Look, if you are involved in this,you're out of your mind.'&quot;   He continues: &quot;I told Harry, I told Susan, I had no desireto know what they were doing. I didn't want to know. I wantednothing to do with it.&quot; He says Mr. Freeman, while denyingthat he was spreading anti-Safra articles, told him: &quot;`Well,Susan is so busy with her banking now, it's just aboutover.'&quot;   After talking with Mr. Freeman, Mr. Smith says he begankeeping a close eye on Ms. Cantor. &quot;At that point in time, Isaid, `Let's make sure this gal is real busy,'&quot; he says. &quot;Westarted to really crank up the workload on her. We said,`Okay, you can't just fly off {someplace} if you feel likeit. You've got to tell us why you're going.' From that pointin time, she was pretty much under control.&quot;   Ms. Cantor was submerged in a crash course on banking and,by the fall of 1988, when Mr. Smith, Mr. Robinson and Ms.Cantor flew to Venezuela on an American Express jet, Mr.Smith was fairly certain her &quot;special assignment&quot; was over.                                                                                                          Final Confrontation: Safra   Plays His Trump Card                                                                                                          By the spring of 1989 anti-Safra articles were appearingin U.S. publications for the first time. Mr. Safra was sodesperate to end the articles that he began weighing criminalcharges against American Express. In an effort to avoid sucha high-profile maneuver, the banker flew to New York toconfront Mr. Robinson with his growing suspicions.   &quot;We know it's your people, Jim,&quot; he told Mr. Robinson in amid-March meeting at Mr. Safra's Manhattan apartment. Mr.Robinson said he would be &quot;dumbfounded&quot; if it were true, butpromised to look into the matter. Ten days later Mr. Robinsontold Mr. Safra he had checked and found no evidence of asmear campaign. American Express' explanation, spokenprivately, has been that Mr. Freeman, ignorant of the extentof what Mr. Greco and Ms. Cantor were doing, told Mr.Robinson this.   Then in May Mr. Safra's lawyer, Mr. Arkin, suggested amore subtle threat. After a thorough review by Mr. Safra'saides, the lawyer published, in his regular column for theNew York Law Journal that June, the hypothetical story of acorporate executive who &quot;cherishes his Boy Scout image,&quot; butwhose aides had spread rumors that a competitor was involvedin the drug business. &quot;Spreading false of malicious rumor orflat-out lies . . . may well amount to a criminal fraud,&quot; Mr.Arkin mused in the column.   According to a top American Express executive, neither Mr.Robinson nor his aides initially saw the intended shot acrosstheir bow. The fact that Mr. Safra was mulling criminalcharges came to American Express's attention via a circuitousroute: Then Shearson Chairman Peter A. Cohen learned of itfrom a top private detective, Jules Kroll, who had heard itfrom a friend of Mr. Arkin.   Days later, Mr. Safra was in his Geneva office when asecretary told him Mr. Robinson was on the phone. &quot;JimRobinson?&quot; he asked in amazement. According to a personfamiliar with their conversation, an angry Mr. Robinsondidn't mention Mr. Arkin's column, but told Mr. Safra: &quot;Iknow you've been following my people, and I want a stop putto it.&quot;   When Mr. Robinson finished, Mr. Safra replied simply:&quot;I've got you, Jim. We've got mountains of evidence. Don'ttell me about following your people. We've got you.&quot;                                                                                                          A Deal and an Apology,   But Is It Over?                                                                                                          By the end of June American Express lawyers begannegotiating a settlement with Mr. Arkin. To their inquiriesof how much the Safra forces knew, Mr. Arkin's mention of asingle name, &quot;Tony Greco,&quot; seemed enough. American Expressagreed to pay $8 million, half to Mr. Safra, half to fourcharities, to avoid a lawsuit or criminal charges.   American Express's subsequent internal investigation senta number of executives diving for cover. The general counsel,Mr. Beller, brought in representatives from three outside lawfirms, including a former U.S. Attorney, John Martin, Jr., tohandle the questioning.   According to a senior company official, Mr. Martinencountered unswerving denials from a number of keyexecutives thought to have knowledge of the Safra project. InLondon, Paul Knight, the American Express corporate securityofficial, walked into a colleague's office and announced thathis Safra file had mysteriously disappeared, a statement thecolleague took as a signal that his file should disappear aswell. Mr. Martin might have learned more had he interviewedjournalists like Mr. Roberto and Ms. Jurt, but they weren'tcontacted.   At American Express Bank, Ms. Cantor found herself anoutcast. &quot;Susan became a member of the lepers colony,&quot; says aformer bank executive. &quot;People didn't want to be seen withher. You didn't go into her office for fear you'd get a callfrom Gary Beller.&quot; In June, when Maya Jurt, the Swiss writer,last saw Ms. Cantor, she was pregnant, concerned about herbaby's health, and &quot;she looked 10 years older,&quot; Ms. Jurtsays.   Within a week of Mr. Robinson's public apology, Mr.Freeman announced his retirement. Mr. Freeman's fall wascushioned by consulting contracts with an estimated totalvalue of more than $100,000 a year. Privately, Mr. Freemanmaintained that Mr. Robinson had tried to get him to stay on.He also said that Mr. Robinson pledged to make him wholefinancially if he did choose to leave. Afterward Mr. Freemancontinued many of the same duties he had at American Express,including oversight of a lavish company-sponsored celebrationof Dwight Eisenhower's centennial. Today, he is one of themost respected experts on the multilateral trade talks inGeneva.   The results of American Express's internal investigationwere submitted to the audit committee of the company's board.That panel concluded, &quot;while the people involved -- all ofwhom said they did not intend to disseminate inaccurateinformation -- were motivated by what they considered to bethe company's best interests, their actions set off a chainof events that resulted in the maligning of a competitor.&quot;People familiar with the situation say the company has sincetightened its internal controls and disciplined Ms. Cantor bywithholding her 1989 bonus.   Ms. Cantor took a maternity leave, but if she thought shecould leave the murky world of corporate espionage behind,she was wrong. As Edmond Safra sorted through the damage tohis image, his operatives delved deeply into Ms. Cantor'slife and reported back on all they found. Susan Cantorultimately had her baby, and Mr. Safra's detectives knowwhere, when and how it was delivered.   Though Mr. Safra won a clear victory, he was far fromsatisfied. American Express refused to accede to a keyrequest: Identifying publications where its operatives spreadmisinformation. To do so, American Express felt, might betantamount to taking responsibility for rumors it didn'tdisseminate. Without that knowledge, Mr. Safra has beenunable to try to counter negative articles until they appear.Today he is regularly forced to rebut charges ofmoney-laundering and other nefarious activities. This springSafra lawyers scrambled to counter old charges in aGuatemalan newspaper, a French newswire report and a Swissauthor's book.
