One of the dissidents, 21-year-old student leader Wu'er Kaixi,told a news conference that the movement remains active in China andwill ``explode ... even larger than before.''   The Chinese student leaders had not been seen in public sincethey fled Beijing after the suppression. Communist Chineseauthorities had been on a nationwide lookout for the studentleaders, and the students did not elaborate on their escape.   China says 200-300 people were killed in the June 3-4 attack onstudents demonstrating for democratic reforms and an end to officialcorruption. Chinese sources and diplomatic reports put the deathtoll at about 3,000.   In a letter to the more than 30 heads of state in Paris for asummit of the world's industrialized democracies and forcelebrations marking the bicentennial of the French Revolution, thedissident leaders called for:   _Creating a U.N. investigative commission to look into themilitary assault and the wave of arrests and executions thatfollowed.   _Aiding the victims of the crackdown.   _Pressuring the Chinese government to halt repression, includingthe imposition of economic sanctions and the breaking of diplomaticrelations.   Wu'er, the most charismatic and well-known of the 21 studentleaders accused of ``counterrevolutionary crimes'' on the Chinesegovernment's most wanted list, said the pro-democracy movement willsurvive.   ``We think that in the near future a democratic student movementwill explode in China, even larger than before. There are somestudents in China who remain active, although obviously they have tobe very careful,'' he said, speaking through a French translator.   More than 2,000 people were arrested throughout China after thearmy crackdown.   Wu'er, a freshman at Beijing Normal University, was smuggled outof China to Hong Kong and then Paris with his girlfriend, Liu Yan,who also spoke to reporters.   They declined to provide details on how they escaped or wherethey had been staying, but said they had neither requested norreceived any special protection from the French government.   Yan Jiaqi, the leader of the dissident intellectual movement,said the main task facing those in self-imposed exile ``is to createan organization, not one of revolution but one of democracy.''   Chinese sources in Paris, speaking on condition of anonymity,said the dissidents hope to make Paris the permanent headquartersfor the pro-democracy movement in exile.   Shen Tong, a Beijing University student leader who fled to theUnited States, was among those at the news conference.   Others speaking to reporters included Li Lu, a Nanjing Universitystudent leader, Su Wei of the Beijing Academy of Social Sciences,Xin Ku of Lanzhou University and Wan Runnan, chairman of China'slargest private computer company, the Beijing Stone Group.   The company, set up about four years ago, had been praised as amodel for Chinese entrepreneurs.   A research institute set up by the company got involved insupporting the protests and distributed a petition to convene aspecial National People's Congress session to end martial law, whichwas declared in May.   Wan then wound up on the government's wanted list.   The open letter said the celebration of the French Revolution``is not just a celebration for the people of France but for all ofhumanity in its fight against dictatorship, despotism and tyranny.''   ``We are convinced that a tempest even stronger is imminent. ...This fortress of despotism, the oldest and most persistent in theworld, will be upset by the force of the people, and the republicanflag founded on freedom, democracy ... and human rights will one dayfly over Chinese soil.''</TEXT></DOC>
