(multichip module packaging)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Costlow, Terry.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>Multichip module (MCM) designers are turning to the low cost andavailability of polyimide materials compared to the performancebenefits of other substrate technologies.andP;  Polyimide costs rangefrom $2 to $3 per square inch, compared with $20 to $300 persquare inch for thin-film substrates like silicon.andP;  Silicon andother thin-film substrates are expected to eventually take theleading role in MCMs, deposited material substrates will dominate.andO;Polyimides provide a safe, low-cost way to produce MCM productsquickly, due to the research and expertise available for themicrocomputer-board material.andP;  Improvements in polyimideprocessing are also driving its acceptance in the MCM field.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     SubstratesMultichip ModulesChip SetsIntegrated CircuitsTrendsPackagingThin FilmsThick FilmsCeramics.andO;Feature:   illustrationtable.andO;Caption:   Chip packaging: weighing your choices.
