But their Pampers, Luvs and Huggies are feeling pressure from environmentalists,who claim the diapers devour landfill space and threaten ground water,and from a fledgling industry making non-chemical diapers said to decomposein a decade.    ___</BYLINE><BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   At a recent Kimberly-Clark meeting for WallStreet security analysts, the hard questions weren't about profits,sales projections or stock dividends, but when to expect abiodegradable diaper.   Last month, the Nebraska legislature passed a bill that willoutlaw the sale of nondegradable diapers Oct. 1, 1993. Similar lawshave been discussed in Oregon, Iowa and Washington.   For diaper makers, ``the environment has become a fairly hotissue in the last six months,'' said Bonita Austin, who follows theconsumer product industry for the investment firm WertheimSchroeder andamp; Co. Further legislation would intensify pressure onmanufacturers, she said.   The outcry has startled America's $3.5 billion diaper industry,which first introduced the disposable a quarter-century ago and hassince found an immense market for the bundles of tissue, wood pulp,liquid-gobbling chemicals and fancy plastic that sell for up to 25cents apiece.   The last thing these companies expected was an ecologicalboomerang from a product that has earned enormous profits and isstill considered one of the most successful innovations evercreated.   Lawmakers, consumers, investors and ecologists say thedisposable diaper presents an environmental threat as both a bulkysingle-use product that cannot be recycled and as a potentialdisease carrier.   Pandamp;G and Kimberly-Clark aren't saying exactly how they'replanning to respond, although both are believed to be working ondegradable alternatives.   Together, the companies account for about 75 percent of thebusiness of disposable diapers, still embraced by a generation ofgrateful parents. Luvs and Pampers are Pandamp;G's largest product group,with roughly $1.65 billion in annual domestic sales, whileKimberly-Clark sells about $840 million worth of its Huggies eachyear in the United States, analysts say.   Despite their enormous size and marketing reach, however, thecompanies have yet to respond to the growing demand for diapersthat decompose. That has left a hole smaller companies already arefilling.   For example, RMed International Inc. of Tulsa, Okla., hasstarted marketing TenderCare, a non-chemical, degradable diaper thecompany claims breaks down to hydrogen, oxygen and carbon in adecade.   ``It's not perfect, but it's a heck of a lot better than 500years,'' said Suzanne Shelton-Foley, RMed's vice president ofmarketing.   Sales have gone from zero to 40,000 boxes a month since thecompany introduced them five months ago, which is consideredremarkably strong since most are sold in health-food stores or overthe telephone.   TenderCare covers contain a plastic that is 6 percentcornstarch. This innovation not only accelerates the decompositionprocess but has also won support from the National Corn GrowersAssociation, which sees a sprawling new market for corn.   The association joined forces with environmentalists to lobbyfor the Nebraska law.   In 1987, the diaper industry used 177 million pounds of plastic.``That would mean millions of bushels of corn!'' enthused TimDraeger, the association's marketing development assistant.   Some experts say diaper makers could easily convert tostarch-impregnated plastics. But manufacturers counter that theywould have to use considerably more of that material to make asufficiently strong outer cover.   The diaper giants maintain that the technology to make a trulydegradable plastic isn't available.   ``They're definitely working on it, but I don't think it'simminent,'' said Austin, the securities analyst. ``It's not theeasiest technological gap to hurdle, and they can't make the claimunless the diaper is truly degradable.''   Pandamp;G spokesman T. Scott Stewart said the company has found noevidence that cornstarch-based plastics quickly degrade if buriedin modern landfills, partly because conventional decompositionrequires light and oxygen.   Kimberly-Clark is ``spending a lot of time and effort to find asubstitute for the plastic components that would readily degrade ina landfill environment,'' said spokeswoman Tina Barry.   A small but growing number of environmentally sensitizedconsumers are rejecting any disposable diaper, biodegradable ornot. They're turning back to reusable cloth.   ``There's a heightened consciousness among the enlightenedpeople of this country that we cannot go on trashing our world,''said Jeff Johnston, head of Tiny Tots Diaper Service in Saginaw,Mich., and president of the National Diaper Service Association.   Over the last few months, Johnston said, his business is up 35percent, and he estimated services around the country areexperiencing similar surges.   Cloth diapers account for 10 to 15 percent of all the diapersused. Energized by the growing demand, the diaper serviceassociation plans to spend $120,000 on advertising next year,promoting cotton diapers as an alternative.   That's a lot of money for the diaper assocation, but nothingcompared with the megabudgets for advertising and promotion spentby Pandamp;G and Kimberly-Clark, which are expected continue to boosttheir products vigorously even if they're quietly researchingalternatives.   The big diaper companies oppose legislation that would ban orrestrict non-degradable disposables, since by their reckoning theseproducts account for less than 1 percent of solid waste in thecountry.   Moreover, the diaper giants are giving no outward indicationthey plan to shrink their lines of disposables because of theenvironmental issue. On the contrary, they've been expanding themwith gimmicks that range from elasticized waistbands to MickeyMouse designs on the plastic linings.   Kimberly-Clark appears to have the latest edge, using technologythat allows fluid to flow in only one direction. The company claimsthis ensures diapers stay dry for hours after they're soiled. Italso has introduced disposable training pants called Pull-Ups thatsell for about 50 cents each.   Barry characterized claims by such small companies as RMed as``grandiose. ... We're not going to jump on that bandwagon. Whatpeople care about with a disposable diaper is performance, and ithas gained in popularity as the quality improved.''   Nonetheless, she said, if degradability ``becomes something themajority of consumers desire, it's certainly something we wouldhave to respond to.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Tues PMs, June 6</NOTE></DOC>
