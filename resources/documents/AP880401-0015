The performance of the Yanke Container Cop. has been so poorthat the Navy should immediately ``initiate debarment proceedings''to block the Boise, Idaho, company from receiving additionalcontracts, added Rear Adm. M.E. Chang in an audit report.   Moreover, the Navy needs to determine why its buying agentscontinued to use Yanke Container and why the service failed to takeadvantage of ``numerous opportunities to default the contractor ordemand consideration (penalty payments) ...,'' the report states.   ``Yanke Container Corp. contracts indicate a clear inability toperform to contract with regard to delivery and product quality,''the Navy auditors found. ``This inability has been repeatedlydemonstrated in contracts since 1982.''   Yanke handled nine of the 19 contracts it received since 1982 bydelivering ``312 defective new containers, resulting in over$118,000 in additional cost to the Navy,'' the auditors wrote.``Seven contracts were extended and five were delivered delinquentto contract.''   The 11-page audit report, which has yet to be released publicly,summarizes the results of an investigation requested last Decemberby Assistant Navy Secretary Everett Pyatt. The report was releasedby the Project on Military Procurement, a Washington-based groupthat helps whistle-blowers.   Yanke owner Richard Fish denied the accusations. ``Generally,most of that is untrue. We intend to have our day in court onthis.''   Fish said in Boise, Idaho, that he had not seen the report, andaccused the Navy of investigating his company ``behind our back. Wehave not been notified.''   ``Many of the things mentioned here are untrue,'' Fish said,declining to elaborate.   ``We are still looking at the facts,'' said Lt. Janet Mescus, aNavy spokeswoman.   ``Debarment is an option, but no decisions have been made. Wenormally try to work with small businesses to overcome problems asmuch as we can.''   Fish said he asked Sen. Steve Symms, R-Idaho, to intercede.   The Idaho Republican wrote to the Navy, saying that Yanke hadheard a competitor was challenging its continued eligibility forNavy contracts and wanted to know if that were true.   ``In our correspondence, we were asking the Navy to advise usand to advise Yanke just what their concerns were,'' said PhilReberger, Symms' chief of staff   ``The purpose of the inquiry from the senator was to ask whatwas the story here and when does Yanke get to respond (to theseallegations)? Yanke has not had an opportunity to address any ofthese concerns, and we certainly haven't had an opportunity toevaluate the matter.''   According to the audit report, the Navy has awarded Yanke 19contracts since 1982 worth $12.25 million to fabricate aluminum,fiberglass or steel boxes used to ship explosive armaments like theSparrow, Harm, Harpoon and Standard missiles and the Mk-46 torpedo.</TEXT></DOC>
