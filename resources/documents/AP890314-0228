But in Los Angeles, where the courts are as congested as thefreeways, it would take five years before a civil trial could beginto decide whether Miss Harper was wrongly fired or wrongly quit the``Valerie's Family'' TV series.   The lawyers took a shortcut: for $50,000, they got their ownjudge, bailiff, clerk and court reporter for a trial held in aleased public courtroom before a jury selected from the public rolls.   Within a year, the jury awarded Miss Harper $1.85 million indamages and a cut in Lorimar's future profits that could be worth$15 million.   In contrast, the Los Angeles Superior Court jury that last monthawarded Marc Christian $21.75 million did so nearly four years afterChristian filed a lawsuit against former lover Rock Hudson allegingthat the movie star concealed the fact he had AIDS. The huge awardis certain to be appealed.   With civil court systems seriously backlogged across the country,thousands of litigants are finding out that they can afford to renttheir own judge.   Retired jurists are returning to the bench for fees from $150 to$250 an hour. Companies arranging rent-a-judge cases are reportingrecord business. And litigants and lawyers say the speedy, privateproceedings are the best thing to come along in the American legalsystem since the Bill of Rights.   But the proliferation of such cases has many in legal circlesyelling ``objection.'' Critics say private adjudication oftendiscriminates against the poor, raises profound constitutionalquestions and may be luring fine judges off the bench for an early,lucrative retirement.   ``I'm worried that we're getting a two-tiered system of justice:one for the group of people who can afford to hire a judge and onefor the group of people who cannot,'' said American Bar AssociationPresident Robert Raven.   Attorneys for the poor and minorities want the legalestablishment to take a hard look at private adjudication andimplement what they call long-overdue reforms in the public system.   ``No one who is powerful enough in the public system is going towant to change it if there are other options. We're getting a deluxejustice system for the rich and a deteriorating form for the poor,''said Robert Gnaizda of Public Advocates, which provides legalservice for the poor and minorities.   An estimated 800,000 civil lawsuits will be filed in the UnitedStates this year, 100,000 of them in Los Angeles County where 60,000cases are backlogged and the wait for trial routinely stretchesthree to five years. The average wait nationwide is 18 months.   This legal gridlock creates an expensive waiting game thatgenerally ends as lawyers' fees mount and nerves crack. More than 95percent of civil cases are settled out of court, many within hoursbefore the scheduled start of a trial and after years of waiting.   Rent-a-judge firms offer an attractive alternative. The wait fora judge is about a month, many disputes are settled in a matter ofhours, and satisfaction is practically guaranteed. Fewer than 10percent of decisions are appealed.   ``We're getting busier and busier every month,'' said JohnTrotter, retired presiding justice of the California Court ofAppeals and now vice president of Judicial Arbitration and MediationServices in Santa Ana.   Judicial Arbitration, with 80 retired judges, hears more than 600cases a month. Its competitor, industry leader Judicate, ofPhiladelphia, predicts it will hear 10,000 cases this year, up from4,000 last year.   Such cases move smoothly because many trial rules are discardedand both sides have agreed on the judge and on whether the judgewill act as a mediator or issue a decision. If the judge makes aruling, the lawyers can file an appeal in the public court system,getting a big jump on everybody else.   ``We cut right to the problem,'' said Trotter. ``We don't havethe formalities, the requirements, the pretrial rigamarole of thepublic system. We're highly effective.''   These were the benefits attorneys in the Harper-Lorimar disputehad in mind when they hired retired Superior Court Judge WilliamHogoboom.   ``Things went smoothly. We selected a very competent judge, wereable to set a time schedule that we could stick to and rely on andset up whatever procedures were convenient,'' said Miss Harper'sattorney, Barry Langberg.   Lorimar wanted the dispute settled quickly out of fear itwouldn't be allowed to use the name ``Valerie'' in the title whilethe suit was pending. Miss Harper feared that allegations fromLorimar that she was a temperamental star would keep her fromworking elsewhere.   ``She wanted a quick trial and we wanted a quick trial. It workedout perfectly,'' said Lorimar attorney Donald Engel.   Miss Harper's battle with Lorimar has become one of the bestknown rent-a-judge cases, second perhaps only to the daily disputesaired nationally on ``The People's Court,'' essentially a televisedform of private adjudication.   But the Harper-Lorimar trial was unique in that it had a jury andall the judicial trimmings. Most rent-a-judge cases cover matterslike insurance claims or bickering between companies over tradesecrets heard before a lone judge.   Supporters of private adjudication say these disputes fall withinthe 95 percent of cases that would probably have been settled out ofcourt anyway   ``We're really not in competition with the courts,'' said WilliamMacQueen, vice president of Judicate. ``What we're doing is in factan alternative to a settlement negotiated by the parties. We areable to provide what people intended in the first place.''   Another benefit of the rent-a-judge system comes to litigantsseeking to keep their trial proceedings secret. Unlike public trialsin this country, the news media can be barred from rent-a-judgecourtrooms if both parties agree.   Raven and other skeptics concede there may be a place for therent-a-judge concept, that many disputes don't have to wallow in thecourts awaiting a trial that may not be necessary in the firstplace. They also want this kind of short-cut available to everyone,not just those who can afford it, and not at the expense of thepublic court system.   The ultimate solution is to make the public system better andeliminate much of the demand for rent-a-judges, Raven said. ``It'sthe attorneys who should be taking the lead on this. They should beshouting like hell.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, March 19</NOTE></DOC>
