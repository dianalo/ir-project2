In an address to the Los Angeles World Affairs Council, however,Lt. Gen. Colin D. Powell said he hoped that Congress would not be``tempted to try to limit presidential power.''   Powell said that ``divided, shared and countervailing powers arethe hallmarks of our system _ by design of the founding fathers.Weakening the presidency also weakens the country.''   The national security adviser did not say specifically whatimprovements had been brought about in administration dealings withCongress on foreign affairs issues, nor did he touch on the ongoingdispute with some lawmakers over Reagan's failure to invokeprovisions of the War Powers Act giving Capitol Hill a say in theuse of U.S. military force in the Persian Gulf.   Powell did say that the executive branch ``has an obligation tokeep its own house in order. There must be an adherence to law andto the Constitution, and a willingness to consult and deal openlyand respectfully with the Congress, taking legislative leaders intoits confidence on the most sensitive matters.''   ``I believe this administration, after the aberration ofIran-Contra, has re-established and enjoys such a coherent andcooperative process internally,'' Powell said. ``It has served thepresident and the country well.''   Two White House aides, John M. Poindexter and Oliver L. North,were ousted in the fall of 1986 as the Iran-Contra affair becamepublic. It involved the clandestine sales of U.S. arms to Iran andthe subsequent diversion of proceeds to the Nicaraguan rebels.   Reagan has persistenly maintained that no laws were broken, eventhough congressional investigations and hearings produced evidencethat members of Congress were widely deceived by administrationfigures.   North goes on trial Sept. 20 in Washington on an array ofcharges related to the arms-to-Iran affair.</TEXT></DOC>
