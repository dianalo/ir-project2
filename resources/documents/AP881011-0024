The building was shut down Saturday because of a ``minor safetyincident,'' according to the U.S. Energy Department. Three peoplewere tested for ``potential health effects'' stemming from lastmonth's incident, officials said.   Rockwell International Corp., which runs the plant, said noradioactive material was released nor was there any threat to thepublic or the environment.   Rockwell spokesman Ed Heintz said Monday that the shutdown wouldnot affect other areas of the plant, and the building's 575employees would not be laid off during the shutdown. The plantemploys about 5,000.   But Richard W. Starostecki, the Energy Department's top safetyexpert, told The New York Times that the shutdown was in a buildingwhere classified work vital to the entire plant's operation isperformed.   The shutdown essentially halts all production at the plant, hesaid, according to today's editions of the newspaper.   All three reactors at another nuclear weapons plant, theSavannah River Plant near Aiken, S.C., have been shut down sinceAugust when a mishap idled one of the reactors. The plant makesplutonium and tritium, which are used in nuclear weapons.   There are 13 other major production, waste and research plantsin 12 states involved in nuclear weapons production.   The Rocky Flats incident occurred Sept. 29 in Building 771 atthe plant 15 miles northwest of Denver. Heintz, who didn'telaborate on the incident, said it would be up to the EnergyDepartment to decide to reopen the building, and a restart teamalready had been set up.   Speaking in Washington, Starostecki said the order came aboutafter an Energy Department inspector and two Rockwell employeeswere contaminated by plutonium when they walked into an unmarkedroom where maintenance and cleanup work was being performed onplutonium-contaminated equipment.   Rockwell will conduct a semiannual inventory of nuclearmaterials in the building during the shutdown, the EnergyDepartment said.   It said Rockwell curtailed maintenance and construction in thebuilding Oct. 4 to review the situation. The review determinedamong other things that airborne radioactive contamination levelswere within government guidelines, but higher than Department ofEnergy goals.   Early this year, an Energy Department team reported ``seriousconcerns'' with radiation monitoring practices at the plant. Theteam spent a week auditing the plant and plutonium processing,paying what it termed close attention to the calibration of plantradiation measurement equipment.   At the Savannah River Plant, it was disclosed last week that upto 30 significant mishaps occurred during the past three decades,and that many had not been reported to Washington or disclosed tothe public.</TEXT></DOC>
