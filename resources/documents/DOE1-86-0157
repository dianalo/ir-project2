Such large samples are not suitable for conventional analyticalprocedures nor for neutron activation analysis under Czechoslovak conditions.GAA (gamma activation analysis) has proved suitable, where the sourceof photons of a maximum energy of several tens of MeV was the targetof the cyclic electron accelerator - the microtron. Two photonuclearreactions applicable for GAA are described: the photoexcitation reactionwhich is more suitable for the analysis, and the reaction which producesPt and Hg isotopes. Experimentally verified were the possibilities ofphotoexcitation determination of Au. Equipment and a procedure have beendeveloped for rapid Au determination using the GAA method. The main componentsof the equipment are: a microtron as the radiation source; an irradiationunit; a rabbit tube allowing the transport time between irradiation andmeasurement to be reduced to 1.8 - 2.5 secs; a detector consisting of4 NaI(Tl) scintillation probes with a resolution of andless; or approx. 7% forthe 661 keV line; multichannel analyzer CANBERRA 40 with 4096 channels;a SAPI microcomputer to which data is transmitted at a rate of 9600 Baud.The determinability limit of 0.4 ppm for Au, accuracy close to +-1% andhigh selectivity were achieved. 10 to 20 samples may be analyzed perhour at a cost of 50 to 60 crowns per one determination.
