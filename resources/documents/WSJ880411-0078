Their 1987 federal tax liability totaled $86,638 on adjusted gross income of $345,359, the returns said. For 1986, their liability was $92,460 on adjusted gross income of $336,640. Their federal tax burden last year amounted to 25% of their gross income, compared with 27.5% in 1986, the returns showed.    In addition to the president's $200,000 annual salary, the Reagans reported 1987 income of $59,943 from the blind trust set up after his election in 1980, $29,711 from his California governor's pension, $31,350 from the sale of Japanese paintings inherited by Mrs. Reagan from her mother, interest from bank accounts, and various rents and royalties, including $281 in royalties from Mr. Reagan's autobiography, &quot;Where's the Rest of Me?&quot;    The returns showed they gave $25,407 to charity, compared with $30,487 the prior year.    The Reagans overpaid their taxes by $10,754 and applied that refund to the tax liability for this year. When asked if the Reagans had as much trouble with the new, &quot;simplified&quot; tax system as many other taxpayers are having, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater replied: &quot;It was just as simple as it has been in past years.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
