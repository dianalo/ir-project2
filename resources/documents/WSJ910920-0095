An assistant district attorney told a state judge aboutthe extradition effort at a hearing that resulted in thepostponement of the arraignment of BCCI Holdings (Luxembourg)S.A., four of its subsidiaries, BCCI founder Agha Hasan Abediand Swaleh Naqvi, the bank's former chief executive, on statecriminal charges of fraud, money laundering, bribery andtheft.</LP><TEXT>   For the second time, Judge Peter J. McQuillan postponedthe arraignment for a month because none of the defendantswere represented by counsel.   Assistant District Attorney John Moscow said that hisoffice, the State Department and the U.S. Department ofJustice have begun extradition proceedings against Messrs.Abedi and Naqvi.   A spokesman for the district attorney's office, GeraldMcKelvey, said that state and federal authorities had begun&quot;the lengthy process&quot; of doing the necessary paperwork forrequesting Mr. Abedi's extradition from Pakistan, with whichthe U.S. has an extradition treaty.   In Mr. Naqvi's case, a letter has been sent to the StateDepartment, which in turn will be passed on to the governmentof Abu Dhabi, a principality of the United Arab Emirates, Mr.McKelvey said. The United States does not have an extraditiontreaty with the U.A.E.   A spokesman for the Department of Justice, which handlesextradition requests by local law enforcement authorities,would not comment on the case. A State Department spokesmansaid the department does not comment on the status ofextradition proceedings.   Senator John Kerry, (D., Mass), chairman of the SenateForeign Relation Committee's Subcommittee on Terrorism,Narcotics and International Operations, which isinvestigating BCCI, has also sent a letter to Sheikh Zayedal-Nahyan of Abu Dhabi requesting that he send Mr. Naqvi tothe U.S. The sheikh recently detained Mr. Naqvi and otherBCCI officials.   International law experts said that extraditing Mr. Naqviwould be difficult, and determined more by politicalpressures than legal concerns.   But as a U.S. official investigating the case pointed out,&quot;If the sheikh wants to put {Mr. Naqvi} on a plane, ain'tnobody going to stop him.&quot;   The treaty between the U.S. and Pakistan sets out formalprocedures for extraditions, but even then there are many&quot;wrinkles&quot; to overcome, said Ralph Steinhardt, an associateprofessor at George Washington Law School. Mr. Steinhardtsaid that financial crimes are not usually covered inextradition treaties. He also pointed out that Pakistan mayargue that the BCCI prosecution is political in nature andtherefore not covered by the treaty.   In accepting the month-long delay in arraigning the BCCIdefendants, Mr. Moscow also told the judge that court papersdetailing the charges had been served on the corporatedefendants, which include BCCI S.A., BCCI Overseas,International Credit Investment Company (Overseas Limited)and ICIC Holdings.   ---   PROSECUTORS DROPPED remaining charges against John A.Mulheren Jr.   The decision not to retry Mr. Mulheren on 26 counts ofconspiracy and securities fraud marks the end of thegovernment's case against the prominent trader accused ofaiding the wrongdoing of former arbitrager Ivan F. Boesky.   Earlier this year, a federal appeals court reversedconvictions on three counts of securities fraud and one countof conspiracy against Mr. Mulheren. What remained werecharges on which a jury last year could not reach a verdict.   A jury in 1990 found Mr. Mulheren guilty of allegedlymanipulating the stock price of Gulf andamp; Western IndustriesInc. at the behest of Mr. Boesky. But the appeals court inManhattan said the government proved neither that themanipulation occurred nor that Mr. Mulheren knew Mr. Boeskywould benefit from the trading.   In court papers filed yesterday in federal court inManhattan, the U.S. attorney's office said, among otherthings, that it based its decision not to retry Mr. Mulherenon the resources required to conduct another lengthy trialand the current demands on the office because of othercriminal prosecutions.   Neither Mr. Mulheren nor his attorney could be reached forcomment.   ---   LEONA HELMSLEY WILL demand a new trial, citing tax audit.   Alan Dershowitz, her attorney, said at a news conferencein New York that he would make the request primarily becausethe Internal Revenue Service has not yet completed an auditof Mrs. Helmsley's tax returns for the years 1981 through1988.   The IRS recently informed Mrs. Helmsley and her husbandHarry that their audit would not be completed until 1995,rather than in 1991 as originally planned, Mr. Dershowitzsaid.   Mrs. Helmsley, the 71-year-old head of the couple's hotelempire, was convicted in August 1989 of mail fraud, filingfalse tax returns and tax evasion for the years 1983 through1985. In December 1989, she was sentenced to four years inprison and fined $7.2 million. And last July a federalappeals court upheld her conviction.   But Mr. Dershowitz claims it's unjust for Mrs. Helmsley toserve any prison time when an IRS audit may eventually clearher of charges that she underpaid her taxes.   The government claims the Helmsleys wrote off personalexpenses as legitimate business expenses and thus reducedtheir personal taxes and the taxes paid by their companies.But Mr. Dershowitz claims they overpaid their taxes by$800,000.   &quot;This is Alice in Wonderland justice,&quot; said Mr. Dershowitzin an interview. &quot;Sentence first, trial to come; prisonfirst, audit to come . . . I don't think the American publicwill stand for putting a woman in jail who hasn't beenaudited.&quot;   Elliott Jacobson, the federal prosecutor in charge of theHelmsley case, said &quot;We don't comment on press conferences .. . And if any post-convictions motions are made, we'llrespond in the appropriate forum, which is the courtroom.&quot;   An IRS spokesman said, &quot;Tax matters are confidential bylaw and we do not comment on them.&quot;   ---   JAPANESE SCHOLAR and U.S. resolve dispute over immigration&quot;lookout list.&quot;   At issue was a U.S. government list of foreign nationalsconsidered possibly dangerous if permitted to enter the U.S.Choichiro Yatani, an American-educated psychologist whosename was on the list, had not left the U.S. for five yearsbecause he feared he would not be allowed to return.   An agreement between the federal government and Dr. Yataniwill allow him to return to his native Japan without fear ofbeing detained by immigration authorities upon re-entry tothe U.S., his attorney said. Dr. Yatani has accepted ateaching position at the State University of New York collegein Alfred, N.Y.   Dr. Yatani, who had been detained for 44 days in 1986 whenre-entering the U.S., filed suit in January to have his nameremoved from the list, as allowed by the Immigration Act of1990. He was apparently the first person to challenge hislisting under that legislation.   His attorney, Arthur C. Helton, director of the RefugeeProject at the Lawyer's Committee for Human Rights, said thatthe &quot;exercise&quot; in removing Mr. Yatani from the list, on whichhe was included for ideological reasons, could serve asprecedent for others, such as writer Gabriel Garcia Marquezand actor Yves Montand.   In June, the State Department agreed to remove Dr. Yatanifrom its list. Under a stipulation submitted yesterday tofederal Judge John E. Sprizzo in Manhattan, attorneys for thescholar and the U.S. agreed that Dr. Yatani's name will alsobe removed from the Immigration and Naturalization Service'slookout list and any other similar government list.   ---   FORMER JUSTICE AGENCY AIDE joins office of New York lawfirm.
