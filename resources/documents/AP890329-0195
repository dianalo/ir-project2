MEARS</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The good news, according to the million-dollarcampaign manager, is that Republicans are at rock-bottom strengthwith the 174 House seats the party now holds. In the era of nearlyinvincible incumbents, that also is their bad news.   While that means Republican strength probably won't go muchlower, it also means the odds are prohibitive against any swiftcomeback from 34 years without a House majority.   Ed Rollins, who was a White House political adviser to RonaldReagan and managed his landslide re-election campaign in 1984, isthe man assigned to find the way back. It involves the politicalequivalent of heavy lifting, but it pays well _ $250,000 a year,probably over the next four years.   That price tag was not popular, stirring resentment among someof its presumed beneficiaries, since House members are earning$89,500 and didn't dare to vote themselves a raise this year.   Rollins is the new co-chairman of the National RepublicanCongressional Committee, the party's House campaign organization.He says his goal is to make Republicans competitive for the 218seats that make up a House majority, which they haven't had sincethe 1954 elections. According to Rollins, that would put the GOP inposition to reclaim the majority in the mid-1990s.   They start at what Rollins calls a low point, 174 out of 435seats. That's down from 192 after Ronald Reagan's election in 1980.Rollins figures there are 160 safe GOP seats, in districts sosecurely Republican that they'd stay that way even if the nationalcampaign organization shut down and did nothing to help.   But seats that look safe come with no guarantees, asdemonstrated Tuesday when the Republicans lost the Indiana Houseseat once held by Vice President Dan Quayle. Democrat Jill Longtook over a seat that had been Republican since 1976. That givesthe Democrats 259 House seats, with two vacancies awaiting specialelections.   Republicans are trying return the favor next week in Alabama,where a special election will fill the seat left vacant by thedeath of Rep. Bill Nichols, the longtime Democratic incumbent.   That overall margin probably insulates the Republicans againstsignificant House losses in 1990. The party holding the White Houseusually has suffered House setbacks in mid-term elections, becausethe president's party normally gained swing seats on his coattailsin the previous election. But President Bush had no such coattails_ the GOP lost three House seats in 1988.   So there is no realignment pending in 1990, in either direction.But the sheer size of the Democratic margin and the better than 9out of 10 liklihood that an incumbent will be re-elected confrontRollins and the Republicans with a mountain to be scaled on the wayto anything approaching House control.   Rollins already has started Republican groundwork for thereapportionment that will follow the 1990 census, which is expectedto shift 18 House seats out of the Northeast and parts of theMidwest, most of them to the southern and southwestern states thathave become Republican territory.   But there will be redistricting to reflect population shiftseven in states that do not lose or gain seats. Rollins saysRepublicans will have the technical and legal know-how, and thepolitical message to take advantage of the changes.   There's no way to guess the outcome, but the last time areapportioned House was elected along with a president, in 1972,Republicans won nearly two-thirds of the open seats.   Rollins talks of emerging from the next two elections with netGOP gains of 30 seats, saying that would put a re-elected PresidentBush within range of a House majority for administration programsduring a second term. He said it would be a philosophical majority,like the coalition of Republicans and conservative Democrats thatgave Reagan his early House victories.   If Rollins can deliver that kind of progress, he'll not onlyearn his money, he probably should put in for a bonus.   He advocates a strategy based on confrontation rather thancompromise, telling reporters that Republican House leaders alwaysshould think in campaign terms. ``We are in combat,'' he says. Thathard line fits the style of Republican National Chairman LeeAtwater and Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia, newly-elected as the No.2 man in the minority leadership.   It doesn't mesh with President Bush's ideas about bipartisanshipin administration dealings with the Democratic Congress. ButRollins doesn't argue; he says whatever works to keep the presidentpopular works to the advantage of GOP candidates.   Rollins says confrontation be part of a two-track strategy, withRepublicans going after Democrats back home in their Housedistricts even while the Bush administration seeks bipartisansupport for its proposals in Washington.   But when Bush needs Democratic votes there is going to have tobe some political bargaining.   And if that leads to a call from the White House asking GOPpolitical operators to lay off Democrats who may side with theadministration?   ``I hope Mr. Atwater is the one who gets that call,'' saidRollins.</TEXT><TEXT>   EDITOR'S NOTE: Walter R.
