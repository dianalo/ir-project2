How times change. The fourth-largest U.S. buy-out turnedout to be a resounding success. The Nashville, Tenn.,hospital operator next month will be joining the stockmarket's new-issue boom: It plans to sell 34 million newshares for $19 to $22 apiece, or as much as $748 million.</LP><TEXT>   The price could well rise after the offering, analystsagreed. But they question whether people who invest todaywill do nearly as well as the buy-out investors.   &quot;You might argue that the easy money has been made,&quot; saysSalomon Brothers' health-care analyst Margo Vignola. Thoughthe company has scored some gains by shifting toward thefaster-growing area of outpatient care, &quot;it's coming publicat a time when the dynamics of the industry aren't veryencouraging.&quot;   The average proposed price is more than eight times thatpaid by a group of insiders -- led by Chairman Thomas F.Frist Jr. -- who put up $300 million in equity. That groupincludes two blue-chip Wall Street firms, Goldman Sachs andJ.P. Morgan, as well as the Rockefeller family and Texasinvestor Richard Rainwater.   For Mr. Rainwater, the Hospital Corp. deal is the biggesthome-run investment since he parted company in 1986 with theBass Brothers, whom he had served as chief investmentstrategist. Since then, he has tripled his own investmentportfolio, from about $120 million to $360 million. A grouphe leads paid $29.5 million for Hospital Corp. stock thatwould be worth nearly $242 million at the midpoint of theproposed price range.   Today, prospective new investors are facing the samequestions that haunted the buy-out group: uncertainties aboutthe profit prospects of health care, and to a lesser degree,the company's debt.   Analysts say the Hospital Corp. buy-out succeeded becauseMr. Frist stopped spending money for expansion to suchfarflung locales as Brazil, Singapore and Australia, and gotserious about selling assets and cutting costs. The icing onthe cake was lower interest rates and a soaring stock market.   &quot;HCA's focus for years was on expansion, building big size-- and they didn't raise rates when they could have,&quot; saysSalomon's Ms. Vignola. As a result, she says, &quot;when they wentprivate, there was a lot of fat that could be cut.&quot;   By selling off many rural and small suburban hospitals,the company was able to &quot;really focus on expenses in a waythey hadn't done before,&quot; says junk-bond analyst MeredithAdler of First Boston Corp. Also helpful, says Edward Mally,Salomon's director of high-yield research, was the ampleprice Hospital Corp. received from selling a 50% stake in ahealth maintenance organization for $370 million.   But some analysts warn that the profit growth generated bycost-cutting and deleveraging isn't sustainable. And newuncertainties loom, some disclosed for the first time in aHospital Corp. stock-sale filing dated Jan. 3.   For example, the filing says the Internal Revenue Serviceis challenging Hospital Corp. for $1.1 billion in back taxesand interest. The IRS is disputing Hospital Corp.'saccounting for income, acquisitions, insurance and assetsales. While analysts aren't too worried about the outcome ofthe case, the number is large enough to frighten someinvestors.   Hospital Corp. also has an Achilles' heel of sorts in itspsychiatric hospital business, which contributes 12% ofHospital Corp.'s cash flow. The length of average stays inpsychiatric hospitals is declining, and Hospital Corp. triedunsuccessfully to sell the business after the buy-out.   Texas regulators are investigating a competing chain ofpsychiatric hospitals for alleged improper recruiting ofpatients. And on Nov. 22, the state's attorney general saidthe probe had expanded to include hospitals operated by othercompanies, including Hospital Corp. In an effort to assuageinvestor concerns, the filing says &quot;the company believes thatthe Attorney General is not currently contemplating theinstitution of litigation against the company and its Texaspsychiatric subsidiaries.&quot;   Some analysts believe the Hospital Corp. offering will gowell because concerns about the health-care business haveeased.   George Pillari, president of Health Care InvestmentAnalysts Inc. in Baltimore, says that in the late 1980s,investors were &quot;very apprehensive about anything to do withhospitals.&quot; Now, he says, they &quot;recognize that there are somecompanies out there, like Hospital Corp., which have selecteda strong group of hospitals, have managed them carefully, andare on a firm footing.&quot;   Investors may be readier to swallow Hospital Corp. stockafter a recent successful offering by HealthTrust Inc., agroup of 104 hospitals that Hospital Corp. sold in 1987.HealthTrust shares came public Dec. 20 at 14, just before thestock market took off. They got as high as 22 1/4, and lateyesterday were trading at 20 7/8, off 3/4.   Analysts expect Hospital Corp. to trade somewhere between12 and 15 times expected 1992 earnings -- about where otherhospital companies trade, but a discount to the market as awhole. The reason for the discount: slow-growth prospects forhealth care.   Because the underwriters haven't begun briefing analystsand money managers, most analysts don't have Hospital Corp.earnings estimates. One who made a rough estimate expectsHospital Corp. net income to grow to $1.70 a share in 1992from $1.45 in 1991 -- implying a stock price of roughly $20to $25 a share.   Some analysts believe Hospital Corp. stock is likely totrade upward from its offering price because Goldman and J.P.Morgan are two of the three lead underwriters; both haveequity stakes, giving them reason to make doubly sure theoffering goes well. The other lead underwriter is MerrillLynch.   The stock-sale proceeds will be used to repay subordinateddebt and bank debt; no current stockholders are sellingshares in this offering. Hospital Corp. will have 147.5million shares outstanding after the sale, not countingoptions on 33.7 million shares held mainly by employees.   Even after the offering, Hospital Corp. will have $3.03billion of debt, a steep 80% of total capital. But WallStreet's attitudes have changed, at least for now. &quot;Thehospital business lends itself well to leverage,&quot; says ToddRichter of Dean Witter Reynolds. &quot;It's a stable, predictablebusiness that's not greatly affected by economic variables.&quot;   ---                       How HCA Has Done                                                                                                                                               NINE-MONTH RESULTS*                                         1991         1990                                                                                                        Revenue (billions)                     $3.75        $3.47 Interest expense (millions)           $367.5       $438.9 Net Income                             $96.8        $67.1 Per-share net**                        $0.97         N.A.                                                                                                          *Results for nine months ended Sept. 30   **Fully diluted, pro forma, as if pending stock offeringhad occurred Jan. 1, 1990.
