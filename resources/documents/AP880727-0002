Hundreds of locomotive drivers and assistants demanding higherpay and shorter hours walked off the job Tuesday after refusing toaccept a compromise deal on allowances and working hours.   The Korean National Railroad said services were operating atabout 30 percent of normal levels after being virtually crippledTuesday. Railroad officials said they hoped to restore almost fullservice by Thursday as strikers returned to work.   Surburban train service around Seoul, which was affected by thestrike, was back to normal early Wednesday, railroad officials said.   Police officials, who declined to be named, said 420 people werestill being held Wednesday after about 1,460 striking drivers andmembers of their families were arrested the day before for blockingstations and other railroad facilities. The others had beenreleased with reprimands, police said.   Of the ramaining 420 still in custody, officials said about 20were strike leaders facing charges of conducting an illegal strike.The others would probably be handed over to summary courts to faceminor charges, they said.   The government moved to crush the strike and thousands of riotpolice were sent to stations and railway yards to stop peacefulprotests by the strikers and their families. The Cabinet held anemergency session Tuesday to oversee handling of the affair.   Those arrested defied police orders to disperse, but there wereno reports of violent clashes, police said.   Railroad officials said strikers were returning to work, butthey had no overall figures on how many of the some 4,400 driversand assistants had joined the strike. They said they expect moststrikers to resume work Wednesday.   But reports in Seoul newspapers Wednesday said some strikerssaid they would not return to work until all strikers arrested bypolice had been freed.   The officials said the strike cost the KNR an estimated $2.5million Tuesday alone and that there was no estimate yet as tolosses suffered by other industries.   Choi Ki-duk, head of the railroad authority, said the strike wasillegal because it had not been approved by the railroad union.   Strikers said a compromise deal worked out by the union failedto satisfy demands for shorter work hours and a 100 percent raisein allowances paid on top of normal salaries.   Under the rejected deal, the railroad would raise allowancesfrom about $100 to $138 a month and cut workloads from 245 hours to224 hours a month. The strikers wanted work hours cut to 144 hours.   South Korea's train drivers with about 10 years's expereinceearn about $1,200 a month in regular salary and various allowances,which include overtime, holiday allowance, locomotive driversallowance, according to the railroad.</TEXT></DOC>
