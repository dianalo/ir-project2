L. 97-424, 96 Stat. 2097,2157-58, enacted January 6, 1983 (49 U.S.C. app. 2301 <T3>et seq.</T3>), provides protection to employees in the trucking industryfrom discrimination because of activity related to commercial motor vehiclesafety and health matters. On November 21, 1986, OSHA published an interimfinal rule which provided for rules of practice and procedure to implementsection 405 of STAA. At that time the agency requested comments concerningthe interim final rules. Since then, the agency has received several commentsfrom interested parties and the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled on an importantprovision in STAA. OSHA has reviewed those comments and the Court's decisionand it now adopts these rules which have been revised to a certain extentto comply with the Court's ruling on the statute and its method of implementationand to address problems perceived by the agency or the commentators.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>These rules are effective December 27, 1988.

In addition to promulgatingthe interim final rule, OSHA's notice included a request for public commenton the interim rules. In response, five organizations and individuals filed comments with theagency. These commentators represented the full spectrum of those who willbe affected by the rules. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters, alabor organization representing a significant portion of drivers coveredby STAA, filed a comment which supported the rules as drafted. Two truckingindustry associations, American Trucking Association Inc. (ATA) and SpecializedCarriers and Rigging Association (SCRA), filed comments, which generallysupported the rule but also pointed to specific problems which they perceivedin the rules. In addition, two attorneys, Michael C. Towers of Fisher andPhillips, Atlanta, Georgia, and Jeffrey I. Pasek of Cohen, Shapiro, Polisher,Shiekman and Cohen, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, who have participated insection 405 proceedings, filed comments which address both specific problemsthey faced under practice prior to rule promulgation and also problemsthat they perceive under the interim rule. After promulgation of the interim rule, in <T3>Brock </T3>v. <T3>Roadway Express, Inc., </T3>_ U.S. _, 107 S. Ct. 1740 (1987), the SupremeCourt ruled on a constitutional challenge to the temporary reinstatementprovision in STAA. (49 U.S.C. app. 2305(c)(2)(A)). The Supreme Court'sruling, which upheld the constitutionality of that statutory provisionand the rules promulgated thereunder, directly affected several of therules and accordingly, OSHA has decided to redraft certain subsectionsof the rule to better comport with the Supreme Court's holding.Following the receipt of the comments and the issuance of the decisionin <T3>Brock </T3>v. <T3>Roadway Express, Inc., </T3><T3>id. (</T3>hereinafter <T3>``Roadway Express''</T3>), OSHA has reviewed the comments and the decisionand, in response, has developed a final rule which makes some changes inthe interim final rule. Other changes urged by commentators were consideredbut rejected. OSHA addresses the comments and the changes in the discussionwhich follows. The comments and OSHA's response are discussed seriatimin the order of the provisions of the rule. <ITAG tagnum="84">Definitions</ITAG>OSHA received only one comment on the definition section. SCRA questionedwhether the meaning of ``employee'' as defined in andSection; 1978.101(d)included the employee of an independent contractor. OSHA believes that a person is an employee, whether he or she works fora major multistate trucking firm or for an independent contractor, if thatperson meets the criteria found in 49 U.S.C. 2301, <T3>i.e., </T3>if that person drives in interstate commerce a vehicle whichmeets the criteria of the definition of ``commercial motor vehicle'' foundat 49 U.S.C. app. 2301(1) and is employed by a commercial motor carrieras that term is defined in a new definition in the regulation at andSection;1978.101(e). For example, if an independent contractor is a motor carrierand has an employee who drives a vehicle in interstate commerce which hasa gross vehicle weight rating of ten thousand or more pounds, that employeeis covered by section 405. Because the statute and rule did not previouslyprovide a definition for ``commercial motor carrier,'' OSHA has added adefinition at andSection; 1978.101(e). OSHA also notes that the definition of ``employee'' specifically includesan independent contractor if that person personally operates the commercialmotor vehicle in interstate commerce. In that instance, if the independentcontractor insisted upon meeting DOT regulations and subsequently the companywhich had contracted with him refused to honor the contract because ofthe independent contractor's safety activity, the independent contractorhas the right to complain to OSHA about such adverse action. <ITAG tagnum="84">Filing of Complaint</ITAG>SCRA has suggested that andSection; 1978.102(c) be changed because the rulepermits the filing of section 405 cases with ``any OSHA officer or employee,''with the result that the employer would have to travel to a remote locationto contest the filing. This comment misapprehends OSHA practice and theintent of the rule. Section 1978.102(c) simply permits the employee tofile at a convenient location. Thereafter, OSHA will assign the case toa regional office responsible for enforcement activities in the geographicalarea where the employee resides or was employed. Usually, this locationis equally convenient to the employer, since most employees are domicilednear the terminal which may have discriminated against them. Thus, OSHAdoes not see this rule, which permits quick and convenient filing of acomplaint, to impinge unduly upon employer or employee. In andSection;1978.102(f), OSHA has made a change in accordance with <T3>Roadway Express</T3> and several comments. The interim rule calledfor OSHA to notify the <T3>``named person'' i.e., </T3>the person against whom the complaint hadbeen filed, of the filing of a complaint without transmittal of the actualcomplaint filed by the employee. Several commentators suggested that thiswithholding of the actual complaint is unfair. Likewise, the Supreme Courthas suggested that the named person be given notice of the complaint andthe substance of the relevant evidence to satisfy due process requirements.<T3>Roadway Express</T3>, 107 S. Ct. at 1748. Accordingly, OSHA has changed102(f) to provide that, upon receipt of a valid section 405 complaint,the agency will transmit to the named person a copy of the complaint asfiled by the complainant, as long as the complaint does not identify anypotential confidential witnesses.   Nevertheless, OSHA notes that often-times the complaint as received fromthe employee is frequently an inarticulate, non-legal statement of thefacts as a non-lawyer perceives them. After receipt and transmittal ofthe complaint, when OSHA conducts its investigation, the agency may discoverevidence which expands or narrows the basis and the scope of the complaint'sallegation. See <T3>NLRB </T3>v. <T3>Indiana andamp; Michigan Electric Co., </T3>318 U.S. 9, 18 (1942). Ofcourse, as provided for in the new andSection;1978.103(b) (discussed below),if the nature or scope of the investigation changes, OSHA shall notifythe named person of any new or additional bases for the claim of discrimination.<ITAG tagnum="84">Investigation  </ITAG>In response to <T3>Roadway Express</T3> and several comments, OSHA has significantly revampedandSection;1978.103(b). In <T3>Roadway Express</T3>, the Court upheld the facial constitutionalityof the statute and the regulations under the Due Process clause of theFifth Amendment and thus ruled that the statute's provision permittingtemporary reinstatement of a discharged employee after a preliminary investigationand issuance of findings and order was permissible. However, in the Court'sanalysis of the facts, because the record failed to show that OSHA investigatorshad informed Roadway of the substance of the evidence to support reinstatementof the discharged employee, the plurality concluded that the statute andOSHA's rules were unconstitutionally applied.   Under OSHA's reading of this decision, it has been determined that, whileOSHA's current procedures are facially constitutional, the rule governingthe investigation process should be changed to permit a more clear-cutand orderly exchange of information at the investigative phase. Thus, asnoted above, OSHA will provide to the named person a copy of the employeecomplaint. Additionally, OSHA has changed andSection;1978.103(b) to providefor the named person's apprisal of any new or amended charges which mayhave been discovered during the course of the investigation, and OSHA hasalso added a new section, andSection;1978.103(c), which provides for givingthe named person notice of the substance of the evidence which supportsthe complaint, if OSHA has reason to believe that it may be necessary toorder temporary reinstatement of the complainant. In addition to providingthe named person with the substance of the relevant evidence supportinga finding of discrimination and temporary reinstatement, andSection;1978.103(c)provides the named person the opportunity to meet with the investigatorto submit rebuttal evidence.  When OSHA provides the named person with notice of the substance of therelevant supporting evidence, OSHA shall provide the named person witha synopsis of the evidence and may provide sanitized witness statements.However, OSHA will not provide the names of the witnesses and, if the statementscannot be sanitized to the extent that the identity of the witnesses isprotected, OSHA will not provide the written statements themselves, butinstead it will provide the company with the substance of the evidence. This decision to withhold names and copies of statements has been madein conformity with the Department of Labor's longstanding practice of protectingthe identity of confidential witnesses. See, <T3>e.g. Stephenson Enterprises Inc. </T3>v. <T3>Marshall, </T3>578 F.2d 1021, 1025 (5th Cir. 1978); <T3>Hodgson </T3>v. <T3>Charles Martin Inspectors of Petroleum Inc., </T3>459 F.2d 303 (5thCir. 1972). See also <T3>Roviaro </T3>v. <T3>U.S., </T3>353 U.S. 53 (1957). OSHA takes statements from witnesseswith the promise that witness identity will not be disclosed unless anduntil a witness is called to testify at trial. This decision to withholdnames is a commonsense approach to a particularly difficult problem. Thegovernment is investigating in these cases because an employee has accusedan employer of discrimination after the employee contacted or threatenedto contact the government. Fellow employees, who are often the best sourcesof information concerning the allegation of discrimination, are unlikelyto come forward with the correct information if they perceive that theemployer will learn of their identity, particularly in cases such as thesewhere the employer is accused of discriminating against employees who contactthe government. Any premature disclosure of witness identities at an earlystage prior to hearing will likely hinder an effective investigation. OSHA's analysis of <T3>Roadway Express</T3>, leads to the conclusion that the Court did notrequire disclosure of the names of confidential witnesses. Indeed, OSHAhas concluded that the plurality's holding supports OSHA's decision. Theplurality held that the minimum that due process requires is notice ofthe employee's allegations, ``notice of the substance of the relevant supportingevidence'' and the opportunity to rebut that evidence in writing and inmeetings with OSHA. 107 S. Ct. 1748. At no point in the plurality decisiondoes the court require OSHA to provide the names or identities of the witnesses.In fact, in three separate places in the plurality opinion, the court distinguishesbetween the term ``substance of the evidence'' and a witness' statement.Additionally, OSHA notes that Justice Brennan also discusses OSHA's obligationin terms of provision of the substance of evidence as opposed to furnishingactual witness statements. Accordingly, under the new rule at andSection;1978.103(c),OSHA will not disclose to the named person the identities of confidentialwitnesses.   However, recognizing that the employer has a constitutional right to knowthe substance of the relevant evidence supporting OSHA's preliminary finding,OSHA, as it has in the past, will disclose to the employer the substanceof the evidence by meeting with the named person to discuss the evidence,and to provide sanitized copies of witness statements, if such provisionwill not jeopardize the identity of witnesses. If there is no way to sanitizethe statements, OSHA will discuss with the employer the substance of therelevant evidence contained in those statements without providing the actualstatements.  During or after the disclosure meeting, the named person may furnish rebuttalevidence. However, due to the Congressional mandate that section 405 proceedingsbe conducted expeditiously, OSHA cannot permit a named person any morethan five days after notification to present rebuttal evidence, unlessthe interests of justice so require. After OSHA has considered the rebuttalevidence, it will issue findings and, if necessary, a preliminary order.<ITAG tagnum="84">Issuance of Findings and the Preliminary Order   </ITAG>OSHA received several comments from the trade associations regarding theaward of attorney's fees to the complainant if complainant prevails. SCRArequested that andSection;1978.104 be redrafted to permit award of attorney'sfees to the named person if he or she prevailed. However, neither the statutenor the legislative history permit an interpretation of the statutory languageto provide award of attorney's fees to the named person. The statutorylanguage specifies that the Secretary may award attorney's fees only toa complainant if he or she prevails. There is no mention of award of attorney'sfees to any other party. Relying on the fundamental canon of construction,<T3>expressio unius est exclusio alterius, </T3>OSHA has concluded that,since Congress mentioned only the complainant in the statutory provisionregarding fees, Congress must have intended to exclude an award of attorney'sfees to the named person. Thus, OSHA is unable to agree with SCRA's comment.Moreover, OSHA notes that the Secretary has already addressed this questionin <T3>Abrams </T3>v. <T3/><T3>Roadway Express, Inc., </T3>84-STA-2, May 23, 1985, wherein the Secretaryconcluded that the statute did not authorize the award of fees to an employer.  In connection with andSection;1978.104, which provides for OSHA's issuanceof findings and a preliminary order which may award attorney's fees, amongother things, ATA commented that the rule as it relates to andSection;1978.109is ambiguous with regard to an employer's liability for attorney's fees.ATA states that andSection;1978.109 does not provide specifically for vacationof a preliminary order by OSHA which awarded attorney's fees and accordingly,it believes that a named person may incur some liability for OSHA's preliminaryorder award of fees. However, OSHA notes in response that andSection;1978.109(c)(4)specifically states that when the Secretary determines that the named persondid not violate the Act, ``the final order shall deny the complaint.''The Secretary's order is the final order of the Department and it takesprecedence over all previous orders and rulings. Consequently, if the Secretaryfinds no validity to an employee's complaint, there can be no basis onwhich to award any damages to complainant, including attorney's fees. Attorney Towers commented that andSection;1978.104(a) should provide fordetailed findings of fact by OSHA at the conclusion of its investigation.OSHA agrees that its findings should be sufficiently detailed as to apprisethe parties of the complained of activity and the facts upon which OSHAhas based its determination regarding whether a violation of the statuteoccurred. However, OSHA believes that it is not necessary to specify inits rule the elements which must be found in each finding of fact issuedby OSHA. The amount of detail and explanation in the findings depends onthe facts of each case. Accordingly, OSHA will not revise andSection;1978.104to specify the amount of detail in its investigative findings.<ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of Rules, Notice of Hearing; Litigation Complaint  </ITAG>Attorney Pasek commented on andSection;1978.106(d); he believed that therule should provide for the filing of a litigation complaint to frame theissues for trial. OSHA has determined for several reasons that this wouldbe an unnecessary step and has chosen not to implement such a rule. First,the findings of fact issued by OSHA in most circumstances should be sufficientlydetailed to apprise the parties of the legal and factual issues presentedin the matter. Moreover, a requirement that the prosecuting party filea litigation complaint after issuance of findings and the filing of objectionsthereto would only tend to delay the proceedings which are to be conductedin a very time-shortened process. The Congressional mandate is that theDepartment is to conduct hearings expeditiously after the filing of objections.Given that the findings and objections have already served to narrow theissues and given the need for an expeditiously conducted hearing, OSHAhas decided that the current rule at andSection;1978.106(d) which providesfor the filing of a prehearing statement of positions, if ordered by thejudge, is sufficient to give the parties notice of the issues and the remedysought.<ITAG tagnum="84">Parties  </ITAG>Section 1978.107 generated a number of comments regarding the role of theAssistant Secretary in administrative hearings. Section 1978.107(a) providesthat if the Assistant Secretary finds reasonable cause to believe the employee'scomplaint, the Assistant Secretary will ordinarily be the prosecuting partyat any administrative hearing conducted pursuant to andSection;1978.106.Section 1978.107(b) provides that if no merit to the employee's complaintis found at the investigative level, the Assistant Secretary will ordinarilynot participate in the hearing.  SCRA and ATA commented that this rule is unfair in that it does not permitthe Assistant Secretary to provide assistance to the employer when OSHAhas found no merit to the employee's complaint. SCRA has proposed that,to remedy this unfairness, OSHA set up a ``public defender'' office whichwill defend the employer's actions in cases arising under andSection;1978.107(b).Similarly, ATA and Attorney Towers believed that OSHA should participatein the hearings even when the agency has found no merit to the complaint. OSHA has carefully considered these comments and finds that the commentatorshave misunderstood the purpose of the statute and the manner in which therules implement the statute. The purpose of the statute is to ensure thatthe government's channels of information are not dried up by employer intimidationof prospective complainants and witnesses. <T3>Brock </T3>v. <T3>Roadway Express, Inc., supra, </T3>107 S. Ct. 1745. See also, <T3>NLRB </T3>v. <T3>Scrivener, </T3>405 U.S. 117, 122 (1972); <T3>Mitchell </T3>v. <T3>Robert De Mario Jewelery, Inc., </T3>361 U.S. 288, 292; <T3>Square D. Company </T3>v. <T3>Donovan, </T3>709 F.2d 335, (5th Cir. 1983) (long-term effect and primarypurpose of antiretaliation suits is to promote effective enforcement ofstatutes by protecting employee communications with governmental authorities.)As Congress noted in the legislative history to STAA:<ITAG tagnum="21">the Section was considered necessary to encourage ``whistle-blowing''by employees. Enforcement of commercial motor vehicle safety laws and regulationsis possible only through an effort on the part of the employer, employees,State safety agencies, and the Department of Transportation. Therefore,the committee considered it necessary to specifically provide protectionfor those employees who are discharged or discriminated against for exercisingtheir rights and responsibilities under this title.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Senate Commerce Committee Section by Section Analysis of Title IV,S. 3044, Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety, 97th Cong., 2d Sess., 128 Cong.Rec. S 14028 (Dec. 7, 1982).  Based on this reasoning, OSHA has found that it is extremely importantthat, if the Assistant Secretary determines that section 405 has been violated,the case be properly prosecuted at a hearing to ensure that the government'schannels of communication with employees are kept open. Accordingly, theSolicitor will normally prosecute this type of claim.  On the other hand, if after an investigation OSHA does not find reasonablecause to believe the employee's complaint, in essence OSHA does not believethat the government's channels of information have been interfered withand accordingly, the government's interest in protecting whistleblowingis not as likely to be implicated in a hearing. For that reason, OSHA willordinarily not participate in such a hearing.  ATA and SCRA urge that this position is unfair in that it denies the namedperson the benefit of the government's investigative report and expertise.However, a requirement that OSHA appear to defend its investigative findingsdoes not further any governmental purpose, for the government has preliminarily,at least, concluded that whistleblowing is not implicated in the hearing,and appearance at a hearing would use up scarce resources.  Furthermore, the hearing is conducted <T3>de novo </T3>and is not a review of OSHA's findings. OSHA's conclusionsare no longer directly at issue. Instead the critical factors at the hearingare the evidence adduced by the complainant as prosecuting party and theemployer's rebuttal of that evidence. Since the employer knows the truereasons for the employment action and can best adduce facts to supportits reasons for taking that action, the party in the best position to refutethe complainant's evidence is the named person. The Assistant Secretarywill not have any special knowledge of the employer's reasons for the dischargeor other action and thus, would not likely be able to contribute to theproceeding.In a related comment, Attorney Towers raises a constitutional objectionto andSection;1978.107(b) which, as noted, provides that if the AssistantSecretary does not find reasonable cause to believe that the employee'scomplaint has merit, he or she will ordinarily not participate in the administrativehearing which may be held after the employee files objections. Mr. Towers'objection is based on the proposition that, if the Assistant Secretarydoes not participate in the hearing, the complainant then seeks to remedya private dispute in an administrative tribunal, which is an Article Iof the U.S. Constitution tribunal. Under Mr. Towers' argument, privatedisputes can be constitutionally adjudicated only in Article III courts.See <T3>Northern Pipeline Co. </T3>v. <T3>Marathon Pipeline Co., </T3>458 U.S. 50 (1982) (Bankruptcy Act of 1978is unconstitutional to the extent bankruptcy judges were not Article IIIjudges.)OSHA believes that his objection is based on an erroneous assumption. Theobjection assumes that when the Assistant Secretary finds no reasonablecause to believe the employee's claim, the matter becomes a purely privatedispute if it goes to an administrative hearing without the Assistant Secretary'sparticipation. On the contrary, with or without the Assistant Secretary'sparticipation, the employee's claim is still very much a claim that a Congressionallycreated right to be protected from discrimination has been violated. Anemployee's claim of discrimination based on engagement in the protectedactivity of ``whistleblowing'' with regard to commercial motor vehiclesafety and health matters is a claim which did not exist at common law.It only came into existence when Congress, on January 6, 1983, determinedthat the government had to protect its sources of information and accordingly,the STAA process was formulated. In this regard, then, OSHA's investigativefinding is merely the first step in a Congressionally-created process todetermine whether the claim is correct. The <T3>de novo </T3>hearing before an administrative law judge, followed bythe Secretary of Labor's review are additional steps in this process andin no way are they resolution of ``private disputes''. Since these areall steps in a Department of Labor process to determine the existence ofa statutory violation, the Assistant Secretary's non-participation in theproceeding does not render the Congressionally-created right a privatedispute.Indeed, as explained in various Supreme Court decisions, when Congresshas created a special right, not known at common law, such as the rightto be free from discrimination because of an employee's safety-relatedactivities, Congress can remove adjudication of this Congressionally-createdsubstantive Federal right from Article III courts and delegate it to administrativeagencies for factual determination. See <T3>Northern Pipeline Construction Co. </T3>v. <T3>Marathon Pipeline Co., </T3>458 U.S. 50, 102 S. Ct. 2858, 2878. Seealso, <T3>Crowell </T3>v. <T3>Benson, </T3>285 U.S. 22, 51-65 (1932); <T3>Atlas Roofing Co. </T3>v. <T3>OSHRC, </T3>430 U.S. 442, 450 n. 7 (1977); <T3>NLRB </T3>v. <T3>Jones andamp; Laughlin Steel Corp., </T3>301 U.S. 1, (1937). In fact,Congress has used the same or similar approaches in numerous other whistleblowerstatutes administered by the Secretary. See, e.g., Energy ReorganizationAct, 42 U.S.C. 5851; Toxic Substances Control Act, 15 U.S.C. 2622; SafeWater Drinking Act, 42 U.S.C. 300; 9(i); Water Pollution Control Act, 33U.S.C. 1367; Solid Waste Disposal Act, 42 U.S.C. 6971; Clean Air Act, 42U.S.C. 7622; Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and LiabilityAct, 42 U.S.C. 9610; and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, 42 U.S.C.6971.Finally, OSHA notes that the final administrative decision of the Secretaryis reviewable in the Federal courts of appeals, 49 U.S.C. app. 2305(d)(1),and the Secretary must go to U.S. district court to enforce his final order.49 U.S.C. app. 2305(e).Two other comments were raised with regard to andSection;1978.107. AttorneyPasek noted that this section contains the only direct reference to theright of the parties to obtain discovery in STAA proceedings and he requestedthat the rules provide more explicitly for discovery. The rule does notprovide for specific discovery measures because the rule in andSection;1978.106(a),has incorporated by reference 29 CFR Part 18, the Rules of Procedure governingDepartment of Labor Administrative Hearings, which specifically providesfor discovery. See 29 CFR 18.14-23.Attorney Towers also noted that the rule did not provide for joinder ofnecessary parties. OSHA believes that it is unnecessary to have a specificprovision regarding joinder because 29 CFR Part 18 specifies that the FederalRules of Civil Procedure will apply to the extent that the rules of administrativepractice do not cover an area.<ITAG tagnum="84">Decision and Orders</ITAG>Section 1978.109, which covers the issuance of ALJ decisions and the finaldecision and order of the Secretary, generated several comments. As notedpreviously in OSHA's response to comments on andSection;1978.104, SCRA andATA commented on the availability of attorney's fees for employers. Asnoted in the response to those comments, the statute provides only forawards of costs and attorney's fees to complainants.Attorney Towers and ATA commented on the andSection;1978.109(a) provisionfor the close of the record before the administrative law judge. Accordingto these commentators, the rule appeared to be incorrectly drafted becauseandSection;1978.106(b) provided for the holding of a hearing within 30 daysof the filing of objections, and yet andSection;1978.109(a) provided forthe closing of the record ``no later than 30 days after the objection.''According to the comments, the rules conflicted and presented the partieswith an impossibility of performance in that the hearing would open onthe same day as the record would close.OSHA has reviewed this provision and believes that the rules as draftedare correct and operable. In andSection;1978.106(b), the hearing must commencewithin 30 days after the filing of an objection to the Assistant Secretary'sfindings and order. This rule means that a hearing can commence at anytime within that 30 day period, unless the parties agree to an extension.In andSection;1978.109(a), the record closes on the 30th day after the filingof objections. This rule requires that any hearing which may have beenconducted and the submission of all evidence must be completed by the closeof business on the 30th day after the filing of objections. In this scenario,there is no conflict between andSection;andSection;1978.106(b) and 1978.109(a)since the hearing could be conducted prior to and concluded by the 30thday after the filing of objections. Accordingly, the record can then beclosed on the 30th day. If necessary, the parties may agree to a continuance.OSHA's purpose in implementing such a shortened timeframe for hearingsis to satisfy the Congressional mandate that hearings be conducted ``expeditiously''after objections are filed. See <T3>Brock </T3>v. <T3>Roadway Express, Inc., supra, </T3>107 U.S. 1746.<ITAG tagnum="84">Withdrawal and Settlements </ITAG>Attorney Pasek raised several concerns regarding andSection; 1978.111. Hisfirst concern is that andSection; 1978.111(a) limits the withdrawal of complaintsby an employee to the time prior to the filing of objections to the AssistantSecretary's findings. Attorney Pasek found this requirement to be ``undulyrestrictive'' and an impairment to reaching an amicable accord. OSHA hasconsidered this concern and believes that he has misunderstood the purposeof this section. Section 1978.111(a) is aimed at the unilateral withdrawalof a complaint by the complainant prior to the start of adjudicatory proceedings.If an individual is no longer interested in pursuing his claim at the <T3>investigative </T3>stage, OSHA will review with the complainant hisor her reasons for withdrawal and, if OSHA determines that this withdrawalhas been made voluntarily and under no coercion by the named person, thewithdrawal request will ordinarily be approved by OSHA. Attorney Pasek also was concerned that andSection; 1978.111(c) unduly restrictedsettlement attempts since the subsection requires the ALJ or the Secretaryto affirm any portion of the findings or order with respect to which objectionis withdrawn. OSHA's purpose in promulgating this rule was to cover unilateralwithdrawals of objections to findings and an order where a party has determinedon his or her own that he or she no longer wishes to pursue an objectionand it is not intended to cover a settlement agreement. The Secretary,in <T3>Underwood </T3>v. <T3>Blue Springs Hatchery, </T3>87-STA-21, Order to Show Cause, issuedSeptember 23, 1987, has also ruled that andSection; 1978.111(c) covers thewithdrawal of complaint after the filing of objections. If the parties,including the Assistant Secretary, agree, a settlement which includes awithdrawal of objections without admitting liability may be reached withoutengaging the provisions in andSection; 1978.111(c). Such a settlement fallsnot under andSection; 1978.111(c) but rather andSection; 1978.111(d), wheresettlements are to be tri-partite as required by the statute. In andSection; 1978.111(d), OSHA intended to require that all parties whohave chosen to participate in the hearing agree to the settlement and thatthe Secretary of Labor approve such agreement. In andSection; 1978.111(d)settlements, if the Assistant Secretary has chosen not to participate inthe hearing, it was OSHA's intent that it should be unnecessary to seekhis approval of the agreement. Instead, the settlement section requiresthat the agreement be submitted for approval by the Secretary or his ALJ.In that regard, the settlement would conform with the statutory mandatethat proceedings under 405 may be terminated by a settlement agreemententered into by the Secretary of Labor, the complainant and the named person.To the extent that andSection; 1978.111(d) does not make this intention clear,OSHA has changed the rule to provide for a distinction between settlementsat the investigative phase and those at the adjudicatory phase. New andSection;1978.111(d)(1) provides for investigative settlements where tri-partiteagreement is reached with the Assistant Secretary's approval of a settlementbetween complainant and the named person. New andSection; 1978.111(d)(2)provides for the procedure in adjudicatory settlements where the parties,including the Assistant Secretary if he or she has elected to participate,must submit the agreement for approval to the ALJ or the Secretary. NewandSection; 1978.111(d)(3) incorporates the language of old andSection; 1978.111(d)which covered the Assistant Secretary's declination to prosecute a caseif the complainant refused to accept a fair and equitable settlement. OSHAbelieves that the new language will clarify its intent in the previouslydrafted section on settlements. <ITAG tagnum="84"> Arbitration or Other Proceedings </ITAG>Attorney Towers and ATA commented that, at the investigative phase priorto issuance of findings and preliminary order, the Assistant Secretaryshould defer to the outcome of other proceedings. OSHA intended that theprovisions at andSection; 1978.112(c) apply to the Assistant Secretary aswell as the Secretary's. OSHA's reading of the current language is thatandSection; 1978.112(c)'s use of the word ``Secretary'' included the AssistantSecretary within its ambit. See andSection; 1978.101(b). However, OSHA recognizedthat confusion may occur as the section is presently drafted and accordingly,to eliminate this confusion, andSection; 1978.112(c) shall be changed toinclude a reference to the Assistant Secretary. Under this provision, theAssistant Secretary, at the investigative phase, may defer to the outcomeof proceedings conducted in another forum, including arbitration and grievanceproceedings, if those proceedings dealt adequately with all factual issues,were fair, regular and free of procedural defects and the outcome of theproceedings was not repugnant to the purpose and policy of the Act. See<T3>Spielberg Mfg. Co., </T3>112 NLRB 1080, 1082 (1955). OSHA has made one other, insignificant change in andSection; 1978.112. Aswas done in andSection; 1978.102(d)(3), OSHA has deleted any case citationswhich support the rule. OSHA has deleted these references since the specificcitations do not add anything significant to the rule and only serve toclutter the text of the subsections. <ITAG tagnum="84">Errata </ITAG>Several errors occurred in promulgation of the interim rule. These errorsare related solely to incorrect cross references within the rule itselfand one instance of incorrect editing. 1.

Therefore,the rule is not classified as a ``major rule'' under Executive Order 12291on Federal Regulations, because it is not likely to result in (1) an annualeffect on the economy of $100 million or more; (2) a major increase incosts or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal, State orlocal government agencies, or geographic regions; or (3) significant adverseeffects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation,or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-basedenterprises in domestic or export markets. Accordingly, no regulatory impactanalysis is required.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>The Department believes that the rule will have no ``significant economicimpact upon a substantial number of small entities'' within the meaningof section 3(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, Pub. L. 96-354, 91 Stat.1164 (5 U.S.C. 605(b)). The Secretary has certified to the Chief Counselfor Advocacy of the Small Business Administration to this effect. Thisconclusion is reached because the rule is procedural in character in thatit implements the procedures established by the Surface TransportationAssistance Act of 1982 and thus no significant economic impact is expectedwith respect to small entities, nor with respect to other entities as well.Accordingly, no regulatory flexibility analysis is required. <ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>This rule is not subject to section 3504(h) of the Paperwork ReductionAct, since it does not contain a collection of information requirement.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 29 CFR Part 1978</ITAG>Employer-employee relations, Administrative practice and procedure, Labor,Occupational Safety and Health.<ITAG tagnum="21">Signed at Washington, DC this 17th day of November, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6"> John A.

(b) Procedures are established by this subpart pursuant to the statutoryprovision set forth above for the expeditious handling of complaints ofdiscrimination made by employees, or persons acting on their behalf. Theserules, together with those rules set forth at 29 CFR Part 18, set forththe procedures for submission of complaints under section 405, investigations,issuance of findings and preliminary orders, objections thereto, litigationbefore administrative law judges, post-hearing administrative review, withdrawalsand settlements, judicial review and enforcement, and deferral to otherforums. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;1978.101 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Definitions. </ITAG>(a) ``Act'' means the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 (STAA)(49 U.S.C. 2301 <T3>et seq.</T3>).

(c) ``Assistant Secretary'' means the Assistant Secretary of Labor forOccupational Safety and Health or the person or persons to whom he or shedelegates authority under the Act. (d) ``Employee'' means (1) a driver of a commercial motor vehicle (includingan independent contractor while in the course of personally operating acommercial motor vehicle); (2) a mechanic; (3) a freight handler; or (4)any individual other than an employer; who is employed by a commercialmotor carrier and who in the course of his employment directly affectscommercial motor vehicle safety, but such term does not include an employeeof the United States, any State, or a political subdivision of a Statewho is acting within the course of such employment.

Addresses and telephone numbers for these officialsare set forth in local directories. (d) <T3>Time for filing. </T3>(1) Section 405(c)(1) provides that an employeewho believes that he has been discriminated against in violation of section405 (a) or (b) ``* * * may, within one hundred and eighty days after suchalleged violation occurs,'' file or have filed by any person on the employee'sbehalf a complaint with the Secretary. (2) A major purpose of the 180-day period in this provision is to allowthe Secretary to decline to entertain complaints which have become stale.Accordingly, complaints not filed within 180 days of an alleged violationwill ordinarily be considered to be untimely. (3) However, there are circumstances which will justify tolling of the180-day period on the basis of recognized equitable principles or becauseof extenuating circumstances, <T3>e.g., </T3>where the employer has concealed or misled the employeeregarding the grounds for discharge or other adverse action; or where thediscrimination is in the nature of a continuing violation. The pendencyof grievance-arbitration proceedings or filing with another agency areexamples of circumstances which do not justify a tolling of the 180-dayperiod. The Assistant Secretary will not ordinarily investigate complaintswhich are determined to be untimely.

Normal procedures for investigationsunder both sections will be followed, except as otherwise provided. (f) Upon receipt of a valid complaint, OSHA shall notify the named personof the filing of the complaint by providing a copy of the complaint, sanitizedto protect witness confidentiality if necessary, and shall also notifythe named person of his or her rights under 29 CFR 1978.103 (b) and (c).<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;1978.103 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">investigation. </ITAG>(a) OSHA shall investigate and gather data concerning the case as it deemsappropriate. (b) Within twenty days of his or her receipt of the complaint the namedperson may submit to OSHA a written statement and any affidavits or documentsexplaining or defending his or her position. Within the same twenty daysthe named person may request a meeting with OSHA to present his or herposition. The meeting will be held before the issuance of any findingsor preliminary order. At the meeting the named person may be accompaniedby counsel and by any persons with information relating to the complaint,who may make statements concerning the case. At such meeting OSHA may presentadditional allegations of violations which may have been discovered inthe course of its investigation. (c) If, on the basis of information gathered under paragraphs (a) and (b)of this section, OSHA has reasonable cause to believe that the named personhas violated the Act and that temporary reinstatement is warranted, priorto the issuance of findings and preliminary order as provided for in andSection;1978.104,OSHA shall again contact the named person to give him or her notice ofthe substance of the relevant evidence supporting the complainant's allegationsas developed during the course of the investigation. The named person shallbe given the opportunity to submit a written response, to meet with theinvestigators and to present statements from rebuttal witnesses.

If the AssistantSecretary concludes that there is reasonable cause to believe that a violationhas occurred, he shall accompany his findings with a preliminary orderproviding the relief prescribed in section 405(c)(2)(B). Such order willinclude, where appropriate, a requirement that the named person abate theviolation; reinstatement of the complainant to his or her former position,together with the compensation (including back pay), terms, conditionsand privileges of the complainant's employment; and payment of compensatorydamages. At the complainant's request the order may also assess againstthe named party the complainant's costs and expenses (including attorney'sfees) reasonably incurred in filing the complaint. (b) The findings and the preliminary order shall be sent by certified mail,return receipt requested, to all parties of record. The letter accompanyingthe findings and order shall inform the parties of the right to objectto the findings and/or the order and shall give the address of the ChiefAdministrative Law Judge. At the same time, the Assistant Secretary shallfile with the Chief Administrative Law Judge, U.S. Department of Labor,the original complaint and a copy of the findings and/or order.   (c) Upon the issuance of findings that there is reasonable cause to believethat a violation has occurred, any pending section 11(c) complaint willbe suspended until the section 405 proceeding is completed. When the section405 proceeding is completed the Assistant Secretary will determine whataction, if any, is appropriate on the section 11(c) complaint.
