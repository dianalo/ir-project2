Business leaders say the traffic threatens Jamaica's entireexport industry, which along with tourism is the economy's mostvibrant. Thousands of jobs and millions of dollars in preciousforeign earnings are at stake.   ``The problem is critical,'' said Lascelles Chin, managingdirector of Henkel Chemicals. ``If this is not curtailed, we areall in for a tough time.''   Shippers say with the tough government measures againsttrafficking, drug barons now are managing to slip marijuana, organja as it is called here, into legal cargoes. Some have beendetected by U.S. Customs agents and the shipping companies, eventhough they be be unaware of the shipments, face heavy fines.   Many have become reluctant to handle Jamaican exports.   In February, for example, a Kirk Lines ship, the MercandianSupplier, was found to be carrying 13,000 pounds of marijuana inits cargo of crackers bound for Miami, Fla. The U.S. CustomsService fined the company $103 million.   The biggest cargo carrier to serve this Caribbean nation,Evergreen Shipping of Taiwan, decided in June it will deliver butno longer accept containers in Jamaica after U.S. Customs in NewOrleans found marijuana hidden aboard them in late 1986. Thecompany is negotiating with U.S. Customs on the amount of fines tobe imposed.   U.S. Customs ordinarily imposes fines at the rate of $500 anounce of marijuana found, but it offers companies the opportunityto present mitigating evidence in an effort to lower those setamounts.   Four Air Jamaica planes have been seized in New York and Miamiafter contraband drugs were found aboard.   Exports are vital to this poor island nation of 2.4 millionpeople, where one of every four members of the work force isunemployed.   As world markets and prices collapsed in the 1980s for Jamaica'straditional products _ bauxite (from which aluminum is made), sugarand bananas _ other exports have picked up the slack.   About 29,000 jobs were created in factories making dresses,pants and other clothes for U.S. companies. Last year, exportsraised more than $700 million in foreign exchange, which Jamaicaneeds to buy oil, machinery, spare parts and food.   The exporters' response to the ganja barons has been to screenemployees, implement tamper-resistant packaging, and monitorproduction and delivery closely.   ``I schedule it so my truck arrives at the dock as soon as thegangplank is dropped,'' said Garfield Thomas, explaining that itlessens the chances for marijuana to be hidden in his shipments offruits and vegetables.   ``I give drivers cases of cold drinks and a can opener so theydon't have to stop on the way, and just hope they don't get apuncture (flat tire).''   Thomas added, however, that he has reduced his shipments becausethe produce was spoiling on U.S. docks while awaiting clearance byinspectors searching for drugs.   But as one ruse is uncovered, another develops.   ``Now we're finding marijuana in false bulkheads and falseroofs'' in the steel and fiberglass containers into whichmerchandise is loaded, said Francis Kennedy, president of theShipping Association of Jamaica. ``We've never had this problem asmuch as during the past six to eight weeks.''   Laborers from India introduced ganja to Jamaica in the mid-19thcentury. The subtropical climate is ideal for its cultivation; thefastest growing varieties can be harvested every three months.   Although cultivation and use of marijuana became common inJamaica, it posed few problems until traffickers started exportingit. In the 1970s, cocaine smuggling increased as aircraft stoppedover for refueling en route from South America to the United States.   Jamaica's two main political parties have condemned drugtrafficking and taken steps to halt it.   In the 1970s, the People's National Party government ofsocialist Prime Minister Michael Manley ordered illegal airstripsspiked, encouraged farmers to grow legal crops, and seizedcontraband planes.   The current prime minster, conservative Edward Seaga of theJamaica Labor Party, which came to power in 1980, has imposed stiffsanctions on traffickers, and threatened to shoot down drug planes.Thousands of acres of marijuana fields have been cut down, andhundreds of tons of marijuana have been burned.   U.S. funding, particularly for the Operation Buccaneer croperadication program, increased to $3.4 million last year from$49,000 in 1984.   Now farmers, for whom ganja is their most marketable crop, plantit on smaller patches in remote valleys and hillsides. They alsoare experimenting with faster growing varieties, neglectingtraditional crops.   Cocaine use, meanwhile, appears to be increasing among Jamaica'supper and middle classes, and trafficking is feared to bestimulating crime and corruption.   Jamaican officials say they are grappling with the problem asbest they can. But they bristle at statements by U.S. officials andat news accounts that they maintain cast Jamaica in a bad light.They cite as one example the allegation that political partiesaccept contributions from drug barons.   ``It is U.S. citizens who are creating the demand for drugs,subsidizing the planting of ganja in Jamaica and organizing andmanaging the transporting of ganja from Jamaica,'' Minister ofPublic Works Pearnel Charles was quoted as saying in a recentinterview with The Daily Gleaner of Kingston.   In April, Prime Minster Seaga lodged a formal protest with theU.S. State Department after he was linked in closed-door testimonyby a convicted drug trafficker before a Senate subcommittee withaccepting payoffs.   The State Department responded that the charges wereunsubstantiated.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Friday, August 5</NOTE></DOC>
