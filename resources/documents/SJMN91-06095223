Pete Wilson and some insurers.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  RECKLESS DEMOCRATS MISS NO-FAULT WAGON  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  CommentaryDeborah Saunders writes for the Los Angeles Daily News.  </MEMO><TEXT>     Standing in their way: the Democratic legislative leadership.;    You see,even if no-fault insurance could save California drivers, it wouldn't pay fora favored interest group in Sacramento -- California trial lawyers.;    Upuntil now, the Democratic leadership has been able to kill no-fault proposals.Last year, a no-fault measure by then-Assemblyman Pat Johnston, D-Stockton,was killed in committee after Assembly Speaker Willie Brown laid down the lawto members of his caucus. Afterward, two Demo co-sponsors didn't even vote fortheir bill.;    This year, however, no-fault boosters have an ace in the hole-- Wilson. Despite support by GOP legislators, former Gov. George Deukmejiandid not support no-fault. Cagey would be a good way to describe his positionon it.;    Wilson, however, is ready to take on the trial attorneys' bestfriends.;    Politically, this stand is a no-loser enabling the new governorto build bridges with independent Democrats, minority groups, some consumergroups and legislative representatives.;    But the biggest political plus ofall should be no-fault's benefits, not for any special interest group, but forthe people of California, if this year's no-fault measure, Senate Bill 941, byJohnston who is now a state senator, becomes law.;    SB 941 would create ano-fault system, strengthen a weakened mandatory insurance law, and institutea low-cost no-frills policy for good low-income drivers.;    Groups such asthe Latino Issues Forum and California Council of Urban Leagues have supportedthe measure because it would make insurance affordable for the poor.;   What's more, SB 941's provision requiring motorists to show proof of insurancewhen registering their vehicles should spell a reduction in uninsured motoristpremiums for all who buy it.;    Other costs would be reduced as well. SB 941basically would end litigation and pain and suffering compensation for minorclaims.;    Those seriously injured -- whose costs are over $5,000 -- stillwould be eligible for pain and suffering damages, as they should be. Andthey'd have recourse to arbitration and the courts.;    Meanwhile, byeliminating trials for nuisance claims and fender-benders, SB 941 could helpunclog California's courts. Johnston has pointed out that in New York, whose1977 no-fault law was the model for SB 941, auto accident court cases were cutby 80 percent.;    SB 941 also would require that insurers reimburse claimswithin 30 days or pay a penalty to the consumer.;    Opponents argue thatno-fault is wrong because it does away with the tort concept -- that theperson at fault should pay. But SB 941 would eliminate tort damages only forsmall claims. What's more, since insurers can raise the premiums for baddrivers, eventually at-fault drivers would pay.;    Public Citizen CaliforniaDirector Mike Johnson has criticized SB 941 because its low-cost policydoesn't include property damage liability.;    &quot;What Johnston's bill does . .. by eliminating the requirement that they carry property damage liabilityinsurance,&quot; he said Friday, is effectively to tell people, &quot;they don't have tobe responsible for the damages they cause.&quot;;    Johnson did see some appeal.&quot;From a very narrow, self-interested point of view, this policy could be agood deal for low-income drivers,&quot; he noted.;    And that's the irony of theDemocratic opposition to no-fault; it has those who fall in line with thelegislative leadership position looking at low prices for the poor as aspecial interest.;    And this year, the self-interested poor won't bepushovers for the Democratic leadership.;    &quot;We will mobilize a network tomake Willie (Brown) feel now is the time to be on the side of poor people,&quot;Alex Esclamado, president of the National Filipino-American Council, toldreporters last week.;    Pity the poor Sacramento pol. Now that legislativeterm limits are the law, these guys are going to have to show the voters thatthey've done something in order to get elected to different offices. What canthey point to?;    It will be interesting to see where their loyalties willlie.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  DEBRA J.
