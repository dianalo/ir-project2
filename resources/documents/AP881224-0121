Moammar Gadhafithat captives be released.   A statement issued by the Fatah Revolutionary Council, led by AbuNidal, said the girls to be released are the daughters of Frenchhostage Jacqueline Valente. They are Marie-Laure, 7, and Virginie, 6.   The council's statement also called for release of all kidnappedhostages in Lebanon, ``especially those uninvolved in any espionageactivity or those serving with humanitarian organizations.''   The group's announcement was released a few hours after Ms.Valente's mother, former husband and brother-in-law arrived in westBeirut from Paris to press for their relatives' freedom.   The statement set no date for their release. But the group'sspokesman, Walid Khaled, told The Associated Press the two girlswere to be freed within 24 hours.   Khaled said in November last year that his group captured thethree, along with five Belgians, from a French boat it seized offthe coast of the Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip. He accused the adultsof being Israeli spies, which their relatives deny.   ``In light of the appeal made by brother Moammar Gadhafi on theoccasion of Christmas and New Year for the release of the hostages,especially the two girls, Marie-Laure and Virginie, our CentralCommittee has decided to free the two girls within the framework ofspecific security arrangements set for this purpose,'' the statementsaid.   In April, the group offered to release Ms. Valente's olderdaughters, but Khaled said their mother refused to let them go.   The statement, released in Beirut, did not spell out the securityarrangements involved, nor did it indicate the captives'whereabouts. But it said Libya pledged to ``extend all the necessaryfacilities that will guarantee the safety of the two girls.''   The captives are widely believed held in the Palestinian refugeecamp of Ein el-Hilweh outside the southern port of Sidon.   Ms. Valente's brother-in-law, Andre Metral, said after thestatement was released that Khaled contacted him at the CavalierHotel in west Beirut and told him he wanted to see him, withoutsetting an exact date for the meeting.   But Metral said the meeting would most probably take placesometime Sunday and that Khaled had warned him that he does not wantany reporters present.   Ms. Valente, her daughters and the five Belgians have been calledthe ``forgotten hostages'' by the French media, since they are notamong 15 foreign hostages most commonly mentioned in press reports.Ms. Valente gave birth to a third daughter in captivity and isreportedly expecting a fourth child.   The French and Belgians have been held for more than a year byFatah Revolutionary Council, a radical guerrilla group led byPalestinian terrorist Abu Nidal. The Belgians being held areEmmanuel Houtekins, his wife, Godelieve, their two children,Valerie, 16, and Laurent, 17, and Emmanuel's brother, Fernand.   Abu Nidal, also known as Sabry Banna, is widely believed to haveorganized the December 1985 attacks at the Rome and Vienna airportsin which 16 people were killed. A former official of Fatah, afaction led by PLO chief Yasser Arafat, Abu Nidal split with the PLOin the early 1970s. The Fatah Revolutionary Council is not part ofthe PLO.   The statement's call for release of hostages doing humanitarianwork or those not involved in espionage appeared to refer to Belgiandoctor Jan Cools, 32, who disappeared May 21 after leaving hisapartment in the Rashidiyeh Palestinian refugee camp near Lebanon'ssouthern port of Tyre.   Cools worked for the Norwegian Norwac humanitarian organizationfor three months before he vanished. A previously unknown groupcalling itself ``The Soldiers of Justice'' claimed responsibilityfor his abduction Dec. 18.   With the statement, the Abu Nidal group was apparently trying todistance itself from the death threats that led the InternationalCommittee of the Red Cross to suspend services and evacuate allSwiss personnel from Lebanon this week. One of its workers wasrecently kidnapped in Sidon and then released.   Also Saturday, friends and relatives of American hostages TerryAnderson and Thomas Sutherland and British captive John McCarthyappealed for their release in Christmas letters published in Beirutnewspapers.   The U.S.-based Journalists' Committee to Free Terry Andersoncalled on pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem extremists to free him andSutherland ``in the name of humanity.''   The two Americans are among 15 Westerners missing in Lebanon.Anderson and Sutherland are believed held by a pro-Iranian Shiitegroup known as the Islamic Jihad, or Holy War.   Anderson, 41, the chief Middle East correspondent for TheAssociated Press, is the longest-held of the hostages. He waskidnapped March 16, 1985.   Scottish-born Sutherland, 56, of Fort Collins, Colo., was actingdean of agriculture at the American University in Beirut when gunmenseized him June 9, 1985.   McCarthy, 32, of London, a producer for the London-basedWorldwide Television News, disappeared April 17, 1986. No group hasclaimed to have kidnapped him.</TEXT></DOC>
