The assessment of seismic hazard for the safety of nuclear plantsis in fact based upon a seismotectonic approach which needs to take intoaccount the seismic activity over as long a period of time as possible.The method adopted for reviewing historical earthquakes entails a systematicconsultation of the original sources and a critical analysis there ofin the light of the historical, geographical and political contexts ofthe time. The same standards apply where the acquisition of new elementsof information is involved. Each item of information is assigned a degreeof reliability, then compiled in a computer file, up-dated annually;this file currently contains more than 4.500 events covering a periodof time of about a millenary.</TEXT></DOC>
