(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Bush, in his first comments onSoviet arms reductions, said Saturday he welcomed the move and saidhe wanted to win the ``peace war'' with Soviet President MikhailGorbachev.   The president, reacting to Gorbachev's announced cut of 500short-range missiles in eastern Europe, challenged the Sovietleader to make good on his promise to reduce the Soviet's nucleararsenal.   ``Let him do what he says, unilaterally. It would be good,''Bush said aboard Air Force One.   His remarks indicated adherence to his opposition tonegotiations with the Soviets for cuts in NATO tactical nuclearweapons in western Europe.   ``We've already removed 2,000 tactical nuclear weapons, and itwould be nice to have him go ahead and make some moves,'' Bush said.   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush wasreferring to ``well over 2,000'' obsolete nuclear warheads that theArmy has taken out of service in western Europe over the past fewyears.   Bush commented a day after he called for a new openness inU.S.-Soviet relations that would bring the Soviet Union``back intothe world order,'' including a call for mutual surveillance flightsover NATO and Warsaw Pact territories.   But Bush, in Friday's speech to Texas Aandamp;M University, mixedoptimism over recent political reforms in the Soviet Union with aninsistence that promises be met with deeds, a theme he repeated onSaturday in his chat with reporters.   Gorbachev's announcement on the cuts on Soviet weapons onThursday, made to U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III inMoscow, caught U.S. officials by surprise.   However, Bush on Saturday, when asked if he thought he would winthe public-relations war with his Soviet counterpart, declared:``No such war. I want to win the peace war, lasting peace, thatbuilt on action not on words.''   ``Action is what I talked about yesterday,'' Bush said.   ``I think we will prevail,'' he added.   Bush's refusal to consider reductions in U.S. Lance missiles ineastern Europe until the Soviet superiority in conventional weaponsis erased has split NATO.   Meanwhile, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze saidSaturday in West Germany that the Kremlin would consider arearmament step or a break with the intermediate-range nuclear armstreaty if NATO upgrades its short-range nuclear missiles.   Shevardnadze met with West German Foreign Minister Hans-DietrichGenscher in Bonn Saturday, and the talks focused on the contentiousmissile issue.   Fitzwater declined immediate comment on Shevardnadze's statement.   Bush said he had not yet received any reaction from allies tohis call for mutual surveillance flights, a revival of anEisenhower-era ``open skies'' proposal.   The president said he had talked by phone to Baker on Saturdaymorning, when both of them were in Houston, to discuss briefly thesecretary of state's trip to Moscow.   On other subjects, Bush declined to discuss the situation inPanama, brushing aside reports that Venezuela might have offeredpolitical asylum to Panamian leader Manuel Antonio Noriega.   Bush indicated he would have something to say on the subject ofPanama over the next few days, although did not disclose the forum.   Fitzwater suggested that the administration did not want toelaborate upon the tense situation in Panama at this time because``the stated policy is to protect American lives.''   Bush earlier in the week dispatched 2,000 U.s. troops toreinforce American bases and protect Americans living there.   The president talked with reporters on Air Force One in Houstonbefore back-to-back commencement speeches in Mississippi _ speechesthat extolled virtues of education, family and work and did nottouch upon current events.   In a speech to predominantly black Alcorn State University hereat Lorman, Bush said the ``economic transformation wrought byhistorically black colleges such as Alcorn is nothing less thanastounding.''   Noting that while 85-percent of graduates in such schools camefrom blue-collar families, ``almost all go on to professional ormanagerial positions.''   ``It's an exciting tradition, and one of the mostunder-appreciated success stories in America,'' he said.   Deputy press secretary Stephen Hart said that a member of aMississippi SWAT team assigned to provide security at Alcorn Stateaccidentally fired his rifle.   The episode occurred before the president's helicopter landed,and no one was hurt, Hart said.   Later, in remarks prepared for commencement at Mississippi StateUniversity in Jackson, Miss., Bush spoke of the ``values ofAmerica's good, quiet, decent people _ Americans who know that weare not the sum of our possessions, but of how we conductourselves.''   ``These people form the heart of our society,'' Bush said.   ``The postwar period has given way to a new world _ a worldstill perilous, but alive with prospects for peace and withcertainty of change. Yet there are some things that haven't changedsince 1948. America's values haven't.''   Bush quoted slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King in hisAlcorn State speech: ``intelligence is not enough. Intelligenceplus character _ that is the true goal of education.''And in thespeech to Mississippi State, Bush evoked the memory of Mississippinovelist William Faulkner, who spent most of his life in the area.``Let Faulkner's `verities and truths of the heart' be ourvalues,'' he said.   Bush planned to outline his administration's emerging foreignpolicy strategy in a series of five speeches. His Texas Aandamp;M speechwas the first, and he is also to dwell on East-West relations in aspeech next weekend at Boston University.   He was to travel to Lexington, Ky., later Saturday to attend afund-raising dinner for the re-election campaign of Republican Sen.Mitch McConnell. It was Bush's first appearance at a politicalfund-raising event as president.   Bush was to spend the night in Kentucky at the home of a friend,then return to Washington on Sunday.   Bush spent Friday night in Houston, at the Houstonian Hotel,which had been his official voting residence as vice president.   He jogged both Friday night and Saturday morning on the hotelgrounds, and on Friday night took a group of friends to a localHouston barbecue and spare ribs restaurant, walking around theestablishment shaking hands with patrons.</TEXT></DOC>
