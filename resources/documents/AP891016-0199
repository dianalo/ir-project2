Ethnic Chinese firstarrived in the San Francisco area in the mid-1800s and now numberabout 200,000. They sit on virtually all the major boards of thecity.   Many of the ethnic Chinese in San Francisco and elsewhere in theUnited States are only first- and second-generation Americans. The1980 U.S. census found that of nearly 900,000 Americans reportingChinese ancestry more than half spoke Chinese at home. Nearly300,000 people said they were born in China and 155,000 otherslisted Taiwan and Hong Kong as their birth places.   Wang believes the ``relative newcomers'' among Chinese-Americansare ``much more likely to be sensitive to developments in China.''   Indeed, many ethnic Chinese in North America have activelybacked the pro-democracy movement.   The Chinese community of San Francisco organized several groupsin support of the Beijing students and staged dozens of rallies andfund-raising dinners.   Chinese-Americans in Chicago donated money to buy facsimilemachines, computers and other equipment for the pro-democracymovement.   In Toronto, as many as 30,000 people, many of themChinese-Canadians, demonstrated June 4 to protest the harshmilitary crackdown on the Beijing students in Tiananmen Square. Theturnouts were considered extraordinary for the traditionally placidcommunity.   Some Chinese-Canadians also strongly criticized the Canadiangovernment _ Foreign Secretary Joe Clark in particular _ forapproving a large loan to China in August.   ``How can Joe Clark turn around and do that?'' said Tom Pang,president of the Chinese Community Center. ``The blood on thesquare is barely dry.''   But support for the democracy movement among overseas Chinese inthe West was by no means universal.   ``There are a number of Chinese entrepreneurs in London whodon't want to rock the boat, and in fact some of them have openlycondemned the democracy movement,'' said Anthony Shang, 36, atelevision producer who has lived in the British capital for 20years.   He said that among the people who have adopted ``very cautious''attitudes are some operators of the 6,000 Chinese restaurants andsupermarkets in Britain who buy foodstuffs from China.   ``There is a degree of hypocrisy amongst the older communityleaders who are inevitably tied up with business,'' Shang added.   To what degree, then, is there a sense of dual loyalty to bothChina and the country in which the hua qiao live?   ``If a white man asks me that, he's questioning my loyalty bymerely asking,'' said David Liu, chairman of the Chicago chapter ofthe Washington-based Organization of Chinese Americans. ``It's aninsult. Why don't the Caucasians ask Russian immigrants about theirloyalty?''   But Rolland Lowe, president of the Foundation for ChineseDemocracy in the San Francisco area, acknowledged that some huaqiao have a conflict.   ``They are Americans but somehow they think they are Chinese,''he said.   But he added: ``I keep my hat straight as to who I am.''   That is to say, he is an American.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Oct. 22</NOTE></DOC>
