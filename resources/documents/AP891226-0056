Temperatures stayed below freezing overnight throughout much ofthe South. It was 30 degrees in Jacksonville, Fla., at 4 a.m. EST.But temperatures were expected to reach the 60s in the Carolinas bythe end of the week, the National Weather Service said.   ``The roads are passable, but it's a sheet of ice in mostplaces,'' said Larry Dozier of the Dare County, N.C., sheriff'sdepartment.   A new cold front, not as severe as the one that set hundreds oflow temperature records last week, swung down from Canada and snowfell today in an arc from Indiana and Kentucky to Maine, theNational Weather Service said.   West of that air mass, the weather was mild in many places andDickinson, N.D., had a reading of 36 above zero at 6 a.m.   During the weekend, a rare Southern blizzard brought up to 15inches of snow to Wilmington, N.C., the most ever measured there,but much of that was expected to melt today with highs in the 40s.It was the first white Christmas in more than a century in thecoastal city, in Georgia and in Mobile, Ala., on the Gulf Coast.Snow also dusted northern Florida.   Citrus growers in Florida and Texas reported extensive cropdamage.   Officials in Texas estimated 70 percent of the state's citruscrop and 80 percent of the winter vegetable crop was destroyed whenthe temperatures plunged into the low 20s and upper teens as theholiday weekend began.   Citrus losses are estimated at $200 million so far and could top$500 million as trees begin to show effects from the freeze, saidDavid Galvan, district director of the Texas Department ofAgriculture in Brownsville.   Florida officials hadn't released citrus loss figures yet today,but damage is likely to be substantial to the state's $3.5 billioncrop since much of it was still on the trees when freezingtemperatures began Saturday. Strawberry crops suffered less damage.   In South Carolina, airlines resumed normal schedules atCharleston today after reducing flights because of the snow, anairport spokeswoman said. The Myrtle Beach Jetport, closed for athird straight day Monday, also was expected to resume operationssometime later today; the jetport can operate only during daylightbecause runway lights are covered with snow, said Todd Crawford,deputy airport director.   In Florida, Mike Mahoney, spokesman for Tampa Electric Co.,appealed to families in a six-county area to shut off Christmastree lights to save energy. Other Florida utilities imposedrotating brownouts, and in some caes, blackouts.   More than 60,000 homes and businesses in Jackson, Miss., werewithout water or had greatly reduced pressure because of water-mainbreaks and because the Pearl River had frozen around intakes forthe municipal water system. The city government was closed becauseof the water problem.   Texas cities also had broken water pipes, with more than 6,000leaks reported in Houston, and some people had been without watersince Friday. Hotels in Houston offered discount rates for peoplewho wanted to take showers.   Taps also ran dry in the Charleston, S.C., area.   ``There's got to be thousands of broken lines out there,'' saidSteve Kinard, manager of Charleston's public works department,which supplies water to 400,000 people.   ``We've got water mains and pipes bursting all over the city,everything from hotels to businesses to homes,'' said George A.Ingram, a fire chief in Norfolk, Va.   At least 93 deaths from the Plains to the East Coast have beenblamed on the cold since Dec. 15. Victims this weekend included an18-year-old boy who fell through ice on a lake in DeKalb County,Ga., and a 7-week-old boy who froze to death in his crib in anunheated apartment in Miami. Police said they may charge theparents, who left the baby unattended after an argument.   The Plains celebrated Christmas with a respite from subzerotemperatures, but a fresh blast of arctic chill blew across thenorthern Plains and upper Great Lakes late Monday, dropping as muchas 10 inches of snow in parts of Michigan.   Christmas Day was the coldest day ever in Wilmington, N.C.,where it fell to zero degrees. Its previous all-time low was 5degrees in February 1899. Records also were set Monday for the datein Florida with lows of 29 in Fort Lauderdale, 30 in Miami and 46in Key West.   Farther north, the cold prevented the annual re-enactment ofGeorge Washington's crossing of the Delaware River to captureBritish troops at Trenton, N.J. ``We couldn't get our four boatsinto the river because it was a sheet of ice,'' said JamesGallagher, who has played the role of Washington since 1985.   And in Buffalo, N.Y., organizers who struggled for three yearsto stage a Winterfest of snow sculpting and ice skating despitebalmy temperatures gave up this year and canceled the festival _and then the snow began. With nearly 3 feet of snow so far thisseason, Buffalo had its first white Christmas since 1985.   ``Someone just called me and said, `Can't you bring it back?Then we won't have any snow,''' said Dottie Gallagher, spokeswomanfor Buffalo Place, which had been one of the sponsors.   It wasn't cold all over the country, though. In SouthernCalifornia, surfers got to try out new gift surfboards on Christmasas temperatures peaked in the low 80s.   ``All I want to do is swim and enjoy the heat,'' said LindaKinsey of Chicago as she stepped off a plane at Los AngelesInternational Airport.</TEXT></DOC>
