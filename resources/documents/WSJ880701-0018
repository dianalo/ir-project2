Santa Clara, Calif.-based National Semiconductor agreed to pay $122 million for Fairchild. It issued Schlumberger 4.1 million common shares, plus 4.1 million warrants to buy its common at $22.25 a share. As part of the transaction, it agreed to make up in cash any difference between the market value of the shares and warrants, and the $122 million.    The agreement to repurchase shares from Schlumberger was disclosed after yesterday's market close. The purchase is expected to be completed on or about July 11. If it were done today, National Semiconductor would have to pay Schlumberger about $54 million of cash, $53 million for the common shares and $15 million for the warrants. </TEXT></DOC>
