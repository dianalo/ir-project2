The government wants a court to compel Jeremy Warner, a newspaper reporter, to divulge his sources of information for articles that predicted antitrust decisions crucial to the outcome of corporate takeovers. The government is investigating possible insider trading by civil servants knowledgeable about the decisions in advance or by traders who received leaked information.    The investigation, launched last December, apparently has foundered because of uncooperative witnesses. Officials of the Department of Trade and Industry, which is conducting the probe, said that they don't suspect Mr. Warner but that he could help to identify those who leaked the information.    Mr. Warner, a reporter for The Independent newspaper here, said he refuses to give up the sources for the articles because they spoke on condition of anonymity.    The significance of the case goes beyond the investigation involved. Under a law that took effect last November, the government for the first time can force witnesses in insider-trading cases to testify or face fines or imprisonment as if they were in contempt of court.    The government repeatedly has said that the law heralds a tough new era of insider-trading law enforcement, castigated by critics as weak in the past. Mr. Warner is the first witness to test the government's resolve to enforce the new law.    Neither the government nor Mr. Warner has identified which bids or articles the journalist is being pressed about. Yesterday, Mr. Warner would say only that he had been questioned by investigators about two stories.    Government sources have said the probe includes antitrust decisions last year involving a bid by Britain's General Electric Co., equivalent to about $1.89 billion, for Plessey Co.; Hillsdown Holdings PLC's $765 million bid for Sandamp;W Berisford PLC, and Norton Opax PLC's $257.7 million purchase of McCorquodale PLC. One witness in the investigation, however, said that DTI investigators are interested in articles by Mr. Warner on other bids, suggesting a much broader investigation.    Mr. Warner said that government inspectors questioned him under under oath Feb. 25 and that he declined to divulge his sources for the articles. He said he did so again in response to written questions from the investigators. He then received a notice that the government was starting legal proceedings to force him to name the sources. A preliminary court hearing on the government's move is scheduled for today.    Britain lacks anything like the &quot;shield laws&quot; that protect journalists' confidential sources in many U.S. states. The new financial-regulation law, however, does carry protections from testifying for lawyers and bankers when a client's confidence would be violated. Mr. Warner said he will argue to broadly interpret those protections and apply them to journalists. </TEXT></DOC>
