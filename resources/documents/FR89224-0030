Background</ITAG> Title III of the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act, asamended (``Act''), 16 U.S.C 1431 <T3>et seq.,</T3> authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to designate discreteareas of the marine environment as national marine sanctuaries if, as requiredby section 303 of the Act (16 U.S.C. 1433), the Secretary finds, in consultationwith Congress, a variety of fulfill the purposes and policies of TitleIII (set forth in section 301(b) of the Act (16 U.S.C. 1431(b)) and: (1)The area proposed for designation is of special national significance dueto its resource or human-use values; (2) existing state and Federal authoritiesare inadequate to ensure coordinated and comprehensive conservation andmanagement of the area, including resource protection, scientific research,and public education; (3) designation of the area as a national marinesanctuary will facilitate the coordinated and comprehensive conservationand management of the area; and (4) the area is of a size and nature thatwill permit comprehensive and coordinated conservation and management.Before the Secretary may designate an area as a national marine sanctuary,section 303 (16 U.S.C. 1433) requires him or her to make the above describedfindings and section 304 (16 U.S.C. 1434), setting forth the proceduresfor designation, requires him or her to issue in the <T4> Federal Register</T4> this notice of the proposal, proposed regulations,and a summary of the draft management plan.The authority of the Secretary to designate national marine sanctuariesand administer the other provisions of the Act has been delegated to theAssistant Administrator for Ocean Services and Coastal Zone Managementin the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (DOC/DAO 25-5A,andSection; 3.01(z), Aug. 26, 1985, as amended; NOAA Circular 83-38, Sept.21, 1983, as amended).The Flower Garden Banks are two of over thirty major outer-continentalshelf structures in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico. The East and WestFlower Garden Banks, separated by eight nautical miles of open water, sustainthe northernmost living coral reefs on the U. S. continental shelf. Thecomplex and biologically productive reef communities that cap the Banksare in delicate ecological balance because of the fragile nature of coraland the fact that the Banks lie on the extreme northern edge of the zonein which extensive reef development can occur. In addition to their coralreefs, the Banks harbor the only known oceanic brine seep in continentalshelf waters of the Atlantic Ocean. Because of these features, the FlowerGarden Banks offer a combination of esthetic appeal and recreational andresearch opportunity matched in few other ocean areas.In April 1979, NOAA published proposed regulations (44 FR 22081) and adraft environmental impact statement (DEIS) on the proposed designationof the East and West Flower Garden Banks as a national marine sanctuary.However, a final EIS was not prepared. NOAA withdrew the DEIS in April1982, and removed the site from the list of areas being considered fordesignation. One of the major reasons for this action was that a FisheryManagement Plan (FMP) for coral in the Gulf of Mexico was about to be implemented.It was expected that the FMP and its implementing regulations would protectthe coral formations in the area of the proposed national marine sanctuaryform being damaged by large-vessel anchoring. However, the final regulationsimplementing the FMP (49 FR 29607 (1984)) did not include the expected``no anchoring'' provision.The continued lack of a ban on large-vessel anchoring led to renewed interestin ensuring the site's protection by designating it as a national marinesanctuary, and on August 2, 1984 NOAA announced (49 FR 30988) that theFlower Garden Banks had again become an Active Candidate for sanctuarydesignation. On June 24, 1986, NOAA sponsored a public scoping meetingin Galveston, Texas, to solicit public comment on the scope and significanceof issues involved in designating the sanctuary. Again the response wasgenerally favorable to proceeding with the evaluation.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Summary of the Draft Management Plan </ITAG>The draft management plan for the proposed Flower Garden Banks NationalMarine Sanctuary recognizes the need for a balanced approach to managementthat reflects the multiple use character of the area as well as the needto protect its resources. The plan is designed to guide management of thesanctuary for the first five years after implementation. After describingthe proposed sanctuary's location, resources and uses, the management plandiscusses proposed programs for resource protection, research, and interpretationand details agency administrative roles and responsibilities. The proposed designation of the Flower Garden Banks as a national marinesanctuary focuses attention on the value of the area's resources. To ensurethat these resources are protected, the sanctuary resource protection programincludes: (1) Coordination of policies and procedures among the agenciessharing responsibility for resource protection; (2) participation by interestedagencies and organizations in the development of procedures to addressspecific management concerns (e.g., monitoring and emergency-response programs);and (3) the enforcement of sanctuary regulations in addition to other regulationsalready in place. Effective management of the sanctuary requires the initiation of a sanctuaryresearch program that addresses management issues. The sanctuary researchprogram will be directed to improving knowledge of the sanctuary's resourcesand environment and of how they may be affected by various types of humanactivity. To avoid duplication of effort and achieve maximum benefits fromthe research, NOAA will coordinate its research efforts with those of otheragencies. Increased public understanding and appreciation of the value of FlowerGarden Bank natural resources is essential for their protection. The interpretationprogram for the proposed Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuarywill be directed to developing public awareness of the sanctuary, its resources,and the regulations designed to protect them. Under the preferred management alternative, the proposed Flower GardenBanks National Marine Sanctuary would be managed, at least initially, byNOAA's Marine and Estuarine Management Division in Washington, DC. Sanctuaryenforcement personnel will be headquartered locally. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Proposed Designation Document </ITAG>Section 304(a)(4) of the Act requires that the proposed designation includethe geographic area proposed to be included within the sanctuary; the characteristicsof the area that give it conservation, recreational, ecological, historical,research, educational, or esthetic value; and the types of activities thatwill be subject to regulation by the Secretary to protect these characteristics.The section also specifies that the terms of the designation may be modifiedonly by the same procedures by which the original designation was made.Thus the terms of the designation serve as a constitution for the sanctuary.Proposed Designation Document for the Flower Garden Banks National MarineSanctuary Under the authority of Title III of the Marine Protection, Research, andSanctuaries Act of 1972, as amended (Act), 16 U.S.C. 1431 <T3>et seq., </T3>the waters over the East and West Flower Garden Banksin the Gulf of Mexico, as described in Article 2, are hereby designatedas a National Marine Sanctuary for the purpose of protecting and conservingthese two highly productive marine areas and the waters over them and ensuringthe continued availability of the areas and the waters as ecological, recreational,research and educational resources. <ITAG tagnum="81">Article 1. Effect of Designation </ITAG>Regarding the area designated as the Flower Garden Banks National MarineSanctuary (Sanctuary), described in Article 2, the Act authorizes the promulgationof such regulations as are necessary and reasonable to protect the characteristicsof the Sanctuary that give it conservation, recreational, ecological, historical,research, educational, or esthetic value. Restrictions on activities maybe imposed only by specific regulation. Section 2 of Article 4 of thisDesignation Document lists those activities which have been identifiedas activities that may require regulation now or in the future in orderto protect Sanctuary resources. Listing does not by itself imply that anactivity will be regulated. However, activities not listed may be regulated,other than on an emergency basis under Section 3 of Article 4, only byamending Section 2 of Article 4 by the same procedures through which theoriginal designation was made. <ITAG tagnum="81">Article 2. Description of the Area </ITAG>The Sanctuary boundaries encompass a total of 41.70 square nautical miles(143.02 square kilometers): 19.20 square nautical miles (65.85 square kilometers)at the East Bank and 22.50 square nautical miles (77.17 square kilometers)at the West Bank. The precise boundaries are defined in the regulations.<ITAG tagnum="81">Article 3. Characteristics of the Area That Give It Particular Value</ITAG>The Flower Gardens sustain the northernmost living coral reefs on the U.S.continental shelf. They are isolated from other reef systems by over 300n.m. (550 km) and exist under hydrographic conditions generally consideredmarginal for tropical reef formation. The composition, diversity and verticaldistribution of benthic communities on the Banks are strongly influencedby this physical environment. Epibenthic populations are distributed amongseveral interrelated biotic zones, including a <T3>Diploria-Montastrea-Porites </T3>zone, a <T3>Madracis mirabilis </T3>zone, and an algal sponge zone.The complex and biologically productive reef communities that cap the Banksoffer a ccmbination of esthetic appeal and recreational and research opportunitymatched in few other ocean areas. These reef communities are in delicateecological balance because of the fragile nature of coral and the factthat the Banks lie on the extreme northern edge of the zone in which extensivereef development can occur. In addition to their coral reefs, the Bankscontain the only known oceanic brine seep in continental shelf waters ofthe Atlantic Ocean. Because of these features, the Flower Gardens are particularlyvaluable for scientific research. <ITAG tagnum="81">Article 4. Scope of Regulation </ITAG><T3>Section 1. Activities Subject to Regulation. </T3>The following activitiesmay be regulated within the Sanctuary and adjacent waters to the extentnecessary and reasonable to ensure the protection of Sanctuary characteristicsthat give it conservation, recreational, ecological, historical, research,educational or esthetic value: a. Anchoring by vessels; b. Depositing or discharging of materials or substances; c. Altering the seabed except by hydrocarbon exploration and developmentin Sanctuary areas lying outside of the no-activity zones established bythe Department of the Interior and defined by the topographic featuresstipulation for OCS lease sale 112; d. Removing or injuring coral or other resources; e. Using fishing gear other than conventional hook and line gear; and f. Detonating explosives or releasing electrical charges. <T3>Section 2. Consistency with International Law_</T3>The regulationsgoverning activities listed in Section 1 of this Article shall apply toforeign flag vessels and persons not citizens of the United States onlyto the extent consistent with generally recognized principles of internationallaw, and in accordance with treaties, conventions, and other agreementsto which the United States is a party. <T3>Section 3. Emergency Regulations_</T3>Where essential to prevent immediate,serious, and irreversible damage to the ecosystem of the area, activitiesnot listed in Section 1 of this Article may be regulated within the limitsof the Act on an emergency basis for a period not to exceed 120 days. <ITAG tagnum="81">Article 5. Relation to Other Regulatory Programs </ITAG><T3>Section 1. Fishing_</T3>The regulation of the use of conventional hookand line fishing gear is not authorized under Article 4. All regulatoryprograms pertaining to fishing, including Fishery Management Plans promulgatedunder the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act, 16 U.S.C. 1801<T3>et seq., </T3>shall remain in effect. Where regulations promulgatedunder these programs are in conflict with Sanctuary regulations, the morerestrictive regulations will prevail. <T3>Section 2. Defense Activities_</T3>The regulation of activities listedin Article 4 will not prohibit any Department of Defense activity thatis necessary for national defense. All activities carried out by the Departmentof Defense within the area of the proposed Sanctuary on the effective dateof designation that are necessary for the national defense shall not besubject to Sanctuary prohibitions. Additional activities having the potentialfor significant environmental impact may be exempted from regulation afterconsultation between the Department of Commerce and the Department of Defense.<T3>Section 3. Other Programs_</T3>All applicable regulatory programs shallremain in effect. Where regulations promulgated under these programs arein conflict with Sanctuary regulations, the more restrictive regulationsshall prevail. <ITAG tagnum="81">Article 6. Alterations to This Designation </ITAG>This designation may be altered only in accordance with the same proceduresby which it has been made, including public hearings, consultation withinterested Federal and State agencies and the Gulf of Mexico Fishery ManagementCouncil, review by the appropriate Congressional committees, and approvalby the Secretary of Commerce or his or her designee. <ITAG tagnum="85">IV. Summary of Proposed Regulations </ITAG>The proposed regulations would prohibit a relatively narrow range of activitiesin the proposed Sanctuary, would establish procedures for issuing permitsto conduct otherwise prohibited activities for a narrow range of purposesand would set forth the maximum per day penalty for conducting a prohibitedactivity without a permit. Specifically, the proposed regulations would add a new part 943 to title15, Code of Federal Regulations. Proposed andSection; 943.1 would set forth the statutory authority for thedesignation of the Sanctuary and for the issuance of the regulations. Proposed andSection; 943.2 would set forth as the purposes for designatingthe Sanctuary: (1) Protecting and conserving the East and West Flower GardenBanks and the waters over them; and (2) ensuring the continued availabilityof the Banks and the waters as ecological, recreational, research, andeducational resources. Proposed andSection; 943.3 and the appendix following propose andSection; 943.10would set forth the boundaries of the Sanctuary. Proposed andSection; 943.4 would define various terms used in the regulations.``Conventional hook and line'' would be defined as any apparatus composedof a single line terminated by a combination of sinkers and hooks or luresand spooled upon a reel that may be hand or electrically operated, handheld or mounted. ``Injure'' would be defined as to change adversely, eitherin the long- or short-term, a chemical or physical quality or the viabilityof a Sanctuary resource. ``Person'' would be defined to mean any privateindividual, partnership, corporation, or other entity; or any officer,employee, agent, agency, department or instrumentality of the Federal government,of any State or local government, or of any foreign government. ``Sanctuaryresource'' would be defined to mean any living or non-living resource ofthe Sanctuary that contributes to its conservation, recreational, ecological,historical, research, educational or esthetic value, including, but notlimited to the carbonate-rock substratum of the Banks, corals and corallinealgae, benthic invertebrates, brine-seep biota, pelagic fish, turtles andmarine mammals. Proposed andSection; 943.6 would prohibit a variety of activities and makeit unlawful for any person to conduct them. However, any of the prohibitedactivities could be conducted lawfully if necessary for national defense;if necessary to respond to an emergency threatening life, property, orthe environment; or pursuant to a permit issued by the Assistant Administatorfor Ocean Services and Coastal Zone Management under proposed andSection;943.8. The first activity prohibited would be anchoring within the Sanctuary byvessels greater than 100 feet in registered length. Vessels of 100 feetor less in registered length would be allowed to anchor in the Sanctuary,however, such vessels would be prohibited from using more than 15 feetof chain or wire rope attached to their anchors and from using anchor lines(exclusive of such chain or wire rope) that are not constructed of softfiber or nylon, polypropylene, or similar material. These proposed prohibitions on anchoring are necessary to protect the fragilecoral bottom from damage. Although the proposed regulations would permitvessels of 100 feet or less in registered length to anchor subject to thelimitations on anchoring gear, should such anchoring by these vessels damagecoral resources, it could be prohibited or further regulated by regulatoryamendment. The second activity prohibited would be depositing or discharging fromany location within the boundaries of the Sanctuary, materials or substancesof any kind, including anesthetics and toxins used for taking or collectingfish, but excepting fish or parts and chumming materials (bait) and water(including cooling water) and other biodegradable effluents as specified.Depositing or discharging, from any location beyond the boundaries of theSanctuary, materials or substances of any kind except for the exclusionsdiscussed above, would also be prohibited if they enter the Sanctuary andinjure a Sanctuary resource.The third activity prohibited would be dredging, constructing structuresor otherwise altering the seabed, or attempting to do so, for any purposeother than the authorized installation of navigational aids or incidentalto hydrocarbon exploration and development in areas of the Sanctuary lyingoutside of the no-activity zones established by the Department of the Interiorand defined by the topographical lease sale 112.The fourth activity prohibited would be injuring, damaging, taking or removing,or attempting to injure, damage, take or remove, any fish (except by conventionalhook and line gear or by spearfishing gear), marine invertebrate, coralor other bottom formation, or plant. Any such resource found in the possessionof a person within the Sanctuary would be presumed, subject to refutation,to have been taken from the Sanctuary.The fifth activity prohibited would be the collecting, harvesting, or takingof any fish by use of bottom longlines, traps, nets, bottom trawls or anyother gear, device, equipment or means except by use of conventional hookand line gear or spearfishing gear. While spearfishing could be regulatedor prohibited by regulatory amendment if deemed necessary for resourceprotection, the use of conventional hook and line gear could not be regulatedor prohibited except on an emergency basis, without amending the designationdocument.The sixth and last prohibited activity would be detonating explosives orreleasing electrical charges within the Sanctuary.Proposed andSection; 943.5 would allow all activities to be conducted inthe Sanctuary (subject to all other prohibitions, restrictions, or conditionsimposed under any other program) except for those activities specificallyprohibited in proposed andSection; 943.6. Thus, vessels of 100 feet or lessin registered length could anchor in the Sanctuary subject to certain restrictionson their use of anchoring gear, and fish could be taken by use of conventionalhook and line fishing gear and spearfishing gear.Proposed andSection; 943.7 would set forth the maximum statutory civil penaltyper day for conducting a prohibited activity_$50,000. Each day of a continuingviolation would constitute a separate violation. Further, <T3>in rem </T3>actions against any vessel used in conducting a prohibitedactivity would be statutorily authorized. Regulations setting forth theadministrative procedures governing the assessment of civil penalties,enforcement hearings, and appeals, permit sanctions and denials for enforcementreasons, and the issuance of written warnings appear at Part 904, title15, Code of Federal Regulations.Proposed andSection; 943.8 would set forth the procedures for applying fora permit to conduct a prohibited activity in the Sanctuary and the criteriagoverning the issuance or denial of such permits. Permits would be grantedby the Assistant Administrator for Ocean Services and Castal Zone Managementif he or she finds that the activity will further research related to Sanctuaryresources; further the educational, historical or cultural value of theSanctuary; further salvage or recovery operations in or near the Sanctuaryin connection with a recent air or marine casualty, or assist in the managementof the Sanctuary. In deciding whether to issue a permit, the AssistantAdministrator may consider such factors as the professional qualificationsand financial ability of the applicant as related to the proposed activity,the appropriateness of the methods and procedures proposed by the applicantfor the conduct of the activity, the extent to which the conduct of theactivity may diminish or enhance the values for which the Sanctuary wasdesignated, and the end value of the applicant's overall activity. Proposed andSection; 943.9 would set forth the procedures governing appealsof the grant, conditioning, amendment, suspension or revocation of permitsby the Assistant Administrator. Proposed andSection; 943.10 would state that all permits, licenses, and otherauthorizations issued pursuant to any other authority are valid withinthe Sanctuary subject only to the prohibitions set forth in proposed andSection;943.6. All applicable regulatory programs would remain in effect. If regulationspromulgated by another authority are in conflict with Sanctuary regulations,the more restrictive regulations apply. <ITAG tagnum="84">V. Miscellaneous Rulemaking Requirements </ITAG>Executive Order 12291 Under Executive Order 12291, the Department must judge whether the regulationsproposed in this notice are ``major'' within the meaning of section 1 ofthe Order, and therefore subject to the requirement that a Regulatory ImpactAnalysis be prepared. The Assistant Administrator has determined that theregulations proposed in this notice are not major because, if adopted,they are not likely to result in: (1) An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; (2) A major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, state or local government agencies or geographic regions; or,(3) Significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.Regulatory Flexibility Act The regulations proposed in this notice would allow all activities to beconducted in the proposed sanctuary other than a narrow range of prohibitedor restricted activities. These prohibitions and restrictions are not expectedto have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities and the General Counsel of the Department of Commerce has so certifiedto the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administrationthat these proposed rules, if adopted, will not have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities because the proposed regulationswould have no effect on small business or small government jurisdictions.As a result, an initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis was not prepared.Paperwork Reduction Act This proposed rule contains a collection of information requirement subjectto the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act (Pub. L. No. 96-511).The collection of information requirement applies to persons seeking permitsto conduct otherwise prohibited activities and is necessary to determinewhether the proposed activities are consistent with the management goalsfor the sanctuary. The collection of information requirement containedin the proposed rule has been submitted to the Office of Management andBudget for review under section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act.The public reporting burden per respondent for the collection of informationcontained in this rule is estimated to average 1.75 hours annually. Thisestimate includes the time for reviewing instructions, searching existingdata sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and and completingand reviewing the collection of information. Comments from the public onthe collection of information requirement are specifically invited andshould be addressed to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs,Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC, 20530; and to RichardRoberts, Room 305, 601 Executive Boulevard, Rockville, DC, 20852. Executive Order 12612 This proposed rule does not contain policies with sufficient Federalismimplications to warrant preparation of a Federalism assessment under ExecutiveOrder 12612. National Environmental Policy Act In accordance with section 304(a)(2) of the Act (16 U.S.C. 1434(a)(2))and the provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42U.S.C. 4321-4370(a)), a draft environmental impact statement has been preparedfor the proposed designation and the proposed regulations. As requiredby section 304(a)(2), the draft environmental impact statement includesthe resource assessment report required by section 303(b)(3) of the Act(16 U.S.C. 1433(b)(3)), maps depicting the boundaries of the proposed designatedarea, and the existing and potential uses and resources of the area. Copiesof the draft environmental impact statement are available upon requestto the Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management at the address listedabove.Executive Order 12630This proposed rule, if issued in final form as proposed, would not haveany takings implications within the meaning of Executive Order 12630 becauseit would not appear to have an effect on private property sufficientlysevere as to effectively deny economically viable use of any of any distinctlegally potential property interest to its owner or to have the effectof, or result in, a permanent or temporary physical occupation, invasion,or deprivation.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 15 CFR Part 943</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Environmental protection, Marineresources, Natural resources.<ITAG tagnum="6">Thomas J.
