Charles Bofferding, president of the Seattle ProfessionalEngineering Employees Association, said members of the professionalunit voted by 69 percent to reject their contract offer but alsovoted 52 percent against authorizing negotiators to call a strike.   It was the first time in the unaffiliated union's history thatengineers and scientists rejected a contract offer, he said. Theunion consists of nearly 9,300 of 15,200 affected Boeing scientistsand engineers.   About 8,300 of Boeing's nearly 12,800 technical and supportworkers belong to the technical workers unit. Almost all of thosecovered by both contracts are in the Puget Sound area.   Leaders of the engineers union will contact Boeing officialsimmediately about returning to the table, Bofferding said.   ``We are critical parts of the Boeing team, and we affect themin all areas,'' he said.   Bofferding said the voting rate for both units exceeded 80percent, a record. The unions vote by mail.   The offers included general pay hikes totaling 3 percent forengineers and 7 percent for the lower-paid technicians.   Bofferding said he believed the main factor in the engineers'rejection was the belief that the money package was too smallcompared with that won by Boeing production workers in a 48-daystrike that ended last month.   The Machinists' three-year pact includes pay increases of 4percent the first year, 3 percent the next two years; productivitybonuses of 10 percent, 5 percent and 4 percent of annual gross pay;and a boost in the cost-of-living formula from 86 percent ofinflation to nearly 100 percent.   The offer to engineers, who now make an average of nearly$40,000 a year, called for a 3 percent wage increase and aproductivity bonus of 10 percent of gross pay in the first year andno further general increases.</TEXT></DOC>
