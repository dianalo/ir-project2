They may have to come up with a new maxim. With the U.S.now in a recession, Korea appears largely unaffected.Government and private forecasters expect economic growththis year of about 8%, and the nation's world-wide exportsare forecast to increase 9% in dollar terms.</LP><TEXT>   To be sure, economic growth is down from the double-digitexpansions recorded between 1986 and 1988, and deeply rootedeconomic problems persist. But the Korean economy remainsstrong. Says Kim Chong In, senior economic adviser toPresident Roh Tae Woo, &quot;The economic performance will bebetter than we expected at the beginning of the year.&quot;   That's because Korean manufacturers have shown remarkableskill in developing new products and adding higher-valuefeatures to existing ones. For example, TriGem Computer Inc.,a maker of personal computers, predicts its U.S. sales willclimb 50% this year, mainly because it will begin shipping a$10,000 laptop workstation. Still, says Kim Do Jin, executivedirector for international sales, &quot;We feel affected by the(U.S.) recession in the sense that we could have grown muchfaster.&quot;   Many Korean exporters are weaning themselves fromdependence on the U.S. market. Shipments to the U.S. lastyear accounted for less than 30% of total exports, comparedwith 33% in 1989 and 35% in 1988, according to governmentfigures.   Slumping auto sales in the U.S. are hurting U.S., Japaneseand Korean auto makers alike. But Hyundai Motor Co., whichbuilds cars at a sprawling plant in the southern city ofUlsan, expects worldwide exports to expand 20% this year,despite slower growth in U.S. sales.   &quot;We have been putting efforts into new markets that willeventually reduce our dependence on the U.S.,&quot; says Hyundai'sexport director, Kim Noi Myong. Hyundai also plans to ship anew model, the Elantra, to compete with the Toyota Corollaand Honda Civic in the U.S.   But though Korea is proving its mettle in the exportsector, economists warn of longer-term problems. Many Koreanproducts still trail U.S., Japanese and European competitorsin quality and technology. The nation's antiquated andprotected banking system, as well as interest rates as highas 25%, frustrate companies looking for financing. Highinflation and a languishing stock market are also majorconcerns.   But overall, economists say, the Korean economy is movingin the right direction, and with considerable momentum.Executives who only two years ago blamed their troubles onunion wage demands now concede that the nation's exportslowdown in the late 1980s was caused largely by technologyand quality problems. Now, Korean companies are scurrying toimprove products and factory automation.   As a result, imports of machinery and other capitalequipment have surged, causing concern about Korea'scurrent-account deficit, which is expected to widen to asmuch as $3 billion this year from $1.8 billion in 1990.Economists say that in the long run, however, capital importswill only bolster economic performance.   The investments already are paying off. TriGem recentlysurprised the industry with its new laptop workstation, whichuses the newest-generation chips. The workstations will beavailable just as similar models from Japan come tomarketrare timing for a Korean company.   TriGem, which spends 8% of its sales on research anddevelopment, says its exports will more than double this yearto $250 million of computers and peripherals. At $10,000each, the laptop workstation will generate the same revenueto TriGem as 20 of the personal computers that have been itsmainstay.   Matching Japanese and Western manufacturers is crucial forKorean companies because most of their products no longerenjoy a significant price advantage. Korean companies remainvulnerable to currency fluctuations. But exporters have beencheered by the won's depreciation against the dollar, whichhas made their goods more price-competitive in the U.S.   Meantime, Korean companies have aggressively sought newexport markets. For instance, Kukje Corp., a major maker ofathletic shoes for such companies as Nike Inc., ReebokInternational Ltd. and L.A. Gear Inc., expects Europe's shareof the company's exports to increase to 20% this year from10% in 1990, while the U.S. share declines to 60% from 70%.Exports to the U.S., in volume terms, will be flat, but areexpected to rise 20% in value because Kukje is making higherpriced products.   Samsung Electronics Co. says it has reduced its dependenceon the U.S. market to only 27% of exports of its consumerelectronics from 40% in 1989. &quot;We are expecting to exportmore to Europe than to the U.S. this year,&quot; says Kim Hun,senior managing director for trade affairs.   Eastern Europe, too, has provided new sources of business.Kolon Industries Inc. forecasts that sales of its textilesand fibers in eastern Europe will jump 29% this year from1990, when exports increased 27%. The company's easternEuropean sales are expected to account for 10% of the totalthis year.   Hyundai shipped 9,000 cars to Yugoslavia last year andwill ship at least 10,000 this year. It even sent a fewhundred to Bulgaria and is planning a sales push in Germanythis year. &quot;I doubt it compensates for the U.S.,&quot; saysHyundai's Mr. Kim. &quot;But it is of great help.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
