The Sandinista National Liberation Front on Thursday issued acommunique shortly after the Senate vote, saying its members``repudiate the approval of these new funds by the U.S. Congressfor the mercenary forces.''   ``This has violated one more time the rights and the order ofinternational justice and makes fun of the will of the CentralAmerican presidents expressed in the document of Costa del Sol, ElSalvador, on Feb. 14.''   After a two-day meeting at a resort outside the capital of SanSalvador, the presidents of El Salvador, Nicaragua, Guatemala,Costa Rica and Honduras agreed to come up with a plan by mid-May todismantle the rebel force.   Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega also promised to push fordemocratic reforms in his country and moved up elections by 10months, to February 1990.   The statement, signed by the front's nine commanders, called thehumanitarian aid package ``threats by the U.S. government to applynew forms of force'' against the leftist government.   The aid package was harshly criticized by the Sandinista partyand Ortega. President Bush first unveiled the bipartisan plan toprovide non-lethal aid to the estimated 11,000 Contra rebels whohave been living with their families in Honduran border camps sinceCongress cut off military aid in February 1988.   Ortega has charged any kind of aid to the Contras interfereswith regional peace efforts.</TEXT></DOC>
