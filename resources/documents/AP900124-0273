(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A defense contractor reimbursed executiveswho attended a $500-a-plate fund-raiser for Alexander Haig'spresidential campaign in 1987, the company's founder said in courtdocuments.   Corporations cannot legally contribute directly or indirectly topresidential campaigns.   James Guerin, founder of International Signal andamp; Control Corp.,made the allegation in a deposition filed Tuesday in an employmentdispute with his former chief attorney. The dinner raised some$26,000 for Haig.   The deposition said the former chief attorney, William A. Clark,had told Guerin and other top ISC officials he felt thecontributions were illegal, the deposition said.   Guerin, in his sworn testimony, gave no further details aboutthe alleged reimbursements.   There was no indication in the documents that Haig, secretary ofstate under President Reagan, White House chief of staff underPresidents Nixon and Ford and former NATO supreme commander, wasaware of the alleged arrangement between ISC and its executives.   ``I can certainly say that we are shocked and surprised and knowabsolutely nothing about what was alleged,'' Woody Goldberg, aspokesman for Haig, said from Washington today. ``We wouldn't knowand certainly have no knowledge about this whatsoever.''   Goldberg said Haig was out of town and could not be reached.   News reports at the time of the dinner quoted an ISC spokesmanas saying the company had a keen interest in Haig and felt hispresidency would benefit the company.   A year earlier, Haig had worked as a consultant to ISC andhelped negotiate a deal to sell missiles to the Pakistanigovernment of the late Gen. Mohammed Zia ul-Haq, Guerin said.   Guerin later sold ISC to the London-based Ferranti InternationalPLC for $670 million in Ferranti stock.   In the employment dispute, Clark claimed Guerin paid him only $1million of a promised $2.75 million settlement ending Clark'sfive-year association with Guerin. Guerin countered that Clark usedcoercion and extortion to secure the agreement.</TEXT></DOC>
