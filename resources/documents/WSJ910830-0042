The agreement with Sony Corp., Fujitsu Ltd. and HitachiLtd., which was expected, is significant because it marks aU.S. maker's entry at the early stages of development in whatcould be a large consumer electronics market. Still, thecompanies must wait several years for a payoff from HDTV,which is in its infancy.</LP><TEXT>   The four companies will co-develop integrated circuitsaround an HDTV standard called Muse using digital signalprocessing circuits from Fujitsu, analog processing fromSony, audio circuits from Hitachi and frame memory circuitsfrom TI. The HDTV chip set will be completed during the firstquarter of 1992, TI said.</TEXT></DOC>
