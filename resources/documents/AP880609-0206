The Massachusetts governor also attended Harvard University'scommencement, took his wife home from the hospital where she hadspinal surgery six days ago and spent several hours catching up onstate business.   Dukakis, meanwhile, came under attack from Republican GeorgeBush, who spoke to Republicans at a Texas state convention inHouston. Bush attacked the Massachusetts governor for``old-style...60's liberalism'' whose views are ``out of themainstream.''   ``It's clear that the vice president doesn't think that his ownrecord or vision can bring him the votes he needs in November,''retorted Dukakis spokesman Leslie Dach.   Dukakis was speaking at a Thursday night victory partycelebrating his Tuesday primary victories clinching enoughdelegates to assure his nomination. Dukakis' campaign, meanwhile,continued a low-key search for a running mate amid quietpreparations for the Democratic National Convention in July.   Dukakis, who has been critical of Reagan administration CentralAmerica policies, told reporters after meeting with Arias that ifelected he would ``develop a new relationship based on repect''with the region's leaders.   ``We did have an opportunity once again to talk about concernsthat he has and I have and all of us have about Central America,about his leadership in bringing peace to the region and about theopportunity economically for development,'' said Dukakis, who helda similar meeting with Arias several months ago.   Arias, in Boston to deliver a commencement address at Harvard,laughed when asked if he would endorse Dukakis for president. Hesaid he would ``do business with whoever you decide to send to theWhite House.''   He then referred to Dukakis' fluent Spanish and said, ``Perhapsit's easier, we can get along in the same language. That helps.''   Dukakis, speaking in Spanish to a television reporter travelingwith Arias, said efforts to remove Panama's Gen. Manuel AntonioNoriega from power should be centered on negotiations that involveCentral American leaders.   The governor said the Reagan administration has failed toconsult with Arias and other leaders in the region during effortsto persuade Noriega, who is under U.S. indictment on drug charges,to step down.   At Massachusetts General Hospital, Dukakis stood by as his wife,Kitty, thanked the hospital's doctors and staff for caring for herduring her hospitalization after surgery to repair herniated discsin her neck.   Mrs. Dukakis said her doctors told her she could remove her neckbrace by next month when her husband formally accepts thenomination at the Democratic convention.   Outside the hospital, Dukakis smiled and refused to answer whenasked to comment on Jesse Jackson's assertion that he deserved tobe offered the No. 2 spot on the Democratic ticket because of hisstrong performance in the primaries. On Wednesday, Dukakis saidJackson deserved consideration but not a guaranteed offer.   While Dukakis spent the afternoon at his Statehouse office,campaign aides met to discuss strategy for weekend meetings inMichigan where work is to begin on drafting the party's electionplatform, a process that will involve negotiations with the Jacksoncampaign. Deputy campaign manager Jack Corrigan will lead Dukakis'delegation to the meetings, bringing with him most of thecampaign's top issues advisers.   Dukakis is to work at the Statehouse on Friday and attend theMassachusetts Democratic Convention on Saturday. On Sunday he is toaddress the nation's mayors at a national conference in Salt LakeCity. Dukakis will focus on the nation's drug problems and theireffect on families, campaign aides said.   Several members of Congress are scheduled to visit with Dukakisearly next week before he heads to the South for three days ofcampaigning.</TEXT></DOC>
