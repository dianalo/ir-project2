Investment bankers and other buyout specialists say they may be in for rough sledding.    These companies aren't likely to meet their projections for planned asset sales, at least in the near future. Many had planned quick asset sales in order to make big debt repayments in the next two years.    Four examples include a pending buy-out of Southland Corp.; Burlington Holdings Inc., which completed a leveraged buy-out of Burlington Industries Inc. in September; Borg-Warner Holdings Corp., which completed a buy-out of Borg-Warner Corp. in July; and Fruehauf Corp.    Southland Corp.   Investors are so anxious about the pending buy-out of the Dallas-based operator of 7-Eleven Stores that some officials of Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., one of the company's investment bankers, has tagged the transaction &quot;the Texas chain store massacre.&quot;    A junk bond offering to help finance the Southland transaction has been in the works for months. But Goldman Sachs and Salomon Brothers Inc., the co-underwriters, have delayed the proposed $1.5 billion offering because of softness in the junk bond market. Some junk bond analysts say that the bonds may have to be offered with so high a yield as to make it harder for the company to make principal and interest payments.    Southland would have about $4.89 billion of debt after the buy-out is completed. The company plans to pay off about $1 billion of that by the end of 1989, largely from the sale of assets. Southland expects proceeds from asset sales to total $867 million by the end of next year.    However, investment bankers say that because of the depressed stock market, owners of leveraged companies will be able to fetch only a portion of the prices they hope to get for asset sales. &quot;You can knock off at least 20 cents on the dollar on asset sales compared to three weeks ago,&quot; says one investment banker.    Potential buyers of Southland's dairy operations say that Southland had counted on fetching about $325 million for the unit. But most bids have been under $250 million, potential buyers said.    Southland declined comment.    Burlington Industries Inc.   Burlington's new owners -- a Morgan Stanley andamp; Co.-led group -- may get about five-eighths of their asking prices for assets if they sell in this environment, says W. Clay Hamner, managing director and chief executive officer of Montrose Capital Corp., a Durham, N.C.-based investment concern active in the textile industry. &quot;They certainly won't get those prices they were demanding,&quot; he adds.    The Greensboro, N.C.-based textile concern was taken private in a $2.16 billion buy-out in September. Donald Brennan, head of Morgan Stanley's leveraged buy-out efforts, says interest &quot;couldn't be keener&quot; in Burlington's assets, and that the company plans to meet its projections without any problem.    Mr. Brennan acknowledges that the prices of the about $1 billion in bonds that helped finance the transaction have dropped sharply in recent weeks, reflecting investor uncertainty. But he says that Burlington has been &quot;unfairly tagged as an asset sale deal.&quot; He adds that the company could pay its $3.63 billion debt largely on the basis of cash flow, which he says is stronger than Morgan Stanley initially anticipated.    But in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing in August, Burlington said it didn't expect to generate enough cash from operations to make estimated payments to bank lenders of $650 million next June and $250 million in June 1989.    Burlington's buy-out was considered overpriced at the time by many in the textile industry.    Even amid the stock market boom and economic optimism, many in the industry predicted that Burlington would have a hard time both handling its debt and making ongoing capital investments necessary to compete. Moreover, they noted, a series of unsuccessful textile leveraged buy-outs didn't bode well for the future of the nation's largest textile concern.    &quot;We're working with several potential buyers who are interested, but the prices envisioned will be somewhat less than they (Burlington's owners) want,&quot; said Earl Philips, president of High Point, N.C.-based First Factors Corp. &quot;I see no decline in interest. But all this uncertainty in the market has reduced the prospective value of everything.&quot;    With the industry concerned about recession, buyers may be looking askance at a number of Burlington's apparel fabrics businesses, which are vulnerable to imports. The company's carpet business is also recession-sensitive, and the profitability of that business has been slashed industrywide by the cost of introducing new stain-resistant brands.    Burlington last night sold its Erwin, N.C., denim plant to Dominion Textile Inc., the Montreal-based concern that unsuccessfully bid for Burlington, for $205 million, an individual familiar with the transaction said.    &quot;Dominion wasn't willing to pay what it might have offered four weeks ago,&quot; says an individual close to the company.    The denim operation hadn't been on the list of assets for sale that Burlington announced last month. Burlington had said it would sell nearly all of its industrial products group, including its precision, glass and industrial fabrics units, and a Ramseur, N.C., blended fabrics plant.    Denim has been among the company's most profitable operations. While Burlington still has two other domestic denim plants, some analysts had speculated that Burlington would first try to sell its least profitable assets, rather than those that contribute most to the bottom line.    Borg-Warner Corp.   The company, analysts say, could be a troublesome purchase for its owners -- a group led by Merrill Lynch Capital Partners -- because it, too, must sell assets. And its main line of business -- automotive parts -- is considered vulnerable in a recession.    Merrill Lynch officials say that the company is so far meeting its goals. Last month, Borg-Warner agreed to sell its Borg-Warner Acceptance Corp. unit to Transamerica Corp. for $782.5 million. &quot;We are well beyond the debt pay-down schedule for 1987 and are in good shape for the next five quarters,&quot; says a Merrill Lynch official.    Robert Long, director of high-yield research at First Boston Corp., says that the sale of Borg-Warner's commercial finance unit was &quot;good but not sufficient&quot; if Borg-Warner is to make the $1.43 billion debt repayment that will be required in the second year after the buy-out.    Fruehauf Corp.   The company, taken private last year by its management and Merrill Lynch, also concerns analysts. Public documents indicate that the company's earnings are far behind projections, largely because of continuing softness in the trailer and container businesses -- its principal lines.    Last month, after the crash, Fruehauf announced it would embark on a &quot;second wave&quot; of divestitures to pare its $878 million debt by as much as $180 million in the next 12 to 18 months.    That debt alone is more than what Fruehauf is probably worth, figures Richard Bilotti, a bond analyst at L.F. Rothschild andamp; Co. Mr. Bilotti says &quot;I'd be surprised if the entire company is worth much more than $700 million.&quot;    Robert D. Rowan, chairman and chief executive officer of Fruehauf, said that he believes the company will be able to continue its interest payments on schedule. He adds that the company is &quot;ahead of schedule on our bank payments,&quot; and that there are &quot;55 companies interested in buying&quot; Fruehauf's Canadian division. </TEXT></DOC>
