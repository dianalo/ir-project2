Contaminated soilmay be plowed and sprayed with nutrients, for example, to stimulate thegrowth of bacteria that destroy a certain toxin. The results of suchcleanup efforts have been rather unpredictable, however, since both thegenetic variables and the environmental conditions that influence themare not well understood. Now efforts are under way to study in more detailhow environmental processes are controlled at the genetic level in microorganisms,especially bacteria. These pioneering efforts represent the first stagein the creation of a new scientific approach, called genetic ecology.Although still in its infancy, genetic ecology appears to hold greatpotential for leading to better ways of destroying toxic wastes wherethey lie, in both land and water. Other potential applications rangefrom enhancing the biological gasification of coal while it is stillin the ground to preventing microbially induced corrosion of condensertubing in power plants. 1 reference.</TEXT></DOC>
