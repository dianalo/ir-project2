Phase I trials are designed to determine a product's toxicity, not its medical effectiveness.    The biotechnology concern said that, pending FDA approval, it expects to begin the tests on its tissue plasminogen activator in the third quarter this year.    Last week, an FDA advisory panel rejected at least temporarily Genentech Inc.'s bid to license a tissue plasminogen activator. That delay for Genentech has given hope to other biotechnology concerns that they will be able to gain ground with their own research in the field. </TEXT></DOC>
