(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Anti-nuclear activists fromGreenpeace USA will try to halt the launch of a Trident 2 missilefrom a submarine off the Florida coast, which they said isscheduled Friday, a spokeswoman said Tuesday.   ``Coming on the eve of the Mediterranean summit, this test is aslap in the face to the world's hopes and expectations formeaningful arms reductions,'' said Greenpeace spokeswoman ShannonFagan.   President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev meetSaturday and Sunday off the island of Malta in the Mediterranean.   The Navy refused to confirm or deny that it planned a Trident 2launch Friday.   Greenpeace was successful in stopping a Trident 2 test from thenuclear submarine Tennessee last July 28, maneuvering small Zodiacrafts close enough to the sub to attach ``Nuclear Free Seas'' flagsto its hull and mast.   The anti-nuclear activists left the area, declaring they hadmade their point that the Trident 2 should be eliminated as aweapons system, and the Navy was able to launch the missile fivedays later.   That was the only success in three submarine test-launches. Theother two ended in explosions just seconds after the missilescleared the ocean surface.   In Washington, a government source said the Bush administrationmight delay the test until after the summit. ``Discussions aregoing on as to whether to delay it until after Malta,'' said onesource who spoke on condition of anonymity.   The Trident 2, at $26.5 million a copy, is designed to replacethe Trident 1 submarine-launched ballistic missiles. Each44-foot-long, three-stage Trident 2 can deliver as many as 12nuclear warheads to individual targets up to 6,000 miles away.</TEXT></DOC>
