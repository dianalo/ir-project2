At diagnosis, patients ranged inage from 1-65 years (median 19 years) and the most common tumor (in 30)was astrocytoma. Radiation doses ranged from 45 to 81.3 Gy (median 56.8Gy). White matter changes visible on MR were graded on a scale of 1-4,with grades 1-2 known to occur in some normal patients. Areas of increasedsignal intensity not associated with the tumor or surgery were visiblein all patients (gr 1 = 37%, gr 2 = 32%, gr 3 = 17%, gr 4 = 15%) whereasonly 35% had regions of abnormality (hypodensity) on CT. Sulci enlargementand ventricular abnormalities (asymmetry or dilatation) were presentin approximately 50% of patients by each technique. Higher grade MR lesionswere associated with radiation to large volumes and high doses. For the36 patients treated with 1.5-2.0 Gy daily fractions, the mean radiationdose by grade was as follows: gr 1 = 55.1 Gy, gr 2 = 58.8 Gy, gr 3 =60.0 Gy, gr 4 = 63.5 Gy. All 5 patients treated on a hyperfractionatedschedule had gr 1-2 changes despite receiving greater than 70 Gy. Fiftypercent of patients treated to the whole brain (+/- boost) had gr 3-4changes, compared with 14% treated with local fields (peak dose regionssimilar in both groups). Among the children (less than or equal to 13years), 20% had gr 3-4 changes compared with 56% of adults (excludinghyperfractionated patients). This finding may be due entirely or in partto the lower radiation doses used for children (mean 54.4 Gy vs. 63.7Gy in adults). Clinical abnormalities attributable to irradiation includedan impairment in mental functioning in 7 adults, and learning disabilitiesin 5 children.</TEXT></DOC>
