Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammed Nabi also said 250guerrillas were killed in other fighting. His claims could not beindependently verified.   The Soviet ambassador to Afghanistan meanwhile reportedthousands of casualties by both sides in the seven-week siege onJalalabad, and he compared the intense shelling to that of theWorld War II battle of Stalingrad.   Yuli M. Vorontsov also said the offensive appears to have beenorchestrated entirely by the Pakistani military, not by thegovernment of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.   ``I don't think she's looking for a military solution,''Vorontsov said. ``I think she wants peace and quiet in Afghanistan.The Pakistani military has some thing else in mind. They wantpeople who are going to be very obedient to Pakistan.''   According to a report in The New York Times on Sunday, Ms.Bhutto's government ordered the frontal assault on Jalalabad lastmonth despite opposition from Pakistan's military intelligenceservicee. The newspaper said the decision was made in the presenceof the U.S. ambassador to Pakistan, Robert Oakley. It said noresistance leaders were at the meeting.   Islamabad has denied the allegations, and Washington has refusedcomment.   President Najib frequently has accused Pakistan, its easternneighbor, of armed aggression and interference in his country.   ``I think it was entirely a plot of the Pakistani military,''Vorontsov said in an interview in the Soviet Embassy compound.   Guerrillas fired a rocket into the compound Thursday, and theexplosion shattered windows but caused no casualties among the 260people staying there.   ``If there is a second one,'' Vorontsov warned, ``they will besorry.''   ``We will reply swiftly and decisively,'' he said. ``Our replyis ready and it won't be in a diplomatic note.''   The guerrillas, who are armed and supported by the UnitedStates, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and China, began fighting tooverthrow the pro-Soviet government shortly after it seized powerin a 1978 coup.   The Soviet Union sent soldiers to support the government in1979. More than 100,000 soldiers were in the country beforeAfghanistan, Pakistan, the United States and the Soviet Unionsigned a U.N.-sponsored agreement.   On March 6, three weeks after the last Soviet soldiers leftAfghanistan, the insurgents launched the attack on Jalalabad, about45 miles from the border with Pakistan.   Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani said governmentsoldiers had inflicted heavy blows to the guerrillas in theirlatest attack.   He said 58 guerrillas were killed and 49 others wounded sinceMonday night. One soldier also was killed and six civiliansinjured, he said.   Elsewhere, the military killed 250 guerrillas and wounded 300others in fighting in the southern city of Kandahar and twocivilians died and six others were injured in the western city ofHerat, he said.   According to Vorontsov, Jalalabad has been hit by tens ofthousands of rockets since the siege began. He said officials hadcalculated the rate of shelling was comparable to the battle ofStalingrad.   He said more than 5,000 guerrillas have been killed and aboutanother 3,500 have been injured.   He also said about 2,500 soldiers had been killed or wounded andthat the that the casualties among civilians also have been high,although he did not have any figures.   ``If their aim is to find a place for their so-calledgovernment, they're not going to do it there,'' he said.   The resistance in February formed an interim government inPakistan. Capturing Jalalabad would give them a base on Afghan soil.   Vorontsov said he plans to continue contacts with withresistance leaders in Pakistan and Iran to reach a negotiatedsettlement. He said the issue would be brought up during Secretaryof State James Baker III's trip to Moscow next month.   ``What surprises me is the line of the American adminstration,''he said. ``In other parts of the world, they are interested in apolitical solution. Why are they playing another ball game here?''</TEXT></DOC>
