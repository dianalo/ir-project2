The company, which went private in 1984 in a leveraged buyout valued at about $96 million, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission an initial public offering of 4.5 million common shares. That represents about 31% of the company's shares. The company estimates the share price will be between $15 and $18, which suggests that in a little more than three years, the value of the company has more than doubled.    Proceeds to the company will be used to reduce debt.    The 1984 leveraged buyout was led by Forstmann Little andamp; Co., a closely held investment firm, and included 10 members of Topps' management. The group paid $26.25 a share for the company's 3.6 million common shares.    Of the 4.5 million shares to be offered, 3.5 million will be sold by current shareholders, according to a Topps spokesman.    Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. and Alex. Brown andamp; Sons Inc. will co-manage the offering. </TEXT></DOC>
