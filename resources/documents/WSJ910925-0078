Six of the 10 companies with the largest number ofinsiders buying shares in recent months were newly publiccompanies, according to filings received at the Securitiesand Exchange Commission from June 1 through Sept. 15.</LP><TEXT>   The buying by corporate executives, directors and majorshareholders at companies that recently went public is areversal from previous patterns. Insiders, particularly theventure capitalists that helped launch a company, often usean IPO as an opportunity to sell stock.   But with a slew of IPOs on the market, company executivessay institutional investors want to see management risk itsown money on the new ventures. Insider buying, they add,helps distinguish one new company from the scores of others.   &quot;If you have deals where&quot; the founders or the financialbackers of a company &quot;aren't liquefying at all, that'ssignificant,&quot; said William H. Miller III, president of LeggMason Fund Advisor of Baltimore.   Altogether, 220 companies have gone public so far thisyear, raising $9.3 billion, according to Securities DataCorp., up from 152 companies raising $4.3 billion in the sameperiod last year.   Insiders at IPOs are keenly aware that their stocktransactions are carefully watched.   &quot;It was important&quot; to institutional investors andunderwriters &quot;that none of us sold,&quot; said Robert Emmons,chairman of Smart andamp; Final Inc., a Santa Barbara, Calif.,chain of wholesale grocery stores that went public July 30.&quot;They considered that to be an important element&quot; in theoffering.   At the same time, the fact that &quot;officers and employeeswere buying stock was viewed very positively,&quot; said Dr.Emmons. He bought 100,000 shares of the newly public companyfor $1.9 million on Aug. 6.   Eleven other Smart andamp; Final insiders also bought sharesthat day, according to SEC filings. They paid $19 a share;the stock has since eased, closing yesterday at $18, up 12.5cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.   &quot;There were a lot of IPOs coming out in June,&quot; said UrlinHarris, chief financial officer of State Auto FinancialCorp., a Columbus, Ohio, holding company that went publicJune 26.   To differentiate itself, three teams of company officials&quot;put on a road show&quot; for institutional investors, employeesand the company's insurance agents in 17 states. At oneluncheon, Mr. Harris said, an institutional investorexpressed surprise that insiders weren't selling stock intothe IPO.   &quot;One thing we were trying to do is provide a level playingfield,&quot; Mr. Harris said, and &quot;if we paid the same price asthey did,&quot; for State Auto shares, that goal would be met.   Twenty-two insiders at State Auto bought shares at thetime of the initial public offering or shortly thereafter,most of them buying about 1,000 shares each at $13.50 ashare. Mr. Harris bought 3,000 shares, SEC filings show. Inover-the-counter trading, the stock closed yesterday at$13.50, down 50 cents.   So far, most of the insider bulls at State Auto and othercompanies that have recently gone public have broken even, ormade a paper profit, SEC filings show. Most of them benefitedfrom a blip higher in share price that typically takes placeafter an IPO.   But the new-issue market can be highly sensitive. Shareprices often retreat after the initial flurry of activity.   Consider Exel Ltd., an insurer based in Hamilton, Bermuda,that went public July 18. While some institutionalshareholders sold into the offering, 13 insiders boughtshares at or immediately after it, SEC filings show. Theypaid $25.50 a share, and the price has since risen sharply.In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Exel sharesclosed yesterday at $31.625. However, Exel's stock price wasdown $2.125 yesterday, 6%, on the company's report that netincome for the third quarter ended Aug. 30 was 97 cents ashare, compared to $1.12 in the year-earlier quarter.   Some bullish insiders who've profited handsomely, at leaston paper, include the eight officers and directors ofFisher-Price Inc. who purchased its shares on the open marketwhen the toy company was spun off from Quaker Oats Co. inJuly, SEC filings show. The insiders paid an average price of$23.56 a share for a total of 17,600 shares. Yesterday,Fisher-Price closed on the Big Board at $28.125, down 50cents.   Similarly, eight insiders at Duracell International Inc.purchased stock in the battery manufacturer as part of itsMay 2 initial public offering, SEC filings show. In total,they bought 576,050 shares for about $8.6 million, accordingto the filings. The stock of the Bethel, Conn., company hasrisen sharply since the insiders' $15-a-share purchases. InNew York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Duracellshares closed at $28.875, down 37.5 cents.</TEXT></DOC>
