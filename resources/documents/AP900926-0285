J2, a Los Angeles-based home video producer and distributor,said it was mailing proxy material to shareholders of bothcompanies this week. The shareholders will vote on the offer atspecial meetings scheduled for Oct. 24.   Under a previous agreement, National Lampoon shareholders wereto receive two thirds of a share of J2 common stock for every shareof National Lampoon, plus a warrant to purchase an additional shareat $3.75. Under the new agreement, the warrant price will be $3.25.   Jimirro, a former Walt Disney Co. executive, said J2 hopes tobreathe new life into the New York-based National Lampoon magazine,which has lost money for a decade. J2 also hopes to cross-marketthe National Lampoon name, made familiar through National Lampoon'smovie and TV operations in Los Angeles.   ``Look at Disney,'' Jimirro said. ``What Disney does is fullyexploit franchises, and the Lampoon is a franchise in the samesense Disney is, except on a smaller scale.''   He said he hopes to create ``synergies'' through mutuallypromoting projects in radio, television, film, merchandise, comedyclubs and even satirical reviews on Broadway.</TEXT></DOC>
