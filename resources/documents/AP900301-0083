Yilma Kassaye, the relief and rehabilitation commissioner,estimated the cost of the airlift and trucking operation at $14million a month, above the cost of the food.   The United Nations estimates that 1.1 million tons of food willbe required to feed 4 million drought victims in danger of starvingin the northern provinces of Eritrea, Tigre, Wollo and Gondor inthe next six months.   The United Nations had planned to ship most of the food throughthe Red Sea port of Massawa, but it was closed last month byrenewed fighting between the government and the secessionistEritrean People's Liberation Front.   Kassaye said food could be shipped to Ethiopia's only other portat Assab, near the border with Djibouti, and trucked and flown tothe affected areas.   The government and a second rebel group which has controlledTigre for nearly a year have agreed to allow church groups todistribute food there.</TEXT></DOC>
