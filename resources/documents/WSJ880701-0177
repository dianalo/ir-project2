Since under the VOA charter, editorials are required to represent the views of the U.S. government -- which currently means the Reagan administration -- one is tempted to dismiss this bizarre complaint as the consequence of sheer ignorance. But surely Mr. Gartner cannot be that ignorant of VOA operations. Or can he? Elsewhere in his column he writes that &quot;historically the Voice sent out noncontroversial fare -- straight news and music and current affairs. But the Reagan administration added editorials in 1982, giving Americans a reason to monitor the broadcasts.&quot;    This is the heart of Mr. Gartner's complaint: that the Reagan administration, with its editorials, has introduced something unique and sinister into VOA, something that threatens the integrity and independence of the rest of its programming.    In fact, VOA editorials were around long before the election of Ronald Reagan. During the Carter administration, for example, they were called &quot;commentaries&quot; and were described in October 1978 by then-VOA Director R. Peter Straus as &quot;concise presentations of U.S. Government policies . . . designed solely to present the U.S. Government point of view.&quot; Another Carter-era VOA official noted, in January 1980, that these &quot;Commentaries will no longer limit themselves to mere statements of U.S. foreign policy, but will serve to advocate such policy, using the gamut of appropriate journalistic devices, including discussion of alternative or opposing views as 'straw men' to support ultimately the policy's validity.&quot;    While VOA editorial writers today do not use the &quot;straw man&quot; technique, the editorials still reflect the views of the U.S. government. Is Mr. Gartner really unaware of the fact that VOA editorials did not start with the Reagan administration in 1982? Or has he, like so many others, suddenly discovered an objection to the editorials because he doesn't like the policies they currently represent? If so wouldn't it have been refreshing if he'd been honest enough to just say so.    Richard W. Carlson   Director, Voice of America   U.S. Information Agency   Washington   ---   I'm one of the editorial-writing &quot;zealots&quot; at the VOA who, according to Mr. Gartner, acts as a &quot;direct mouthpiece of Ronald Reagan.&quot; In fact, I'm the longest-serving mouthpiece around. Mr. Gartner's dark description of VOA editorials, so far divorced from the reality of my job for the past four years, provokes a personal reply.    Mr. Gartner has filed suit challenging the laws under which USIA, VOA's parent agency, prohibits domestic dissemination of VOA product. According to him, the law has gone unchallenged because historically VOA broadcast &quot;noncontroversial fare,&quot; but the addition of editorials six years ago gave &quot;Americans a reason to monitor the broadcasts.&quot; No one wishes a repeal of these rules more than those who write VOA editorials, if for no other reason, to quiet insinuations of their evil nature. We receive no secret instructions from the National Security Council or State Department; mainly, like editorial writers everywhere, we read the papers, kibitz among ourselves, and try to come up with newsworthy topics we think are both important and interesting to our audience. Of course -- like Mr. Gartner's editorials in the Ames Daily Tribune -- we reflect the views of management. In our case, that's the U.S. government.    If Mr. Gartner gets his wish to wade through six years of VOA editorials, he may find a big surprise -- agreeing with most of them. For we think our enterprise, like our government's, is founded on a &quot;decent respect for the opinions of mankind.&quot; That respect for our audience, most of them denied a free media in their own countries, means we argue forcefully for U.S. views but respect the ability of our listeners to make up their own minds. Our pieces are reviewed by Foreign Service officers, and there is occasional tension between the demands of diplomacy and those of journalism. But with rare exception, few officials have tried to use VOA editorials as a &quot;direct mouthpiece.&quot;    VOA editorials explain principles as well as promote policies: how democracy works, why free markets produce prosperity, why we think all men have inalienable rights. We zealots of VOA lobby for human rights in Chile as well as Czechoslovakia, upsetting friendly governments as well as hostile ones. For instance, one Asian government took strong exception to an editorial that criticized its restrictions on circulation of The Asian Wall Street Journal.    My job -- writing editorials that legally can't be sent to Mom, in prose plain enough to be translated into 44 languages -- may not be everyone's idea of fun. But there are those of us who think it important for people abroad to understand our country's views. And perhaps as long as the U.S. taxpayer is footing the bill for 1,204 hours each week of news and entertainment, it's not unreasonable to include an occasional word from the sponsor.
