The International Institute for Strategic Studies also raiseddoubts about whether Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev willsucceed with his reforms, or even survive.   ``While skepticism about Gorbachev's sincerity was subsidingamong Western leaders, questions about his ability to succeed, andeven to stay in power, abound,'' said the report.   ``Open opposition and challenges have been replaced withgrumbling beneath the surface,'' it said. ``This does notnecessarily make Gorbachev's situation any less dangerous.''   Institute director Francois Heisbourg told a news conferencethat 1988 was ``the year in which the Cold War ended.''   ``We move from a highly polarized and very threatening world ...(into one) which will be much less stable, much more messy, albeitwith a much more relaxed East-West relationship,'' Heisbourg said.   On the proliferation of missiles, including those capable ofcarrying nuclear warheads, the survey said that within the last twoyears, new ballistic missile programs have been revealed throughoutthe Third World posing ``global risks.''   ``In all, more than 20 developing countries have ballisticmissiles programs,'' said the survey.   Argentina, Brazil, India, Iran, Iraq and Israel have severalmissile development programs, while North Korea, South Korea, Libyaand Taiwan each have highly secret missile programs, the surveysaid.   It also listed Afghanistan, Algeria, Cuba, Egypt, Indonesia,Kuwait, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Syria, North Yemen and South Yemenamong 21 developing countries known to have acquired ballisticmissiles.   ``While no developing country except China appears capable ofproducing an intercontinental weapon before the end of the century,space-launch vehicles under development in Brazil, India, Israeland Argentina could form the basis for long-range missiles in thefuture,'' the survey said.   Arsenals of other developing countries varied from theSoviet-made, 44-mile range Frog-7 held by Algeria and Kuwait, tosophisticated weapons with ranges of more than 1,242 miles acquiredby Saudi Arabia from China last year and being developeddomestically by India, the survey said.   India's Agni missile will reportedly be capable of having arange of 1,550 miles, the survey said. ``Missiles of such range aredifficult to justify unless they carry nuclear weapons,'' it added.   The most common ballistic missile in the Third World was theSoviet Scud-B, with a 175-mile range, it said. These missiles wereused in Afghanistan and during the Iran-Iraq war.   The survey said the U.S.-led Missile Technology Control Regime,signed by seven Western nations in 1987, appeared merely to haveslowed some missile programs, but not halted the proliferation.   ``Countries like Brazil and India have had to postpone launchschedules and redouble their domestic research effort,'' said thesurvey.   ``Other countries, such as Argentina and Egypt, have moved totake advantage of unlicensed, black-market technology. Israel'sdomestic research and development is so far advanced that it is, ineffect, immune.''</TEXT></DOC>
