Assessment of explosion intensity requires an understandingof the influence of flow on flame propagation, i.e. turbulent flow velocityas a function of local flow conditions. The authors developed a correspondingmathematical field model featuring cylindrical symmetry; the model representsthe flow field at any point of time of the explosion process. Flame propagationwas found to have a considerable influence on turbulence production retroactively.The pressure increase velocity required for the dimensioning of the reliefcross-sections of a tank, is dependent on initial turbulence and tankgeometry.</TEXT></DOC>
