Bennett assured senators today hewould defend the civil liberties of Americans as coordinator of thegovernment's anti-drug fight, although ``this war is not fordelicate sensibilities.''   In his second day of confirmation hearings as director ofnational drug control policy, the former education secretarydefended his support of school officials who set up metal detectorsand take other measures to control violence and drug abuse in theschools.   ``This war is not for delicate sensibilities,'' he told theSenate Judiciary Committee. ``This is tough stuff.''   However, during a philosophical discussion with committeeChairman Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., Bennett said, ``I can'timagine circumstances in the near future ... that would require us''to suspend civil liberties in the cause of fighting drugs.   ``They are the base. They are the cement. They are the anchor.They sometimes cause us difficulties in this war ... but these arethe ends ... You can't destroy the fabric of the country in order todefend the country,'' Bennett said.   He said he opposed ``some who were arguing for universal (drug)testing of students.''   When Biden asked his reason for that resistance, Bennett replied,``Because I'm sensitive to the Constitution, the Fourth Amendment,''which prohibits unreasonable search and seizure.   The hearing concluded today after representatives of the Leagueof United Latin American Citizens and the Association forSupervision and Curriculum Development offered testimony critical ofBennett's nomination.   Biden, who said Wednesday that, ``My intent ... is to move thisnomination as quickly as possible,'' scheduled a committee vote fornext Thursday.   Among the committee members, only Sens. Howard Metzenbaum,D-Ohio, and Paul Simon, D-Ill. indicated they might vote againstBennett.   The senators praised Bennett's assertions that he would handlethe job aggressively, tackling all the nitty-gritty details ofcoordinating the anti-drug efforts, ending turf battles betweenagencies and focusing on treatment and prevention as well as lawenforcement.   But Sen. Edward M. Kennedy drew Bennett out on whether he wouldsupport a ban on semiautomatic combat-style weapons used by drugtraffickers.   A host of drug-related shootings and the killing of fiveCalifornia schoolchildren have prompted calls for a ban onmilitary-style semiautomatic weapons with high-capacity ammunitionclips. President Bush has said he opposed such regulation, whileMrs. Bush supports a ban.   At Wednesday's hearing, Kennedy pulled out a memo Bennett hadwritten March 14, 1988, to then Attorney General Edwin Meese III inwhich he asked Meese to considering support of legislation ``tobetter manage the production, importation and sale of automaticweapons and other firearms.''   When Kennedy asked him whether he now would support legislationlimiting access to such weapons as AK-47s and Uzis, Bennett said,``It depends on what it is,'' and added that it would be part of thenational drug control strategy that he will be called upon to puttogether within 180 days of taking office.   The weapons in question are semiautomatic adaptations of AK-47sand Uzis. The tightly regulated military versions can switch backand forth from semiautomatic to automatic.   ``I will admit a personal reservation about private ownership ofAK-47s,'' Bennett said. ``I'm not a gun owner. ... The presidentknows I have my concerns.''   Metzenbaum questioned Bennett about how many minority groupmembers he had hired to the new office and how many he planned tohire, and Simon criticized Bennett's failure to file a minorityhiring plan with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission when heheaded the education department.   Bennett said he would stand on his record on employment ofminorities when he headed the education department and the NationalEndowment for the Humanities, saying, ``I have a record as good asanybody.''   ``We will make every effort to fill the positions with the bestpeople we can find,'' Bennett said. ``Will I hire someone to a jobjust because he's a minority? No. That's an insult to that person.''   Bennett told the committee that he felt he could do the drug czarjob well, although there will be no quick victories in the waragainst drugs.   ``It will take more than 180 days to turn the tide around,'' hesaid.   Bennett said he would use the job both as as bully pulpit and asa way to coordinate and direct the drug-fighting activities ofgovernment agencies, and he said he has been getting cooperationfrom the heads of agencies he'll be dealing with as drug czar.   ``I've been getting my calls returned,'' he said. ``I'm evengetting some calls returned that I didn't make.''</TEXT></DOC>
