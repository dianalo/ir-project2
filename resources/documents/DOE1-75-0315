The patient was a 64-year-old euthyroid man with acromegaly.He also had multiple follicular and papillary thyroid carcinomas witha metastatic lesion in the lumbar vertebrae. After a total thyroidectomy,he became slightly hypothyroid, and the lumbar lesion began to incorporate{sup 131}I by scintigraphy. When an iodine-containing contrast mediumhappened to be injected, a transient increase of serum thyroid hormonelevel was observed. After complete thyroid ablation with 83 mCi of {sup131}I, the oral administration of 100 mg of potassium iodide for 7 daysinduced a prominent increase of serum thyroid hormone level. These findingsindicated that the metastatic thyroid carcinoma could produce excessthyroid hormone insofar as a sufficient amount of iodide was given. Althoughthis is the first report of such a case, iodide-induced thyrotoxicosismay not be rare in patients with thyroid carcinomas because the Wolff-Chaikoffeffect is thought to be lost, and the organic iodinating activity andlysosomal protease activity are well-preserved.</TEXT></DOC>
