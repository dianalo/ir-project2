Col. Oliver North, The Miami Herald reported today.   Quoting unidentified sources close to the Iran-Contra inquiry,the newspaper says the administration feared that any discussion ofthe documents in court might disrupt U.S. intelligence in severalcountries.   One source said some of the withheld documents were declassifiedduring congressional investigations of the Iran-Contra affair, butwere later reclassified in an effort to limit discussion of theincidents they describe, the Herald said.   Special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh asked that the two majorcharges against North be dismissed after the Reagan administrationrefused to allow certain documents to be used in North's trial. U.S.District Judge Gerhard Gesell is expected to act on Walsh's requestthis week.   The newspaper said some of its sources are closely tied toNorth's defense team while others either worked closely with Northin the past or participated in the 1987 congressional investigationinto the Iran-Contra affair.   One of the sources is a senior administration official whoadvises the State Department and the White House on Central Americansecurity policy, the newspaper said.   Countries listed in the documents, the sources said, includeCosta Rica, El Salvador, and Venezuela where _ respectively _North's resupply network aiding the Nicaraguan Contra rebels builtan airstrip, controlled part of an air base and attempted to buymilitary aircraft.   North's activities in these countries were central to Walsh'slegal strategy to show that the former National Security Councilaide conspired to defraud the United States and steal governmentproperty by using the profits from arms sales to Iran to purchasesupplies for the Contras.   Those are the charges Walsh says he must withdraw.   In each case, the sources said, Walsh has documentary evidence,including invoices, receipts and other legal papers, showingtransactions involving Iran arms sales profits and Contra supplies.</TEXT></DOC>
