Meanwhile, such old standbys as Audubon and Sierramagazines are turning more consumer-oriented to attractreaders and boost sales.</LP><TEXT>   The new environmental magazines are few in number: No morethan a half-dozen have solid national distribution, comparedwith more than 40 new sports magazines in the past year,according to Samir Husni, a researcher at the University ofMississippi's Department of Journalism who tracks newmagazine issues. And many environmental start-ups in the pastcouple of years were stillborn or folded quickly for lack ofseed money.   But those that have survived -- such as Garbage, E andBuzzworm -- are selling well at bookstores and newsstands.Between 50% to 60% of environmental magazine copies are sold,compared with 38% for the average magazine, Dr. Husni says.With enough magazines on the market, &quot;they can be presentedon the newsstand in such a way as to gain visibility and,hopefully, more subscribers,&quot; he adds.   Despite the ad-sales slump, these environmental offeringshave been selling more space. Three-year-old Buzzworm, amagazine filled with high-quality photography and in-deptharticles, saw ad pages for the first five issues this yearjump more than 40% to 170, compared with 120 during acomparable period in 1990. The nonprofit E magazine, whichanalyzes current issues such as toxic waste and the greeningof cities, has seen gross ad sales increase 50% in the pastyear to $60,000 an issue and has built its circulation to80,000.   &quot;We've weathered the recession remarkably well consideringwe're a new magazine,&quot; says Patricia Poore, editor andpublisher of Garbage, a two-year-old bimonthly with a focuson consumer-oriented news. Advertising has increased over 60%in a year, from 20 to 33 ad pages an issue.   Publishing veterans say the competition for advertisersand subscribers between the newcomers and old-timerspublished by the Sierra Club and the National Audubon Societyis accelerating. &quot;They're all trying to hit the magic formulaand steal readers,&quot; says Schellie Hagan, a former Audubonstaffer.   Several old liners are exploiting their high namerecognition to battle the upstarts for mainstream newsstanddisplay. Sierra magazine is selling copies of its latestissue in retail outlets for the first time. A bigger, bolderlogo on the cover complements new features on health andhome, says publisher Carole Pisarczyk.   &quot;Sierra is a household name and that's important on thenewsstand,&quot; Ms. Pisarczyk says. &quot;We really need to appeal tothe more broad-based consumer who isn't necessarily amember.&quot; So far, ad pages are up 23.7% over 1990.   Sierra's most direct competitor, the traditionallyindependent and conservative Audubon, is also reshaping itsmarketing and content. In March, National Audubon Societypresident Peter A.A. Berle fired Les Line, Audubon's editorfor 25 years, and in July brought in Michael Robbins, aformer editor of the now-defunct Oceans magazine whodismissed almost the entire editorial staff. Former staffersaccuse Mr. Berle of trying to &quot;trivialize&quot; the magazine'scontent in pursuit of more and younger readers.   Mr. Berle vehemently denies such accusations. &quot;Themagazine is evolving, but there will be no revolutionarychange,&quot; Mr. Robbins says, noting that there will be morearticles about the relationship between &quot;humankind and thenatural world&quot; rather than mere nature-appreciation pieces.Marketing will include more copies on newsstands, he adds,but Audubon &quot;isn't infatuated with numbers like people seemto think. Since we're dealing with important issues, we justwant to reach the widest possible audience.&quot;   Many of the older magazines such as Audubon and Greenpeacedownplay the influence of the newer ones. &quot;In a way,magazines like E and Garbage are fulfilling their internalmandate, but we still have a circulation that is four timestheir entire circulation combined,&quot; says Andre Carothers,editor of Greenpeace. Most of the magazine's readers belongto its parent organization, but it has sold about 8,000copies per issue off the rack since its debut on newsstandsin January.   Such success, however, hasn't stanched the recent declinein donations and membership as the recession has taken itstoll on many of the groups. Greenpeace recently reduced itsbimonthly magazine to a quarterly to save money, and theWilderness Society's Wilderness magazine dropped alladvertising last winter, shrinking in size from 56 to 40pages.   The depressed market, some say, has helped extantpublications by keeping out even more newcomers. &quot;There werea lot of environmental magazines on the drawing board thatcouldn't find seed money,&quot; says Mr. Kelly, the trade magazineeditor.   Among the competing environmental publications is MotherEarth News, which folded last year and was then revived underthe new management of Sussex Publishers Inc. New York-basedSussex pared Mother Earth News's circulation base from550,000 to 350,000.   Then there is Countryside, a Hearst Corp. quarterlypublication aimed at the affluent market. Addressingpreservation and country life-style issues with ado-it-yourself approach, the magazine is successfully drawinghigh-end advertisers like Tiffany and Ralph Lauren and plansto go bimonthly next year with a projected subscriber base of400,000, says Jack Heistand, vice president of magazinedevelopment for Hearst.   Another offering -- two-year-old Trilogy -- is trying todifferentiate itself from the pack by touting its willingnessto air both sides of the environmental debate, whether it'sthe National Rifle Association or radical Earth First] Withsections on recreation, industry and environment, Trilogy hasemerged from the recession almost unscathed, going fromquarterly to bimonthly in May and increasing its paidcirculation to 77,000 for its latest issue from 5,000 fiveissues earlier. Though Trilogy is not yet profitable, KevanKhanamirian, its founder and publisher, says he isaggressively promoting it, distributing free copies atairports and attracting advertising from companies likeChevron Corp. and Ashland Petroleum Co.   While increasing acceptance by mainstream advertisers anda widening subscriber base bode well for many of thesepublications, an economic recovery will mean more magazinesand the inevitable shakeout, industry experts warn.   &quot;I think the environmental/conservation market is alreadysaturated,&quot; says Marlene Scott, general manager of IngramPeriodicals, a magazine distributor in Nashville, Tenn.&quot;Everyone's heard about the rain forest and ozone. Thesurvivors will need to go beyond that and show specificallyhow we can get involved to make substantial changes. . . .Becoming too generalized will be their demise.&quot;   ---   JWT Pares Los Angeles                                                                                                          J. Walter Thompson, after losing many of the accountshandled by its Los Angeles office, plans to cut operationsthere drastically and move a chunk of its Southern Californiaclient business to San Francisco.   Under a new operating plan, the creative,strategic-planning and media responsibilities for Los Angelesclients will now be directed out of Thompson's much-healthierBay Area office. However, the WPP Group unit will keepspot-TV buying and some account-management duties for thoseclients in the Los Angeles office. A portion of the creativework for the shop's newly won Northwest Airlines account willalso be serviced out of the smaller Los Angeles operation.   Steve Darland, executive vice president and generalmanager of Thompson's San Francisco office, will takemanagement responsibility for both offices. Bill Lane, theexecutive vice president who had headed up the Los Angelesoffice, will remain in Los Angeles to head up the Northwestcreative effort.   Mr. Darland said the agency hopes to transfer &quot;a majority&quot;of Thompson's 46 Los Angeles employees to San Francisco.Other positions will likely be eliminated, but Mr. Darlandwouldn't speculate how many. Thompson's Los Angeles office,which now bills about $25 million, has been reeling fromclient defections including Bally Manufacturing Corp., 20thCentury Fox Film and, most recently, Vons Cos. Its remainingclients include Paramount Home Video and Mexicana Airlines.   &quot;JWT remains committed to the L.A. market,&quot; said RonBurns, chief executive officer of Thompson's North Americanoperations. &quot;We'll now be operating under a new servicingconcept that I think makes a huge amount of sense for todayand the future.&quot;   ---   Ad Notes. . . .
