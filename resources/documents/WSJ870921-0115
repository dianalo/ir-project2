But Wynn's management is putting together a buy-out proposal of its own, said John Lillicrop, president and chief executive officer of the maker of automotive products. The management group is still looking for financing, he said.    Wynn's is studying the Security Pacific proposal, he added.    The market appears to be anticipating a higher bid than the $27.25-a-share proposed by Security Pacific Venture Capital Advisory Corp., a unit of Security Pacific Bank's holding company. Wynn's shares closed Friday at $28.875, up $9.50, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.    Carl Wynn, the company's 91-year-old founder, holds 18.4% of Wynn's 3.8 million shares outstanding. Mr. Wynn couldn't be reached for comment.    Wynn's, which specializes in automotive air conditioners, has had sluggish sales and low profitability. For the six months ended June 30, Wynn's net income fell 52% to $1.5 million, or 40 cents a share, from a year earlier. Sales increased 1% to $147.8 million.    William Tichy, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said Los Angeles-based Security Pacific's bid was &quot;fair&quot; based on Wynn's recent performance. But, he added, it represents only 1.3 times the company's book value.    Mr. Lillicrop said Wynn's appointed a committee of four outside directors to study the Security Pacific bid and was looking for an investment banking firm. He said the Security Pacific group included &quot;other participants,&quot; but declined to identify them.    A spokeswoman for Security Pacific said, &quot;We're acting as an adviser to an investment syndicate of which we are one of the principals.&quot;    In a leveraged buy-out, a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing. Ultimately, the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or sale of its assets. </TEXT></DOC>
