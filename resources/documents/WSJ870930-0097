The measure, which repairs the Gramm-Rudman law's automatic deficit-reduction mechanism, was attached to a bill raising the federal debt ceiling. In an unusual Rose Garden signing ceremony, Mr. Reagan complained that he was forced to sign the measure to keep the federal government from default. He acknowledged that &quot;there are some in Congress who think they have me trapped&quot; into accepting either defense cuts or new taxes to meet the bill's deficit-cutting targets.    But Mr. Reagan pledged that he would fight both of those methods for closing the deficit and insisted that he would push instead for deep cuts in domestic spending. &quot;To those who say we must weaken America's defenses, they're nuts,&quot; Mr. Reagan said. &quot;To those who say we must raise the tax burden on the American people, they too are nuts.&quot; Mr. Reagan offered no specific suggestions about how to make the cuts, which would be politically difficult.    Under the measure, there would be $23 billion in automatic across-the-board cuts split between defense and non-defense spending unless Congress and the administration can agree by Nov. 20 on a plan for reducing the deficit by that amount another way.    The $23 billion deficit-reduction target, which applies to the fiscal year that starts Thursday, was even bigger under the original Gramm-Rudman law. But that law's deficit-reduction mechanism was voided by the Supreme Court.    Some domestic programs would be exempt from the automatic cuts, a fact Mr. Reagan criticized.    Mr. Reagan signed the bill while seated in front of leading Republican lawmakers who had helped work out the measure. Such ceremonies usually are staged so the president can lavish praise on the bill he is signing and to thank lawmakers who worked for its passage.    But in this case, White House aides scheduled the ceremony so that Mr. Reagan could unleash a strong verbal attack on the legislation he was signing. The lawmakers looked on awkwardly as the president voiced his strong criticism.    &quot;America can avoid a fiscal disaster, but Congress will not do it by putting their hand in your pocket or with a get-soft defense program,&quot; he asserted. Later, he added: &quot;From this moment on, the big spenders in Congress will have a fight on their hands.&quot;    Despite the tough rhetoric, White House aides have said they hope to continue quiet discussions with congressional leaders in search of a mutually acceptable package of revenue-raising measures and spending cuts to reach the $23 billion target. And many Democrats on Capitol Hill, while disappointed with Mr. Reagan's tough comments, also continued to hold out hope that he would be willing to negotiate a deficit-reduction package.    Administration officials acknowledge that the complex new budget law is likely to force the president to choose between tax increases and defense spending.    If the president refuses to sign a tax bill and instead allows the automatic spending cuts to take effect, administration officials estimate that spending authority for defense could be cut as low as $276 billion, down from this year's level of $289 billion and far below the president's February budget request of $312 billion.    On the other hand, if the president can agree with Congress on a package of $10 billion to $12 billion in tax increases, he may be able to avoid automatic spending cuts and hold defense spending authority to $289 billion, the same as last year, with no allowance for inflation. The chance of getting higher defense spending authority from Congress is now slim, unless the White House agrees to even larger tax increases.    Administration and congressional budget experts believe it will be practically impossible for the president to persuade Congress to make the necessary cuts in domestic spending needed under the new law both to avoid tax increases and to keep defense spending from falling below $289 billion.    The president's advisers are searching for revenue increases that won't be easily labeled as &quot;taxes,&quot; and that the president can therefore agree to. But the revised Gramm-Rudman law makes that task difficult.    It rules out accounting gimmicks such as asset sales or refinancing of government loans, both of which have been adopted by Congress and the administration in the past as a way of boosting government revenues without increasing taxes.    Rep. William Gray (D., Pa.), chairman of the House Budget Committee, said Mr. Reagan's comments suggest &quot;he doesn't want to start that process&quot; of compromise. But Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.), the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said the national interest will be best served in coming weeks &quot;by exchanging ideas, not excuses.&quot;    In the House and the Senate, leaders are moving to assemble a $23 billion deficit-reduction package. Its basic components would include about $12 billion in tax increases, $2 billion of savings from increased tax compliance, $4 billion in reductions in entitlement programs, $1 billion in savings on interest costs and about $5 billion in reductions in projected military spending. </TEXT></DOC>
