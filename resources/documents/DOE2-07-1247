The diagnosis was confirmed in 15 patientsby angiography (n = 2); biopsy (n = 1); and based on absence of symptomsfor 6-18 months, normal liver function tests, and at least one US (n= 5) or CT (n = 7) study suggestive of cavernous hemangioma. The remainingpatients had metastases (n = 3), abscess (n = 1), cysts (n = 1), or anormal liver (n = 1). Dynamic planar and SPECT images were acquired aftermodified in vivo labeling of RBCs with 20 mCi of Tc-99m. Both modalitiesdetected cavernous hemangioma in seen patients; SPECT detected and additionaleight cases that were missed on planar imaging. The authors concludedthat SPECT with Tc-99m-labeled RBCs is accurate in the detection of cavernoushemangioma and more sensitive for small lesions than is planar imaging.</TEXT></DOC>
