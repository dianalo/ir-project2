Ingres/Starcan also be used in a distributed environment with the gateway, and willallow Rdb data to be accessed and used alongside Ingres data residing onalien machines, or other databases supported by Ingres gateways; DEC isplanning to use Ingres technology as the basis for its planned databasemanagement system for its Ultrix Unix operating system after buying rights touse it from Relational Technology (CI No 1,193).andM;- o -andM;Locus Computing Corp has signed its first UK distribution agreement with theOpen Software Products division of the Kernel Group Ltd in Leeds: the companywill distribute the Locus range of MS-DOS and Unix interworking softwarethrough resellers and dealers in the UK.andM;- o -andM;Data General Corp has signed a $5m agreement with Systech Corp for Systech'sVMEbus-based unplug terminals and data communications boards, which enableMultibus and VMEbus systems to communicate with IBM mainframe systems: thesubsystems support up to 256 users and will be integrated into Data General's88000 RISC-based AViiON products; 90% of Input-Output-related CPUhousekeeping tasks are offloaded via the host adaptor with a single-cablebackbone bus and intelligent cluster controllers.andM;- o -andM;Northern Telecom Ltd frowns if anyone tells an Andorran joke these days: theServel de Telecommunications D'Andorra has ordered a public packet switchingnetwork from the Canadian in a pact worth $830,000.andM;- o -andM;Data Switch UK, based in Maidenhead, Berkshire has added a new model to itshost networking systems: the 9088-III supports up to 32 channel-speedcommunications between multiple IBM mainframe communications; it is designedfor mainframe computers that can be divided into a maximum of six logicalprocessing environments, using either IBM's PR/SM or Amdahl MDF, and itsupports 4.5Mbyte-per-second channel speeds; the system is modular and hasdistributed control-processing, so that a system failure is limited to onechannel.andM;- o -andM;ATandamp;T Microelectronics in Berkeley Heights, New Jersey has added a set of linedriver-line receiver data transmission circuits to its commercial productline, claiming that the parts offer the fastest data transmission rates inthe industry for their class: the bipolar devices are designed for use indata buses and backplanes, supercomputers, disk drives, other peripheralssuch as printers and terminals, and digital switching systems; including the41MF, 41MR and 41MT advanced quad differential line receivers, and the 41MGand 41MP advanced quad differential line drivers, the line provides rates upto 400Mbps; they are ATandamp;T's existing L series parts redesigned in ATandamp;T'sscaled fast oxide-isolated logic process.andM;- o -andM;Tulip Computers UK Plc, based in Crawley, West Sussex is to demonstrate an80486-based system at this year's Personal Computer Show.andM;- o -andM;X/Open Group Ltd spokesman Steve Lowen, over in the UK last week, said thatthe organisation had not been able to resolve the user interface issue of acommon Applications Prgramming Interface: Lowen stressed the technicaldifficulties involved, and said he &quot;would not like to put a timeframe on it&quot;when asked to comment on Unix International chief Peter Cunningham'sexpectation of an imminent solution.andM;- o -andM;Motorola Computer Systems Ltd, Maidenhead, Berkshire, opens a new UK officein Slough on September 26.andM;- o -andM;There are so many people in the computer publishing field looking for newniches to occupy that you have to stake your claim way before there is a realmarket for your paper if you want to steal a march: accordingly, the SanFrancisco-based publisher Coastal Associates Publishing Ltd Partnership is tooffer NeXTWeek on the NeXT Inc machine, initially offering it as a quarterlysupplement to MacWeek to make its marker for what could turn into a big newmarket: a price and feature comparison of NeXT, the Macintosh, an IBM PS/2Model 80 and a Sun Microsystems Sparcstation 1 is the biggest come-on for thefirst issue; Coastal is is a limited partnership of Ziff Communications Coand Patch Communications.andM;- o -andM;Ipac Systems Ltd of Swindon, Wiltshire has signed a value added reselleragreement with Telematics International for Telematics Smartnet and Net 25product ranges, and it has sold the SDLC PAD based network to the UK arm ofJohnson Control Systems Inc: the network will link the UK head office's IBMequipment with an X25 based Wide Area Network to the regional divisions;

downside for Tandem is that European sales havebeen weak this year, and is &quot;not coming back as fast as we anticipated&quot;; 20%growth on the $1,300m it did a year ago is still seen for its fiscal toSeptember 30 1989.andM;- o -andM;Compaq Computer Corp is expected to release its multi-processor version ofUnix, developed with Corollary Inc, this autumn for its 80486 EISA box: thecompany says that it will have at least one machine out using the ExtendedIndustry Standard Architecture bus by year-end, and is hoping to have severalof them out.andM;- o -andM;Turns other that former International Signal andamp;

to illustrate the cosmicpotential of the new laptop; whether future generations will agree dependslargely on what present-day users think of the price of the machine, which at#4,500 including hard disk and a battery is not cheap; optional extrasinclude the Data Modem 2400 at #400, and a 1Mb Memory Expansion Kit at #500;Apple justifies the expense in terms of the technology offered - claimingthat here is a portable with the performance of a big Macintosh - and by thefact that two &quot;substantial&quot; orders have been received, with a larger oneexpected to be announced in the next few days.andM;- o -andM;Amidst the glitter surrounding the launch of the Macintosh Portable, the newMacintosh IIci, which was also announced yesterday always ran the risk ofcoming across as the poor relation in the expanding Macintosh personalcomputer family: this would be a somewhat misleading impression, for with its25MHz Motorola 68030 processor, increased memory and built-in video support,the IIci offers the highest performance and functionality in the Mac-intoshrange to date - Apple claims a &quot;45% performance increase&quot; on the old IIcx,which the new machine strongly resembles in looks; the IIci, like theportable, is available from October and will cost #5,450, with an optional4Mb memory upgrade kit at a further #1,235.andM;- o -andM;ATandamp;T Co is set to allow universities and colleges to make binary copies ofits C++ version 2.0 language system for distribution to students for just $25each, with a licence for the C++ source code to be offered at $300 perprocessor.andM;- o -andM;British Telecom has cut prices by an average of 8% on its digital lease linesto the US: there will now be a single set of prices for these lease linesregardless of whether the transmission media is cable or satellite;

and yesterday's issue was wrongly numbered onthe back page.andM;- o -andM;Well it makes a change from the tired old &quot;water goat&quot; for &quot;hydrau-lic ram&quot;,and &quot;invisible, insane&quot; for &quot;out of sight, out of mind&quot;: for those who missedMrs Thatcher's encounter with an EnglishJapaneseEnglish machine translationsystem (the Fujitsu Ltd one? Our version of history doesn't relate), shefirst suggested it try &quot;It is an honour and a pleasure to be visiting thiscompany today&quot;, it came up with &quot;I think in honour visiting this companytoday&quot; not bad; try again; she shortened it to &quot;I think it is an honour tovisit this company today&quot; and things got worse, with the machine responding&quot;I think the visit today in this company in honour&quot;, and the third attemptwas the worst &quot;This company's having visited of me is honourable&quot;...andP;  lookslike we'll have to make do with humans a while yet.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
