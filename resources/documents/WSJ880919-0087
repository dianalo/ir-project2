The Democratic presidential candidate, seeking to project an image of toughness and to exploit George Bush's support for the Reagan administration's witless Iran arms deals, vowed last week to use military force against terrorists instead of making deals with them. The Massachusetts governor's promise is only a faint echo of Ronald Reagan's reckless 1981 pledge of &quot;swift and effective retribution&quot; against terrorists, but he, too, may be promising more than he can deliver.    Mr. Dukakis's advertised readiness to use force suggests the Democratic candidate hasn't learned three lessons from the Reagan administration's often hapless war against terrorism: Don't exaggerate the threat terrorism poses to the U.S., understand that American military power is limited, always be willing to talk.    Mr. Dukakis's national security adviser, Madeleine Albright, last week outlined four instances in which she said a President Dukakis would unleash the military: to defend the U.S., to protect American citizens, to fulfill treaty obligations, and to deter or punish terrorists.    These plans sound reasonable enough, but they could lead the U.S. to undertake unworkable policies.    First, though terrorism is a menace, raising it to the level of, say, the defense of Western Europe grossly exaggerates its importance and plays into the hands of terrorists who seek attention and recognition.    Second, while selling arms to Iran was stupid, some deals with terrorists -- especially the kind everybody can deny -- make sense. The Carter administration negotiated an end to the Iran hostage crisis. And the Reagan administration secretly orchestrated a swap, denied by all hands, of Lebanese prisoners in Israel for the hostages aboard hijacked TWA Flight 847.    Third, military force is neither as easy to use nor as effective as Mr. Dukakis seems to suggest. The Libyan raid knocked Col. Moammar Gadhafi out of the terrorism business, but not for long. The State Department says Libya &quot;resumed terrorist activity&quot; in July 1986 -- three months after the U.S. bombing. And the stunning capture of the Achille Lauro hijackers almost caused a shoot-out with Italian military forces and allowed the terrorists' leader to escape.    Gov. Dukakis's aides say he would strike at terrorist base camps. That sounds good, but the notion that the thugs are gathered in the desert waiting to be bombed is an illusion. Swedish police recently discovered a base and arms cache used by the notorious Abu Nidal organization: It was an apartment in Stockholm.    In 1984, the Joint Chiefs of Staff rejected proposals to bomb the barracks where the bombing of the U.S. Embassy annex in Beirut was rehearsed. And in 1985 the chiefs rejected proposals to launch cruise missiles at a meeting of Lebanese and Iranian terrorist leaders at the same barracks. The risk to U.S. pilots, to civilians, or both, was deemed too high.    Vice President Bush knows all this. His record, though, isn't very impressive. He headed a task force which publicly concluded that making concessions to terrorists only encourages more terrorism. But former National Security Adviser John Poindexter wrote that the vice president was &quot;solid&quot; in supporting the secret attempt to swap arms for hostages.    There isn't any evidence that Mr. Bush ever spoke out against the clandestine policy, even after a series of arms deals and a secret trip to Iran produced nothing and an Israeli official explained to him that the U.S. was dealing with radicals, not moderates, in Tehran.    Nor is there evidence that the vice president had much effect on an anti-terrorism policy that by early 1986 was dangerously out of control. Mr. Bush abandoned his task force staff's sole new recommendation, for a small group in the National Security Council staff to coordinate anti-terrorism policy, in the face of the usual bureaucratic opposition. The energetic Lt. Col. Oliver North promptly created the group himself.    Gov. Dukakis's campaign literature says he considers terrorism &quot;an international crime, pure and simple,&quot; to be fought with police work, intelligence, international cooperation and tough penalties. The Reagan administration's policies after the Iran-Contra affair reflect the same conclusion. It mightn't sound sexy in campaign speeches, but it's better policy than promising to call in air strikes. </TEXT></DOC>
