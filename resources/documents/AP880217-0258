AML Futures is the last of six financial institutions accused byMinpeco of participating in an illegal price manipulation schemethat drove up silver prices that led to substantial losses for thecompany, owned by the government of Peru.   The Hunts claim they did nothing illegal when they began pouringmoney into the silver market. From August 1979 to March 1980, theprice of silver rose from $9 an ounce to $50 an ounce before themarket collapsed to about $10 an ounce.   Jury selection is scheduled to begin Thursday in the trialagainst the Hunts _ Nelson Bunker, William Herbert and Lamar _before U.S. Federal District Judge Morris E. Lasker in New YorkCity. Opening arguments in the case are scheduled for Wednesday,Feb. 24.   The AML Futures settlement and those by the other institutionsadd up to $64.65 million, said Mark A. Cymrot, of Cole andamp; Corrette,the Washington, D.C., firm that represents Minpeco.   Minpeco, Peru's largest precious metals distributor, seeks torecover $150 million in damages.   In addition to AML Futures, E.F. Hutton andamp; Co. (now part ofShearson Lehman Brothers Inc.), Merrill Lynch, Prudential-BacheSecurities Inc., Continental Grain Co.'s ContiCommodity Servicesunit and Banque Populaire Suisse have reached out-of-courtagreements with Minpeco since 1986.   The original damage claim was for $225 million to $252 millionthat Minpeco said it lost in trading losses and potential profitsbecause of silver market manipulations in late 1979 and early 1980by the Hunt brothers.   On Dec. 22, Lasker ruled that Minpeco must subtract from itsdamage claim profits made when silver bullion prices skyrocketed,and could not sue for lost potential profits. These rulings reducedthe amount of the claim to $150 million.   The Hunts also are facing two class action suits by more than17,000 silver futures investors, who claim that illegal marketmanipulation caused them losses.</TEXT></DOC>
