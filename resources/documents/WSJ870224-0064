Many of the more than 400 industry leaders gathered here for the Personal Computer Forum, an annual conclave, are making decidedly upbeat sounds, in contrast to the moaning and groaning that marked the gathering a year ago.    &quot;I am more optimistic about the outlook for the industry than at any time since I have been in it,&quot; said John Sculley, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Apple Computer Inc., Cupertino, Calif. Mr. Sculley came to Apple, and the computer industry, from PepsiCo Inc.'s Pepsi-Cola unit in 1983.    &quot;The slump in the personal computer business is over. We are back to respectable growth rates and a lot of fun,&quot; added John Roach, chairman and chief executive of Tandy Corp., Fort Worth, Texas.    Although sales turned up in the second half of last year, nobody is predicting a return to the nearly triple-digit growth rates of 1982 and 1983 when the industry was in its infancy. Now a variety of questions about new hardware and software may confuse buyers and thus hurt the recovery. And many manufacturers are worried about the effect that expected new products from International Business Machines Corp. will have on the market. The worry is that customers may delay purchases for months, waiting for the moves of the standard-setting computer giant.    Even so, said Mr. Roach, 25% to 30% growth in dollars and units in 1987 &quot;is certainly in the realm of possibility.&quot; Other predictions were less ebullient, but analysts still are expecting improvement over the past two years, when growth was less than 10%.    Seymour Merrin of Gartner Group, a Stamford, Conn., research firm, said he expects 30% growth in units sold this year, but with only a 15% to 18% increase in dollar volume because of continued price declines.    Despite the potential for customer confusion, on the whole the industry is expected to benefit from the numerous products that several companies will introduce this year.    Next week, Mr. Sculley said, Apple will introduce a more-powerful version of its Macintosh computer for the office market. The so-called Open Mac is expected to be easier for other vendors to attach their products to. Mr. Sculley also said Apple plans to have a &quot;major introduction involving Unix,&quot; an operating system designed by American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. that is used by many engineering computers. Operating systems control the internal workings of a computer.    IBM is expected to introduce personal computers across its product line in the next two months, and many other personal computer companies will also. &quot;It's an incredibly rich new product year -- certainly the richest in my memory,&quot; said Benjamin Rosen, chairman of Compaq Computer Corp., Houston.    Compaq already has introduced a computer based on Intel Corp.'s powerful new 80386 microprocessor, and many other companies, including IBM, have made it clear that they will do likewise.    While new products don't guarantee success, they will answer some customer concerns. Combined with the hoopla that traditionally surrounds product introductions, the offerings should help spur demand.    In addition, many corporate customers that held off buying computers during the past two years are resuming purchases because they've had time to digest prior equipment purchases and decide where the market is heading. Although prices of basic computers are expected to continue falling rapidly, companies typically are buying products with more features, such as increased memory and better graphics.    Some worry that IBM may temporarily paralyze the market if the company decides to use an operating system in some of its new products that differs from the current industry standard. Such a move could raise serious questions of compatibility between machines and existing software made by many vendors, possibly forcing customers to choose between Big Blue and the rest of the industry. Some might simply hold off under such circumstances until the situation became clear.    Finally, customers and software companies must guess how popular the current IBM PC AT design will continue to be and how soon 80386-based computers will surpass it.    The conference participants generally are downplaying these concerns, however.    &quot;I think we're now a solid double-digit growth industry,&quot; Mr. Rosen said, &quot;and I don't think it's just '87. I think it's '87 and beyond.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
