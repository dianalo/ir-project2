(B) French Declaration of the Rights of Man.   (C) Russian Constitution.   (D) U.S. Constitution.   The answer, comrades, is that the world has indeedchanged. What does it mean when the new Russian Constitutionpromises more economic rights than Americans now get incourt? That the U.S. Supreme Court needs to enforce theeconomic rights our Founders intended, but that our judgeshave ignored for 50 years. Otherwise, we risk the EconomicRights Gap.   The justices have a chance to revive these rights in acase they will hear next Tuesday, General Motors v. Romein.GM and Ford Motor Co. object to a 1987 Michigan law thatretroactively required them to increase benefits to workers.An earlier law let companies offset workers' compensationwith other benefits, but at the behest of the auto unions,legislators created a $25 million liability for the autocompanies.   When a state retroactively rewrites private agreements, itraises the issue of the constitutional protection that fromthe Founding through the 19th century formed the basis ofmore Supreme Court decisions than any other provision. Callit the Mystery Clause because not one lawyer in 1,000 todaycould identify it. Hint: It didn't deal with religiousfreedom, search-and-seizure law or ACLU-style arguments tostop allmale inner-city schools.   It was the Contracts Clause, which before 1889 accountedfor 40% of the cases challenging the validity of state lawsor regulations. The clause's broad protection for thesanctity of contracts makes it easy to see why. It prohibitsa state from passing any &quot;law impairing the obligation ofcontracts.&quot; As Chief Justice John Marshall wrote in 1819, theFounders &quot;intended to establish a great principle, thatcontracts should be inviolable.&quot;   The Constitution's immediate concern was to ban &quot;staylaws,&quot; where state legislatures rewrote debt agreements togive lenders moratoriums on repayments. James Madison wrotethat when politicians interfere with contracts, they act&quot;contrary to the first principles of the social compact andto every principle of sound legislation.&quot; He called theContracts Clause a &quot;constitutional bulwark in favor ofpersonal security and private rights.&quot;   Until the New Deal, courts often stopped states frominterfering with contracts between private parties or where astate was one of the parties. The justices blocked Georgiafrom revoking a land grant and invalidated a New Yorkbankruptcy law that discharged a debt. The clause was writtento apply only to the states, not to impairment of contractsby the federal government, probably because the Foundersnever thought the national government could grow someddlesome. It's not clear that the Founders intended thiseither, but the courts invalidated only retroactiveinterferences, not laws that affect future obligations undercontracts.   In 1886, British legal scholar Sir Henry Maine said theContracts Clause was key to U.S. economic development. &quot;Inpoint of fact there is no more important provision in thewhole Constitution,&quot; he wrote. &quot;It is this prohibition whichhas in reality secured full play to the economical forces bywhich the achievement of cultivating the soil of the NorthAmerican Continent has been performed; it is the bulwark ofAmerican individualism against democratic impatience andsocialistic fantasy.&quot;   Maine added, with some prescience, &quot;We may usefully bearin mind that, until this prohibition, as interpreted by thefederal courts, is got rid of, certain communistic schemes .. . have about as much prospect of obtaining practicalrealization in the U.S. as the vision of aCloud-Cuckooborough to be built by the birds between earthand sky.&quot;   The justices started to build Cuckooland in 1934 when theyupheld Minnesota's New Deal-era stay law to stop foreclosureson mortgages. Whatever &quot;was said 100 years ago,&quot; the courtruled, &quot;the reservation of the reasonable exercise of theprotective power of the state is read into all contracts.&quot;Even after the Depression, the Supreme Court ruled againstevery Contracts Clause claim between 1941 and 1977.   Instead of the absolute protection for contracts that theConstitution promised, the Supreme Court began applying avague balancing test that upholds an impairment of a contractif it's &quot;reasonable and necessary to serve an importantpublic purpose&quot; -- whatever this means. (Imagine the outragefrom First Amendment backers if the justices upheld censoringor established a national church because they decided it was&quot;reasonable.&quot;) In a 1965 case letting Texas renege on areal-estate deal, Justice Hugo Black dissented &quot;from thiscourt's balancing away the plain guarantee&quot; of enforcedcontracts.   The Supreme Court can invalidate the Michigan statute inGM v. Romein without completely resurrecting the ContractsClause, but some justices could be ready to restore thisclause to the Constitution. Clarence Thomas embraced broadeconomic rights in his confirmation hearings. Justice AntoninScalia offered a broad defense of the clause in a 1988 speechat the University of Cincinnati.   &quot;I think it highly probable that over the past 200 yearsthe Supreme Court . . . has in fact narrowed the ContractsClause of the Constitution well short of its originalmeaning,&quot; Justice Scalia said. &quot;Our modern society isundoubtedly not as enthusiastic about economic liberties aswere the men and women of 1789, but we should not foolourselves into believing that because we like the result theresult does not represent a contraction of liberty.&quot;   It's clear from the Constitution that enforcing lawfulcontracts was supposed to be a main purpose of government.This year, Ronald Coase won the Nobel Prize in economics fornoting how barriers to enforceable agreements createinefficient transaction costs; the Founders deserve to sharein Mr. Coase's prize. An enforced Contracts Clause would makefor an economic-growth program -- especially if the justicesalso strictly enforce the Takings Clause ban on expropriationwithout full compensation, the subject of last week's column.   If the Supreme Court again embraces constitutionaleconomic rights, legislators will no longer dictate laboragreements, rent control or obligations under financialinstruments. A half-century of unconstitutional precedentswould need review.   This is a tall order, but even former communists havebecome revolutionaries for constitutionally protectedeconomic rights. It's time for the Supreme Court to join thetrend by recognizing once again the genius of our ownConstitution.</TEXT></DOC>
