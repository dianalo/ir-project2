It conceivably could also exposeGeneral Electric to further litigation involving some of thedozen plants in the U.S. where similar boiling-water reactordesigns are used.</LP><TEXT>   Judge Alan A. McDonald had sealed his ruling last June toavoid causing bias in the jury that was due to consider a$1.2 billion WPPSS suit accusing General Electric of fraudand breach of contract.   When the 10-member jury split in July and a mistrial wasdeclared in the case, tried in Phoenix, Ariz., the judge'sruling remained sealed on the issue of whether GeneralElectric's liability under the contract terms should remaincapped.   The ruling was unsealed yesterday by Judge McDonald inSpokane, Wash., however, at the request of The Wall StreetJournal and of Clearing Up, a Seattle-based energy industrynewsletter.   WPPSS has requested a new trial before Judge McDonald,without a jury, on the broader issues of General Electric'sliability in the case. A spokesman for the utility called thejudge's wording &quot;quite damning,&quot; and said the ruling &quot;showsthat we were correct and prudent in investing five years ofeffort in the case.&quot; He particularly noted that the judgedescribed some testimony by GE personnel as &quot;forced,sometimes forlorn and sometimes incredible.&quot;   The judge said that &quot;key personnel within {GE} were awareof the existence of a number of serious, unresolvedquestions&quot; about the nuclear-containment system, but addedthat &quot;testing sufficient to resolve those questions wasn'tconducted&quot; before the contract was signed.   The judge, at General Electric's request, also released a&quot;special verdict form&quot; showing eight jurors had voted thatthe company hadn't &quot;committed either fraudulentmisrepresentation or fraudulent omission&quot; in dealing withWPPSS. That vote, however, wouldn't be part of any new trial,while Judge McDonald's removal of the cap on GE's liabilitywould be expected to remain in force.   The judge used harsh language in critizing GeneralElectric for withholding from WPPSS &quot;any doubts or questionsabout the adequacy of its pressure-suppression system&quot; innegotiating the contract. The system, within the thickconcrete containment-vessel enclosure, is designed to preventthe escape of radiation following a nuclear accident.   Responding to Judge McDonald's ruling, a spokesman for GE,based in Fairfield, Conn., said: &quot;GE disagrees with thecourt's ruling, believing it was an issue for the jury andnot the judge. We would have challenged it if there was aneed to do so. We believe it has no binding effect.&quot;   &quot;The outcome of the exhaustive five-month trialconvincingly shows that {the} WPPSS charges are withoutmerit,&quot; the spokesman added.   Several other utilities with nuclear reactors andcontainment vessels designed by General Electric have closelywatched the WPPSS case. Pennsylvania Power andamp; Light Co. andCleveland Electric Illuminating Co. sent attorneys to observeparts of the Arizona trial. General Electric has said thatthe only similar lawsuit against it has been a $600 millionaction filed by Long Island Lighting Co., owner of theShoreham nuclear plant in Brookhaven, N.Y. Jury selection forthe trial is scheduled to begin Nov. 5.   The judge characterized as &quot;a fairly sophisticated form ofRussian roulette&quot; the comments of one witness who &quot;pointedwith pride to the several start-ups as constituting afull-scale test.&quot;   Listing several internal company documents showingproblems that could crop up with the containment design,Judge McDonald said: &quot;General Electric knew these problemsshould be examined but decided to adopt only an analyticalapproach, because the full-scale tests required to prove thatthe phenomena would not occur in its then present containmentdesign would be, I am quoting from the documents, `veryexpensive.'&quot;   A &quot;most telling piece of evidence,&quot; the judge said, wasone August 1968 company memorandum mentioning the need for &quot;afull-scale test&quot; to answer one design question. There wasn'tany evidence presented to show the test was conducted, JudgeMcDonald said, adding: &quot;General Electric's witnesses toexplain this document were not believable.&quot;   Other GE documents he cited, dating back to 1958, showedthat the company &quot;was aware of certain phenomena that couldoccur as a result of the normal or accidental operation&quot; ofthe system. A May 1958 preliminary test result that was citedconsidered a containment-vessel phenomenon called &quot;waterhammer,&quot; resulting from the collapse of steam bubbles. Waterhammer wasn't a problem in low-steam rates used in the test,the document said. But it added that &quot;it cannot be safelyconcluded&quot; that a full-scale steam discharge wouldn't &quot;createshock waves or forces which could be damaging,&quot; yet wouldn'tshow up in the small-scale tests.   WPPSS's claims against General Electric in the suit itfiled in 1985 aren't related to the 1983 default by theutility on $2.25 billion of bonds issued for construction ofits nuclear units Nos. 4 and 5. Those units were abandonedafter being partially built.</TEXT></DOC>
