(Northridge), a Canadian supplier,for a ten-year period, all as more fully set forth in the application,which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. Great Lakes states that Northridge has requested that Great Lakes transportup to 15,000 Mcf per day (Mcfd) effective the first day of the month followingthe later of October 31, 1989, and the date Great Lakes advises Northridgethat all satisfactory authorizations deemed necessary or required by GreatLakes to provide the service have been obtained. The transportation willbe from a point where the facilities of Great Lakes interconnect with thoseof TransCanada Pipelines Limited (TransCanada) on the International Boundaryat Emerson, Manitoba (Emerson Receipt Point), to an existing point of interconnectionbetween the facilities of Great Lakes and Michigan Consolidated Gas Company(MichCon), located at Belle River Mills, Michigan (Belle River Mills DeliveryPoint). It is stated that MichCon will transport the Northridge volumesfor redelivery to St. Clair Pipeline,\1\<NOTE/> which will transport the volumes to Union Gas Limited (Union),a Canadian gas distribution company, the primary purchaser of the gas.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Great Lakes states that in the event the constructionof the St. Clair pipeline is not complete when the subject service commences,either (i) MichCon will deliver the volumes to Panhandle Eastern PipelineCompany (Panhandle), or (ii) Great Lakes will deliver the volumes to ANRPipeline Company (ANR) at the Fortune Lake or Farwell Delivery Points forredelivery to Panhandle; Panhandle will redeliver the volumes to Unionat a point where the facilities of each interconnect near Detroit, Michigan.According to Great Lakes, Union is purchasing the volumes on a firm basisfrom Northridge, and Northridge has advised Great Lakes that Union willtake title to the subject volumes upon delivery of the gas into its pipelinesystem. It is further stated that volumes not purchased by Union may bepurchased by LOUTEX Energy, Inc. (LOUTEX), a U.S. natural gas marketer,from Northridge. For such volumes, title will transfer at the Emerson Interconnection.To implement the arrangements, Great Lakes entered into a TransportationService Agreement (Agreement) dated March 3, 1989, which provides, <T3>inter alia,</T3> for a term of ten years. In addition, to the BelleRiver Mills Delivery Point, the contractual arrangements provide that Northridgemay have the volumes delivered at (1) an existing point of interconnectionbetween the facilities of Great Lakes and Northern Natural Gas Company,a Division of Enron Corp. (Northern), located at Carlton, Minnesota (CarltonDelivery Point); (2) existing points of interconnection between the facilitiesof Great Lakes and ANR located at (i) Fortune Lake, Michigan and (ii) atFarwell, Michigan; and (3) an existing point of delivery between the facilitiesof Great Lakes and TransCanada located on the International Boundary atSt. Clair, Michigan. Great Lakes further states that upon written requestof Northridge to Great Lakes, the date for commencement of service maybe delayed to not later than January 1, 1990. The Agreement also providesthat, by mutual agreement of the parties, overrun volumes may be transportedfrom time to time. It is stated that no new facilities are required toprovide the proposed service for Northridge.The agreement provides for a monthly Demand-1 charge of $2.04 per Mcf ofcontract quantity and a Demand-2 charge of $.06705 multiplied by one-twelfthof the annual contract quantity. Great Lakes states that these demand chargesrepresent the demand components of the Base Tariff Rates of Rate ScheduleT-15 of Great Lakes' FERC Tariff, under which volumes are also transportedfrom the Emerson Receipt Point to Great Lakes' Eastern Zone. It is furtherstated that the Agreement also provides for a commodity charge of (1) $.23921per Mcf for volumes received for redelivery at the Farwell, Belle RiverMills and St. Clair Delivery Points; and (2) $.15195 per Mcf for volumesreceived for redelivery at the Fortune Lake Delivery Point; and (3) $.07551per Mcf for volumes received for redelivery at the Carlton Delivery Point.These commodity charges, according to Great Lakes, represent the commoditycomponents, respectively, of (1) Rate Schedule T-15, (2) the transportationcomponent of Rate Schedule CQ-2, and (3) Rate Schedule T-5, of Great Lakes'FERC Gas Tariff; under which volumes of gas are received by Great Lakesat the Emerson Receipt Point, transported, and redelivered, respectively,in Great Lakes' Eastern, Central and Western Zones.Great Lakes states that it is possible that, although not very likely,on a few days during the period April 1st through October 31st of a contractyear, Great Lakes might be unable to transport the entire contract quantity,due to capacity limitation on its system. In this event, Great Lakes statesthat Northridge is entitled to a credit against the monthly demand charges.It is stated that the volumes to be transported hereunder are expectedto be imported (and exported, if sold to Union) by Northridge, pursuantto a long-term authorization that will be sought by Northridge from theDepartment of Energy (DOE). Further, other valid authorizations may beutilized, such as the authorizations granted in DOE/ERA Docket Nos. 87-44-NGand 87-57-NG, to Northridge Petroleum Marketing U.S., Inc., a wholly-ownedU.S. subsidiary of Northridge. Transportation of the subject volumes byANR or Northern is expected to be performed under the authorization ofPart 284 of the Commission's Regulations.

Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">[Docket No. CP89-1264-000]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="44">May 4, 1989.</ITAG>Take notice that on April 24, 1989, Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation(TETCO), P.O. Box 2521, Houston, Texas 77252, filed in Docket No. CP89-1264-000an application pursuant to section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act for a certificateof public convenience and necessity authorizing the construction and operationof 1.0 mile of 30-inch pipeline on its mainline crossing of the MississippiRiver and appurtenant facilities in Point Coupee and West Feliciana Parishes,Louisiana, all as more fully set forth in the application which is on filewith the Commission and open to public inspection.TETCO states that its present mainline crossings of the Mississippi Riverconsist of two 30-inch pipelines, Lines 14 and 18, both of which are situatedin trenches in the river's bed. It is stated that monitoring of the riverbottom in the vicinity of the two lines over the past two years has indicatedextensive scouring immediately downstream of the two lines. It is furtherstated that sever scouring during the period from May 1987 to February1989 has washed out large quantities of dirt downstream of Lines 14 and18 resulting in a scour area approaching 500 feet in width and rangingfrom 10 feet to 40 feet in depth. In addition, it is stated that on theupstream side of Line 14, a hole of the same width but of depth rangingfrom 8 to 18 feet has also been washed away. The effect has been to leavean underwater hill with Line 14 in the middle. TETCO asserts that whenthe river returns to normal flow stages this Spring and additional scouringoccurs, the hill could be washed away exposing the line to the forces ofthe river. Due to the potential vulnerability of Line 14 and to a lesserextent Line 18, TETCO proposes to construct an additional river crossing.TETCO states that the existing crossing would remain in service until deteriorationof the river bed necessitated taking the crossing out of service. In addition,it is stated that the proposed crossing would be installed using the directionalboring method which would allow the crossing to be located well below theriverbed and unaffected by scouring. TETCO states that Lines 14 and 18are located on its principal main transmission lines from the supply areato its market areas. The additional crossing will help ensure the continuedsafe and reliable operation of its main pipeline system.<T3>Comment date:</T3> May 25, 1989 in accordance with Standard ParagraphF at the end of this notice.<ITAG tagnum="84">7.
