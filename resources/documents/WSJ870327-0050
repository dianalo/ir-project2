Hours after BP's bid was announced, Mr. Lowey's law firm filed suit in Cleveland on behalf of Standard's minority shareholders. The class-action suit argued that BP was offering &quot;a fraudulently low and unfair price&quot; for the 45% of Standard it didn't already own. BP's bid should be blocked unless it is increased, the lawyers contended. A Standard spokesman said the company hadn't seen the lawsuit and therefore couldn't comment.    Mr. Lowey and other class-action lawyers scored a spectacular victory with Shell -- a seemingly similar case. There, Royal Dutch/Shell Group originally bid $55 a share, or $5.2 billion, for the 30.5% of Shell that it didn't already own. But Royal Dutch was forced to raise its bid twice, as minority shareholders and outside directors of Shell protested the offering price.    Ultimately, Royal Dutch increased its offer to $60 a share, or $5.67 billion. Said a Delaware judge who approved the final terms: &quot;The results achieved in this case for the class (of shareholders) are outstanding.&quot;    But this time, Wall Street professionals are divided on whether Mr. Lowey and other class-action lawyers can win again. &quot;BP may want to avoid the type of dickering that Royal Dutch faced,&quot; said Philip Poplin, an analyst at the College Retirement Equities Fund. &quot;I think they came in with a large enough price to do so.&quot; Mr. Poplin's institution is among Standard's largest holders, with 2.3 million shares.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Standard closed at $71.375 a share, up $6.50. That was slightly above BP's offering price of $70 a share, but down from a high of $72.25 earlier in the day.    John S. Herold Inc., an oil and gas appraisal concern, added that it doesn't expect BP to encounter the obstacles that Royal Dutch did. The BP bid is &quot;very fair,&quot; said Tom Tracey, a Herold analyst. He said it exceeds his appraisal of $45.30 a share for Standard.    Several Wall Street arbitragers added that they didn't see much room for a higher bid, either.    But Sanford Margoshes, an oil analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., argued that a takeover price in the mid-$70s would be justified. He has been a steady booster of Standard, predicting for example that it will earn $5 a share this year, more than most other analysts expect.    Mr. Margoshes also asserted that Standard's large petroleum reserves in Alaska deserve a premium acquisition price. Those reserves are free of the political risks that many oil companies face on overseas properties, Mr. Margoshes explained. As a result, Mr. Margoshes told clients, he believes a $2-a-share boost in BP's bid is possible.    BP's offer is &quot;reasonable,&quot; said David Dreman, head of Dreman Value Management Inc., which owns 1.3 million Standard shares. But Mr. Dreman said &quot;there's nothing to be lost by waiting to see if they increase it.&quot;    For its part, BP isn't doing anything to encourage speculation about a higher offer. In London yesterday, Sir Peter Walters, BP's chairman, uttered a flat &quot;no&quot; when asked if BP would sweeten its bid. He said unlike Royal Dutch, BP isn't proposing a merger. That means Standard's board doesn't have a legal obligation to place an independent valuation on the company. Such a valuation for Shell, he suggested, figured importantly in those shareholder suits.    In addition, Sir Peter stressed that BP's offer doesn't depend on it receiving a set number of Standard shares, implying that BP would settle for less than the full 45%. Under BP's interpretation of corporate law in Ohio, Standard's home state, the BP chairman believes his company could force minority shareholders to accept the $70 offer if BP's current 55% stake in Standard reached 80%. So the British oil giant only would need acceptance from holders of 25% of the shares to gain the entire stake.    ---   James Tanner in Houston contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
