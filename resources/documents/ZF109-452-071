 Its assignment involves what is reportedly the largestpublisher of Arabic materials in the world.andP;  It uses an Arabic version ofLetraset's ReadySetGo (and, soon, DesignStudio) for page makeup, with all ofthe complications of Arabic composition and of mixing English with Arabic.andO;Production of the newspaper is complicated by changing parts of the editorialand advertising matter to suit local markets.andM;Completed pages of the newspaper are transmitted to nine remote printingsites in the Middle East, Africa, Europe and the United States, using bothCrosfield Pagefax facsimile systems and Macintoshes transmitting PostScriptfiles.andM;With those factors in mind, we recently visited the London-based publisherand the system integrator that has put together the package.andP;  The integratoris a small but well-established desktop software developer, Diwan.andP;  Thepublisher, Saudi Research and Marketing, wanted a Macintosh-based publishingsystem for its newspaper, Asharq Al-Awsat.andP;  Saudi Research claims to be thelargest publisher in the Arab world, with interest in magazine and bookpublishing as well as newspapers.andP;  It prints its editions at 10 printingcenters around the world, and has additional worldwide offices, with plans toopen two more in Europe by next year.andM;Over the last few years, a growing Arabic population and an increasinglysophisticated skill base in London have combined to provide a strongcommunity of knowledgeable publishing professionals for Arabic titles.andP;  Thestrictures of living in Saudi Arabia and the untenable conditions in Beirut,the region's focal point for international communications, have contributedto the emergence of London as a suitable base of operations for variousArabic publishing houses.andP;  Recent events appear to support this rationale.andM;The paperandM;Asharq Al-Awsat, launched in London almost 14 years ago, is positioned as ahigh-quality international daily, a sort of International Herald Tribune forArabs.andP;  Broadsheet in format with an international readership of around250,000 daily, it averages about 26 pages per day with two differentbroadsheet page sizes and local advertising, so the page count and thenumbering vary with the different editions.andP;  It combines Roman and Arabictexts with halftones and display advertising.andM;Asharq Al-Awsat recently added a London tabloid evening edition in responseto the current crisis in the Middle East.andM;Asharq Al-Awsat originally used a production system based on Linotype MVPterminals and VIP typesetters, which later were swapped for Linotype 202sdriven by Linokey input terminals.andP;  Crosfield Pagefax facsimile systemstransmitted fully made-up pages to nine remote sites.andM;The Linokey terminals and the 202s are now retired.andP;  The Pagefax unitsgradually are being replaced by a new system constructed entirely withoff-the-shelf components.andP;  The responsibility for bolting together itsvarious elements is in the hands of Diwan, with assistance from Hyphen.andP;  Thesophisticated Macintosh communications system provides broadcast printing ata much lower cost than previously possible.andM;The greater speed with which the newspaper can produce local editions aroundthe world has contributed significantly to overall improvements in itsproducts.andP;  Among the recent additions are u2-page local evening tabloideditions.andM;The newspaper, which is produced entirely using PostScript, is printed inLondon and in nine remote sites: Abha, Dhahran, Jeddah and Riyadh (all SaudiArabia), and Cairo, Frankfurt, Marseilles, Casablanca and New York.andP;  Itconsists of up to 40 broadsheet pages daily, each containing from two to 30MB of data.andM;Before it began working with Saudi Research in 1988, Diwan developed aMac-based system for a competing title, the high-quality daily Al Hayat.andO;Diwan claims that was the world's first totally PostScript broadsheetnewspaper.andP;  Al Hayat has been outputting PostScript for the last two years.andM;Production processandM;Asharq Al-Awsat is produced at offices in High Holborn in central Londonusing a linear work and management flow.andP;  Five separate zones are set up tohandle text entry, wire service input, page makeup, communications andeditorial functions.andP;  Production is on a page-by-page basis, with allelements in electronic form and each page a self-contained unit.andM;Editors and designers work together on the design of each page becauserepresentation of Arabic must respect the inherent aesthetics of the languageat all levels, from individual words to whole pages.andP;  (See sidebar oncomposition of Arabic.)andP;  Once defined, page layouts are never changed withoutthe approval of the editors.andP;  Completed pages are not sent for transmissionto the remote sites until the editors have given final approval.andM;Text entry.andP;  The majority of reporters working at Asharq Al-Awsat still writetheir stories by hand or type them, after which they are edited carefullybefore being keyboarded on one of the 20 Macintosh SEs in the text-entryzone.andP;  Macintoshes are available for journalists to use if they choose, andgradually the newspaper is moving toward direct entry.andP;  In general, remotecorrespondents call in their stories, although the paper is moving toward theuse of computers (Macintoshes) with modems for its off-site reporters.andM;The Macintoshes run on a thin Ethernet network configured throughout thebuilding.andP;  The network is divided into five zones, as mentioned above, withbridges connecting the zones.andP;  The network supports about one hundredMacintoshes altogether, about half of the total number expected to be runningwhen the system is fully installed.andM;Stories are keyed into the Macs using Diwan's Al Nashir Al Maktabi publishingsoftware (an Arabic version of Letraset's ReadySetGo).andP;  The Diwan version hasbeen adapted somewhat for direct text entry, with added features to providemore finely tuned word processing.andP;  New features include a word count and&quot;ready text blocks&quot; (to save the user from having to specify that a new frameis a text window).andM;This product is also used for page makeup, although it will be replaced by AlNashir Al Sahafi, a special version of DesignStudio.andP;  Al Nashir Al Sahafiwill be sold as a newspaper and magazine page makeup tool.andP;  Existing users ofAl Nashir Al Maktabi will be upgraded to the new product, due for release inSeptember.andM;Stories are keyed, proofed and corrected in the text-entry zone and passed tothe page makeup file servers.andP;  In general, most editors still work with hardcopy, but they are gradually moving toward electronic editing.andP;  Diwan expectsthis transition to be completed in a couple of months.andP;  Automating theeditorial function has been deliberately left to last at the request of thenewspaper.andM;In addition to the Macintosh SEs, the text-entry zone has LaserWriters forproofing and two scanning stations (which use Agfa Focus 2 scanners) forscanning pictures, line art and hand-written headlines.andM;PictureNet for wire photos.andP;  Asharq Al-Awsat uses the Diwan PictureNet andNewsNet products for wire service capture and data management.andP;  Journalists(and editors) on site can work with Macs on the network, looking at wirestories as required.andP;  The can call these stories and graphics into theirindividual work areas, cutting and pasting as needed.andM;Since we last saw PictureNet at Drupa (see Vol.andP;  19, No.andP;  18), Diwan hascompleted support for color images.andP;  Saudi Research is its first installationto handle color images.andM;A device such as the Leafax transmitter sends a color photo separated intored, green and blue components.andP;  The separate picture layers are then locallyaligned by the system operator.andP;  The composite TIFF format of the imageprovides the basis for subsequent CYMK separation using ColorStudio orsimilar software.andP;  A Macintosh IIfx with 16 MB of RAM is generally required,although Asharq Al-Awsat uses an 8-MB machine with a Radius screen forcapturing and aligning the images, with picture editing on another terminalon the network.andM;Apple LaserWriters are used to proof news graphics, which may be cropped orotherwise edited.andM;Within PictureNet, color pictures can be archived, in which case the picturedirectory shows the archive details.andP;  Archived photos can be renamed andgiven annotations, which also can be indexed and stored in the full-textarchive.andP;  This archival feature includes basic data management functions suchas automatically adding a &quot;.1&quot; suffix to files with the same name to preventone from overwriting another.andP;  Asharq Al-Awsat archives data to a dedicatedfile server in the production manager's office.andM;Saudi Research will include the color PictureNet as part of its system forcolor magazine production.andP;  It may also use it for Asharq Al-Awsat itself,although this has yet to be decided.andM;NewsNet for wire stories.andP;  A NetsNet terminal can take up to 16 inputs.andO;(Each Macintosh can accept input from two NewsNet boxes, each of whichhandles eight lines.)andP;  These units, in turn, can be linked serially tosimilar devices.andP;  The system supports a variety of modem lines for a broadrange of inputs, including wire services and remote data sources such asother newspapers or correspondents.andP;  Asharq Al-Awsat has an arrangement withThe Observer for news services and can now accept electronic digital inputfrom correspondents off site.andP;  When rmeote journalists are equipped withMacintoshes and modems, input will be directly into the NewsNet terminal.andM;The paper's &quot;dictionary&quot; (developed by Diwan) automatically checks incomingstories to determine where they should be posted, to a maximum of 99categories, including a spike for stories the system can't categorize.andP;  Thebaskets on the system are set up with criteria lists of either individualwords or complete phrases.andP;  The dictionary automatically checks the incomingstories, identifying words that match the baskets' criteria lists.andP;  Thedictionary can be modified by the user and the criteria lists on individualbaskets can be defined.andP;  Subsequent releases of the product will support manymore of these baskets, although so far 99 have been sufficient.andP;  the definedcategories can also be used for temporary topical news items, so theirconfiguring and reconfiguring is handled as required by the reporter oreditor.andM;Like all of Diwan's products, this system can handle both English and Arabic,although incoming English stories would require subsequent translation intoArabic.andP;  In general, translation is handled by the individual writers andeditors.andP;  Most of the people working at Asharq Al-Awsat are bilingual andoften trilingual.andP;  Translators are available at Saudi Research for otherpublications, so there are never problems with language equivalents.andM;Page production.andP;  Once stories are keyboarded, proofed and corrected, theyare sent via Ethernet to production file servers (currently Macintosh IIcxcomputers, but soon to be upgraded to IIfx models), where they are stored inindividual page folders, ready for page makeup.andP;  There are no jumped storiesin asharq Al-Awsat, so management of copyflow on a page-by-page basis istenable.andM;Page makeup currently takes place on Macintosh IIx machines (also to beupgraded to IIfx class) using Al Nashir Al Maktabi.andP;  Asharq Al-Awsat editorschoose to come to the page makeup zone to check the final pages, althoughthey could view pages on the screen.andP;  Completed pages are always checked withthe editors and designers for aesthetic consistency.andP;  The face-to-facediscussion of the pages is the choice of the editors and not a limitation oftechnology.andP;  Pages will liekly be made up with Al Nashir Al Sahafi when it isavailable.andM;With an average of 26 pages in each edition and four versions appearing intwo sizes, the nine people in the page makeup zone sometimes produce morethan 80 pages per day.andM;Page makeup operators now place high-resolution versions of news graphics,but Diwan hopes to use the Open Prepress Interface (OPI) in its next versionto let them work with low-resolution files.andP;  The high-resolution versionswould then be called on output from a graphics server as a compressed subfilewhen the page is ready for transmission and subsequent output at one of theremote sites.andM;Headlines.andP;  The page makeup people work completely with digital information.andO;Two traditional calligraphers write some of the headlines by hand, afterwhich they are scanned into the system on the Focus 2s in the text-entry zoneand stored as Encapsulated PostScript files.andP;  Although Diwan has developed aheadline font for the paper based on a calligrapher's design, the consensusamong those involved (including Diwan) is that the calligraphers now rendermuch more attractive headlines.andP;  Work is under way to render thecalligrapher's current headline design as a new font.andM;Diwan was able to recreate the paper's logo using Aldus FreeHand, but this istoo cumbersome a process to employ on an ongoing basis.andP;  Thecalligrapher/scanner combination works more efficiently, even though it ismanual.andP;  To automate the headline creation process more completely andeffectively without developing special fonts would require some means ofcalligraphic rendering.andP;  This would probably be a combination of electronicdrawing tools with some user-defined heuristic overlaying features.andM;There are seven major schools of Arabic calligraphic styles, within each ofwhich are many substyles.andP;  Understanding when and how all of these are usedis a tangle of aesthetics and tradition, so comprehensive automation islikely to remain some way off.andP;  Creation of special headline fonts is muchmore reasonable, so Diwan is continuing along this route.andM;Display ads.andP;  All ads that appear in Asharq Al-Awsat are display ads, asclassified ads are not common in Arabic papers.andP;  Asharq Al-Awsat generallycontains 70% editorial matter and 30% display advertising, although theadvertising volume sometimes rises to 40%.andM;Ads are centralized in Jeddah, where the paper's advertising agency islocated, with a proportion of ads (up to 20%) originating in London.andP;  All adsare sent in hard-copy form to London, where they are scanned into the systemand subsequently transmitted with the made-up pages to the appropriate remotesites.andP;  Stripping in ads is rare, even in Jeddah, which is generally theoriginating point.andP;  In Jeddah, there has been some manual stripping when thequality has suffered through transmission on the Pagefaxes, but in general,ads are sent with the page in electronic form.andP;  This is because SaudiResearch ideally wants total control over the paper, with nothing done to thepages locally.andP;  Eventually, ads will be incorporated electronically at theoriginating site, with only ad sizes being transmitted to London, forintegration into the page geometries.andM;The page makeup department localizes pages with the correct ads and localnews (where necessary).andP;  Once complete, pages are passed to a production fileserver, which manages compression and transmission to the appropriate site.andO;The page makeup workstation operator selects PageRouter I or II from theChooser and prints pages to it.andP;  The PageRouters are Macintosh IIci computerswith standard AppleShare Print Server software and a PageRouter DeskAccessory developed by Hyphen.andP;  The Print Server spools jobs to disk, fromwhich they are routed by the PageRouter.andM;Two PageRouters have been installed to cope with a maximal volume of pagesgenerated from the page makeup stations.andP;  A large page (up to 30 MB) cangenerally be copied to all destination folders within six minutes from whenthe file is received by the Print Server.andP;  Times for original pages varydepending on file size and network activity, but copies can be processed assoon as they arrive in a destination folder.andM;Broadcasting printingandM;In the past, and still, to a degree, some compressed page images produced bythe Pagefax systems were transmitted to remote sites.andP;  Using the new Diwancapabilities, made-up pages are sent to the communications zone, where theyare stored in Folders on a dedicated Mac IIfx file server.andP;  The DiwanCommsNet communications software constantly queries this server for completedpages, which it picks up for subsequent processing.andP;  The broadcast printingsoftware automatically puts in the correct page numbers in both Arabic andRoman forms, prior to compressing the entire page--all text and graphics.andO;The use of English and Arabic numerals is to identify individual pages forboth Arabic and non-Arabic readers.andP;  The page numbers also vary depending onthe issue.andM;Pagination requirements differ among the remote locations because localstories and advertising can cause different page breaks in differenteditions.andP;  Ads are retrieved from an ad server--a Mac IIcx.andP;  With the nextversion of the software, this will be the point at which high-resolutiongraphics from a graphics server will be brought to the page.andP;  The system thenqueues the pages for transmission to the rmeote sites.andM;At the various destinations, local file servers run the decompression routineon the pages and queue them for final output on the local imagesetter.andP;  Theseimagesetters are driven by Hyphen software RIPs, which are set up to querythe file servers constantly to find the next page ready for output on 94-picaUltre recorders.andM;Compression and decompression.andP;  Data compression and decompression are pagebased, at a rate as high as 90 to 95% for a complete, fully formattedPostScript page.andP;  Diwan gave us these figures, and we saw a message on thescreen claiming 95% compression, but we had no other way to confirm thisclaim.andP;  It sounds extremely high, so we are somewhat dubious.andP;  Thiscompression routine is not specific to PostScript, Diwan says, and it couldbe applied to any type of data, including color.andM;Compression ratios depend on the contone data content of the completePostScript page.andP;  They vary from about 5:1 for a 2-MB file to 14:1 for a20-MB file.andP;  Compression is performed at about 2 MB per minute of input data,with decompression at similar speeds; both compression and decompression arecontrolled by the CommsNet software.andM;Transmission speeds on dial-up lines at 14.4 kilobaud are around 100 KB perminute.andP;  When an average page of 10 MB is received at the Print Server, it isthen routed in three minutes, compressed in 1.5 minutes to 1 MB of data andtransmitted in ten minutes.andP;  Decompression takes a further 1.5 minutes permegabyte and typesetting about 10 minutes, for a total of 26 minutes perpage.andP;  There are optimum times based on a dialup line of 14.4 kilobaud, whichseldom happens.andP;  Page transmission is over standard phone lines to the remotesites, with the communications software handling noise on the phone lines andmaking sure that the line doesn't drop.andM;Diwan claims that it has had no difficulties with this low-cost approach, andthat the paper has now completely replaced the remaining Megastream andKilostream lines still used by the Pagefax units.andP;  Ironically, until veryrecently Megastream had been used locally between the High Holborn productionoffice and the printing site in East London.andM;The next version of the software will combine data compression and automaticdial-up, to compress and transmit pages on the fly.andM;Spooling and routing.andP;  In the communications zone, various Macintoshes managethe spooling, routing, compression and transmission of pages.andP;  As soon as ajob is spooled from the page makeup zone to the AppleShare print spooler (aMacintosh IIfx with a 2-GB hard disk), the Macintosh IIfx-based Routersoftware picks it up and distributes it to the appropriate file server forthe remote sites, automatically numbering the pages as it does so.andM;The paper has two of these Routers, which build page maps automatically basedon information for editorial page numbers provided by the systemadministrator.andP;  The Page-Router processes each page spooled by the printserver by making a copy of the PostScript version of the page to a number ofdestination folders on the local AppleShare File Server, one foldercorresponding to each site at which the page is to be printed.andP;  The number ofcopies is controlled by the user-configurable page map, which is set up atthe start of each day's production and defines for each page the list ofdestinations to which the page is to be transmitted.andP;  It also specifies foreach page the folio number to be generated.andP;  In addition, the page mapscontrol data flow.andM;Three sites are currently online, with Casablanca, New York and Frankfurt yetto be installed.andP;  A Macintosh IIx holds ads until the page is ready fortransmission.andP;  The file serves can queue jobs to multiple file servers ordirectly to a remote image server, although this is not a common practice.andM;Transmission and broadcast printing have been crucial to this newspaper.andP;  Ithas three to four editions each day with different page numbering anddifferent page sizes.andM;The link with Hyphen has made the low-cost boradcasting viable, since Diwanfound the Adobe RIP unable to cope with the file querying and queuing.andO;Problems encountered in trying to resolve this trouble led Diwan to contactHyphen, with whom it has worked closely on the routing aspects of the system.andO;The Hyphen RIP and Macintosh server are operator independent: the RIPcontinually queries the arrival folder on the file server for pages ready foroutput.andP;  The query routine essentially looks from the RIP backward to theMacintosh to allow continual output on the imagesetters.andP;  The transmissionand compression (i.e., CommsNet) are Diwan's own developments, with routingand page numbering software developed jointly by Diwan and Hyphen.andM;Operating speeds.andP;  Pages are transmitted at 14-15 kilobits per second,sending compressed data via Dowty Trailblazer modems, which can go at 18,000bits per second.andP;  The modems are driven by Diwan's communications software,which compensates for noise on the line and for line drops and similarinterference.andP;  Diwan is collaborating with British Telecom International toupgrade the system to operate at 256 kilobits per second to transmit data viasatellite to the Middle East.andP;  The use of satellite transmission is currentlyunder investigation.andM;Electronically created graphics are held as EPSF files, whereas all scannedimages--either news graphics or scanned art--are held as TIFF files.andP;  Thesoftware endeavors to detect the TIFF files of scanned ads and delete them,but not the scanned news pictures.andM;Overall there are three CommsNet Macintosh SE/30s handling Jeddah's pages,and two each for Marseilles, London and Frnakfurt.andM;Imagesetting is carried out at all locations on Hyphen software RIPs runningon Mac IIs, each of which is configured to spool from a separate destinationfolder on the file server.andP;  Casablanca will be online by the time thisarticle goes to press.andM;When a page arrives in the destination folder from the PageRouter, it isprinted and then deleted from the folder.andP;  The page is then faxed to theprinting sites.andP;  In some offices, there will still be a reliance on Pagefaxtransmission for a limited period.andM;Destination folders for Marseilles, London and Jeddah are spooled bycommunications Macs running CommsNet.andP;  When a page arrives from thePageRouter it is automatically transferred to CommsNet and compressed.andP;  Thecorresponding destination CommsNet is automatically dialed and the page istransmitted to it and deleted from the local Mac.andP;  For increased throughput,two or more communicating Macs can be used for each destination.andM;At the Marseilles, London and Jeddah receiving sites, Macs equipped with thereceiving version (as opposed to the transmission version) of CommsNetdecompress the page and move it to a folder on the local AppleShare fileserver Mac.andP;  This folder is spooled by one or more local Hyphen RIPs, whichprint and delete each page when it arrives.andM;System management in London is basically electronic, with a couple of peopleto monitor the process and correct any problems that may come up.andP;  Once thepages arrive at the remote file server, the final output is controlled bysoftware developed by Diwan and Hyphen for the bidirectional flow ofinformation between the file server and the RIP.andP;  Final output is on Ultreengines at all of the remote sites.andM;Diwan's approach to broadcast printing has evolved from work done on behalfof Al Hayat originally and Asharq Al-Awsat more recently.andP;  The latterpublishes in either cities per day, soon to be eleven, including London.andP;  Thenew system will replace the existing Crosfield Pagefax system at SaudiResearch for Asharq Al-Awsat.andP;  This system was the original means of pagetransmission and is now used to handle pages for New York, Casablanca andFrankfurt, which are not yet using the complete Diwan/Hyphen system.andP;  thePagefaxes are also rented to other London-based titles and are expected tocontinue in this function after Saudi Research has ceased to use them forAsharq Al-Awsat's pages.andM;Average output time per page with the Hyphen RIP and Ultre engines isapproximately ten minutes.andP;  It is worth noting that some of Asharq Al-Awsat'spages go up to 25 to 30 MB when they include high-resolution line art indisplay ads, so output speeds do have considerable variance.andM;File management.andP;  The latest development that Diwan is working on at AsharqAl-Awsat is a product to handle file management of all stories on the system.andO;This software has only been developed for wire service stories, but Diwanplans to implement it as part of the entire editorial system.andM;The NewsNet Editor is based on the Macintosh IIci and is essentially a datamanager to allow editors to build individual filters for baskets to a maximumof 99 (see above).andP;  The system would provide automatic generation of storybaskets, or reference baskets for retrieval of stories from the current issueor from the week's editions of the paper.andP;  An interface to the newspaper'sarchive system, also developed by Diwan, will be part of the final package,allowing the user to specify editions or spans of time in the retrievalcriteria.andM;The NewsNet Editor can generate customized long or short directories withcontrol over the numbers of lines of the qualified stories displayed.andP;  TheEditor presently manages wire service stories, and it will handle both Arabicand English.andP;  It is extremely fast, providing a continual update of storiesavailable in both languages.andP;  Stories can be edited and worked on locally,but at this stage they are not part of the overall editorial copy flow untilthe editor says so.andM;The subeditor function is not so much a feature of Asharq Al-Awsat as it isfor other papers.andP;  Asharq Al-Awsat has a linear organization to preventconflicts and to keep overall control with the paper's editors.andM;Using the Editor to find stories on President Bush, 27 out of 1,728 storiesthat met this criteria were listed in a matter of seconds.andP;  More complexselections (e.g., Martin, tennis, titles) were similarly swift.andP;  These listsare updated in real time so that the paper can create special windows foreach subject area, with locally defined sort criteria for news management.andO;Stories from remote services with &quot;more to come&quot; are automatically mergedwith the appropriate previously transmitted versions, with a flag to the userthat more information has come in.andM;The Editor is written in C.andP;  It uses the Mac's windowing system to remember auser's window on the screen, so that it opens the lists and criteria asconfigured with each editor's logon settings.andP;  The user can cut and pastebetween Editor windows and the editorial and/or page makeup zones of Diwan'ssystem, with automatic alerts for updates as stories come in.andP;  The NewsNetEditor and the NewsNet Manager (the aspect that handles local listmanagement) will be elements of NewsNet II, now complete and due for releasein September.andM;Future developments.andP;  One possible future development including Hyphen atSaudi Research is to port the Page-Router to a Sun Sparcstation also runningAppleShare Printer Server and File Server emulators, to improve systemthroughput, should this become necessary.andP;  This will replace the twoPageRouters and the File Server Macs in London.andP;  Multiple edition handlingfor each day's production is also being worked on.andP;  Each page to be routedwill be individually printed from the page makeup package with a namecorresponding to its page number and a code for the edition in which it is toappear.andM;Soon, automatic proofing and delayed routing will provide a local page proofto be made as soon as the page is spooled.andP;  The page will then be routedeither after a fixed interval or upon command from the PageRouter when theproof has been approved.andP;  To provide more management information, a reportgeneration function will generate a report, listing times received, routedand printed.andP;  This will be output to a local laser printer for all pages fora each edition.andM;Although the problems of setting Arabic are a world unto themselves, solvingcomposition has been secondary for Diwan at Asharq Al-Awsat.andP;  The crucialproblem there was to provide a method whereby the paper could print thedifferent versions of its paper in four remote locations.andP;  The problem issomewhat simplified by the absence of jumped stories, but nonetheless, whatDiwan has achieved, with Hyphen's help, is no mean feat.andM;For the future, Diwan is working on its NewsNet Editor product and is alsoinvolved along with other suppliers in automating production of SaudiResearch and Marketing's magazine titles.andM;Diwan and Hyphen have collaborated to provide an efficient and productivenewspaper system entirely based on off-the-shelf components, and with astandard output.andP;  PostScript's supposed lack of speed for this application issignificantly outweighed by the fact that it provides a common datastructure, a means of unifying the system components and the newspaper'svarious elements.andP;  This is a daily broadsheet newspaper assembled inelectronic form with a foundation of standard products, output entirely inPostScript and broadcast printed around the world.andP;  And it's in Arabic.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
