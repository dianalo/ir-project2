The correlation function, normalized to the square ofthe distance between the walls, typically exhibits a similarity property:its behavior as a function of time, friction, temperature, and wall separationreduces to a function of one simple combination of those four quantities.The limiting cases of low and high friction are investigated in detail,with explicit expressions being derived for the spectrum.</TEXT></DOC>
