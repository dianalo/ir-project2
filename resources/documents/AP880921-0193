The conclusion came from a detailed analysis of data from aclinical trial begun 18 years ago by the Health Insurance Plan ofGreater New York.   Researchers said it is the first comprehensive study to provethat mammograms can be an important lifesaving screening techniquefor women under the age of 50.   ``This is the first statistically significant evidence of thebenefits'' for this age group, said Kenneth Chu, lead author of theNCI analysis.   Evidence has been clear for some time, he said, that there is asignificant benefit in mammographic screening among women aged 50and above. But whether these benefits apply to women between theages 40 and 50 has been a matter of controversy, Chu said.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Reagan administration has used the CIA tofoment civil unrest in Nicaragua and in the process has damagedefforts at a long-term peace accord between the leftist governmentand the Contra rebels, House Speaker Jim Wright says.   In a highly unusual disclosure, Wright told reporters Tuesdaythat the CIA has employed agents covertly in Nicaragua to organizeand promote anti-government rallies and protests.   Wright, speaking at his regular daily news conference, saidCongress has received ``clear testimony'' that the CIA has sought``to provoke an overreaction'' by the Managua government.   Elaborating later in an interview, the speaker added: ``Agentsof our government have assisted in organizing the kinds ofanti-government demonstrations that have been calculated tostimulate and provoke arrests.''   Wright said the CIA had made the admission under questioningfrom members of Congress. Presumably, the disclosure would havecome in closed-door oversight sessions of the congressionalintelligence committees, most of whose work is classified.</TEXT><DATELINE>SOUTH ROXANA, Ill.

The U.S. Justice Department announced Tuesday that a grand jurycleared Mayor W. Wilson Goode, other city officials and police ofcriminal wrongdoing in the bombing of a west Philadelphia rowhouse.   The police bombing _ approved by Goode _ and resulting fire thatofficials allowed to rage out of control left 11 members of theradical group MOVE dead and 61 homes destroyed.   ``There's always going to be some nagging doubts about whetherjustice prevailed in this case,'' said William H. Brown III, thechairman of the mayor's special investigative commission, whichfound Goode ``grossly negligent'' for his role in the events of May13, 1985.   Assistant Attorney General William Bradford Reynolds, head ofthe Justice Department's civil rights division, said in Washingtonthat evidence was insufficient to seek indictments on any civilrights violations.</TEXT></DOC>
