BarnesStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 02/20/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> GE LABOR CBS CCBTELECOMMUNICATIONS, BROADCASTING, TELEPHONE, TELEGRAPH (TEL) </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   National Broadcasting Co. is seeking major concessions in forthcoming contract talks with some of its union work force that could set the pace for further cost-cutting by all three television networks.    The General Electric Co. unit has presented negotiators for the National Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians -- which represents about 2,800 NBC technicians and news employees, or about a third of NBC's payroll -- with several tough proposals that could reduce the network's union ranks and increase the use of lower-paid, nonunion employees.    The talks are being closely watched for possible precedents by management and union employees at NBC's rivals, Capital Cities/ABC Inc. and CBS Inc., where negotiations with writing and other technical unions are pending or under way. The outcome of NBC's talks could particularly affect the three networks' continuing efforts to cut news organization costs.    The hard line by NBC, under its new GE management, is prompting some grumbling in the rank-and-file about union busting, worries over poorer-quality broadcasts and talk of a possible strike. Since becoming chairman and chief executive officer of GE in 1981, John F. Welch Jr. has cut more than 100,000 jobs from its payroll.    Unhappy about initial proposals, the NBC union is seeking a strike authorization vote from its members, a standard positioning tactic. Likewise, NBC has set up &quot;strike schools&quot; to prepare managers to take over union positions in the event of a strike. Formal talks are scheduled to begin in early March in San Diego on a new contract to replace a four-year NBC contract that expires March 31.    At preliminary talks last month with the union's negotiators, NBC proposed, among other things, that it be able to hire more free-lance employees for remote broadcasts such as sports events; hire more union employees on a daily basis, rather than longer term; and use outside contractors, union or nonunion, for designing, constructing and testing any new broadcasting equipment and facilities.    Thomas F. Kennedy, the union's chief network negotiator, said the proposals would have a &quot;very devastating effect on the employment of NBC (union) members nationwide.&quot; NBC &quot;wants more than the other two networks,&quot; he said. But he added, &quot;you expect them to come in with demands that are out of sight&quot; in the initial round of proposals.    In news, the union is resisting an NBC proposal to allow on-air reporters to operate cameras and other equipment, a move that would, for example, reduce the need for separate camera or sound personnel on some assignments. The proposal was successfully challenged by network correspondents in American Federation of Television and Radio Artists contract talks last year. But networks are pressing for the changes in light of a new generation of compact video electronics equipment that reduces the need for larger news-gathering crews.    NBC News also wants to be able to buy material from domestic, independent news-gathering concerns, a practice currently prohibited under the existing contract with the union.    About 350 of the union's NBC employees work full time for NBC News, accounting for about 30% of the division's work force.    NBC's tough position comes despite a year of record profits at the first-ranked network. &quot;This is a very high-risk business,&quot; said Day Krolik III, NBC's vice president for labor negotiations. &quot;You've got to look at the long-term position. What we're really trying to do is find ways of operating more efficiently.&quot;    The current NBC contract covers wages and benefits for the union's engineers, cameramen, graphic artists and many news producers and writers, among others, in NBC's network and local station operations. Mr. Krolik said the current average salary for an NBC member of the union is about $65,000, with salaries ranging from $35,000 to $155,000.    This summer, CBS will begin contract talks with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers union, which represents about 1,700 CBS technicians under a contract expiring Sept. 30. About 350 of CBS News's 1,225 full-time employees are in a union, mostly the IBEW, a spokeswoman said. As reported earlier, CBS News is seeking cuts of as much as $50 million in its $300 million annual budget.    Both CBS and Capital Cities/ABC also are negotiating jointly with the Writers Guild of America on a new contract for about 500 television and radio news writers, editors and other union personnel employed by the two companies at their networks and some stations. The current three-year contract expires March 1. Guild negotiators complain that both companies are taking a hard line in the talks, proposing, among other things, elimination of the arbitration option in employee dismissals. </TEXT></DOC>
