Amid mounting signs of a broad effort to end the problemof hostages in Lebanon, Mr. Bush clearly signaled that hewould like Israel to act soon to demonstrate that it iswilling to meet the demands of those still holding 11Westerners in Lebanon. The hostage-holders are insisting onfreedom for several hundred Lebanese Shiites and Palestinianfighters held by Israel and its allies in southern Lebanon.</LP><TEXT>   Without mentioning Israel by name, Mr. Bush seemed torefer to those being held by Israel as &quot;hostages&quot; rather thanprisoners. &quot;I've said that all countries holding hostagesought to release them,&quot; Mr. Bush told reporters here, wherehe is vacationing. Asked whether Israel now should make somespecific move, he replied: &quot;People that are not held underprocedures of law but have been taken hostageI just hope thatwe soon wake up in this world and recognize that holdinghostages is a counterproductive way to make a statement ofpolicy or for any other reason.&quot;   Mr. Bush spoke just hours after Lebanese radicals releasedAmerican Edward Tracy, who had been in captivity almost fiveyears, and Frenchman Jerome Leyraud, who was seized just lastweek. The loosely affiliated cells of Shiite radicals holdingWesterners in Lebanon had been indicating for days that theywould release an American. The hostage-holders claimed therelease would be a sign they want to bring the hostage issueto a close.   The release of the Frenchman may, however, have been amore optimistic sign. He appeared to have been seized byrogue Shiites who flatly declared that they were acting toshort-circuit the process of releasing Western hostages. Thefact that he was released so promptly is an indication thatShiite religious and political leaders in Lebanon, perhapsworking in cooperation with Syrian forces now in control ofmuch of Lebanon, acted swiftly to squelch opposition tohostage releases.   Hopes were raised originally when British hostage JohnMcCarthy was released last week with a message to the UnitedNations linking an end to the hostage crisis to freedom forthe captives held by Israel.   For its part, Israel said that it is prepared to act,though probably not as swiftly as Mr. Bush is urging. Israeldeclared yesterday that it is willing to free its captives,but only after Israeli soldiers missing in Lebanon areaccounted for.   Interviewed on NBC's &quot;Meet the Press,&quot; Israel's deputyforeign minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, emphasized that sevenIsraeli soldiers, their bodies, or proof of their deaths bereleased before Israel frees its Lebanese prisoners and SheikAbdul Karim Obeid, spiritual leader of the Hezbollah, theprincipal Shiite religious and political organization inLebanon. Sheik Obeid was abducted by Israeli commandos in1989, and Mr. Netanyahu described him as Israel's &quot;trumpcard.&quot;   &quot;We are prepared to offer the Lebanese prisoners held inIsrael to effect the release and safe homecoming of our boys,our MIAs, our POWs. If, in the process, Western hostages cancome free as well, that's fine by us,&quot; Mr. Netanyahu said.   Of course, glimmers of mass hostage releases have come andgone before, and there is ample reason for skepticism thatthe hostage problem finally can be ended now. But PresidentBush appeared to be doing whatever he could yesterday tocapitalize on the latest opportunity to coax the hostageordeal to a clear conclusion.   In addition to urging Israel to act, Mr. Bush alsostrongly suggested that relations with Iran can improve if itacts now to help free Westerners still held in Lebanon. &quot;I'dlike to express our appreciation to the government of Iran,which used its influence with the Lebanese groups involved inorder to gain the unconditional release of these hostages,&quot;Mr. Bush said in a statement to reporters. He also thankedSyria and Lebanon for their help, and added: &quot;We call uponthe governments with influence on this issue to build on thispositive move and work for the release of all hostages,regardless of their nationality, and for an accounting ofthose who may have died while in captivity.&quot;   Mr. Bush said that in the current round of efforts to freehostages, there has been &quot;newfound cooperation&quot; from othergovernments. One reason for this cooperation, Mr. Bush said,may be that the U.S. is leading efforts to convene a newinternational peace conference to settle the Palestinianissue and end the state of war between Israel and Arabcountries.   In the past, there have been releases of one or twohostages at a time before the process collapsed, apparentlybecause of internal Lebanese and Shiite politics or angeramong the hostage-holders because they haven't reaped moreimmediate rewards.   Mr. Bush also has signaled before that Israel should freeits captives. Israel has made some smaller-scale releases ofprisoners, which it said hasn't produced any result. Also,Mr. Bush has suggested in the past that hostage releaseswould improve ties to Iran, but Iran hasn't displayed eitherthe interest or the ability to force freedom for hostages.</TEXT></DOC>
