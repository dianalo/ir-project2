The strike, which began Sunday, has halted passenger rail services and about 30% of the country's freight transport. A prolonged stoppage would seriously hurt some of Canada's major exports, including grain, coal, forest products and sulfur.    The two sides were urged to return to the bargaining table by federal Labor Minister Pierre Cadieux, who appointed the government's senior mediator, William Kelly, to assist the negotiators. Mr. Cadieux told reporters that if the mediation effort fails, &quot;the government will intervene&quot; in the dispute.    The strike started after a breakdown in negotiations between the unions, which represent more than 47,000 rail workers, and the two main railroads, government-owned Canadian National Railways and CP Rail, a unit of Montreal-based Canadian Pacific Ltd.    Douglas Brunton, an official with the Alberta Wheat Pool, a farmers' cooperative, called the rail system &quot;an essential service,&quot; because Western Canadian grain farmers don't have a viable alternative to rail for shipping their products. The Alberta pool urged Parliament to enact legislation ordering the rail workers to return to their jobs. The last Canadian rail strike in 1973 lasted for two weeks before Parliament enacted back-to-work legislation.    The Canadian Wheat Board, which handles the nation's exports of wheat, oats and barley, said it only has enough grain stocks at West Coast terminals for about six vessels. About 25 vessels are scheduled to dock this week at the terminals, which are usually supplied by grain trains from Western Canada.    Armand Passaretti, chairman of the Associated Rail Unions, a grouping of nine separate rail unions, said that the unions wouldn't suspend the strike because the talks were under way. He said the two sides remain far apart on several key issues, including job security and wages. The previous wage contract expired Dec. 31.    Guy Dufresne, senior vice president of Consolidated-Bathurst Inc., a Montreal-based forest products concern, said, &quot;We're hoping the government will intervene as soon as possible.&quot; He said the company depends on the railroads for about 75% of its shipments of newsprint and wood pulp, particularly to the U.S.    He said the walkout was forcing the company to find additional trucks to ship its products or warehouse space for storage. Some mills could last for a time, but at other facilities, after &quot;a week (of the strike) we'll be really hurting,&quot; he said.    Howard Bernier, an official at the CCR division of Noranda Inc., a Toronto-based minerals and forest products company, said CCR has already asked some of the 1,050 employees at its copper smelter in Montreal to take holidays this week because of a shortage of raw materials. If the rail strike continues for a week, he predicted, &quot;there will certainly be some layoffs.&quot;    A spokesman for General Motors of Canada Ltd., a unit of General Motors Corp., Detroit, said, &quot;We're in pretty good shape,&quot; since only about 10% of its incoming parts are handled by rail. The rest is shipped by truck.    As for finished cars, about 35% are shipped by rail out of the company's big assembly operations in Oshawa, Ontario, with the balance handled by truck. The spokesman said the company is planning on increasing truck transport and won't reduce operations for now.    Victor Lonmo, president of the Automotive Parts Manufacturers' Association of Canada, said that most auto parts are shipped by truck, but the problem could be serious for larger parts that are usually transported by rail. He cited the example of truck chassis shipped by rail from St. Catharines, Ontario, to St. Louis.    The problem is compounded by the &quot;just-in-time&quot; manufacturing system, which reduces inventories at plants to a minimum. &quot;There aren't a lot of parts sitting around like there used to be,&quot; Mr. Lonmo said.    The strike forced passengers at Via Rail Canada Inc., the government-owned passenger rail service, to seek alternative forms of transportation. Also halted by the strike was commuter rail service in the Toronto and Montreal areas.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Canadian Pacific shares closed at $20.75, down 50 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
