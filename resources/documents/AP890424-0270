RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court today refused to revive alawsuit by consumer activist Ralph Nader, environmentalists andothers seeking a government ban on the chemical Alar.   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that threw outthe suit.   Alar, sold by Uniroyal Chemical Co., is used primarily toenhance the color and uniform ripening of apples.   Some studies have shown it can cause cancer in animals, and maybe a serious health risk to humans, particularly children.   But the Environmental Protection Agency on Jan. 6, 1987,rejected a plea by environmentalists and others to ban Alar. Theagency said it lacked sufficient evidence to order it off themarket.   Instead, 10 days later the EPA lowered by one-third theallowable amounts of the chemical that may remain as residues inapples. The new rule was designed as an interim measure to permitmore time for the agency to study Alar's effects.   Nader and the others whose petition was denied by the EPA fileda federal suit aimed at forcing the agency to ban Alar.   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last October threw out thesuit for procedural reasons.   The appeals court said the EPA could be exposed to a barrage oflawsuits if forced to go to court every time it denied a petitionlike the one submitted for Alar.   ``EPA could conceivably be forced to appear continually inappellate courts defending regulations long established thatparties failed to contest at the time of their promulgation,'' the9th Circuit court said. ``If Congress had intended such a result,it is unlikely it would have prescribed a fixed deadline forappeals from regulations.''   The Bush administration urged the Supreme Court to reject theenvironmentalists' bid to revive their suit.   Citizens who file petitions with the environmental agency shouldnot be allowed to bypass administrative procedures established byfederal law, Justice Department lawyers said.   In other action, the court:   _ Turned away an appeal by deposed Philippine PresidentFerdinand Marcos and his wife, Imelda, aimed at overturning a courtorder freezing their assets.   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that, in effect,requires the Marcoses to defend themselves in a lawsuit filed bythe Philippine government. The lower court order also bars themfrom transferring most of their alleged vast wealth.   _ Agreed to review a judge's order raising property taxes tohelp pay for racially desegregating public schools in Kansas City,Mo.   The justices said they will hear arguments that the judgeoverstepped his authority when imposing the tax hike for allproperty within the city's school district.   _ Let stand a ruling that a federal judge may overrule federalenvironmental officials and permit use of an allegedly dangerouspesticide.   The justices, without comment, rejected an appeal byenvironmentalists and organized labor in a case, involving thepesticide dinoseb, of particular importance to farmers in Idaho,Oregon and Washington state.   _ Left intact a $101 million refund the nation's telephonecompanies were ordered to pay customers for excessive charges in1978.   The court, without comment, rejected arguments that the FederalCommunications Commission overstepped its authority in ordering therefunds.   _ Agreed to decide whether the government may tax as income thedeposits that utility companies demand from customers to ensurepayment of future bills.   The court said it will hear a Bush administration appeal in acase involving an Indiana electric utility.   _ Agreed to decide whether an Indian tribe can prosecute membersof other tribes for crimes on its reservation.   The court said it will review a ruling that gives the Salt RiverPima-Maricopa Community in Arizona authority to prosecute aCalifornia man accused in the fatal shooting of a 14-year-old boy.   _ Agreed to judge the validity of a federal law allowing the useof abandoned rail line rights-of-way for nature trails.   The court said it will decide in a case from Vermont whether thelaw unconstitutionally deprives some property owners of the use oftheir land without providing ``just compensation.''   The Alar case is Nader vs. EPA, 88-1146.</TEXT></DOC>
