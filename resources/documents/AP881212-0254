Ultimate cost to clean up the industry: between $50 billionand $100 billion.   Contact the Bush administration, the new landlords.   If 1988 was a year of decision for the American electorate, for aNavy captain in the Persian Gulf, for millions of amnesty-seekingaliens and for countless others, then it was also a year ofindecision for those charged with resolving the multibillion-dollarsavings and loan crisis.   A result of economic recession here in the Southwest, high-flyingantics of speculators and developers, and widespread fraud in theearly 1980s, the Sandamp;L problem has grown over the past few years froma million-dollar headache to a billion-dollar migraine that mayhinder budget and no-new-taxes planning by the Bush administration.   ``The thrift industry's problems alone now demand funding on amassive scale,'' said William Seidman, chairman of the FederalDeposit Insurance Corp. and one of the nation's top bankingregulators. ``That funding requirement appears to exceed thecombined resources devoted to Europe under the Marshall Plan, andthe bailouts of Lockheed, Chrysler, Penn Central and New York City.''   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulates Sandamp;Ls, launcheda much-heralded ``Southwest Plan'' in 1988 to begin folding thelosers into money-making thrifts.   But analysts have criticized the slow pace of the plan, and thecost. Fifty-four grossly insolvent Sandamp;Ls were sold, but at least 164remained unresolved.   ``It's full-steam ahead, and we're going as fast as we can getthe cases done,'' said Carl Hoyle, FHLBB spokesman.   Federal prosecutors launched one of the biggestwhite-collar-crime task forces in history, taking over almost anentire floor of an FBI building in Dallas. But the pace of majorindictments has been slow, and the statute of limitations on bankfraud (five years) was hanging over the effort.   And despite the dire economic predictions and an ``indecisionmeter'' adding $1 billion a month to the cost of resolving the Sandamp;Lproblem, Congress opted to continue to study the problem, ratherthan raise taxes to close out the cases.   ``We were calculating the cost of closure at $20 billion threeyears ago,'' said industry analyst Warren Heller of Veribanc, Inc.``They didn't have the $20 billion back then either.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Year-End Editions</NOTE></DOC>
