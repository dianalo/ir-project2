The Fed's boost to 6.5% from 6% in the discount rate, the fee it charges for loans to banks and other financial institutions, pushed rates on Treasury bills, bank certificates of deposit and commercial paper to their highest levels since mid-October, just before the stock market crash.    Other interest rates are sure to follow. A discount-rate boost signals across-the-board increases to come in the prime rate and such consumer borrowing fees as home-equity loans and adjustable rate mortgages. Banks might boost their prime rate, or base rate as some call it, as early as this week, analysts said.    Speculation that the Fed might boost rates still higher to thwart inflation depressed the bond market. Prices of some actively traded 30-year bonds dropped nearly one point, or about $10 for each $1,000 face amount. The yield rose to just under 9.2% from 9.11% Monday.    But that yield still remains well below its peak last October, suggesting that investors are less worried about inflation or excess credit demand than they were just before last year's stock market crash. Yields were as high as 10.23% last Oct. 15.    Yesterday, stock prices tumbled in relatively light trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 28.27 lower at 2079.13. Declining issues on the New York Stock Exchange swamped gainers nearly 4 to 1. Big Board volume of 200.7 million shares was bloated by quick-turnaround trades by Japanese investors to capture forthcoming dividends; &quot;regular&quot; volume was about 142 million shares.    Still, some viewed the stock market's drubbing as temporal. Don Yarling, a partner in the Chicago money-management firm of Lemley-Yarling Co., argued that stock prices could go higher, now that the much-feared interest-rate rise has occurred.    &quot;The fear of higher rates has kept the stock market in a state of malaise and lethargy for weeks,&quot; he said. &quot;Now that it's history, the market may trade on something else, such as the strength of the dollar or strong corporate earnings.&quot;    Higher interest rates made the dollar much more attractive to foreign investors, who bid up the currency to its highest levels in more than a year. And dollar traders said further strengthening is likely. In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted at 1.9210 marks and 135.18 yen, compared with 1.8996 marks and 133.75 yen late Monday. In Tokyo Wednesday, the U.S. currency opened at 134.93 yen.    Currency traders led the significant faction of Wall Street experts who viewed the Fed's discount-rate action positively. They were pleased the Fed shifted its attention from stabilizing the dollar through intervention in foreign-exchange markets to fighting inflation. &quot;It's a license to buy dollars,&quot; said Yani M.A. Budiman, vice president of foreign exchange at Chemical Bank, New York. &quot;I personally think the dollar can go much higher.&quot;    But some said the Fed's action raises questions about the direction of interestrates world-wide. John Lipsky, director of international bond-market research at Salomon Brothers Inc., said he expects further interest-rate boosts both here and abroad. &quot;Our own view of the U.S. economy makes us think this is not likely to be the final round of tightening by the Fed, and we expect to see a response by foreign central banks.&quot;    Suresh Bhirud, chief portfolio strategist at Oppenheimer andamp; Co., yesterday urged clients to adjust their portfolios to 20% cash from 15% in light of rising interest rates. He said the economy's strength had convinced him that Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan &quot;had to choose between being a Republican and establishing his credibility as an inflation fighter.&quot;    Meanwhile, Abby Joseph Cohen, an investment strategist at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., advised her clients last week to increase the cash portion of their portfolios to 10% from 5%. She said she was surprised that stock prices fell so sharply yesterday, because many market experts had been predicting a discountrate increase. &quot;Everyone was expecting it,&quot; she said. &quot;The only surprise was the timing.&quot;    ---   Charles W.
