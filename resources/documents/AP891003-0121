The first train of East German refugees will depart Prague forWest Germany some time after 8 p.m., said Rudolf Seiters, chief ofstaff to Chancellor Helmut Kohl.   It was the second time within a week that East Germany hadreluctantly agreed to allow its citizens to emigrate West. Lastweekend, about 7,000 refugees fled to the West from West Germanembassies in Poland and Czechoslovakia.   The agreement covers 4,700 East Germans inside the embassy andthousands more who raced to Czechoslovakia in hopes of gainingpassage to the West, but were unable to get into the overfilledembassy compound, Seiters said.   Earlier today, about 250 East Germans stormed past police andinto the West German Embassy, and witnesses said some refugees wereinjured. East Germany then blocked citizens from traveling toCzechoslovakia in an effort to stem the flow to the West.   Until today, East Germans needed neither a visa nor a passportto travel to Czechoslovakia. The state news agency ADN said thateffective immediately, such documents would be required. That willeffectively block ordinary citizens from going there.   The ADN dispatch said the move was based on reports indicating``that certain circles in West Germany are preparing provocationsin conjunction with the celebrations of our 40th anniversary'' onSaturday.   ADN did not say anything about changes in travel to Poland,where East Germans also have holed up in the West German Embassy.East Germans currently need government permission to travel toPoland.   In Bonn, chief government spokesman Hans Klein said East Germanleader Erich Honecker earlier had refused to talk to West GermanChancellor Helmut Kohl by telephone about the refugee crisis.   Honecker aides said that preparations for Saturday's 40thanniversary of the Communist nation precluded an ``appointment fora telephone call,'' Klein said.   The anniversary celebration, which is to include a visit bySoviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, comes amid perhaps EastGermany's most embarrassing diplomatic crisis: the exodus ofthousands of its citizens.   In another development, the Soviet Communist Party daily Pravdaaccused West Germany of interfering in East German affairs byallowing its embassies in Prague and Warsaw to grant asylum torefugees.   ``Political leaders of West Germany have made naked attempts tointerfere in the internal affairs of sovereign East Germany,''Pravda said.   Before today's announcment, East Germany had said last weekend'sexodus was a one-time occurrence and demanded that West Germanyexpel the thousands of other would-be emigres who subsequentlyconverged on the missions to follow their countrymen to WestGermany.   After breaking the police lines at the Prague embassy, the EastGermans scaled a 2-yard-high fence to join the approximately 4,500refugees already inside embassy grounds.   The crowd broke into the embassy after West Germany closed thecompound because of intense crowding, and hundreds of East Germanswaited outside, the numbers increasing hourly, witnesses said.   They said about 500 people reportedly gathered around theembassy, some even sitting on nearby rooftops.   Between 200 and 250 East Germans waiting outside the embassycompound finally stormed through barricades around the embassygarden fence, climbing into the compound, they said.   When the refugees battled police who tried to stop them, manywere injured, some from jumping from the fence, the witnesses said.The number of injured was not immediately known.   West German Foreign Ministry spokesman Peter Rothen told TheAssociated Press in Bonn that the situation in the embassy hadbecome ``unbearable. It's horribly crowded.''   After clashes late Monday evening between truncheon-wieldingpolice and East Germans trying to reach the embassy, police liftedtheir controls at the main gate, allowing them to enter butcontinuing to patrol the garden fence.   West German sources said the embassy had been closed at therequest of the German Red Cross, which was concerned aboutsanitation problems.   About 1,000 children were said by refugees to be among those inthe embassy. People were sleeping three to a bed in the tentsscattered across the embassy grounds, refugees said.   Czechoslovak government spokesman Miroslav Pavel said theswelling numbers of East Germans ``seriously upsets public order''in Prague and the government reserved the right to take``indispensable measures to maintain and restore public order.''   He said other embassies in the area, including the U.S. Embassy,had requested increased protection.   Pavel said in a statement carried by the official CTK newsagency that ``relevant Czechoslovak authorities'' had providednecessary supplies and ``humanitarian, medical and other technicalassistance.''   He criticized West Germany as irresponsible for allowing therefugees to enter the building after allegedly assuring EastGermany and Czechoslovakia that last weekend's situation would notbe repeated.   In the West German embassy in Warsaw, the number of East Germanswho have arrived in the past two days reached about 300, Rothensaid, but he acknowledged the number could be higher.   East Berlin restricted travel to Hungary after that country'sliberal leaders opened their border with Austria on Sept. 10 andthousands of East Germans fled West across it. More than 20,000have crossed through Hungary since then.   East Germans unable to reach Hungary then began converging onthe West German embassies in Poland and Czechoslovakia.   Poland and Hungary are two liberal Warsaw Pact nations growingincreasingly distant from such hard-line allies as Czechoslovakiaand East Germany.   The East German opposition group New Forum on Monday criticizedthe country's Communist leaders for agreeing to the weekendrelease, saying in a statement that East Germany is ``losing avillage every day.''   So far this year more than 120,000 East Germans have reachedWest Germany, where they are granted automatic citizenship. Theexodus of the mostly young, skilled workers has hurt East Germany'seconomy.   In Leipzig, East Germany, on Monday, nearly 20,000 peoplemarched to demand legalization of opposition groups and adoption ofdemocratic reforms in the country's largest such protest since 1953.   Witnesses said security officials followed the demonstration butdid not try to break it up.</TEXT></DOC>
