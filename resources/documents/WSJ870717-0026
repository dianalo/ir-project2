Purchasers of Saudi oil have been notified this week they won't be permitted to take all the oil that they had requested for August.    In Washington, a spokesman for Arabian American Oil Co., which produces Saudi Arabia's oil, said that the Persian Gulf kingdom is &quot;very serious about sticking to its production quota&quot; within the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. He wouldn't comment further.    Nor would the four U.S. shareholders of the Saudi-American consortium -- Chevron Corp., Exxon Corp., Texaco Inc. and Mobil Corp. -- confirm the notification. But sources close to the Aramco consortium said that the four companies were told Monday that they would be allocated oil for August purchases based on the 1.3 million barrels a day defined in their contract. The companies had asked to purchase several hundred thousand barrels a day more than that.    It wasn't immediately clear whether the Saudis will permit the Aramco companies to purchase some additional oil beyond the amounts defined in the contract negotiated early this year. &quot;But Saudi Arabia let the (Aramco) partners know that they wouldn't get their full nominations (requests for purchases) and would be allocated on a pro-rata basis,&quot; a source close to developments said.    Other purchasers -- including Japanese companies that recently negotiated new contracts with the Saudis -- were told the same thing, the source said. It is understood that July purchases won't be affected by the Saudi step and that August allocations will be based on volumes taken by the companies in the second quarter.    This is only the second time in recent months that the Saudis have held the Aramco companies' purchases to nearly contract levels. Until recently, however, some of the Aramco companies didn't want to take as much Saudi oil as specified in their contract because of the world oil glut. But recent increases in oil prices on world markets have made oil produced by OPEC particularly attractive at the official government selling prices based on OPEC's benchmark $18 a barrel.    Yesterday, futures prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange again advanced, with West Texas Intermediate crude for August delivery closing at $22.34 a barrel, up 19 cents. Although U.S. crudes generally are priced $1 to $1.50 a barrel higher than Mideast oil, the spot and futures prices for the West Texas oil are sharply higher than the official selling price of $17.52 a barrel for Arabian Light, the key Saudi grade.    &quot;Anything sold at the (OPEC) official selling price is a bargain,&quot; said Lawrence J. Goldstein, executive vice president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation.    Saudi Arabia's overseas stockpile will be cut in half to about 20 million barrels by late summer at a current sales rate of some 250,000 barrels a day, according to Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, an authoritative industry trade publication. But even as the Saudis trim their stockpile, some oil analysts see them using purchase allocations to try to prevent a new buildup of inventories by the oil companies. </TEXT></DOC>
