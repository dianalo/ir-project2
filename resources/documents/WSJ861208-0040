Moody's said it will review its single-A-3 rating on Brunswick's senior debentures and its Baa-1 rating on the convertible subordinated debentures of Ozite Corp. Brunswick, a Skokie, Ill.-based boat engine and recreational products company, spun off Ozite in the late 1970s but still is guarantor of $500,000 of Ozite debt. Moody's also said it reviewed and confirmed its Prime-2 rating on Brunswick commercial paper. Moody's said its review came in light of Brunswick's plan to buy Bayliner Marine Corp. and Ray Industries Inc., two pleasure-boat makers, for about $775 million. It said its review will focus on how quickly the company will reduce the increased debt load that will result from the acquisitions. Frederick J. Florjancic, vice president and chief financial officer of Brunswick, said the company is &quot;confident that strong profitability and cash flow from our existing businesses coupled with the profitability and cash flow of the companies we intend to acquire will more than enable us to service our debt requirement.&quot;    ---   FRUEHAUF CORP. -- Moody's lowered its ratings on senior debt and industrial revenue bonds of this maker of truck trailers and auto parts to single-B-3 from Baa-2, on its subordinated debt to single-B-3 from Ba-1 and on its convertible preferred to single-B-3 from Baa-3. The rating concern cited &quot;severe deterioration&quot; in the Detroit-based company's capital structure and debt-protection measurements resulting from a pending leveraged buyout. Fruehauf's acquisition by Fruehauf Holdings Inc., owned by Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. and certain Fruehauf executives, is due to be completed next Monday. A Fruehauf spokesman declined to comment on the Moody's action. Moody's also said it assigned a single-B-3 rating to Fruehauf Holdings' proposed $500 million issue of senior subordinated notes and debentures and the same rating to its proposed $267 million issue of cumulative exchangeable redeemable preferred.    ---   GILLETTE CO. -- Moody's said it lowered the commercial paper rating of the maker of razor blades and personal-care products to Prime-2 from Prime-1. The downgrading also applies to the Boston-based company's Gillette Capital Corp. subsidiary. About $370 million of debt is affected. Moody's cited a &quot;substantial increase&quot; in Gillette's leverage after it bought back 9.2 million common shares from Revlon Group Inc. for $558 million to end a takeover bid. Moody's said it is continuing to review the ratings for possible further downgrading because Gillette may buy back as many as an additional seven million shares and because the company may be the target of another takeover bid. A Gillette spokesman said the downgrading was expected because of the added debt. &quot;It will not impair our ability to borrow if we need to,&quot; he said. &quot;It will not have a detrimental effect.&quot;    ---   WEDTECH CORP. -- Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. said it lowered to double-C from single-B-minus the rating on the defense contractor's $115 million of subordinated debt. As previously reported, state and federal officials are investigating a possible role by current and former government officials in the company's obtaining of certain contracts. The company has said it expects to post a &quot;substantial&quot; third-quarter loss because publicity over the investigation has led to a drop in new contracts. Sandamp;P said that &quot;fallout&quot; from the investigation &quot;endangers the firm's liquidity, profitability and survival.&quot; The rating concern said the controversy has prompted the U.S. government to defer progress payments to Wedtech and undermined the company's ability to obtain financing. Wedtech officials declined to comment. </TEXT></DOC>
