Separately, a trade group said that Japanese vehicle exports rose in March but fell in the fiscal year ended March 31, the second consecutive annual decline.    In the housing-starts report, the Construction Ministry said starts rose 14.8% in March from a year earlier, to 137,483 units -- the 23rd consecutive monthly gain on a year-to-year basis. But after seasonal adjustment, March starts showed a 3% decline from February, to 140,128 units.    The decline marked the third consecutive month-to-month drop. William Sterling, senior economist with Merrill Lynch Japan Inc. in Tokyo, said the combined drop in 1988's first quarter was equivalent to a 16.9% decline on an annual basis.    The slowing in starts is in sharp contrast to 1987's second half, when they grew at record rates. Starts peaked last September at 155,985 units on a seasonally adjusted basis, or at an annual pace of 1,870,000 units, Mr. Sterling said. In the year ended March 31, starts rose 23.5%, going above the 1.7 million-unit level for the first time in 14 years.    That growth came in response to a decline in interest rates during the second half, which prompted a flood of mortgage applications. It also reflected government measures to stimulate domestic spending. The housing boom, in turn, triggered heavy consumer spending on household goods, which aided the strong second-half economic expansion. Inflation-adjusted gross national product grew 2% in the third quarter from the prior three months and 1.7% in the fourth quarter.    Economists have been watching housing starts this year for a sign that the rapid growth in the Japanese economy may be abating somewhat. Many have seen a slowdown in the building sector as a good sign, because it will ease inflation fears.    In the report on vehicles, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association said vehicle exports rose 3.9% in March from a year earlier, to 462,468 units in March, while exports of cars alone climbed 10.6%, to 300,513 units. Exports to the U.S. fell 3.8%, to 164,6893 units.    In the full fiscal year, overall exports declined 4.9%, to 6,268,000 units. Officials ascribed the decline to a drop in shipments to the U.S., which fell 11.3%, to 3,012,000 units.    Exports of cars alone to the U.S. fell 3.7%, to 2,214,000 units. As previously reported, Japanese auto makers failed to meet their quota on car exports to the U.S. in the just-completed fiscal year for the first time since the quotas were established in 1981.    Association officials noted that the yen's strength has caused price increases for cars sold in the U.S. and that major Japanese auto makers have begun production in the U.S.    Two other trade reports were released yesterday. In one of them, the Japan Iron and Steel Federation said the nation's steelmakers exported 2,126,000 metric tons of steel in March, down 8.8% from the year before. But in dollar terms, the exports rose 19.2%.    The federation said the increase in value reflected in part the fact that more-sophisticated steel products, which carry a higher price than basic goods, are accounting for an increasing share of the exports. Nonetheless, the dollar value was affected by the yen's rise over the past year; in yen terms, March exports rose only 0.1%.    March steel exports to the U.S. grew 1.4% in volume, to 415,000 tons.    In the other report, the Japan Foreign Trade Council said that export contracts concluded by 17 major Japanese trading houses fell 14.8% in March from a year earlier, in contrast to an increase of 16.7% in February. Import contracts declined a slower 2.5%, in contrast to February's 19.6% gain.    &quot;There is no doubt that behind this drop in exports is the yen's appreciation,&quot; an official of the trade association said.    In the fiscal year, export contracts fell 3.9%-the third consecutive annual decline -- while import contracts grew 8.5%.    The 17 companies handle about 50% of Japan's exports and 65% of its imports. The council's statistics provide an early indication of short-term trade trends for Japan. </TEXT></DOC>
