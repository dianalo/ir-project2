The Wall Street sales manager for SunMicrosystems happily expects to peddle $70 million ofworkstation computers this year, triple the pace of two yearsago.   But this technology boom worries many people in financialmarkets. Ten years ago, a trade in, say, American Telephone andamp;Telegraph stock usually would be routed through WilliamJohnston, a New York Stock Exchange specialist, or marketmaker. Now, he is losing business to off-exchange systemsthat match buyers and sellers electronically.</RE><TEXT>   Cheap microchips and electronic breakthroughs areundermining traditional ways of trading stocks, bonds andforeign currencies. Major banks, securities firms and moneymanagers are creating vast private networks that put powerfulinvestors in direct electronic contact with one another.   Financial middlemen and clerks are losing out, and theresulting controversy is all the sharper because the networksdon't cater to small investors. In addition, the shift oftrading away from organized exchanges circumvents much of theregulatory apparatus and thus weakens safeguards againstmarket manipulation.   But computerized trading systems can deliver what the proswant: lightning-quick speed, anonymity and bare-bonestransaction costs. As fast as human traders operate on WallStreet, electronic systems are quicker; they pair buy andsell orders in a fraction of a second. Big investors usingthe networks need not worry that information about theirtrades will leak out. Commissions run just two cents a share,less than half the typical rate paid by big institutions onexchanges -- and less than a tenth of what most smallinvestors pay.   And, unlike human brokers and clerks, computer networksdon't sleep. The New York Stock Exchange recently bowed topressure from its members and shelved plans to begin trading30 minutes earlier, at 9 a.m. But while the Big Board sticksto a basic 6 1/2-hour trading day, many electronic networkswork round the clock -- and their business is growing just asrelentlessly. Already, as much as 10% of stock trading isdone via high-tech networks.   Volume on Instinet and the Crossing Network, twoelectronic-trading subsidiaries of Reuters Holdings PLC, hasincreased at an annual average of 45% in the past five years.Their total trading now accounts for only about eight millionshares a day, about 4.4% of the Big Board's daily volume, butthat percentage is expected to keep climbing. Anotheroff-exchange network, Posit, trades three million shares aday in Big Board and Nasdaq stocks.   On Posit, which is jointly sponsored by Jefferies andamp; Co., aLos Angeles securities firm, and Barra, a Californiafinancial-services firm, potential buyers and sellers usecomputers to list their orders. At 11 a.m. and about 1:30p.m., the orders, nearly all involving 5,000 shares or more,are automatically matched up to produce completed trades. Foroperating the network, Jefferies pockets about $60,000 a day,with fewer headaches than come from running a traditionaltrading desk.   In the bond market, traders are using &quot;voice-recognitiontechnology&quot; -- computers programmed to recognize traders'voices and log in orders automatically, without any need topress buttons or write order slips. At Shearson LehmanBrothers Inc., trader Richard Weinberg utters commands suchas &quot;Size: three million&quot; to his specially programmed phoneand can complete a trade without lifting a finger.   &quot;This makes a world of difference,&quot; Mr. Weinberg says. Hecan complete a day's worth of trading and order processing by1:45 p.m., while rival firms take until 3 p.m. The immediateeffect, he says, is that the American Express Co. brokerageunit can increase its market share in the short-term debtinstruments that he trades. It also can eliminate clericalcosts.   But many people on Wall Street are fearful, with goodreason, of being shunted aside. For decades, stock and bondtrading has been a labor-intensive business, providing jobsfor armies of order clerks, traders' assistants andback-office recordkeepers as well as the traders themselves.Now, Wall Street is succumbing to a tide of automation likethat which swept through factories in the 1980s.   Securities-industry jobs have shrunk 21% since the peak of262,000 in the 1987 third quarter, according to theSecurities Industry Association. Although the firms cutpayrolls after the 1987 crash frightened small investors,experts say one of the biggest forces decimating WallStreet's yeomen is automation.   Eventually, even traders' jobs may be a target of WallStreet technology. Steven Gott, Shearson's top technologist,says: &quot;We're doing a lot of experimenting with black-boxtrading&quot; -- in effect, looking for ways to program computersso that an electronic system, a &quot;black box,&quot; can operate withthe savvy of a veteran trader.   The highest anxiety about this high-tech world is voicedby traditionalists at the Big Board. Even though many of itsmarket makers are millionaires, they fret privately about theerosion of their 200-year-old franchise. Publicly, they warnof the dangers of a fragmented market. They say smallinvestors, unable to use the new networks, could suffer frominferior pricing and fewer trading opportunities, especiallyin lightly traded issues, if big investors abandon theexchanges and route orders through off-exchange systems.   &quot;Shouldn't mom and pop get the same shake as Fidelity?&quot;asks Mr. Johnston, the specialist, referring to the giantmutual-fund group. Specialists such as Mr. Johnston note thatfive years ago, the London Stock Exchange switched to anelectronic trading system, but now the pricing of thinlytraded stocks is so poor that the exchange is consideringreappointing specialists to some shares.   Federal regulators, however, are generally giving a greenlight to new trading technology. &quot;Within the context oflegislation, let the markets define themselves,&quot; says WilliamHeyman, the Securities and Exchange Commission's head ofmarket regulation. &quot;We recognize that markets no longer needto be places.&quot;   Equally sanguine is Charles Lucas, a senior vice presidentat the Federal Reserve Bank of New York who monitors theinternational capital markets. Even though he findstechnology causing big changes in the bond and currencymarkets, he sees no reason to intercede. &quot;My bias is towardmarkets that are more and more competitive,&quot; he says.   The regulators are acquiescing in the trend largelybecause they have little choice. When off-exchange tradingbegan to explode in the 1980s and more and more trades weregoing on &quot;in the dark,&quot; outside of the view of exchanges andregulators, the regulators became worried. The SEC began toendorse new stock-trading systems to keep high-tech tradingunder its control. Big Board executives say the exchange'safter-hours trading session, launched in June, was a responseto a direct request from the SEC. A Big Board executive saysSEC officials &quot;thought they were losing their regulatory gripwith this stuff going overseas.&quot; The SEC declines to comment.   The most avid users of high-tech trading networks are thebig &quot;index&quot; funds, which buy and hold broad baskets of stocksfor pension funds and other large clients so as to match theperformance of market benchmarks such as the Standard andamp;Poor's 500-stock index. By some estimates, as much as 90% ofmajor index funds' trading is done either internally withinthe funds or through off-exchange systems.   &quot;Our preferred method of trading is the internalmarketplace, with no intermediaries,&quot; says Donald Luskin, avice chairman of Wells Fargo/Nikko Investment Advisers, whichmanages more than $50 billion in index funds. &quot;If that's notapplicable, we proceed up through a chain of usingintermediaries.&quot; He says Wells begins by looking for low-costways to trade through networks such as Instinet and Posit.Just about his last choice is through brokers and anexchange.   New technology also allows big institutions to make fulluse of options and futures markets, which have grown so bigand intricate as to require computers. Automation is rollingahead fastest in the currency market, in which an estimated$650 billion a day changes hands. Lacking any centralexchange, traders for international banks transmit buy andsell orders electronically. To gain an edge over rivals,banks are piling ever more sophisticated computers and datanetworks onto each trader's desk, sometimes spending $50,000a year per trader on technology.   In the past two years, Reuters has installed more than4,000 of its Dealing 2000-Phase 1 trading screens in banks.The Reuters system lets traders punch in up-to-the-secondprice quotes and then trade automatically, without speakingby phone or writing order tickets. Traders estimate that asmuch as a third of currency trades go through Reutersterminals, which cost up to $4,000 a month.   Trying to crack Reuters's grip on the market areCiticorp's Quotron Systems Inc. and Telerate Inc., which isowned by Dow Jones andamp; Co., the publisher of this newspaper.Both Quotron and Telerate have announced plans to team upwith various partners to develop a screen-based system thatwould let banks trade anonymously, something the Reuterssystems don't yet provide. Banks want anonymity when buyingor selling large currency positions.   At Citicorp's Citibank, Richard Jenkins, a currencytrader, seldom bothers anymore to bellow an order to anotherbank via telephone or &quot;squawk box.&quot; Instead, he types hisorders into a computer, which immediately posts Citibank'srates in green numerals on hundreds of terminals world-wide.   In much less time than it takes to read this sentence, aLondon trader one recent morning saw Mr. Jenkins's quote,liked it and hit a &quot;BUY&quot; button on his keyboard. Instantly,the green numerals on his screen flashed yellow, showing acompleted trade. A moment later, both traders moved to theirnext deal -- never having spoken as $10 million changedhands.   Even more advanced tactics are coming. &quot;If everyone hasthe same system, we lose our advantage,&quot; says Walter Foster,a vice president at Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. Since most bigbanks have skilled traders and abundant capital, says PeterFisher, an assistant vice president at the New York Fed, &quot;theonly way to compete is in managing the waterfall ofinformation that comes off your screen.&quot; Citibank isdeveloping an &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; computer system thatscans daily headlines, decides which nations' economies aredoing better or worse than expected and recommends currencytrades.   Wall Streeters expect technology, with its brutalefficiency, to continue to shave profits in many businessesdown to nothing while creating enormous profits in others.The winners will probably be math-trained traders usingworkstations to analyze markets and juggle risk, plus thefirms that build and own trading networks.   Typical of the new breed of trader is Michael T. Sosebee,a former Bechtel Corp. nuclear-power engineer who now tradesoptions at CRT Government Securities Ltd. Mr. Sosebee sayshis background in physics, mathematics and computer sciencehelps him run elaborate financial models on Apolloworkstation screens. Up-to-the-second graphs of option pricesand other statistical relationships flicker in green, purpleand red as Mr. Sosebee does what he calls &quot;painting pictureswith options.&quot; Some 50% of CRT's client orders are generatedby such computer programs, known as &quot;analytics,&quot; which findthe best ways to hedge bond portfolios.   In the government bond markets, automation is squeezingsmall brokerage firms that long acted as intermediaries tomaintain the anonymity of giant dealers such as SalomonBrothers and Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. Traditionally, the smallfirms get commissions of $39 for each $1 million trade, anamount that adds up because the trading tops $100 billion onmost days.   Tired of paying commissions, the government bond market'sbig players have formed EJV Brokerage Inc., a screen-basedsystem that largely eliminates human brokers. EJV officialssay their commissions are 30% to 80% below those ofconventional brokers. After starting operations in May, EJVis believed to have 2% to 5% of the market in active Treasuryissues. And it expects further growth.   Even in the wake of the recent scandal over Salomon'strading in government bonds, an EJV executive says, federalregulators haven't expressed any opposition to black-boxtrading systems.   &quot;Technology is like Shiva,&quot; says Lewis W. Bernard, aMorgan Stanley managing director. Like the Hindi god, heexplains, &quot;It is the creator and the destroyer.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
