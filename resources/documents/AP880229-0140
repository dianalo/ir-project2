(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Evan Mecham today became the firstgovernor in almost 60 years to face an impeachment trial as thestate's chief justice convened a jury of 30 state senators todecide whether to remove him from office.   First on the agenda was a series of motions, including one tothrow out the charges against Mecham, a Republican whose 13 monthsin office have also been scarred by a recall effort and a criminalindictment.   ``The Senate trial of Evan Mecham does not concern merely thisone officeholder, but instead addresses the very essence ofdemocracy in our state constitution,'' Senate Minority Leader AlanStephens, a Democrat, said in a floor speech shortly before thecourt convened.   ``We are really testing our form of government. Will we stand upand do our duty amid calls from the public to intimidate us?''   Senate leaders say they'll take up to two months to heartestimony and arguments before deciding whether the governor shouldbe removed and possibly barred from holding elective office.   Mecham, 63, also faces a March 22 criminal trial on six felonycharges of concealing a $350,000 campaign loan, and a May 17 recallelection.   Twenty-nine of the state's 30 senators were at desks in thebrown-walled chamber as the presiding officer, Arizona SupremeCourt Frank X. Gordon Jr., convened the Senate as an impeachmentcourt. A small gallery was packed with reporters and visitors, andthe trial was being broadcast on radio and television.   The state House was represented by a five member impeachmentboard of managers, or prosecutors, while Mecham himself stayed athis temporary office in suburban Glendale and was represented byseveral lawyers.   After the trial began, the Senate agreed on a voice vote to letthe governor's original lawyer, Murray Miller, withdraw from thecase. Miller was replaced by Washington attorney Jerris Leonardlast week in a surprise move.   A clerk read the impeachment articles, and the Senate thenconsidered and denied a defense motion seeking to haveconsideration of an article referring to the campaign loan delayeduntil after his criminal trial.   The Senate broke for lunch at noon while considering a motion tothrow out all charges.   Mecham maintains he'll be acquitted in both trials, win therecall election and return to the office he gave up to DemocraticSecretary of State Rose Mofford after he was impeached Feb. 5 on a46-14 House vote.   The senator absent this morning was Republican Hal Runyan, aRepublican who suffered a stroke in November.   At a news conference Saturday, Mecham said winning acquittal incriminal court is more important than persuading the Senate to keephim in office.   ``I could have my freedom taken away and be sent to jail if Iwere guilty (in criminal court). Doesn't that somehow seem to you... a little more important than the job as governor? It does tome,'' Mecham said.   The state Supreme Court on Friday refused an emergency requestby Mecham to intervene and delay the Senate trial until after thecriminal trial. The court planned to discuss Tuesday whether togrant an injunction, although several justices already have saidthey believe the court lacks jurisdiction.   Mecham said he planned to take the issue to federal court. A newattorney hired by Mecham last week, Thomas Crowe, said he woulddecide by Wednesday where the appeal would be filed.   The governor claims the impeachment trial threatens his right toa fair criminal trial because the Senate proceedings will not bebound by the same rules of evidence as a criminal court but will bewidely publicized to prospective jurors.   ``As governor of this state, I ask nothing more than is accordedto every garden-variety criminal,'' he said. ``Is this a starchamber or will we proceed under the time-tested constitutionalmandate that I be afforded all of my basic constitutional rights?''   The House has leveled 23 charges against Mecham accusing him ofconcealing the $350,000 loan, misusing $80,000 from the governor'sprotocol fund by lending it to his auto dealership and trying tothwart an investigation of an alleged death threat by a stateofficial against a witness before the grand jury that investigatedMecham.   Senate Majority Leader Bob Usdane said the Senate has decided tohear testimony on all charges even if it appears there could be avote to convict him on the first charges heard.   Prosecutor Paul Eckstein said he and co-counsel William Frenchplanned to begin with testimony on the allegation that Mechamordered Department of Public Safety Director Ralph Milstead not tocooperate with a probe of the alleged death threat against formerMecham aide Donna Carlson, who testified before the state grandjury investigating Mecham.   State official Lee Watkins, who has since resigned, has deniedmaking the threat.   Two-thirds of the 30 Senate votes are required to convictMecham, who is the first U.S. governor to be impeached since 1929,when Huey Long of Louisiana and Henry S. Johnston of Oklahoma wereimpeached. Long was never tried, while Johnston was removed.   Of the 16 governors in the nation's history to be impeached, sixwere convicted and removed from office.   Mecham, who never was considered part of the state's Republicanestablishment, won the governorship in a three-way race 1986 on hisfifth try.   He immediately became embroiled in controversy when he canceleda Martin Luther King holiday for state workers, saying it wasillegally declared by his predecessor, Democratic Gov. BruceBabbitt.   Mecham has been criticized for defending the use of the word``pickaninny'' in a book and for making remarks that angered women,Jews, homosexuals and the Japanese.</TEXT></DOC>
