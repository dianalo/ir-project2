The now-defunct bank holding company's bad lendingpractices helped create the costliest bank failure in U.S.history.</LP><TEXT>   People familiar with the probes say the Securities andExchange Commission and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.are looking into whether Arthur Young partners here receivedspecial treatment on real estate loans they received fromRepublicBank in the early 1980s, and whether those loansinfluenced those partners' judgment in signing off on thecompany's public financial statements.   RepublicBank in 1987 merged with InterFirst Corp. to formFirst RepublicBank Corp., which failed a year later, becauseof disastrous real estate and energy loans the two companieshad made in earlier years. Although Arthur Young, now knownas Ernst andamp; Young, didn't audit the books of FirstRepublicBank, regulators are still sifting through thewreckage for ways to defray the estimated $3 billion cost ofthe bailout.   &quot;As a matter of course the FDIC looks into potentialclaims against former professionals who had relationshipswith financial institutions that failed, and that inquiry isongoing with regard to First Republic,&quot; said Mark Rosen, adeputy general counsel of the FDIC. (First RepublicBank isn'trelated to First Republic Bancorp of San Francisco.)   If a case is brought against New York-based Ernst andamp; Young-- which denies any wrongdoing -- it would likely center onreal estate loans made to several Arthur Young partners,mostly located in the Dallas area, during the boom years ofthe early 1980s. The loans, first disclosed by the New YorkTimes, are understood to have helped finance partners'investments in a shopping center near here and an apartmentcomplex in Austin.   Although such loans wouldn't necessarily violate anyregulations as long as the borrowers didn't receive favorabletreatment, such as below-market interest rates, critics saythey nonetheless raise questions about whether the auditorswere truly independent. The FDIC and the SEC have been poringover the books of several failed financial institutions toexamine such questions, and the SEC recently charged the Bankof New England with fraud for improper reporting of thedeterioration of its loan portfolio.   Harvey Pitt, a former SEC general counsel retained latelast year by Ernst andamp; Young to investigate the loans, said heconcluded that the partners &quot;correctly applied existingstandards for independence.&quot; He said the loans were eithersecured or not material, and were &quot;made under normal lendingprocedures.&quot; Mr. Pitt said the Office of the Comptroller ofthe Currency also found no impropriety.   ---   Lee Berton in New York and Kevin G.
