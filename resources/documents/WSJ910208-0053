But despite the French restaurant on the topfloor, the paintings on the walls, and the customized moodmusic in the hallways, this, too, is a factory, at leastaccording to Hitachi Ltd. It churns out computer software.   Hitachi's &quot;information systems&quot; factory and about a dozenlike it around Japan could jar the way software is writtenworld-wide, just as Japanese automobile factoriesrevolutionized manufacturing, according to a small butgrowing number of American academics and business executives.The high quality and productivity of Japan's softwareindustry, they say, show it is time to discard theconventional wisdom that Japan can only make computer boxes,not the ideas that run them.</LP><TEXT>   The Japanese aren't yet battering Microsoft Corp. or LotusDevelopment Corp. So far, the software catching analysts'eyes is invisible to the average consumer. It goes into largesystems that run banking machines, train schedules and hotelreservations, as well as inside photocopy machines andvideocassette recorders. Even so, the differences can haveenormous implications for the productivity of both the U.S.and Japanese economies.   &quot;In every other industry, we've seen the Japanese realizehigh levels of production first, and then develop betterproducts,&quot; said Michael A. Cusumano, a MassachusettsInstitute of Technology associate professor and author of therecently published book &quot;Japan's Software Factories: AChallenge to U.S. Management.&quot; He spoke to a gathering of theTokyo chapter of the American Electronics Associationrecently.   &quot;Toyota had 50% more efficiency {than the U.S.} in 1965,but the cars were terrible,&quot; noted Mr. Cusumano, whoseprevious book analyzed the Japanese auto industry. But Toyotacaught up with Detroit in performance and design, and &quot;thisis what I predict will begin in software.&quot;   Since the mid-1980s, various studies have noted theadvantages of Japan's more structured approach to softwarewriting. But most were poorly researched and largely ignored.Mr. Cusumano claims to have done the most thorough,quantitative analysis of the issue, and his work is turningheads in the U.S.   His conclusions: Japanese companies averaged 50% to 70%higher output per programmer, and one-third to one-half thelevel of errors, out of a sample of 40 large American andJapanese computer systems. Those findings mirror other recentwork. A report circulated last year by an executive at a U.S.technology concern says that International Business MachinesCorp.'s subsidiary in Japan has far fewer defects and muchhigher output per programmer than the corporation's U.S. andEuropean operations.   The main explanation given for such differences is the&quot;factory&quot; strategy used by companies such as Hitachi, FujitsuLtd., NEC Corp., and Toshiba Corp. Fujitsu turned to theapproach when a major industrial customer &quot;told us theychecked our software with the same quality control methodsthey used for their steel,&quot; says Naoyuki Akikusa, one of thecompany's top software managers.   The details vary, but the basic concept of a &quot;softwarefactory&quot; is the same. American companies tend to treatsoftware as an art; the Japanese have tried to make theprocess something done by rote. The Japanese separate theconceptualizing from the actual making of the software, whichconsists of putting the ideas into millions of lines ofcomplex computer code. Hitachi shapes the ideas for itssoftware in a research and development center nine miles fromthe Kawasaki factory.   Hitachi is considered the pioneer, building its firstso-called software factory in 1969 and opening its7,000-employee plant here two years ago. It seems as muchlike a factory as a white-collar office can. The programs arewritten in 60 different work units, identically laid out ineven rows, down to the placement of the computers on eachdesk. Just as Japanese auto companies call line workers&quot;associates&quot; to boost self-esteem, programmers here have theelevated title of &quot;engineers,&quot; although few have advanceddegrees and their jobs involve mainly the mundane task ofcrunching codes.   Contrary to the casual atmosphere of an American softwarehouse, virtually all the female employees wear green uniformswhile the male &quot;engineers&quot; wear white shirts and ties, withthe occasional rebel sporting a sweater instead of a darkjacket. Hitachi did introduce &quot;flex time&quot; a couple years ago,but everyone must still be at their desk every day during the&quot;core time&quot; of 10:50 a.m. to 3:35 p.m. One computer-gameterminal sits at the front of each 100-person work unit, butexecutives say nobody uses them.   Various U.S. industry studies have found that the Japaneseemphasize quality control more than American companies. AnAmerican software developer may come up with a clever trickto solve a problem, but often may fail to keep a log, so itis difficult to dissect or duplicate the work later on.Japanese employees keep detailed records of every keystroke.And Japanese companies, on average, reuse about twice as muchof their basic programming over and over again to save effortand boost quality, according to Mr. Cusumano.   Most of Japan's progress in software comes from theprivate sector. At various times over the past decade, U.S.government and academic officials have screamed about Japan&quot;targeting&quot; America's last major uncontested computer domain.But various high-priced government and industry groupsdesigned to improve Japanese software apparently haven't donemuch. A Japanese business magazine last year dismissed agovernment project designed to help automate software writingwith the headline, &quot;The Failure of the National Project ThatSpent 25 Billion Yen and Five Years.&quot;   Japan doesn't consider itself a software success. Theassembly-line type production and the government programsaren't so much aimed at beating the U.S. as averting a feareddomestic disaster. A tight labor shortage, particularly intrained computer programmers, combined with an explodingdemand for software for everything from washing machines tosupercomputers, has raised the specter of a severe shortage.The government forecasts a shortfall of a million softwareengineers by the year 2000.   And Japan does have a long way to go before it challengesthe U.S. stranglehold on the world software industry, atleast for software sold separately from hardware. To thelayman, &quot;software&quot; means PC packages, and the Japanese areyears from becoming major players in that market. That ispartly because of their domestic industry structure: PC usein Japan is far lower than in the U.S., and Japanese usersprefer customized programs to mass-produced packages. Themost popular PC package in Japan in 1989 was Lotus's 1-2-3spreadsheet.   Analysts also note that although Japan has done well insoftware production, it is only a small part of the process,perhaps less important than the original idea and the way itis applied for the customer. Some Japanese say they aren'tcreative enough to catch up in that area. &quot;We still needthose one or two geniuses,&quot; says Shigenori Matsushita, ageneral manager of Toshiba's information processing group.Some blame the industry structure for stifling that. The bestsoftware in the U.S. tends to come from smaller, independentsoftware houses, while much of the software in Japan iscontrolled by the large computer makers.   But the Japanese are working hard to rectify thosedeficiencies. The major computer makers are setting up smallsoftware companies and sharing their production techniques.They also are tapping American and European software brains.In December, Fujitsu said it would jointly develop financialsoftware with a British company, and this year it hopes toset up a software development lab in Silicon Valley. TheJapanese say the trend toward industrywide standards willhelp them push their software as an independent product;until it now has been tied to their own exclusive operatingsystems.   Says Kumio Matsunaga, Hitachi's information systemsmarketing manager, &quot;Please expect a lot from us in this fieldin the future.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
