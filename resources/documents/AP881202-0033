PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A pathologist acquitted of charges hekilled his cancer-stricken wife to end her suffering says his firstjob is putting his life back together, but he doesn't know wherehe'll begin.   ``I've got a lot of pieces. It's going to take a lot of work,''Dr. Peter Rosier said Thursday after a jury cleared him of allcharges in the Jan. 15, 1986, death of his 43-year-old terminallyill wife, Patricia.   After deliberating a little more than three hours in thefour-week trial, the Pinellas County Surrogate Court panel clearedRosier, 47, of first-degree murder, attempted murder and conspiracy.   As the verdict was read, Rosier wept and relatives in thecourtroom screamed with joy. If convicted, he could have beensentenced to life in prison.   Rosier hugged his children Jacob, 19, and Elizabeth, 21, whosupported him and attended the trial daily.   The physician said his family wants him to resume his medicalpractice, but he's doubtful about that. ``I've dealt with a lot ofcancer and death,'' he said.   Assistant State Attorney Ed Volz said he was disappointed withthe verdict, but felt the prosecution handled the case well. ``Thejury made a decision based upon the facts,'' said Volz. ``I'm neversurprised by what a jury does.''   Defense attorney Stanley Rosenblatt said the case never shouldhave gone to trial. For the state to charge first-degree murder``bordered on insanity,'' Rosenblatt said.   The state maintained that Rosier obtained sedatives for his wifeto commit suicide, then administered morphine when they only lefther comatose. Eventually, he manipulated her stepfather and brothersinto finishing the job, the state argued.   But the defense portrayed Rosier as a loving husband of 22 yearswho wanted to help his wife fulfill her wish of avoiding a painfulend.   ``If anything good has come out of this, it is perhaps thatpeople in the U.S. will start to look at the terminally ill and therights of the terminally ill because of the terrible tragedy thatbefell Patricia Rosier and the rest of our family,'' Rosier said.   Derek Humphry, president of the pro-euthanasia Hemlock Society,hailed the verdict and called for a change in laws to allow apainless death to end suffering.   The acquittal ``sends a signal ... that jurors are not likely toconvict in assisted suicide cases _ otherwise known as euthanasia.It is time to modify the law to permit physicians to help terminalpatients who request help with death,'' he said.   The prosecution charged that Rosier, pained by his wife'sfast-spreading lung cancer, obtained 20 Seconals for her to take andadministered morphine injections and suppositories when the sedativefailed to work.   Her stepfather, Vincent Delman, testified that he went into herbedroom with his two sons, Russell and Farrell, after she lingeredfor 12 hours in a coma, and smothered her.   The Delmans were key prosecution witnesses who testified under agrant of immunity given before the state knew the extent of theirinvolvement.   The charges were brought after Rosier appeared on a TV interviewand talked about administering drug overdoses to his wife.   Volz said Rosier used the broadcast to try to spark interest inan unpublished book about Mrs. Rosier's life and death, which hewanted to parlay into a movie.</TEXT></DOC>
