The service said it will withhold future $25 million payments unless the Los Angeles-based contractor begins meeting the schedule.    Northrop first fell behind in its deliveries about a year ago, the Air Force said. Instead of delivering six guidance systems a month, as called for in a $159 million fiscal 1985 contract, the company has been delivering between two and five.    For the past year the Air Force has been chopping Northrop's monthly payments by $15 million and $17 million from the $25 million specified in the contract. In late February, after the company again failed to deliver the agreed-to amounts, the Air Force said it would withhold the full $25 million.    The Air Force also says Northrop hasn't kept up with routine repairs and maintenance on systems already installed.    The service said much of the blame for the delays lies with subcontractors building components for the guidance systems. &quot;Some of the suppliers have been slow,&quot; said one Air Force official, adding that the full withholding of monthly payments will likely prompt Northrop to crack down on the subcontractors.    The Air Force official said the Northrop systems, although late, have performed well in flight tests. The Northrop equipment is currently installed in 17 MX nuclear-tipped missiles deployed in silos in the Rocky Mountain area.    In Los Angeles, a spokesman for Northrop said the company is having trouble &quot;getting enough parts from our vendors to complete the (MX guidance) units and ship them out.&quot; He said the problem was being eased by mulitiple sourcing for some subcontracted parts.    The spokesman said Northrop is &quot;working on the problem with the Air Force as best we can,&quot; but he wouldn't comment on when the company expected to return to the six-a-month delivery schedule. He also declined to name subcontractors with which it had had problems.    Northrop's revenue from MX work amounted to $328 million last year, or about 6% of its total revenue. The spokesman said any payments withheld by the Air Force would eventually be received by the company when the units are delivered. </TEXT></DOC>
