(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Reagan declared today that``excessive drug politics'' is getting in the way of the battleagainst narcotics trafficking and urged that a congressional andexecutive branch task force be formed to recommend solutions.   Speaking to the graduating class of the U.S. Coast Guard Academyhere, Reagan called drug abuse ``the foremost concern in ourcountry,'' and said there must be a calming of political debate.   ``If America's anti-drug effort gets tripped up in partisanship,if we permit politics to determine policy, it will mean a disasterfor our future and that of our children,'' he said.   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., one of the administration'sharshest critics on drug policy, scoffed at the tone of Reagan'sspeech, saying in advance that the nation ``needs action,'' nottalk.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater on Tuesday had saidReagan was ``very frustrated'' about the progress of efforts tocombat drug abuse.   Reagan said in his speech that he was ``calling on both housesof the Congress, both sides of the aisle, to join with myrepresentatives in a special executive-legislative task force toadvance America's unified response to the problem of illegal druguse.''   He said the task force should find a consensus on ways to blockthe supply of illegal drugs, reduce demand and improve interdictionefforts.   ``Nothing should be overlooked or ruled out,'' he said, asking,``If we cannot remove the politics from drugs, how can we hope toremove the drugs from our communities, workplaces and schools?''   Reagan announced, among other things, that he has directedDefense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci ``to tap the best minds bothinside and outside of government to come up with creative solutionson how we can better use military resources and technologies todetect drugs.''   ``It is time to make illegal drugs `Public Enemy No. 1,' '' hesaid. Reagan in April 1987 had proclaimed AIDS as ``Public EnemyNo. 1'' during a speech to a medical audience in Philadelphia.   Before the speech, Reagan arranged to visit the Coast Guardcutter ``Vigorous'' for a briefing about its drug-interdictionprocedures and then have lunch with crew members before the speechto some 160 members of the 107th graduating class.   Reagan spoke in the wake of harsh criticism of an administrationoffer to drop drug-trafficking indictments against Panamanianstrongman Manuel Antonio Noriega in return for Noriega's agreementto relinquish power.   Reagan refused to confirm or deny the offer Tuesday, tellingreporters that ``I can't comment on negotiations that are underway.''   But the administration's move has infuriated many members ofCongress, and has been injected into the presidential campaign andcongressional debate over whether to increase the role of the U.S.military in drug interdiction efforts.   White House Chief of Staff Howard H. Baker Jr. told reporterstoday that ``by whatever means, we're going to use that (Noriegaindictment) to try to implement administration policy, which is tosee that Noriega leaves power, leaves the country and paves the wayfor democratic rule in that nation.''   In his speech, however, Reagan said, ``Our policy is one of`zero tolerance' for illegal drugs, and we are looking forsolutions, not just a restatement of the problem.''   The speech came amid growing sentiment in Congress for tougherlaws to deal with drug traffickers, including proposals to imposethe death sentence on those who commit murder in the drug trade.   Fitzwater on Tuesday said that ``there is much more to be doneon both the demand and supply side of drug abuse.''   He said Reagan is ``very frustrated, too, with the progressagainst drugs.''   ``I think the president hopes that people will be careful andrealistic in discussions of where we go on the drug effort,'' hesaid. ``Everybody wants to out-drug each other in terms ofpolitical rhetoric. ... ''   D'Amato scoffed at the White House's claim to want politicstaken out of the debate.   ``If we took action, there wouldn't be any necessity forrhetoric,'' he said. ``It's naive for his speechwriters to say,`Drop the political rhetoric,' if they are going to make a dealwith the scoundrel'' in Panama.</TEXT></DOC>
