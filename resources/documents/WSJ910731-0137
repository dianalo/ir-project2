Not that the facts describing Bolivia's growth, or ratherits lack thereof, are misleading; neither can it be deniedthat the country has continued to face difficult hurdles inits economic program, such as the increasing socialdiscontent and vocal opposition to the program, due largelyto its apparent failure in producing a satisfactory rate ofgrowth, higher employment and better standards of living.That is Bolivia's reality today, and it would beself-defeating to deny it.</LP><TEXT>   What is disturbing, however, is to see Bolivia portrayed,at best, as a half-baked case of economic reconstruction.Bolivia did not just &quot;tackle runaway inflation and foreigndebt while maintaining democracy&quot;; it did not just &quot;slash allsubsidies, devalue the currency by 95%, dismantle importtariffs and fire 23,000 state-employed miners&quot;; and it hasnot simply &quot;had four years of positive {economic} growth.&quot;All these &quot;modest&quot; facts have been casually buried in yourstory in a sea of negative innuendo about the country, aboutits efforts to break away from poverty during the past sixyears and about its government and future prospects.   I offer the following:   -- Since 1986, Bolivia has boasted the lowest rate ofinflation in South America. Its foreign debt was not just&quot;tackled&quot; (many countries in Latin America have &quot;tackled&quot;their debt) -- Bolivia cleared 70% of its commercial debt andonly $209 million (U.S.) remains outstanding, and is expectedto be eliminated by year's end.   -- Subsidies were not &quot;slashed,&quot; they were eliminated, andall prices were liberalized to market forces; the only pricestill set by the government, that of gasoline, stands todayabove world levels in Bolivia and is clearly far fromsubsidized.   -- The boliviano is today freely convertible to thedollar. Bank deposits and transactions can be made in dollarsor bolivianos. The spread between the official and the marketrate has remained at less than 1% for the past five years.   -- Foreign-currency reserves, as well as deposits in thebanking system, are at all-time highs. Flight capital isreturning rapidly and interest rates have begun to ease.   -- Tariffs have been dismantled, and all non-tariffbarriers to trade have been abolished. Bolivia's tariffs aretoday the lowest on the continent and comparable, in average,only with those of the U.S.   Jorge Crespo-Velasco   Ambassador of Bolivia   Washington</TEXT></DOC>
