MorningStar, a maker of specialized dairy products, hasbeen trying to restructure about $77 million in bank debt andabout $150 million in subordinated debt. The company wascreated in 1988 to buy Southland Corp.'s dairies afterSouthland went private in a leveraged buy-out. It previouslysaid it might have to seek bankruptcy-law protection if itcouldn't work out a plan to pay its debts.</LP><TEXT>   Under the agreement, Hicks Muse, an investment firm thatspecializes in buy-outs, will borrow $120 million from a bankgroup initially to help repay the current bank debt andpurchase debentures under a tender offer begun last month.Current MorningStar shareholders will own about 5% of thestock after the transaction is completed. In addition, thebank group may receive warrants to buy shares in the future.   MorningStar also said it extended until Feb. 22 its offerto acquire as much as $110 million of its $150 million in 13%senior subordinated debentures, due 2000, outstanding. Underthe offer, which was to have expired Wednesday, MorningStarwill purchase each $1,000 face amount for $525. The companysaid $116 million in debentures had been tendered as ofWednesday.   Hicks Muse, which also is in the process of acquiringHealthco International Inc., said it is negotiating with thebank group, led by Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan and NMBPostbank Groep N.V., for the new financing. The two banks arepart of MorningStar's current bank lender group, but theywill provide a larger part of the new bank loan than they donow.   The investment concern also said that it plans to focusMorningStar's business on specialty foods, such as cottagecheese and yogurt, while continuing its move away from thecommodity dairy business. MorningStar &quot;was a product of the1980s,&quot; Hicks Muse Chairman Thomas O. Hicks said. Because itpurchased a commodity business at the top of the market, hesaid, &quot;it was destined to get into trouble.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
