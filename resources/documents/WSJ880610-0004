The Finance Ministry reported yesterday that the surplus fell 21.3% in May from a year earlier, to $5.05 billion from $6.42 billion. It was the 13th consecutive decline from the year-earlier month and followed a 10.5% fall in April.    Imports gained 26.7%, to $15.45 billion, outpacing export growth of 10.2%, to $20.5 billion.    No part of the world benefited more than the U.S. Japan's surplus with the U.S. declined for the fourth consecutive month, narrowing 25.6% from the year before, to $3.30 billion from $4.45 billion.    U.S. exporters, bolstered by the weak dollar, are finding greater Japanese demand for products ranging from office equipment to soybeans. Japanese imports from the U.S. increased 39.3% in May, to $3.5 billion. On the other hand, Japan's shipments of cars and capital goods to the U.S. are slackening. Overall exports to the U.S. dropped 2.2% in May, to $6.8 billion.    After seasonal adjustment, Japan's global surplus fell 21.2% in May, to $5.02 billion from $6.37 billion in April. Adjusted imports rose 0.3%, to $15.21 billion, while exports dropped 6%, to $20.23 billion.    David Gerstenhaber, senior economist with Morgan Stanley International Ltd., said May's seasonally adjusted surplus was the lowest since February 1986 and represented a 35% decline since January.    Most analysts see little sign of any significant slackening in Japan's import boom, despite the fact that May's import growth of 26.7% from a year earlier slowed slightly from the April rate, when imports increased 31.1% from the previous year.    Richard Jerram, economist with Kleinwort Benson International Inc., said this slight deceleration wasn't surprising, with the Japanese economy showing signs of slowing after three quarters of rapid expansion. But, he added, import growth should continue because domestic demand will remain strong and because of government pressure on Japanese companies to reduce the country's trade surplus.    Economists noted, however, that the total import figures were somewhat inflated in May by stepped-up purchases of oil in advance of the government's imposition of higher tariffs in August. That means that by late summer, Japan's total imports may fall as oil purchases subside.    Manufactured goods accounted for 48.6% of Japan's imports in May, down slightly from 49.9% in April. In this category, general equipment rose 39.3% from a year earlier, to $2.15 billion, with office equipment gaining 40.3%, to $238.4 million.    On the export side of the ledger, dollar-denominated exports continue to grow, particularly electrical equipment, up 15.7% on the year to $4.66 billion, and general equipment, which gained 18.5% to $4.24 billion. But analysts said that in volume terms, exports generally have been flat recently. That was reflected in the yen-denominated figures for exports, which showed a 1.8% year-to-year decline in May and a seasonally adjusted 5.4% fall from April. Yen-denominated imports gained 13% on the year and 3.1% from April.    At the same time, analysts said there are clear signs that exporters pressured by the strong yen have been raising export prices. David Pike, economist with UBS Phillips andamp; Drew International Ltd., said he sees indications that the appreciation of the South Korean won and the New Taiwan dollar in the past year, which has made Korean and Taiwanese exports more expensive as well, is allowing Japanese exporters to raise prices.    Significantly, the 39.3% growth in imports from the U.S. in May, to $3.5 billion, outpaced the increase in imports from Southeast Asia, which rose 34.4%, to $3.9 billion. Developing nations, particularly those in Southeast Asia, generally are considered to have benefited the most from the yen's appreciation, a notion that May's figures belie to a certain extent.    Mr. Gerstenhaber of Morgan Stanley said that after the so-called Plaza Accord of September 1985, monthly Japanese imports of U.S. goods were running at the $2 billion level, a clear sign that the appreciation of the yen since then has had its desired impact on the bilateral trade relationship.    Japanese exports to Southeast Asia grew 17.6%, to $5.18 billion, shrinking Japan's surplus with that area by 14.6%, to $1.29 billion from $1.51 billion. By contrast, Japan's trade surplus with the European Community climbed 19%, to $1.78 billion from $1.49 billion. Exports to the EC jumped 25.9%, to $3.84 billion, offsetting a 32.6% rise in imports, to $2.05 billion. Mr. Pike of UBS Phillips andamp; Drew said the widening imbalance reflects the yen's &quot;very limited exchange-rate adjustment vis-a-vis European currencies,&quot; particularly the mark and currencies that tend to move along with the West German unit. </TEXT></DOC>
