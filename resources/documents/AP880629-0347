No pickup.</NOTE><DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The U.S. dollar edged higher early Thursday againstthe Japanese yen, although it declined from its opening highs,while stock prices rose in active trading in Tokyo.   The dollar opened at 132.90 yen, up from Wednesday's close of132.40 yen, but retreated to the 132.45-132.55 yen level bymidmorning.   The dollar fell because market participants were closing theirpositions prior to the long Fourth of July holiday weekend in theUnited States, said a dealer with a major securities firm, speakingon condition of anonymity.   Financial markets will be closed Monday in the United States.   ``Those who were buying the currency at the 133-yen level at thestart of trading moved down to 132 yen because of the upcomingholiday,'' he said.   The dealer also attributed the dollar's decline to bullishmovement overnight in New York, where the dollar briefly shatteredthe 134-yen level.   ``The market today (Thursday) is taking a break,'' the dealersaid.   But he added that he expected the dollar to bounce back againstthe yen as soon as the U.S. holiday weekend was over, ``so long asthe Bank of Japan does not intervene in the market.''   Lack of intervention by Japan's central bank since last week hasfueled the dollar's surge on the Tokyo foreign exchange market.During a regular press conference earlier this week, FinanceMinister Kiichi Miyazawa ruled out the possibility of interventionand dismissed the current market gyrations as ordinary fluctuations.   However, Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita told a newsconference Wednesday the nation's central bank was ready to take``appropriate'' action to brake the dollar's rise, depending on howthe U.S. currency moves in the future.   The dollar has risen 3.45 yen in the past two trading days inTokyo.   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225selected issues, up 209.24 points on Wednesday, rose another 123.03points to 27,730.36 by the end of the morning trading session.   The main market barometer's climb was led mainly by heavyelectricals, shipping issues and shipbuilders. Traders saidautomakers also managed to move higher during the morning dealings.</TEXT></DOC>
