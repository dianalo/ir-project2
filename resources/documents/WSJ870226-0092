It also was not very exclusive -- going to all of the hundreds who held a foreign press pass here a year ago. Though I don't remember risking my life for the Philippines revolution, if Mrs. Belmonte says I did, I suppose anything is possible.    They have their own way of doing things in the Philippines. A year ago, the Filipinos toppled a tyrant of 20 years' endurance with three days of street demonstrations -- and by disarming his military with gentle talk and box lunches. Yesterday they celebrated the anniversary of that feat in the same singular style.    There was a vast parade with only one float and a band that played &quot;Farmer in the Dell.&quot; President Corazon Aquino led a crowd, thick with boiled-peanut vendors, in prayer. Air-force helicopters rained bougainvillea blooms. And an aging rock 'n' roller commandeered a 10-lane highway and urged everyone to &quot;rock around the clock.&quot;    The revolution had begun, unpromisingly, when President Ferdinand Marcos's chief of staff, Gen. Fidel Ramos, and his defense minister, Juan Ponce Enrile, barricaded themselves inside a military base and pleaded with Manilans to come protect them. The protection was desultory at first. Meanwhile, down the street, Mr. Marcos's marines assembled in battle gear.    Staging all that would make for a rather grim fiesta, though. In the anniversary reenactment, the revolution looked more benign: A swarm of smiling celebrators -- accompanied by a band, a statue of the Infant Jesus and a yellow plywood boat full of singers -- paraded to the military base, where soldiers, also smiling, trotted out to join them.    A year ago, the tide was turned for the rebels when defecting helicopter pilots fired an off-target but demoralizing rocket attack on Mr. Marcos's Malacanang Palace. Errant rocket attacks make grim fiestas too, so this time the helicopters dropped only flowers and confetti, plus tracts from the army's new community-relations bureau.    But the job of retouching history was for the official celebration. The unofficial celebration was more sublime.    Jaime Biton, a retired engineer, parked his Toyota truck in the marchers' path and affixed a sign reading: &quot;This is the first private vehicle to enter Malacanang after the swindler dictator scampered.&quot; Mr. Biton said he was driving around Manila last year when he heard a radio report that Mr. Marcos had fled. &quot;'By golly,' I thought, 'that Satan has left,' and I made the dash over there.&quot;    Likewise, Ramon Jacinto and his band, the Hijacks, took over a major highway during the celebrations and turned it into a giant disco. Mr. Jacinto had missed the revolution: His family was in exile, having been relieved by Mr. Marcos of such holdings as its steel mill. But the family radio station achieved some revolutionary fame anyway. As Radyo Bandido, it interrupted its format of golden-oldies rock to broadcast the rebels' appeals.    Folk singers Peter, Paul and Mary -- fresh from a benefit in El Salvador and on their way to another for South Korean dissidents -- stopped by for the celebration, too. They sang about how &quot;children and nuns kneel{ed} down to pray. Tanks stopped -- a miracle that day.&quot;    A fireworks show, scheduled to begin a year to the minute after Mr. Marcos fled, sparked wide debate about just when Mr. Marcos in fact had fled. U.S. Ambassador Stephen Bosworth, who lent the Marcoses their getaway helicopter, contended it was 9:15 p.m., but the debate proved moot. With the celebrations running ahead of schedule and Mr. Marcos forgotten in his Hawaiian exile, the fireworks went off early.    Mr. Enrile, fired as Mrs. Aquino's defense minister last year after he apparently encouraged plotting against her, declined the post of anniversary-celebration chairman. He showed up in a hotel coffee shop to offer TV cameras his reminiscences, however.    And Gen. Ramos, less coy and still in office, offered his back yard for a Mass and chicken dinner for those who had protectively surrounded his house during the revolution. Pepsi-Cola helped to sponsor the affair, and, in return, hung its logo above the altar.    The revolution apparently was good for commerce, and its anniversary was even better. Street-corner vendors, after saturating the T-shirt market, moved on to &quot;I was a human barricade&quot; sun visors, bedroom slippers and baby clothes.    There were innovators like Robert Narcado, who peddled lengths of barbed wire for 25 cents each. He got the idea a year ago when he joined the mob that pushed its way through the concertina wire surrounding Malacanang and got its first-ever glimpse of the palace.    Because Gen. Ramos and Mr. Enrile used the telephone to rally support during the crisis, the phone company is advertising itself as &quot;a vital link to freedom.&quot;    And Allied Bank, having been confiscated from a crony of Mr. Marcos, is feeling its way back into respectability. It is Allied that named a Roster of Heroes of the Revolution -- including the whole foreign press corps. </TEXT></DOC>
