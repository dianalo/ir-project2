Bush had no immediate reaction to Wednesday's indictment of twoformer White House officials _ Oliver L. North and John M.Poindexter _ on charges stemming from the arms-to-Iran initiative.   But Pete Teeley, his chief spokesman, said, ``They weren'tunexpected.'' And he said that ``what is going on with those fourgentlemen has nothing to do with this campaign.''   Teeley insisted that the specter of indictments of former Reaganadministration figures had nothing to do with Bush's statement lastweek that ``I am tired of being embarrassed'' by accounts ofunethical behavior by high government officials.   That may be so, but a federal grand jury and a specialprosecutor have managed what presidential rival Bob Dole had beenunable to do _ keep the Iran-Contra furor in the public view.   The Kansas senator had hoped to raise sufficient questions aboutBush's role in the Iran-Contra affair to sow doubts in the minds ofRepublicans about Bush's electability against a Democrat inNovember.   In the wake of the indictments of North and Poindexter, alongwith arms merchants Richard Secord and Albert Hakim, Bush may bethinking of Alexander M. Haig Jr.'s tart warning of Jan. 8.   ``If you can't answer your friends, what in heaven's name isgoing to happen next November if you are our standardbearer andthese Democrats get after you on this subject?'' Haig asked Bush.   In fact, Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri, a Democraticpresidential candidate, said Wednesday, ``This will be an importantissue in the campaign, regardless of whether new evidence isrevealed to further implicate the vice president.''   ``George Bush has already pleaded guilty to exercising badjudgment in what turned out to be the biggest American foreignpolicy debacle in decades,'' he said.   To a certain degree, Bush has answered questions about his rolein the affair, although he has declined to spell out whatreservations he had. But he must cope with some lingering questions:   _Does he still consider Lt. Col. North ``a national hero''despite the ``mistakes'' that North made?   _Was it appropriate for him to invite both North and Vice Adm.Poindexter to a Christmas party at his house on the grounds of theNaval Observatory, even after both had been ousted by Reagan?   _Does he still retain confidence in his national security aide,Donald Gregg, a former CIA agent whose name has cropped up invarious reports linking him to North's behind-the-scenes efforts tomanage the Contra war against the Sandinista regime in Nicaragua?   Gregg has been associated with Felix Rodriguez, another onetimeCIA operative, who had been involved in helping to run the secretresupply operation for the Contras.   _How does he resolve the seeming contradiction between hisstatements that he only became fully aware of the arms-for-hostagesnature of the dealings with Iran late in 1986, and statements bychief of staff Craig Fuller indicating that Amiram Nir, an Israelicounter-terrorism expert, had briefed Bush on this aspect of theinitiative in May 1986?   ``I was told what they were doing, not what we were doing,''Bush subsequently said.   _Can he explain failing to recall the strenuous objections thatSecretary of State George Shultz and then-Defense Secretary CasparW. Weinberger raised about the arms sales? Shultz toldcongressional investigators he became ``apoplectic'' when helearned about it.   Bush told reporters in Adel, Iowa, on Jan. 9 that he would bewilling to make public his notes and documents on the Iran-Contraaffair, saying ``it doesn't bother me'' to declassify some papers.   Bush's reservations reportedly involved his concern, as aonetime CIA director, over the possibility the United States wasallowing Israel to play too great a role a super-sensitive covertoperation.   Reagan has corroborated Bush's statement that the vice presidentvoiced reservations about the deal, but neither has said what thosereservations were.   Bush has acknowledged repeatedly that ``mistakes were made'' inthe arms-to-Iran initiative and the subsequent diversion to theNicaraguan rebels of the proceeds from the sales of anti-aircraftand anti-tank missiles. But he also has said that ``I was aware ofthe Iran initiative and I support the president's decision.''   Bush has said he never knew about the diversion of profits, andthe congressional investigative committees produced no evidence tocontradict him on that.   ``I wish it hadn't happened,'' he said on Dec. 19, 1986.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Merrill Hartson, who regularly reports from theWhite House for The Associated Press, is covering the Bush campaign.</TEXT></DOC>
