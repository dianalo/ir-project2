<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-81-0319 </DOCNO><TEXT>For material irradiation tests at JMTR, user's technical requirementsare gradually becoming more rigid, permitting only a small temperaturedeviation from the desired during irradiation of test materials. As specimentemperature control equipment, several conception were proposed and someof them were translated into actual machines with the capsule havingelectrical seath heaters in it. This system is highly reliable unlessthe integrity of the heaters is threatened. However, in a test with theobject of achieving a high exposure of specimen to neutrons, the breakof a heater or deterioration of a heater caused by irradiation lowersthe reliability of the system. To cope with this drawback, as a partof the irradiation technique improvement program, ''Satulated TemperatureCapsule'' has been developing. This type capsule, in which the watersuplied is boiled, bases on the conception of keeping the coolant atthe saturated temperature facilitates the temperature control. Thoughthere are various types of capsules employed at JMTR, the experienceof the capsule into which the coolant is injected lacks. In designing,thermal performances have to fully understood. Therefore, a program wascompiled to evaluate the thermal behavior in the capsule. The presentreport describes the calculation procedure and guides of input and outputfor the program.</TEXT></DOC>
