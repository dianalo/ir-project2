Pinatubo hasbeen relatively minimal so far. But they are less certain ofthe volcano's effect on the two U.S. military bases thatsprawl in its shadow.   The Pentagon said the possibility of future eruptions andthe cost of repairs to Clark Air Base and Subic Bay navalbase may force the U.S. to re-evaluate its presence.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The question of whether we will remain in the Philippinesis something we have to look at in light of this disaster,&quot;Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said.   Mass evacuations from the slopes of Mount Pinatubo andnearby cities and towns and the closure of Clark have createda sense that the Philippines faces a disaster similar inseverity to the July 1990 earthquake that killed more than2,000 people and damaged roads, bridges and buildingsthroughout the main island of Luzon. But estimates byPhilippine officials, foreign economists andinternational-aid experts suggest that the eruption, whichhas killed about 170 people, will have little impact on thecountry's economy.   Vulcanologists say the worst of the eruptions are probablypast, and concern in Manila is turning to the future of theash-coated U.S. bases. The bases have been the subject ofprotracted and acrimonious talks that appeared to be movingtoward agreement when Mt. Pinatubo stirred last week after a600-year sleep.   U.S. Embassy spokesman Stanley Schrager said the U.S. isassessing damage at Clark and Subic Bay, and &quot;until we havethat assessment, it's too early to speculate on the future ofthe bases or the future of the negotiations.&quot; He added that&quot;no formal policy review&quot; is under way, and that &quot;the talkshave not been suspended or put on hold in that sense.&quot;   Officials in the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs,which has overseen the base negotiations, expressed concernthat the U.S. would use the reduced utility of the bases as abargaining chip to press for a cut in compensation paymentsto Manila or to obtain an extended lease. The U.S. Embassysaid the U.S. would not exploit the situation.   The lease on both bases expires Sept. 16, and Washingtonhas offered to pay $360 million a year in bases-linkedcompensation, mostly military aid, for an extension of 10 to12 years. Manila has been demanding $825 million a year inexchange for a seven-year extension.   The 4,500 U.S. Air Force personnel and 23,000 dependentsand civilians who are being withdrawn from the two baseswould hurt the local economy nearby. But economists believethe eruption won't further cloud the country's already grimoverall economic prospects, though tourism is likely tosuffer. A World Bank economist said its projections forgrowth in gross national product of 1.5% to 2% this year and3.5% in 1992 would remain unchanged.   While some observers express concern that the eruptioncould deter foreign investors, businessmen in Manila aregenerally unfazed. &quot;The Philippines has come through farworse than Mount Pinatubo,&quot; said Thomas J. Leber, presidentof the American Chamber of Commerce in the Philippines.</TEXT></DOC>
