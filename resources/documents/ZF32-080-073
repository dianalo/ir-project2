Young, HPpresident and chief executive officer.andP;  &quot;Orders were satisfactory, given thetough economic climate, and we continued to make progress in managingoperating expenses.andP;  But growth was slower in some of our businesses, and wehad hoped to achieve better operating profits.&quot;andM;Orders for the third quarter totaled $3.5 billion, compared to $3.3 billionreported in the year-ago period.andP;  U.S.andP;  orders grew 4 percent to $1.5billion, while orders from outside the United States grew 11 percent to $2.0billion.andM;&quot;Our new products showed real strength,&quot; Young said.andP;  &quot;Orders for Series 700workstations continue to exceed our forecasts, and the multiuser systems weintroduced in June have been well received in the marketplace.andP;  TheseRISC-based workstations and systems are setting the price/performancestandard for the industry.andP;  Orders for the palmtop PC also are strong.andM;&quot;Test and measurement achieved modest growth, with telecommunications testinga bright spot,&quot; Young added.andP;  &quot;Our peripherals and PC businesses wereaffected by weakness in the U.S.andP;  dealer channel, where we're seeing theeffects of soft demand and dealer consolidations.andP;  Peripherals orders outsidethe United States remain healthy.&quot;andM;Operating expenses increased 4 percent in the third quarter and totaled 37.2percent of net revenue, compared with 38.8 percent of net revenue during theyear-ago quarter.andP;  Employment declined during the quarter, with continuedgood progress in the operating-expense and other overhead categories.andM;&quot;Our recently announced Voluntary Severance Incentive and Enhanced EarlyRetirement programs, which will take effect in the fourth quarter, positionus well for 1992,&quot; Young said.andP;  &quot;There will be some costs associated withthese programs next quarter, but they'll help us reduce the growth ofoperating expenses and help counteract the upward pressures on our cost ofgoods sold as we go forward.&quot;andM;HP's cost of goods sold expressed as a percentage of net revenue was 54.2percent for the quarter, compared with 52.7 percent for the like quarter in1990 and 53.6 percent for the second quarter of 1991.andP;  Several factorscontributed to this increase:  competitive pricing pressures, the productionramp-up of new products, start-up of HP's wafer-fabrication facility inCorvallis, Ore., and heavy shipments of higher-discount products during thequarter.andM;NINE-MONTH REVIEW For the nine months ended July 31, net revenue was $10.7billion, up 10 percent from the $9.7 billion reported for the first threequarters of fiscal 1990.andP;
