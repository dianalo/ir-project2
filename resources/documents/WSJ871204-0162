However, points of your larger analysis invite argument.    It is true, as you said, that rural lenders are flush with cash. This reflects, in part, the strengthening of the farm economy. By the end of 1988, the U.S. Department of Agriculture projects, farm debt will have dropped 30% from its 1982 peak to about $140 billion. This represents an enormous cost savings to farmers, a positive development which has allowed them to operate more efficiently.    You note that an Iowa farmer is considering buying annuities. I would argue that this is a well-advised investment strategy for a self-employed businessman, not a sign of pessimism.    You also note that a Wisconsin farmer has taken some of the profit from his hog enterprise to invest in a community business and a nursing home. I congratulate Mr. Lins on his far-sightedness. He is typical of many pork producers who have avoided the trap of over-expansion just as hog prices appear headed down.    I find little evidence of the widespread pessimism you say abounds on the nation's farms. In fact, the farm crisis, now easing, has taught our food and fiber growers to be tougher businessmen, more cost-conscious and better planners. Many already anticipate a decrease in federal farm subsidies and are fine-tuning their operations to be profitable without them. They should be commended for these efforts. Federal policy makers wrestling with budget deficits have much to learn from them.    Claudia Waterloo   Editor in Chief   Farm Futures Magazine   Milwaukee, Wis.</TEXT></DOC>
