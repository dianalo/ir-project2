The Nuestra Senora de Atocha and its sister ship, the SantaMargarita, went down off the Florida Keys in a 1622 hurricane,taking to the bottom booty collected from Spain's New Worldcolonies. Treasure hunter Mel Fisher and his team of divers locatedand salvaged the wrecks of the two ships.   Besides silver coins and bullion bars weighing up to 90 pounds,Wednesday's auction at Christie's also featured a silver-giltrosewater dish that failed to sell during the main session Tuesdaynight.   The Spanish Ministry of Culture claimed the dish, which portraysa Spaniard carrying a spear and blowing a hunting horn, for $49,500.   Wednesday's session drew about 100 numismatic buffs and othercuriosity seekers, compared to 450 people Tuesday night.   A 78-pound, 10-ounce silver bar from the Atocha, which yieldedthe richest treasure haul ever found, sold for $14,300. Anextremely rare Philip IV coin from the mint of Santa Fe de Bogotawent within its presale estimate at $2,800. The last and smallestsilver bar _ a 1 pound, 4 ounce specimen estimated at $400 to $600_ shot up to $3,300.   Other silver bars hovered mostly in the $8,000 to $10,000 range.   ``They're something you'd want for a souvenir _ but who wouldwant a lot of them?'' said Anthony M. Phillips, head of the silverdepartment at Christie's.   Phillips said the bars would ``melt for about half'' of theirauction price.   The showy, big-ticket items went Tuesday night, when the crowdof onlookers included Texas oil tycoon Nelson Bunker Hunt andactress Margot Kidder. Neither made a purchase.   The Portuguese Navy Museum purchased two brass, mariner'sastrolabes used by the pilots of the ill-fated vessels. They wentfor $132,000 and $83,000 Tuesday night.   Phillips also said that a ``very rich, American private(collector)'' had submitted the $319,000 bid Tuesday for a62-inch-long Renaissance gold chain recovered from the Margarita.</TEXT></DOC>
