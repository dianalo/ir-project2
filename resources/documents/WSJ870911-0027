But higher rates are also ahead for homeowners with the adjustable loans and for those with increasingly popular home-equity loans.    In the past two weeks, 30-year fixed-rate mortgages have jumped an average one-half percentage point nationally, to nearly 11%, lenders estimate. Rates are nearly two percentage points higher than they were last spring, and some economists and lenders predict they will jump a further half to full percentage point by the end of the year.    Spurting mortgage rates follow last Friday's decision by the Federal Reserve Board to raise the discount rate, the bellwether rate at which it makes loans to member banks, and major banks' subsequent decision to raise their prime rates, at which they lend to their best business customers. For now, the mortgage increases have spared consumers with adjustable-rate loans, but economists and others believe they will be inevitably affected, too.    Higher rates are also curbing home sales and new construction nationwide. The National Association of Realtors estimates that existing-home sales this year will approximate the 3,565,000 units sold last year, but the group expected a 2% increase before rates started rising last spring. New home sales, currently running about 10% below first-quarter levels, could fall 8% more before year-end, estimates the National Association of Home Builders. The group expects single-family home building to take a similar plunge.    &quot;It is inevitable that a run-up like this is going to take some toll,&quot; says David Seiders, the home builders' chief economist.    For the week ended last Friday, 30-year fixed rates rose to 10.66% from 10.40% a week earlier, according to HSH Associates, a Riverdale, N.J., mortgage rate monitor. That compares with an average 9.12% rate in March. Yesterday, rates required by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. indicated a 30-year mortgage rate of 11% for home buyers. Such a two-point jump on a $100,000 loan costs a home buyer $150 a month.    HSH Associates expects its national average to reach 10.85% this week, and climb to 11.5% by year end. Rates are swinging so wildly, according to Barry Havemann, the firm's president, &quot;One Texas lender told us, 'We haven't written two mortgages at the same rate today.'&quot;    Many lenders are writing fewer mortgages altogether, showing how consumers are being pressured out of the market. Portland, Ore.-based U.S. Bancorp Mortgage Co., for instance, says its mortgage volume is currently 20% to 25% below 1986 levels, and applications for new loans have declined 30% to 40%. &quot;We see the pipeline continuing to shrink,&quot; says Keith Miles, president of the U.S. Bancorp unit, a major West Coast mortgage lender.    &quot;Clearly, each time rates go up, another section of the potential market is lost,&quot; according to Mr. Miles, who says business is off also because fewer consumers are choosing to refinance existing loans while rates are rising. The company's 30-year fixed rate is currently 10.5%, or one-half percentage point more than two weeks ago. Even with the increase, he says, &quot;I don't know if we will be able to hold that much longer.&quot;    The most recent sharp jump is the second this year. In March and April, turmoil in the bond markets sent rates for home buyers to about 10.5% from 8.75% weeks earlier. Rates eventually settled back to about 10%.    For now, rising rates are also giving added appeal to mortgages with flexible rates, which are pegged to lending costs that haven't risen as much as those backing fixed mortgages. Indeed, several major adjustable-rate lenders, including San Francisco-based First Nationwide Bank and Los Angeles-based Home Savings of America, say business is still brisk. Last week, First Nationwide made $127 million in adjustable-rate mortgages, or more than double the volume when the summer began. Home Savings says the uptick in rates has widened the disparity between conventional fixed rates and its flexible ones. &quot;It has been a shot in the arm,&quot; says Richard Deihl, Home Savings' chief executive.    But some lenders are starting to raise their initial teaser rates, reflecting higher deposit costs, which means consumers with existing adjustable-rate mortgages may also shortly see increases in their monthly payments. Most adjustable-rate loans are tied to U.S. Treasury bills, which are also edging higher and prompting rate increases. Wednesday, for instance, First Nationwide, raised its lowest available adjustable rate to 7.375% from 7.125%.    Dennis Jacobe, director of research for the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, says rising rates may increase thrifts' money costs by one half to three quarters of a percentage point within six months, resulting in similar hikes on existing adjustable-rate mortgages.    Suddenly higher rates also portend trouble for the bulging market for home-equity loans, which appears to be wider and faster-growing than previously believed. Such loans are often pegged to banks' prime rate, which has risen along with mortgage rates. Home-equity loans by banks jumped 75% last year to $35 billion, according to the American Bankers Association, with Sandamp;Ls showing roughly comparable growth.    The ABA says the number of banks offering such loans jumped dramatically, largely because of powerful incentives created by tax changes last year. For every point increase in the prime, the yearly cost to home-equity borrowers would equal roughly $600 million to $700 million, based on aggregate home equity outstanding of $60 billion to $70 billion.    While the spring rise in mortgage rates was due to bond-market turmoil, the latest surge is strongly related to Federal Reserve concerns over the sagging strength of the dollar. The Fed moved to increase interest rates as a way to maintain foreign interest in U.S. debt.    &quot;It's fascinating how our customers -- and we deal only with American individuals and families -- have become so affected by overseas decisions,&quot; says Anthony Frank, First Nationwide's chairman. &quot;That's never happened before.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
