Since 1986, Norway hasvoluntarily held its expanding production below capacity insympathy with OPEC's similar efforts to bolster prices bylimiting output. Currently, Norway pumps 5% less oil than itcould.</LP><TEXT>   Rescinding the so-called holdback would mean little to thevolume of oil reaching world markets, adding only about80,000 barrels a day to the nearly 1.7 million a day Norwaypumps. But the country's posture plays a psychological rolein jittery oil markets. Norway was among the first -- and nowis the last -- non-OPEC producer to curb output in a goodwillgesture to OPEC.   &quot;We are very pragmatic about it,&quot; said Mr. Reiten. He saidcurrent oil market conditions suggest Norway no longer needsto hold down production. While petroleum markets recentlyhave softened because of high OPEC production, prices stillare nearly double the lows reached during 1986 when Norwayvolunteered to cooperate in production-cutting.   In fact, Mr. Reiten, named oil minister only a few monthsago, has already been changing Norway's policies; in January,he reduced the holdback to the current level from 7.5%.   Mr. Reiten cited other reasons for putting the entirepolicy under review. He noted that most OPEC members exceptSaudi Arabia are currently exceeding that organization'sproduction quotas, and that &quot;we seem to be the only countryoutside OPEC doing anything at all.&quot; He said Norway mightconsider production coordination again &quot;if the situationchanges.&quot;   Meantime, the country is actively expanding capacity --largely by developing smaller fields. Mr. Reiten disclosedthat he will present applications in two months to Norway'sparliament to begin development of two such new fields.   Also, Norway will take bids for exploration licenses on 52offshore tracts in September, the country's 13th suchlicensing round and one of its largest ever. The tracts aredivided about equally between the Norwegian sectors of theNorth Sea and the Barents Sea. Although Mr. Reiten said oilcompanies are &quot;queuing up&quot; for the bidding, the Barents Seahas proved disappointing for Norway so far. &quot;The North Sea ismuch more promising than expected,&quot; he said.   He estimated current spending for exploration anddevelopment of North Sea fields at a record 30 billion to 35billion Norwegian kroner ($4.62 billion to $5.4 billion)annually.   Although North Sea oil workers have threatened to strikeJuly 1 and close production temporarily, Norway's totaloutput is expected to continue rising, at least for a fewmore years. &quot;We will see a peaking of production at twomillion barrels a day around 1995,&quot; Mr. Reiten said. &quot;Weexpect it to continue that level for another five or sixyears&quot; and then start to drop, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
