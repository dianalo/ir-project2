(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo said Friday hewants no part of any brokered Democratic National Convention,either as the presidential candidate or a kingmaker in selection ofthe party's nominee.   He said he still didn't believe there will be a deadlockedconvention when the Democrats gather in Atlanta in July.   Cuomo, who announced a year ago that he wouldn't seek theDemocratic nomination, has since refused to rule out accepting aconvention draft.   His comments came as he prepared for trips during the next fewdays to North Carolina and Texas, two of the March 8 Super Tuesdayprimary states.   ``I would have no role,'' said Cuomo of any brokered convention.``They (the announced candidates) would confine themselves topeople who were candidates and talk to one another.''   Cuomo did say the possibility of a brokered convention came upin telephone conversations he had this week with, among others,former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt and Illinois Sen. Paul Simon.Babbitt has quit the race for the presidential nomination whileSimon has cut back on his campaigning to concentrate on his homestate's March 15 primary.   ``I just asked them how they thought it would come out,'' saidCuomo. ``They said it looks now like it's open.''   Cuomo said that in discussing the situation, neither Simon norBabbitt had asked if Cuomo might become a candidate at a brokeredconvention. ``They know I'm not interested. They know I'm out ofthis thing,'' said Cuomo.   Cuomo repeated his view that a deadlocked convention ``is theworst thing that could happen to the Democrats'' because it wouldhurt them in the November election.   Was it coincidence that Cuomo was heading south just before theSuper Tuesday voting? ``Oh, no, that's a plan,'' he joked. ``Yousee, I'm going to be March 1 in Texas and if it really goes well,then March 2 I'm going to announce I'm running.''</TEXT><HEAD>Homeless Rally To Draw Presidential Candidates</HEAD><DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Organizers said a march and rally Saturday forthe homeless, designed to make their plight an issue in thepresidential campaign, is expected to draw Democratic candidatesalong with up to 10,000 participants.
