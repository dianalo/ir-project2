Many Americans are titillated by such scandals, especially when conspicuous clergy or politicians running for president are involved. This preoccupation with sins of the flesh obscures the much more significant sins of the spirit. Believers and voters should distinguish between trivial and significant flaws.    The central sin of The Revs. Swaggart and Jim Bakker is their arrogance and inordinate pride. Pride was the sin for which Lucifer was cast out of Paradise.    TV evangelists have strong egos that feed on the adulation of their unseen followers. The miracle of TV permits the followers to see their leader, but does not permit the leader to see his followers. TV exacerbates certain human vices, especially the drive to manipulate others for one's own purpose.    The Swaggarts or the Bakkers, in tear-jerking &quot;sermons,&quot; exploit the lonely, the poor and the emotionally distressed, by promising them comfort or security for their &quot;gifts.&quot; With tangible contributions from millions of people, each man has built an empire of influence, privilege and indulgence.    Some TV evangelists are more responsible, but the temptation to exploit is great. Demagogic preachers are much like demagogic politicians. In one way or another, each promises inner peace, a chicken in every pot, paradise on earth or salvation in the next world. The TV preachers who claim to have a hot line to God trivialize true religion by attempting to manipulate God into serving their objectives, rather than their serving his.    The media would perform an important service if they distinguished between the glitz and exploitation of a Jimmy Swaggart and the true mission of our Judeo-Christian heritage -- to help us to know and understand the limits and possibilities of history and what can and cannot be done in our personal lives and in the public arena.    Fortunately, there are many American Christian and Jewish leaders who have this deeper understanding of true religion. We can be grateful that our Founding Fathers were numbered among them.
