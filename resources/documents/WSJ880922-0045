Why? Tougher water-quality standards will benefit companies that make water-treatment equipment; consumer concern means big bucks from water filters, purifiers and monitors. Corporations are starting to take notice, says Neil Berlant of Water Research Associates, Los Angeles. &quot;A number of joint ventures and strategic alliances are starting to be formed,&quot; he says, predicting acquisitions will follow.    Water rights, once largely of concern only in the West, are also finding broader appeal. Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. this summer announced formation of a master limited partnership to trade water rights. &quot;A handful of water-rights managers who know Western water are investing in rights on behalf of groups&quot; who want to buy agricultural water and sell it to cities, says Steven Shupe, a Santa Fe, N.M., consultant.    In Denver, the Water Exchange Information Service offers a multiple-listing service for water rights.    VIDEO STORES gear up for &quot;E.T.,&quot; as sales gain strength over rentals.    &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial,&quot; planned for release Oct. 27, is already setting records, with MCA Inc. reporting advance orders for 10.7 million copies. That's more than double the previous record of some 4.3 million for &quot;Cinderella,&quot; to be released Oct. 4. One reason for the huge numbers: Priced at a low $24.95 and $26.99 respectively, both tapes are aimed at buyers, not renters. This will be &quot;the biggest season yet&quot; for tape sales, says Seth Goldstein of Twice, a consumer-electronics trade publication.    The trend toward buying tapes has been gaining strength since 1984, when &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; was priced at $39.95, says Tom Adams of Paul Kagan Associates. &quot;Each time the price has come down another notch, there has been another record.&quot; At Sound Warehouse, Atlanta, &quot;E.T.&quot; is expected to boost video sales 50% to 70%, says manager Nancy Goldwin. Mass marketers are expected to use &quot;E.T.&quot; as a loss leader; prices have already been cut as low as $16.95. Orders show that retailers expect one in five homes with videocassette recorders will buy &quot;E.T.,&quot; Mr. Adams says.    DRIVERS' EDUCATION, reduced by budget cuts, draws state attention.    Just 15 school districts in Allegheny County, Pa., offer a full driver-education program; all 43 had the course 10 years ago. The AAA New Jersey Automobile Club says as many as 60% of high schools in the state have cut back their programs. Surveys show that within three years of the loss of a school driver-training program, &quot;the accident rate climbs for drivers under 25,&quot; says James Lavrinc of the Pennsylvania Association of Professional Driving Schools.    But several states have begun tightening training requirements. Oklahoma just reinstated funding for driver's ed, says Frank Kenel of the American Automobile Association. Virginia is requiring better training for instructors. In New Jersey, a group including the state's motor vehicles division plans this fall to call for a uniform training program for all first-time license applicants.    In Pennsylvania last year, legislators decided they couldn't require driver education without helping to pay for it.    ALL ABOARD: Closed to train passengers since 1975 and closed completely since 1981, Union Station in Washington, D.C., reopens next week after a $150 million refurbishing. The price tag includes the cost of an aborted visitors' center.    REAL-ESTATE PURCHASES made with drug money and other illicit funds are a growing problem, says a survey by Real Estate Insider newsletter. But the size of the problem varied by region. In the West, some 90% of real-estate brokers surveyed said such purchases were a problem in their states, compared with 23% in the Midwest.    ENDOWED TREES: A special endowment was established in 1987 at the College of Wooster for the care of trees. With 1,500 trees on the Ohio campus, that makes the endowment per tree a healthy $204.89. The funds allowed the college to fortify the trees for the summer's drought.    SHOPPING-MALL BUILDERS say retail uncertainty makes business tougher.    A spate of department-store acquisitions by developers and others is creating confusion among builders. Combined with the restructuring of discount stores and supermarket chains, it is making shopping-center development &quot;more difficult and less profitable,&quot; says Jerry O'Connor of J.W. O'Connor andamp; Co., New York. Retailing is in such flux that &quot;we are finding that the players are changing almost daily,&quot; says developer David Hocker, Owensboro, Ky., now starting two regional malls in the Southeast.    Another factor: Increased debt created by store acquisitions comes at a time when retail sales are flat. A jump in interest rates or a slowdown in consumer spending could mean yet another major change in players, some say. If developers need quick cash, Christmas markdowns could start early, says Don Pendley of International Council of Shopping Centers.    Some 1,846 new shopping centers were started last year, but only about 1% were large regional malls.    BRIEFS: Baby boomers use 16% more electricity than people in other age groups, says Consumers Power Co., Jackson, Mich. . . . Leader Federal, Memphis, Tenn., offers what it calls the first &quot;personality&quot; credit card; it features Elvis Presley. </TEXT></DOC>
