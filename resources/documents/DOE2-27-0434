Such a data systemwould provide immediate entry, storage, update and access to a centrallylocated data bank of information relating to building energy conservation,and the results of the review and assessment efforts of all contributors.In the future this system would also have the capability to be convertedto a publically accessible data bank. A feasibility study concluded thatthe program would best be served by the creation and maintenance of anannotated bibliography using the data base facilities of QL Systems.Recommendation was also made that this data base be a private one duringthe life of this program where upon it should be moved to the CAN/OLEsystem at the Canadian Institute for Scientific and Technological Information(CISTI) for public release.</TEXT></DOC>
