The newspaper, Granma, said in an editorial Monday that theUnited States wants Fidel Castro's communist government to changebefore there is talk of cooperation.   ``Washington cannot pretend that Cuba stop being what it is as acondition for any progress in their relations, even to agree onmechanisms for cooperation in the anti-drug struggle,'' Granma said.   The editorial, headlined ``Cuba must be treated as it is: asocialist and sovereign country,'' was carried in full by the Cubangovernment news agency Prensa Latina and monitored in Mexico City.   As long as there isn't a U.S. government ``with common sense andpolitical courage to understand that it cannot aspire to change us,there will not be bilateral progress,'' the editorial said.   During the trials in recent weeks of 14 military officersaccused of shipping Colombian cocaine and other drugs through Cubato the United States, Cuban officials and Granma articles accusedthe U.S. government of failing to share intelligence it had on drugtrafficking.   ``What is certain is that by denying that cooperation oninformation, six tons of cocaine entered U.S. territory, theequivalent of 4 million doses, although this represents less than 1percent of annual consumption in the United States,'' the editorialsaid.   But it said Cuba set an example in its prosecution of theofficers, four of whom were executed by firing squad in July.   ``The reality is that no country in this hemisphere has foughtas energetically against drugs as ours,'' it said. ``For many yearsCuba has fought by itself against the traffickers marauding itscoasts.''   The editorial compared Cuba's punishment of the 14 officers withthe ``scandalously benign sentence imposed on Oliver North.''   North, a National Security Council aide during the Reaganadministration, was fined $150,000 and sentenced to two years'probation and 1,200 hours of community service for his role in thethe Iran-Contra affair. He was convicted of accepting an illegalgift, abetting in the obstruction of Congress and shreddingofficial documents.   ``We have lived 30 years without relations with the UnitedStates,'' the editorial said. If there's anyone who isn't desperateto normalize relations, it's Cuba.''   Castro came to power after the rightist government of FulgencioBatista was overthrown in 1959.</TEXT></DOC>
