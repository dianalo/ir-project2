Israel's ambassador to France, mayors of nearby cities, Cabinetministers and political party leaders made their way to thecemetery to inspect the damage and pay their respects to the dead.   ``The dead will judge us,'' said Elie Weisel, winner of theNobel Peace Prize for his writings about the Holocaust.   Located in southern France, about 350 miles south of Paris,Carpentras has been a haven for Jews since the 13th century, whenthey enjoyed protection under papal rule and were free to worshipas they chose.   Recent archaeological discoveries have revealed the presence ofJews in the region hundreds of years earlier.   In 1967, scientists working on a site near Cavaillon unearthedan oil lamp decorated with a seven-branch candelabra. According toFrench historian Rene Moulinas, the lamp is the oldest vestige ofJudaism in France, dating ``probably to the end of the year 1 B.C.''   The 15th century synagogue is now a classified historicalmonument, known for its spire, ritual baths and an oven dating fromthe Middle Ages and used to bake the unleavened bread eaten by Jewsat Passover.   After the French Revolution when Jews received citizenship, theymoved away from the area and settled in other parts of France.   Today, the synagogue is hardly used for religious worship _Carpentras' Jewish community is too small to have its own rabbi.The town's 26,000 inhabitants include about 100 Jewish families,many of them immigrants from North Africa.   The mayor, Jean-Claude Andrieu, described Carpentras as atranquil town in which the Jews lived harmoniously. The vandalsmust have been outsiders, several residents said.   Families of the dead held an impromptu religious service at thecemetery, and Jewish demonstrators gathered at the gate under thebanner: ``We Will Not Let History Repeat Itself.''   ``This wasn't a crime against the Jews. This was a crime againstall humanity,'' said Dr. Freddy Haddad, leader of the local Jewishcommunity.</TEXT></DOC>
