Salwen   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>07/19/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE C14</SO><IN>SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR)</IN><GV>CONGRESS (CNG)SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC)</GV><LP>   WASHINGTON -- The Senate passed legislation giving theSecurities and Exchange Commission far broader enforcementpowers, including expanding the agency's fining authoritybeyond insider trading for the first time.   The bill, approved on a voice vote, also would allow theagency to police corporate America more actively. That areahad been somewhat de-emphasized in recent years as the SECfocused on Wall Street insider-trading cases. One provisionwould grant the SEC authority to ask a federal court to baran officer or director from serving at a public company ifthat person violates securities law and &quot;demonstratessubstantial unfitness to serve.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Moreover, the legislation would grant the SEC&quot;cease-and-desist authority&quot; to block allegedly fraudulentinvestment activity from continuing.   Sen. Christopher Dodd (D., Conn.), chairman of thesecurities subcommittee, said the bill &quot;sends a strongmessage to would-be law violators that they will be detectedand prosecuted with remedies that fit the crime.&quot;   Some securities lawyers, however, worry that the agency isbeing granted more power than it needs to police the marketsadequately. For example, Theodore Levine, a Washingtonsecurities lawyer, expressed concern in a letter to clientsthat &quot;neither the House nor the Senate have addressed thefact that the SEC has produced absolutely no evidence&quot; thatit needs cease-and-desist authority to supplement traditionalcourt action.   The bill was first proposed by the SEC in 1988 to fillwhat it perceived as holes in its enforcement program. Forexample, SEC officials had complained that they can eitherslap the wrists of offenders by simply requiring them topromise not to repeat an illegal act, or they can bar themfrom the business. That didn't leave much ability to punishmedium-sized violations such as failure to file disclosures,the agency argued.   The bill would allow the agency to fine securities-lawviolators on a tiered system, with maximums of $500,000 forcorporations and $100,000 for individuals.   The measure is awaiting floor approval in the House.Energy and Commerce Committee staff members expect the billto pass easily in a vote scheduled for Monday. The House billgenerally matches the Senate legislation, although it doesn'thave tiers for fines, and it has tighter procedural rules forthe cease-and-desist authority.</TEXT></DOC>
