Bacon   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>03/06/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A10</SO><IN>BANKS (BNK)</IN><GV>TREASURY DEPARTMENT (TRE)CONGRESS (CNG)FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD (FED)FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (FDL)</GV><LP>   WASHINGTON -- The Treasury's blueprint for modernizingbank regulation fails to make a case for allowing commercialfirms to acquire banks, the Congressional Budget Office said.   CBO Director Robert Reischauer, in testimony before theSenate Banking Committee yesterday, said that &quot;no convincingarguments have been advanced to indicate that there are majoradvantages to be achieved by ownership that combines bankingand nonfinancial activities.&quot; His statement, unusually bluntfor the CBO, which generally doesn't take a position onissues, is likely to bolster congressional opposition to theTreasury's plan to combine banking and commerce.</LP><TEXT>   In its banking reform proposal released last month, theTreasury argued that commercial companies would pump capitalinto bank subsidiaries. But Mr. Reischauer said that &quot;theinadequate rates of return banks earn on existing capital&quot;suggests that more capital isn't needed.   Mr. Reischauer, however, said he supported a centralelement of the Treasury's plan -- changing the depositinsurance system to impose more market discipline on banks.But he contended that the proposal doesn't adequately limitthe policy under which the government guarantees alldeposits, even those beyond the scope of deposit insurance,in large banks deemed too big to fail.   Industry and congressional leaders have criticized theTreasury for not doing more to restrict the &quot;too big to fail&quot;doctrine. Yesterday, Senate Banking Committee Chairman DonaldRiegle (D., Mich.) introduced a bill that would prevent theFederal Deposit Insurance Corp. from treating banks as toobig to fail after 1994. However, the Federal Reserve would beable to cover all depositors if it decided that letting thebank fail would destabilize the financial system. The Rieglebill would also limit the scope of deposit insurance andtoughen bank regulation.   Mr. Reischauer also testified that the Treasury had failedto make a convincing case for its proposal to overhaul bankregulation by creating a Federal Banking Agency that wouldsupervise all national banks and thrifts, while placing allstate-charted banks under the Federal Reserve Board. The planwould deny the Fed &quot;authority over all of the institutionsmost likely to create systemic problems -- that is, the 50 orso largest banks,&quot; the CBO chief said.   Reserve Board member John LaWare has said that the Fedshares the concern that it won't have authority over thebanks that play the greatest role in monetary policy,international financial relations, and domestic economicstability. In addition, FDIC Chairman William Seidman hascomplained that the Treasury proposal wouldn't give hisagency the power it needs to protect the Bank Insurance Fund.</TEXT></DOC>
