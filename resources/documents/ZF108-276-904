 What is a MAN?andM;John Leffer Pittsburgh, PennsylvaniaandM;&quot;What is a MAN?&quot;andP;  No, this isn't the opening line of a soliloquy.andP;  Theacronym MAN stands for metropolitan area network.andP;  The working definitions ofLAN, MAN, and WAN often depend on the installation's configuration, but thereare a couple of good rules of thumb for sorting them out.andM;Metropolitan area networks make up a legitimate subcategory of networks.andP;  TheInstitute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) describes standardsfor the operation of networks.andP;  They have a special committee, the IEEE 802.6Working Group, that develops MAN standards.andP;  Other IEEE committees in the 802series developed standards for LANs, while international standards oftenguide wide area network (WAN) design.andP;  So MANs, WANs, and LANs are allseparate entities, according to the IEEE.andM;A local area network typically is a privately owned internal communicationssystem designed to link nodes within a building or group of buildings.andP;  LANsspan a distance of less than 2 miles and don't cross property boundaries.andO;The &quot;privately owned&quot; criteria and distance limitations are important.andP;  Theymake it clear that LANs aren't subject to tariff regulation by state orfederal authorities.andM;Technically, LANs operate at speeds between 2 and 16 megabits per second andallow users to share files, printers, and other resources as if each resourcewere on the desktop.andM;Metropolitan area networks can take many forms, but the term is oftenassociated with a backbone network of fiber-optic cables such as the onestrung by private enterprises in the old coal delivery tunnels under Chicago.andO;A MAN could span a hundred miles.andP;  Local exchange carriers (the localtelephone companies) provide a great deal of the MAN connectivity, as do agrowing number of cable television companies.andP;  While some organizationsinstall their own microwave systems for MAN circuits, the majority leasecircuits from local carriers.andP;  State utility commissions may regulate thetariffs for MAN services.andM;MAN carriers usually offer services in 1.544-megabit-per-second incrementsand their backbone services provide throughput in the range of 80 megabitsper second.andP;  Even a single 1.544-megabit-per-second channel can provideLAN-like response times for most tasks.andP;  The draft 802.6 MAN standard callsfor a Distributed Queue Dual Bus topology with drops at each servicelocation.andM;Wide area networks (WANs) generally link cities.andP;  Specialized long-distancecarriers lease circuits to organizations and communications companies toconstruct WANs.andP;  You can buy service at any speed, but speeds of 56 and 64kilobits per second or less are the most economical, and 1.544-megabit persecond service is common.andP;  The Federal Communications Commission hasauthority over the rates these long-distance carriers charge.andM;MAN and WAN carriers can offer many services, in addition to providing thebasic circuits.andP;  If the carrier adds packet routing and error detection usinga protocol like X.25, the WAN becomes a VAN (value added network).andP;  Companieslike Tymnet, Telenet, ATandamp;T, and Computer Sciences Corp. provide X.25 VANservices over their WANs.andM;The dividing lines between LANs, MANs, and WANs, aren't written in stone, andsome organizations have campuswide LANs covering many miles that deliver&quot;local&quot; performance.andM;FRAMING AND PARITY ERRORSandM;The modem management system on our local area network regularly reportsframing errors and parity errors.andP;  We use some of the networked modems toexchange electronic mail between LANs and others to access mainframecomputers under IBM's Synchronous Data Link Control (SDLC).andP;  What do theseerrors mean?andP;  Should we do anything about them?andM;Fred Berdick Las Vegas, NevadaandM;Framing errors occur when the receiver in a modem or RS-232C interfaceexpects a stop bit and finds a logical 0 instead.andP;  Since the receiver knowsthat a stop bit follows a start bit after a certain number of data bits, itanticipates the stop bit.andP;  If it doesn't receive the expected stop bit, itdeclares an error.andM;You can get framing errors in either asynchronous or synchronoustransmissions, but they are more likely to occur in the asynchronoustransmission you use to move e-mail between LANs.andM;A parity error is a little different, but the effect is the same.andP;  Thereceiver calculates the parity of a block of data and compares the expectedvalue with the actual value.andP;  If the two values don't agree, the receiverlatches up an error flag.andM;These errors don't hurt you immediately, because the file transfer protocolsand SDLC detect errors and request a retransmission of data.andP;  But any errorsyou get reduce throughput and therefore increase your costs for connectiontime on the leased or dialed-up telephone line.andM;USING FIBER OPTICS IN PC LANSandM;You've often suggested that people wire their buildings for networks withunshielded twisted pair wire, but you don't discuss fiber optics much.andP;  Isn'tfiber the way of the future?andP;  Don't we need the higher speed of fiber opticsfor big graphics applications and to take advantage of the new, fast serversand operating systems like NetWare 386?andM;Brea Lambert Wilmington, North CarolinaandM;Pulling fiber-optic cable throughout a building doesn't ensure thattechnology won't pass you by.andP;  First, you should understand that today'sfiber-optic adapters for LANs don't give you faster throughput than coppercables.andP;  Typical fiber-optic systems today shouldn't be confused with the100-megabit-per-second systems promised under the Fiber Distributed DataInterface (FDDI) specification.andP;  They are very different.andM;Networks using fiber-optic cable gain two benefits: they don't send out orintercept RF (radio frequency) radiation and signals travel farther with lessattenuation.andM;Reducing transmitted RF is important if you don't want anyone to tap intoyour network by receiving and decoding the low-level signals all networksemit.andP;  A detailed body of knowledge and standards known by the acronymTEMPEST defines techniques for reducing electronic emissions.andP;  TEMPEST isimportant to many organizations with big budgets--primarily in or associatedwith the federal government.andP;  DCA 10Net ((513) 433-2238) has a group sellingTEMPEST-certified fiber-optic LANs to organizations such as the FBI.andP;  If youaren't concerned about sophisticated attempts at network intrusion, thisvirtue of fiber networks won't impress you.andM;However, the ability of fiber LANs to shrug off outside interference mightturn your head.andP;  Electrical and electronic noises in many buildings, noisesfrom elevator relays, radio transmitters, faulty electrical equipment, andmany other sources can disrupt the effective throughput of networks.andO;Networks using fiber-optic cable simply don't pick up electrical noises.andM;Because the noise level is lower and because the light pulses lose less powerover a given length of fiber cable than electrical signals do over wire, datasignals travel farther without regeneration.andP;  Signal timing considerationsoften limit the practical amount of distance you gain with fiber optics, butif you have a long cable run, fiber could reduce signal loss.andM;The logical uses for fiber-optic LAN connections today are in networksrequiring very high reliability and in single runs through areas of highelectrical noise.andP;  Choosing fiber isn't an either-or situation.andP;  Severalcompanies market fiber-optic transceivers that connect to standard LANadapter boards and allow you to replace cable with fiber on specific legs.andO;You can buy fiber-optic adapters for ARCnet, Ethernet, and Token-Ringnetworks.andP;  Centralized hubs can interconnect fiber, coax, and twisted-paircable on these networks.andM;Companies ranging from ATandamp;T to Zenith market products that let you mix andmatch fiber and other media in networks.andP;  Codenoll ((914) 965-6300) was oneof the first companies selling fiber LAN adapters for PCs, SynOpticsCommunications ((415) 960-1100) is the fastest growing, and Optical DataSystems ((214) 234-6400) has the broadest range of products.andM;The Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) specification emerging from theAmerican National Standards Institute (ANSI) describes networks a world apartfrom the fiber-optic techniques commonly used in LANs today.andP;  The FDDI cableis different, the signaling is different, and the applications will bedifferent.andP;  FDDI is high speed, long distance, and expensive.andP;  Announcementsof real FDDI products have come from companies as diverse as Hewlett-Packardand SimpleNET Systems.andP;  As soon as products arrive in the LAN Labs we'll tellyou what they can do, but today's Ethernet, ARCnet, and Token-Ring networkswon't be replaced by FDDI as it's described today.andM;NETWORK YOUR QUESTIONSandM;Connectivity gives you practical solutions to networking problems of alltypes.andP;
