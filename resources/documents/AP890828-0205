Newer immigrants create some stressin Dearborn, dotted with Arabic coffeehouses, restaurants and markets andhome to some 20,000 Arabs. ``Their view of Islam often differs from theothers,'' he says, recalling one mosque whose congregation was assimilated,longtime Arab immigrants.    ``Now you go back and it looks like a sceneout of southern Lebanon,'' Abraham says. Arab Christians also maintainedtheir own churches and many still do.    New arrivals come to join familieshere, or seek comfort in a place with the familiarity of their homeland.But they find life harder than did their predecessors.    ``What you seeis Hollywood. Go to America, the land of milk and honey. It's not anymore.It's totally different than what they were told,'' says Haifa Fakhouri,director of the Arab-American and Chaldean Communities Social Services.   At ACCESS, more than 16,000 families last year received English lessonsand help with immigration, jobs, medical care, clothing and housing.``The problem is, they need everything,'' Ahmed says.    ``Twenty-fivepercent unemployment in Detroit is better than getting your head busted,''says George Moses, past president of the National Association of Arab Americans,the only registered lobbying group for immigrants and their descendants.``America has been good to Arab-Americans.''    As earlier immigrantsjoin the mainstream, they say they're less tied to the diverse Arab community.But Arab antipathy doesn't make distinctions between the various nations,religions or cultures. Ties that bind include fighting discrimination orproblems in their homeland.    ``You get a crisis, like a war in the MiddleEast, people pull together, but it's temporal,'' Abraham says.    ``Thereis a general feeling of pan-Arabism. One, they have a culture, a history,a background worth preserving. And there is a feeling that Arabs haven'tgotten a fair shake. And third, there's a feeling we're under attack _stereotyping.''    Stereotyping is blamed for unconfirmed reportsthat Nazir Jaafar of Dearborn may have unwittingly carried the bomb thatcaused the Pan Am crash, Ahwal says. Intimidations, like last year's scrawlingsat the Arab couple's home, increased in greater Detroit this year, shesays.    ``The terrorist _ it goes with Arab _ they'll put it in the dictionary:Arab terrorist. There are no other terrorists,'' says Osama Siblani, whocreated a bilingual newspaper in 1984 because she ``was tired of beingportrayed as a camel jockey.''    ``I was in Beirut when American-madejets were bombing my hometown. And I hated Americans. But when I came,I saw a different story,'' says Siblani, who emigrated after attendingcollege in Michigan 12 years ago.    Siblani, like national ADC officials,believes Arabs are more accepted than a few years ago.    ``It's partlyeducation efforts of organizations like ours,'' and also because mediacoverage of the Palestine uprising ``has humanized it'' in the past 18months, Bouhafa says.    The ADC discontinued its yearly violencereport. Its 1986 report found the most incidents in Michigan, followedby California, Washington, D.C., and New York.    Southern Californiahas the second-largest Arab-American concentration, and another large populationis in New York.    Raising public consciousness was one goal when theADC was founded in 1980 after outrage over ``Abscam,'' the FBI corruptioninvestigation that had agents posing as wealthy sheiks.    The ADC andNAAA are quick to point out well-known Arab-Americans: F. Murray Abraham,who won an Oscar for his portrayal of Wolfgang Mozart's jealous rival composerin the movie ``Amadeus,'' U.S. Senate majority leader George Mitchell,actor Danny Thomas, heart surgeon Michael DeBakey, radio's Casey Kasem,poet Kahlil Gibran, Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Doug Flutie, consumeradvocate Ralph Nader and teen pop singer Tiffany. In early days, many well-knownArab Americans tended to play down their ethnicity, fade into the fabricof society.    ``Now it's spinning, it's going to take off. We just hadan Arab-American appointed in the White House,'' Siblani said, referringto White House chief of staff John Sununu, whose grandfather was Lebanese.``They're starting right now, the American public, to realize we're partof the salad bowl. We will add to the texture of this country, a new ingredient.''</TEXT></DOC>
