Karr (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> ECO EMI </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Nonfarm productivity declined at an annual rate of 0.2% in the fourth quarter, trimming the productivity rise for all of 1987 to 0.8%, the Labor Department reported.    Last year's increase was only half the 1.6% rise in nonfarm productivity for 1986 and the smallest since 1982, when the productivity measure declined 0.6%.    The fourth-quarter drop followed a third-quarter increase at a revised annual rate of 4.2%, which was the largest rise since early 1986, the department said in its preliminary report. Previously, the third-quarter increase had been put at 3.6%. The quarterly figures are adjusted for seasonal variations.    The latest statistics on productivity, the measure of output for each hour worked, follow several other reports suggesting that an economic slowdown is on the horizon.    The Commerce Department reported last month that the real gross national product -- the total inflation-adjusted output of goods and services -- grew at a robust 4.2% annual rate in the fourth quarter after rising at a 4.3% pace in the third quarter. But the increase was largely the result of a heavy inventory buildup as consumer spending weakened, and many analysts contend that production is slowing in the current quarter as businesses work off excess stocks.    Productivity usually rises steeply in the early stages of a business recovery and tapers off in the later stages as output slows relative to the number of workers. The current recovery has lasted a comparatively long five years, but productivity gains haven't been as strong as those posted in previous recoveries. The peak for the current expansion was 3.3% in 1983.    The fourth-quarter productivity lag apparently reflected employer efforts to catch up with rising production, a Labor Department economist said. He said businesses were able to boost output in the second and third quarters with a much smaller increase in hours worked, but in the fourth quarter they stepped up both hiring and overtime.    The result: a 5.1% rise in the annual rate of nonfarm production in the fourth quarter was more than offset by a 5.3% increase in the rate of hours worked. Hourly nonfarm compensation rose at a 3.4% rate, in nominal terms, but declined at an 0.1% rate when inflation was taken into account. Unit labor costs increased at a 3.7% annual rate, the largest in a year.    For all of 1987, nonfarm output rose 3.4% and hours worked increased 2.6%. Hourly compensation rose 2.8% nominally but dropped 0.8% when adjusted for inflation, the biggest decline since 1981. Unit labor costs rose 2%.    Manufacturing productivity edged upward at an annual rate of 0.1% in the fourth quarter, after sizable increases through the first three quarters.    For the year, manufacturing productivity increased 3.3%, trailing the 3.7% rise of 1986, but outstripping a 0.9% rise in the overall business sector for 1987. Manufacturing output rose 4.3%, up from a 2.8% rise in 1986, while hours worked increased 1%, after a 0.9% decline in 1986. Unit labor costs declined 1.9% last year.    Overall business productivity declined at a 0.7% rate in the fourth quarter and rose 0.9% for the year. </TEXT></DOC>
