Just as a biological virus disrupts living cells to causedisease, a computer virus invades data processors and disruptsnormal operation of the machines.   A virus duplicates itself, spreading into other programs in thecomputer and infecting one computer after another as users sharefloppy disks or link up over telephone lines.   Mild viruses may do nothing more than flash a provocative messageon a user's screen; ``deadly'' forms can destroy data or cripple acomputer. Some are ``time bombs'' designed to wreak havoc on apre-programmed date.
