SpiegelmanandM;As 25MHz and 33MHz 80386 computers begin to reach the market, and as pricesfor memory chips drop, prices for slower '386 computers have plunged belowthe $2,000 mark.andM;PC mail-order house CompuAdd Corp., for example, recently slashed $1,000 offthe price of its 16MHz '386 unit, according to Ed Thomas, vice president andgeneral manager for the Austin, Texas, firm.andM;''We changed the price because we recently added a 20MHz and a 25MHz computerto our product line.andP;  We wanted to put some room between this machine and the$2,295-priced 20MHz computer,'' he said.andM;With its $1,895 price tag, CompuAdd's 16MHz computer comes with 1M byte ofmemory, expandable to 4M bytes on the motherboard, a floppy disk, a keyboard,and an integrated floppy- and hard-drive controller.andP;  The computer also comesequipped with seven expansion slots (one 32-bit memory slot, five 16-bitslots and two 8-bit slots) and a socket for a math coprocessor.andM;CompuAdd's computers, which are based on chip sets from Chips andamp; TechnologiesInc., are available directly from the company or from the company's dealerstores.andM;While some PC makers traditionally offer lower prices than others, thesinking cost of memory chips is causing 80386 prices to drop across theboard, according to PC makers.andP;  Dell Computer Corp. recently dropped $1,000off the price tag of its 80386 computers.andP;  Club American Technologies Inc.andO;(Club AT) has done the same.andM;''We raised our PC prices last June about 10 percent,'' said Neil Mehta,president of the Fremont, Calif., PC maker.andM;''Now we are lowering our prices about 11 percent because the memory-chipprices are getting lower and the availability is getting greater,'' he added.andM;Club AT recently reduced the price of its 386SX-based computer, the Model316, from $2,499 to $1,595.andP;  Also, the Club Model 320 computer, a 20MHz,80386-based computer, which was priced at $3,595, now costs $2,595.andP;  Theseprices include 1M byte of memory, a floppy drive and a keyboard.andP;  Graphics, amonitor and a hard disk are not included.andM;''The lower prices are great,'' said Harry Bolan, technical projects managerwith Westinghouse Trading Co., in Pittsburgh.andP;  ''I like things to becompetitive, and I like getting more computing power at affordable prices.andM;''[Previously], raised memory prices hadn't changed our buying decisions, butit caused some internal debates,'' he explained.andM;The price cuts are spurring compatibles makers to introduce new '386s at alower price point.andM;Micro 1 Inc., for example, last month introduced a 20MHz, 80386 computer for$1,995.andP;  Micro 1's computer, called the Power 386-20, comes with 1M byte ofmemory, which is expandable to 8M bytes, a 30M-byte hard-disk drive, a floppydrive, a 12-inch monitor and a monochrome graphics card.andM;Micro 1 sells its computers, which are also based on Chips and Technologies'chip sets, directly to end users, as well as through its dealers.andM;Another PC maker selling a 20MHz, 80386 computer for $1,999 is NationalMicrosystems, of Norcross, Ga.andP;  That computer comes with 1M byte of memory, afloppy- and a hard-disk controller, a floppy drive and a keyboard.andM;DTK Computer Inc., of City of Industry, Calif., markets a bare-bones 20MHz,'386 computer with 640K bytes of memory for $1,695.andM;Other PC makers with low-priced 16MHz and 20MHz computers on the marketinclude FiveStar Computers, Focus Technology, Dataworld Inc., ComputerComponents Corp. and Clone Technologies Inc.andM;By comparison, high-end compatibles maker Compaq Computer Corp., of Houston,sells its 20MHz, 80386 computer, the Deskpro 386/20E, for $5,199.andP;  That priceincludes 1M byte of memory, a keyboard, Video Graphics Array-compatiblegraphics and a floppy-disk drive.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
