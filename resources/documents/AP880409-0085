Clearly, this was not your ordinary, 200-pound black bear. Hewas shopping for groceries in the 5,000-population community, anduntil Thursday night hadn't done too badly for himself.   ``They had to block off streets,'' said Cloverdale policedispatcher Shauna Tipler. ``Not to keep the bear from the people,but the people from the bear. They loved it. It was comical. Therewas this bear walking around town followed by a huge crowd.''   It was the young bear's third straight nocturnal visit to thistown 80 miles north of San Francisco. His earlier trips won himmeals of chickens and ducks, but the bear's third foray from theforest proved unlucky.   After a state Department of Fish and Game trap failed, a citizencommittee of ad hoc vigilantes chased the bruin 35 feet up a tree,where a police sharpshooter shot him with a tranquilizer gun. Thegroggy beast hung onto a branch for about 10 minutes before fallinginto a giant canvas held by about 20 people.   The snoozing bear got a free ride to a holding cage at RanchoCordova near Sacramento and will be released into the wild later,Fish and Game spokesman Jim Swanson reported.   ``It's just a young foolish bear,'' said Swanson. ``He's just akid.''</TEXT><DATELINE>NORMAL, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   It took only a single anonymous vote, but anIllinois State University student wasn't complaining about theunexpected launch of his political career.   Diego Alvarado, 24, of Normal received one write-in vote forMcLean County circuit clerk in the March 15 Democratic primary. Noone else ran for the nomination and another person who received awrite-in vote declined it.   Alvarado said Friday he would run in the November generalelection for the clerk's office, which employs 55 people and keepstrack of court paperwork.   ``I take this step because I believe the circuit clerk's officeshould work primarily to serve the public,'' Alvarado said Friday.   The political science junior has never held an elected publicoffice, but he was a delegate for Gary Hart at the 1984 DemocraticNational Convention in San Francisco and has been active in campuspolitical groups.   ``I feel I have something to offer the voters,'' he said. ``It'sbeen in my mind to run for office. And I've been involved inpolitics all my life.''   McLean County Democratic Party chairman John Penn welcomedAlvarado's decision to run, but the Republican nominee, 40-year-oldSharon Siron, expressed some disappointment..   ``There was no one on the Democratic ticket at the time of theprimary, and I was hoping I wouldn't have a race in November,'' shesaid. ``But I hear it's fun to campaign all summer.''</TEXT></DOC>
