Sen. John Kerry is already talking about immediately terminating $40 million of the $100 million Congress voted last year. Last week, Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams met in Miami with the foreign minister of Costa Rica to discuss a new peace initiative, which will be presented to Latin American and European diplomats in the next few weeks. Special negotiator Philip C. Habib also will be sent to Central America next week to discuss these proposals further.    Difficult as this issue has been, progress is always easier if the opposing sides share some measure of common ground. Common ground on Nicaragua has at last emerged: Sen. Chris Dodd announced last week that the present Sandinista government is intolerable.    &quot;In January 1987,&quot; he asked, &quot;is there anyone who doubts that the Sandinistas' political, military and economic ties to Moscow and Havana are stronger than they were in January 1981? Is there anyone who doubts that there are more Cuban, Soviet and Soviet-bloc advisers, both military and civilian, in Nicaragua than there were when Ronald Reagan took office? Is there anyone who doubts that the size of the Sandinista armed forces bears any relationship to the ragtag militia that overthrew the Somoza dynasty? And is there anyone who doubts that there is less political freedom in Nicaragua, less press freedom and less religious freedom than there was when President Reagan was inaugurated?&quot;    The question on the table now is what do we do about it?    Sen. Dodd argues that this catalog of horrors is Ronald Reagan's fault; the Sandinistas have been driven to communism because of Mr. Reagan's policies. Now, says the senator, the contras' funds &quot;must stop&quot; and any further fundings should be used &quot;to disband and relocate the contra forces.&quot; He feels &quot;there is every reason to believe that the Sandinista leadership is prepared to sign the kind of agreement that would go a long way toward eliminating our immediate national-security concerns.&quot;    We've arrived at the heart of the matter. The policy of the administration's opponents is that if the contras go, Nicaragua's pro-communist government will sign an agreement, and our Central American security problems will go away.    Communists have sat down at tables in the past and what has come out of their mouths has been called &quot;negotiations.&quot; But history does not record evidence of communists in control of a government negotiating to share their power or reduce it. Why are we being asked to take on faith that this group, not far off our southern border, will be the first to do so?    History shows that left alone, new communist governments clearly understand their priorities: military growth and the weakening through intimidation of their neighbors. The Sandinistas have increased their inventory of Soviet helicopter gunships. A huge Soviet-Bulgarian construction project is now under way in the Atlantic port town of El Bluff. Port facilities would accommodate large Cuban boats carrying military hardware that must now risk detection during passage through the Panama Canal. A presence on Nicaragua's Atlantic coast would dramatically increase Soviet influence in the strategically important Caribbean region. Have the administration's opponents even begun to give reasons why Managua would negotiate away any of this?    Assistant Secretary Abrams said late last week that the only way the U.S. is going to get anywhere on this problem &quot;is through the military pressure that the contras can put on the Sandinista regime.&quot; Surely Mr. Abrams is correct. Assuming the junta in Managua wants to negotiate anything, that won't happen until it is preoccupied with a threat to its regime. That pressure has just begun with the disbursement of money Congress approved. However, the idea is now circulating in Washington that the contras must produce &quot;results&quot; within several months to win further support in the current budget round. &quot;Instant results&quot; is the sort of thinking you would expect from people who get their ideas of strategy and success from watching NFL games. No communist government will negotiate anything unless it is under strong, long-term pressure.    We are encouraged in any event that a consensus is forming around the fact that in Nicaragua we are dealing with communists. The more productive question now before us asks, what is it in the interests of the U.S. to do about them? </TEXT></DOC>
