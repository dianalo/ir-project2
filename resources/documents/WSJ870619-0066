Continental, a unit of Texas Air Corp., said passengers would now be able to buy two days in advance discount plane tickets that previously required a seven-day advance purchase.    The fares, which carry a 25% cancellation penalty, generally are about 35% cheaper than Continental's unrestricted discount fares, a spokesman said.    New York-based Trans World Airlines said it would match Continental's move, as did American Airlines, a unit of Dallas-based AMR Corp. and USAir, a unit of USAir Group Inc. based in Arlington, Va.    Piedmont Airlines and United Airlines said they'll match Continental's fare change in markets where the two carriers compete. Piedmont is owned by Winston-Salem, N.C.-based Piedmont Aviation Inc.; United is a unit of Chicago-based Allegis Corp.    A Delta Air Lines spokesman said the Atlanta-based carrier is still studying Continental's change and a spokesman for Northwest Airlines, a unit of NWA Inc. of St. Paul, Minn., said the company hasn't decided whether it will follow suit.    In New York, Pan American World Airways, a unit of Pan Am Corp., said the Continental move won't affect its fare structure because it doesn't impose restrictions.    Continental left unchanged two cheaper fare levels, both of which require sevenday advance purchase and carry other restrictions.    Continental's lowest-cost fare is the MaxSaver, which has a 100% cancellation penalty. Its other lower fare level, which carries a 50% cancellation penalty, is more expensive than MaxSaver fares but less expensive than the fares with the 25% cancellation penalty.    The two-day advance purchase fares would cost $352 round-trip between New York and Los Angeles, compared with $272 round-trip on a fare that carries a 50% cancellation penalty and $252 round-trip for the MaxSavers. Continental's unrestricted discount fare on the route would be $574 and an undiscounted coach seat would cost $694 round-trip. </TEXT></DOC>
