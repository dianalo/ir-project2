John T.andO;Barnett Ralph A. Hiller Co. Pittsburgh, Pa.andM;A  There are two ways to find records quickly.andP;  One method is the RangeSearch command, which is available in 1-2-3 Releases 2.2 and 3.andP;  The othermethod, which is available in all releases of 1-2-3, is the Data Query Findcommand.andM;To follow the discussion, create a database by entering the labels in row 1and range B2..C6 of the following figure.andP;  Use the @DATE formula to enter thedates in column A and assign them the Date 2 format.andM;The Range Search command can locate a specified sequence of characters withinany label or formula in a selected range.andP;  Suppose you want to find Beam'srecord.andP;  Select /Range Search and indicate range A1..C6.andP;  1-2-3 displays theprompt Enter string to search for.andP;  Enter Beam and select Labels.andM;1-2-3 displays a menu with the options Find and Replace.andP;  The Replace optionlets you indicate a string that 1-2-3 should substitute for any occurrence ofBeam that it finds in the database.andP;  You don't want to change Beam, so selectFind.andM;The cell pointer jumps to cell B4, and 1-2-3 displays a menu with the optionsNext and Quit.andP;  You would select Next to move the cell pointer to the nextBeam in the database.andP;  Since there is only one record for Beam, select Quitto end the search.andP;  The cell pointer remains at the selected record.andM;The Data Query Find command is more versatile because it lets you specify aset of criteria that a record must meet.andP;  If a record meets the criteria, thecommand highlights the record so that you can read and edit it.andM;Before you issue the Find command, you must enter the criterion and specifythe Input and Criterion ranges.andP;  Enter Name into cell E1, and enter Beam intocell E2.andP;  Select /Data Query Input and indicate range A1..C6.andP;  SelectCriterion and indicate range E1..E2, then select Find.andP;  1-2-3 highlightsBeam's record.andM;While the record is highlighted, you can move the cursor from one field tothe next and replace existing entries, or you can press the EDIT key tochange the entries.andP;  Use the UpArrow and DownArrow keys to highlight otherrecords that match the criterion.andP;  When you finish perusing the records thatmatch the criterion, press Return and then select Quit to end the Findoperation.andP;  The cell pointer returns to where it was when you issued the DataQuery Find command.andP;  Alternatively, you can press the QUERY key to end theFind operation and leave the cell pointer in the last highlighted record.andM;1-2-3/SYMPHONYandM;Days to year endandM;Q  I'd like to have 1-2-3 calculate the number of days left in the currentyear.andP;  The formula I use requires that I update an @DATE formula at thebeginning of a new year, but I'd like to eliminate that task.andP;  Anysuggestions?andM;Charles H. Marks Charles Marks andamp; Associates Boston, Mass.andM;A  The following formula returns the total number of days left in the currentyear, not including today:andM;@DATE(@YEAR(@NOW),12,31)-@INT(@NOW)andM;If you want to include today in the count, change the formula to thefollowing:andM;@DATE(@YEAR(@NOW+1),1,1)- @INT(@NOW)andM;No links toandM;protected filesandM;Q  I created a main file linked by formulas to six subordinate files in 1-2-3Release 2.2.andP;  Then I protected the subordinate files with passwords.andP;  When Iretrieves the main file, all the linking formulas returned ERR.andP;  How can Ialter the linking formulas so that they'll return values from the protectedfiles?andM;Cecilia A. Mulhollen Paccar Government Group Kirkland, Wash.andM;A  A file that's already referenced in a linking formula in 1-2-3 Release 2.2or Symphony Release 2.2 cannot be protected with a password.andP;  If you removepassword protection from the six subordinate files, the linking formulas willreturn the values from those files the next time you retrieve the main file.andO;For more information on linking fiels, refer to &quot;Cell Mates&quot; on page 74 ofthe July issue.andM;Tricky Data QueryandM;Q  Our social service agency produces a monthly report showing each clientserved and the month of service.andP;  We combine this report into a year-to-dateworksheet and sort the list by client and date of service.andP;  Each month we'dlike to see which clients have not received service in the previous threemonths.andM;For example, the following illustration shows part of the database from theend of August.andP;  Yates and Morton were served in April and May, respectively,but not after those dates.andP;  Each of the other clients was served in JuneMJuly, or August.andP;  What commands can extract the appropriate records?andM;Robert G. Toone New York State Association for Retarded Children Buffalo,N.Y.andM;A  This is a stricky database query.andP;  You must perform two databaseoperations using two different sets of criteria.andM;The first database operation extracts from the database the records ofclients served in the past three months.andP;  Those records become the criteriafor a second operation, which deletes from the database every record thatcontains an extracted name.andP;  This leaves behind the records of the clientswho weren't served in the past three months.andP;  Unfortunately, it also altersyour database, but we'll deal with that in a moment.andM;To follow this discussion, start in a blank worksheet and enter the labelsshown in row 1 and column A of the preceding figure.andP;  Use the @DATE formulato enter the dates in column B.andP;  Enter each date as the first of the month.andO;For example, enter @DATE(90,6,1) into cell B2.andP;  Format the dates by selecting/Range (in Symphony, MENU) Format Date 3 and indicating range B2..B10.andP;  Copycell B1 to cell A13 and cell A1 to cell A16.andP;  Then enter the formula +B2[isgreater than]@DATE(90,6,1) into cell A14.andM;To specify the database ranges, select /Data Query Input (in a Symphony SHEETwindow, selct MENU Query Settings Basic Database) and indicate range A1..B10.andO;Then select Criterion and indicate range A13..A14.andP;  Select Output andindicate cell A16.andP;  Select Extract Quit (in Symphony, Quit Quit ExtractQuit).andP;  Range A17..A21 contains a list of the clients who were served in thepast three months.andM;Save the worksheet! You're going to use the Data Query Delete (in Symphony,Query Delete) command, which permanently erases records from the database, somake sure there's a copy of this worksheet stored on disk.andP;  You may want tosave a second copy of the worksheet under a new name.andP;  By saving the filewith a new name you prevent someone from accidentally saving the modifiedworksheet in palce of the original.andM;After you save the file, reassign the Criterion range.andP;  Move the cell pointerto cell A16.andP;  Select /Data Query Criterion (In Symphony, MENU Query SettingsBasic Criterion) and press Backspace to clear the existing range.andP;  Then pressthe period, End, DownArrow, and Return keys--in that order.andM;Next, select Delete Delete Quit (in Symphony, Quit Quit Delete Yes Quit).andO;The database shrinks to the records of Morton and Yates, the only clients whoweren't served in the past three months.andM;Don't same the worksheet without assigning a name other than the one used onyour original year-to-date file.andP;  To preserve the list of clients not servedin the past three months, either print out the worksheet or use the FileXtract command to create a separate file containing only these client names.andO;When you wish to continue working with the original year-to-date worksheet,simply retrieve it.andM;If y ou want to speed up the two database operations, try the macro shown inthe following worksheet:andM;The Symphony equivalent follows:andM;Enter the labels shown for the spreadsheet product you're using.andP;  Begin theentry in cell E1 with an apostrophe label prefix.andP;  If you're using 1-2-3, youmust also begin the entry in cell F1 with a label prefix.andP;  Use the Range NameCreate command to assign the following range names:andM;Name  Range dbase  A1..B10 crit1  A13..A14 out1  A16 \e  F1andM;To isolate the names of clients who haven't received service in the pastthree months, hold down the MACRO key (Alt on most computers) and press E.andO;Remember:  Do not save the worksheet after you run the macroandM;Remove passwordandM;protectionandM;Q  When saving files, I sue passwords to protect them from unauthorizedaccess.andP;  How can I remove the password protection? Sanjay Jain Rowley, Mass.andM;A  When you select /File Save (in Symphony, SERVICES File Save) and type afile name, you have the option of pressing the Spacebar and typing the letterP.andP;  When you do this, the software prompts you to enter a password.andP;  Apassword can be up to 15 characters long and is case sensitive.andP;  To make sureyou've entered the password correctly, the software prompts you to enter it asecond time.andP;  Remember the password, or write it down and keep it safe.andP;  Ifyou forget a file's password, you cannot retrieve the file.andM;To remove password protection from a file you have retrieved, select /FileSave (In Symphony, SERVICES File Save) and press the Backspace or Delete keyto delete the characters [PASSWORD PROTECTED] that appear next to the filename.andP;  Then press Return and select Replace (in Symphony, Yes) to save thefile without the password.andM;REVISITEDandM;Retrieve files fastandM;In the February issue, page 69, you provided Kevin Pyle with a macro thatwould allow him to highlight a file's name to retrieve that file.andM;Why not use the NAME key instead?andP;  When you select/File Retrieve and pressNAME, 1-2-3 displays a full-screen list of all the file names in the currentdirectory.andP;  You can select a file to retrieve by moving the cell pointer fromname to name.andP;  1-2-3 also displays information about each file, such as thedate and time the file was last saved and the file size.andM;It seems like extra work to write a macro when this feature exists in theproduct.andP;  Philip Schwartzberg Kibbutz Urim Doar Na, Negev IsraelandM;The editor replies: Using the Name key to display a list of available filenames is a handy trick.andP;  Symphony users can press the MENU or the SERVICESkey to produce a similar full-screen list of file names.andM;We didn't discuss the NAME key in our original response because Kevin Pylestated that he wanted to be able to move the cell pointer around within alist of file names that he stored in a worksheet.andP;  Certainly, anyoneretrieving a spreadsheet file will benefit from learning how to use the NAMEkey in conjunction with the File Retrieve command.andM;Right-alignedandM;underlinesandM;In the November issue, page 90, Kim Bussy noted that the quotation mark labelprefix doesn't align a label with the right edge of a cell.andP;  Instead, itleaves a space between the end of the label and the cell's right boundary.andM;I use a formula to automatically generate an underline that begins onecharacter from the left edge of a cell and extends to the right edge.andP;  Forexample, enter the values shown in range A1..C4 of the following figure.andO;Then assign to range A1..B4 the , (Comma) (in Symphony, Punctuated) formatwith one decimal place and to range C1..C4 the Percent (in Symphony, %)format with zero decimal places.andM;Then enter the following formula in cell A5 and copy cell A5 to range B5..C5:+&quot;&quot;&quot;andamp;@REPEAT(&quot;-&quot;,@CELL(&quot;width&quot;, A4..A4)-1)andM;The advantage of this formula is that if you change the width of a column,the length of the underline changes automatically when you recalculate theworksheet.andP;  Kathleen Goeldner Baxter Healthcare Corp. El Paso, Tex.andM;The editor replies: Another advantage of the formula is that you can enter itonce and copy it to the cells that you want to contain underlines.andP;  Theunderline generated by each formula will immediately reflect the width of thecurrent column.andM;Calculate a commissionandM;In the April issue, page 80, Bob Carr asked how to calculate a commissionusing a progressive-scale system.andP;  The scale is as follows:andM;* Up to $50,000 earns 12%andM;* Second $50,000 earns 9%andM;* Anything over $100,000 earns 7%andM;Although the formula we provided works, many readers found it too complex,and they suggested alternative formulas.andP;  Most people who responded suggestedthe following formula, or a variation of it, to calculate the commission of avalue stored in cell A1:andM;@IF(A1[is greater than]=100000,(A1-100000)*.07+ 10500,@IF(A1[is greaterthan]50000,(A1-50000)* .09+6000,A1*.12))andM;The shortest formula submitted was:andM;+A1*.07+@MIN(100000,A1)*.02+@MIN (50000,A1)*.03andM;This formula capitalizes on the decrease in commission from one level ofsales to the next.andP;  The formula's first expressiuon, +A1*.07, accounts forthe fact that any sale will receive at least a 7% commission.andM;The expression @MIN(100000,A1)*.02 adds a 2% commission to any sale below$100,000.andP;  The final expression, @MIN(50000,A1)*.03, adds another 3%commission to any sale less than $50,000.andM;Thanks to all of our readers who submitted simplified formulas.andP;  Robert A.andO;Kelly of Florham Park, N.J., not only sent the first letter, but he came upwith both formulas.andM;CONTESTandM;This month's contest asks readers to suggest a formula or formulas that canconvert a value into a string in Comma format with zero decimal places.andP;  Forexample, if cell A1 contains the value 108108, the final formula shouldreturn the string 108,108.andP;  If you change the value in cell A1 to 108108108,the final formula should return 108,108,108.andM;This contest idea was submitted by Jacob Braun of Marine Midland Bank, NewYork, N.Y.andM;The first 2k people who submit what the LOTUS judges consider to be the bestanswer will receive a LOTUS Swiss Army knife.andM;Please send us a disk copy and a printed copy of  your answer withappropriate documentation.andP;  All entries must be postmarked before midnight,Aug. 31, 1990.andP;  Winners will be announced in the November issue.andP;  Mail youranswers to August Contest, LOTUS Magazine, P.O.
