Lublin</HL><DATE>04/18/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE R28</SO><CO>   EUROP</CO><LP>   LONDON -- Not that long ago, executive pay in Europelagged so far behind the princely sums handed out in the U.S.that the gap seemed nearly unbridgeable. To a lot of peoplelike Robert Horton, it must still look that way.   In 1988 he was posted from the U.S., where he headedBritish Petroleum Co.'s American unit, back to Britain, wherehe rejoined the parent's governing board. With this promotion-- he was widely viewed as a candidate for the top job at BPand has since become chairman -- he took a pay cut of 60%</LP><TEXT>   But a lot of other people like Ernest Mario can testifythat executive pay in Europe indeed is beginning to catch upwith that in the U.S., if in an uneven and unequal way. Mr.Mario, who works for Glaxo Holdings PLC, the U.K.'s toppharmaceuticals maker, last year moved to Britain as chiefexecutive from a managing director's spot in the U.S. He gota 30% salary increase to nearly $1 million, pay that puts himon a par with the chieftains of similarly sized companies inthe U.S.   Driven by the increasing globalization of business and theneed to attract scarce managerial talent, executives'earnings across Europe &quot;are moving ahead much more quicklythan those of their peers in the U.S,&quot; says Ron Amy, groupcompensation and benefits director at Grand Metropolitan PLC,the British food and drinks group. &quot;We are seeing a closingof the gap.&quot; Another reason for the upward movement: taxreforms that allow executives to keep more of their earnings.   After adjustment to reflect net purchasing power, atypical European executive now earns 75% as much as a U.S.counterpart -- up from 70% in 1985, estimates Hay Group Inc.Performance bonuses and even stock options are becoming farmore common, too, says Hay.   But does all of this spell true parity with the U.S.before too long? Don't count on it.   The gap between U.S.and European executive compensationmay never close completely. In some parts of the Europeanpatchwork quilt, salaries are so far behind American pay thatcatching up seems well-nigh impossible. Senior executives inwealthy Switzerland come closest to Americans in gross salaryand bonus levels, and someday could match them. But those inless affluent nations such as Portugal and Ireland are far,far off the pace.   Also, there are still too many lingering differences inOld World attitudes, values, tax systems and livingstandards. Nonmonetary rewards -- from a deluxe company carto better job security -- still motivate many Europeanmanagers as much as cold cash. And in a part of the worldwhere socialist tradition still runs deep, those who make awhopping U.S.-style income risk public scorn as greedy fatcats. &quot;To a lot of people, {high pay} sounds obscene,&quot; saysNoel de Berry, an executive recruiter in London's financialdistrict.   Banker Christopher Heath discovered this when his earningsof 2.5 million, largely profit-related, made him Britain'shighest-paid executive for 1986. The outraged tabloid presshounded Mr. Heath, forcing him to disappear for a week andprompting his employer, Baring Brothers andamp; Co., to hire guardsfor his home.   Across the Channel, a satirical French newspaper stirred alot of fresh antagonism into a labor dispute last fall whenit reported that Peugeot SA, the French auto maker, had paidChairman Jacques Calvet a little more than $340,000 in 1988.Though Chrysler chief executive Lee Iacocca earned the samein a little over a month, including stock options, Mr.Calvet's salary increases -- 24% in 1988 and 17% the yearbefore -- infuriated striking Peugeot workers. They hadwalked out over management's refusal to grant them more thana 4.4% annual raise.   This sort of reaction leaves many European companies stillwary about handing out big salaries and performance bonuses.Two-thirds of major European businesses do offer such bonusesnow, compared with 87% in the U.S., and the number has grownrapidly -- but the bonuses often are not as lavish, or spreadamong as many potential recipients, as they are in the U.S.   Peugeot, for one, limits them to only a few topexecutives. French companies generally would like to extendperformance-based pay to a wider management group, saysPeugeot spokesman Martin Alloiteau. But after 40 years ofgovernment with a wide streak of social welfarism, &quot;it's tooearly in France right now,&quot; he adds. &quot;It means a deep changein mentality.&quot;   Similarly, although stock options are gaining ground inEurope, they may not approach their popularity in the U.S.for many years, if ever. According to a recent poll by WyattCo., a U.S. consulting firm, they are now offered by at least25% of the companies in Austria, Denmark, Ireland, theNetherlands, Norway, Spain and the U.K. But they are stillfar less prevalent than in the U.S., and in some Europeancountries with few publicly held businesses andless-developed equity markets, rapid growth in their useseems unlikely.   Also, where they are offered, such options frequently areless generous than in the U.S., are limited to a smallernumber of executives, and sometimes are tied to how well thecompany performs. In Britain, institutional shareholdersemploy guidelines limiting executives' share options to fourtimes their yearly compensation unless they achieve strict,stipulated levels of performance. Such restrictions don'texist in the U.S.   As much as any single factor, the narrower scope and scaleof stock options leaves Europe still a long way from paritywith the U.S. by the most meaningful yardstick -- totalrenumeration. This includes not only salary, bonuses andbenefits but also the value of stock options.   By this standard the chief executive of an Americancompany with sales of $250 million a year received an averageof $543,000 as of January 1989, says Towers Perrin, aU.S.-based benefits consulting firm. A CEO of a similar Swissbusiness earned $307,000, but the head of the same-sizedBritish, German or French company garnered only about halfthe U.S. figure.   However, what European corporations lack in lavish paypackages they often make up for in generous perks. Amongthem: company-subsidized yachts, country estates, gardeners,chauffeurs, home entertainment and personal phone bills. U.K.businesses introduced company cars in the mid-1970s and atone point even paid for business suits.   The suit perk is gone, but the cars are everywhere. Over90% of senior British managers now get company cars -- morethan in the U.S. or anywhere else. It's proof of how highlyconscious Britons remain of accent, dress and other marks ofclass. Some executives even take pay cuts to join businessesoffering fancier sets of wheels.   European managers also get longer vacations than theirU.S. counterparts -- six weeks isn't unusual -- and whileAmericans brag about how rarely they take time off, Britonsand Continentals make a point of taking their vacations. (SirJohn Egan, then Jaguar PLC's chairman, took a one-weekholiday to Barbados last October right in the middle of talkswith General Motors Corp. about a minority linkup. A sourceclose to GM says his departure &quot;raised a few eyebrows&quot; amongGM officials left cooling their heels. Ford Motor Co. woundup buying Jaguar.)   In addition, European executives usually have more jobsecurity and richer pension benefits than their Americanpeers, and assign a high value to both. One London investmentbanker with a six-figure income rejected a U.S. bank'shigher-paying offer last year because he worried he might beout of a job in nine months. &quot;People in the U.K.,&quot; he notes,&quot;work for things other than money.&quot;   He might have added that he who stays put also has abetter chance of getting ahead in Europe. Despite all theexecutive-suite chatter about meritocracy and pay forperformance, employers in Europe still value long servicemore than American bosses do when promotions are made. &quot;A lotof recruitment is done within the old boys' network,&quot; saysJean Van den Eynde, a Brussels-based executive recruiter.&quot;Even when they {European companies} don't have the idealperson around, they will tend to promote from within and hopethat it works out.&quot;   This is one manifestation of a lingering elitism thatstill influences who gets ahead in Europe. American andJapanese competition has diminished the importance of theright accent, education and family ties -- but it has by nomeans eliminated it, particularly in finance.   Last fall, a French executive quit Caisse des Depots etConsignations, a big state-owned investment house, afterrealizing he would never reach upper management because hehadn't attended an elite French university. &quot;In the U.S., youjudge people on what they have done, which is not quite truein Europe,&quot; the disillusioned Frenchman says. &quot;Here, they aremore judged on what they look like and what kind of schoolsthey come from.&quot;   ---   Ms. Lublin is deputy chief of The Wall Street Journal'sLondon bureau.   ---                    Country by Country                                                                                                          Typical 1989 gross pay for chief operating officers,including salary, bonuses and other cash payments   (Based on recent exchange rates)                                                                                                          U.S.                                 $212,640   Switzerland                           152,000   Germany                               144,160   Italy                                 139,360   Spain                                 135.360   Austria                               128,480   France                                125,600   Denmark                               119,520   Netherlands                           116,000   Belgium                               115,520   Sweden                                113,760   U.K.                                  101,760   Norway                                 95,360   Ireland                                81,920   Greece                                 51,200   Portugal                               43,680                                                                                                          Source: P-E Inbucon, U.K. consultants</TEXT></DOC>
