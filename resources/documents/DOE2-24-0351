Samples were madeby a dry process. Some samples were quenched in liquid nitrogen in orderto produce the tetragonal phase. The microstructures for these samplesare very similar, regardless of the kind in the rare earth site. Boundariesbetween grains are well defined by a change in color which probably arisesfrom a difference in crystal orientation. Many grains have rectangularshape as elongated to a certain direction. In the sample with the orthorhombicstructure, the grains contain twins, whereas no twin is observed in thetetragonal sample. (3 figs, 6 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
