Eight children swept away byfloods were among the dead.   The storm, packing winds as high as 115 mph, was heading towardHong Kong, prompting the British colony to order its army to moveabout 11,000 Vietnamese boat people from tent camps to emergencyaccomodations.   Thousands of Hong Kong workers were allowed to leave work earlyand packed subways and buses to get home and prepare for the storm,expected to hit the colony early Tuesday.   Rescue operations in the Philippines today were hampered bystrong winds and heavy rain whipped up by a second tropical stormthat buffeted Manila and the western coast of Luzon Island.   Eight children were drowned Sunday in flooding near the AmburayanRiver near Bangar, about 160 miles north of Manila, the government'sOffice of Civil Defense said.   Nine other people were reported missing in the area, it said.   Four people were killed when heavy rain triggered landslides nearthe mountain resort of Baguio, 130 miles north of Manila.   In the provinces of Isabela and Cagayan, officials said more than1,500 families fled their homes to escape flood waters and more than1,400 homes were destroyed.   Crop damage in the two provinces was estimated at $15.8 million.A bridge linking the two provinces also was heavily damaged by thetyphoon, officials said.   Gordon was the strongest typhoon to strike the Philippines thisyear. It slammed into Luzon, the main Philippines island, earlySunday with winds of up to 116 mph and was reported today headingfor China at 14 miles an hour.   Officials said casualty and damage reports were incompletebecause of flooding in the affected areas, which was worsened by thetropical storm, which was reported today about 490 mileseast-northeast of Batanes, the country's northernmost province, andwas headed toward Japan's Ryukyu Islands at 12 mph with maximumwinds of 47 mph.   Although the storm was well north of the Philippines, thegovernment weather service said it triggered monsoon storms thatdrenched Manila and other areas of Luzon with heavy rain.   Philippine Airlines canceled two domestic flights because oftoday's storm, and major highways linking Manila with northern Luzonwere impassable due to floods.</TEXT></DOC>
