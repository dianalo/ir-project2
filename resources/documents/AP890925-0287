On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the November contract forWest Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of crude oil, rose 18cents to close at $19.46 a 42-gallon barrel. December crude rose 20cents to $19.32 and January advanced 22 cents to $19.21 a barrel.   Among refined products, heating oil for October delivery added0.54 cent to finish at 57.51 cents a gallon, while other contractmonths posted slightly higher gains.   Unleaded gasoline for October delivery, which had risen lastweek after reports of hurricane damage to a big refinery in St.Croix, Virgin Islands, declined 0.28 cent to 61.67 cents a gallon.November slipped 0.3 cent to 58.13 cents, while contracts for laterdelivery rose.   Traders said the meeting of the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries in Geneva dominated the day's trading. Late inthe day, some OPEC delegates said the cartel was close to signingan agreement that would formalize OPEC's production at about 21million barrels. However, a meeting scheduled late in the day wasabruptly postponed until Tuesday.   Iraqi Oil Minister Issam Al-Chalabi said the delay was due toslight differences among some members over the exact quota.   OPEC has a stated ceiling of 19.5 million barrels a day, butso-called cheating by some of the 13 members has put theoil-producing group's actual production at about 22 million barrels.   Some OPEC sources have said they believe current world demand isenough to sustain a higher quota without weakening prices. Althoughcrude prices are below levels of this spring, they have remained inthe $19-$20 range.   Analysts said legitimizing OPEC's production at around 21million barrels a day probably would not dampen prices as long asmembers stick to the agreement.</TEXT></DOC>
