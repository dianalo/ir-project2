The assessment provides a basisfor the conclusion that the field testing of those genetically engineeredtobacco plants does not present a risk of plant pest introduction or disseminationand also will not have any significant impact on the quality of the humanenvironment.

The rule regulates the introduction(importation, interstate movement, and release into the environment) ofgenetically engineered organisms and products which are plant pests orwhich there is reason to believe are plant pests (regulated articles).The rule sets forth procedures for obtaining a permit for the release intothe environment of a regulated article and for obtaining limited permitsfor the importation or interstate movement of a regulated article. A permitmust be obtained before a regulated article can be introduced in the UnitedStates.APHIS has stated that it would prepare environmental assessments and, wherenecessary, environmental impact statements prior to issuing a permit forthe release into the environment of a regulated article (see 52 FR 22906).The Sandoz Crop Protection Corporation of Des Plaines, Illinois, has submittedan application for a permit for release into the environment of geneticallyengineered tobacco plants that are designed to be tolerant to sulfonylureaherbicides. In the course of reviewing the permit application, APHIS assessedthe impact of the environment of releasing the tobacco plants under theconditions described in the Sandoz application. APHIS concluded that thefield testing will not present a risk of plant pest introduction or disseminationand will also not have any significant impact on the quality of the humanenvironment.The environment assessment and finding of no significant impact which isbased on data submitted by the Sandoz Crop Protection Corporation, as wellas a review of other relevant literature, provides the public with documentationof APHIS' review and analysis of the environmental impacts associated withconducting the field testing.The facts supporting APHIS' finding of no significant impact are summarizedbelow and are contained in the environmental assessment.1. A gene which has the effect of making tobacco plants tolerant to theeffect of sulfonylurea herbicides has been inserted into a tobacco chromosome.In nature, the genetic material contained in a chromosome can only be transferredto another sexually compatible plant by cross-pollination. In this fieldtest, the introduced gene cannot spread to any other sexually compatibleplant by cross-pollination for the following reasons: (1) No pollen willbe produced because upon initiation of flowering the panicle (sexual parts)of each plant, will be removed; and (2) the field test plot is locatedat a sufficient distance from any sexually compatible plant with whichthese experimental tobacco plants could successful cross-pollinate.2. Neither the acetolactate synthase (ALS) gene itself, nor its derivedgene product confers on toacco any plant pest characteristic. Traits suchas weediness are polygenic and cannot be conferred by adding a single herbicidetolerance gene. The experimental tobacco plants remain sensitive to a widerange of other herbicides which could be used to kill these plants. 3. The tobacco variety from which the ALS gene was obtained is not a plantpest. 4. The ALS gene does not provide the genetically engineered tobacco plantswith any measurable selective advantage over nongenetically engineeredtobacco plants in their ability to be disseminated or to become establishedin the environment. 5. The vector used to transfer the ALS gene into a tobacco chromosome hasbeen evaluated for its use in this experiment. The vector, although derivedfrom an original wild-type Ti plasmid with known plant pathogenic potential,has been disarmed; that is, phytohormone genes which are necessary to conferplant pathogenic traits have been removed from the vector. The vector hasbeen tested and shown to be not pathogenic to any susceptible plant. 6. The vector agent, the phytopathogenic bacterium which was used to deliverthe vector encoding the ALS gene into a tobacco plant cell, has been demonstratedby <T3>in vitro </T3>and <T3>in vivo </T3>assays to be eliminated and no longer associated withany genetically engineered tobacco plant or seed. 7. Horizontal movement by infectious transfer or transposition of any ofthe introduced genes or DNA sequences is not known to be possible. Thevector acts by delivering the gene to the tobacco genome where it is stablyinserted into the tobacco chromosomal DNA. The vector cannot replicateindependently of its vector agent and does not survive alone in any plant.No mechanism of horizontal movement is known to exist in nature to movean inserted gene from a chromosome of a genetically engineered plant toany other organism. 8. Sulfonylurea herbicides are a new class of herbicides noted for theirhigh herbicidal activity at very low use rates, excellent crop selectivity,and low mammalian toxicity. 9. The size of the enclosed field test plot is small (no more than 35,685square feet). The plot is located on a private research farm and will havegood security. The experimental plot is located away from any major villageor road. The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact has beenprepared in accordance with (1) the National Environmental Policy Act of1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321 <T3>et seq.</T3>); (2) Regulations of the Council on Environmental Qualityfor Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (Title 40, Code of FederalRegulations (CFR) Parts 1500-1508); (3) USDA Regulations Implementing NEPA(7 CFR Part 1b); and (4) APHIS Guidelines Implementing NEPA (44 FR 50381-50384and 44 FR 51272-51274).<ITAG tagnum="21">Done at Washington, DC, this 31st day of May, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Larry B.
