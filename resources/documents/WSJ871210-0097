Lured by the explosive sales of fragrances like &quot;Giorgio&quot; and Calvin Klein's &quot;Obsession,&quot; a swarm of celebrities, retailers and even gambling casinos are jumping into the women's perfume market. In the process, the hype has become as heavy as some of the scents: Magazines reek with an ever-growing number of perfumed ads; displays in department stores include live dancers and forests of ficus trees; even Elizabeth Taylor hits the road to promote her potion.    The hoopla reflects the high cost of success in the now-glutted market. To secure and hold a spot on crowded perfume shelves, new contenders have to spend more on flashier advertisements and promotions and become a hit almost immediately.    &quot;The biggest entry making the biggest noise in the most correct fashion is often the winner,&quot; says Onute Miller, the women's fragrance buyer for Bloomingdale's department stores, a popular launching pad for new fragrances. &quot;You can no longer take a gorgeous bottle with a beautiful fragrance and a name and just put it on the counter.&quot;    So some are laying it on thick. When Parfums International, a unit of Unilever Group, introduced Elizabeth Taylor's &quot;Passion,&quot; it sent Ms. Taylor to department stores in nine cities to sign perfume bottles and have tea with select shoppers. Television spots in the $10 million marketing effort show Ms. Taylor reading poems about passion while wearing a low-cut purple evening dress. &quot;Passion, I see, is catching,&quot; she coos, quoting William Shakespeare.    (Perhaps too catching. The Unilever unit was sued for trademark infringement by Annick Goutal Inc., which makes its own &quot;Passion&quot; fragrance. A New York judge recently ruled that Ms. Taylor's perfume should be banned from &quot;first-tier&quot; department stores and left it to the two sides to identify those stores.)    Although manufacturers are generally tight-lipped about sales and marketing figures, Product Marketing, an industry trade publication, says perfume sales totaled $2.96 billion in 1986, a 1% drop from 1985 and the first drop in four years. The change reflects the glut of products on the market, analysts say. According to Fragrance Foundation, an industry research arm, 525 women's perfumes are now on store shelves, a jump of 130 brands in the past four years.    Still, the potential for huge profits continues to attract manufacturers. Many fragrances selling for $100 to $300 an ounce contain ingredients costing as little as $2.50 an ounce, according to industry analysts. And there are dramatic success stories. &quot;Giorgio,&quot; for instance, a fragrance produced by the Beverly Hills clothing shop of the same name, had sales of $100 million last year after five years on the market.    Industry hype picked up in 1985 after Calvin Klein spent a reported $17 million to introduce the highly successful &quot;Obsession&quot; fragrance with an advertising campaign featuring a lot of naked bodies. Many manufacturers say they now spend $10 million and up on promotions. Much of that goes to department stores, which often charge scent makers for window displays, sales people, models who spray shoppers, and eye-catching decorations.    Efforts to top rivals' promotions mean that department-store shoppers are increasingly confronted by drama in the aisles. In June, for instance, Suzanne de Lyon, a Houston-based importer, unveiled a fragrance called &quot;Animale&quot; at Bloomingdale's in New York with a roar. Cast members from the Broadway musical &quot;Cats&quot; were recruited to dance in the aisles, while models wearing body suits painted with zebra-like stripes posed in the store's windows and struck frozen poses on indoor steps.    Ms. de Lyon also commissioned ads showing a naked woman painted with zebra stripes. The makeup took 16 hours to apply. &quot;Like any other perfume, it has to be shocking,&quot; explains Ms. de Lyon. &quot;Animale,&quot; which sells for $200 an ounce, has raked in $6.2 million in sales since June -- still well below its marketing costs.    The marketers don't stop at dancing in the aisles. When Elizabeth Arden Inc. introduced &quot;Fendi&quot; in Bloomingdale's last February, the company dragged in about 35 ficus trees, each sporting Fendi samples. A big chunk of the carpet was changed to bear a Fendi logo. Replicas of Roman statues were brought in. And who should fly in from Rome to sign shopping bags? The five Fendi sisters, owners of the Italian fur company that licensed the rights for the fragrance.    The point of all this? &quot;The concept was total impact,&quot; explains Joseph F. Ronchetti, president of Elizabeth Arden. &quot;Nothing is more competitive than Bloomingdale's, where everyone is spending disproportionally,&quot; he adds.    A raft of retailers have launched their own fragrances this year, including &quot;Tiffany&quot; from the New York jewelry store, and &quot;Bijan,&quot; from a men's store in Beverly Hills. Then there's Herbert Fink, another Beverly Hills merchant who plans to launch his own perfume in February. No, the fragrance won't be called &quot;Herbert Fink&quot;; he plans to call it &quot;Spoiled.&quot;    Even Caesars World, which operates hotels and gambling casinos, has developed its own fragrances: Caesars Woman and Caesars Man. Unveiled at a gala bash in Las Vegas last weekend, the fragrances were wheeled in on Roman-style chariots led by hired hands dressed as gladiators, Roman soldiers and Roman goddesses.    Caesars World had hoped to release 25 doves whose wings had been dipped in the perfume -- a technique the company says was used by the Romans to freshen the air. But the fragrant fowls refused to fly. Says James Roth, the consultant who worked on the scent: &quot;They weren't in the mood.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
