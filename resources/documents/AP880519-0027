BIGELOW</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A petition organized by a Christian humanrights group asks a Shiite Moslem religious leader in Beirut tointercede on behalf of Westerners being held hostage in Lebanon, aformer captive said Wednesday.   The prayerful plea, with 40,000 signatures, was carried out ofthe United States this week and is expected to be delivered thisweekend to Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah in Beirut, said DavidJacobsen, who spent 17 months in captivity.   The wording of the petition was carefully worked out inconsultation with Shiite religious leaders, Jacobsen said in atelephone interview at his home in Huntington Beach, 32 miles southof Los Angeles.   Reading from a copy of the petition, Jacobsen said it reads:``In the name of one merciful God, we the undersigned wish toexpress to you our concern and prayers for the hostages heldcaptive in Lebanon.   ``We also pray for the countless Lebanese held captive inLebanon and elsewhere in the Middle East.   ``As believers in almighty God we have faith that prayer is morepowerful than armies or contingents of diplomats. Because of thiswe respectfully ask you to pray with us and to do whatever you canto intercede on behalf of all these hostages and captives.'''   Fadlallah is a Shiite Moslem religious leader associated withthe Hezbollah, or the Party of God,   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah is the group believed responsiblefor the kidnapping of Americans, British and other Westerners inLebanon.   ``What makes this so very important is that a story came outTuesday in which Sheik Fadlallah said the only way the hostages canbe released is through direct talks with the abductors,'' Jacobsensaid.   It is hoped that Fadlallah can facilitate those talks, Jacobsensaid.   A total of 18 Westerners are being held in Lebanon, includingnine Americans. Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent forThe Associated Press, has been held captive longest. He waskidnapped on March 16, 1985.   Jacobsen, 57, was released by his captors in Beirut on Nov. 2,1986, after being held for 17 months. He was working as thehospital administrator at the American University Hospital inBeirut when he was seized on May 28, 1985.   Jacobsen said the petition specifically asks Fadlallah to ``joinus in prayer'' for the safe return home of Anglican church envoyTerry Waite, who was taken hostage last year while trying tonegotiate the release of other Western captives.   The petition concludes, ``We share with you the desire to seeall people safe and at peace, and we agree with your statement,`Neither Islam nor Christianity justify kidnapping.'''   The petition was organized by Friends in the West, a smallProtestant group based in Seattle, Wash., that has worked quietly,but tirelessly for the release of the hostages since 1986, Jacobsensaid.   Jacobsen asked that the leader of Friends in the West not benamed, saying it may endanger his life, or his freedom, in furtherefforts to free the hostages.</TEXT></DOC>
