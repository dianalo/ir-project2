But the first hurricane of the 1988 Atlantic season beganweakening shortly after hitting the coast and was downgraded to atropical storm.   The National Weather Service in Mexico City said Debby movedinland at Tuxpan, a city of 120,000 about 165 miles northeast ofMexico City, at 4 p.m. (6 p.m. EDT). It said at that time the stormwas carrying winds up to 74 mph, the minimum strength to beclassified as a hurricane.   The service downgraded Debby to tropical-storm status after itscenter stalled on reaching the eastern Sierra Madre mountain range50 miles inland about 7:30 p.m., with maximum winds of 49 mph.Heavy rains were falling in parts of Veracruz and Tamaulipas states.   ``We can say the storm is becoming disorganized,'' a weatherservice spokesman said. ``By morning maximum winds should be around30 mph and the storm should disappear by Saturday night.''   The storm caused power outages in Tuxpan and Poza Rica, about 20miles to the south, and dozens of people were evacuated fromlow-lying areas in the two cities and near the Tuxpan and Tecolutlarivers.   ``The rains have calmed somewhat, but the winds are strong,''said Red Cross worker Francisco Javier Cruz Balderas. ``Manystreets are inundated, and the rivers are rising fast.''   Hundreds of people sought refuge in schools and municipaloffices in Alamo, a coffee-producing town about 20 miles west ofTuxpan, said Roberto Martinez, editor of the newspaper El Mundo ofTampico.   Dozens of residents had to be rescued from cars and floodedhomes in Poza Rica, a city of 300,000. Authorities closed streetsin some sections of the city because of flooding.   ``The situation is bad enough, but not desperate,'' said RedCross spokesman Alan Garcia in Poza Rica.   ``A lot of trash in the streets and tree trunks are blockingrunoff,'' he said. ``Even we can't get out _ we're trapped.''   He said several dozen residents of low-lying areas in the citywere evacuated to higher ground but he couldn't give a figure as tohow many people were affected.   Martinez said there were power outages throughout the northernVeracruz coastline and that some local roads were cut off byflooding. Residents of Tampico and other cities in southernTamaulipas state were bracing for heavy rains, he said.   ``There was a lot of panic buying in supermarkets here, but sofar there haven't been any problems,'' Martinez said.   Guadalupe Lopez, a spokeswoman with the Veracruz stategovernment in Jalapa, said she could provide no figures on how manypeople were affected by the storm and that officials had noestimate of damages. There were no reports of deaths or injuries,she said.   Although the national weather services in Miami and Mexico Citysaid Debby was carrying winds of 74 mph, the Mexican navy stationand port authority in Tuxpan said it did not have hurricanestrength.   Navy Capt. Domingo Rojas Cadenas said his reports showed Debbycarrying winds of 50 mph and gusts of up to 62 mph when it reachedTuxpan. ``There is heavy rain now'' he said late Friday, but thestorm had not caused any major problems.   Debby grew from a depression into a tropical storm early Fridayand then quickly gathered strength, becoming a hurricane byafternoon when it was just off the coast.   It was the first hurricane of the 1988 Atlantic hurricane seasonand the fourth named storm.</TEXT></DOC>
