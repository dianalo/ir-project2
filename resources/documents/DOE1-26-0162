A reservoir simulator was developed to solvegas-water reservoir problems where the gas may be treated as a two-componentmiscible mixture. The simulator is based on a modification of SSI's standard3-phase, 3-dimensional reservoir simulator and, therefore, it encompassesthe experience of more than 20 years of simulation technology. To accomplishthe task, the oil equation was removed and a means of tracking a secondcomponent (inert) in the gas phase was added. The movement of the inertcomponent was described with the method of characteristics to practicallyeliminate the numerical dispersion problems associated with the solutionof the flow equations with standard finite-difference methods.</TEXT></DOC>
