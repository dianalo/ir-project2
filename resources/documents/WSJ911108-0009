If you said true, you're wrong. CFCs have been banned inthe U.S. from almost all aerosol consumer products since1978. But you have plenty of company. Only 14% of Americansanswered correctly in a Roper survey being released todaythat was commissioned by S.C. Johnson andamp; Son Inc., Racine,Wis.</LP><TEXT>   The survey measured the nation's knowledge ofenvironmental issues, or its Green Point Average. Overall,Americans flunked, scoring only a 33 GPA out of a possible100. The quiz, conducted by Roper Organization, consisted offive true-false and five multiple choice questions aboutland, air and water. It was given in July to 2,000 Americansage 18 and over.   The quiz builds on a July 1990 Roper survey onenvironmental priorities that found the public most concernedabout such problems as water pollution from manufacturingplants, oil spills, hazardous waste and industrial airpollution. By contrast, a report by the EnvironmentalProtection Agency ranked oil spills and ground-waterpollution as &quot;relatively low-risk problems,&quot; and namedhigh-risk problems such as global climate change andozone-layer depletion.   The poor showing in the latest survey comes as other pollsshow concern about the environment at an all-time high:Record numbers of Americans claim to be environmentalists.&quot;While we want to do what is environmentally right, itappears we Americans don't always know what that is,&quot; saidRichard Carpenter, president of Johnson, which makes suchhome-care products as Pledge and Glade.   On the CFC question, 55% incorrectly believed that theU.S. government allows most aerosol products to contain CFCs,with 31% saying they didn't know. In reality, most CFCsproduced in the U.S. today are used in filler material infoam products, in refrigeration and vehicle air conditioning.Under an international agreement, industrial nations arerequired to halt all production of CFCs by 2,000, and manyusers and producers are pushing for an even faster requiredphase-out.   The question drawing the least number of correct responsesdealt with motor oil. Only 10% of those surveyed knew thatthe amount of used motor oil dumped by car owners into drainsand sewers each year is more than 10 times as much as the 10million to 11 million gallons spilled off the coast of Alaskaby the Exxon Valdez in March 1989. Twenty-six percent saidthe amount dumped is about half as big as the Valdez spill;17% said it is less than one-tenth of Valdez; 17% said it istwice as much, and 30% pleaded ignorance.   The best response came on a true-false question involvingrain forests. Over half, 53%, knew that about 50% of theworld's wild, plant, animal and insect species live in rainforests. Of the rest, 15% incorrectly said the statement wasfalse and 32% didn't know.   In the 1990 survey, Roper divided up Americans into fivecategories based on their environmental commitment. Thisyear, it showed how people falling into the variouscategories fared on the quiz.   Scoring highest were the &quot;True-Blue Greens,&quot; people whorecycle regularly, look for environmentally responsibleproducts and speak out about environmental issues. Even they,however, merely earned a 40 GPA, just a few points above theaverage American's 33 and hardly a passing grade. The leastenvironmentally sensitive group, the &quot;Basic Browns&quot; who haveno interest in protecting the environment, scored a 27.   In response to the other questions, the survey found that:   -- Just 15% of the public knew that steel was the mostwidely recycled material in the U.S. last year. On amultiple-choice question, paper was selected by 46%, plasticsby 18% and glass by 11%. Ten percent volunteered that theydidn't know. In an analysis of the responses, however, Ropernoted that paper and paperboard are the most recycled ofitems typically found in municipal trash.   -- Thirty-six percent of those surveyed correctly saidthat paper and paperboard are the top source of trashdisposed of in landfills, while 35% picked plastics, 10% saidmetals, 7% said food scraps and 12% didn't know.   -- One quarter of Americans correctly picked fish in NewEngland streams as most affected by acid rain when given alist of potentially damaged items. Of the rest, 30% choseCentral American rain forests, 6% said Midwest schoolchildren, 2% selected Black bears in the Smoky Mountains and37% didn't know.   -- Less than half of the public, 42%, knew that most ofthe biodegradable packaging thrown way doesn't decomposewithin 10 years. A sizable number, 32%, incorrectly calledthis statement true; 26% didn't know.   -- Forty-three percent of Americans correctly said falsein response to the statement that the installation of modernsewer systems has eliminated the pollution of drinking waterby human wastes, with 32% saying true and 25% saying theydidn't know.   -- Despite considerable media attention to concerns aboutglobal warming, most Americans didn't know that theworld-wide average temperature for 1990 was the warmest onrecord. This statement was correctly pegged as true by 45%,with 19% incorrectly labeling it false and 36% pleadingignorance.   -- Over half of the public, 51%, correctly listed the lossof wilderness habitat as the primary reason that populationsof American ducks and geese have been declining over the pastdecade. Responding incorrectly were 20% who cited airpollution, 7% who picked parasites and diseases and 6% whosaid hunters. Fifteen percent said they didn't know.</TEXT></DOC>
