It is found that the spectra are somewhat flatterin the Orion arm than in the interarm region. The significance of theresult is that the parent protons and electrons (of low energy) probablygain significant amounts of energy from processes associated with spiralarms. Supernova remnants are prime candidates both by virtue of one-offacceleration in strong shocks and repeated ('distributed') accelerationby a multitude of weak shocks. Radio synchrotron radiation is also examined,from the standpoint of acceleration processes for high-energy cosmic-rayelectrons. Evidence for spiral arm effects is more difficult to findbut spectral variations in the Galaxy do occur and these may also bedue to supernova remnants.</TEXT></DOC>
