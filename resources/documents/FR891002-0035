The former was known historically from the ConnecticutRiver in New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Connecticut, and from along theChesapeake Bay in Maryland; it is now restricted to Maryland and one sitein Massachusetts. The latter once occurred commonly along coastal beachesfrom Cape Cod Massachusetts, to central New Jersey and along the ChesapeakeBay, from Calvert County, Maryland, south; it is now evidently extirpatednorth of Maryland. Both tiger beetles are threatened by rapid human populationincrease and development in the areas they occupy. Population and rangereductions undergone by both make them more prone to chance extinctions;more vulnerable to the effects of winter storms, predators, and parasites;and less able to recolonize areas previously occupied. This proposal, ifmade final, will implement protection provided by the Endangered SpeciesAct of 1973, as amended, for these beetles.

Tiger beetle larvae, which live in permanent burrows in theground, are also voracious predators, fastening themselves by means ofabdominal hooks near the tops of the burrows and rapidly extending fromtheir burrows to seize passing invertebrate prey. Over 100 species andmany additional subspecies of tiger beetles occur in the United States(Boyd 1982). Because of their interesting behavior and variety of formsand habitats, tiger beetles have received much study; a journal devotedexclusively to these beetles, ``Cicindela,'' has been published since 1969.The Puritan tiger beetle (<T3>Cicindela puritana</T3>) and the northeastern beach tiger beetle (<T3>Cicindela dorsalis dorsalis</T3>), both associated with beach habitats,have until recently received little ecological study.The Puritan tiger beetle is brownish-bronze above with a metallic blueunderside and measures under 11.5 mm (\1/2\-inch) in total length. Eacheleytron (wing cover) is marked with narrow marginal and transverse whitebands. It is distinguished from more common, similarly marked tiger beetlesby the uneven or minutely broken edges of the middle band (Glaser 1984).Originally described by G. Horn (1876), <T3>C. puritana </T3>was later considered a subspecies of <T3>Cicindela cuprascens</T3> (Leng 1902, Horn 1930) and a subspecies of<T3>Cicindela macra</T3> (Vaurie 1951). Most recently, Willis (1967) establishedseparate species status for these three taxa. The range of <T3>C. puritana</T3> is separated by several hundred miles from the overlappingranges of <T3>C. macra </T3>and <T3>C. cuprascens</T3>.Historically, the Puritan tiger beetle occurred in scattered localitiesalong the Connecticut River in Connecticut, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts,and along the Chesapeake Bay in Calvert and Kent Counties, Maryland. Thereasons for this disjunct distribution are unknown. However, its habitatin both areas is similar, characterized by the presence of narrow sandybeaches with adjacent, well-developed bluffs of sand and clay (Glaser 1984,Knisley 1987). The Puritan tiger beetle has a full one-year life cycle.In Maryland, adults are first seen in mid-June. Their numbers peak in earlyJuly and begin to wane by late July. Collection records from New Englandindicate a pattern similar but shifted about two weeks later (Knisley 1987).The newly emerged beetles feed and mate along the beach area. After mating,females move up onto the cliffs to deposit their eggs. Emerging larvaeconstruct burrows in the cliffs. Knisley found larval burrows in moistareas of sandy clay cliffs adjacent to the beaches where the adults werefound and along the back areas of these beaches. Statistical analysis ofhabitat features indicated that the presence of well-developed, sparselyvegetated cliffs as oviposition (egg-laying) sites is more important forthis beetle than is the quality of adjacent beaches (Knisley 1987).Most New England collection records for the Puritan tiger beetle were fromthe period 1900 to 1920, with the most recent collection in 1939 (Knisley1987). Subsequent vigorous collection attempts were unsuccessful, leadingto the belief that the Puritan tiger beetle was likely extirpated in NewEngland. In July of 1986, however, a population of the Puritan tiger beetlewas discovered in Hampshire County, Massachusetts, on a small island inthe Connecticut River and on a sandy beach several hundred meters to thesouth. No other Connecticut River populations have since been discovered,despite intensive search (Knisley 1987, Nothnagel 1987). The decline ofthis species in New England is most likely due to habitat destruction,particularly of larval habitat. This is further discussed under FactorA below.South of New England, the Puritan tiger beetle is restricted to a 26-milestretch of the Chesapeake Bay in Calvert County and a recently discoveredpopulation in Kent County, Maryland. Status survey work in Calvert Countyduring the breeding season, when adults are active, conducted in 1985 and1986 by B. Knisley (1987), revealed five large populations (600+ individuals)and four small populations (100 or fewer individuals). However, great fluctuationsin numbers may occur from year to year. Tiger beetle populations in CalvertCounty are potentially threatened by human encroachment into their habitat,as detailed below.The northeastern beach tiger beetle (<T3>Cicindela dorsalis dorsalis</T3>), described as <T3>C. dorsalis</T3> by Say (1817), has white to light tan elytra, oftenwith fine dark lines, and a bronze-green head and thorax. It is somewhatlarger than the Puritan tiger beetle, measuring 13 to 15.5mm (\1/2\ to\3/5\ inch) in total length.Cazier (1954) considered <T3>C. dorsalis</T3> and three other previously described species as subspeciesof the single species <T3>C. dorsalis</T3>. Boyd and Rust (1982) determined that these four taxaare clearly distinguishable. Recent morphological analyses and breedingexperiments indicate that <T3>C. dorsalis</T3> is most likely a full species (B. Knisley, RandolfMacon College, pers. comm. June, 1987). Until this information is published,however, it is most appropriate to continue to refer to this taxon as asubspecies.Historically, the northeastern beach tiger beetle occurred on sandy beachesfrom Cape Cod, Massachusetts south to central New Jersey and along theChesapeake Bay of Maryland and Virginia. Early records indicate the abundanceof this beetle on the northeast coast. Leng (1902) states that it occurred``in great swarms in July'' from Martha's Vineyard south to New Jersey.Boyd (1978) cites many references, mostly from the 19th century, indicatingthe species' abundance in New Jersey. It was also common along the beachesof Rhode Island and Long Island, New York (Knisley 1987).Between 1920 and 1950, the number of collections of the northeastern beachtiger beetle dropped precipitously (Knisley <T3>et al. </T3>1987). Stamatov (1972) noted that northeastern beach tigerbeetles were declining, and had possibly disappeared from New York andNew Jersey. He suggested that this decline might be associated with increasingvehicular traffic along the beaches. He did report the existence of a breedingpopulation at Block Island, Rhode Island. This is the most recent recordof a northeastern beach tiger beetle population north of Maryland. Extensivesurveys and information collected by Knisley (1987) indicate that the northeasternbeach tiger beetle is now extirpated north of Maryland. Furthermore, only19 extent populations are known to exist within the Chesapeake Bay areaof Maryland and Virginia, and eight of these are considered ``marginal''due to low population numbers (Knisley, pers. comm., April, 1989).Unlike the larvae of the Puritan tiger beetle, northeastern beach tigerbeetle larvae occupy burrows directly on the beach, in and above the high-tidezone. Rearing experiments (Stamatov 1972) and field observations by Knisleyindicate these beetles have a full two-year life cycle, over-winteringtwice as larvae, pupating at the bottoms of their burrows and emergingas winged adults during their third summer. Adults emerge from early Junethrough August, with peak abundance in mid-July. Adults forage mostly inthe damp sand of the intertidal zone and apparently scavenge on dead fishand invertebrates for much of their diet (Knisley 1987). Habitat characteristicssignificantly correlated with the presence of northeastern beach tigerbeetles include large beach size (length and width), high degree of exposure(dynamic beaches), fine sand particle size and low human and vehicle activity(Knisley 1987).The northeastern beach and Puritan tiger beetles were first recognizedby the Service in the <T4>Federal Reigster</T4> Notice of Review published on May 22, 1984. Thatnotice, which covered invertebrate wildlife being considered for classificationas endangered or threatened, included these two beetles in Category 2.Category 2 comprises those taxa for which listing is possibly appropriate,but for which existing information is insufficient to support a proposedrule. In response to the publication of this notice, the Service receivedcomments from the American Entomological Society expressing their viewthat the northeastern beach tiger beetle clearly qualified for endangeredstatus, and that the status of the Puritan tiger beetle was questionable.The lack of available biological data on these taxa was also noted. Accordingly,in 1985, the Service contracted with Dr. Barry Knisley to conduct statussurvey work on these two beetles. Dr. Knisley's final report to the Service(Knisley 1987) provides much of the biological basis for this proposedlisting action. The <T4>Federal Register</T4> Notice of Review published on January 6, 1989,included these two beetles in Category 1, indicating that the Service nowpossesses sufficient information to support the appropriateness of proposingto list them.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Factors Affecting the Species</ITAG>Section 4(a)(1) of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 153 <T3>et seq.</T3>) and regulations promulgated to implement the listingprovisions of the Act (50 CFR Part 424) set forth the procedures for addingspecies to the Federal Lists. Species may be determined to be endangeredor threatened due to one or more of the five factors described in Section4(a)(1). These factors and their application to the Puritan tiger beetle(<T3>Cicindela puritana</T3>) and northeastern beach tiger beetle (<T3>Cicindela dorsalis dorsalis</T3>) are as follows:A. <T3>The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailmentof their habitat or range.</T3> Although it was once abundant in New England,the northeastern beach tiger beetle is now extirpated from all of its formerrange north of Maryland. This dramatic range contraction has been attributedprimarily to the impacts of human and vehicle activities on beaches (Stamatov1972, Boyd 1978, Knisley 1987). Northeastern beach tiger beetle larvaeare particularly vulnerable to direct crushing or repeated compaction oftheir burrows by vehicles and heavy human use for two reasons. First, theyoccur in the intertidal zone (as opposed to Puritan tiger beetle larvaewhich burrow on cliffs or back beaches) and are therefore unavoidably inthe path of beach users and their vehicles. Secondly, due to their prolongedlife cycle, these beetles must pass through two summers in their vulnerablelarval stage.The significant impact of vehicles on this beetle is illustrated by a studyof the related <T3>Cicindela dorsalis media,</T3> which Dr. Knisley conducted on AssateagueIsland in 1985. Adults (and larvae) were found only on the northern 2-milesection of the island where vehicles were restricted and human activitylight. No beetles were found on the remaining 10-12 miles of beach, includingthe State Park portion and the southern portion in Maryland where off-roadvehicle activity is heavy. But, just below the state line in Virginia,where vehicles are prohibited, adult beetles could again be found. A studyof the northeastern beach tiger beetle presently underway in Maryland isyielding similar results; the abundance of larval tiger beetles is inverselycorrelated with the amount of human traffic that an area receives (Knisley,pers. comm., 1989). Southern Maryland and coastal Virginia are developingrapidly. Visible signs of development in Calvert County, Maryland are thewidening of Routes 2-4 in the southern part of the county, developmentof a state park at Flag Ponds and creation and expansion of numerous housingdevelopments. A private campground now occurs at one of Virginia's largestbeetle population beaches, and several ``planned community'' developmentshave been proposed near other large populations on the Eastern Shore. Developmentof the Virginia's eastern shore threatens to be so rapid and haphazardthat a citizens' group has been formed to try to bring some order to potentialdevelopment. Such development results in increased human activity on thebeaches, as well as construction of marinas and increased use of bulkheadsand other structures that may eliminate or alter beaches.Pollution and alteration of the intertidal beach areas are also potentialthreats to these beetles. Spills of oil or other pollutants that reachthe shore could be lethal to the tiger beetle larvae directly, or indirectly,by interfering with their feeding behavior or diminishing their prey base.Dredge spoil material placed on beaches could also destroy larvae directly.In contrast to northeastern beach tiger beetles, Puritan tiger beetle larvaeburrow on beachside cliffs and back beaches, where they are less susceptibleto direct impacts of human and vehicular traffic or other perturbationsof intertidal habitat. However, this species has not escaped the effectsof habitat degradation, particularly where it occurred along the ConnecticutRiver. A total of 17 dams have been built along the Connecticut above Hartford,very likely inundating some Puritan tiger beetle populations and decreasingwater flow necessary for habitat maintenance at others. The Connecticuthas also been seriously polluted by effluent from pulp and paper millsand other factories and by inputs of raw sewage (McCarry 1972). Effortsover the past several decades to clean up this river have been largelysuccessful, and may permit reestablishment of tiger beetle populationsin some areas of previous extirpation (Tanner 1988). Cliff stabilizationis another form of habitat alteration affecting the Puritan tiger beetletoday. Continual erosion and breakdown of the cliffs, from wave actionand rainfall, is necessary to create the newly exposed areas needed foroviposition and larval development. Construction of bulkheads and growthof kudzu or other introduced vegetation on cliffs curtails this erosiveprocess and renders the cliffs unsuitable for the larvae. In Massachusetts,bank stabilization and urbanization along the Connecticut River have eliminatedmuch potential tiger beetle habitat (Nothnagel 1987).B. <T3>Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific or educationalpurposes.</T3> It is no exaggeration to state that tiger beetles (genus<T3>Cicindela</T3>) are the most highly sought-after by amateur collectorsof all bettle genera. Additionally, tiger beetles are frequently used asmodel organisms in physiological and ecological studies. In fact the genus<T3>Cicindela</T3> may be the subject of more intense collecting and studythan any other single insect genus. This interest in tiger beetles is reflectedin the publication since 1969 of a journal devoted exclusively to thisgenus.At present, collecting pressure on adult beetles is not believed to becontributing to the decline of these species; threats to larval survivalappear to outweigh any threats to adults. However, the proposed listingsof these beetles as endangered and threatened could increase their desirabilityand perceived value to collectors.C. <T3>Disease or predation.</T3> These tiger beetles are not known to besusceptible to any diseases that would threaten their survival; however,two insects known to be natural enemies have been commonly observed intheir habitat. Adults of the wingless wasp, <T3>Methocha,</T3> were found at several population sites. Female <T3>Methocha</T3> attack and paralyze tiger beetle larvae, then lay a singleegg on the beetle larva, so that their own larva may use the beetle fora food source as it develops. This parasitoid may account for significanttiger beetle mortality. Robber flies (family Asilidae) were also seen commonlyat most sites visited by Knisley (1987). These predatory flies perch andwait for adult tiger beetles or other flying prey and capture them outof the air. Ten unsuccessful attacks of robber flies on northeastern beachtiger beetles were observed during status survey work (Knisley 1987). Normally,these predators and parasitoids, which evolved in conjunction with thetiger beetles, would not pose a severe threat to the survival of theirhost (or prey) species, since this would, in the long run, threaten theirown survival. However, this natural balance has been altered by habitatdegradation, as mentioned in factor A, and now these natural enemies mayin some cases pose significant threats to the beetles' survival.D. <T3>The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms. </T3>The Puritanand northeastern beach tiger beetles are both classified as endangeredunder Maryland state law, and their take is prohibited, except as permittedfor scientific research. While this lends some protection to individualbeetles, it does not adequately protect the larval beetles' habitat. Thesebeetles are not presently protected under Virginia's Endangered Plant andInsect Protection Act, but if they are Federally listed, they will be automaticallyadded to the state list. This law also provides protection from taking,but does not regulate habitat alteration. While both tiger beetles areon the state ``Endangered'' list in Massachusetts, the state EndangeredSpecies Act has not yet been approved by the legislature. However, thebeetles and their habitat are protected in Massachusetts under the WetlandsProtection Act, which requires permit applicants to consider the requirementsof listed species in their project plans.E. <T3>Other natural or man-made factors affecting their continued existence.</T3>Severe flooding may have contributed to the near extinction of the Puritantiger beetle from the Connecticut River system. New England's worst floodsoccurred in 1927 and 1936, at about same the time collection records forthis species became non-existent (Knisley 1987). These intensive floodslikely inundated the adult beetles' beach habitat and/or stripped off portionsof riverside cliffs where the larvae occurred.Populations of both tiger beetle species normally experience very highlarval mortality and dramatic year-to-year variations in abundance andlocal extinctions, due to factors such as flood tides, hurricanes, winterstorms and other natural phenomena. A series of nearby or contiguous populationsis probably necessary to reestablish populations that have been locallydepleted or extirpated. Both decrease in habitat size and number of populationsmake it difficult for beetles to recover from population declines causedby natural or human-related factors. Small habitat size supports a smallerpopulation with a greater probability of extinction. Gradual eliminationor disruption of adjacent habitats eliminates the source of beetles forrecolonization of extirpated population sites. This problem has apparentlybeen more severe from New Jersey to Massachusetts, where climatic conditionsfor the beetles are less favorable and human pressures on habitats greater.The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial informationregarding past, present and future threats faced by these species in determiningto propose this rule. Based on this evaluation, the preferred action isto list the northeastern beach tiger beetle (<T3>Cicindela dorsalis dorsalis</T3>) as endangered and the Puritan tigerbeetle (<T3>Cicindela puritana</T3>) as threatened. The northeastern beach tigerbeetle has been extirpated from a significant portion of its range alongthe northeast coast of the U.S.; its prolonged larval stage and the locationof larvae in the intertidal sands, in the path of human and vehicular traffic,render this beetle very vulnerable to local extinction through habitatdestruction. Threatened status would not accurately reflect the statusof this beetle, whose remaining habitat is undergoing rapid development.This same area is also the stronghold of remaining Puritan tiger beetlehabitat. However, the Puritan tiger beetle appears somewhat less vulnerableto direct habitat disruption because its larval burrows are located inless accessible areas. Furthermore, certain areas along the ConnecticutRiver where this beetle has been extirpated may be suitable for recolonization.Therefore, threatened status seems most appropriate for this species.<ITAG tagnum="84">Critical Habitat</ITAG>Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that to the maximum extentprudent and determinable, the Secretary designate any habitat of a specieswhich is considered to be critical habitat at the time the species is determinedto be endangered or threatened. The Service finds that designation of criticalhabitat is not prudent for these species at this time. As mentioned inFactor B above, tiger beetle specimens are considered very valuable tocollectors. Publication of maps detailing the specific locations of thesebeetles would increase the probability of their being over-collected, especiallyat sites containing smaller populations. Protection for these species andtheir habitats will be addressed through application of the jeopardy standardand through the recovery process. On balance, the threat of over-collectionas a result of designation of critical habitat would outweigh any benefitof such designation. Therefore, it is not prudent to determine criticalhabitat for these beetles at this time.<ITAG tagnum="84">Available Conservation Measures</ITAG>Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatenedunder the Endangered Species Act include recognition, recovery actions,requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices.Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actionsby Federal, State, and private agencies, groups, and individuals. The EndangeredSpecies Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation withthe States and requires recovery actions be carried out for all listedspecies. Such actions are initiated by the Service following listing. Theprotection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions against takingare discussed, in part, below.Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluatetheir actions with respect to any species that is proposed or listed asendangered or threatened. Regulations implementing this interagency cooperationprovision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part 402. Section 7(a)(4) requiresFederal agencies to confer with the Service on any action that is likelyto jeopardize the continued existence of a proposed species. If a speciesis subsequently listed, Section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to ensurethat activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likey to jeopardizethe continued existence of such a species or to destroy or adversely modifyits critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect a listed species orits critical habitat, the responsible Federal agency must enter into formalconsultation with the Service. Private developers who are working withoutany Federal permits other such authorizations or monies, will be unaffectedunder this rule with respect to Section 7(a), but would be subject to restrictionsagainst take, as specified in Section 9 of the Act and implementing regulations.The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) has jurisdiction over much ofthe area inhabited by these tiger beetles. Projects possibly affectingthe beetles would include dredge spoil disposal, beach erosion control,marina construction, and other developments affecting beach areas. OtherFederal agencies that could possibly be affected if these beetles are listedwould include the U.S. Coast Guard, National Marine Fisheries Service,Soil Conservation Service and other agencies conducting or overseeing projectsin coastal areas or along the Connecticut River.At present, the only Federal projects or permitting actions known to theService that could affect these beetles include several minor spoil disposaloperations, a Corps beach stabilization project at Long Beach, Marylandand a proposed campground facility on Virginia's lower eastern shore. TheCorps is aware of this proposed listing and is working with the Serviceto avoid any adverse impacts to the beetles associated with these projects.The listing of these beetles would also bring Sections 5 and 6 of the EndangeredSpecies Act into full effect in their behalf. Section 5 authorizes theacquisition of lands for the purpose of conserving endangered and threatenedspecies. Pursuant to Section 6, the Service would be able to grant fundsto affected states for management actions aiding the protection and recoveryof the beetles.Listing these tiger beetles as threatened and endangered would providefor development of a recovery plan (or plans) for them. Such plan(s) wouldbring together both State and Federal efforts for conservation of the beetles.The plan(s) would establish an administrative framework, sanctioned bythe Act, for agencies to coordinate activities and cooperate with eachother in conservation efforts. The plan(s) would set recovery prioritiesand estimate the cost of various tasks necessary to accomplish them. Theywould assign appropriate functions to each agency and a time frame withinwhich to complete them. They would also identify specific areas that needto be monitored and possibly managed for the beetles.The Act and implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.21 for endangeredspecies and 17.21 and 17.31 for threatened species set forth a series ofgeneral prohibitions and exceptions that apply to all endangered or threatenedwildlife. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for any person subjectto the jurisdiction of the United States to take, import or export, transportin interstate or foreign commerce in the course of commercial activity,or sell or offer for sale in interstate or foreign commerce, any listedspecies. It is also illegal to possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport,or ship any such wildlife that was illegally taken. Certain exceptionscan apply to agents of the Service and State conservation agencies.Permits may be issued to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involvingendangered and threatened animal species under certain circumstances. Regulationsgoverning permits are at 17.22, 17.23, and 17.32. Such permits are availablefor scientific purposes to enhance the propagation or survival of the species,and/or for incidental take in connection with otherwise lawful activities.For threatened species there are also permits for zoological exhibition,educational purposes or other purposes consistent with the purposes ofthe Act. Further information regarding regulations and requirements forpermits may be obtained from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Officeof Management Authority, Permits Branch, P.O. Box 3507 Arlington, VA 22203-3507(703/358-2104).<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comments Solicited</ITAG>The Service intends that any final action resulting from this proposalbe as accurate and effective as possible in the conservation of endangeredor threatened species. Therefore, any comments or suggestions from thepublic, other concerned governmental agencies, the scientific community,industry, private interests, or any other interested party concerning anyaspect of this proposal are hereby solicited. Comments particularly aresought concerning:(1) Biological, commerical or other relevant data concerning any threat(or the lack thereof) to these tiger beetles;(2) The location of any additional populations of Puritan tiger beetlesor northeastern beach tiger beetles and the reasons that any habitat shouldor should not be determined to be critical habitat as provided by Section4 of the Act;(3) Additional information concerning the range and distribution of thesebeetles; and(4) Current or planned activities in the subject areas that may impactthese beetles;Final promulgation of the regulations on these species will take into considerationthe comments and any additional information received by the Service, andsuch communications may lead to adoption of a final regulation that differsfrom this proposal.The Endangered Species Act provides for a public hearing on this proposal,if requested. Requests must be filed within 45 days of the date of theproposal. Such requests must be made in writing (see ADDRESSES section).<ITAG tagnum="84">National Environmental Policy Act</ITAG>The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment,as defined under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Actof 1969, need not be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuantto Section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. A noticeoutlining the Service's reasons for this determination was published inthe <T4>Federal Register</T4> on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244).<ITAG tagnum="84">References Cited</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Boyd, H.
