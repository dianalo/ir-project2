Although business is good again after a deep slump, experts sayrelatively weak oil prices and the Piper Alpha oil rig disaster lastJuly have forced underwater drillers to change the way they dobusiness.   Once concerned about producing oil quickly, the industry now ismore worried about restraining costs, and that has meant many lostjobs, experts said.   The rig disaster, a fire that killed 167 men, halted aconsiderable amount of production _ 300,000 barrels a day for aboutsix months _ and increased safety concerns.   The industry has attracted many competitors with its 22 percentsuccess rate in finding oil despite the technological problemsassociated with underwater drilling.   The rivalry has squeezed profits and encouraged takeovers,leaving a smaller number of companies. The most notable takeover wasBritish Petroleum Co. PLC's $4.4 billion acquisition of Britoil PLCearly last year.   Adding to concerns is an awareness that the oil won't lastforever and Norway's sector of the North Sea is expected to surpassBritish production in a few years.   Some companies have moved to protect themselves by getting moreheavily into gas exploration and production, selling their expertiseabroad and broadening into defense and other non-oil areas.   ``It's a different business we're in,'' said Ian Wood, head ofJohn Wood Group PLC, a Scottish oil-services company.   ``The super-boom is gone. The '86-'87 downturn was a watershed.The emphasis now is on cost.''   Britain is the non-communist world's sixth largest oil producerafter Saudi Arabia, the United States, Mexico, Iran and Iraq,figures compiled by the Royal Bank of Scotland show.   Thirty-six fields produced about 2.41 million barrels a day lastyear, down 7.5 percent from the 1985 peak of 2.59 million barrels aday.   Production is expected to decline to 2.22 million barrels a daythis year, 2 million by 1995, and expire in 30 to 50 years. NorthSea oil was first produced in significant amounts in 1976.   It is Scotland's largest single industry with 54,000 workers,down 18 percent from 1985 but 6 percent higher than during theslump, the bank said.   ``Currently, I think business is very, very good,'' said DerekMarnoch, chief executive of the Aberdeen Chamber of Commerce.   Oil prices plummeted from $30 a barrel to $10 a barrel in early1986, and have recovered to about $19.   ``The oil price shock came as quite a devastating blow in theindustry,'' said James Walker, an economist at the Royal Bank ofScotland. ``Since then companies have moved on to a new expectationabout oil prices and the potential of the North Sea and have actedaccordingly.''   Recently, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries hascurbed production to bolster prices, and independent producingcountries have announced they are trimming exports.   Britain belongs neither to OPEC nor the independent group, butNorth Sea oil production is vulnerable to OPEC's erratic behavior.   The North Sea oil industry has cut costs by reducing manpower,upgrading technology and undertaking smaller projects, Walker said.   Still, it's more expensive to produce oil in the poor North Seaconditions, $3 to $15 a barrel, vs. less than $1 a barrel in theMiddle East, Walker said.   Despite declining production and weak prices, experts said oilexploration remains healthy.   Industry enthusiasm was reflected in good demand for explorationleases in the government's recent sale.   Last year was a record year for drilling, with 21 new fieldsbegun, said Angus Nicolson, a Scottish Development Agency official.   ``Ultimately we are looking at finite resources,'' said IanHenderson, deputy managing director of Shell U.K. Exploration andProduction. ``The challenge now is to find the smaller and smalleramounts and produce them cleverly.''   Even after cutting costs, however, it's difficult to make aprofit, the experts said. ``There are the usual complaints that themargins are thin,'' Marnoch said.   Indeed, Henderson conceded that his company's net income haseroded, but he declined to elaborate.   The Piper Alpha rig, operated by Occidental Petroleum Corp., wasowned by Occidental and other oil companies, and Shell was notdirectly involved in the disaster. But upgrading safety hasincreased its costs, Henderson said.   A public inquiry into the disaster might result inrecommendations for costly safety measures. For example, thegovernment already has asked the industry to comment on thepossibility of requiring all operators to install emergency shutdownvalves.   End adv for Sunday, March 26</TEXT></DOC>
