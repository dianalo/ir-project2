SEC staff economist Lori Price said she used filings with the commission to compile data on the sources of financing for about 150 successful takeovers launched in the 12 months ended last June. She emphasized that her data is preliminary, and doesn't yet include figures for 12 takeovers, including Campeau Corp.'s $6.6 billion acquisition last May of Federated Department Stores Inc.    The financing used in the 150 takeovers amounts to about $52 billion, Ms. Price said. Of that, bridge loans -- short-term loans extended by Wall Street firms or banks to enable an acquirer to complete a transaction before permanent financing is arranged -- accounted for $6.36 billion, or about one in every eight dollars used in takeovers.    Long-term borrowing from banks amounted to $26.5 billion, or just over half the total, Ms. Price said. Comparative data from previous years isn't available, but generally speaking, &quot;bank borrowing seems to stay the same, but bridge loans seem to be increasing,&quot; she said. Ms. Price declined to discuss the study's policy implications.    The growth of bridge loans, which primarily have been extended by Wall Street firms, worries many in the securities industry. They fear investment banks, which have relatively less capital than commercial banks, are risking big chunks of their capital in transactions that could come apart. Some say Wall Street's growing exposure could prove troublesome if some companies that have been taken over collapse in a recession.    But Dominic Casserly, a McKinsey andamp; Co. consultant who frequently advises financial institutions, dismissed that concern. &quot;Sure, these investment banks are taking a lot of risks,&quot; he said. &quot;But it's important to remember they're being richly rewarded for it&quot; because they're charging unusually high rates of interest, he added.    Mr. Casserly said the increase in bridge loans primarily reflects the reduced opportunities Wall Street firms perceive in their older lines of business, such as stock and bond underwriting.    Debt financing accounted for $5.39 billion, or 10% of the total takeover financing, Ms. Price said, while equity financing totaled $5.27 billion, or another 10%. The remaining 16% of takeover financing -- $8.54 billion -- came from internal funds of the buyers, she said.    Harvard economist Benjamin Friedman said, &quot;What stands out to me (about the SEC study) is that it is correct that these transactions are substantially increasing the leveraging of corporate America.&quot;    When the percentages for bank borrowings, bridge loans, and debt issues are combined, Prof. Friedman added, they indicate that takeover financing has a debt-to-equity ratio of 3-to-1, which he called &quot;an awfully high ratio by the standards of American business.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
