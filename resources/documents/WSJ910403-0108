The January 1990 crash occurred when the right wing of anEastern Boeing 727 slammed into a Beechcraft Kingair-100,killing the pilot of the small plane. The Eastern pilots saidthey saw the Kingair just three seconds before hitting it.None of the 157 people aboard the Eastern jet was killed.</LP><TEXT>   The National Transportation Safety Board, in issuing itsfinal report on the accident, said the controller waspreoccupied at the time of the accident with a ContinentalAirlines plane that had landed but was having troubleunderstanding ground directions.   The controller and the pilot apparently were both tryingto talk on the same frequency at the same time, which garbledthe communications. As the controller focused on thatsituation, the Kingair and the Eastern plane, which both hadbeen cleared, landed in rapid succession. The controller toldinvestigators that he thought the small plane had left therunway by the time the Eastern plane touched down.   The board said that the probable cause of the accident wasthe failure of the controller to &quot;ensure the separation ofarriving aircraft, which were using the same runway.&quot;According to the board, two additional factors contributed tothe accident: The failure of the controller to issue trafficinformation to the Eastern plane about the Kingair and thefailure of the same controller and a second controller toorder the Eastern plane to slow down so it wouldn't be soclose to the Kingair.   The board's conclusions came as the Federal AviationAdministration and its controller work force face increasingscrutiny in the wake of a string of fatal runway crashes.   A runway collision in Detroit last December involving twoNorthwest Airlines jets claimed eight lives, and a Februarycrash involving a USAir jet and a commuter plane in LosAngeles killed 34 people. Questions have been raised aboutthe controllers' actions in both cases, and the accidents areunder investigation by the safety board.   In the Los Angeles accident, a controller apparentlycleared a USAir jet to land on a runway without realizingthat a commuter plane was on the same runway, waiting forpermission to take off. In the Detroit accident, the pilotsof a Northwest jet apparently got lost in a dense fog andwandered on to an active runway, where they were hit by aplane taking off.   At a recent hearing, the Detroit controller was asked whyhe didn't stop the takeoff once he realized another plane waslost. He said he thought the plane he was directing wasalready airborne.   But while the conduct and judgment of controllers is beingexamined, aviation experts are becoming increasinglyconvinced that the aviation system needs increased safeguardsto prevent a controller mistake from resulting in tragedy.   In discussing the Atlanta crash, John Lauber, a member ofthe NTSB, said, &quot;People make mistakes from time to time, andwe obviously haven't designed the system to accommodate it.&quot;Unless the system is improved, he warned, &quot;we're going tocontinue to have these kind of accidents.&quot;   The safety board, in response to the accident, recommendedthat the FAA provide a brief explanation in the controllers'handbook on the importance of providing pilots with trafficinformation about other planes.   It also recommended that the agency speed efforts todevelop and deploy devices that would alert a controller toimpending runway collisions. Such equipment is beingdeveloped but probably won't be deployed extensively foryears.</TEXT></DOC>
