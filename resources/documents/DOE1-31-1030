The outcome of this project, entitled advanced SO{sub 2}Control Waste Management, will be technical guidelines that can be usedin the design and operation of waste management systems for advancedSO{sub 2} control processes. This document describes the informationand methods that are needed to collect and analyze samples for this project.It includes general sampling approaches that are common to all wastestypes for the project and generic sampling plans. It also includes acharacterization test matrix and flow chart, justification of analysesand tests, descriptions of analyses and tests, data management procedures,and data quality evaluation criteria and requirements. 36 refs., 10 figs.,11 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
