The four systems record large amounts of data, as well as images. Kodak said the market for such systems currently is tiny, but that it expects the market to reach $60 billion annually by 1995.    Kodak said its system with the highest capacity, the 6800, uses a 14-inch optical disk capable of storing as many as one trillion bytes of data, which can be retrieved within 12 seconds or less. The 14-inch disk holds three to four times as much information as the 12-inch disk -- the largest disk currently in commercial use.    The 6800 system won't be available until 1988. At that time it will be marketed through computer companies and manufacturers that will integrate their equipment with Kodak's, the company said. No price was given.    Analysts, while pleased with the storage capability of the disk, said they would have been more impressed had it been made available immediately, considering the extreme competition in the memory and storage industry.    Unlike the 6800 system, which is mainly a storage device, the other three Kodak systems are designed for end-users to address specific business problems.    Basically, the systems are computers that capture, store, manipulate and deliver images -- such as signatures or seals -- as well as letters and numbers. Kodak said potential buyers would be insurance and financial companies, or any business heavily involved in handling paper documents.    The high-end of the three, the KIMS 5000, uses either a 12-inch optical disk or microfilm, the more common medium now being used to store documents. Storing documents on optical disks is two to five times more expensive than microfilm, but the optical disk is faster, Kodak said. This system will cost about $700,000.    The KIMS 4500, is microfilm-based, while the third system, the KIMS 3000, uses manually loaded optical disks. The less-sophisticated KIMS 3000 is tailored for small businesses or users. These two systems will cost about $150,000 each.    All three KIMS systems will be available in mid-1987. Kodak said that both the KIMS 4500 and the 3000 can be upgraded, and that the 14-inch disk may be an option for the KIMS 5000 in the future. The computer for the KIMS workstations is being made by Digital Equipment Corp.    The company said it will spend about $50 million this year to promote these systems, as well as other business and industrial products. The promotions will play off Kodak's prominence in photography by introducing such slogans as &quot;More great pictures from Kodak.&quot;    One-third of Kodak's sales, which totaled $11.5 billion in 1986, are generated from business and industrial products, such as copiers and electronic publishing systems. </TEXT></DOC>
