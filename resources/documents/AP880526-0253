He said Africa's struggle had never been ``and will never beanti-white, it will always be anti-apartheid.''   U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz said in a message to theOAU that the United States abhors ``the ugly system of apartheid''and is commited to helping South Africa become a democratic society.   Shultz said he would have attended the meeting, but the dateconflicted with this week's superpower summit. Kenneth Brown, adeputy assistant secretary of state for African affairs, wentinstead.   Kaunda thanked the U.S. Congress for imposing limited sanctionson Pretoria and expressed gratitude to American church leaders andstudents for supporting anti-apartheid efforts.   He also thanked people in Britain, West Germany and France ``whoagainst their governments are supporting our cause,'' and theNordic countries.   The OAU has frequently denounced South Africa and demanded thatWestern governments impose mandatory sanctions against thewhite-led government. At the same time, black Africa does about $1billion a year in business with South Africa, much of it covertly.   Mali's president, Gen. Moussa Traore, was elected Thursday tosucceed Kaunda in the chairman post, which switches every yearbetween representatives of northern and sub-Saharan Africa.   Traore urged the OAU to ``further improve our methods ofstruggle so as to fully dismantle apartheid and increase moral andmaterial support to the peoples of south Africa, Namibia and thefrontline states.''   Traore said OAU efforts to end the Libya-Chad dispute were``clear evidence of the ability of Africa to transcend itsdifferences.''   Kaunda mediated a cease-fire between the North African nationsin September. On Wednesday, Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi toldreporters in Tripoli that he had declared an end to the 15-year-oldwar in honor of the OAU's 25th anniversary.   President Hissene Habre of Chad, attending the summit, expressed``cautious optimism'' about Gadhafi's overture.   Traore also praised Ethiopian leader Mengistu Haile Mariam andSomalia's president, Mohamed Siad Barre, for their resumption ofdiplomatic ties last month after an 11-year break prompted by theirdesert war.   By law and custom in South Africa, apartheid establishes aracially segregated society in which the country's 26 millionblacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whitescontrol the economy and maintain separate districts, schools andhealth services.</TEXT></DOC>
