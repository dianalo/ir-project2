Frank B. Hower Jr., chairman, also said that he expects the bank holding company to post a 10% to 12% increase in earnings for all of 1988. For 1987, Liberty National earned $25.4 million, or $2.48 a share.    Mr. Hower said in an interview that he based his estimates on improving net interest margins and tighter expense control. Also, he said Liberty National continues to have a low level of nonperforming loans.    Liberty National, parent of Liberty National Bank andamp; Trust Co., is the biggest of the independent, Kentucky-based bank holding companies. It had average total assets last year of $2.5 billion.    Accordingly, bankers and analysts see Liberty National as the only concern left in the state with much appeal to an out-of-state buyer, notwithstanding its relatively small size.    Mr. Hower said Liberty National has &quot;no conversations going on right now&quot; about a combination, adding that it wasn't clear that the company would favor a merger. He said he thinks the concern can survive as a midsized independent among giants. &quot;We feel we have enough critical mass&quot; to compete with the new superregionals, Mr. Hower said.    The bank is strongly capitalized, with a primary capital ratio of 8% and a loan-loss reserve that's 219% of its nonperforming loans. Liberty National recently acquired two small banks in neighboring Indiana and expects to close on transactions for three others in Kentucky in coming months.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Liberty National's stock closed at $24.75, down 50 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
