alerts them there are messages stored- or they can retrieve messages from a pay phone or any touch-tone telephone;a second service, called Local Messaging, will enable users to send messagesto other users through the Pacific Bell Message Center wQ! out callingrecipients directly and ringing their phones, and messages may be sent toindividuals or groups of people, as long as all recipients have message boxesin the Message Center - users set up their own group codes and can sendmessages to everyone in a preprogrammed group by pushing a few buttons on thephone;

 1,150); even worse for IBMwould be if too many users decide to extract the IMS or DB/2 data anddownload it - heaven forfend! - to a DEC VAX for transmission.andM;C'est pretty much fait: Cipher Data Products Inc, San Diego has accepted forpayment 4.8m Irwin Magnetic Products Inc shares, 97.2% of the total, and willcomplete in days.andM;Cray Research Inc has now won supercomputer business at the MassachusettsInstitute of Technology, which was persuaded not to buy a supercomputer fromHoneywell-NEC Information Systems: MIT is taking a $7.5m four-processor256M-word Cray-2-4-256 stem, on five-year lease for third quarter delivery.andM;The first major order for ICL's new Carrier400 upmarket X400 messaging systemwritten to run on Stratus Computer Inc kit (CI No 1,151), comes from MCICommunications Corp, which will install a messaging system in Washington bythe third quarter under a contract worth &quot;between $2m and $5m&quot;
