The following summary also contains a listof submissions that were dismissed by the Office of Hearings and Appeals.<ITAG tagnum="84">Appeal</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>William Hyde, 07/22/88, KFA-0197</T3>William Hyde filed an Appeal from a partial denial by the DOE's Idaho OperationsOffice (the Operations Office) of a Request for Information which Mr. Hydehad submitted under the Freedom of Information Act (the FOIA). In consideringthe Appeal, the DOE found that the Operations Office had properly withheldcopies of a draft of a letter written to Mr. Hyde pursuant to the predecisionalprivilege of Exemption 5 of the FOIA but had improperly withheld part ofa short factual summary under that privilege. The DOE further found, however,that a page of a publicly available phone directory should be released.Finally, the DOE found that the Operations Office had made an insufficientdetermination regarding names and a log of contacts between Mr. Hyde anda DOE contractor employee. Consequently, the DOE remanded the case to theOperations Office to make a new determination on these issues.<ITAG tagnum="84">Refund Applications</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Aminoil U.S.A., Inc./Yothers Propane Company, et al., 07/18/88, RF139-105et al.</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning Applications for Refundfiled by five reseller/retailers in the Aminoil U.S.A., Inc. special refundproceeding. The firms submitted cost banks in excess of their refund claimsand market price comparison in support of their claims for refunds exceeding$5,000. After examining the firms' applications and supporting documentation,the DOE concluded that they should receive refunds totaling $238,930, representing$156,008 in principal and $82,922 in interest.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Beacon Oil Company/Soquel Drive Beacon, 07/18/88, RF 238-16</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning an Application for Refundfiled by John A. Gianopoulos on behalf of Soquel Drive Beacon (SDB) inthe Beacon Oil Company (Beacon) special refund proceeding. Mr. Gianopoulospurchased SDB in June 1981_more than six years after the August 19, 1973through March 31, 1975 consent order period. During 1980, SDB received$17,967 of the $33,167 in motor gasoline credit refunds that it was scheduledto receive from Beacon. Although SDB was eligible to apply for the $15,200that remained unpaid when motor gasoline was deregulated on January 28,1981, the firm did not attempt to demonstrate that it was injured by Beacon'salleged overcharges. Instead, SDB claimed a refund under the small claimspresumption of injury whereby a retailer is presumed to have been injuredif it claims a total refund, <T3>including</T3> previous credits received but not passed through toits customers, equal to $5,000 or less. Mr. Gianopoulos did not provideany material demonstrating that SDB passed through to its customers thepreviously received credit or that he was the appropriate party to applyfor any refund. Instead, Mr. Gianopoulas offered to split any refund monieswith the OHA analyst assigned to this case in return for favorable considerationof the SDB claim. Accordingly, the Application for Refund was denied andthe matter referred to the DOE's Office of Inspector General for additionalinvestigation and possible prosecution.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Central Iowa Power Cooperative, New England Telephone and TelegraphCo., 07/21/88, RF272-61 and RF272-6304</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting refunds from crude oil overchargefunds to Central Iowa Power Cooperative (CIPC) and New England Telephoneand Telegraph Company (NETTC). During the crude oil settlement period,August 19, 1973 through January 27, 1981, CIPC operated as an electricitygeneration and transmission cooperative and NETTC operated as a publictelephone utility. The DOE found that both applicants had provided sufficientevidence of the volume of refined petroleum products purchased during thecrude oil settlement period, and both firms certified that they would passthrough the refunds received to their customers. In reaching its determinations,the DOE rejected the comments submitted by a group of States in oppositionto CIPC's and NETTC's claims. Specifically, the DOE found that the Stateshad not demonstrated that CIPC and NETTC were ineligible to receive refundson behalf of their injured customers. Accordingly, DOE approved refundsof $2,421 to CIPC and $17,754 to NETTC based upon the amount of their respectivepurchases and the volumetric refund amount currently available, $0.0002per gallon.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Dale's Mobil Service, et al., 07/21/88, RF272-44164, et al.</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order, denying twenty-nine Applications forRefund filed in the crude oil overcharge refund proceeding. Each Applicantwas either a reseller or a retailer during the period August 19, 1973 throughJanuary 27, 1981. Because non of the Applicants demonstrated that is wasinjured due to crude oil overcharges, none was eligible for a crude oilrefund.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Getty Oil Company/Beck Oil Company, et al., 07/22/88, RF265-2695, etal.</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning seven Applications for Refundfiled by resellers or retailers of products covered by a consent orderthat the DOE entered into with Getty Oil Company. Each applicant submittedinformation indicating the volume of propane or motor gasoline purchasedfrom Getty during the consent order period. In five of the Applications,the Applicants were eligible for a refund below the small claims thresholdof $5,000. In the remaining two Applications, both Applicants elected tolimit their claims to $5,000. The total amount of refunds approved in theDecision and Order is $50,163, representing $24,536 in principal and $25,627in accrued interest.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Getty Oil Company/Viking Truck Stop, Inc., 07/21/88, RF265-1558</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning an Application for Refundfiled by Viking Truck Stop, Inc. (Viking), a retailer of motor gasolinecovered by a Consent Order that the DOE entered into with Getty Oil Company.The Applicant submitted information indicating the volume of Getty motorgasoline that was indirectly purchased through Richard Oil Company (Richard)during the consent order period. Viking was eligible for a refund, basedon Richard's passthrough percentage of 60.0033 percent, which was belowthe small claims threshold of $5,000. The refund approved below the smallclaims threshold of $5,000. The refund approved in this Decision is $2,103,representing $1,030 in principal and $1,073 in accured interest.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Getty Oil Company/Whitehill Gas and Oil Co. et al., 07/21/88, RF265-0498,et al.</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning 24 Applications for Refundfiled by resellers or retailers of products covered by a Consent Orderthat the Doe entered into with Getty Oil Company. Each of the Applicantssubmitted information indicating the volume of its Getty purchases. EachApplicant elected to limit its claim on the basis of the level-of-distributionpresumption of injury methodology and was eligible for a refund below themaximum threshold of $50,000. The sum of the refunds approved in this Decisionis $266,006, representing $130,271 in principal and $135,735 in accruedinterest.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>L.C. Base, 07/18/88, RF272-12696</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting a refund from crude oil overchargefunds to L.C. Base with respect to his purchases of refined petroleum productsduring the period August 19, 1973 through January 27, 1981. Base used theproducts for various agricultural activities, including his custom harvestingactivities. Base determined his claim by estimating his petroleum productconsumption based on the acres he farmed, and the average acres per yearhe custom harvested for others. The DOE determined that Base was an end-userof the petroleum products claimed and was therefore presumed injured. Therefund granted to Base in this Decision is $16. Base will be eligible foradditional refunds as additional crude oil overcharges funds become available.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Marathon Petroleum Company/Tenneco Oil Company, 07/20/88, RF250-2374</T3>et al.The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning five Applications for Refundfiled by Tenneco Oil Company in connection with the Marathon PetroleumCompany special refund proceeding. Four of Tenneco's applications werebased on its purchases of Marathon motor gasoline, middle distillates,naphthas, and butane on the spot market. Tenneco elected not to attemptto rebut the presumption that spot purchasers were not injured by Marathon'salleged overcharges. Therefore, Tenneco was not eligible to receive a refundfor its purchases of those Marathon products. However, Tenneco was eligibleto receive a refund based on its purchases of Marathon residual fuels (CaseNo. RF250-2374, RF250-2375, RF250-2376, RF250-2377, RF250-2741). The totalrefund approved in this Decision is $7,062 in principal and $1,227 in interest.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Mobil Oil Company/Gulf States Oil and Refining Co., 07/22/88, RF225-6146and RF225-6147</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order denying an Application for Refund fromthe Mobil Oil Corporation escrow account, filed by Gulf States Oil andRefining Co. In its Application, Gulf claimed that it purchased 94,415,549gallons of Mobil motor gasoline and natural gas liquids during the consentorder period. However, the DOE found that the purchases appeared to bespot purchases. The underlying Mobil proceeding had established a rebuttablepresumption that spot purchasers were not injured. <T3>Mobil Oil Corp., </T3>13 DOE andpara; 85,339 (1985). The DOE notifiedGulf States that this presumption would be applied to its claim, but GulfStates declined the opportunity to submit rebutting evidence. The DOE accordinglydenied the Application.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Mobil Oil Corp./Jack L. Grace, Graces Service Center, 07/19/88, RF225-11040and RF225-54002</T3>The DOE issued a Supplemental Order in the Mobil Oil Corp. special refundproceeding. In a previous Decision, Jack L. Grace had been denied a refundfor failure to provide required information. <T3>Mobil Oil Corp./Jack L. Grace, </T3>17 DOE andpara; 85,558, (1988). Inresponse, Grace demonstrated that it had submitted the required informationbut that the submission had inadvertently been considered as a separatecase in another refund proceeding. The DOE dismissed the inadvertent filingand reinstated Grace's Application in the Mobil refund proceeding. In accordancewith the procedures outlined in <T3>Mobil Oil Corp., </T3>13 DOE andpara; 85,339 (1985), Grace was granteda refund totaling $544 ($436 in principal plus $108 in accrued interest).<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Mobil Oil Corporation/Reynolds Industries, Inc., 07/18/88,</T3> <T3>RF225-5185</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting in part an Application forRefund from the Mobil Oil Corporation escrow account filed by ReynoldsIndustries, Inc. (Reynolds), a retailer of Mobil refined petroleum products.In its Application, Reynolds claimed that Mobil had improperly discontinueda discount. As a result of Mobil's action, Reynolds claimed that it hadexperienced an alleged injury of $0.035 per gallon of motor gasoline purchasedfrom Mobil. Reynolds further alleged that Mobil had improperly denied Reynolds'Everett II retail outlet volumes of motor gasoline. As a remedy for thesealleged injuries, Reynolds requested a $0.035 per-gallon refund for thosegallons purchased for which Mobil had denied the discount and a $0.10 pergallon refund for those gallons that Mobil had denied to Reynolds. In reviewingReynolds' above-volumetric refund claim, the DOE determined that sincea federal District Court and the Temporary Emergency Court of Appeals hadheld that Mobil's termination of the discount to Reynolds was lawful, Reynoldshad not experienced an alleged overcharge as a result of Mobil's actionand was not eligible to receive a refund in excess of the volumetric refundamount. With respect to Reynolds's allocation claim, however, the DOE determinedthat the firm was eligible to receive a refund of $0.0718 per gallon for369,775 gallons of Mobil motor gasoline that Mobil had failed to supplyto Reynolds. Based on these determinations, the DOE concluded that Reynoldswas eligible to receive a refund of $44,802, representing $35,928 in principalplus $8,87k4 in interest.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Plaquemines Oil Sales Corp./Mobil Oil Corporation,</T3><T3> 07/22/88, </T3><T3>RF305-9</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order approving the Application for Refundfiled by Mobil Oil Corporation (Mobil), a purchaser of Plaquemines OilSales Corp. (POSC) No. 2 diesel fuel. Mobil applied for a refund as anend-user based on the procedures outlined in <T3>Plaquemines Oil Sales Corp.,</T3> 17 DOE andpara;85,059 (1988). Mobilwas identified as an overcharged purchaser of No. 2 diesel fuel in the<T3>POSC</T3> decision. After examining the application and supportinginformation, the DOE determined that since Mobil used the diesel fuel inoffshore oil drilling, it was an end-user for purposes of this proceedingand granted the firm a refund of $38,763 (27,105 in principal plus $11,658in interest).<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Point Landing, Inc./International Trading and Transportation, Ltd.,</T3><T3> 07/18/88, </T3><T3>RF122-9</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning an Application for Refundfiled on behalf of International Trading and Transportation, Ltd. (ITT),a spot purchaser of Point Landing, Inc. (Point Landing) No. 2 diesel fuel.ITT applied for a refund based on the procedures governing the disbursementof settlement funds received from Point Landing pursuant to a September9, 1980 Consent Order. According to those procedures, end-users are presumedto have been injured by Point Landing's alleged overcharges; spot purchasersare presumed not to have been injured. Although it was a spot purchaser,ITT claimed that it had been injured. The firm also alleged that its parentcompany, International Tank Terminals, Ltd. (ITTP), had consumed a portionof the diesel fuel that ITT had purchased from Point Landing during theOctober 1, 1973 through November 30, 1974 consent order period. ITT thereforeclaimed that it should at least receive a partial refund under the end-userpresumption of injury. The DOE determined that ITT had not rebutted thespot purchaser presumption of non-injury or documented that the dieselfuel consumed by ITTP had originated with Point Landing. Accordingly, ITT'sApplication for Refund was denied.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Suburban Propane Gas Corporation/Odessa L.P.G. Transport, Inc., </T3><T3>07/18/88, </T3><T3>RF299-84</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting an Application for Refundfrom the Suburban Propane Gas Corporation escrow account filed by OdessaL.P.G. Transport, Inc., a reseller/retailer of Suburban propane and butaneduring the period November 1, 1973 through October 31, 1978. Odessa electedto apply for a refund based upon the presumptions set forth in <T3>Suburban Propane Gas Corporation,</T3> 16 DOE andpara;85,382 (1987).The DOE therefore granted the firm a refund of $23,187 ($20,375 principalplus $2,812 in interest).<ITAG tagnum="84">Crude Oil End-Users</ITAG>The Office of Hearings and Appeals granted crude oil overcharge refundsto end-user applicants in the following Decisions and Orders:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>5,L2,tp0,i1,s150,xls60,8,6,6</C> <H1>Name</H1><H1>Case No.</H1><H1>Date</H1><H1>No. of applicants</H1><H1>Total refund</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Dale Shankleton et al<D>RF272-28600</D><D>7/21/88</D><D>164</D><D>$4,589</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Dodge County Sheriff's Dept. et al<D>RF272-25001</D><D>7/18/88</D><D>146</D><D>3,815</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Duane Paul Leonard et al<D>RF272-22400</D><D>7/20/88</D><D>133</D><D>4,400</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Edgar Ohrt et al<D>RF272-29000</D><D>7/20/88</D><D>178</D><D>3,956</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Ferrel Harvey et al<D>RF272-27202</D><D>7/18/88</D><D>102</D><D>2,894</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">George Waldschmidt et al<D>RF272-25400</D><D>7/18/88</D><D>123</D><D>3,758</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Griffith Farms et al<D>RF272-1667</D><D>7/18/88</D><D>117</D><D>6,385</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Hart's Trucking et al<D>RF272-26200</D><D>7/18/88</D><D>162</D><D>3,977</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Herbert D.
