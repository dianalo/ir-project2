Everyone also knows that the political clout of theelderly will continue to grow along with their numbers(especially after the baby boomers begin to retire), the neteffect of which may be that America cannot afford to growold.   &quot;Everyone,&quot; however, is in the process of being provedwrong.</LP><TEXT>   The elderly, age 62 and older, expanded from 10.5% of thepopulation in 1950 to 15% in 1988. The Census Bureau projectsthat they will account for more than 25% by the year 2030.Nevertheless, descriptive, econometric and anecdotalevidence, the details of which are covered in a recent reportfrom the Center for the Study of American Business, point toa conclusion at odds with conventional wisdom: Elderlywelfare benefits in the form of Social Security and Medicareare in retreat -- because of the growth in the elderlypopulation.   Total elderly welfare benefits in constant (1988) dollarsexpanded rapidly from the 1950s through the 1970s. Realper-capita benefits more than doubled between 1960 and 1970and rose by an added 61% between 1970 and 1980. However, thegrowth rate in real per-capita benefits was fallingthroughout almost all the 1960-80 period.   Real benefits per capita were flat during most of the1980s. Indeed, real per-capita benefits (net of taxes onSocial Security payments and Medicare premiums) in 1988,$6,072, were 2.5% below their peak in 1986, $6,229, and wereeven slightly below their real level of 1982, $6,100.   Relative to the economy and the rest of governmentspending, elderly benefits were retreating even moredramatically. After rising for decades, per-capita elderlybenefits peaked at almost 45% of per-capita gross nationalproduct in 1982. By 1988, elderly benefits were down to under37% of per-capita GNP.   The elderly's lost political position cannot be attributedsolely to a leveling of all federal spending. From 1982 to1988 elderly benefits per capita fell 12% relative tononelderly per-capita federal outlays.   The evident decline in the political muscle of seniorcitizens should have been expected. The retreat in elderlybenefits is the corollary of an established economic theory,&quot;the law of the few.&quot; For decades, Milton Friedman, MancurOlson and many other scholars have argued that farmers wereable to obtain massive federal subsidies beginning in the1930s because by then their number had dwindled to less than25% of the population.   With the shrinking number of farmers, there wasprogressively more nonfarm income for the federal governmentto take and to redistribute to farmers. In addition, the farmlobby became more effective because, with a smaller number,farmers were better able to cohere politically and tosuppress the infamous &quot;free rider&quot; problem, or the tendencyof members of a large interest group to sit back and allowothers to do the political legwork and make the campaigncontributions so crucial to developing and maintainingpolitical influence -- and federal largess.   The corollary is &quot;the law of the many&quot;: The greater thegroup size (above some critical mass), the smaller thepolitical influence in Washington.   The continuing growth in size of the elderly populationshould, beyond some point, reduce the elderly's ability topresent a united political front, mainly because of thedeveloping free-rider problem and because the economic andpolitical agendas of the elderly should become more diverseand, often, conflict. The cost of activating the elderly asan interest group should be expected to escalate with thegrowth in numbers, the net effect of which should be atempering of the willingness of the elderly, and theirrepresentatives, to work for expanded benefits.   The political clout of the elderly should also be undercutby the relative contraction of nonelderly income that can betaken and redistributed to the elderly; by the conflictbetween current beneficiaries who want larger checks and theneed to service an expanding number of retirees; and by theemergence of smaller, more politically effective interestgroups (for example, victims of imports, civil-rightsviolations and AIDS) that are able to divert the legislativeattention of politicians from the economic interests of theelderly.   When the elderly's total welfare benefits represent asmall sum, politicians may have little interest in taxingthem, mainly because the revenue yield may not be worth thetrouble of upsetting the elderly. But when total benefitsexceed $200 billion, which they did in the 1980s, the elderlyshould expect their benefits to become just another taxtarget, especially when younger taxpayers are beset withrising Social Security and Medicare tax rates.   Total real elderly benefits may continue to rise for yearsas the growth in the elderly population more than offsets theprojected decline in real benefits per capita. However, eventotal benefits may decline after 2004.   Such projections might be dismissed as fancifulstatistical manipulations if they were not supported by ahistorical record of changes in benefits and by congressionaland administrative actions that have, or will, undercut realelderly benefits, net of taxes and insurance premiums.   The most prominent of these congressional actions includeincreases in insurance premiums and restrictions on medicalbenefits (facts of last fall's budget accord), a change inthe method of compensating for cost-of-living increases(which suppressed the growth in real benefits), the taxationof Social Security benefits beginning in 1984, and theincrease by scheduled steps in the age at which fullretirement benefits can be received from 65 in 2000 to 67 in2022 (a reversal of past congressional inclinations).President Bush's proposed $23 billion additional cut inMedicare benefits is the most recent sign of the elderly'slanguishing political clout.   Given much current Washington talk about taxing a greatershare of Social Security benefits, cutting the cost-of-livingadjustments and benefits, and privatizing the elderly welfaresystem, the projections confirm the growing politicaldistress among the elderly. The projections also offer somehope that future Congresses will be able to lower the SocialSecurity tax burden on the working population.   ---   Mr. McKenzie is a professor of economics at the Universityof Mississippi.</TEXT></DOC>
