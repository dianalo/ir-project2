He declined to say what, if any, steps the United States mighttake if China goes ahead with executions.   The White House announcement came on the heels of demands inCongress and elsewhere that the United States intensify itscondemnation of Chinese repression and consider further sanctionsagainst the Beijing government.   Fitzwater said China's ambassador to the United States, Han Xu,was called to the State Department Monday night to hear what thespokesman called ``the strong United States' position.''   Hinting at worsening relations between Beijing and Washington,Fitzwater said ``the United States raised this subject in the spiritof a country that has worked with China over the past two decades toimprove relations.   ``We believe that human rights are universal, and our duty tocomment on them is great,'' Fitzwater said.   ``We urge the leaders of the Peoples Republic of China to showclemency and to use their powers to pardon those who were arrestedin the demonstrations for democracy,'' Fitzwater said.   Human rights are ``an important principle by which the UnitedStates judges its relations'' with all countries in the world, hesaid.</TEXT><NOTE>Following 0 grafs embargoed for release at 2 p.m. EDT</NOTE><TEXT>      Secretary of State James A. Baker III said in prepared testimonyfor the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the United Statesstrongly supports reform in the communist world and accused Sovietleader Mikhail S. Gorbachev of dodging the China issue.   ``To stand in the way of such necessary historic changes _ as weare seeing to our outrage and sorrow in China _ is to turn one'sback on the future,'' he said.   Gorbachev's ``temporizing comments on those tragic events aredisappointing,'' Baker said.   On a visit last week to West Germany, Gorbachev said he did nothave ``sufficient information'' on what was happening in China tomake a ``balanced and responsible'' judgment.</TEXT><NOTE>End Embargoed Material</NOTE><TEXT>      Although the administration is trying to keep Americans fromreturning to China, only military transactions with Beijing havebeen suspended by Bush.   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., and other lawmakers havecalled on Bush to consider other punitive measures and also step upU.S. condemnation of the Chinese government.   At a news conference almost two weeks ago, Bush rejected thesuggestion of more sanctions against China, saying the halt ofweapons sales went far enough under present circumstances. ``I thinkthat the position we took, aiming not at the Chinese people but atthe military arrangements, was well-received around the world, andwas followed by many countries right after we did that,'' he said.   Chinese dissident Fang Lizhi and his wife, Li Shuxian, tookrefuge June 4 at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing shortly after themilitary crushed pro-democracy protests.   Fang has led Chinese intellectuals in calling for release ofpolitical prisoners and asserting that economic and scientificprogress is impossible without protections for free thought. He wasalso angered the Chinese by saying Marxism is dead.   State Department spokeswoman Margaret D. Tutwiler said MondayAmerican workers are being advised strongly not to return to jobs inChina. ``We're not going to lift our travel advisory. That remainsin effect,'' she said.   The advisory _ which is a suggestion and not an order _ wasposted after Chinese Army troops attacked students demonstrating fora more liberal regime June 3-4 in Tiananmen Square.   Thousands of Americans subsequently left China, some with U.S.assistance, thereby stripping U.S. companies of many of their keypersonnel.   About 175 American companies have offices in China. Many of themhave received word from their Chinese partners in joint venturesreporting that the turmoil has subsided.   Ms. Tutwiler said that despite ``a pause in anti-U.S. propagandaover the weekend,'' the situation in China remains ``far fromnormal.''   She said criticism of the Voice of America resumed on Saturday,and that articles had appeared attacking expelled VOA Bureau ChiefAlan Pessin and Associated Press correspondent John Pomfret.   On Sunday, the official New China News Agency said Fitzwater'scriticism of death sentences imposed on three Chinese for burning atrain was ``ridiculous.''</TEXT></DOC>
