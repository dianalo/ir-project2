Reel-to-reelprocessing, with its labor and quality advantages, is discussed in thefirst paper, which deals with the manufacture of flexible circuits. Amethod for disposing of hazardous waste, a concern to production andenvironmental types alike, is presented in the paper on the Mound GlassMelter. Quality control per se in its statistical aspects is coveredin yet another article. A particularly successful application of barcoding technology, which benefits the accuracy of data and the speedof data transfer, is documented. And, finally, two papers touch on completelydifferent aspects of our CIM (computer integrated manufacturing) effort.One addresses the installation of a Local Area Network, which enhancesproductivity through enhancing communications; the other describes aFlexible Machining Cell, used to manufacture small volume lots of productwith NC programs, in which human error has been practically eliminated.</TEXT></DOC>
