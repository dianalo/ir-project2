His antipathy for deficits, buyouts and bad lending practices hasearned Grant a reputation in the business world as a miserly partypooper in an era of unbridled excess.   But even people who disagree with him say Grant isthought-provoking, entertaining and may one day prove correct in hiswarnings that the system cannot live on borrowed money indefinitely.   ``I am out of step with the times,'' the writer of thetwice-monthly ``Grant's Interest Rate Observer'' said in a speechlast month to the Conference of Business Economists in Washington.   Today, he said, ``it is possible to get a 40-year mortgage loan;a bullet-style, floating-rate home-equity loan; a six-year autoloan; a Sotheby's art-equity loan; a $50 billion, zero-couponsecured savings-and-loan bailout loan, and a high-yield, payment inkind LBO loan.   ``It is hard, in fact, not to get one or more of those loans, ifyou have a functioning mailbox into which credit cards can bedropped.''   Little known six years ago when he started the newsletter, Grantnow has 3,000 subscribers who pay $375 a year to absorb his wit,wisdom and statistics. Readers range from billionaire entrepreneursMalcolm Forbes and Laurence Tisch to LBO strategist TheodoreForstmann and PaineWebber Inc. chief executive Donald Marron.   ``It's always a pleasure to read that letter,'' said Leon Levy, apartner at Odyssey Partners, a New York investment firm that pursuesthe kind of debt-financed dealmaking Grant routinely rails against.   ``It is witty, lively, anecdotal and to the point, and I thinkthe stories he tells are always quotable,'' Levy said. ``And who cantell, one of these days, he may be right.''   In recent issues, Grant has satirized the lousy credit rating ofDuff andamp; Phelps Corp., a debt-rating agency that tripled its own debtin a management buyout. He termed Citicorp's new 15-minute mortgageidea, aimed at wooing customers with promises of quick approval fortheir loans, the ``McMortgage.''   When a $20 billion-plus bidding war broke out last year for RJRNabisco Inc., with rival suitors promising to finance a takeoveralmost entirely with borrowed money, Grant's newsletter responded byprinting a mock proposal for a $115 billion debt-financed purchaseof International Business Machines Corp.   ``With these GNP-sized deals, parody seems more appropriate thancommentary,'' he said.   Grant routinely admonishes against the purchase of junk bonds,the high-yield, high-risk securities that evolved into the fuel forthe 1980s debt-financed takeover era.   He is equally suspicious of Michael Milken, the Drexel BurnhamLambert Inc. financier who helped transform junk bonds into a $175billion business and has been the target of a federal fraudinvestigation for more than two years.   Grant once said he considers himself ``cast in the role of BillyGraham opposite a Hugh Hefner played by Michael Milken.''   Tall, lanky, with Clark Kent eyeglasses and self-effacing smile,the 42-year-old writer works out of a rented office on the 40thfloor of the Woolworth building in southern Manhattan, an ornateskyscraper purchased by the retailing giant's founder F. W.Woolworth in 1913 for $13.5 million in cash.   It's one of the few prime properties on the world's mostexpensive piece of real estate that has no mortgage or lien on it,Grant tells visitors, adding: ``I wouldn't rent anywhere else.''   A native Long Islander, Grant got into writing after graduatingIndiana University and the Columbia School of International Affairs.He was a credit-markets columnist at Barron's financial weekly foreight years before quitting to start the newsletter in 1983.   Grant has said he never intended for ``Interest Rate Observer''to evolve into a critique of credit, but the relentless pace ofborrowing in the economy increasingly alarmed him and reshaped thenewsletter's focus.   It was the 1984 debt-refinancing of Metromedia Inc. five yearsago _ largely though the sale of what then was the largest junk-bondoffering in history _ that helped convince Grant of the dangerslurking in such deals.   Grant doesn't oppose the concept of debt. But he says the greaterthe level of borrowed money greasing the economy, the greater thechance the debt won't be repaid, inciting a chain reaction of eventsthat inevitably will mean sharply higher interest rates,unemployment and recession.   ``Debt magnifies results,'' he said in an interview. ``It'smagnified the business expansion of the past six years, bringing inmarginal consumers and helping employ marginal workers. But whendebt becomes available on more onerous terms, we'll see theamplification on the downside.''   As for his own financial health, Grant said, the newsletter issupporting him and wife Patricia Kavanagh, who quit her job as aWall Street investment banker to help him publish it. They have fourchildren aged 1 to 8.   Grant and his family aren't totally immune from the enticementsof borrowing. The credit cards in his wallet attest to that.   ``We have a lot of them,'' he said. ``We try not to use too manyat once.''</TEXT><NOTE>End adv Sunday March 5</NOTE></DOC>
