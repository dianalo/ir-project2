But despite the warnings, some of Israel's strongestsupporters fear that Mr. Shamir won't alter Israel'sprovocative behavior, which is alienating the Bushadministration and a growing number of Americans. The resultcould be a bitter clash between the two longtime allies.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;One of the two sides has got to blink, or we're really ona collision course,&quot; warns Stuart Eizenstat, a formerofficial in the Carter administration and a pro-Israelactivist.   Only two months ago, Mr. Shamir and the powerful Israellobby were confident that Israel's request for $10 billion inU.S. loan guarantees would glide through Congress. ButPresident Bush's success in winning a 120-day postponement incongressional consideration of the request underscores howthe once special U.S.-Israel relationship has changed.   The administration considers Israel's insistence onexpanding settlements in the occupied territories a majorobstacle to its efforts to initiate Middle East peace talks,and it wants restrictions on the settlements attached to loanguarantees.   More broadly, Israel is being told by its U.S. supportersthat it must adjust to a changed political climate in theU.S. America, they say, is turning inward, is less inclinedto offer foreign aid to anyone and holds an increasinglynegative view of the Jewish state.   In an article last month in an Israeli newspaper, AbrahamFoxman, national director of the staunchly pro-IsraelAnti-Defamation League, said, &quot;Israeli policymakers have anobligation to make decisions based on reality. . . .Ultimately, Israel will have to choose. Are the loanguarantees more important than the current settlementpolicy?&quot;   Henry Siegman, executive director of the American JewishCongress, adds: &quot;There's an increased willingness {in theU.S.} to speak out openly about the problems posed by certainkinds of Israeli policies, to tell the Israelis that certainthings just won't wash with the Congress, the administrationand the American people.&quot;   But Israel's Likud government appears willing to risk itsspecial relationship with Washington. One pro-Israel analystsays that the top priority of Mr. Shamir's right-wing Likudbloc has always been to assure, through the building ofsettlements, that Israel will never lose control of theoccupied West Bank. Likud members know that Israel'spopulation is almost evenly divided over the idea ofexchanging occupied land for peace, and they fear that if theLabor Party someday comes to power it would cede some of theterritories in negotiations.   The prospect of as many as one million Soviet Jews comingto Israel in the next five years vastly strengthens Mr.Shamir's hand. Some Israelis have estimated that, as a resultof the influx, about 50,000 Israelis will move to theterritories in the next two to three years, joining 100,000who have settled there in the past 24 years.   President Bush believes that if such a trend continuesthere will be nothing left for Arabs and Israelis tonegotiate about. But Mr. Shamir recently told a visiting U.S.Jewish leader that Israel's settlements policy was &quot;the bestthing for the peace process&quot; because it brings home to theArabs that time is working against them if they delaynegotiations.   Mr. Shamir appears to be gambling that while settlementexpansion continues, Israel's staunch supporters will preventmajor damage from occurring in U.S. relations. But he may notunderstand the profound changes occurring in therelationship. The U.S. budget crunch has made any foreignassistance politically unattractive. The end of the Cold Warhas depreciated Israel's strategic value to Washingtonagainst Soviet encroachment in the Middle East. Moreover,Israel's harsh treatment of the Palestinians during thefour-year &quot;intifada,&quot; or uprising, has eroded its image as astruggling democracy.   According to a recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll,70% of U.S. voters lined up with President Bush on the loanguarantee issue. Only 44% believe that Washington shouldprovide any economic aid to Israel. By contrast, 58% favorsuch aid to the Soviet Union.   &quot;We are moving toward a relationship with Israel wheresome of the special dimensions simply aren't there anymore,&quot;says William Quandt, a Mideast expert at the BrookingsInstitution.</TEXT></DOC>
