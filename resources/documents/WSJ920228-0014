Last year, Scan-Graphics' auditors, BDO Seidman, expressed&quot;substantial doubt&quot; about the company's ability to continueas a going concern. But with a $5 million private placementcompleted late last year, Scan-Graphics was able to wipe$770,000 in interim financing notes from its books andreinitiate funding for projects that had been stymied orhalted by the company's capital problems.</LP><TEXT>   But Scan-Graphics didn't emerge unscathed in the fourthquarter. Michael A. Mulshine, director of corporatedevelopment, said the company expects to report afourth-quarter net loss of $491,000, or nine cents a share,compared with a yearearlier loss of $262,639, or five cents ashare based on shares outstanding before the privateplacement. Much of the loss was attributed to costs of$162,000 in retroactive salaries and $352,000 for specialbonuses to top executives that had been promised earlier.   &quot;A number of people worked a very long time at very lowlevels of income,&quot; said Mr. Mulshine, who held a 7% stake inScan-Graphics before the placement and remains its secondlargest shareholder. Before the charges, the company had netincome of $23,060, equal to zero per-share earnings. Sales inthe fourth quarter rose 28% to $1.2 million from $963,000.   For the full year, the company expects to report a netloss of $844,000, or 16 cents a share, compared with a lossof $1 million, or 36 cents a share, in 1990. Sales rose 56%to $3.8 million. Mr. Mulshine predicted 1992 annual sales ofbetween $8 million and $10 million and net in the $1.6million to $2 million range. Revenue in the first quarter ispredicted at between $1 million and $1,750,000.   Significant profit would mark a turnaround forScan-Graphics, which plowed much of its revenue back intoresearch and product development in past years. But Mr.Mulshine said most of the necessary investments have alreadybeen made for the company to commercialize its large-documentimage scanners and software. Large-document imaging dealswith computerized imaging, storing and retrieving ofoversized documents, particularly such items as engineeringplans or architectural drawings.</TEXT></DOC>
