When the naturalenergy is interrupted or reduced, an electrically operated clutch isengaged so that an internal combustion engine is started by the flywheeland thereafter drives the machine as a generator to power the load. Theflywheel is also used to drive the machine during the changeover of thedrive of machine from generator to engine. The flywheel may rotate ina evacuated chamber. In a modification, the machine motors the engineat reduced speed via a speed reducer and a first unidirectional clutchduring normal periods, and means responsive to a fall in output fromgenerator controls fuel supply or ignition to start the engine whichthen drives the machine through a second unidirectional clutch.</TEXT></DOC>
