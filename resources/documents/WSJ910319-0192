Barrett   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>02/27/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), NO PAGE CITATION</SO><GV>CONGRESS (CNG)</GV><LP>   WASHINGTON -- Senate Democrats assailed President Bush'snominee for drug &quot;czar,&quot; Bob Martinez, for lacking expertisein the field and for opposing a ban on military-style assaultweapons.   But Mr. Martinez, a former governor of Florida with strongWhite House connections, appeared headed for Senateconfirmation after his first day of testimony before theJudiciary Committee.</LP><TEXT>   Only one committee member, Sen. Paul Simon (D., Ill.),said he would vote against the nominee, while severalmembers, including Chairman Joseph Biden (D., Del.), saidthey expect Mr. Martinez to be confirmed by the full Senate.   Republicans praised the 56-year-old nominee, who is also aformer teacher and a former mayor of Tampa, for his &quot;wealthof experience,&quot; as Sen. Orrin Hatch (R., Utah), put it.   Mr. Martinez responded to both criticism and complimentsin a conciliatory fashion that was a sharp contrast to theconfrontational style of his predecessor, William Bennett,who quit in November. &quot;By nature, I don't go out looking forbattles,&quot; Mr. Martinez told the committee yesterday afterSen. Biden warned him against the sort of partisanpoliticking in which Mr. Bennett had engaged.   Though clearly attempting to mollify critics who argued hewasn't qualified for the job of director of national drugcontrol policy, Mr. Martinez didn't offer specifics aboutpolicies he would pursue. He said that &quot;everyone who wants{drug} treatment ought to have it,&quot; but he didn't say howthis could be accomplished or when.   As governor, Mr. Martinez stressed law-enforcementresponses to Florida's high levels of drug use and crime.Republicans lauded his stiffening of criminal penalties anddoubling the size of the state's prison system. But Sen.Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.) noted that when Mr. Martinez losthis re-election bid last November, Florida had one of thenation's highest crime rates and was granting early releaseto an increasing number of felons, in part because of thehuge number of people imprisoned for drug-possessionoffenses.   Mr. Martinez said he had &quot;moved away from the concept ofusing only the prisons&quot; to punish drug crimes and stressedhis devotion to education programs. He said he favors drugtesting for workers as well as applicants for driver'slicenses but not for purchasers of assault weapons or otherguns. Mr. Martinez defended President Bush's policy offavoring longer prison terms for weapons offenders butopposing federal gun control.   Among the allegations raised by his critics yesterday wasone that while serving as Tampa's mayor, Mr. Martinez was adirector of a small bank that purportedly gave loans to drugtraffickers. Mr. Martinez acknowledged that he was a boardmember at Key Bank of Florida, but he insisted, &quot;I had noknowledge of those transactions, no knowledge of thoseindividuals.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
