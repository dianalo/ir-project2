Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, promised anew to examine thefailure of Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan Association ofDenver. President Bush's son, Neil, served on the thrift's board.Regulators have said the younger Bush had questionable businessties to Silverado borrowers.   The committee will hold a March 26 hearing on the failure ofCenTrust Savings Bank of Miami. A month ago, CenTrust became thefirst Sandamp;L to fail because of junk bond losses. It was also knownfor spending deposits on a museum-quality art collection, lavishsalaries, a yacht and limousines.   On May 2-3, the committee will look at Drexel Burnham LambertInc. and what Gonzalez called a ``daisy chain'' operation in whichjunk bonds were shuffled around the country among institutions _including Lincoln, Silverado and CenTrust.   Gonzalez plans field hearings April 11-12 in Dallas to examinethrift collapses in Texas. He said he hoped to subpoena the formerexecutives of Vernon Savings and Loan Association and SunbeltFederal Savings and Loan Association.   The panel will also look at the government's 1988 bailout saleof American Savings and Loan Association, Stockton, Calif., toTexas financier Robert Bass, Gonzalez said.   Tuesday's hearing, the seventh by the committee focusing onLincoln, scrutinized the web of interlocking land deals involvingHidden Valley and Estrella, which were to be a massive residentialdevelopments in the desert 20 miles southwest of Phoenix.   Chris Seefer, an examiner in the Office of Thrift Supervision'sSan Francisco office, complained that political appointees in theagency's Washington headquarters blocked field examiners fromscrutinizing the projects, after meeting with Lincoln owner CharlesKeating Jr. in September 1987. He estimated that caused $200million of Lincoln's $2 billion loss.   Gonzalez had invited Charles H. Keating III, son of Lincoln'sowner, to testify, but he did not appear.   The younger Keating, while still in his 20s, drew a $1 millionannual salary from Lincoln's parent company, American ContinentalCorp., for handling many of his father's real estate ventures.   ``The absence says much about the cavalier attitude'' of theKeatings, Gonzalez said. He had intended to subpoena the youngerKeating, but had not been able to gather the majority of his51-member committee needed to vote on the action.   For the most part, the hearing covered old ground, examining aland deal between Lincoln and Ernest C. Garcia, a Tucson developerand stockbroker. Lincoln was able to manufacture profits by lendingGarcia $19.6 million, which was never repaid.   Garcia used the money to buy the Hidden Valley land through astraw buyer, Fernando R. Acosta.   The transaction has been examined in detail in public hearingsbefore U.S. District Court Judge Stanley Sporkin, who is to decideon a motion to dismiss Keating's lawsuit seeking to reclaimLincoln. The Sandamp;L was seized by the government in April.   Garcia, who had been subpoenaed by the committee, appeared butrefused to answer questions, asserting his constitutional right toavoid self-incrimination.   Acosta testified briefly, saying he acted as a straw buyer inthe Hidden Valley sale as a favor to Garcia and did not considerhis actions improper. He disclosed he had been questioned by theFBI and Securities and Exchange Commission about the transaction.   Gonzalez told reporters his committee would release its reporton the Lincoln failure soon, possibly in a week.</TEXT></DOC>
