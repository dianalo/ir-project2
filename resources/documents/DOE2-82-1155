Themethane bacteria, which are used to inject the biomass in the fermentationreactor, are fermented separately in feeding solutions. The biologicalreactor is a system heated by a thermostatically controlled waterbath,with at least 12 individual digestion chambers, which are filled in sequencewith biomass. Circulation and therefore destruction of the floating sludgelayer is done with biogas produced under pressure in the system. By addinglime solution, a pH value of 7 is set in the chambers. The advantagesof the invention consist of a shortened digestion time (6 days) and areduced CO/sub 2/ consist at a gas yield of 80%.</TEXT></DOC>
