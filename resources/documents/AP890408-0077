Thehostage-taking charge could bring a maximum sentence of lifeimprisonment.   Yacoub, 32, was ordered held in custody pending another hearingMonday.   Police said Yacoub hijacked the bus in Montreal, diverted it toOttawa and held police at bay for eight hours, saying he haddynamite. The bus had veered and stopped on the lawn outside thecenter of Canadian government.   The hijacking ended peacefully and without injuries Fridayevening, and Canadian police said the hostages were flown to NewYork at Greyhound expense.   CTV television quoted security forces as saying the gunman wasdemanding Syrian troops withdraw from Lebanon and free allprisoners. Syria sent troops into Lebanon as a peacekeeping forceafter the civil war between Lebanese Moslems and Christians eruptedin 1975.   Henry Jensen, deputy commissioner of the Royal CanadianMMounties, said Yacoub emigrated to Canada from Lebanon in 1976.   Police said he identified himself as acting on behalf of theFront for the Liberation of Christian Lebanon, a group thatauthorities were not sure existed.   The incident posed questions about government security. Quebecprovincial police alerted U.S. border authorities but not securityforces in neighboring Ontario.   The hijacker released the first hostage, an elderly man, at theChamplain Bridge just outside of Montreal before heading on toOttawa, 100 miles to the west.   Police said the hijacker told the hostage:``You're going to getoff here _ everything is going to blow up.''   Three female hostages and one man were released in the first fewhours of the Ottawa standoff, and the male driver left the vehiclejust before the hijacking came to an end. Police briefly checkedthe final five hostages before concluding they were not involvedwith the hijacker.   No explosives were found.   The red-white-and-blue bus, which left deep ruts in the usuallyimmaculate lawns of Parliament Hill, was towed to a police garageSaturday.</TEXT></DOC>
