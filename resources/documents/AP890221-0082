The court, without comment, rejected arguments that MarvinGorman's suit against Swaggart and others unconstitutionallyentangles Louisiana state courts in matters of church doctrine anddiscipline.   Gorman was a pastor of the First Assembly of God Church in NewOrleans when Swaggart accused him of ``immoral dalliances'' withseveral women.   Gorman resigned from his ministry a day after a July 1986 meetingof church leaders in which Swaggart aired his allegations and Gormanadmitted to one instance of immoral conduct.   Swaggart and other Assembly of God officials did not considerGorman's resignation valid, however, and he was formally dismissedonly after the accusations were read to his congregation.   In February 1988, Swaggart himself tearfully confessed to anundisclosed sin. A New Orleans prostitute later said Swaggart paidher to perform sex acts while he watched.   Swaggart was defrocked by the Assemblies of God last April 8after refusing to step down from the pulpit for at least a year.   He returned to his ministry's Family Worship Center in BatonRouge, La., and resumed his television programs. But the fortunes ofJimmy Swaggart World Ministries have not recovered fully from the1987 scandal.   Last month, Penthouse magazine published an article in which aNew Orleans stripper told about performing sexual acts for Swaggart.   Calling her story ``diabolical and slanderous fiction,'' Swaggarthas threatened to sue the magazine. He also said his televisionministry would end this month unless he received enough donations toovercome ``pornographers'' who are trying to sabbotage hisbroadcasts.   Penthouse said the stripper, Catherine Mary Kampen, detailed thealleged relationship with Swaggart in a deposition for lawyersrepresenting Gorman in his lawsuit against Swaggart and others.   Gorman contends, among other things, that he was defamed andlibeled by Swaggart.   Swaggart and the 13 other defendants sought to have Gorman's suitdismissed, arguing that it violates religious freedoms for courts topreside over disputes stemming from church discipline.   ``The secular courts are without jurisdiction to hear hisclaim,'' lawyers for Swaggart contended.   The cases are Swaggart vs. Adler, 88-1080, and Treeby vs. Gorman,88-1058.</TEXT></DOC>
