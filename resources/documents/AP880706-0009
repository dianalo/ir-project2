The department's Agricultural Research Service reportedWednesday that the two enzymes in corn and other plants help limitstress from heat and drought. The enzymes seem to work best``within a temperature range we call a thermal kinetic window.''   Researchers said that when the plant's temperature rises abovethe window, its ability to fight heat stress starts to fade. Andwhen there is a lack of water for use by the plant's naturalcooling system, the enzymes become less effective and the plantwithers and dies.   The enzymes identified by agency scientists in Lubbock, Texas,are glutathione reductase, which stops the buildup of potentiallylethal waste products as a plant fights heat stress, andhydroxypyruvate reductase, which is thought to protectphotosynthesis, or the plant's food-making process, during stress.   Jerry L. Hatfield, a research leader at the laboratory, saidthermal kinetic windows vary by plant species and are much narrowerthan expected. For example, corn has a window in a range of 77 to88 degrees Fahrenheit; cucumbers, 93 to 100; wheat, 62 to 73;spinach, 50 to 63; and cotton 73 to 90.   Hatfield said USDA plant physiologists John J. Burke and JamesR. Mahan were the first to analyze the activity of the enzymes atdifferent temperatures.   One of the goals of the research is to transfer one plant'sgenes for controlling an enzyme's behavior into other plants,thereby producing crops that are more tolerant to heat, drought andother stresses than they otherwise would be, Hatfield said in areport issued here.   ``Although such advances may be a long way off, they could leadto crops better equipped to face such climatic changes as thegradual heating that may occur from the buildup of carbon dioxidein the earth's atmosphere,'' he said.   Meanwhile, a report by the government's Joint AgriculturalWeather Facility said rain and cooler weather in the week of June27 to July 3 ``eased drought stress in the Great Plains, Delta andwestern Corn Belt'' but that ``the lack of moisture worsened inmost Corn Belt states.''   Overall, the corn crop was in ``still mostly fair-to-poor''condition, the report said.   An estimated 96 percent of the nation's soybeans had beenplanted by July 3, slightly behind the normal pace. The crop wasreported in ``mostly fair'' condition in the Great Plains andSoutheast but were said to be ``mostly poor'' in the Delta states.   ``Cooler temperatures eased livestock stress,'' the report said.``Ranchers continued culling herds as forage supplies decreased.Producers provided supplemental feed in most areas. Pastures weremostly poor and showed very little regrowth.''</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Soviet Union has come back into the U.S.corn market for the first time in three months to buy 175,000metric tons for delivery this year under a long-term supplyagreement between the two countries, says the AgricultureDepartment.   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushelsof corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 175,000 tons ofcorn would be about 6.9 million bushels.   Corn prices have been averaging about $2.80 per bushel at thefarm level, meaning that the sale could have a farm value of around$19 million.   Prices have shot up recently, reflecting damage to this year'scrop. On March 31, the last time the Soviets bought a significantamount of U.S. corn, the farm price was about $1.90 per bushel.   The corn purchase announced Wednesday is part of the grain theSoviet Union is committed to buy during the fifth and final year ofthe agreement, which calls for the annual purchase of at least 9million tons of U.S. grain. The pact expires Sept. 30, and therehave been negotiations for a new one.   According to the agreement, the annual purchases are supposed toinclude a minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and corn. TheSoviets have the option of buying the remaining 1 million tons aswheat, corn or soybeans, with every ton of beans counting as twotons of grain _ up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grainequivalent.   With the latest purchases, the Soviets now have bought 4.36million tons of corn, plus more than 9 million tons of wheat;830,700 tons of soybeans; and 1.3 million tons of soybean meal.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Farmers in designated drought areas who donateall the hay cut from land in two conservation programs will nothave their federal acreage payments reduced by the AgricultureDepartment.   Previously, farmers who harvested hay from land enrolled in theConservation Reserve Program, or CRP, and the Water Bank Program,or WBP, would have their annual payments reduced by 25 percent thefollowing year.   Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng said Wednesday that to beeligible for the exemption, a producer must donate the hay througha designated state agency engaged in drought-relief efforts andobtain certification from an official of the agency that the hayhas been donated properly.   More than 1,800 counties have been designated by USDA as droughtareas eligible for the special haying privileges.   Under the two programs, farmers enroll land for 10 years andagree not to produce crops on it. They are required to plantprotective grasses or trees to prevent erosion and are paid annualrental fees by the government for maintaining the acreage.   Typically, the fees average $40 to $50 per acre annually. Thus,without the exemption, hay donated to help other farmers wouldresult in a loss of $10 or more per year in federal payments.</TEXT></DOC>
