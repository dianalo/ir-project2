Garcia</HL><DD> 06/29/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)STOCK INDEXES (NDX) </IN><TEXT>   Expectations are running high on Wall Street that higher corporate profits will fuel a rise in stock prices that will keep them at record levels for many months to come.    But some analysts warn that investors' expectations may be running too high, pumped up by wildly positive earnings results in the first quarter. They believe the stock market might be vulnerable to disappointments in the next few weeks, as second-quarter results are released, if the actual reports don't surpass expectations.    &quot;It's hard to envision that earnings across the board will exceed the already high expectations that we are now seeing,&quot; says Jeffrey Applegate, an investment strategist with E.F. Hutton in New York.    According to Institutional Brokers Estimate System, a service of Lynch Jones andamp; Ryan that monitors Wall Street analysts' earnings estimates, upward revisions in estimates exceeded reductions during the month from mid-April to mid-May. That's the first time it's happened in nearly seven years, says Stan Levine of IBES. From mid-May to mid-June, upward and downward revisions were even.    Another problem for the stock market is that the rate of earnings growth will decelerate significantly next year after peaking in the fourth quarter. Since stock prices tend to be a leading indicator, the stock market's advance could stall well before corporate profit growth slows, analysts caution.    Nonetheless, earnings growth is still expected to be robust through this year.    A clear picture of the profit outlook might be gleaned by looking at the earnings estimates for the companies in Standard andamp; Poor's 400-stock index, which doesn't include financial, transportation or utility stocks. This outlook isn't distorted by the move by most money center banks to increase their loan-loss reserves because of concern about risky Third World loans.    Earnings for the Sandamp;P 500-index, which includes banks, will be depressed a bit because beefing up reserves has created losses for many of the banks for the second quarter and the entire year.    Analysts are looking for Sandamp;P 400 per-share earnings to rise between 20% and 25% for the quarter. For the entire year, earnings are expected to be up more than 30%.    Several factors are contributing to the robust earnings growth expected this year: fewer non-recurring write-offs; sharp improvement in profit margins because of cost reductions and restructuring; refinancing of corporate debt at lower interest rates; and a lower dollar, which boosted earnings for multinationals and stimulated export sales.    The positive impact of some of these factors will be diminishing throughout next year, accounting for the anticipated slower growth in earnings in 1988.    Arnie Kaufman, editor of Sandamp;P Outlook newsletter, says the U.S. dollar is likely to be 10% higher in the next 12 months, so its impact on earnings and the trade scene will be reduced. Merrill Lynch economists also say that wage costs, after being held in check in 1987, will be higher next year and will cause profit margins to shrink.    John Connolly, a market strategist with Dean Witter Reynolds, warns that this bull market could run out of steam sooner than most expect. The stock market does look quite far ahead and will discount a slowdown in earnings well before they actually peak, he says.    But it doesn't always work that way. Sometimes, he adds, &quot;The stock market doesn't look beyond its nose.&quot;    ---   Friday's Market Activity   Stock prices retreated on a lower U.S. dollar and weaker bond prices. Some investors took profits on recent stock gainers; others just walked away from the market.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 14.19 points to 2436.86 after setting a record Thursday. The broader stock market indexes also lost ground. Declining issues on the New York Stock Exchange had a 9-to-5 lead over gainers as volume contracted to 150.5 million shares from 173.5 million Thursday.    While some investors zeroed in on some paper, forest products, chemical, drug and technology stocks for profit-taking, others focused on stocks of companies involved in actual takeover deals or rumored ones.    JWT Group gained 2 1/4 to 55 1/8 after agreeing to be acquired by WPP Group for $55.50 a share.    Dayton Hudson rose 1 to 51. Takeover speculation continues despite a tough anti-takeover bill adopted by the Minnesota legislature late Thursday.    Gillette added 3/8 to 39 7/8 in heavy trading on reports that Revlon Group is considering boosting its offer to between $41 and $45 a share.    A.H. Robins moved up 1 1/2 to 26 1/2. The company received a second merger offer from Rorer Group. </TEXT></DOC>
