The images were computed in 81 patients on the base of theCT data. 3-D views provided essentially the same diagnostic informationas the conventional CT images but in a more useful form. The conditionsare more apparent and the relationship between normal and abnormal structuresis more easily understood. From this point of view, 3-D imaging makesit possible to improve communication between the radiologist and theattending physician.</TEXT></DOC>
