The figures run counter to trends that many economists see in both sectors, however. Analysts generally expect rising exports to push factory orders up in coming months, while high vacancy rates and increased interest rates restrain construction.    The drop in orders, which reflected a sharp decline in aircraft and parts as well as weakness in food, textiles and paper products, followed a revised 0.3% rise in July. The July figure was originally reported as a 0.2% decline.    &quot;Don't overdo the weakness in this number,&quot; cautioned Douglas Cliggott, senior economist at Merrill Lynch Economics Inc. in New York. &quot;We've had several months of solid increases and we're still at a high level from a year ago. It's hard to see the weakness in that.&quot;    The August decline in orders left them 9.4% above August 1986.    Richard Peterson, senior vice president at Continental Illinois National Bank in Chicago, called the August drop an aberration, although he said orders aren't likely to continue increasing at the pace they had until last month.    Orders for nondefense capital goods, considered a good indicator of business investment, plunged 8.1% in August after rising 6.7% in July. Mr. Cliggott and Mr. Peterson both said this drop also masks strength in the capital goods area.    The report showed less weakness in orders for durable goods than was indicated in the department's advance report last week. Orders for durable goods, which are designed to last three years or more, fell 2.7% in August after being unchanged in July. Previously the August drop was reported as 3.1%.    Orders for nondurable goods fell 0.6% in August after a 0.6% rise in July.    Factory orders in August totaled $202.53 billion, down from $206.07 billion in July. Shipments rose 0.3% in August to $199.96 billion after falling 0.6% in July to $199.4 billion.    Manufacturers' inventories increased 0.5% to $325.11 billion after a 0.5% rise in July to $323.33 billion. The backlog of unfilled orders rose 0.7% to $394.46 billion after a 1.7% increase to $391.89 billion. August marked the sixth consecutive monthly increase in unfilled orders.    The rise in construction spending brought outlays in August to an annual rate of $399.6 billion after a 0.1% July drop to a $393.4 billion pace. Nonresidential spending rose 2.6% after declining 0.2%. Residential construction rose 1.4% after a 1.5% decline.    Mr. Peterson, however, said &quot;the trend for nonresidential and residential spending is downward.&quot; He predicted that high vacancy rates in some areas and the continued effect of tax-law changes would hurt nonresidential and apartment construction, and that higher interest rates would slow single-family homebuilding.    Total private construction increased 1.7% in August after a 0.4% drop in July. Outlays for public building increased 0.9% after a 1.2% rise. Overall, August outlays were 1.1% above a year earlier.    Measured in 1982 dollars to remove the effects of inflation, construction spending rose 1.3% from July and was down 1.8% from a year earlier.    The figures in both reports are adjusted for seasonal variation.    Here are the Commerce Department's figures for construction spending in billions of dollars at seasonally adjusted annual rates.                                         Aug.
