A semi-automatic computer program was designed to definethe left ventricular myocardial volume in all short axis sections. Withinthis volume the relative mean myocardial pixel count was calculated.This parameter was found to separate the 2 patient groups with a sensitivityof at least 81% at a specificity of 100%.</TEXT></DOC>
