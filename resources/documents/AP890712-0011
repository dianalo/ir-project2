Israeli officials are warning with increasing bluntness that theyare prepared to use whatever force is necessary to protect the farmsand towns nestled along the 100-mile border.   Speaking on Israel's Arabic language TV program, the government'scoordinator for Lebanon policy suggested Israel would not feelhampered by U.S. urgings or other restraints.   ``We strike anywhere we see there is a potential danger forsubversive action against our northern border .... We will strikewithout taking into account any unrelated interests,'' said theofficial, Uri Lubrani.   Brig. Gen. Nehemiya, commander of troops in the north, suggestedduring a visit to a frontier army base that pre-emptive strikeswould keep Palestinians from taking the initiative and prevent theirrebuilding.   ``If we feel any organization is preparing an operation againstIsrael, it's better to prevent it than wait for them on theborder,'' he said. Under army regulations, Nehemiya's last name andthe location of the army base could not be used.   Recently, Israeli troops have been moving out of Israel'sself-declared security zone, a two- to 12-mile strip on the Lebaneseside of the border. In one clash, three Palestinian guerrillas werekilled.   The strip was originally carved out as a six- to 10-mile-widebuffer zone in 1985 when Israel withdrew the bulk of its 1982invading force, but current Israeli army and U.N. maps show changesin the borders of the strip.   Northern commander Maj. Gen. Yossi Peled, said one aim of theraids was to convince residents not to cooperate with groups hostileto Israel.   Israel must ``deter the residents so they will at least not allowforces to act within their villages because they will be the firstto suffer,'' Peled said on Israel radio.   In another operation, the army and allied South Lebanon Armymilitiamen supported by tanks and artillery staged a show of forcein a zone controlled by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah militia, whichIsraeli officials say is helping Palestinians in attacks on Israel.   Israel's air force has also launched eight air raids in Lebanonthis year, most against Syrian-backed Palestinian groups. Halfoccurred in the past six weeks, including one on the Rashadiyerefugee camp only 10 miles north of the border.   Western diplomats fear escalation could lead to rocketbombardment from south Lebanon or cross-border terror attacks whichcould result in major civilian bloodshed.   That in turn could harden Israeli public opinion and stymieefforts to arrange negotiations with Palestinians, especially whensuch efforts appear on the verge of collapse.   ``The peace process can be easily sabotaged. All it would take isfor a guerrilla to get two katyushas and a donkey to carry them. Ifby chance the rockets hit a school, that would be it,'' said adiplomat with long experience in Lebanon who spoke on condition ofanonymity.   Since Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafatrenounced terrorism and accepted Israel in December, his Fatahguerrillas have not attemped any attacks on Israel.   But more radical groups, both inside and outside the PLOframework, have mounted raids, which appeared aimed in part atdisrupting the peace efforts.   Brig. Gen. Nehemiya said that while the frontier with Syria waspotentially the most worrisome, the Lebanon border ``is the mostdangerous border we have now.''   ``The main threat is that Palestinian guerrilla groups will crossthe border and come to the settlements here, either to kill or totake hostages and negotiate the release of prisoners.''   There has been a long history of terror raids prior to Israel's1982-85 war in Lebanon. In one of the bloodiest attacks, athree-member Palestinian squad crossed from Lebanon and killed 24civilians, mostly children, in Maalot in 1974.   ``I am pleased that in the past three years no civilians havebeen killed, but I can't promise it won't happen again,'' saidNehemiya.   He said about 50 attempts occurred since the start of thePalestinian uprising in December, 1987. Only about one in fourgroups reached the electronic fence but none succeeded since aPalestinian in a hang glider killed eight soldiers in northernIsraeli in November 1987.   According to unofficial count, 29 Palestinians were killed and 17captured in attempted border raids in 1988 and 25 have been killedand two wounded so far this year.   Sources in south Lebanon who demanded anonymity confirmed arecent report published in London by Jane's Defense Weekly that saidArafat was building a new ``Palestinian army'' force in refugeecamps near the south Lebanon city of Sidon.   The purpose is to create a cohesive, better-trained force of2,000 to 3,000 fighters who would act more like an army and be loyalto Arafat. Now, about 7,000 to 8,000 fighters in the area areorganized into militias loyal to various Palestinian factions.   ``For sure, Israel will not let them rebuild,'' said Nehemiya.</TEXT></DOC>
