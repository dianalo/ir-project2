 Such devices, which added to their personalities, have been includedin science fiction films and books almost compulsorily, they are a seeminglyessential ingredient in our perception of future machines.andP;  And computersthat can respond to speech have the potential to achieve the ultimate in userfriendliness - because people can pretend that they're not really machines atall.andP;  But current speech recognition computers bear little resemblance to theintelligent machines of the science fiction world.andP;  There are a range ofspeech recognition computers on the market, but unlike the fictitious ones,current systems do not understand speech as a communication system, but onlyas an alternative to keyed or written entries and commands.andM;SurgeryandM;Computers that recognise speech are therefore generally used in highlystructured applications.andP;  Usual applications are in areas where the userneeds both hands to perform tasks, while entering data simultaneously.andP;  Thistype of data entry application is used in areas such as quality control,equipment repair and record keeping by medical staff during surgery.andP;  GECPlc's Marconi Speech Information Systems has been in the speech business for20 years, originally as a division of Marconi Secure Radio.andP;  In January lastyear Marconi's Talkman machine was launched.andP;  The Talkman is similar in sizeand look to a portable cassette player, it also has headphones and is carriedlike one.andP;  The machine can recognise a maximum of 1,000 words and like mostmachines running commercial applications, is speaker-dependent.andP;  This meansit can only recognise the voices of people that have run through the requiredvocabulary, with each user having to provide two samples of each word.andO;However, the user can speak continuously - some systems require speakers toseparate words with noticeable pauses.andP;  Talkman is designed for use as aquality control device in factories and warehouses, leaving the inspector'shands and eyes free to inspect.andP;  As well as recording data, the user canspeak 11 commands, such as &quot;continue&quot; and &quot;help&quot;, and the machine will alsoprompt the user - using synthesized speech - to provide more specificinformation to pinpoint the problem.andM;By Sonya McGilchristandM;Software is MS-DOS-compatible, enabling data to be downloaded to a personalcomputer for further manipulation.andP;  Marconi has sold one Talkman system sofar, and has orders for six more.andP;  Marconi has also come up with a voicerecognition board for personal computers, which translates spoken words todata input.andP;  The board has an 800 word vocabulary, and is designed for addingto various software systems where the user needs both hands free.andO;Essentially, the board is added to existing software packages, enablingspoken data input or menu driving.andP;  The company has already teamed up withCybernetic Concept to add the speech facility to the latter's Odontologpackage for dentists, so they can enter data and look up patient recordswhile peering into mouths.andP;  But all this, although exciting, is a far cryfrom the R2D2 type of machine.andP;  And a report from New Science Associatessuggests that speech recognition technology is beginning to reach maturityfor commercial purposes.andP;  New Science is an Irvine, California-based marketresearch and consultancy firm, specialising in advanced areas of computing.andO;Its report says that commercial systems with unlimited vocabulary size,speaker independence - so that anyone can use the system without having totrain the machine - and continuous speech, should be achieved in the&quot;not-to-distant future&quot;.andP;  But for that &quot;not-to-distant future&quot; these systemsare likely to remain as devices that mimick keyboard and mouse activities,rather than specifically-designed speech products in their own right.andP;  Wordprocessors and personal computers with a spoken command front-end are beingworked on according to the firm's London based John Dring, but they remainfor the moment firmly in the research laboratories of companies such as IBMand speech research centres in academic institutions.andP;  And New Sciencebelieves that these types of machines are not really the aim of speechrecognition technology.andP;  Nina Buck says that as far as commercialapplications go, the goal of speech recognition is to produce an accurate,speaker-independent product with a large vocabulary and the ability toprocess continuous speech, plus a limited intelligence capability.andP;  Suchmachines would have a limited understanding of of the application area, sothat it could put speech input in context and take its knowledge of thesubject into account when processing that input.andM;TiresomeandM;This is the approach of natural language processing, comprehending themeaning, structure and context of language, rather than interpreting thesignal only.andP;  But Ms Buck reckons that it is the coming together of theseveral technologies, the linguistic natural processing approach, with theengineering-based neural networks technology and artificial intelligence thatwill lead to a breakthrough and a new generation of speech recognitionmachines.andP;  When these developments are made - and Ms Buck says we are on thebrink of it now - and converted into saleable products they will beenormously attractive.andP;  However, Ms Buck believes that they will complementand not replace keyboard- or pen-driven computers.andP;  Future applications, shesays, will probably remain in the factory floor areas, because she reckonsthat talking into a machine for eight hours a day could get tiresome.andP;  Shedid admit though that systems for executives with keyboard-phobia or forpeople that use their computers for a limited amount of time a day mightcatch on.andP;  But as for a personifed computer, one to which you can talknaturally, and which will take it all in and even answer back? John Dring ofNew Science Associates has a clear reaction, &quot;don't ever expect a computer tobe human&quot; - at least &quot;not in our lifetime&quot;.andP;  That's a relief, isn't it.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
