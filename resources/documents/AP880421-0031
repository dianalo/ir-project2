The unusual alliance of consumer advocates and insurancesalesmen concluded in a study released Wednesday that only fourinsurance departments _ those in Florida, New York, Vermont and theVirgin Islands _ spend enough to meet its standard.   All of the other 43 governments surveyed need to spend more oftheir insurance premium tax collections to improve the industry,said the Consumer Insurance Interest Group.   The group recommended that 10 percent of insurance tax premiumsbe used to support state insurance commissions. The average foundin the survey is 5.37 percent, down from 7 percent in 1985.   The group, set up and funded by the National Association ofProfessional Insurance Agents (PIA) with longtime consumer advocateEsther Peterson as chairwoman, hopes to convince states to regulatethe industry more closely.   Insurance agents and most major insurance companies want this,because they want to weed out insolvent companies, said PIAPresident-elect David L. Ream of Cleveland, Ohio, at a newsconference with other officials involved in the survey.   The survey says states receive an ``overwhelming'' average of23,000 complaints a year, but two-thirds of the departmentssurveyed don't even have written procedures for handling thecomplaints.   Many log complaints manually without computers, the survey says.   ``Some states lack basic computer systems to deal with themassive amounts of information,'' said J. Robert Hunter, NationalInsurance Consumer Organization president and a member of thesurvey group. ``The insurance industry is one of the mostsophisticated users of computer technology, yet some insurancedepartments are lacking the basics in automation.''   The study recommends a group be formed by the NationalAssociation of Insurance Commissioners to develop guidelines foreach state department to follow in handling complaints.   Ms. Peterson, a consumer specialist for Presidents Lyndon B.Johnson and Jimmy Carter, is PIA's consumer adviser.   She said the study of 44 states, the District of Columbia,Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands represents a breakthrough inrelations beteen consumer advocates and one part of the insuranceindustry. Six states' departments did not respond to the initialsurvey sent in September 1987 and were not included in the study.   PIA president Willis J. Hargrave Jr. of Houston, Texas, said thestudy found state insurance commissions are more effective than inthe past but have failed to keep pace with the industry.   Other major conclusions of the report were:   _Many departments lack personnel and resources to properlyregulate insurers. The study recommends enough personnel forfinancial examinations of each insurance company at least onceevery three years, which is currently done by less than half thestates.   _State governments allocate an average of less thansix-one-hundredths of a percent of their budgets to insuranceregulation, although the average consumer spends 15 percent of hisdisposable income on insurance.   _Salaries of insurance department professionals are far belowcomparable salaries in the private sector and slightly below thoseholding comparable jobs in other branches of state government. Thestudy recommends a salary audit every two years.   The survey showed annual salaries of state insurancecommissioners ranging from $33,342 in Montana to $85,656 inFlorida, and average examiner salaries varied from $14,682 inPuerto Rico to $69,875 in Kentucky.   _States need more actuaries and consumer professionals involvedin regulating the industry. The survey recommends that each statehire at least one of each.</TEXT></DOC>
