Several of those accused already have agreed to cooperate with federal investigators, and over 100 may eventually be indicted.    ---   Falconbridge of Toronto agreed to be acquired by Amax in a transaction valued at $2.42 billion. The takeover will make Amax one of the world's biggest base-metal producers.    ---   Avon Products will consider today a $41 a share, or $2.85 billion, takeover offer from Irwin Jacobs.

Analysts said the report indicated continued weakness in the industrial sector though not a recession.    ---   Rates on fixed mortgages are approaching two-year lows of 9.25% to 9.5%, with further declines expected. The recent drop in rates has sparked modest increases in house sales.    ---   Texaco and Exxon were ordered to pay over $2 billion in back taxes and interest for oil bought at below-market prices as long as a decade ago. Both plan to fight the claim.    ---   The Senate passed an $885 million disaster-relief package to help farmers who've had significant crop losses to drought and flooding this year.    ---   The Princeton/Newport jury decided that the six defendants must forfeit $3.8 million in assets, far less than the government sought. But the judge may increase the amount.    ---   Integrated Resources turned over the chairman's post to Stephen Weinroth, a top officer of the company's investment bank, Drexel.    ---   RJR Nabisco posted a 24% jump in operating profit from its core businesses for the second quarter. The company had a net loss of $309 million due to interest and debt expenses.    ---   Siemens and GEC are expected to revive their long-stalled bid for Plessey after clearing the last regulatory hurdle in Britain for the takeover.    ---   Stocks and the dollar rose and bonds fell as investors awaited tomorrow's report on July employment.    ---   Markets --    Stocks: Volume 181,760,000 shares.
