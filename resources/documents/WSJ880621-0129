The 30-year-old Iranian fled his country in 1982, crossing the border into Turkey to evade pursuit by the forces of Ayatollah Ruholloh Khomeini. On Sunday he went back, crossing an embattled stretch of Iraqi border southeast of Baghdad, the Iraqi capital, following the army of his dissident Iranian political group, the People's Mujahedeen.    The mujahedeen forces, known as the National Liberation Army, said they gained possession of the Iranian village of Mehran and the surrounding heights in a battle that began early Sunday morning. The claim by the NLA, the most active of several Iranian opposition groups, that it took Mehran without Iraqi help couldn't be confirmed.    In the village, a much-shelled collection of mud-brick ruins long since abandoned by civilians, uniformed mujahedeen sat atop tanks and armored personnel carriers, waving banners and chanting in Farsi: &quot;Today Mehran, tomorrow Tehran.&quot;    The mujahedeen claim to have killed, wounded or captured thousands of Iranians in the battle. &quot;This is Khomeini's biggest defeat since the beginning of the war,&quot; said Mr. Parvin, a mujahedeen spokesman.    But a visit to the captured town provided little evidence to back up such assertions. Journalists taken to the village soon after its capture saw only four bodies and one injured Iranian soldier from the Khomeini forces. Physical signs of a recent battle in the town itself were slight.    While the mujahedeen said the heavy fighting took place in the surrounding mountains, they declined to take observers to the battlefield, citing safety concerns.    (The Associated Press quoted the National Liberation Army as saying its anti-aircraft guns downed a U.S.-made Iranian gunship helicopter near Mehran yesterday. The AP also noted that Mehran has changed hands more than five times since the Iran-Iraq war began in 1980.)    Mehran isn't a strategic site: The mountains behind the town make significant advances into Iranian territory impossible, while Iranians invading Iraqi territory here would have to cross miles of sandy, flat and easily defensible wasteland.    Nevertheless, the foray into Iranian territory is an important symbolic victory for the mujahedeen, which formed its army only a year ago. &quot;It wouldn't add up to anything if it was an Iraqi victory, but for the National Liberation Army it's something to trumpet about,&quot; said a Western diplomat based in Baghdad. &quot;Half the war they're fighting -- perhaps more than half -- is trying to keep their flag flying in Iran.&quot;    The leftist Moslem group opposed the shah and helped Ayatollah Khomeini, only to become a target of his crackdown on dissent. It won't disclose the size of its army, and independent estimates vary widely. But Western analysts in Iraq say the force consists of at least several thousand well-equipped and highly motivated troops. The mujahedeen says one-third of its soldiers are women.    Soheila Mayehzabeh was a fourth-year pharmacy student at the University of Arizona until she joined the National Liberation Army 2 1/2 months ago. Wearing the women's uniform of khaki headscarf and thigh-length tunic over fatigues, she stood guard in Mehran's main street.    &quot;Khomeini's idea is that women were only created to help men,&quot; said the 22-year-old Iranian. &quot;I'm here to show that it isn't unbelievable for a woman to fight for her country.&quot;    Independent analysts do find some mujahedeen claims hard to believe, especially the group's assertion that its military links with the Iraqis are limited to occasional coordination. The mujahedeen says its well-stocked armory is either funded by Iranian expatriates or supplied by captured Iranian materiel. No funds or weapons are supplied by Iraq, it says.    Iran's offical news service claimed the Mehran attack was carried out by an &quot;Iraqi-backed guerrilla army&quot; and that Iranian forces engaged in a heavy battle with Iraqi forces northeast of Mehran, during which Iraqi jets dropped chemical bombs. Iraq denied the report.    But even if mujahedeen participation &quot;was only show,&quot; said the Western diplomat, &quot;it's a very impressive show. They march in step, they've got nice uniforms -- it isn't a great mental leap to think they perform well in the field against uneducated and probably unwilling {Iranian boy soldiers}.&quot; Indeed, journalists taken to Mehran were presented with indications of flagging Iranian morale.    &quot;Some of us haven't had leave in three months and we're being kept here by force,&quot; said Amid Azimi, 25 years old, one of several dozen prisoners shown off by the mujahedeen. &quot;We're very happy we've been captured by the mujahedeen,&quot; said Mr. Azimi, speaking through a mujahedeen interpreter, &quot;because now we know we'll stay alive and see our families again. Only 7% -- something like that -- of the soldiers here still believe in what we're supposed to be fighting for.&quot;    In a pile of documents found at a captured Iranian outpost, Mr. Parvin, the mujahedeen spokesman, found a letter to an officer written by a friend stationed at another front. &quot;I'm all right altogether, thank God. Don't mention that I don't believe all this ruin is going to end or that I'll ever be free from it,&quot; Mr. Parvin read.    The soldier asked his friend to notice the &quot;joke&quot; on the letter's envelope. A slogan below the address read: &quot;War, war until victory.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
