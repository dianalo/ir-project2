On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the September contract forWest Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil,fell 18 cents to close at $18.12 a 42-gallon barrel after tradingas high as $18.64.   The near-term contract last closed lower on Feb. 24, at a priceof $18.07 a barrel. Contracts for later delivery had slightlysmaller losses.   Among refined products traded on the exchange, unleaded gasolinefor August delivery fell 0.64 cent to finish at 51.98 cents agallon. The September contract closed even lower at 51.01 cents agallon, down 0.83 cent.   Domestic heating oil for delivery in August closed 0.23 centlower at 49.26 cents a gallon, while contracts for later deliverythis year recorded bigger declines.   Crude prices have fallen steadily since early last week,pressured by falling gasoline prices and rising crude oilproduction in the face of slackening demand.   Although statistics from the American Petroleum Institute showedan overall decline in crude oil supplies, analysts said there was abuildup in some key areas, including the Gulf of Mexico.   ``There was almost a 4 million barrel build in the Gulf Coast,''said John Hill, energy analyst with Merrill Lynch Energy Futures.``There was a big draw on the West Coast, but the Gulf Coast iswhere most of the refiners are. Frankly, people are saying thatthere's lots of crude oil out there.''   In addition, an estimate this week put OPEC production at morethan 21.2 million barrels per day, higher than the 19.5 millionbarrel quota the cartel set for the second half of 1989.   Gasoline prices have softened recently, reflecting what someanalysts say is consumer reaction to the surge in prices at theretail pump.</TEXT></DOC>
