Democrats are determined to at least match Mr. Bush dollar for dollar on the drug issue, and House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt signaled that defense commitments in the budget summit agreement of last spring are now open to change. &quot;Last night put a new light on things,&quot; said the Missouri Democrat in reference to Mr. Bush's national television address. Republicans acknowledged the White House hurt itself by failing to put forward a more complete list of savings to offset the new program costs.    The $716 million in new spending proposed this week is only part of $1.48 billion added by the administration this year to its initial fiscal 1990 budget for fighting drugs -- now totaling nearly $7.9 billion. Offsetting cuts proposed by the Office of Management and Budget would cover only half the increases proposed since February, and in several cases, the savings appear exaggerated.    While speaking in terms of &quot;war,&quot; the administration rejects new revenues and is even shy of challenging the pork-barrel amendments of House and Senate Appropriations committees. For example, the budget office suggests trims of $90 million from public housing and juvenile justice programs, while making no mention of offsetting cuts from costly highway projects or academic buildings sponsored by members.    The largest single reduction, said to be $320 million, would come from federal aid to states providing social services to new immigrants -- money the administration admits may never be spent in any case.    &quot;Trust and later verify,&quot; joked House Speaker Thomas Foley. And with the new fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, the fight will be compressed in the appropriations process currently under way. The first shot was fired when senators pressed yesterday to shift at least $45 million from lawmakers' mail expenses to drug-treatment programs, and the debate will be fully joined next week when the Senate Appropriations Committee takes up the revised Justice Department budget.    Absent a waiver, it will be impossible for most lawmakers to accommodate the new spending requested by the president under the allocations established by the budget. But Sen. Warren Rudman (R., N.H.), one of the original sponsors of the Gramm-Rudman deficit law, said he would consider voting for at least a temporary waiver to bring the matter to the floor, where offsetting cuts would have to be found. While Republicans expect further reductions from the military budget, these won't be easily achieved. The next few weeks promise a rough-and-tumble fight with the GOP countering by using the drug issue to push for cuts in domestic programs. &quot;It will strip some old wallpaper,&quot; says Republican Whip Alan Simpson of Wyoming.    The administration, meanwhile, yesterday launched an aggressive campaign to sell the president's plan in speeches and briefings.    At a White House news conference, Louis Sullivan, secretary of the Health and Human Services Department, said that under the Bush plan, the government would create 210,000 to 360,000 new slots to treat drug addicts during the next year. That seems unlikely given the amount the president proposes to add to the treatment budget -- $321 million -- and the prolonged process by which federal money moves from Washington to state and local treatment programs, according to experts in the field.    Even at the low end of that projection, Mr. Sullivan estimates new treatment slots would cost about $1,530 each -- &quot;lower than you can do outpatient methadone treatment, which is the cheapest kind there is,&quot; said Karst Besteman, executive director of the Alcohol and Drug Problems Association, a Washington advocacy group.    In a separate session with reporters, the White House director of drug policy scolded Democratic critics who have called for more spending than the president's $7.9 billion proposal. Drug czar William Bennett said that amount was almost $2 billion more than what Congress has agreed to spend in fiscal 1990. In fact, however, it was President Bush who in February proposed to spend $5.96 billion on anti-drug programs next fiscal year. </TEXT></DOC>
