In one spot, an uptight housewife hosts &quot;TheIroning Show.&quot; In another, smarmy talk-show host &quot;PenPendleton&quot; examines &quot;accountants who dress like clowns -- andthe women who love them.&quot;   The funniest thing about the ads, though, is theirsponsor: TV Guide, which makes a living listing real-lifeshows that are often even worse.</LP><TEXT>   In a bold step, News Corp.'s TV Guide is throwing $20million behind the first major consumer effort it has evermounted. The campaign, created by its new ad agency,Chiat/Day/Mojo, makes its debut this weekend.   It will be one of the largest consumer magazine campaignsin memory. People magazine, for example, spent just $9million in advertising last year, while Time shelled out lessthan $6 million, according to Leading National Advertisers.   TV Guide needs to spend big if it is to turn around itssliding circulation and advertising. The TV bible has seenits franchise steadily eroded by Sunday newspapersupplements, which are beefing up their own TV listings. Forthe first nine months of this year, paid circulation fell 3%,to 15.4 million, while advertising pages plunged by 20%,according to Publishers Information Bureau.   The new campaign attempts to battle the competitionhead-on. Each ad shows a spoof of an undeniably awful TVshow, then cuts to an actual TV Guide listing describing ahot show in detail. The message: Competing listings don'tgive enough details to flag the shows people are going totalk about tomorrow -- and you may end up humiliated andmiserable when it turns out you were watching dreck, instead.   The Ironing Lady from Hell, for example, is followed by aclose-up of a listing for NBC's &quot;Cheers.&quot; Booms an announcer:&quot;What were you watching when Sam and Rebecca finally did iton Cheers?&quot;   The talk-show spoof (&quot;The clown inside me had been thereall along, struggling to come out,&quot; a Bozo clone confesses)is followed in one incarnation by a listing for ABC'snow-defunct &quot;Twin Peaks.&quot; Asks the announcer, &quot;What were youwatching the night the rest of us found out who killed LauraPalmer?&quot;   Since each ad plugs a specific show, Chiat took theunusual step of creating several versions of each to air onthe three major networks and Fox. When the talk-show spoofruns on CBS, for example, the listing that follows is for&quot;Northern Exposure.&quot; And when the Ironing Show satire airs onFox, a plug follows for &quot;The Simpsons&quot; (&quot;What were youwatching when Michael Jackson taught Homer Simpson how toMoonwalk?&quot;).   The campaign's approach capitalizes blatantly on viewerinsecurity in an age of explosively multiplying TV channels.It's what Joseph W. Cece, TV Guide's president and publisher,calls &quot;the water-cooler phenomenon&quot; -- everybody at theoffice is talking about a show you didn't see, and &quot;there'sthis feeling I missed out on something I should have beenwatching.&quot;   But in concentrating just on TV listings, TV Guide istaking a substantial risk. The magazine has spent yearsbuilding up, and publicly touting, its in-depth features andinvestigative reporting. It hired a new high-profile editor,Anthea Disney, just weeks ago to beef up coverage even more.She vowed to make the magazine's features even &quot;morecontroversial and a better read.&quot;   Yet the new ads don't so much as mention TV Guide'sreporting, completely ignoring the one thing that really doesset apart the magazine from dry TV listings in newspapers.   The omission is intentional, Mr. Cece and Robert Grossman,a Chiat senior vice president, said in an interviewyesterday. Exhaustive research, Mr. Grossman said, made onething very clear: &quot;The primary reason people buy TV Guide isto find out what's on TV.&quot; The features may be a plus, butthe listings are what make people buy the magazine.   The new ads, created by Chiat's Venice, Calif., office,cap a winning streak for the agency, which has grown from afunky boutique to a powerhouse in recent years. Chiat won theTV Guide business just a few months ago, after a shootoutwith Omnicom Group's BBDO. The ads make their debut barely aweek after Chiat won the most sought-after piece of businessof the year, the $60 million-plus American Express creditcard account.   The agency has earned accolades for some highly creativeadvertising. It created the pink Energizer bunny and craftedNissan's fantasy campaign, including one spot in which theroad belongs, literally, to &quot;Bob.&quot;   But simply being creative won't be enough for the new TVGuide campaign. Last year, Wieden andamp; Kennedy took a shot at aTV Guide campaign. The ads, including one futuristic spot inwhich a man has a satellite implanted in his fliptop head,were widely praised in the industry.   &quot;The Emmys could use something this good,&quot; wrote Adweekreviewer Barbara Lippert. &quot;Each spot is beautifullyart-directed and terribly clever.&quot;   But the ads didn't sell magazines, and Wieden was dumpedfrom the consumer effort. The campaign &quot;was disjointed&quot; and&quot;didn't have an underlying message,&quot; Mr. Cece says now. TheChiat work is an attempt to forge &quot;a more coherent strategy.&quot;   ---   Tobacco Ads in Europe                                                                                                          Tobacco ads, already banned from television in theEuropean Community, may soon be barred from newspapers,magazines, billboards and sporting events, too, under tougherregulations proposed by the EC's executive commission inBrussels.   In addition, health ministers from the 12 European nationsbanned outright the sale of a new product, &quot;oral-moisttobacco,&quot; in which chewing tobacco packaged in a porous pouchis held in the mouth. The ban is effective July 1, 1992.   They also decided to put two warnings on tobacco products,one to warn of risks to smokers and one for the dangers ofsecond-hand smoke.   ---   Ad Notes. . . .
