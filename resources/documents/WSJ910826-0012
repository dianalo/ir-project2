Talks broke down Friday between the Canadian Union ofPostal Workers, which represents 46,000 employees, and CanadaPost Corp., the government agency that operates the postalservice. Workers in Montreal, Toronto, Ottawa and elsewhereleft mail-sorting stations shortly after midnight Friday inthe first round of rotating strikes, which occur in one ormore cities on a given day.</LP><TEXT>   The union hasn't ruled out the possibility of a nationwidestrike.   Canada Post has assured its business customers that itwill continue to move the mail despite the strike, the firstin Canada since 1987. But even temporary delays in deliveringbusiness checks will disrupt cash flow and deal a blow tosmall and medium-sized companies that have already been hurtby the recent economic recession, said Jim Bennett, vicepresident of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business,an industry group. &quot;We anticipate that there will be businessfailures if the strike continues for any length of time,&quot; hesaid.   Direct-marketing firms, which account for 44% of CanadaPost's volume, are expected to be the hardest hit. &quot;Businessdries up during a strike,&quot; said John Gustavson, president ofthe Canadian Direct Marketing Association.   The timing of the postal strike couldn't be worse forCanadian magazine publishers, who have seen advertising andsubscription revenues drop this year. &quot;Even though customersmay want to renew a subscription, everyone is hesitant to puta check in the mail during a strike,&quot; said Catherine Keachie,executive director of the Canadian Magazine PublishersAssociation.   A postal strike will be less disruptive for largerbusiness organizations, which have increased their use ofcourier services and facsimile machines in recent years.Automated banking machines and the electronic transfer offunds at banks also should offset the impact of a strike,said a spokesman for Toronto-based Canadian Imperial Bank ofCommerce.   Bell Canada, the country's largest telephone company, willcontinue to use Canada Post to distribute its bills but hasadvised its seven million customers to pay them at BellCanada offices or banks, the company said. Bell Canada is adivision of Montreal-based BCE Inc.   Meanwhile, courier companies are preparing for a surge inbusiness. Curt Brown, business development manager for UnitedParcel Service Canada Ltd., said the firm has received manyinquiries in recent days from mail users who want to makealternate arrangements.   Violence broke out at several picket lines over theweekend as replacement workers tried to enter Canada Postbuildings. Canadian Labor Minister Marcel Danis said hewouldn't intervene in the dispute. The major issuesoutstanding include wages and the use of part-time workers tofill positions.</TEXT></DOC>
