The cornerstone of the legislation, signed into law last month, is a provision forcing thrifts to increase their capital. The reasoning was that by placing more private capital at risk, thrifts would be less likely to engage in imprudent practices that have depleted the thrift-insurance fund and will cost $166 billion over 10 years to remedy.    But in the rush to complete the emergency bill that delves into arcane areas of finance, the House and Senate versions employed a variety of banking terms open to differing interpretations, especially in areas related to capital standards. The final law scrambles the terms in a way that has regulators at a loss to write consistent regulations. Depending on the interpretation, the final regulations could result in 500 additional thrifts failing to meet the new standards.    &quot;Everyone is coming up with different interpretations,&quot; said Darrell Dochow, an official of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which will become an arm of the Treasury in a matter of weeks. &quot;We're getting input from gobs of sources.&quot;    All banks and thrifts will soon be subject to regulations that link the capital a thrift must maintain to the amount of risk in its lending. Generally, the required capital will average 8% of assets. But aside from that, all thrifts, even those with the least risky loans, will have to meet a standard that the House called &quot;core capital&quot; and the Senate called the &quot;leverage ratio.&quot;    Most industry officials believe Congress intended a 3% minimum. But some industry attorneys are interpreting the specific language to mean 5% or 6%, according to Mr. Dochow, based on the banking industry's use of the term &quot;leverage ratio,&quot; which the industry is still struggling to define.    In the real world, the difference between the interpretations is huge. Nearly 900 Sandamp;Ls, with $500 billion in assets, would fail the 3% capital test; nearly 1,400 institutions, with nearly $1 trillion in assets, would fail a 6% test.    Thrift regulators are tentative because the law says regulations for thrifts may be no less stringent than those for banks. But banking regulators won't finish their capital rules until the end of 1990; thrift regulators must complete their rules by Nov. 7.    Such confusion also has thrift executives and their advisers at a loss. The law allows banks to acquire healthy thrifts for the first time, but buyers are leery of jumping in before the specifics are understood. Moreover, many thrifts are considering the sale of branches, stock offerings or mergers to raise capital but are uncertain how much they need to raise.    &quot;We only know one thing for sure right now,&quot; said Herman Sandler of Sandler O'Neill andamp; Partners, a thrift investment-banking firm. &quot;The guy with 6% tangible capital is in good shape.&quot;    Even beyond capital questions, thrift officials are wrestling with ambiguities in the law that will affect billions of dollars in potential transactions and industry restructuring. For example, once the capital standards are clarified, it's not clear what happens to thrifts that flunk the test.    Growth would be restricted for such thrifts, but how much time will they be given to meet the standards? What would the thrift's regulatory rating be if it complies with its business plan but is out of compliance with capital standards? The answers will affect a thrift's stock price and ability to raise cash.    &quot;As Congress got near the end of the process, they just threw up their hands,&quot; said Danny Wall, director of the Bank Board. </TEXT></DOC>
