Giliberti, a former vice president of Teamsters Local 814 in NewYork, has since shortly after the attempt on his life in 1982cooperated with authorities, including testimony at a federal trialin New York that resulted in the convictions of 12 reputed membersand associates of the Bonanno crime family.   Local 814 is one of four union locals the government has placedunder court trusteeship through the use of federal racketeeringlaws, the subject of the review of the Senate PermanentSubcommittee on Investigations.   Those trustees and a fifth appointed to oversee amultimillion-dollar New York fish market that allegedly wascontrolled by the Genovese crime family told the subcommittee theprocedure has proven successful in rooting out corruption althoughall said those efforts were far from completed.   Giliberti said he helped arrange mob backing of a candidate forpresident of Local 814 and later won Mafia approval to force outthat man, Sal Aiello, and replace him as president with VinnieBracco.   Giliberti said among his many jobs with the union was ``shakingdown'' businesses, generally through promising them favors from thelocal in return for 5 percent of the company's profits. Among thefavors was allowing companies to hire non-union workers or to hireunion workers ``off the books'' so the employer could avoidpayments to union pension and welfare funds, he said.   Giliberti was shot outside his home in July 1982 and, afterrecovering, began cooperating with investigators. He sat behind ascreen while testifying to the subcommittee, visible only tomembers and staff.   Arthur Eisenberg, appointed trustee of Local 814 in 1987following the convictions of several of the union's board membersfor labor racketeering, said the financial condition of the local'spension, welfare and benefit funds has improved dramatically sincehe took control of the union's activities.   ``I believe RICO trusteeships can help carry out the publicpolicy commitment to rid labor organizations of criminalinfiltration and control,'' Eisenberg said.   Concurring in that opinion was Edwin H. Stier, trustee ofTeamsters Local 560 in Union City, N.J., which was placed undertrusteeship in 1986 after a trial featuring lengthy testimonydetailing the control of the Provenzano crime family over the local.   The subcommittee earlier this week heard from TeamsrersPresident William J. McCarthy, who said he had never had dealingswith organized crime. The hearings are to conclude next week withtestimony from AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland and JusticeDepartment officials concerning the appropriateness of courtintervention in union affairs.</TEXT></DOC>
