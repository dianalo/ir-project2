In other words, those who cannot prove they are fleeing politicalpersecution will be returned to Vietnam.   A Foreign Ministry statement said the new policy would takeeffect Tuesday ``and will be applied region-wide.''   ASEAN diplomats said the new policy applies only to Vietnameserefugees.   Since Vietnam ``boat people'' began fleeing their country adecade ago, all the ASEAN countries _ Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand,Brunei, Singapore and the Philippines _ have accepted any Vietnamesewho arrived as a refugee.   Refugees were given temporary asylum and put into camps to awaitresettlement by the United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealandand other Western nations.   ASEAN diplomats said that under the new policy, those arrivingwould be screened by officials of the country where they land, withthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees providingassistance.   Those found to be fleeing for political reasons or fleeingpersecution would be given refugee status. But if it is determinedthe emigrant has left Vietnam hoping for a better economic life inthe West, he or she would be put into a camp to await repatriation.   The ASEAN diplomats said their nations had wanted the cut-offdate to be included in the draft plan developed in Malaysia at theend of a meeting held last week to prepare for an internationalconference on refugees. But representatives from the United Nations,the United States, Sweden and other countries had objected, sayingall those who flee should be given refugee status.   A compromise was reached under which ASEAN could issue a separatestatement on the cut-off date. ASEAN members said Vietnam hasalready agreed, at the planning session, to accept those seeking togo back voluntarily.   But Vietnam has said it would not accept anyone forcefullyreturned. It was still uncertain what would happen to refugeesdenied resettlement who refuse to go back, ASEAN said.   The move follow's Hong Kong's adoption of a similar tough newpolicy under which Vietnamese boat people are considered illegalimmigrants subject to repatriation unless they can prove they fledpersecution. Vietnamese refugees have since the communist takeoverin their country sailed by the tens of thousands to seek asylum innon-communist Southeast Asia.</TEXT></DOC>
