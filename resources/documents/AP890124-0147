Israeli soldiers shot and killed a Palestinian teen-ager in apredawn raid on a West Bank village, and at least 18 Palestinianswere shot in clashes with troops.   Several Israeli newspapers reported that a secret army reportsaid the 13-month rebellion in the Israeli-occupied West Bank andGaza Strip would go on all year and that the violence couldintensify.   The assessment, reportedly compiled by senior officers, said therevolt could not be halted by military means because troops alreadywere doing all they could without resorting to unacceptable levelsof violence.   Israel radio reported that Rabin was considering a policy toblock suspected rioters from entering Israel but said he had notdecided whether to adopt it.   Work in Israel is the main source of income for an estimated100,000 people in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.   Rabin's policies for ending the uprising came under renewedcriticism Tuesday in a letter two dailies printed from anunidentified reserve soldier who said service in the occupied landswas a ``nightmare.''   ``I'm helpless against my feelings and wonder if that's what Iwas raised for by my parents, survivors of the terrible Holocaust,''said the letter.   Last week, soldiers complained to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamirthat they were forced to beat Palestinians to keep order.   The United Nations Relief and Works Agency, which overseesPalestinian refugees, issued a statement expressing concern over the``continuing toll of casualties'' and the indefinite closure of all1,200 West Bank schools.   Israel radio quoted Rabin as saying the school closures, orderedFriday, were helping reduce casualties because classrooms served ashotbeds for protests.   At least 18 Palestinians were reported shot in clashes thaterupted during a general strike called by the PLO-backed leadershipof the uprising to protest the military's policies in the occupiedterritories.   In the Gaza Strip, Arab hospital officials said 16 people werewounded in clashes despite an army curfew ordering 200,000Palestinians to stay home. The wounded included a 12-year-old boysaid to be in serious condition with a bullet wound to the head.   In the West Bank, a teen-ager was reported shot in the head in aclash with soldier at refugee camp No. 1 near Nablus.   Soldiers raiding the West Bank village of Habla were met by asquad of masked Arabs and killed one of them in pursuit, militaryofficials said. Another Palestinian was wounded, and four managed toescape, the officials said.   The army confirmed the Habla incident and said one Palestinianwas wounded in the West Bank. Officials said they were checking theother reports.   The family identified the dead youth as Issam Hashem El-Marabi,19, and said he had been shot several times in the head and chest.   The death raised to 368 the number of Palestinians killed sincethe rebellion against Israel's 21-year occupation began in December1987. Fifteen Israelis also have died.   In the West Bank settlement of Ginot Shomron, a firebomb wasthrown at an Israeli car, but it exploded on the street and causedno damage, Israel radio reported.   Shin Bet security agents, meanwhile, arrested dozens of Arabssuspected of belonging to the so-called Palestinian Popular Army,the military command said.   Israel radio said the group was led by Arafat's mainstream PLOfaction Fatah and supplied weapons for attacks on Israeli soldiersand civilians.   The radio did not mention the type or quantity of weaponsinvolved, and an army spokesman said he was unable to providedetails.   Palestinians have maintained the ``army'' exists mainly on paperand has no guns. Several marches by youths calling themselves suchan army have been held recently in West Bank villages, with somemarchers carrying sticks, axes and knives.</TEXT></DOC>
