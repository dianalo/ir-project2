Many oil economists and analysts also blame the renewed bearish sentiment on high production by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries -- now around 20 million barrels a day -- and the resulting rise in world oil inventories to near-record levels.    Unless OPEC is able to slow its production &quot;creep,&quot; said Lawrence Goldstein, the executive vice president of New York-based Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, &quot;a price collapse should be taken seriously over the next 16 months.&quot;    Yesterday, the North Sea's widely traded Brent crudes fell between 15 cents and 30 cents a barrel to $14 or less on European spot markets. Prices of a popular Mideastern crude, Dubai, were near $12 a barrel or below, depending on the delivery date.    The U.S. futures market was closed yesterday because of the Labor Day holiday. But on Friday West Texas Intermediate, the crude that serves as the futures benchmark, fell below the $15 a barrel considered by many traders to be a technically significant support level. It closed at $14.79 a barrel, down 29 cents -- the lowest since Iran agreed in July to accept the cease-fire with Iraq that became effective Aug. 20.    That is still above field postings for the U.S. crude -- the price that refiners actually pay for the crude they buy in the field. Late last week, most U.S. refiners reduced posted prices 25 cents a barrel to $14.50.    OPEC production, meantime, is continuing to expand after averaging 19.8 million barrels a day or more in August, well above the 18.5 million barrels a day in the second quarter. &quot;Early indications are it could be 20 million or above for September,&quot; Mr. Goldstein said.    According to most estimates, much of the additional oil is coming from four Persian Gulf members of OPEC: Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Iraq. All except Iraq are said to be producing above their OPEC quotas. The pacesetter is the United Arab Emirates, which is now producing nearly double its OPEC quota of 948,000 barrels a day.    Iraq, which is producing as much as 2.8 million barrels a day, doesn't have a quota. It excludes itself from OPEC's production ceiling because it hasn't been given a quota equal to Iran's 2.4 million barrels a day. But a general perception took hold in the oil markets that once a cease-fire was solidly in place, Iraq would reduce its output and return to the OPEC quota system, providing the cartel with the cohesion it needs to balance production with demand.    That perception is changing now. One reason is the continuing climb in OPEC output in the short term -- and the growing recognition that over the long term, Iraq, in peacetime, will be capable of producing prodigious quantities of oil.    Finally, sentiment has been turning bearish from the lack of any immediate positive news from last week's trip to Tehran and Baghdad by OPEC's secretary-general, Subroto. Mr. Subroto went to Iran and Iraq to try to resolve the quota problem and get Iraq back into the fold.    &quot;The increased OPEC output is one byproduct of the Iraq-Iran cease-fire,&quot; reports Petroleum Intelligence Weekly. &quot;By opening new options for OPEC, the easing of tensions in the Gulf is prompting many members to stake their claims to a larger share of output by boosting volumes.&quot;    There are buyers for the extra oil, of course. OPEC isn't pumping it out on the ground. Despite bulging inventories, refiners are continuing to purchase the OPEC crudes as prices drop. But a lot of the oil is going into storage, including tanks and tankers leased by some OPEC members.    As a result, the huge &quot;overhang&quot; of petroleum inventories is worsening. One major U.S. oil company estimates that the world now has an 18-day to 20-day supply of &quot;usable commercial inventories&quot; -- those not necessary for logistical purposes, such as in pipelines or in strategic government storage.    That is 300 million to 400 million barrels too high, or six to eight days above normal levels -- &quot;a scary number,&quot; says the oil company official. </TEXT></DOC>
