However, Judge Peter K. Leisure also granted Bear Stearns's request that its own $20 million claim against the investor be decided by arbitration before the National Association of Securities Dealers.    While the decision means that the complex dispute will be heard in two forums, the matter is far from settled, since each side has filed motions to dismiss the other's case. The case, filed on Oct. 23, 1987, is the first to result from the market upheaval. Bear Stearns had sought arbitration of the investor's claims. Securities firms typically seek arbitration, while investors and consumer advocates often criticize the process, which they claim is tilted in favor of the securities industry.    The conflict began one year ago, when Stephan Lawrence, a Florida investor, alleged that Bear Stearns panicked during the market crash of Oct. 19-20 and caused him severe financial losses.    Mr. Lawrence charged that he and two limited partnerships, East Wind Associates, Ltd., and Pompano-Windy City Partners Ltd., suffered due to the brokerage's unauthorized trading and liquidation of his accounts.    &quot;As a result of panic, mismanagement and indifference,&quot; the complaint alleges, Bear Stearns began to liquidate positions without first notifying the investors of a margin call or giving them an opportunity to meet margin requirements. Mr. Lawrence, an options, securities and commodities trader, further claims that the firm also bought additional equities without authorization, resulting in still more losses. And he alleges that the firm barred his own traders from the floor of the Chicago Board Options Exchange.    In the suit Mr. Lawrence and the Boca Raton, Fla., partnerships are charging the brokerage with violations of various securities laws as well as the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations statute, known as RICO, which allows for triple damages. Mr. Lawrence is seeking $50 million in compensatory damages for his losses and $50 million in punitive damages.    In yesterday's ruling, Judge Leisure said Mr. Lawrence's RICO charges should go to arbitration, while some of the alleged violations of securities law should be argued in federal court.    In Bear Stearns's action against Mr. Lawrence, which the judge ruled would be arbitrated before the NASD, the firm has filed a claim for about $20 million. This, the company contends, is Mr. Lawrence's negative equity, meaning the difference between the value of his securities and his debt to Bear Stearns at the time of the crash.    Mark Cymrot, a Washington, D.C.-based attorney representing Mr. Lawrence and the partnerships, said he could not comment about the 40-page opinion, which he had not yet seen.    Mr. Cymrot did say, however, that his client is critical of the securities industry association's involvement in the dispute. &quot;He feels the NASD is not a fair forum for him because it involves a major industry event and industry players&quot; would be the arbitrators. &quot;The entire dispute should be argued in neutral territory, which means the district court,&quot; said Mr. Cymrot, a partner at the firm Cole Corette andamp; Abrutyn.    The NASD is also a defendant in Mr. Lawrence's suit, along with the Options Clearing Corp., the American and New York Stock Exchanges, and exchanges in California, Chicago and Philadelphia.    Stephen Ratner, a Rosenman andamp; Colin partner representing Bear Stearns, said he saw the decision as &quot;virtually a victory for Bear Stearns. We see it as a decision that upholds arbitration.&quot;    Arbitration is mandatory under most contractual agreements between brokerages and their customers dealing in options or buying on margin. Mandatory arbitration agreements have proliferated since the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in June 1987 that brokers could require their customers to sign them. The most common agreements require customers who believe their brokers have defrauded them to submit to arbitration instead of filing a lawsuit.    While the securities industry has favored arbitration because it keeps brokers and dealers out of court, consumer advocates say investors sometimes unwittingly sign away their rights to sue.    In a move that may be followed by other states, Massachusetts recently eliminated mandatory arbitration in disputes between brokers and dealers. Representatives of the NASD testified against the Massachusetts regulation last summer. </TEXT></DOC>
