Theconcentration of abortion services in specialized abortionclinics has continued to increase as a result of growth inthe number of such providers and higher caseloads perprovider. Conversely, abortion services in hospitals havebeen declining as a result of lower caseloads anddiscontinuation of abortion services altogether. The numberof physicians providing small numbers of abortions in theiroffices has stabilized, but their average caseload issmaller. . . .   It is . . . important that physician and hospital servicesbe available in sparsely populated areas where it is noteconomical to establish clinics. The loss of hospitalabortion services has left increasing numbers of womenwithout any provider in their local areas. It is surprising,however, that the loss of providers has been limited tohospitals, considering the problems confronting privatephysicians and clinics; anti-abortion harassment and violencehave most often been directed at non-hospital providers. Inaddition, private physicians and clinics may have difficultyin obtaining insurance, paying legal and security expenses,and stretching income based on fees that have not kept upwith inflation.   The net decrease in the number of hospitals that performabortions has had the unfortunate effect of reducing abortionservices in states and counties where they were alreadyscarce. Extreme inequality of access to such services alreadyexists, even without new state restrictions that may resultfrom the decision in Webster v. Reproductive Health Services.Women in many parts of the country have to travel longdistances to obtain abortions, and those who manage toovercome such obstacles are likely to have their abortionslater in pregnancy, when the health risks are greater.</TEXT></DOC>
