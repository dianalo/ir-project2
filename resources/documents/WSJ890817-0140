Mombasa is a fine port. Exotic wildlife and nice beaches attract plenty of rich tourists. Nearly everyone speaks English. There hasn't been a coup -- at least not a successful one -- for 26 years.    So why, then, hasn't Kenya gotten any new foreign investment to speak of -- on top of capital outflows -- in the past decade?    &quot;Minor things,&quot; says Silas M. Ita, managing director of Kenya's Investments Promotion Center. &quot;Minor, minor things.&quot;    Things like price controls, import licensing, foreign-exchange manipulation, miles of red tape and, weaving its way through each of these, corruption. The horror stories are legion: A diplomat tells of a blank import license on sale for $400,000; a businessman moans about waiting 15 months to repatriate dividends; a banker complains that it takes six weeks to get approval just to bring in more capital; a company owner describes padding his board with &quot;door-openers,&quot; or people well-connected to the government, as a key to business success.    These tales may not yet have reached the epic levels that have so badly poisoned the business climate in many other African countries. But they are by no means &quot;minor,&quot; as Mr. Ita insists. In fact, corruption and inefficient bureaucracy are having a profound impact here, torpedoing Kenya's reputation as one African country that works.    &quot;It has gotten so that you have to bribe to get someone to find a file and then bribe to get someone to move the file,&quot; says a veteran Kenyan businessman. It is a reflection of the business climate here that none of the executives interviewed for this story would talk for attribution. Says another old Kenya hand: &quot;If you're sitting in a boardroom in San Francisco looking for a place to invest your next $50 million, Kenya is much less attractive than it was 20 years ago.&quot;    The corruption and inefficiency isn't only scaring off new investors; it is chasing away some of those who eagerly flocked here after the country gained its independence from Britain in 1963. According to World Bank figures for Africa, Kenya follows only Liberia, Nigeria and South Africa in cumulative capital flight in recent years. Most of the 100 or so U.S. companies still represented here have sold or withdrawn their subsidiaries and now peddle their products through distributorships owned by local businessmen, who aren't subject to U.S. laws governing the behavior of U.S. corporations abroad.    Kodak (Kenya) Ltd., a unit of Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, N.Y., remains here to service the big tourist business. But businessmen familiar with the company say Kodak experiences many more hassles with red tape and import-licensing delays than does its main competitor, the locally owned distributor for Fuji Photo Film Co., of Japan. &quot;I'm fighting paper to death,&quot; says a Kodak executive.    &quot;You're nuts to run a subsidiary here,&quot; says a Kenyan who distributes U.S. products. &quot;You either take off for Mauritius or Singapore, or you go with a local distributor who can be more flexible in doing what needs to be done.&quot;    The impact of this disinvestment and lack of new investment is magnified by Kenya's annual 4% population growth, which is one of the highest in the world. The government reckons that an additional six million people will be entering the work force by the year 2000, or more than 500,000 a year. But last year, according to government estimates, no more than 100,000 jobs were created. This rising unemployment threatens to undo Kenya's biggest selling point: political stability.    Mr. Ita says the government is seriously trying to boost local and foreign investment. With support from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, the government is pursuing an ambitious import-liberalization plan, which will, in theory, make foreign-currency allocations automatic on 75% of all imported goods. It has decontrolled prices on about 30 items, although many essentials remain under control. And it is targeting Nairobi and Mombasa as &quot;export zones,&quot; where goods can come in and out of the country with a minimum of regulation.    With his finely tailored pinstripes and sparkling gold watch, Mr. Ita projects a promise of prosperity, and his smooth pitch to potential investors is alluring. But just as the tattered wallpaper behind his desk, right below the photo of President Daniel arap Moi, belies this prosperous image, so do corrupt civil servants betray even the best policy intentions.    &quot;The problems of investment aren't susceptible to policy solutions,&quot; says a Western diplomat in Nairobi. &quot;It's a matter of straightening out the administration, of getting people not to accept bribes. This will be a slow, tough process, and a lot of political oxen will get gored in the process, including some very high up.&quot;    But the business community here generally doubts the government's commitment, and ability, to eliminate corruption. Too often, say businessmen, they have heard statements like this one from Mr. Ita: &quot;Corruption should be understood in its own perspective.&quot;    Mr. Ita laughs when asked for an explanation and he ushers the questioner out of his office. But the perspective he mentions is no doubt the perspective of the ruling party, Kenya African National Union, which is intent on tightening its control over all aspects of Kenyan society, including the economy. Party officials assiduously root out any opposition, the president has ordered a crackdown on rumor mongers within the government, and overly critical newspapers are either denied access to certain levels of government or shut down entirely. When it comes to foreign investment, party officials are equally eager to control the action -- and given the number of approvals required for even the most basic business transactions, there is plenty of action to control.    Although there isn't any law requiring Kenyan partnership in foreign investments, officials aren't shy about pointing out the advantages of taking on local investors, or &quot;door openers,&quot; which in most cases turn out to be civil servants and government ministers, or Asian entrepreneurs well connected to various party officials.    &quot;You get a partner who understands the country,&quot; says Mr. Ita, &quot;and it removes the suspicion that your operations are foreign controlled.&quot;    It is also, Mr. Ita pitches, a vital contribution to the country's overall business climate. &quot;Getting the elite of the country to participate in the economic activity of the country is a quite sensible move,&quot; he explains. &quot;If you leave the investments to Americans and British, then the local people will talk of neocolonialism. You don't hear that here, because we participate {in investments}. What you are likely to hear is that the elite are in control of things. But you'll hear that very quietly.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
