My jaw dropped. How could this be? Just a month earlier, in late January, another, much larger, plane had circled the Earth from Seattle to Seattle in just under 37 hours, shattering the previous record by more than eight hours. It was an aviation milestone. No airplane had ever flown around the world so fast, nor was any existing plane likely to do so any time soon. I knew this for a fact. I set the record.    Mind you, I didn't actually fly the aircraft, a Boeing 747SP on loan for the record-setting try from United Airlines. Mostly I sat in a comfy seat, ate terrific food (poached red snapper), watched movies (&quot;Top Gun&quot;) and slept as we whizzed from Seattle, to Athens, to Taipei and back to Seattle. (No, they weren't offering frequent-flier mileage credit.)    But I was aboard, and thus an official co-record holder. So was everyone on the plane: pilots, crew members, journalists and 100 assorted aerospace buffs, including man-on-the-moon Neil Armstrong. Passengers anted up $5,000 apiece for a seat. The money, $500,000 in total, was handed out to children's charities. Mr. Armstrong called it the biggest around-the-world extravaganza since Magellan.    Confirming my status as a flight celebrity, I signed a certificate along with the 140 others aboard to be sent to the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum. Move over Orville and Wilbur.    Now, 30 days later, my niche in aviation's pantheon is gone, sabotaged by Allen Paulson, chairman of Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. Mr. Paulson, a pilot in his own right, said his competitive juices started flowing after Clay Lacy, the chief pilot of our plane, told Mr. Paulson that he was going after the around-the-world record, then held by a Gulfstream III jet.    &quot;You go ahead, and I'll try and whip you; I actually used another word,&quot; the Gulfstream chairman recalls. The two aviators are longtime friends; Mr. Lacy, a United Airlines senior captain and aviation entrepreneur, at one time was the sales manager of a Lear jet distributorship owned by Mr. Paulson.    Mr. Lacy says now that he knew Mr. Paulson was plotting revenge, but figured our record was safe. The long-range version of the Boeing 747 is the only civilian aircraft that can fly around the world with just two refueling stops. (For official record purposes, around the world is defined as no less than 19,864 nautical miles slightly more than the distance at the Tropic of Cancer.)    The 747 is also quick. We averaged 624 miles per hour on our flight, including ground time. For a short while over the North Atlantic, assisted by the jet stream, which blows hardest in midwinter, our ground speed topped 800 mph.    Alas, our flight plan had a few flaws. We lost most of our favorable tail wind by detouring south over Thailand and Vietnam instead of flying over China. Mr. Lacy says he was told China wouldn't allow overflights to planes bound for Taipei, our second refueling stop.    Flight controllers at Athens and Taipei denied our requests for speedy &quot;straight in&quot; landings, inserting us into traffic patterns with scheduled flights. And a refueling truck at Athens failed to pump at the expected pressure, costing us ground time. Beware of Greeks bearing gas.    Mr. Paulson avoided most of these glitches. He took just four other people, three Gulfstream pilots and an official observer from the National Aeronautic Association. His plane, a stripped-down Gulfstream IV fresh off the assembly line, had a reserve fuel tank installed inside the fuselage, increasing fuel capacity by 20%.    The Gulfstream required four fuel stops: Shannon, Ireland; Dubai in the Persian Gulf; Taipei; and Maui, Hawaii. But since it carries only 12% of a 747's maximum fuel load, ground time was blessedly short. Mr. Paulson was in and out of Dubai's airport in under 15 minutes. We spent 62 minutes on the tarmac with the lethargic Athenians.    Mr. Paulson also flew over China. &quot;We told them {China's aviation authorities} what we were doing, and they gave us approval,&quot; he says.    By coincidence, Mr. Paulson's Gulfstream was streaking toward Taipei at the same time Mr. Lacy, at the controls of a scheduled United flight, was heading into Hong Kong. The United plane was battling fierce westerly head winds, meaning the Gulfstream, heading in the opposite direction, was getting a big speed lift.    Mr. Lacy radioed his friend. &quot;This is Clay. How you doing on time?&quot;    &quot;About 45 minutes ahead of schedule,&quot; Mr. Paulson replied. &quot;I just picked the number out of the sky to razz him.&quot;    &quot;Old Al's the luckiest guy I've ever known,&quot; Mr. Lacy says.    As it turned out, the Gulfstream bested our effort by 45 minutes, 41 seconds. Average speed: 638 mph. &quot;I think that'll be hard for somebody to beat,&quot; Mr. Paulson says.    Mr. Lacy, however, muses that an SST, the world's only supersonic commercial airliner, might do the trick. &quot;It'd take six refueling stops. Five if you're lucky. Probably take about 25 hours. . . .&quot;    My flight bag's packed. Lay on the in-flight movies. We aviation giants love a challenge.    ---   Mr. Carlson is the Journal's Regions columnist. </TEXT></DOC>
