MCI Communications Corp. and United Telecommunications Inc., the smallest of the five companies, had the largest percentage gains. MCI's earnings surged 176%, while United Telecom's rose 156%.    Among the regional Bells, earnings increased 28% at Pacific Telesis Group and 18% at U S West Inc. Long-distance carrier GTE Corp. said profit rose 8.2%.    Overall, the results for the five companies were in line with telecommunications analysts' expectations.    GTE Corp.    Stamford, Conn.-based GTE said profit rose because of improved results in all business lines. Revenue rose 6.7% to $3.94 billion from $3.69 billion.    Losses of US Sprint Communications Co., GTE's joint venture with United Telecommunications, narrowed &quot;significantly&quot; from a year earlier but worsened compared with the preceding quarter.    US Sprint's first-quarter loss widened from the previous quarter because of higher marketing costs and other expenses incurred to improve customer service and boost market share.    GTE's first-quarter pretax loss stemming from its 50% stake in US Sprint narrowed to $69.1 million from $120.5 million a year earlier. US Sprint's total revenue rose 23% to $759 million.    Profit from GTE's overall telephone operations advanced slightly from the year-earlier first quarter. Revenue from phone operations rose 5% to $3 billion. GTE also has interests in electrical and communications products.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, GTE shares closed at $35.125, up 12.5 cents.    Pacific Telesis Group   Pacific Telesis Group said its first-quarter earnings surged, bolstered primarily by the strong California economy, streamlined operations and its early retirement program.    San Francisco-based Pacific Telesis said access lines increased 3.7% to 12.6 million and local-long distance volume jumped 9.3% to 684 million.    Revenue rose 7% to $2.3 billion from $2.1 billion a year earlier. Pacific Telesis said revenue was reduced by $14.5 million, reflecting a California Public Utilities Commission decision to adjust rates according to current economic conditions.    Wall Street investors didn't react strongly to the company's results. Pacific Telesis closed at $27.825, up 12.5 cents, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday.    U S West Inc.    Earnings for Denver-based U S West jumped from year-earlier profit, which included a one-time charge of $30.2 million for an employee-reduction program and an Oregon regulatory order to make refunds to customers in that state. Excluding the charge, U S West noted that the latest profit increased a modest 2.6%.    Revenue rose 5.6% to $2.2 billion from $2 billion.    The company said its three telephone companies reported earnings of $244.8 million, compared with the year-earlier $207.3 million. U S West said its non-telephone operations recorded a loss for the quarter but are expected to post profit for the year.    In the latest quarter, U S West bought back about 2.1 million common shares. The company, which now has 185 million common shares outstanding, said it has acquired 6.4 million shares since the stock market plunge in October.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, U S West closed at $51.25, down 12.5 cents.    MCI Communications Corp.    MCI reported that net income more than doubled as calling volume on its long-distance telephone network surged.    The Washington-based long-distance company, which has been concentrating on adding big companies to its customer list, said sales rose 18% to $1.13 billion from $955 million the year before.    Daniel F. Akerson, chief financial officer, attributed the growth spurt to greater use of the company's network, with billable call volume up 14% from the prior quarter and up nearly 40% from the year before. World-wide direct dialing and operator-assistance services introduced in the first quarter also broadened MCI's product spectrum.    In the latest quarter, MCI had positive cash flow, which Mr. Akerson characterized as &quot;marginal but pleasing.&quot; The company has projected it would achieve consistently positive cash flow around the end of the year.    In over-the-counter trading yesterday, MCI rose 50 cents, to close at $12.75.    United Telecommunications   Although hampered by continuing losses at its US Sprint joint venture, United Telecommunication's net more than doubled. The latest results were helped by a non-recurring gain of $10.3 million related to tax benefits.    United Telecom said it absorbed $46.1 million in first-quarter losses from the US Sprint long-distance venture with GTE, compared with $63.1 million in US Sprint losses a year earlier.    In total, US Sprint's pretax operating loss in the quarter was $138 million. US Sprint's progress has been marred for months by massive billing problems. United Telecom officials declined to project when the unit would be profitable.    Revenue for Kansas City, Mo.-based United Telecom totaled $755.4 million, up 7.2% from the year-earlier $704.7 million. Revenue for the company's telephone operations, meanwhile, rose nearly 5% in the quarter to $596.8 million.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, United Telecom shares closed at $28.375, up 50 cents.    ---                          1988              1987                       in      per      in       per     %                    millions  share   millions  share   chg.
