The National Transportation Safety Board, in a ruling Tuesday,asked the railroad industry to ``make an in-depth assessment'' ofwhat it can do to ensure that crews operate trains without fallingasleep at the controls.   The railroad industry has long had unpredictable work schedules,but the problem has worsened, the board said. It blamed theelimination of many regularly scheduled freight and passengertrains, a cutback in yard operations, agreements protecting employeeseniority, longer freight runs and relocations of work assignments.   ``Under present conditions, many train crew members may well worktheir entire careers without ever having a job with regularlyassigned working hours and off-duty periods,'' the board said,adding that this leads to sleep disorders.   The recommendations came in a report on a Jan. 14, 1988, crashthat killed four men _ two engineers and two brakemen operatingConrail trains that plowed into each other outside Thompsontown, Pa.   The board concluded that engineer Melvin Russell Curry, 40, andbrakeman Francis Joseph Madonna, 46, were asleep when warningdevices went off and said Curry likely responded to the warning byhitting a foot pedal in his sleep, deactivating an automatic brakingsystem.   Killed in the crash in addition to Curry and Madonnna, wereengineer Russell Paul Henderson, 30, and brakeman Charles StephenDeSantis, 56, who were operating a 61-car train headed from Chicagoto Harrisburg, Pa.   The two trains were moving at a combined speed of 71 miles perhour when they collided, with one locomotive plowing over the top ofthe other one.   The board recommended several changes in the warning system,safety controls, locomotive design and the line's computer-basedtraffic control system, but it laid the brunt of blame on erraticwork schedules.   ``The probable cause of this accident was the sleep-deprivedcondition of the engineer and other crew members ... which resultedin their inability to stay awake and alert,'' the board said.   The report said none of the men on the coal train, which washeaded from Baltimore, Md., to Altoona, Pa., had had more than twohours' sleep in the previous 22 to 24 hours, and they had not eatenin more than 13 hours. The men had reported for work at 11:30 p.m.and the crash was at 7:45 a.m. the next day.   The report said Curry had a different starting time almost everyday and worked any day of the week. It said he had only about 1{hours of sleep and an hour's nap in the 24 hours prior to the crash.   Conrail spokeswoman Pat Linsky said the company could not commentin detail until officials had reviewed the board report.   But the railroad said Curry and Madonna had signed off theirprevious runs 37.5 hours earlier and the conductor 50 hours beforeboarding the Baltimore-Altoona train.   The company also said that the safety board had a statement fromthe engineer's wife saying he liked his job and had no problems withthe erratic hours.</TEXT></DOC>
