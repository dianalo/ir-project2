Gerhard Schmid, a federal lawmaker in the opposition SocialDemocrats, said the ``entire European Economic Community lies inthe geographical range'' of the falling satellite's path and thatthe area could be peppered with radioactive debris.   Schmid said Soviet officials confirmed the satellite left orbitand was expected to re-enter the atmosphere in September. Westernsources have said it could crash in August or earlier.   Tass, the official Soviet news agency, has reported that radiocontact was lost in April with the Cosmos 1900 satellite, launchedDec. 12, 1987.   In his statement, Schmid called for precautions, without sayingwhat they should be. He announced he had sent a letter about thesatellite to Jacques Delors, president of the European EconomicCommunity Commission.   The Soviets have put 33 nuclear-powered satellites into space.When one of them re-entered the atmosphere in 1978, it rainedthousands of pieces of radioactive debris on Canada.</TEXT></DOC>
