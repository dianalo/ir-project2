Mr. Seymour ignored that Mr. Gotlieb is immune by diplomatic treaties from any demand to show up in a U.S. court. For good measure, Mr. Seymour also subpoenaed the ambassador's wife, Sondra Gotlieb.    There is only one explanation for Mr. Seymour's action. This is not ignorance of the applicable law, which is known to every first-year law student. Instead the explanation was nicely summed up by University of Chicago Law Prof. Gidon Gottlieb in a comment to the New York Times. He said it was &quot;incredible -- it strikes me as obvious that the people who issued the subpoena must have known it was simply a device to embarrass the Canadian government.&quot; So Mr. Seymour, a lawyer in private practice, is empowered by his position as special prosecutor to use the powers of the state to upset U.S.-Canadian relations to score a legal point in court. A State Department lawyer agreed, telling a federal judge that Mr. Seymour's subpoena &quot;calls into question the ability of the United States to carry out its international obligations.&quot;    This is not an isolated boner by Mr. Seymour. It is an inevitable result of the very notion of an &quot;independent prosecutor,&quot; not accountable to elected officials and oblivious to any broader governmental responsibilities. Especially so since the &quot;independent prosecutors&quot; are usually trying to find criminal violations in ill-defined and highly political pieces of legislation such as the Ethics in Government Act or the Boland amendment.    Just as Mr. Seymour has strained relations with one of our closest allies, &quot;independent counsel&quot; Lawrence Walsh enraged another ally by subpoenaing David Kimche, a former Israeli intelligence official who might know something about Iran-Contra and just happened to be in the United States. This caused a three-alarm furor in Jerusalem, Foggy Bottom and on Capitol Hill. There had been a deal to give Congress some access to Israeli officials and documents -- a deal Mr. Walsh threatens to undo.    Prosecutor Walsh had already put everyone on notice that he was a loose cannon. His first &quot;victory&quot; was to get Carl Channell and Richard Miller to plead guilty to a conspiracy to violate the tax code by raising funds to pay for arms. Aside from the silliness of reducing Iran-Contra to tax-code technicalities, it turns out that neither the Internal Revenue Service nor the Justice Department thinks a charity automatically loses its tax exemption if it raises money spent buying arms.    Independent prosecutors obviously think they make their own rules, and apparently have convinced most of the press and public. They ought to read their own charter. In the legislative history of the Ethics in Government Act and its amendments there is explicit concern that giving them unfettered discretion &quot;usurps the legitimate discretion and prosecutive authority of the Attorney General.&quot;    Under the original 1978 act, these counsels were instructed to follow precedents and established Justice Department policies &quot;to the extent the special prosecutor deems appropriate.&quot; Congress worried that this gave them too much discretion. So in 1982, Congress changed the law to further limit special prosecutors. The law now says that they &quot;shall, except when not possible, comply with the written or other established policies of the Department of Justice respecting enforcement of the criminal laws.&quot;    If Mr. Seymour and Mr. Walsh are violating this provision, who polices the prosecutors? The section of the law on &quot;Removal of an Independent Counsel&quot; says they can be removed by impeachment, conviction or by the attorney general &quot;for good cause.&quot; Good cause is a vague term, but we have no doubt it includes failing to abide by the law's explicit instructions to follow Justice Department policies. But Edwin Meese would commit political suicide if he did his duty under the Ethics in Government Act and removed Messrs. Seymour and Walsh.    Under a Constitution based on separation of powers, no attorney general and no president should be put in this position. The fact that no one can control the special prosecutors is strong evidence of their unconstitutionality. The law chartering them expires in January, and presumably Democrats in Congress will delight in extending it. It's time for President Reagan to pledge to veto any more unconstitutional special-prosecutor laws, in discharge of his responsibility to all future presidents. </TEXT></DOC>
