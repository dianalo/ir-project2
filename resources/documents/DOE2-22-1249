Diffusional distribution was taken by trace autoradiography methodusing /sup 10/B(n, a)/sup 7/Li nuclear reaction. Comparison to chemicaldiffusion has shown that for near-the-surface region the isoconcentrationaldiffusion coefficient is higher than the chemical diffusion coefficient.An assumption is made that an increased trap concentration exists ina highly doped near-the-surface region. Such traps are represented byboron atoms in lattice sites forming stiff associates with diffusion-activeboron.</TEXT></DOC>
