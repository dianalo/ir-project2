Marcus, PaineWebber Inc.'s influential steel analyst.    Such a view would have seemed unthinkable just a few months ago. But Mr. Marcus last week forecast a 50% chance of a major shortage in the downtrodden metal lasting into 1989. Steel's previous boom era was in 1973-74.    &quot;I think we've already entered the early stages of a shortage,&quot; contends Mr. Marcus, who last week recommended Inland Steel. &quot;The long-term earnings outlook in steel is extraordinarily favorable.&quot;    The PaineWebber analyst, predicting an era of robust recovery for U.S. steelmakers, thinks Chicago-based Inland will earn $218 million next year, or $6.10 a share, up from $19 million in 1986. Under optimum conditions, he thinks Inland could earn as much as $295 million, or $8.50 a share.    Mr. Marcus also thinks Bethlehem Steel is attractive. He thinks Bethlehem will earn $272 million, or $4.80 a share, in 1988 and potentially as much as $413 million. Bethlehem last year had a $153 million net loss. Both companies' earnings, given their small float and lack of diversification, are highly responsive to steel price changes.    In spite of his stature among steel analysts -- Mr. Marcus closely tracks U.S. and world steel prices -- some investors painfully recall his erroneous prediction of another boom in the mid-1970s. Waiting for that bonanza, steelmakers watched the sky fall.    But this time, steel supplies are constrained -- the legacy of years of capacity-cutting in a buyer's market. Mr. Marcus estimates that mills in the U.S., Europe, South America and non-Communist Asia are operating at 87% of their 516 million metric tons of effective annual capacity.    U.S. mills are straining even harder. Steelmakers, awash in red ink, have slashed capacity to 111 million short tons from 154 million tons in 1981. Moreover, current capacity figures are illusory. Some idle mills probably won't restart because of the high labor costs involved, and mechanical problems have idled others.    Demand, meanwhile, is picking up as users -- some panicked by price increases -- rebuild inventories. Mr. Marcus expects U.S. producers to ship 74 million tons this year, up from his earlier forecast of 67 million tons. Next year he looks for shipments of 78 million tons, the highest since 1981.    A weak dollar has discouraged imports, as has the U.S. government's steel quota program. So U.S. steelmakers have steadily pushed up prices this year to so-called spot or non-contract customers, mainly metals distributors.    A primary premise in Mr. Marcus's roseate forecast, though, is that steelmakers wield enough clout to impose those recent price increases on their more powerful contract customers, who account for half of the market. That battle is already under way, with steelmakers negotiating 1988 pacts with Chrysler, the No. 3 auto maker, and makers of farm equipment, heavy machinery and appliances.    Mr. Marcus expects suppliers to win increases of $30 to $60 a ton in bellwether products such as high-grade cold-rolled steel, which currently sells on the spot, or merchant, market for $460 a ton. &quot;The question right now is how big the increases will be,&quot; he says.    Other analysts, though anticipating a rebound, are more skeptical. General Motors wrested 1% to 3% price cuts in its 1988 model-year contract negotiations last spring, observes Charles Bradford of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. &quot;I can't conceive of the steel companies going to Chrysler and asking for more than GM,&quot; Mr. Bradford says.    Steel stocks already have climbed more than 50% this year, on a belief that operating conditions will improve soon. But bulls may still find fresh cause for optimism in Mr. Marcus's views.    For the nation's six major steelmakers -- USX, LTV, Armco, National Intergroup, Bethlehem and Inland -- Mr. Marcus is forecasting 1988 earnings of $2.17 billion. Under his &quot;shortage&quot; scenario, the six producers would earn $2.86 billion. Both estimates include sizable nonsteel earnings.    Of the major steel analysts, Mr. Marcus is by far the most bullish. Merrill Lynch's Mr. Bradford expects Inland, for instance, to earn $3 a share in 1988, while Michelle Galanter Applebaum of Salomon Brothers forecasts $3.28 a share. Goldman Sachs's Wayne Atwell estimates $2.50 a share.    The most controversial implication of Mr. Marcus's forecast, though, is that -- unlike industry arguments that there is a surfeit of mills in the U.S. and the world -- supply and demand have finally reached equilibrium. &quot;If the world economy heats up,&quot; he contends, &quot;there won't be enough capacity.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
