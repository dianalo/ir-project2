Yesterday, however, several new issues hit the market -- which was little changed -- and their prices rose just as they would have in the good old days.    In fact, 18 new issues have quietly started trading on the National Association of Securities Dealers automated quotation service since last month's market collapse, and their prices currently are up an average of 6.4%. That's better than the typical Nasdaq stock, which has fallen 2% since Oct. 30.    Yesterday the Nasdaq composite index edged up 0.46% to 318.22; while the National Market System industrial index rose 0.58% to 122.29. National Market System volume, at 87.1 million shares, was similar to Tuesday's.    In over-the-counter trading, Paulson Investments of Portland, Ore., completed its offering for International Yogurt. The issue opened in Nasdaq trading yesterday at 4, which was also the offering price, and climbed 9% to 4 3/8.    Like most new issues these days, International Yogurt didn't come to market without effort. When the company originally filed in September, it planned to offer 600,000 shares. But after the crash, the offering was revised to 500,000 shares. What's more, the stock has been quoted on the Nasdaq system since last Thursday, but shares couldn't actually trade until the offering was completed and all shares were issued to investors. Five other potential new issues are in a similar situation on Nasdaq.    Meanwhile, on the Big Board, where few new issues except closed-end investment funds have opened for trading since the crash, Thomson McKinnon, the investment banking firm, sold part of its asset management subsidiary in the form of 3.3 million limited partnership units at 9 1/4. The new issue closed at 9 7/8. According to Eugene Brennan, senior vice president of syndicate operations for Thomson McKinnon, the brokerage firm increased the offering from three million units right before the sale.    Among the biggest of the 18 post-crash new issues on Nasdaq is LVMH Moet-Hennessy Louis Vuitton S.A., an American depositary receipt that is the result of an Oct. 23 merger between Moet and Vuitton. Such ADRs are U.S. shares that trade in U.S. dollars, backed by foreign shares held by a trustee. Holders of Vuitton shares, which had previously traded on Nasdaq as ADRs, got five LVMH shares for every eight Vuitton shares they held. On Sept. 30, just before the U.S. market collapse, Vuitton shares were quoted on Nasdaq at 48 1/4. Thus a share of LVMH -- had LVMH existed at that time -- would have been worth 77 1/4.    When trading opened on the Paris Bourse and on Nasdaq Oct. 23, the U.S. OTC market was still dropping. It hit bottom Oct. 28. The LVMH shares opened at 61 and by Oct. 28 had plunged to 44 3/4. Yesterday the issue closed at 52, up 1/2.    The continuing flow of little new issues into Nasdaq trading and the success of many of those issues contrasts with the strategy of large companies: Large companies have been holding back, preferring not to offer their shares under current rocky market conditions.    Furthermore, small issues that came out on the blackest days of the crash have performed best for investors. Z-Coat Group, for example, which makes a coating for missiles, couldn't or didn't open for trading on Oct. 23, its issue date. When the shares finally traded on Oct. 27, the issue changed hands at 1 1/4. It caught the rebound and has since jumped 40% to 1 3/4. The issue price of Z-Coat units -- which included shares and warrants -- was 6; they closed yesterday at 10 1/2, a 75% rise. </TEXT></DOC>
