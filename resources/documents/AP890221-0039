The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 197.00 points, or 0.61percent, closing at 31,980.08. That was its first closing below the32,000-yen level since Feb. 14, when it ended at 31,982.89.   It had set a record high closing of 32,177.08 on Monday.   The plunge in the index resulted mainly from the dollar's quickrise on the foreign exchange market, said an analyst with NomuraSecurities, Japan's largest brokerage.   He also said prospects for a tighter economic policy in theUnited States, possibly leading to higher interest rates,discouraged investors from buying stock while awaiting Congressionaltestimony by U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspanscheduled later today.   Expectations of higher interest rates generally discourage stockbuying, the analyst added.   In addition, he said, institutional investors feared the Nikkeihad risen too high recently and were selling to take profits.   In active trading, with first section volume estimated at 1.2billion shares, steel and real estate shares were among losers.   In currency dealings, the dollar closed at 127.15 yen, up 1.40yen from Monday's 125.75-yen finish. The dollar opened at 126.60yen, its low for the day, and went as high as 127.35 yen.   The dollar's sharp rise was prompted by expectations of Greenspansuggesting a tighter U.S. economic policy later today, dealers said.   Higher U.S. interest rates tend to make dollar-denominatedinvestments more attractive to foreigners.   Some traders avoided major moves before Greenspan's testimony,dealers added.</TEXT></DOC>
