The amendment, sponsored by Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D.,Texas), a critic of increasing foreign investment andinfluence in this country, would outlaw PACs operated bycompanies that are more than 50% foreign-owned. It wasapproved by a vote of 73-27 during the Senate's second fullday of debate on legislation to overhaul the financing offederal elections.</LP><TEXT>   Senate Democrats and Republicans have both embraced atotal ban on PACs, but are worried that such a stringent stepmight not withstand constitutional challenge. The Bentsenamendment would apply only if such an outright ban were ruledunconstitutional.   Federal law prohibits foreign nationals and corporationsfrom directly contributing money to U.S. politicalcandidates. Since 1978, through a series of advisoryopinions, the Federal Election Commission has said that aslong as a company is incorporated in the U.S, it isn't aforeign entity and may sponsor a PAC if it follows certainrules.   In June, however, the commission reversed course and votedto open a rule-making proceeding to prohibit PAC sponsorshipby U.S. corporations owned or controlled by foreigninterests. That could lead to regulations that would bealmost identical to the amendment passed by the Senate. Asimilar amendment will probably be introduced when the Housetakes up campaign-finance legislation later this week.   Sen. Bentsen said his amendment would &quot;limit what has beena rapidly growing source of foreign influence on domesticAmerican politics.&quot; He cited a recent study done for hisoffice by the Congressional Research Service that showed PACsof companies with significant foreign ownership gave $2.8million to federal candidates in the 1987-88 election cycle,representing 5% of the total given by all corporate PACs.   Opponents of the amendment said it discriminated againstU.S. citizens who happen to work for companies that areacquired by foreign conglomerates. &quot;The effect will be tocreate two classes of Americans,&quot; warned Sen. Mitch McConnell(R. Ky).</TEXT></DOC>
