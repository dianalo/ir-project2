But ... once the record is in the shops, there's noway to get it back.''   ``Raices,'' Spanish for roots, is his latest album, out thismonth. He and model Brooke Shields recently finished filming a45-minute music video in Miami based on one of the album's songs.The album will be released in Spanish, French, Italian andPortuguese, but it will be an American sound, Iglesias said.   ``It's very lively in a way, but in another way it's completelydifferent in the way we use instruments,'' he said. ``I love verymuch this album _ I hope.''   Even after Iglesias has sold 115 million records _ a numbercomparable to Michael Jackson and Bruce Springsteen _ he wonderswhether he can keep up the pace in record sales. But he has doubtsabout his success _ both in America and overseas.   ``Success in life is illogical. There is not a logical answer.If you have an explanation why you have success, you just have toput in a computer this and this and this, and you are going to havesuccess in America. And it's not true,'' Iglesias said. ``So don'task me why I have success in America, because if I knew why I woulddoubt it.''   After a promising career as a professional soccer goalie inSpain, Iglesias was in a car accident that paralyzed him from thewaist down. He underwent four years of intensive rehabilitation,including exercising his injured fingers with a guitar his familygave him.   He vowed to his mother that he would sing at a Spanish songfestival, and Iglesias kept his vow in 1968. His singing career waslaunched.   Another challenge was learning English _ at 38 years old.   ``In all the Latino roots of languages, like Italian andSpanish, I found my music much more natural,'' Iglesias said.``What's happened in English, for example, is that the phrasing iscompletely different.''   Iglesias has recorded only 30 songs in English, but some havebeen hits, such as duets with such artists as Stevie Wonder, WillieNelson and Diana Ross. The native of Madrid has recorded 150 songsin Spanish, 74 in French, 60 in Italian, 45 in Portuguese and 30 inGerman.   His black hair slicked straight back and wearing all white,Iglesias said a third all-English album may be recorded sometimethis summer.   ``It takes two years for me to do an English album correctly,''he said. ``It takes too much stress out of my life to do an Englishalbum. And I love to sing in English.''   Iglesias, who is divorced and a father of two sons and adaughter, lives in Indian Creek Village on a private island nearMiami Beach. He is part owner of the Miami Heat, the rookie probasketball team.   He did one worldwide tour last year, and is planning another.   As for his success with the tour _ that will be determined bythe outbreak of goose bumps.   ``I always said in a concert of two hours, if you are able forfive minutes to put people in goose bumps, some people will neverforget you.''   Some haven't.   Iglesias has it all now. His personal life is balanced, and hehas all the money he needs. His only doubts are surviving as anartist whose ballads can move an audience.   ``There's a moment in your life when you don't need the money.It's not a question of making you ... richer than you already are.That's over in my life,'' Iglesias said. ``I don't need anythingelse than success, than lights, than surviving as an artist.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PM Mon May 15</NOTE></DOC>
