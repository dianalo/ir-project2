 Software PostScript interpreters haverecently become popular as a low-cost method of adding to the graphics andfont-handling capabilities of a wide range of printers.andP;  Packages such asFreedom of the Press and GoScript can accept PostScript code and then drive arange of dot-matrix or laser printers, but both are relatively slow.andM;In trying to print more dots per inch, it was soon discovered that the Canonlaser engine, that can be found in Canon, Ricoh, Brother and Hewlett-Packardmachines, is capable of running at resolutions in excess of the 300x300dpithat's the standard for personal laser printers.andP;  Both of the packagesreviewed use a combination of expansion card for the PC, expansion card forthe printer and driving software to enhance the printed resolution and fontsupport of the test printer -- an HP LaserJet II.andM;LaserMasterandM;LaserMaster's LX6 sets out to provide three enhancements to your currentLaserJet II: faster printing, increased print resolution and increasedfunctionality.andP;  It does this without recourse to the standard PostScript pagedescription language (PDL): it uses its own PDL to drive the laser printer'sengine at either 600x300 or 400x400dpi or, using special software,800x800dpi.andM;Installation of the LaserMaster isn't particularly complex, but it isn'tmentioned in the manual.andP;  Instead, the manual assumes you've installed theentire package and are ready to use it.andP;  In point of fact, the installprocedure (type 'install' and press Enter) was written on the label of thefirst of the 15 disks supplied.andP;  Installation of the main software followed.andO;The setup program is then run, from which the outline printer and screendisplay fonts are installed.andM;Once all the files are loaded (the main driver program takes 1.1Mb of diskspace and the 35 font types supplied each require 50Kb disk capacity) theLaserMaster board type is identified and the applications to be driven areselected.andP;  Since the LaserMaster uses a nonstandard PDL, special drivers arerequired to use its capabilities from any application.andP;  Four are currentlysupported GEM including Ventura Publisher, Windows, WordPerfect and MicrosoftWord.andP;  This should cover a fair proportion of the intended users, but isn'textensive.andP;  With the software installed you have to plug the full-length cardinto an 8-bit slot and the personality module into the back of the LaserJet,and connect them with the short (3 metre), thin, telephone-style cable.andM;Unlike the RIPS card, there's only a small quantity of code to download tothe controller (from a line in your AUTOEXEC file) and it takes just a coupleof seconds.andP;  The PC card's onboard 6Mb RAM and CPU (which couldn't beidentified since its, markings had been removed) then handle all fontassignments and manipulations.andM;And it's these font manipulations that are one of the interesting features ofthe LaserMaster.andP;  In the case of Ventura Publisher and Pagemaker, colours canbe assigned a font operator.andP;  This means that using the LaserMaster controlpanel (more of which later) you can assign the text rotation, outlining andfill pattern to any colour.andP;  Then, if you want a section of text filled androtated, just change its colour.andP;  LaserMaster does the rest.andP;  It soundsrather clumsy but in practice it works very well.andM;To print from, say, Ventura, load the new LM widith table and selectLaserMaster as the output device (both of which are added to Ventura when youinstall the Ventura drivers).andP;  Then, when you print a document, a new windowappears from which the resolution of output (either 300 or 600dpi) and thefont operator to colour assignments can be made.andP;  Again, the drivers havebeen well integrated into the packages supported, and work effectively.andM;The printing times were good: on the Ventura test pages they proved to be onesecond faster than the RIPS card and twice the speed of the originalLaserJet.andP;  Although initially I thought the lack of PostScript support woldbe a disadvantage, in use it proved not to be.andP;  35 Bitstream font types aresupplied and any Bitream fonts (and there are over 200) can be added.andM;All this is rather clumsily covered in the manual, along with instructionsfor the range of utilities which includes a PostScript file interpreter.andO;This provides a degree of compatibility for anyone requiring PostScriptoutput -- direct the output to a file, then direct the file to theinterpreter.andP;  In addition, utilities are available to print AutoCAD files,and provide network support and monitor imaging systems giving true WYSTWYG.andM;Interestingly, LaserMaster also supports duplexing.andP;  This is a featureavailable in a few laser printers (such as the LaserJet IID or the CanonLBP8-IIR) that print on both sides of the paper.andP;  LaserMaster LX6 can copewith this automatically if fined in these two printers.andM;One noticeable difference between this and the RIPS card was the printedoutput.andP;  The RIPS output was clean and provided very smooth, well-formedcharacters.andP;  The LaserMaster appeared to use a slightly lighter version ofthe faces -- they looked thinner -- and in some cases the sides appeared tobe very jagged.andP;  I suspect that this, however, was down to the toner quality.andO;Lasermaster, though, is now shipping its controllers with TurboRes --software which effectively pushes up the resolution to the equivalent of800x800dpi.andM;The total package costs just under a third more than the RIPS card, but nwithTurboRes) offers a higher maximum resolution.andP;  It offers full Bitstream fontcapability, but a worse manual and PostScript file rather than applicationsupport.andP;  On the plus side Lasermaster is already able to supply controllersfor the Laserjet III and MCA versions.andM;RIPS 4004iandM;Launched late last year at Comdex Fall in Las Vegas, RIPS high-resolutioncontroller adds both enhanced resolution and PostScript compatibility to arange of printers (see Printers supported box).andM;Installation is a three-stage process and starts with the software.andP;  Theentire software arrived on a single, high-density 5-1/4-inch floppy disk.andO;This was so different from LaserMaster's 15 disks that I was sure somethinghad been missed out, but no.andP;  The installation program is straightforward andcopies the dozen files to your hard disk, then checks your current PC'shardware configuration to ascertain the number of printer ports alreadyinstalled, and finally adds a line to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.andM;The hardware can either be configured as LPT1 or LPT2 -- you're advised whichto use according to the findings of the installation program.andP;  Setting theRIPS card to occupy whichever port is free is simply a matter of moving ajumper.andP;  Having done that, plug the full-length card into any 8-bit PC slot,plug the personality module into the back of the LaserJet II, connect the20-foot cable between the two, and that completes installation.andM;Both the PC and LaserJet expansion cards are heavily populated -- the main PCcontroller has 4Mb of RAM and an Intel-designed RISC processor (running at25MHz) which handles all the work.andP;  The software half only comes into effectwhenever the PC is rebooted.andM;The RIPS 40041 carries 35 typefaces (licensed from Bitstream) to which anyPostScript operator can be applied.andP;  The main difference that's immediatelynoticeable between the RIPS setup and a normal PostScript printer is theincreased resolution of the output.andP;  This is, in fact, boosted from the300x300dpi of the original LaserJet to 600x300dpi.andM;As a result of this doubling of dots per unit area, the print quality isexcellent -- it's very difficult to see any jagged edges on characters, tosuch an extent that the quality of the toner and paper being used plays asignificantly greater part in the process than before.andP;  Although notmentioned in the manual, using as fine a paper as possible and a littleexperimentation with the toner contrast dial will make a difference to theoutput's clarity.andM;A second area in which the RIPS interface makes a good impression is in thespeed at which pages are delivered.andP;  Processing a PostScript file was veryrapid, due to the high-speed dedicated Intel processor and the high-speedvideo link used between card and printer rather than a more usual parallel orserial port.andP;  Printing test pages from Ventura Publisher 2 proved it to bejust a whisker slower than the LaserMaster (in 600dpi mode), and twice thespeed of the 'untreated LaserJet.andP;  I tried driving the card from a number ofdifferent word processors and graphics programs -- all set to PostScriptoutput -- and all worked correctly.andP;  The card did occasionally have a hiccupand stop working when I warm-booted my AT, but switching on and off at themains solved that problem.andM;In all, the package, with its very slim but adequate manual, providedexcellent output, rendering grey shades usable at 600dpi rather than thenoticeably 'spotty' look that characterizes grey shades at 300 dpi.andP;  A finalnice touch was the inclusion of a monitor program which allows PostCriptcommands to be entered directly.andM;The package was rapid to install and fast in use.andP;  Perhaps the only slightsticking point is the price.andP;  If you already own a LaserJet and need quantityPostScript output, this would be one option.andP;  Unfortunately for RIPS, it'snow possible to pick up a complete PostScript printer for a similar price tothis package.andP;  Of course, the resolution is twice as good and would be, inmany cases, adequate as a direct to camera source.andP;  If it isn't addinganother 2Mb of RAM will boost the resolution to 800x400dpi.andP;  In the nextcouple of months RIPS will be producing a card compatible with the newLaserjet III and an MCA version of the existing card.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
