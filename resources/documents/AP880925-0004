(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Labor leaders for Bay Area Rapid Transittrain operators threatened to halt service Sunday unless the agencystops teaching supervisors how to drive trains as preparation for astrike by another union.   ``Since there isn't a strike, our union's position is BARTcannot train people to do our work when we're still there on theproperty,'' said Hank White, president of the Amalgamated TransitUnion.   Although it isn't striking, the transit union, which represents500 station agents and train operators, has promised to honorpicket lines by United Public Employees Union.   The transit agency started classes Saturday because of athreatened strike at 12:01 a.m. Monday by 1,200 janitors,maintenance workers and clerks represented by Local 790.   At first, White threatened to order train operators to get offtheir trains at the end of their routes starting at 2 p.m. Saturdayunless the classes were canceled.   BART spokesman Mike Healy said the training was ``temporarily''discontinued. White said he expected the classes to resume Sunday.   ``If that happens we will instruct our train operators tocomplete their runs, but go no farther than the end of the line andthen to stand by the trains and await further instructions,'' Whitesaid Saturday night.   ``We're not going to stand by and let management learn to driveour trains when we're not even on strike,'' White said.   Meantime, some 100,000 commuters face the threat of gridlockthis week as both sides in a contract dispute predict a strikeagainst the 71{-mile train system.   A state mediator Saturday succeeded in getting representativesfrom BART and the United Public Employees Union to resumenegotiations, but initial efforts at averting the strike failed.The two groups, plus the mediator, planned to meet late into thenight.   ``There are a bunch of people scurrying around trying to see ifthey can get this thing settled,'' said BART board member HowardAbelson. ``But it's not looking too good.''   ``It'll be holy hell,'' said 29-year-old Tracy Hughes, a bankteller who relies on BART to get her to San Francisco from herOakland home.   Officials say if everyone abandoned by the train system went fora car, it would increase the number of rush-hour vehicles that nowcompete for position on the 8.4-mile San Francisco-Oakland BayBridge by 50 percent.   The disputed contract proposals involve profits from retirementfund investments, union activity during work hours, sick leaverestrictions and overtime.   To meet the strike threat, BART announced managers would run areduced schedule of trains on Monday.   The two unions have been working without a contract since June.</TEXT></DOC>
