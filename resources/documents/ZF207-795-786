 With DEC as king of the minis, it isn't surprising to find aplethora of tools waiting at the starting gate.andM;The VAX is often thought of as a departmental computer that runs less thanstate-of-the-art systems usually offloaded from the mainframe as acost-reduction measure.andP;  While this image is certainly a true one in someorganizations, others have discovered the power of clustering two or more DECVAXs to achieve increased capacity as well as a distributed architecture.andO;Clustering VAXs often leads to capacities equal to or greater than Big Blueitself; networking diverse VAXs can lead to distributed AI.andM;Most expert systems come in two flavors--standalone PC workstation ormainframe (embedded or not) versions.andP;  These systems are characterized ascentralized, meaning a single-component system.andP;  Frequently these large,centralized systems become verbose and unwieldy, which happened to DEC whiledeveloping its now famous XCON expert system.andP;  XCON assists in configuringDEC's unique computers.andP;  With more than 8,000 possible parts, the humantechnical writer often made mistakes, but XCON sizes out at more than 10,000rules.andP;  Built in the halcyon early days of expert-system computing when rulebases were thought of as dumpsites for rules in any order, the rule base wasunstructured and nearly impossible to maintain.andP;  XCON-IN-RIME is the new andimproved version of XCON.andP;  It's structured and organized around the logicalfunctions of minicomputer assembly.andM;All programmers should be familiar with structured methodology.andP;  Programs aremodularized with only related processes coded into any one program and linkedto provide a network of software.andP;  This methodology is cost-effective, easilymaintainable, and currently the norm.andP;  It follows that AI systems could bejust as easily modularized; in fact, some forward-thinking AIers are doingjust that.andP;  The next step is modularization across distributed systems, andDEC again is king of the network.andM;A full cadre of AI tools runs on DEC: from the ever-popular traditional C tothe less-than-popular but quite necessary symbolic language VAX LISP, fromthe ART hybrid environment to the old standard OPS5, from Software Aandamp;E's KESto the new standard shells.andP;  The secret to AI's power for the IS masses isthe shell, and DEC's menu has two full-bodied selections to serve up--NeuronData's Nexpert and Artificial Intelligence Technologies' Mercury.andP;  And fordessert we can offer Level5 and KES.andM;MERCURY ON WINGSandM;The Greek god Mercury, with winged staff, carried messages (real fast) to thegods.andP;  So does AIT's Mercury, only instead of messages, Mercury's speed is inrule firing.andP;  Mercury KBE is a multi-component, high-speed LISP-basedexpert-system shell.andP;  As shown in Figure 1, Mercury is a tidy bundle ofhigh-tech modules.andM;Fusion is the knowledge engineer's workbench permitting the developer to usea workstation approach to prototyping applications.andP;  Using a window-basedapproach with pull-down menus, Fusion provides an environment similar to theones so familiar to ART and KEE enthusiasts.andP;  Using Fusion, a developer canwrite, edit, compile and run a ruleset.andP;  For those novices among us, Mercurycomes complete with a menu option aptly named Examples.andP;  Since Mercury istouted as being turbo-speedy, it is not surprising that AIT has a utilityfunction smugly called run slow so developers can catch their breath as theydebug.andM;One of the nicer features I stumbled upon is the facts task that permits thedeveloper to browse through the known production-engine classes.andP;  Once aclass is chosen, a scrollable box is displayed that shows all of the objectsfor that class.andP;  For example, for the class customer, a window appears withcolumns for each of the objects contained within customer.andP;  customer__name,street, city, state, ZIP and preferred__customer columns all appear with theappropriate information in each column.andP;  Objects are editable by clicking ona box within the class window for the erase, edit or add functions.andP;  A resultof clicking on the edit or add functions will be a form that the user can useto enter or modify object information.andP;  What are objects?andP;  Webster'sdictionary gives a definitions the synonyms article, item, thing, entity andinstances.andP;  And, in fact, this is exactly what it means in AI.andO;Customer__name, city, and ZIP are all objects, items, or things.andP;  How theyare collected or organized is the fundamental basis for any object-orientedsystem.andM;MOS is the Mercury object system.andP;  Running in Common LISP, the object systemrepresents the state-of-the-art in expert systems today.andP;  Similar to but moreefficient than CLOS (Common LISP Object System), MOS focuses on run-time orimplementation efficiencies.andM;MOS has five categories of objects.andP;  Class objects and instance objects areour customer and ZIP entities.andP;  ZIP is an instance object contained withinthe class object customer.andP;  Objects are useless unless they are part of anoperation or a procedure; in object-oriented parlance a procedure is known asa method.andP;  In MOS the generic function object, while not the actual method,describes the function that determines the methods to be performed.andP;  A methodobject describes the algorithm that a generic function is to use.andP;  Last, butnot least, a collection object is a group of items for which genericfunctions are provided.andM;Mercury provides an extension to the object-oriented class entity with itsmetaclass feature.andP;  Metaclass provides the glue that binds together theobject system, their graphical representation, their relational databaseaccess methods, and the process of inferencing over these objects.andP;  CalledMOS-Class, it is not a separate Mercury package but is distributed throughoutthe Mercury system.andM;Objects aside, the ultimate end-user of the Mercury system notices the userinterface first.andP;  The presentation manager provides a nice Macitosh-likeapproach to menus, forms, scroll boxes, and dialog boxes.andP;  A rather niceapproach to viewing or editing objects is the form, which is anatural to anend-user.andP;  Forms contain fields, a menu-bar, user-specified control keys, anda settable message area.andP;  The size of the form and its placement arevariable, making this feature a powerful one.andP;  To get to a specific form, auser can be treated to a scroll-box that could list all of the forms the usermay be interested in.andP;  The user need only scroll to the desired form andclick.andP;  Macintosh, eat your heart out.andM;Mercury's component parts are wrapped around a high-speed production engine.andO;This engine contains the inferencing mechanism that attaches the objects tothe rules.andP;  The first step in running is to load the classes of objects to bereasoned about by the rules, step two is to load the rules.andP;  Typically, rulesand classes are defined as LISP constructs using the MLISP component ofMercury.andP;  The production engine rules and classes are loaded into the enginevia a file load when running.andP;  Listing I shows the LISP orientation of atypical class and rule construct.andM;No expert system is of any use without the ability to access corporate data.andO;Mercury provides the MSQL component that is designed to interfaceexpert-system programs to any SQL-compliant relational database-managementsystem.andP;  It provides an easy access to DEC's own Rdb and any SQL third-partydatabase.andP;  Although Mercury's command structure is LISP-oriented, the callsto SQL databases are sufficiently SQL-like to make SQL programmerscomfortable.andP;  This inquiry orders the employee table in last name, first nameorder: (SELECT (EMPLOYEE__ID LAST__NAME FIRST__NAME) (:FROM EMPLOYEES)(:ORDER-BY (LAST__NAME: ASCENDING) (FIRST__NAME: ASCENDING)))andM;Perhaps Mercury's most unusual feature is its ability to handle mountains ofclasses with maximum efficiency.andP;  Many shells on the marketplace have a setof limit on the amount of knowledge that may be processed, due to the designmechanism where all rules, objects, and so on are placed in memory.andP;  Mercuryusesits MSQL interface to relational databases to provide a multiuser stablestorage for knowledge.andP;  This feature provides the capability of storing asmany objects as necessary in the relational database architecture.andO;Conceivably then, an industrial-strength expert system with few capacitylimitations can be built.andM;Mercury is new in the field and has a small but impressive list of users.andO;One of the largest banks in the country uses Mercury to parse money-transfermessages from all over the world.andP;  The system developer, who is no slouchwhen AI is concerned, says that Mercury was the only product he evaluatedthat had the strength to tackle his very unorthodox problem.andM;NEXPERT OBJECT IS NEXTandM;About two years earlier out of the starting gate, Neuron Data's NexpertObject is already a popular and well-known tool.andP;  With hundreds of copies ofits PC version deployed around the world in places such as Chase ManhattanBank, NASA, Arthur Andersen, Exxon and Du Pont, Nexpert is the leadingcontender in the DEC marketplace.andP;  Vending a robust, object-oriented system,Neuron Data has its sights set on multiplatform leadership.andP;  With version forthe Macintosh, IBM PC, VAX, and an AI Server that will port to any host,expert systems can become truly distributed.andM;Nexpert Object is similar to Mercury in providing a full-featured tool thatfeatures objects, rules, links to relational databases, windowing, andmetaslots.andP;  In Nexpert, the elementary unit of knowledge the inference engineprocesses is the rule.andP;  Although the rule editor itself relies on filling ina syntax-dependent form (Figure 2), the process is modular.andP;  The addition ormodification of rules can be incremental, permitting a fully modularizedapproach rule-base development.andP;  Just like Mercury, you can click-click toyour heart's content in the windowed rule-editing environment.andM;One of Nexpert's nicest features is its ability to get under the skin of therule process and understand how each rule and its underlying hypotheses anddata are processed.andP;  The list of rules menu item lists all rules in the rulebase, and clicking on focus rule network gives the developer a graphic viewof each rule.andP;  Moving back to the central Nexpert menu we can click on theencyclopedia icon to access the rule elements in question through its dataand hypotheses notebooks.andP;  These notebooks are automatically built by Nexpertand are updated whenever conclusions are reached or new knowledge is added tothe system.andM;In the past, one of NExpert's drawbacks was its reliance on expensiveworkstation devices for a development environment.andP;  No longer.andP;  In April,Neuron Data announced a version of Nexpert for development on the X-windowsserver terminal.andP;  X-windows was developed by MIT and has become the standardfor UNIX-based bit-mapped windowing systems.andP;  The typical cost of an X-serverterminal is under $2,500, as opposed to a top-of-the-line workstation for$5,000-$50,000.andM;Always keen on new buzzwords, Nexpert provided me with a realdoozy--Knowcess, the process of inferencing.andP;  Nexpert provides the standardforward or data-driven approach as well as the backward or hypotheses-drivenapproach.andP;  Neuron Data recognized from the beginning that not all problemscould be solved with an or approach (that is, forward or backward chaining).andO;Instead, it provides the developer with an and approach, which they call themixed-mode approach.andP;  Although all of the shells discussed provide some formof mixed-mode rule processing, Nexpert's seems the most natural to use.andP;  Thismixed-mode method is employed when one knows about the symptoms and has anidea as to what the solutions might be.andM;This unique function is performed via clicking on the encylopedia icon.andP;  Onceinside, data can be entered by activating the list of data menu item.andP;  Afterentering all relevant data, we decide we might know what the problem is--wehypothesize or suggest.andP;  After closing the list of data screen we click onthe list of hypotheses menu item.andP;  From the pop-up menu we select suggest.andO;At this point Nexpert can run a Knowcess session using both the data weprovide and out intuitive hypothesis as to what the problem might be.andM;Our world is an uncertain one and often we have absolutely no idea what theproblem is and haven't a clue as to how to respond to a question.andP;  It isimportant that the tools we use to represent our problems contain referenceto this ambiguity.andP;  Nexpert can make assumptions about what the value of anunknown data element might be and draw inferences from there: IF IS enzymeNOTKNOWN THEN Assume__RNAse Let enzyme RNAseandM;Using default assumption rules is one way of handling an uncertain world.andO;Although Nexpert does not have built-in confidence factors or probabilitiesto handle these rules, the designer can self-program them into a session bycreating a rule that contains a formula.andP;  This is done through the conclusiondo statement: IF YES Evidence__C [is less than] = CFc 1 [is greater than] +CFc --1 THEN Hypothesis DO CFHHyp + (1-CFHyp) X (0.8 X CFc) CFHypandM;Given that it is almost certain the designer will, at some time or another,have to represent imprecise knowledge, represent uncertain inferences, oreven conflicting information, Nexpert offers this useful functionality.andM;Nexpert, like Mercury, has a very powerful object system.andP;  Interestingly,Nexpert can create objects from the right hand side of a rule: IF [is greaterthan] n O THEN HYPO1 CreateObject &quot;object&quot; \n\ class 1andM;Where n is an attribute and will be asked for by the system, Object is partof class 1.andP;  What can be created can be destroyed; the corollary toCreateObject is DeleteObject.andM;You can't have any better endorsement than NASA's use of Nexpert in the spaceshuttle program or DEC's selection of Nexbert as one its select DigitalDistributed Software (DDS) products.andM;LEVEL5: A LEVEL OF EXPERTISEandM;The little sister to Nexpert and Mercury is Information Builder's Level5.andP;  Iremember when Level5 was sold as Insight out of Melbourne, Fla.andP;  for the verycompetitive price of $95.andP;  It was my first expert-system shell and Igleefully ran it on my IBM PC.andP;  It was a good tool then and still gives a bigbang for the buck.andP;  With systems on the IBM PC and mainframe, Macintosh, andDEC VAX, Level5, like Nexpert, lends itself nicely to distributed computingacross diverse hardware platforms.andM;Because Level5 lacks object methodology, its rule structure must supportknowledge description with a very rich syntax.andP;  But despite its richness,Level5 is by far the easiest system to use.andM;Level5's simplicity has advantages in permitting end-users to build their ownsystems.andP;  Although Nexpert is touted as being simple enough for end-users,this technical user did not find it initially easy to use.andP;  In contrast,Level5 was ease incarnate.andP;  Their production rule language lets you expressknowledge with an English syntax: TITLE  Mortgage Advisor 1.andP;  Approvemortgage requests RULE For mortgage decision IF  Applicant's job is suitableOR  Applicant satisfies net worth requirement AND  Residency requirementshave been meet AND NOT  Credit in default THEN  Approve mortgage request RULEFor job suitabilityandM;The Level5 production engine supports forward-, backward-, and mixed-modechaining similar to Nexpert and Mercury.andP;  Level5 can support a whopping 8,500rules on an IBM PC.andP;  As in Mercury, Level5 can pursue goals in a logical andstructured manner through goal outlining and logical segmentation of rulebases, making it a good first tool for those hard-to-change MIS folks.andM;Perhaps Level5's most salient selling feature is the connection to anInformation Builders sister product--FOCUS.andP;  FOCUS is a fourth-generationreporting language that has become a standard in corporate MIS.andP;  The onlycompetitor so far in the expert system-to-4GL tie-in is AICorp's KBMS, whichlacks a DEC platform.andM;Level5, or its predecessor Insight 2, is being used in roles as diverse asassisting in selection of aircraft, finishing specifications, assisting inplanning and scheduling of software development projects, and approving loansfor a Big Eight accounting firm.andM;To every thing there is a season, and for every application there is one ormore expert-system shells.andP;  Mercury and Nexpert are neck-in-neck in terms offunctionality and richness; Level5 is a good starter tool or for thoseapplications that do not require the vigor of an object-orientedimplementation.andP;  This may change soon: a major announcement from InformationBuilders is expected concerning the company's orientation towardsobject-oriented expert systems.andM;KES: NOT LAST AND NOT LEASTandM;Software Architecture and Engineering (Software Aandamp;E), in Arlington, Va.,andO;markets a multiplatform tool has quietly gained a groundswell ofappreciation.andP;  The Knowledge Engineering System (KES) was chosen by the JetPropulsion Laboratory in April for the first expert system aboard the Voyagerspacecraft.andM;Visions of Klingons aside, KES offers a dual-mode system with two primaryinference engines.andP;  The Production Rules system provides rules that reasonabout objects, thereby providing a robust object-oriented environments.andP;  KESrules are backward chaining and easy to code.andP;  A rule to determine if a carmay enter the country in an export system could be coded as: Foreign Rule: ifOrigin Of Car = Europe and (Engine = diesel or Catalytic Converter = true)then Automobile Can Enter = trueandless;0.9andgt;.andP;  endif.andM;KES' object orientation allows for definitions of object classes similar toNexpert's and Mercury's.andP;  Like the rule syntax, class syntax is easy to learnand makes sense from a textual perspective.andP;  A class description of theobjects group persons can be defined as: classes: persons: attributes: Age:int[constraint: age ge 0] {question: &quot;What is your age?&quot;}.andP;  Siblings: truth.andO;% endclass.andP;  %andM;As in all object-oriented methodologies you have the ability to definegeneric rules, which saves a lot of time and money.andM;The next step up is the KES Hypothesize and Test (HT) inference engine.andP;  Usedmostly for scientific or manufacturing applications and emphasizingdiagnostic and classification problems, HT performs a reasoning processcalled abductive reasoning in which the conclusion is a likely explanation ofthe premises.andM;The HT knowledge base comprises exhaustive descriptions or manifestations ofa problem area.andP;  Software Aandamp;E's documentation gives the example of a carproblem.andP;  Easily diagnostic, the knowledge base is accessed to match anobserved manifestation to match an observed manifestation with a descriptionthat matches the manifestation (the match does not have to be exact).andP;  HTwill assign a symbolic certainty factor to an answer.andP;  These certainlyfactors are quite different from the numeric (between 0 and one) certaintyfactors assigned in the rules inference engine; KES' symbolic certaintyfactors express the fuzziness of the match.andP;  An exact match would beexpressed as A for always true; whereas a partial match might be expressed aM for moderate likelihood.andM;KES HT knowledge descriptions are coded like rules, with the if and thenomitted: dirty carburetor [description: engine = starting problems, frequentstalling; gas mileage = poor; performance = lacks power;] worn piston rings[description: gas mileage = poor; Exhaust = smoky; Oil Use = excessive;]andM;This system's user indicates that their problem is poor gas mileage.andP;  DuringHT's hypothesis segment the system matches to both dirty carburetor and wornpiston rings.andP;  During the test segment HT attempts to obtain further valuesfor the description's other elements (engine, performance, oil use, and soon).andM;Software Aandamp;E is bullish on KES.andP;  Originally written in LISP, KES wasrewritten in C for portability.andP;  KES runs on everything from a Sun to a DECto an IBM mainframe.andP;  The company was quick to spot the issues ofembeddability and performance, and their frequent updtes to KES reflect thisvision.andM;My choice?andP;  I'd pick the one that first the application.andM;Jessica Keyes is managing director of technology for the New York StockExchange.andP;  She is a frequent contributor to many technical publications andteaches a seminar called Getting Started in Expert Systems.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
