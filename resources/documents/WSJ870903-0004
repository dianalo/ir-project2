Although both parties have acknowledged being in negotiations, they agreed not to disclose the price. However, bankers put the price tag at about $38 million. Last year, MasterCard made an unsuccessful bid to buy Cirrus for $28 million.    MasterCard officials declined to confirm that an agreement had been reached, and Cirrus executives in Downers Grove, Ill., didn't return phone calls.    For millions of consumers, the purchase means access to a greater number of teller machines for conducting banking business and getting cash advances. Though details haven't been ironed out, users of the 17,300 Cirrus machines and MasterCard's 10,214 machines will be able to transact business using either system's machines. The teller machines in both networks are owned by hundreds of local banks.    MasterCard is owned by a large association of banks. Cirrus is owned by Mellon Bank Corp., Norwest Corp., NBD Bancorp, Bank of Montreal, Bay Banks Inc. and First Interstate Bancorp.    John Love, editor of Bank Network News, a Chicago-based publication, says the agreement &quot;adds tremendous utility&quot; to the two teller-machine systems. &quot;This certainly consolidates the industry. It should be a very powerful system.&quot;    MasterCard's chief competitor, Visa International Inc., has 14,200 teller machines. Last year, Visa paid $5 million to Plus System Inc., the second-largest shared teller-machine network, to give Visa member banks the option of becoming Plus members.    In addition to greater convenience for consumers, the MasterCard-Cirrus link brings the bank credit card industry a step closer to the debit card business, an area banks have longed to enter. Unlike credit cards, which give consumers a month or more to pay for retail purchases, debit cards immediately reduce a consumer's bank balance by the amount of the purchase. In the future, banking experts expect debit cards to become increasingly important as a form of payment.    Banks began forming nationwide teller-machine networks like Cirrus and Plus, as well as local networks, as conveniences for their customers who need to conduct banking business while traveling or during nonbusiness hours. By sharing teller machines in networks, the banks save the $40,000 to $70,000 that it costs to install a new machine. Networks like Cirrus don't own machines but merely provide the switching services to link bank-owned machines.    Generally, banks have been reluctant to invest in promoting the national networks. According to the Nilson Report, a Santa Monica, Calif.-based newsletter that follows the credit card industry, Cirrus and Plus together average 72 transactions a month for each teller machine in their networks. Overseas, the shared networks handle an even lower volume -- fewer than 20 transactions a month for each machine.    As a result, national shared networks generally haven't been profitable. The networks decline to disclose their finances. However, Mr. Love of Bank Network News said Cirrus showed a small profit last year.    Despite the current low volume of national shared network transactions, bankers and others feel the volume will rise dramatically in the years ahead.    With its financial resources and marketing skills, MasterCard is betting that it can generate sharp increases in transactions on the Cirrus network, while at the same time using its own data processing capabilities to cut Cirrus's overhead. Cirrus presently pays NBD Bancorp in Detroit to handle its data processing.    Though there are 31.9 million holders of MasterCards, not all have access to MasterCard's teller machines. The individual banks issuing the MasterCards determine whether or not to participate in the MasterCard teller machine network. </TEXT></DOC>
