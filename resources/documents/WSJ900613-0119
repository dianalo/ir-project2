I want democracy for my people,&quot; saysShoua Xiong. He speaks for what is perhaps the world's mostobscure anti-communist movement, an army of several thousandguerrillas who are risking their lives to overthrow theVietnamese-backed government of Laos.   The 40-year-old Mr. Xiong hopes that if the West remembersthis forgotten domino of Indochina, it might help his cause.He is a Lao resistance officer, who has just trekked intonorthern Thailand from an area inside Laos that he says isheld by his anti-communist guerrillas. A trim, short manwearing a light polo shirt and gray slacks, Mr. Xiong(pronounced &quot;Shong&quot;) pauses midway through our conversationto strip off his shoes and socks. &quot;Restless,&quot; he apologizesin his fluent English. &quot;Too much time in the jungle.&quot;   Mr. Xiong is one of the Hmong tribesmen who in the days ofthe Vietnam War fought in Laos under Gen. Vang Pao againstthe communist Pathet Lao. He says that when Laos wentcommunist along with Vietnam and Cambodia in 1975, he wasworking as an interpreter for the CIA. He fled with hisfamily to America, and like some 180,000 other Lao refugeesbecame a U.S. citizen. Settling in Milwaukee, he worked atsuch jobs as carpentry and typewriter repair.   He knew that back in Laos there were terrible eventstaking place. &quot;The brothers and sisters we left behind afterthe war, they've been tortured, murdered,&quot; says Mr. Xiong.It's a statement bolstered by human-rights reports and theflight since 1975 of more than 300,000 refugees -- almost 10%of the country's 3.5 million people. Vietnamese troops andadvisers, backed by the Soviet Union, helped to entrench thePathet Lao regime of Premier Kaysone Phomvihane -- who hasled the Lao Communist Party since its founding in 1955.   Starting in the late 1970s came reports that along withthe usual communist means of repression, Mr. Kaysone's regimewas using chemical weapons, the infamous &quot;yellow rain,&quot; tokill rebels inside Laos. The resistance was disorganized anddiscouraged. The world had not yet witnessed the overthrow ofa communist state. &quot;We thought most of the Free World hadforgot Laos,&quot; says a resistance spokesman, Xia Kao Vang.   Then came the uprisings in Burma in 1988, China lastspring, and finally the collapse last winter of communism inEastern Europe. Inspired by these events, the fragmented Laoresistance got together, and last December declared aprovisional government for a free Laos. Mr. Xiong returned toSoutheast Asia, and now commands some of the guerrilla forcesoperating inside Laos. They call themselves the LaoLiberation Army, or LLA. Most are Hmong, still led by Gen.Vang Pao.   Since December the LLA guerrillas have been carrying outthe fiercest attacks on Pathet Lao troops since 1975.Vientiane has been fighting back hard enough to imply that ittakes the resistance seriously. &quot;The Laos government has madeit a number one priority to try and make an offensive againstthe resistance movement,&quot; says a Western relief officialbased on the Thai side of the Mekong River.   The government offensive has included heavy shelling alongthe border, and air raids against resistance areas both nearthe Mekong River and deep inside northern Laos. According toa number of Western diplomats in Thailand, the governmentforces have been using artillery, high explosives and napalm.Mr. Vang, one of the resistance spokesmen, spreads out asheaf of photos showing bomb fragments, burned huts andscorched bodies. He says they were taken in Laos this Januaryafter an air attack on villages near the old northern capitalof Luang Prabang.   The resistance says the government also has been usingpoison gas. &quot;They are not just using bullets,&quot; says Mr.Xiong. &quot;They are using chemical weapons.&quot;   He adds that thousands of Vietnamese troops remain inLaos, &quot;some in Lao uniforms.&quot; Vientiane has denied this. Butother members of the resistance, as well as observers inThailand, say that the People's Army of Vietnam still fieldsan estimated 10,000 to 20,000 troops in Laos, and is stillfighting alongside the Pathet Lao. Citing Thai armyintelligence reports, a diplomat in Bangkok says, &quot;There's nodoubt that the PAVN was involved, both air and groundelements, in pounding the resistance in January.&quot;   Little of this war makes its way into the world news. Laoresistance tales tend to vanish in the jungles of Thai borderpolitics, which treats the Lao resistance as one more tool inthe craft of surviving while surrounded by nasty armies inBurma, Cambodia, Laos -- and the traveling troops of Vietnam.Guerrillas such as Shoua Xiong serve Thailand as a handy formof border defense. To that extent, says one Western diplomat,they get help: &quot;The Thai army is the godfather of the Laoresistance.&quot;   This diplomat adds, however, that the past year and a halfthe Thais have generally pulled back their support for theLao resistance, even as it has become more effective. ThaiPrime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan -- who will visitPresident Bush in Washington tomorrow -- has been sparringwith his own country's restive military. Part of the spatstems from his wish to improve Thailand's relations with itsneighbors, by replacing hostilities with trade. Over thereported misgivings of some Thai army officers, the Laoguerrillas have been shunted into a diplomatic no man's land.They are allowed to operate out of Thailand, provided they donot make too much noise about their activities and do notforce a showdown between the Thai and Laotian governments.   So the Lao resistance alternates between trying tobroadcast its new strength and flitting back to semi-secretsafe houses in Thailand or perilous camps inside Laos. OnDec. 5, in a grand bid for support, resistance members held aflag-raising ceremony on a hilltop a few miles inside Laos.There they announced their new provisional government. Theyinvited along a Bangkok-based reporter, Robert Karniol, whodescribed the event in the March International DefenseReview. He concluded, &quot;The Lao nationalists are riskingBangkok's ire and Vientiane's retribution, but they hold thata range of factors has recently combined to provide themtheir first opportunity in 15 years of silent struggle.&quot;   The resistance claims wide support among the people ofLaos. The Lao government in April banned all public rallies,apparently afraid that anti-government demonstrations mightbreak out. Resistance spokesmen say they have more than10,000 guerrilla fighters, and are getting defectors from thePathet Lao army. They also say they can call up reserves andfind shelter in villages where the Lao people are sick ofbeing overtaxed and ordered around by the state. This ringstrue, say Western diplomats, one of whom adds that the PathetLao have turned to air strikes against resistance areasbecause &quot;in many cases the Laotian army didn't cooperate&quot;with government orders.   Laos-watchers in Thailand doubt that on its own theresistance could soon topple the government. Some diplomatsin Bangkok think the resistance army may be much smaller thanits leaders claim. And its fighters are working with a motleyarsenal that ranges from World War II rifles to AK-47scaptured from the Pathet Lao.   But it looks like the resistance is also, as one diplomatsays, &quot;in this for the long haul&quot; -- not least for historicalreasons. Politics in Laos tends to split along ethnic lines.In this war, the basic factions are the highland and thelowland Lao.   Most of the resistance fighters are drawn from the Hmongethnic minority, a group of highland Lao whose ancestorsimmigrated to Laos from southern China about 200 years ago.They are a tough bunch; back in 1918-22 the Hmong rebelledwith some success against the taxes and conscript laborimposed by the French colonial government. Their name,&quot;Hmong,&quot; means &quot;free,&quot; but they are also known as the &quot;Meo,&quot;which means &quot;savage.&quot; Long before communism mauled Indochina,the Hmong already had their turf quarrels with the lowlandLao. These quarrels took on anti-communist overtones when theVietnam War spilled over into Laos along the Ho Chi Minhtrail.   Today, the Hmong still want an end to what one of themcalls &quot;Vietnamese law.&quot; Resistance spokesman Xia Kao Vangsays he and his colleagues &quot;want the country to change likeall countries change these days.&quot; Mr. Vang comes for aninterview in Bangkok armed with a yellow legal pad on whichhe's scribbled the crib note &quot;We need democracy.&quot; Like Mr.Xiong, he explains that the first goal of the resistance isto get the Vietnamese out of Laos. &quot;Then the Pathet Lao andwe can negotiate,&quot; says Mr. Vang.   This is where the resistance hopes the U.S. might offersome help. Beyond Thailand's jittery tolerance, and donationsfrom the Lao diaspora, the Lao guerrillas get little support.The Reagan-era policy of backing anti-communist guerrillas inplaces such as Afghanistan, Nicaragua and Cambodia was neverextended to Laos. Instead, the U.S. shuns all officialcontact with the Lao resistance. Washington prefers toburnish its links to the communist regime in Vientiane. Theidea seems to be that good U.S. relations with Laos mighthelp lure the neighborhood bully, Vietnam, toward liberalways. The official argument is that happy Lao communistsmight cooperate in fighting drug traffic and in yielding upprisoners of war, or their remains. This policy has flopped.   It's time for the U.S. to rethink its approach to thisresurgent war. Interviewed in Thailand's Ban Vinai refugeecamp near the Mekong River, a Lao resistance general, XiongLeng Xiong, asks: &quot;Do you have any help for us? We are in ahurry to change Laos.&quot; Asked what the U.S. government knowsabout these outcast freedom fighters, a State Departmentofficer in Washington lays out the official line, &quot;We're notinterested in knowing.&quot;   ---   Miss Rosett is editorial page editor of The Asian WallStreet Journal.</TEXT></DOC>
