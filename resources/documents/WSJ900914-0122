Testifying before the House Banking Committee, Mr.Greenspan endorsed the idea of raising banks'deposit-insurance premiums, a move that the administrationand an increasing number of lawmakers support.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Greenspan also reiterated that the Fed would probablylower interest rates if Congress and the administration reacha &quot;credible and enforceable&quot; agreement to reduce the federalbudget deficit. It was the first time the chairman has madesuch comments since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait sent oilprices soaring and heightened fears of resurgent inflation.   Government officials have grown increasingly anxious overthe health of the nation's banks in the wake of themultibillion-dollar thrift bailout. New alarms clanged thisweek when two congressional agencies warned that the federalinsurance fund that protects bank depositors was dangerouslylow.   But Mr. Greenspan said the banking industry is muchsounder than its sister thrift industry was several yearsago, when problems that led to the failure of thousands ofSandamp;Ls and the huge taxpayer bailout were beginning to fester.Banks' levels of capital are higher, he said, and bankingregulation is tougher. He also said bank assets areshorter-term than those of thrifts, allowing banks to moreeasily balance their borrowing costs with lending rates.   Consequently, the Fed chairman said, &quot;The chance of havingthe type of problems with banks that we have with thrifts isvery significantly lower.&quot;   But Mr. Greenspan agreed that the deposit-insurance fund&quot;is under stress&quot; with fund reserves, as a percentage ofinsured deposits, at a record low. He also said banks arethreatened by an increasing number of sour real-estate loansbrought on by a downturn in commercial real estate.   Mr. Greenspan said he would favor enhancing the FederalDeposit Insurance Corp.'s authority to borrow from theTreasury to cope with any shortages in the insurance fundwhile Congress is working on changes in deposit insurance.The FDIC currently has a $5 billion line of credit with theTreasury, but has never used it.   If insurance premiums are raised, Mr. Greenspan said,officials must take great care to set a level that wouldn'tpush some institutions into insolvency. He suggested theFDIC, which manages both bank and thrift deposit-insurancefunds, determine a new ceiling on insurance premiums. Thepremium on thrift deposits is 23 cents per $100 of deposits,and the premium for banks is set to rise 4.5 cents next yearto 19.5 cents per $100 of deposits.   The chairmen of the Banking committees, Sen. Donald Riegle(D., Mich.) and Rep. Henry Gonzalez (D., Texas), yesterdayintroduced bills that would give regulators the authority toraise bank deposit-insurance premiums.   There is no question that the insurance fund has led banksto take risks, knowing that the government would protecttheir deposit funds, Mr. Greenspan said. It has also keptdepositors from scrutinizing the soundness of theinstitutions they choose to house their money, he said.   Mr. Greenspan said raising the requirements for bankcapital and strengthening supervision of banks would &quot;go along way to eliminate excessive risk-taking by insuredinstitutions.&quot;   He expressed reservations about reducing the federalinsurance limit of $100,000 per account, another idea gainingpopularity. &quot;If we were starting from scratch, the boardbelieves it would be difficult to make the case thatdeposit-insurance coverage should be as high as its current$100,000 level,&quot; he said.   Nevertheless, banks, thrifts and millions of householdshave made decisions assuming the $100,000 coverage, he said.&quot;Should Congress decide to lower deposit-insurance limits, ameaningful transition period would be needed,&quot; he suggested.   Mr. Greenspan also said that in the past &quot;month or two&quot;banks may have &quot;gone over the line&quot; in restricting theirlending policies. Some banks have tightened lending standardsthis year, mostly in commercial real-estate loans, leading towidespread complaints of a credit squeeze. Mr. Greenspan hadbeen welcoming the increased prudence, and yesterdaymaintained: &quot;A substantial part of the pulling back is good,not bad.&quot;   Separately, Sen. Alan Dixon (D., Ill.) introducedlegislation that would require the Fed to pay into thebank-insurance fund interest on the $33 billion the industrykeeps in reserve at the Fed. The interest would provideroughly $2.5 billion annually to the insurance fund, whichcurrently stands at $13.2 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
