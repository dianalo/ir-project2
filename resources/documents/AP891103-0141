In Nicaragua, President Daniel Ortega canceled a 19-monthcease-fire with U.S.-supported Contra rebels who refused to accepta peace agreement that called for their demobilization.   In El Salvador, the rebel Farabundo Marti National LiberationFront suspended peace talks with the government after 10 peoplewere killed in the bombing of a union hall.   Both the moves this week were steps backward from agreementssigned by five Central American presidents Aug. 7 that called fordisbanding the Contras, dialogue between governments andguerrillas, and an end to outside support for guerrilla movements.   In the case of El Salvador, the peace talks foundered becausethe government and insurgent armies are both convinced they caneventually win a decade-old civil war.   ``What can be expected now is total war,'' said Aronette Diaz,leader of the leftist Nationalist Democratic Union in San Salvador.   She said the violence could become worse than the bloody days ofthe early 1980s, when up to 800 people a month were being killed,most of them by rightist death squads sponsored or tolerated by thearmed forces.   ``Ten years later, both armies are more experienced, stronger.The war has reached another level,'' said Ms. Diaz.   From the moment government and guerrilla representatives satdown to talk in Mexico in September, the two sides accused eachother of lacking the will to find a route to peace. Each contendedthe other was using the talks tactically to blame the other fortheir inevitable breakdown.   The Mexican session and a subsequent round of talks in CostaRica in October produced virtually no progress toward ending aconflict that has killed an estimated 70,000 people.   Rebel commander Eduardo Sancho said Tuesday's bombing of theNational Federation of Salvadoran Workers was ``the principalreason'' for suspending the talks. Ten people were killed and 29wounded in the blast, which he said ``marks a new line, a newpolitical moment'' similar to the early 1980s.   ``With the massacre ... the fascist dictatorship has beenunmasked. The only way being left open is the immediate taking upof arms,'' Sancho said Friday on the clandestine rebel RadioVenceremos.   In Nicaragua, as in El Salvador, a burst of optimism followedthe Aug. 7 agreements.   The Sandinistas called elections for Feb. 25, as promised.Fourteen opposition parties joined a coalition and nominated acandidate _ Violeta Chamorro _ to face Ortega. Voter registrationtook place.   But the Contras, who were not a party to the agreements, beganmoving troops back into Nicaragua from their camps in neighboringHonduras. They said they would observe the cease-fire and fightonly defensively but said there could be no peace without theirparticipation.   Ortega said he canceled the cease-fire because of an escalatingseries of Contra attacks in the last three weeks. He promised toforge ahead with the vote.   Sandinista forces immediately attacked Contra positions to achorus of criticism from the United States and other CentralAmerican nations, and there were hints that U.S. military aid tothe guerrillas might be renewed.   But the defiant Contras are small and isolated, and U.S.officials fear they will simply be wiped out by the much largerSandinista army. Even without their demobilization, the Sandinistascould then go ahead with elections without worrying about Contraviolence.   The union hall bombing in El Salvador came the day after urbanguerrillas attacked the defense ministry and headquarters of thejoint chiefs of staff with mortars, killing one person and wounding15.   President Alfredo Cristiani says it is impossible to predictwhen the rebels will be defeated. ``But there will come a pointwhen they'll find themselves very diminished and they will becomejust isolated terrorist groups,'' he said.   But four U.S. army colonels said in a report this year that theinsurgents, estimated at 7,000 full-time combatants and about twicethat many part-time fighters, were well-trained and highlymotivated. They concluded the rebels could keep the conflictstalemated ``indefinitely.''   The insurgents believe stalemate favors them _ that time is ontheir side.   The 56,000-member armed forces of the government is dependent onU.S. military aid, which has reached more than $800 million thisdecade. The rebels are confident the ``Yankees'' will eventuallytire of financing a tie and will be embarrassed by renewedright-wing violence.   ``If negotiations don't work out, we'll eventually win,'' said aguerrilla commander who used the nom de guerre Luis in a recentinterview. ``It's just a question of how high the human andmaterial cost will be.''</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Douglas Grant Mine, an Associated Presscorrespondent based in San Salvador, has been covering CentralAmerica for two years.</TEXT></DOC>
