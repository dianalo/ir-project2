Unable to cite any specific reasons for the drop, traders spoke of the continuing bearish market sentiment surrounding the currency.    &quot;There's a general feeling that pervades the market that the dollar is weak,&quot; Frank Christie, a vice president at Chase Manhattan Bank, New York, said. &quot;There's concern about the trade deficit, concern about the budget deficit.&quot;    Douglas Madison, a corporate trader at BankAmerica International in New York said, &quot;The foreign exchange market is doing what it has to do. It believes the dollar belongs at a lower level.&quot;    In late New York trading, the dollar stood at or near its intraday lows. It was quoted at 1.8085 West German marks and 141.73 Japanese yen, compared with 1.8245 marks and 142.95 yen late Wednesday. The British pound rose to $1.6303 from $1.6175 a day earlier.    Dealers said the U.S. currency yesterday sank through two so-called resistance points on technical traders' charts when it dropped below 1.8200 marks and then below 1.8110 marks. At both levels, &quot;there were liquidations of dollar positions,&quot; Robert J. Franklin, a vice president at Salomon Brothers Inc. in New York, said.    Dealers also said that in late European activity and through most of the North American trading day, the dollar stayed below 142 yen, a level at which the Bank of Japan had been intervening in the Tokyo market the past few days.    The Bank of Japan was reported to have purchased a small amount of dollars early in the Tokyo market. There were rumors that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York intervened in the U.S. market, but many traders discounted them.    In early trading today in Tokyo, the dollar was quoted at 141.70 yen as traders said there was further Bank of Japan intervention to support the currency.    Trading in the U.S. was fairly active, dealers said. But Chase Manhattan's Mr. Christie said: &quot;There's not much multinational (corporate) business. It's still mostly intermarket business.&quot;    Traders said many U.S.-based multinational corporations are settling foreign currency payments as soon as they come due. But they are delaying conversions of foreign receivables to U.S. currency, betting that they will get more dollars for their foreign exchange as the dollar weakens.    Despite the negative market attitude toward the dollar, traders have been cautious about driving the currency down and seem to be inching it only slowly toward 140 yen and 1.80 marks.    &quot;It seems like every morning we come in, we see a lower dollar -- by one pfennig, one yen,&quot; Mr. Christie said. But, he said, &quot;I'm sure we'll see some intervention at those levels; we'll see most members of the G-7 (the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Canada and Italy) come in, not just the Bank of Japan -- at least the (West German) Bundesbank and the Fed.&quot;    Japan's central bank has intervened periodically during the dollar's fall from its Aug. 14 levels of 152 yen and nearly 1.90 marks. But the Bundesbank has been notably inactive during that time, and the U.S. has basically limited itself to dollar-supporting comments from senior officials such as Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter and Federal Reserve Board Governor Robert Heller.    Yesterday in Austria, Mr. Heller reportedly said the U.S. shouldn't depend solely on declines in the dollar to narrow its trade deficit and improve the competitiveness of U.S. industry. It was his second statement on the dollar and trade in two days. Mr. Yeutter said Tuesday that he doesn't want to see the dollar sent lower to try to narrow the U.S. trade deficit.    Some traders said the U.S., in particular, is in a political bind. They said the Reagan administration can't afford to be seen by protectionist-minded congressmen as spending large amounts to prop up the dollar while the U.S. continues to show huge trade deficits.    Instead, some analysts say the Fed is letting market-driven higher interest rates slow the dollar's decline. Higher U.S. interest rates would tend to make dollar-denominated investments more attractive.    &quot;We have a very subtle tightening of monetary policy in the U.S.,&quot; Mr. Madison said. &quot;They're allowing interest rates to slowly move higher.&quot;    For example, since mid-July, the federal funds rate, or the rate banks charge one another for overnight cash, has climbed to 6.88% from 6.52%, and six-month Treasury bill rates have risen to 6.28% from 5.54%.    &quot;The Fed is allowing market interest rates to rise to break the dollar's fall,&quot; Mr. Madison said. The market, he said, sees that Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan's response to a weaker dollar is &quot;to do nothing to increase liquidity in the market.&quot;    Mr. Franklin of Salomon Brothers said, &quot;The lack of noticeable central bank buying of dollars has left a lot of people to conclude they're going to raise interest rates as the next line of defense.&quot;    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for delivery this month settled at $455.40 an ounce, down $1.90. Estimated volume was a moderate 3.7 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $456.45 an ounce in early trading today in Hong Kong.    ---                     LATE NEW YORK TRADING                    Thursday, Aug. 27, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
