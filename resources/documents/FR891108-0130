The Spectrum Fund is a no-load, open-end management investment companythat is organized as a Maryland corporation with series capability. TheSpectrum Fund will only invest in shares of certain Price Funds, and, fortemporary defensive purposes, money market instruments. The Price Fundsare no-load, open-end investment companies that operate without 12b-1 plans.2. Price Associates is a publicly held company and registered as an investmentadviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Investment Servicesis a registered broker-dealer and Price Services is a registered transferagent, under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Both are wholly-ownedsubsidiaries of Price Associates.3. Shares of the Spectrum Fund will be offered and sold only to small individualinvestors investing primarily through tax-advantaged retirement accountsorganized under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code but also throughother accounts established for long-term investment purposes. The SpectrumFund is designed to provide a simple cost-effective response to investordemand for broad diversification through investments in two specific fundportfolios with differing objectives. When combined with savings on retirementfiduciary fees, Spectrum Fund would likely be a less expensive investmentalternative for Price Fund shareholders who invest through retirement plans.4. The Spectrum Fund will consist of two portfolios: the Growth Fund andthe Income Fund (the ``Portfolios''). The Growth Fund will invest in fivePrice common stock funds; the Income Fund will invest in five Price bondfunds; and both Portfolios will invest in a Price equity income fund anda Price money-market fund (collectively, with any other Price Fund in whichthe Growth Fund and the Income Fund could invest in, the ``Underlying Funds'').5. The initial allocation of assets will be determined by Price Associatesand will be adjusted periodically in accordance with quantitative and analyticalanalyses administered by Price Associates. Further, fundamental analysisalso will be applied to the allocation process and used by the officersof Spectrum Fund to make the allocation decisions. Each Portfolio of theSpectrum Fund will allocate its assets among the Underlying Funds in accordancewith predetermined percentage ranges. For the Income Fund, these rangeswill be:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,s50,10</C> <H1>Fund </H1><H1>Investment range (percent of income fund assets)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Prime Reserve Fund <D>5-30</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Short-Term Bond Fund <D>0-15</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">New Income Fund <D>15-30</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">GNMA Fund <D>5-20</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">High Yield Fund <D>10-25</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">International Bond Fund <D>5-20</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Equity Income Fund <D>10-25</D></ITAG></ITAG>For the Growth Fund, the ranges will be:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,s50,10</C> <H1>Fund </H1><H1>Investment range (percent of equity fund assets)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Equity Income Fund <D>5-20</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Growth and Income Fund <D>5-20</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">New Era Fund <D>10-25</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Growth Stock Fund <D>15-30</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">New Horizons Fund <D>10-25</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">International Stock Fund <D>5-20</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Prime Reserve Fund <D>0-25</D></ITAG></ITAG>As matters of fundamental policy, the Underlying Funds or the percentageranges may only be changed by shareholder vote. Neither the Growth Fundnor the Income Fund will be able to purchase shares of any Price Fund if,as a result of such purchase, they would hold in the aggregate more thanfifteen percent of any class or classes of the outstanding securities ofthat fund. The difference between the upper limit and the lower limit ofthe percentage range may be no greater than fifteen percent, except fortemporary investments in a money market fund.6. The expenses of the Spectrum Fund will be minimal. Price Associateswill charge no advisory fee. However, shareholders of each Portfolio willindirectly pay their proportional share of the advisory fees and expensespaid by shareholders of the Underlying Funds. Under the advisory fee structurefor the Price Funds, the creation and operation of the Spectrum Fund, tothe extent it attracts additional assets to the Price Funds, will reducethe ``group'' fee component of Price Fund advisory fees and, thus, reducethe expense ratio of the Underlying Funds.\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Under a partial group fee arrangement, the advisory feedue Price Associates is split into two components_a ``group'' fee and an``individual fund'' fee. The group fee is based on the combined net assetsof all of the Price Funds distributed by Price Services other than certaininstitutional and private label products. Each Price Fund pays, as itsportion of the group fee, an amount equal to the ratio of its daily netassets to the daily net assets of all Price Funds. The individual fundfee is based on the net assets of that Price Fund and recognizes the differentcharacteristics of each fund, the degree and skill required to manage eachfund and the relative value that can be, and has been, added by that fund'sinvestment adviser.7. Price Services will act as the shareholder servicing agent for the SpectrumFund and arrange for all other services necessary for the operation ofthe Spectrum Fund. All expenses (shareholder servicing, legal, accounting,etc.) will be paid for in accordance with a Special Servicing Agreement(the ``Agreement'') to be entered into between and among the Spectrum Fund,the Underlying Funds and Price Services. The Agreement will generally requirethe Spectrum Fund to pay for services to be rendered by Price Servicesand reimburse Price Services for payments for services obtained from otherpersons, except to the extent those service fees and payments, or a portionof them, are paid by the Underlying Funds.8. The Board of Directors/Trustees of an Underlying Fund will determinewhether the aggregate expenses of the Spectrum Fund are greater than orless than the estimated savings to the Underlying Fund from the operationof the Spectrum Fund. If the aggregate financial benefits to the UnderlyingFunds exceed the costs of the Spectrum Fund, there will be no charge tothe Spectrum Fund for the services under the Agreement. The expenses willbe passed through to the Underlying Funds in proportion to the averagedaily value of each Underlying Fund's shares held by each Portfolio, providedfurther that no Underlying Fund will bear such expenses in excess of theestimated savings to it. If the aggregate financial benefits to the UnderlyingFunds do not exceed the costs of the Spectrum Fund, the Spectrum Fund willpay that portion of costs determined to be excessive.9. The determination of whether and the extent to which the benefits willexceed the costs will be based on a cost-benefit analysis set forth inthe application and summarized below. The Directors/Trustees for each UnderlyingFund, prior to authorizing its fund to be a party to the Agreement, willreview and approve or disapprove the cost-benefit analysis and review annuallyits continued appropriateness for each Underlying Fund. In making thesedeterminations, the Directors/Trustees will consider such factors as theyapply to each Underlying Fund as: the amount of Spectrum Fund expensesto be absorbed by each Underlying Fund; the amount of assets invested ineach Underlying Fund by the Spectrum Fund; the average and median accountsizes for the Underlying Fund and Spectrum Fund; the rate at which variableexpenses are incurred by Spectrum Fund and Underlying Funds; and the rateat which fixed expenses are incurred by Spectrum Fund and by UnderlyingFunds. The Directors/Trustees will also consider the extent to which investorsin Spectrum Fund would have purchased one or more of the Underlying Funds;the extent to which an investment in Spectrum Fund represents a consolidationof or reduction in the rate of increase in the number of accounts in theUnderlying Funds; and the extent to which accounts in Spectrum Fund representexchanges from the Underlying Funds or new investments.10. Based on actual expense data from the Underlying Funds and certainconservative assumptions with respect to the Spectrum Fund, Applicantsbelieve that the costs arising from the existence and operation of theSpectrum Fund will be fully offset by benefits which are presumed to begenerated for the Underlying Funds and directly inure to such Funds. Theexpenses of the Spectrum Fund may be divided into two groups_fixed andvariable. The fixed expenses of the Spectrum Fund, which include accounting,legal, registration, directors' fees, and organizational costs, are expectedto be less than the average of such expenses for the Underlying Funds.This is primarily due to the Portfolios' investment policies which arelimited to the purchase and sale of shares in the Underlying Funds. Thevariable expenses, which relate to shareholder servicing such as transferagency costs and the costs of mailing and printing prospectuses, shareholderreports, and proxies, are expected to be at the same rate as such expensesincurred on average for the Underlying Funds. However, the proposed arrangementis expected to create economies to the Underlying Funds due primarily toa reduction in the shareholder servicing costs to the Underlying Fundsof servicing the Spectrum Fund.\2\<NOTE/> The relatively low fixed costs of the Spectrum Fund and theanticipated net savings generated by the Spectrum Fund for the UnderlyingFunds will effectively create a zero expense ratio for the Spectrum Fund.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ A comparison of the shareholder servicing costs whichthe Underlying Funds would bear as a result of an investment through theSpectrum Fund with the shareholder servicing costs of direct investmentby shareholders holding accounts of average size demonstrates the economiesassociated with the proposal. For example, Applicants assume that the $100million invested in the Income Fund would result in 8,800 shareholders(based on the average account size of $11,400 of the Underlying IncomeFunds). Assuming that each of the 8,800 shareholders in the Income Fundwould invest, in its absence, in any two of the Underlying Funds for atotal of 17,600 accounts would result in the Underlying Income Funds bearingapproximately $625,000 in shareholder servicing costs annually. This compareswith virtually no shareholder servicing costs to the Underlying IncomeFunds with respect to an investment of $100 million (because the IncomeFund would open only two accounts in the Underlying Income Funds). Thus,the excess of benefits ($625,000) over costs ($426,000) to the UnderlyingIncome Funds would be $199,000.11. Apart from expected savings to the Underlying Funds, the Spectrum Fundwill also create direct expense-saving benefits for the various retirementplan shareholders. Spectrum Fund retirement plan shareholders will payonly one $10 annual fiduciary fee for each Portfolio of the Spectrum Fund,rather than two to seven times this amount depending on the number of UnderlyingFunds in which they otherwise would have directly invested.<ITAG tagnum="84">Applicants' Legal Analysis</ITAG>A. Section 12(d)(1)1. Under sections 12(d)(1) (A) and (B), the Spectrum Fund generally couldnot purchase (and the Underlying Funds could not sell), without an exemptiveorder, more than three percent of the outstanding voting securities ofan Underlying Fund, securities issued by each Underlying Fund having anaggregate value in excess of five percent of the value of the total assetsof the Spectrum Fund, or securities issued by each Underlying Fund havingan aggregate value in excess of ten percent of the value of the total assetsof the Spectrum Fund.2. Section 12(d)(1) is intended to prevent the pyramiding of investmentcompanies, the layering of fees, and undue organizational complexities.Applicants represent that none of the negative effects associated withfund holding companies are present with respect to the proposed arrangementand that the Spectrum Fund will provide the benefits of diversificationand account cost savings to small and retirement-oriented investors. SpectrumFund shareholders will not be subject to two advisory fees, distributioncosts, directly or indirectly, or a sales load. Applicants represent thatconcerns under section 12(d)(1) regarding the largely illusory value ofdiversification and ``wash transactions'' that achieve no investment purposeare answered by the differing investment objectives of the two portfoliosand monitoring of ``wash transactions.'' \3\<NOTE/> Wash transactions will be monitored on a periodic basis,including the use of a computer assisted program. In addition, where suchtransactions indicate that a particular asset class (<T3>e.g.</T3>, small cap stocks or high dividend paying stocks) held bythe Growth or Income Fund is over-represented, holdings of that asset classwill be reduced. Congress' concern about concentration of control and undueinfluence will be minimized because the Spectrum Fund will ``mirror'' voteits shares in each Underlying Fund, has agreed to limitations on its redemptionrights, and will not acquire more than fifteen percent in the aggregateof any Underlying Fund. Finally, the inherent conflicts of interest aremitigated by separate, independent boards of directors for the SpectrumFund and the Underlying Funds.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ A ``wash transaction'' is one in which one UnderlyingFund would buy the same security that another is selling, thus burdeningthe fund holding company with brokerage costs for a transaction that achievesno investment purpose.B. Section 17(d)1. Because the Spectrum Fund and the Underlying Funds are each advisedby Price Associates, the Spectrum Fund and the Underlying Funds could bedeemed to be affiliates of one another. Applicants seek an order undersections 6(c), 17(d) and Rule 17d-1 to permit the Spectrum Fund to enterinto a joint arrangement pursuant to the special servicing agreement (<T3>see</T3> paragraphs 7-10 above). Applicants believe that the proposedtransactions are structured to assure that the participation of the SpectrumFund, the Underlying Funds, Price Associates, and Price Services is advantageousto all the Applicants and is not on a basis less advantageous or differentfrom those of the other Applicants.2. Each Underlying Fund will bear expenses of the Spectrum Fund only tothe extent such expenses are less than the benefits of the Spectrum Fundto each Underlying Fund. The payment of Spectrum Fund expenses by any UnderlyingFund will be reviewed and approved by that fund's board of directors/trustees,including a majority of the independent directors/trustees, all of whomare unaffiliated with the independent directors of Spectrum Fund. Thus,the Underlying Funds will each participate in the arrangement on an equitablebasis. The Spectrum Fund, by paying its proportionate share of the expensesof the Underlying Funds, will also participate with the Underlying Fundson an equal basis.C. Section 17(b)Purchases by Spectrum Fund of the shares of the Underlying Funds and thesale by the Underlying Funds of their shares to Spectrum Fund could bedeemed to be principal transactions between affiliated persons under section17(a). Therefore, Applicants seek an order under sections 6(c) and 17(b)exempting Applicants from the provisions of section 17(a) to permit thePrice Funds to sell their shares to the Spectrum Fund. Applicants believethat such relief should granted for the same reasons set forth under thediscussion of sections 12(d) and 17(d).<ITAG tagnum="84">Applicants' Conditions </ITAG>If the requested order is granted, Applicants agree to the following conditions:<ITAG tagnum="21">1. Shares of the Spectrum Fund will be offered and sold (includingsales by exchanges or transfers between the Portfolios) only to individualsinvesting through tax-advantaged retirement accounts organized under theprovisions of the Internal Revenue Code (and distributions therefrom) andto individuals investing through other accounts established for long-terminvestment purposes (collectively, ``Long-Term Investors''), in both casessubject to an aggregate $30,000 investment limit during any one calendaryear. Appropriate procedures and controls will be instituted to ensurethe Spectrum Fund is limited to such Long-Term Investors. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. Spectrum Fund will operate under a fundamental investment policyof allocating its assets to specified Underlying Funds according to a scheduleof percentage ranges; changes in either an Underlying Fund or a percentagerange must be submitted to shareholders for approval.
