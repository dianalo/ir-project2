The current capacity ofthe 17 units is 1137 megawatts. This paper discusses briefly some ofthe operating problems, mainly environmental, encountered throughoutits 25-year history. Reinjection of the boron-containing condensate intothe field as an envoironmental measure proved helpful in regeneratingthe thermal reservoirs to some extent. Noise pollution from the ventingof steam was eliminated with the use of mufflers. Hydrogen sulfide emissionsare controlled by use of the Stretford process. Change rooms, showers,and laundry facilities have been added to ensure occupational safetyof maintenance personnel from such impurities as mercury and arsenic.A geothermal hazardous waste project has recently begun to investigatereduction and improved handling of such materials.</TEXT></DOC>
