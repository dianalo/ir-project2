Its array of weapons includes a nuclear-powered submarine,aircraft carriers, MiG-29 fighter planes and recently acquiredmedium-range ballistic missile capability. Indian and Westernmilitary analysts say the country is developing a power projectionwell beyond the Asian Subcontinent.   The nation of 880 million people has 1.36 million men in uniform,the world's fourth-largest force in terms of manpower after theSoviet Union, China and the United States.   The 115,000-man air force with 870 planes ranks behind only theUnited States and the Soviet Union in the crucial field of heavycombat airlift capability.   India also has been one of the world's largest arms importerssince 1986.   More than 25,000 scientists and engineers are working in 15laboratories and 60 research centers on hundreds of major weapons,electronics and other defense-related developments. The governmentis spending $1 billion a year on research and developments projectsalone.   ``India is developing such a military might, especially in theair force and navy, that it is amounting to giving notices tosuperpowers that their roles in the region are subject to check,''said the Western military expert, who represents a NATO and wouldspeak only on conditiion of anonymity.   On May 22, India successfully test-fired its first-medium rangeballistic missile, becoming only the seventh nation in the worldwith the demonstrated ability to make its own ballistic missiles.   The 1.2 million-man army is adding four new divisions to theexisting 34 _ an increase of 80,000 combat soldiers.   Indigenous weapons already tested or under development includelight combat aircraft, pilotless aircraft, cluster bombs,high-altitude parachutes, light field guns, main battle tanks,armored personnel carriers, advanced panoramic sonar to detect enemysubmarines, variable depth sonar, homing torpedoes, anti-submarineelectric torpedoes, mines and mine-breaching equipment and a newrange of small arms and wheeled vehicles.   India is also building a superport in the southern state ofKarnataka for developing submarines and ships, including its own30,000-ton aircraft carrier.   A long-range reconnaissance aircraft, capable of patrolling asfar as Australia and Africa, is in the planning stage.   India is the only country outside the Soviet bloc to haveacquired the Soviet Union's latest MiG-29 fighters. Negotiations areunder way to build MiG-29s in India.   India's two aircraft carriers give the 53,000-man navy aconstantly available fixed-wing seaborne air power.   ``Given the vast coastline (3,525 miles) the naval strength isnot much, but at least we have a blue-water navy now,'' said aDefense Ministry official, speaking on condition he not beidentified.   ``Our aim is to be self-sufficient. We are not gearing our armedforces for battle. It is just the opposite. We believe all thesewill work as deterrents.''   India has fought three wars with neighboring Pakistan sinceindependence from Britain in 1947. But its biggest rival in theregion is China with whom it fought a border war in 1962 and lostterritory.   The Indian navy has 14 submarines, including a nuclear-poweredsub leased from the Soviet Union, and it is trying to lease threemore nuclear-powered subs from the Soviets.   India's most recent achievement was the test firing of themedium-range Agni missile, named for the Hindu fire god.   The missile has a range of 1,550 miles, capable of reaching Chinain the east and as far west as Iran. The two-stage rocket candeliver a one-ton payload _ enough to carry a nuclear warhead,according to Indian military experts.   India exploded a nuclear device 15 years ago but insists itsnuclear program is for peaceful purposes. Western military expertssay, however, Indian scientists could assemble a nuclear warhead ina week's time.   The Agni test capped a missile development program that startedin 1983.   However, the Western military expert said it would be yearsbefore India could put its capabilities to use.   ``It is one thing to develop something, but another to use it,''he said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Tues PMs June 123</NOTE></DOC>
