Higgins.   Bush expressed his gratitude in a meeting with Egypt's newdefense minister, Youssef Sabry Abu-Taleb.   ``The phone calls were well received. ... He's been so helpfulto us in so many ways,'' the president said at the outset of anOval Office meeting.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said later the defenseminister brought a message from Mubarak ``dealing with the currentsituation in the region'' and offering ``to help in any way that hecould.''   He said Bush discussed the continuing U.S. ``concern aboutregional security, including Libya,'' and, in a brief discussion ofthe hostages, ``reiterated his desire for a definitive accountingof Lt. Col. Higgins and his concern for the safety and release ofthe hostages.''   Eight Americans are being held by terrorist groups in Lebanon.   FBI experts concluded Monday that a videotape released by oneterrorist group in Beirut last week does show Higgins dead.   Abu-Taleb spent 15 to 20 minutes with Bush, and left the WhiteHouse without stopping to answer reporters' questions.   Bush personally called many world leaders last week to seektheir help when terrorists were threatening to kill a secondAmerican hostage, Joseph Cicippio. They suspended the threat onThursday under intense international pressure.   Abu-Taleb is on his first visit to the United States to conferwith top U.S. officials since being named to the military post in asurprise move by Mubarak four months ago. He replaced Field MarshalAbdel-Halim Abu-Ghazala after eight years in the office.</TEXT></DOC>
