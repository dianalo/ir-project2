<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-03-0260 </DOCNO><TEXT>Blast vibration monitoring will be performed in the Exploratory ShaftFacility (ESF) to measure the vibration produced by constructed blastingduring shaft excavation. The monitoring will record the particle velocitygenerated by the construction blasts and will provide data to determineif the vibration design specifications for the shaft instrumentationand lining have been exceeded. Blast vibration monitoring will be limitedto the measurement of the three orthogonal components of motion usingseismometers located in each shaft. Monitoring shall be done in conjunctionwith the shaft uphole seismic testing. 3 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
