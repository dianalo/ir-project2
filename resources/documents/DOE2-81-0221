Studies of several commercially availableacid retarders revealed that some functioned by depositing hydrophobicfilms on carbonate surfaces while others were foaming agents which stabilizeda carbon dioxide form a barrier on the rock surface. In the absence offilter cake development, viscosity imparted by the addition of gellingagents had little effect on the reaction rate. Emulsification of acidwas shown to reduce reaction rate with the greatest retardation providedby oil-external acid emulsions.</TEXT></DOC>
