Officials at the space center on the northeastern shoulder ofSouth America called the launch ``a complete success.''   The countdown had been stopped for 15 minutes at 8:37 p.m.because of bad weather conditions.   ``A storm cloud passed over the launching pad,'' a space agencyofficial said. The countdown was resumed at 8:52 p.m. and therocket lifted off at 8:58 p.m.   Sixteen minutes and 40 seconds later, the InternationalTelecommunications Organization satellite separated from therocket, according to the official.   The agency said the flight was ``nominal,'' or perfect, exceptfor the brief weather problem.   New French Premier Michel Rocard watched the operation from thespace agency's facility in suburban Paris.   Four of the previous 21 Ariane shots were unsuccessful. Afailure in 1986 grounded the program for more than a year, but thelast three launches have been a success, including the previous oneon March 12.   The Intelsat V-F13 satellite put into geostationary orbit 22,500miles above the Earth is part of a series of 15 satellites built byan international consortium headed by Ford Aerospace. The satellitecontains 15,000 telephone circuits and two television channels.   Tuesday's launch involved an Ariane 2 rocket.   On a nearby pad other crews are preparing for the first launchof the larger Ariane 4 rocket that can carry 4.2 tons into orbit _nearly double the Ariane 2 payload. The Ariane 4 launch isscheduled for June 8.   The European Space Agency now has 44 launches on its orderbooks. It plans a total of eight in 1988 and nine in 1989 and 1990.   Ariane launches cost between $53 million and $105 million,depending on the version.</TEXT></DOC>
