 There are some ways ofassuring that the people at the service bureau understand andadhere to the designer's instructions.andP;  First, it is important toprovide the bureau with a copy of the finished laser output and alist of the font names and styles of all the type in the document.andO;For any PostScript fonts that are used, install screen fonts thatmatch them.andP;  Users can also avoid problems, after they are certainthat the document is perfect, by going through the normal printingsteps but pressing Command-F before clicking the final OK in thePrint dialog box.andP;  This will result in a PostScript text file thatthe service bureau can print without needing the application.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Service BureausDocument PreparationCustomer RelationsLayoutTutorialDesktop publishing.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>The Law of the LetterandM;You've produced a document with one of the popular page-layout programs.andO;You've used several spectacular fonts, your layout looks great on the screen,and LaserWriter proofs confirm that all is well.andP;  You're now ready to have itproduced at typeset quality on the Linotronic of a perhaps distant servicebureau.andP;  The process is often seamless and painless.andP;  Unfortunately,misconceptions, miscommunications, and misadventures can occur.andP;  Fontselection is one of the main reasons that the output you've so carefullydesigned and printed on your system can produce different printed results onanother.andP;  Here's how to smooth the transition and get what you expect.andM;First, provide your servicoe bureau with a copy of the finished laser output.andO;Many service bureaus complain that customers don't do this.andP;  Without suchproofs, they have to work blind, guessing at what you want.andP;  They can easilyrun your job without error indications and yet get output very different fromwhat you expect.andM;Give the personnel at your service bureau a list of the font names and stylesof all type in your document.andP;  It lets them check that all the fonts arepresent and available on their system.andP;  It also alerts them to potentialfont-numbering conflicts; bureaus familiar with such problems can take stepsto prevent them.andP;  Many keep a list of problem fonts, particularly thosecreatd with duplicate font numbers, and can advise you on how to organize andharmonize your own fonts (see &quot;Fonts by Number,&quot; July '89).andM;For any PostScript fonts you use, install screen fonts that match them.andP;  Manyservice bureaus can provide screen versions of the type styles they offer.andO;Alternatively, most font manufacturers -- including Adobe and Bitstream --provide screen fonts either gratis or at a nominal charge.andM;Fonts such as New York, Chicago, Geneva, and Monaco have been designed forlegibility on a 72-dot-per-inch screen, but they're bit-mapped screen fontswith no PostScript equivalents.andP;  On a LaserWriter, if you choose FontSubstitution, Helvetica, Courier, and Times PostScript will be substitutedfor Geneva, Monaco, and New York.andP;  These surrogates will print at the size(s)you've specified, but because their printed word spacing exactly matchestheir on-screen word spacing, the results will be either too dense or toosparse -- and generally ugly.andM;With all other font choices, whether or not you've selected FointSubstitution, if the LaserWriter has no corresponding resident font and yoursystem has no matching downloadable PostScript font, you'll get a replica ofthe screen font that will be as jagged as what you see onscreen.andP;  If theservice bureau doesn't have a PostScript font that you've specified in yourdocument, its system will issue an error message and substitute Courier,which is seldom the best alternative but helps ensure detection of the error.andO;To be doubly safe, always use PostScript fonts and always disable FontSubstitution.andM;Here are two sure ways to avoid service-bureau font problems: When yourdocument is final and perfect, go through the normal printing steps but pressCommand-F before clicking on the final OK in the Print dialog box.andP;  Insteadof hard copy, you'll get a PostScript text file that your service bureau canprint without the need for either the application that produced your documentor its fonts.andP;  That information is all embedded in your PostScript file.andP;  Ifyour proofing printer is something other than a LaserWriter, however, youmust be sure to have the LaserWriter and Laser Prep drivers in your Systemfolder, and you must have selected the nonexistent LaserWriter as yourprinter in the Chooser for this procedure to work.andP;  Unfornately, thisinsurance has its cost, because your file will be huge if it includes even afew PostScript fonts other than the 35 built into most PostScript-compatibleprinters.andP;  If you foresee possible last-minute edits at the bureau, include acopy of your document in its native format, because there's no simple way toedit a pure PostScript file.andP;  If this approach sounds inappropriate to you,try the next method.andM;Use Font/DA Mover to transfer all but the mandatory four fonts from yourSystem file into one suitcase that your System opens automatically onstartup, using either Suitcase or MasterJuggler.andP;  Give your service bureauboth your document and your font suitcase.andP;  The people there will know toprint your file with only your suitcase open.andP;  If you use PostScript fontsthat your service bureau doesn't have, you must include these font files inyour electronic package.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
