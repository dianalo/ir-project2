On other markets, platinum futures surged while gold and silverwere mixed; energy futures fell; grains and soybeans advanced;livestock and meat were mixed; and stock-index futures retreated.   The thinly traded contract for November delivery of copperreached $1.4775 a pound, well above the 1{-week-old record Comexhigh of $1.465, and settled at $1.4740, 2.95 cents higher thanFriday's final price. December copper finished at $1.4115, up 1.45cents.   Analysts said buying was prompted in part by the London MetalExchange's report of a 9,200-metric-ton drop in its warehousesupplies of copper last week. The market had expected a decline of5,000 to 7,000 metric tons.   Meanwhile, a miner's strike in Peru ended its second week onMonday, increasing concerns that supply problems could persist intonext year.   ``The Peruvian situation is getting more critical every day,''said William O'Neill, director of research with Elders Futures Inc.in New York.   Meanwhile user demand for copper in the United States remained``very strong,'' dispelling any fears that last week's pricedecline signified a new trend in the market.   ``We're seeing both supply and demand developments that arebullish for the market,'' O'Neill said. ``We had a nice littletechnical consolidation last week and now it's roaring back on avery constructive set of fundamentals.''
