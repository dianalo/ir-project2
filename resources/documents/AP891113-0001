At least 305 people have been killed and 378 wounded since therebels attacked Saturday night, according to the armed forcesmortuary, civilian morgues and hospitals and unofficial militaryfigures. It is the biggest guerrilla offensive since 1981.   Thousands of civilians were trapped in their homes by exchangesof gunfire between the army and guerrillas of the leftist FarabundoMarti National Liberation Front (FMLN). Helicopter gunships andmilitary planes flew over the city to attack rebel positions.   Few of the city's 1 million people were on the streets andnearly all downtown stores were closed.   Rebels were holding ground in an arc of heavily populatednorthern districts.   Military planes fired rockets Monday afternoon into the easternneighborhoods of Venecia and Conacaste, trying to drive outguerrillas. Some rockets struck homes, killing several civiliansand wounding others.   A broadcast on the rebels' clandestine Radio Venceremos Mondaynight said, ``Every attempt by the army to recover these positionshas turned into a profound bloodbath among their troops and elitecorps. They have lost whole companies, producing a bigdemoralization in enemy ranks.''   Col. Rene Ponce, the army chief of staff, addressed the nationon television and denied the rebels controlled any part of thecapital.   ``There is no zone under FMLN control,'' he said. ``We arefighting in some sectors on the edge of the capital.''   He also said he ``roundly and categorically rejects theaccusations'' that military aircraft have bombed the capital. ``Thearmed forces have not carried out any bombings in San Salvador,''he said.   Ricardo Alexander Perdomo, 12, said in a hospital: ``A bomb hitthe house and killed my mother and my little sister. A planedropped the bomb.'' He said guerrillas gave him first aid.   U.S. Embassy sources said about 1,500 rebels were fighting inthe city. Heavy combat also was reported in Santa Ana, a westernprovince, in San Miguel to the east, around the central city ofZacatecoluca and outside Usulutan, a major city in eastern ElSalvador.   The army press office stopped providing casualty counts or otherinformation and telephone calls to provincial cities did not gothrough.   Officials at the armed forces mortuary said it had the bodies of67 soldiers and military sources said 127 guerrillas had beenkilled. Morgues reported the bodies of 51 civilians.   Hospitals said 258 civilians had been wounded. On Sunday, thearmed forces reported 65 soldiers and 55 guerrillas wounded.   The U.S. Embassy said 86 soldiers, 202 guerrillas and 17civilians had been killed, a total of 305. Its count of 373 woundedincluded 189 soldiers, 96 rebels and 88 civilians, the embassysaid, and 43 guerrillas were captured.   Rosales Hospital, a government institution, was without water,blood plasma, anaesthetics and other supplies, said Dr. Fausto CeaGil, the director. Stretchers lined hallways outside emergencyrooms.   President Alfredo Cristiani announced a state of siege and a 6p.m.-6 a.m. curfew Sunday and legislators were considering morerestrictions on civil rights.   The Bush administration said Cristiani's government had notrequested U.S. assistance in repelling the rebel attack.   ``It's our belief that they are in control of the situation atthis point,'' said White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.Asked whether he would rule out U.S. involvement in the fighting,he said: ``At this point it's not anticipated.''   Fifty-five U.S. military trainers are stationed in El Salvadorbut are not supposed to participate in military missions. Fitzwatersaid their status was unchanged.   The rebels began their offensive, attacking 35 to 40 militaryposts in the city and others in the provinces, after pulling out ofpeace talks to protest attacks on leftist political and unionleaders. They blame the military and the Cristiani government forthe attacks.   Cristiani, who took office June 1, leads the rightistNationalist Republican Alliance, known as Arena. His party has beenlinked to death squads that operated with near-impunity early inthe war and are blamed for most of the 70,000 deaths.   Heavy fighting continued in densely populated neighborhoods onthe northern and eastern edges of San Salvador.   ``We came down from the mountains and we're going to stayhere,'' said a guerrilla who identified himself only as Porfirio.``We're winning so far and we have their morale down.''   Porfirio gestured with his AK-47 assault rifle toward soldiersin the distance who seemed to be preparing for an attack.   Beatriz, an 18-year-old guerrilla with an M-16 rifle, said inSoyapango, an eastern suburb: ``The order is that, instead ofretreating, we have to advance inside.''   Army troopers took up positions about 300 yards away. Eightbodies, apparently guerrillas, lay nearby.   Rebel snipers controlled the tallest buildings in Metropolis andZacamil, said a woman who fled the area.   In Soyapango, a woman approached reporters and asked for help.   ``We have no water, no food,'' she said. ``We have been heresince Saturday and the children haven't eaten anything. Help us!''   Many people knew little of what was going on around them. Afterfighting began, the government ordered radio stations into anational network and took news programs off the air.   Television stations broadcast their usual programs, but were notallowed to transmit news.   Under the state of siege declared by Cristiani, free speech,freedom of movement and the right to assemble are suspended.   Civilians killed in the guerrilla offensive include an Americanteacher in San Salvador, the State Department said. Kay Babcock ofSpokane, Wash., said the victim was her 25-year-old son,Christopher.</TEXT></DOC>
