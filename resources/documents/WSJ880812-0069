Most of those loans have payments based directly on the prime rate and are adjusted frequently, often monthly. Thus, the mid-July round of half-point prime rate increases -- and yesterday's encore to 10% from 9.5% -- each added about $250 million a year to home equity borrowers' collective interest bill.    The figures are based on a survey of a representative 580 of the nation's 13,613 banks in a study, &quot;Home Equity Credit Report 1988,&quot; distributed to American Bankers Association members last month. Atlanta banker William Kirkpatrick, who chaired the ABA committee that produced the study, said that while the committee didn't get access to savings and loan associations' home equity data, commercial banks are thought to account for about 75% of this lending market.    For the banks, the increased home equity loan payments will be icing on a very profitable cake. According to the ABA study, the default rates on these loans at year-end 1987 were just 0.67%, or about a third the rate for their nearest cousins, second mortgage loans.    The study shows that almost 98% of banks' home equity loans, which actually are credit lines secured by the borrower's equity in his or her home, carry variable rather than fixed interest rates. And some 88% of these variable rate loans are adjusted based on the prime rate. The loan rate typically floats 1.5 to 2 percentage points above the prime rate.    The study also shows that at the end of last year, banks held a total of $30.37 billion of home equity loans to nearly 900,000 customers in their portfolios and they expected to add $25 billion in new loans in 1988.    Based on Mr. Kirkpatrick's estimate that this represents 75% of the market, total home equity loans outstanding at year-end 1987 amounted to more than $40 billion and at the end of this year will total more than $80 billion. On the same basis, the number of home equity borrowers, an estimated 1.2 million at year-end 1987, will rise to almost 1.9 million.    The particular feature that has been driving the home equity loan boom is that, for most borrowers, the interest costs are deductible for federal income tax purposes.    Yesterday, Mr. Kirkpatrick minimized the direct impact on home equity borrowers' wallets of the latest round of prime rate increases. He noted that a significant number of these loans have monthly payments that are limited to 2% of the loan balance each month, with some of the payment allotted to pay interest and some to amortize the loan principal.    &quot;For people with this type of loan, the prime rate move won't cause any increase in their payment,&quot; said Mr. Kirkpatrick, who is a vice president at Atlanta-based Citizens andamp; Southern National Bank. &quot;It'll just mean that a larger portion of the payment will apply to pay interest and a smaller portion to retire the principal.&quot;    But interest alone is charged on more than half the outstanding home equity loans: No principal amortization is required for a prolonged period, such as five years. The prime rate increase will raise next month's payments of these loans.    While the trend to adjustable rates served to protect lenders from the effects of the hyperinflation of the late 1970s and early 1980s (and so doubtless forestalled a major credit crunch at that time), it also will mean more pain for borrowers in any future interest-rate spiral. And many observers suspect such a spiral has begun. </TEXT></DOC>
