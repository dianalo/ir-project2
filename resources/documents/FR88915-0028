The Agency is proposingtesting for MEKO under section 4(a)(1)(A) and (B) of TSCA.Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimatedto average 535 hours per response, including time for reviewing instructions,searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed,and completing and reviewing the collection of information.

Introduction</ITAG>A. ITC RecommendationTSCA (Pub. L. 94-469, 90 Stat. 2003 <T3>et seq.</T3>, 15 U.S.C. 2601 <T3>et seq.</T3>) established the ITC under section 4(e) to recommend toEPA a list of chemical substances and mixtures (chemicals) to be consideredfor testing under TSCA section 4(a).The ITC added MEKO to the ITC's list of chemicals for priority considerationby EPA in the promulgation of test rules under section 4(a) of TSCA. TheITC recommended MEKO be considered for health effects testing in its 19thReport, published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of November 14, 1986 (51 FR 41417), especiallyfor its effects on the hematopoietic system and for its oncogenic potential.The ITC did not designate a time period for EPA's response on MEKO.The ITC's rationale for health effects testing was based on concern forwidespread use of MEKO and the potential for human exposure; the lack ofa no-effect level for blood effects demonstrated in animal studies of MEKO;and the absence of data on MEKO's oncogenic potential.B. General Pharmacokinetics Test GuidelineIn the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of September 27, 1985 (50 FR 39252), EPA issued40 CFR Parts 796, 797 and 798, which codified TSCA test guidelines thatwere previously prepared by EPA. At that time, EPA stated that new guidelineswould be added as the state of the art of testing evolves and as the needfor new guidelines arises. This document proposes a new test guidelinefor pharmacokinetics that may be used to establish test standards in futureTSCA Section 4 test rules in 40 CFR Part 799. The test guidelines are stateof the art methods for generating test data and, when cited in chemicalspecific rules, would assist EPA in reaching decisions regarding the riskof a particular chemical. This pharmacokinetics test guideline has beenextensively reviewed by both internal and external experts.Codification of this guideline, however, would not impose any regulatoryobligation on any person who may be subject to a TSCA Section 4 test rulebecause the guidelines do not become mandatory test standards until theyare promulgated as such in an individual test rule for a specific chemicalsubstance or mixture. EPA may modify the pharmacokinetics test guidelineas it appears to a proposed rule for a specific test substance. Each specificrule employing the test guideline would be subject to public comment.EPA is also proposing that this test guideline would serve as the teststandard for the MEKO pharmacokinetics testing.C. Opportunity for Negotiating a Consent OrderEPA raised the possibility of conducting testing on MEKO through an enforceableconsent agreement. Industry representatives present at the public meetingfor MEKO on December 17, 1986, indicated that a consent agreement wouldnot be practicable because agreement between importers and the sole UnitedStates manufacturer was not likely (Ref. 24). Industry reaffirmed thata consent order would not be feasible at the public meeting to announceEPA's course-setting decision held December 15, 1987 (Ref. 25).D. Test Rule Development Under TSCAUnder section 4(a) of TSCA, EPA must require testing of a chemical to develophealth or environmental data if the Administrator makes certain findingsas described in TSCA under section 4(a)(1)(A) or (B). Detailed discussionsof the statutory section 4 findings are provided in EPA's first and secondproposed test rules which were published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of July 18, 1980 (45 FR 48510) and June 5, 1981(46 FR 30300).In evaluating the ITC's testing recommendations for MEKO, EPA consideredall available relevant information including the following: informationpresented in the ITC's report and public comments on the ITC's recommendations;production volume, use, exposure, and release information reported by manufacturersand importers of MEKO under the TSCA section 8(a) Preliminary AssessmentInformation Rule (40 CFR Part 712); health and safety studies submittedunder the TSCA section 8(d) Health and Safety Data Reporting Rule (40 CFRPart 716) concerning MEKO; and published and unpublished data availableto the Agency. From its evaluation, as described in this proposed rule,EPA is proposing health effects testing for MEKO under TSCA section 4(a)(1)(A)and (B), and, as such, EPA is responding to the ITC's recommendation ofMEKO for testing consideration.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Review of Available Data</ITAG>A. ProfileMEKO, also known as 2-butanone oxime, (CAS Registry Number 96-29-7), isa clear, colorless to light yellow liquid at room temperature, with a barelydiscernible ethereal aroma. The molecular weight of MEKO is 87.12 daltons.The solubility of MEKO in water is 100 g/L. MEKO has a vapor pressure of1.06 mm Hg 20anddegrees;C. The flash point is 69anddegrees;C and the boilingpoint is 152anddegrees;C. Given these properties, MEKO is expected to volatilize;and, therefore, workers may be exposed through inhalation during manufacturing,processing, and use.B. ProductionMEKO is produced by reacting methyl ethyl ketone with hydroxylamine. Itis produced in the United States by Allied-Signal, Inc. (Allied), Hopewell,VA. Current total production volume information on MEKO is claimed confidentialbusiness information (CBI). However, in its 19th report the ITC reportedthat 2.2 million pounds of MEKO were imported into the United States in1985 and 2.0 to 2.9 million points were produced in the United States in1983. From this information and information on the volume of MEKO whichis claimed CBI, EPA believes that the combined annual production and importvolume of MEKO in the United States exceeds 5 million pounds. At the presenttime, there are five importers of MEKO: (1) Aceto Corp., Flushing, NY;(2) Interstab Chemical, New Brunswick, NJ; (3) Mooney Chemicals, Inc.,Cleveland, OH; (4) Nuodex, Inc., Elizabeth, NJ; and (5) Troy Chemical Corp.,Newark, NJ (Ref. 2).C. UsesMEKO is sold primarily as a nonreactive antiskinning agent in alkyd surfacecoatings and paints. The concentration of MEKO in paints and coatings rangesfrom 0.1 percent to 0.8 percent. MEKO is also used as a blocking agentfor isocyanates and siloxames. MEKO may also be used in other industrialproducts. The National Occupational Hazard Survey Tradename IngredientDatabase (Ref. 11) lists 26 industrial products that contain MEKO. Themajority of these products are paints, but MEKO is also found in exteriorcaulk, paste fillers, pentane gel, and antiskinning products.In addition to being found in industrial products, MEKO may also be addedto consumer products. The Consumer Product Safety Commission's Chemicalsin Products Database listed 764 products which contained MEKO at concentrationsranging from 0.1 to 0.8 percent. Most of the products from this list weresurface coatings or paints but also included were 12 bathroom bowl cleaners,a glass cleaner, a liquid rug shampoo, an aluminum cleaner, a developer,an adhesive, a household cleaner, and a caulking and repair product (Ref.10). In addition to the above uses, EPA has been informed of another usewhich has been claimed CBI.D. Human Exposure1. <T3>Occupational.</T3> During its manufacture, 100 workers are potentiallyexposed to MEKO via inhalation or dermal contact. Fifteen of the 100 maybe exposed to MEKO on a daily basis up to 300 days per year (Ref. 13).Using monitoring data for 8-hour time weighted average exposure levelssubmitted by Allied, EPA estimates workers may be exposed to up to 43 mgof MEKO per day. Using models for filling operations, EPA estimates inhalationexposures may reach 90 to 100 ppm for 2-hour periods for drumming and tanktruck loading and up to 2 ppm for sampling and quality control. Furthermore,there may be dermal exposure. EPA estimates that, during drumming, tankcar loading, filter changes, and maintenance and cleanup, dermal exposuremay range from 1,300 to 3,900 mg/day. During sampling and quality control(QC) analysis, dermal exposure may range from 650 to 1,950 mg/day (Ref.13).The National Occupational Hazard Survey (NOHS; Refs. 11 and 13) reportsthat 12,100 workers in 1,540 plants were potentially exposed to MEKO inthe workplace. Half of these workers were mixing and batching operators.Preliminary data from the National Occupational Exposure Survey (NOES;Refs. 12 and 13) indicate that 2,145 workers in 19 plants were potentiallyexposed to MEKO in 1980.During the processing of MEKO, inhalation and dermal exposure may occurwhen mixers or reactors are charged or unloaded. Exposure levels for theseoperations may range from 1 to 2 mg/day for inhalation exposure to 3,900mg/day for dermal exposure (Ref. 13). Exposure to MEKO from drumming ortank car filling with final products is estimated to be less than 1 mg/dayfor inhalation exposure and 13 to 39 mg/day for dermal exposure (Ref. 13).An estimated 900,000 or more commercial painters in the United States maybe routinely exposed to MEKO (Ref. 16). During use, EPA estimates thatcommercial painters may be exposed to as much as 432 mg/day (328 mg viainhalation and 104 mg via dermal routes; Ref. 3).<T3>2. Consumer. </T3>Consumers are exposed to MEKO from the use of paintsand other products containing MEKO. A National Household Survey of InteriorPaints (Ref. 4), indicates that one in five households in the United Stateshad a member who conducted some painting during the year. Of these, 16.8percent use oil-based paints. The maximum use of oil-based paints by consumerswas found to be 12 gallons per year, and maximum painting time was 72 hoursper year. Painting consisted of covering walls and ceilings as well astrim and other woodwork. Based on this survey and model estimates of exposurelevels, over 2 million consumers may potentially be exposed to up to approximately432 mg/day of MEKO for up to 3 days per year (Refs. 3 and 4).E. Health Effects<T3>1. Pharmacokinetics. </T3>The only data on the absorption and distributionof MEKO are provided by a summary of an autoradiography study submittedby Allied (Ref. 5). Pregnant mice were administered as single oral doseof 14C- labeled MEKO on day 14 of gestation. In addition, one male mousewas administered a single oral dose of MEKO. The distribution of the 14Clabel was noted over a 24-hour period. Based on this limited data, it appearsthat MEKO is rapidly absorbed via the oral route, and distributed intactthroughout the body. The study showed that the 14C label was found to occurat higher levels in the liver of the developing fetus than in the mother,and complete clearance of the 14C label occurred in approximately 16 hours.There is insufficient information to determine the relative rates of absorption,distribution, metabolism, and excretion of MEKO. Allied speculated thatMEKO would metabolize to methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) and hydroxylamine butsupplied no information to support this contention (Ref. 30). <T3>2. Acute toxicity. </T3>The ITC report classified MEKO as a mildlytoxic agent, citing the results of acute oral, dermal, and inhalation exposurestudies by Allied (Ref. 30). EPA has received additional information submittedby various companies under section 8(d) of TSCA confirming these results(Refs. 31 through 37). In a summary of acute oral studies on rats and mice,Allied reported the LD50s to be 1,000 mg/kg in mice and to range from 930to 3,700 mg/kg in the rat (Refs. 27 and 30). Other companies reported LD50'sof 1,600 to 2,760 mg/kg in rats (Refs. 32, 35, and 36). In a dermal toxicitystudy reported by Allied, the LD100 in rabbits was found to be 2.0 mL/kg(1,860 mg/kg) (Ref. 30). Central nervous system depression was observedprior to death. In addition, Allied reported methemoglobin formation at0.2 mL/kg, but there were no observed effects on the blood at 0.02 mL/kg(19 mg/kg) administered daily for 5 weeks (Refs. 14 and 30).Rats exposed to airborne concentrations of 190, 1,450, and 4,830 mg/m3(53, 407, and 1,355 ppm) for 4 hours showed anesthesia in the high doesgroup and methemoglobinemia in the mid and high dose groups (Refs. 14 and30). No deaths occurred. In another short terms test, rats were exposedfor 24 hours per day for 5 days to a saturated vapor of MEKO (calculatedto be 8,000 mg/m3; Refs. 14 and 30). Death occurred in 4 to 5 days.Allied reported MEKO to be a skin irritant and sensitizer (Ref. 30). MEKOwas found to produce equivocal results on sensitization in the Buehlertest and positive sensitization results when tested in the Morganson-Kligmanmaximization test in guinea pigs (Ref. 30). From a moust ear swelling test,Gad et al. reported the MEKO caused 40 percent of the animals to be sensitized(Ref. 38). While Allied reported only slight skin irritation from the applicationof MEKO to rabbits, Kodak reported scarring of skin and severe erythemafrom dermal application to rats (Ref. 34). Most reports indicated thatMEKO is a severe eye irritant.<T3>3. Subchronic toxicity.</T3> The longest duration study conducted todate with MEKO is a 13-week oral toxicity study conducted in 1977 by HazletonLaboratories for Allied (Ref. 30). Rats received MEKO by gavage at doesof 25, 75, or 225 mg/kg, 5 days per week. Treated groups from both sexesshowed dose related decreases in erythrocyte count, and hematocrit andhemoglobin values and displayed a moderate to marked reticulocytosis. Heinzbodies, occasional siderocytes, polychromasia, basophilic stippling, andHowell-Jolly bodies were generally present in the mid and high dose groups.Blood chemistries revealed an elevation of total bilirubin and erythrocytecholinesterase in mid dose males and high dose males and females. Alkalinephosphatase levels of high dose males also increased. A slight depressionin blood urea nitrogen and plasma cholinesterase levels were noted in thehigh dose level female group. There was also an increase in the absoluteand/or relative weights of the spleen, liver, and kidney in all dose groups.The spleen and liver were dark and histologic examination of these organsrevealed hematopoiesis (extramedullary) and macrophages with greenish-brownpigment. Pigment of similar appearance was also detected in the epithelialcells lining the proximal convoluted tubules of the kidney.These data suggest that MEKO induces a hemolytic anemia in the rat withcompensatory erythropoiesis. This study did not define a no-observed-adverse-effectlevel (NOAEL), but predicted the NOAEL to be less than 25 mg/kg/day. Inaddition to the effects on the hematopoietic system, data from the 13-weekstudy show that the number of animals with decreased spermatogenesis oraspermatogenesis was markedly increased in the high dose group (225 mg/kg).Many effects similar to those found in the Allied study were observed byJurita (1967) in a 4-week study in which MEKO was administered by subcutaneousinjuction (Refs. 14 and 30).<T3>4. Developmental effects and reproductive toxicity.</T3> The reportedresults of the 13-week study discussed in Unit II.E.3. suggest the MEKOmay adversely affect spermatogenesis and, thus, reproduction. Since MEKOmay metabolize to hydroxylamine and methyl ethyl ketone (MEK; Ref. 30),the results of tests on these possible metabolites suggest that MEKO mayalso cause developmental and reproductive toxicity. In a study by Chaubeand Murphy, an increase in resorptions occurred in pregnant rats givena single intraperitoneal injection of hydroxylamine hydrochloride and adose of 47 mg/kg (Refs. 39 and 47). In addition, Zimmermann and Gottschewiskireported teratogenic effects from the injection of 10 mg/kg of hydroxylamineinto pregnant rabbits (Refs. 40 and 47); De Sesso found malformations inthe offspring of rabbits exposed to hydroxylamine through interacoelomicinjections (Refs. 41 and 47); and Stoll et al. demonstrated developmentaleffects from injection of hydroxylamine directly into chicken embryos (Refs.42 and 43). Furthermore, in a study by Ramaiya, exposure to hydroxylamineappears to produce a decrease in fertility in male mice by adversely affectingspecific stages of spermatogenesis (Refs. 44, 45, and 46). It also resultsin maldevelopment of the mannary glands, alterations in circulating prolactinglevels, alterations in length of estrus cycle, and failure of Graafianfollicles to develop into corpora lutea after ovulation (Refs. 44, 45,and 46). MEK, another possible metabolite of MEKO (Ref. 28), caused fetal abnormalitiesin rats at 1,000 ppm and soft tissue abnormalities in rats at 3,000 ppm(Refs. 15 and 52). These data are insufficient to fully characterize MEKO'sdevelopmental and reproductive effects, but suggest that MEKO may causesuch effects. Developmental toxicity and reproductive effects studies havenot been conducted on MEKO itself. EPA believes that the above data onhydroxylamine and MEK and the subchronic toxicity data on MEKO, providesuggestive evidence that MEKO may cause reproductive effects and developmentaltoxicity.<T3>5. Mutagenicity. </T3>Concern for the potential mutagenicity of MEKOis based on mutagenicity data on MEK and hydroxylamine. The National CancerInstitute (NCI) reported that MEKO was mutagenic in the mouse lymphomagene mutation assay (Ref. 48). MEKO was nonmutagenic in <T3>Salmonella </T3>strain TA98, TA100, TA1535, TA1537, and TA198 (Refs.30 and 53). These data are insufficient to fully characterize MEKO's mutagenicitypotential, but suggest that MEKO may be mutagenic.EPA, in a review of the mutagenicity data on hydroxylamine and hydroxylaminehydrochloride, found the chemicals to be gene mutagens, clastogens, inducersof sister chromatid exchange and DNA effects, and/or inducers of cell transformation.Effects were observed in plant cells, prokaryotes, lower and higher eukaryotes,and mammals and mammalian cells, including mammalian germ cells (Refs.46 and 47). Because hydroxylamine and hydroxylamine hydrochloride are mutagenic,MEKO may also be mutagenic. <T3>6. Oncogenicity. </T3>Concern for the potential oncogenicity of MEKOis based on data on acetoxime (Refs. 6, 9, 28, and 29), a close structuralanalogue of MEKO, and on the positive mouse lymphoma gene mutation assayusing MEKO (Ref. 48).Acetoxime was tested in an 18-month carcinogenicity study conducted byMiryish et al. (Ref. 28) using MRC-Wistar rats. The oncogenic effects notedin this study raise significant concern about the potential carcinogenicityof MEKO, a close structural analogue of acetoxime, which differs from MEKOby the addition of a single methyl group. While EPA is acutely aware ofdeficiencies on the data that would prevent its use in quantitative riskassessment, the study is nevertheless sufficient to raise concern for thepossible oncogenicity of MEKO by analogy to acetoxime (Refs. 6, 9, and28).Acetoxime administered in the drinking water to rats induced a statisticallysignificant increase in the incidence of hepatocellular adenomas in 80percent of male rates (Ref. 28). The incidence of liver tumors in femaleswas not significant. No liver tumors were noted in the untreated controls;these results are similar to those for previous untreated groups (historicalcontrol; Ref. 28).Following the publication of the Mirvish study, EPA was informed by theauthor that a second pathologist reviewed the original histopathologicalslides.Secondary analysis confirmed the diagnosis of hepatocellular adenomas in11 of 12 animals.Hepatocellular carcinomas were also noted in 6 of the 11 animals that hadadenomas (Refs. 6 and 29).The positive mouse lymphoma gene mutation assay on MEKO provides furthersuggestive evidence that MEKO may be oncogenic because the correlationfrom the mouse lymphoma gene mutation assay in the L5178Y system to oncogenicityas determined in phase II of the EPA Gene-Tox Program is 81.5 percent (Ref.54). EPA believes there is sufficient evidence to indicate that the Chinesehamster V79 system, mouse lymphoma gene mutation L5178Y system, and theChinese hamster ovary system assays may be used to trigger an in vivo assayfor oncogenicity (50 FR 20672; May 17, 1985).<T3>7. Neurotoxicity. </T3>No studies were found in the literature or submittedby industry on the neurological or neurobehavioral toxicity of MEKO.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Findings</ITAG>EPA is basing its proposed pharmacokinetics, oncogenicity, mutagenicity,developmental toxicity, reproductive toxicity, and neurotoxicity testingfor MEKO on the authority of section 4(a)(1) (A) and (B) of TSCA.Under section section 4(a)(1)(B)(i) EPA finds the MEKO is produced in substantialquantities and that there may be substantial human exposure during manufacturing,processing, and use of MEKO.The total annual production of MEKO in CBI; however, according to publiclyavailable information, total imports and domestic annual production arein excess of 5 million pounds per year (Ref. 2). An estimated 2 millionconsumers may be exposed to MEKO through use of oil-based paints and additionallymay be exposed to MEKO through use of household cleaning products and adhesive,caulking, and repair products (Refs. 3, 4, and 10). An estimated 900,000professional painters may be routinely exposed to MEKO through use of oil-basedpaints (Ref. 16). An estimated 12,000 workers in 1,500 plants may be exposedthrough manufacture and processing of MEKO (Refs. 11 and 30).Under section 4(a)(1)(A)(i), EPA finds that the manufacture, processing,and use of MEKO may present and unreasonable risk of injury to human healthdue to its potential to cause oncogenic, mutagenic, reproductive, developmental,and blood effects for the reasons presented in Unit II.E. and in the supportdocument (Ref. 1) which is available in the rulemaking record. Exposureto MEKO is described above. The finding for potential oncogenic risk isbased upon date which indicates that acetoxime, a close structural analogueof MEKO, caused benign and malignant hepatocellular tumors in mice (Refs.6, 9, 28, and 29). In addition, MEKO is positive in the mouse lymphomagene mutation assay (Ref. 48). Data in these reports suggest that MEKOmay be oncogenic.  The finding for potential mutagenic risk is based on open data indicatingthat MEKO caused gene mutations in a mouse lymphoma gene mutation test(Ref. 48). In addition, hydroxylamine, a possible metabolite of MEKO, ismutagenic in various systems (Refs. 46 and 47). Data in these reports supporta concern for potential mutagenic risk from MEKO.  The finding for potential reproductive risk is based on adverse effectson testes of rats from a 90-day exposure to MEKO (Ref. 30). In addition,hydroxylamine, a possible metabolite of MEKO, appears to adversely affectspermatogenesis, mammary gland development, prolactin levels, estrus cycle,and development of graafian follicles (Refs. 6, 15, 43, 45, and 46). Theseresults suggest potential reproductive risk from MEKO.  The finding for potential developmental risk is based on data from testson methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), a possible metabolite of MEKO, which indicatethat MEK causes fetal skeletal abnormalities in rats at 1,000 ppm and softtissue abnormalities in rats at 3,000 ppm (Ref. 15). In addition, dataon hydroxylamine (Refs. 40, 41, 42, 43, and 47), another possible metaboliteof MEKO, suggest that hydroxylamine is developmentally toxic, raising concernthat MEKO may also potentially cause developmental effects.  The finding for potential blood effects risk is based on data from a 90-dayoral toxicity study of MEKO (Ref. 30) which suggest that MEKO induces ahemolytic anemia in the rat with compensatory erythropoiesis as describedin section II.E.3., and supports concern for the risk of blood effectsfrom MEKO. Although the available data on blood effects are adequate for risk assessment,it may be in the interest of those subject to this rule to further assessblood effects. The 90-day subchronic study (Ref. 30) does not provide aNOAEL for blood effects for MEKO. Uncertainty factors would be added tothe LOAEL to establish acceptable levels of exposure. Testing to determinethe NOAEL for blood effects associated with subchronic and chronic exposurewould reduce the uncertainty in evaluating MEKO.  The NOAEL for blood effects could be established in the subchronic rangefinding studies for the MEKO oncogenicity test. This data should be developedaccording to the test guideline at 40 CFR 798.2650 modified to direct specificattention towards the hematology profile. Hematology determinations (hematocrit,hemoglobin concentrations, erythrocyte count, total and differential leukocytecount, and a measure of clotting potential such as clotting time, prothrombintime, thromboplastin time, or platelet count) and certain clinical biochemistrydeterminations on blood could be made on all groups including controlsat day 30 and at day 90 of the test period for the rat. Since this assuresdata on the concurrent controls, baseline data prior to the initiationof exposure would not be needed. A chronic NOAEL for blood effects couldbe obtained by modifying the oncogenicity study to include hematology andblood biochemistry. This could be accomplished by modifying the oncogenicitytest guideline at 40 CFR 798.3300 to include hematology determinationsand certain clinical biochemistry determinations on blood for rats, aslisted in 40 CFR 798.3320, the combined chronic toxicity/oncogenicity testguideline. Alternatively, the test sponsor could conduct the combined chronictoxicity/oncogenicity test at 40 CFR 798.3320. Provisions from 40 CFR 798.3320would be modified to be consistent with the revisions of 40 CFR 798.3300(52 FR 19055; May 20, 1987). Satellite groups of rats may be necessaryto avoid stress to the test animals from blood sampling and to providesufficient animals for adequate blood collections.  The findings for the above potential health effects under section 4(a)(1)(A)(i),and the finding that MEKO is produced in substantial quantities and thatthere may be substantial human exposure under section 4(a)(1)(B)(i), supportEPA's concern that the manufacturing, processing, and use of MEKO may presentan unreasonable risk of injury to human health.  Under section 4(a)(1) (A)(ii) and (B) (ii), EPA finds that there are insufficientdata and experience from which the potential health risks (other than bloodeffects) from manufacturing, processing, and use of MEKO can reasonablybe determined or predicted. In the 90-day subchronic test of MEKO the lowest-observed-adverse-effectlevel (LOAEL) was determined to be 25 mg/kg. The LOAEL data from the subchronictest is adequate for risk assessment. However, if manufacturers of MEKOdesire to reduce the uncertainty factors that would be used in risk assessment,additional testing to determine a NOAEL is recommended but not required.Under section 4(a)(1) (A)(iii) and (B)(iii), EPA finds that testing ofMEKO is necessary to develop such data for oncogenicity, mutagenicity,reproductive toxicity, developmental toxicity, neurotoxicity, and pharmacokinetics.EPA believes that data resulting from this testing will be relevant toa determination as to whether manufacturing, processing and use of MEKOdoes or does not present an unreasonable risk of injury to human health. Because of the above concerns for oncogenicity, mutagenicity, blood effects,reproductive effects, and developmental toxicity for the described exposuresto MEKO, EPA finds that pharmacokinetics test data are necessary. Ultimatelythe purpose for generating pharmacokinetics data is to use the informationin risk assessement. Such applications offer the only scientific avenuefor making extrapolations of toxicologic data from species to species,from route to route of administration, and from high to low does. Furthermore,does selections for the chronic toxicity studies would be imporved by priorknowledge of the extent of absorption by the routes to be used. In addition,these data would be used to detect major differences between sexes relativeto the metabolic processes of absorption, tissue distribution, biotans-formationand excretion, whether the metabolic processes are modified by differentroutes of administration of the test substance, and whether these procesesare modified by repeated dosing. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Proposed Rule </ITAG>A. Proposed Testing and Test Standards On the basis of the information presented in Unit II, and the findingsset forth in Unit III, EPA is proposing health effects testing for MEKO.The tests would be conducted in accordance with EPA's TSCA Good LaboratoryPractice Standards in 40 CFR Part 792 and specific TSCA test guidelinesin 40 CFR Parts 795 and 798, or other published test methods as specifiedin this test rule for MEKO in the following table. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,i1,s25,xs42,7,8 </C><T4>Table._Proposed Testing, Test Standards and Reporting Requirementsfor MEKO</T4><H1>Test </H1><H1>Test standard (40 CFR citation)</H1><H1>Reporting deadline for final report\1\</H1><H1>Number of interim (6 month) reports required</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Pharmacokinetics <D>\2\andSection; 798.7485</D><D>15 </D><D>2</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Oncogenicity <D>andSection; 798.3300</D><D>53 </D><D>8</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Developmental toxicity <D>andSection; 798.4900</D><D>15 </D><D>2 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Reproductive toxicity <D>andSection; 798.4700 </D><D>24 </D><D>3</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Sex-linked recessive lethal assay in <T3>Drosophiala </T3><D>andSection; 798.5275 </D><D>18 </D><D>2 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"><T3>In vivo </T3>mammalian cyto-genetics assay: Chromosomal analysis ormicronucleus assay <D>andSection; 798.5385</D><P/>or<P>andSection; 798.5395 </P><D>8 </D><D>0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Functional observation battery, acute and subchronic <D>andSection; 798.6050 </D><D>12</D><D>1</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Motor activity test, acute and subchronic <D>andSection; 798.6200 </D><D>12 </D><D>1</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Neuropathology, subchronic <D>andSection; 798.6400 </D><D>12 </D><D>1</D><F>\1\ Number of months after effective date of the final rule unless specifiedotherwise.</F><F>\2\ Proposed in this notice.</F></ITAG></ITAG> The health effects tests proposed to be conducted for MEKO are: (1) Pharmacokineticsusing the guideline proposed in this document as 40 CFR 798.7485 includingoral, dermal, inhalation, and intravenous absorptions, repeated dosing,and washing efficiency studies; (2) an oral 2-year oncogenicity study,using the guideline at 40 CFR 798.3300; (3) an oral 2-species developmentaltoxicity study using the guideline at 40 CFR 798.4900; (4) an oral 2-generationreproductive toxicity study using the guideline at 40 CFR 798.4700 andincluding histopathology of the testes with staging of the sperm, histopathologyof the ovaries, and vaginal cytology for the last 3 weeks prior to matingto monitor the estrus cycle; (5) sex-linked recessive lethal gene mutationassay in <T3>Drosophial </T3>using the guideline at 40 CFR 798.5275; (6) <T3>in vivo </T3>mammalian bone marrow cytogenetics test using the guidelinefor either the chromosomal analysis at 40 CFR 798.5385 or the micronucleusassay at 40 CFR 798.5395; and (7) acute and subchronic 90-day oral neurotoxicitytests including a functional observation battery using the guideline at40 CFR 798.6050, a motor activity test using the guideline at 40 CFR 798.6200,and neuropathology test using the guideline at 40 CFR 798.6400. If thethree tests listed under (7) above combined, at least 10 animals per sexper dose level would be used.The test guideline would be modified in the 2-generation reproductive toxicitytest. The integrity of the various cell stages of spermatogenesis wouldbe determined with particular attention directed toward achieving optimalquality in fixation and embedding. Preparations of testicular and associatedreproductive organ samples for histology would follow the recommendationsof Lamb and Chapin (Ref. 17), or an equivalent procedure, and histopathologyof the testes would be done on P<T2>0</T2> and F<T2>1</T2> adult males at the time of sacrifice. Histological analyseswould include evaluations of the spermatogenic cycle, i.e., the presenceand integrity of the 14 cell stages. These evaluations would follow theguidance provided by Clermont and Perey (Ref. 18). Information should alsobe provided regarding the nature and level of lesions observed in controlanimals for comparative purposes. Data on female cyclicity in P<T2>0</T2> and F<T2>1</T2> females over the last 3 weeks prior to mating. The method ofSadleir (Ref. 19), or an equivalent method, would be used. Additional guidancemay be obtained from Hafez (Ref. 23). Data would be provided on whetherthe animal is cycling and the cycle length. P<T2>0</T2> and F<T2>1</T2> females would continue to be exposed to MEKO in order to permitthem to begin cycling once again. The ovary would be serially sectionedwith a sufficient number of sections examined to adequately detail oocyteand follicular morphology. The methods of Mattison and Thorgiersson (Ref.20) and Pederson and Peters (Ref. 21) may provide guidance. The strategyfor sectioning and evaluation would be left to the discretion of the investigator,but would be described in detail in the protocol and final report. Thenature and background level of lesions in the control tissue would alsobe noted. Gross and histologic evaluation of mammary glands would be conductedon female F<T2>1</T2> and F<T2>2</T2> pups sacrificed at weaning and in adult F<T2>1</T2> females at the termination of the study.An <T3>in vitro</T3> mammalian cytogenetics assay, a gene mutation assay in<T3>Salmonella</T3>, and a sister chromatid exchange test on MEKO are beingconducted by the National Toxicology Program. EPA will evaluate the datafrom these tests, the sex-linked recessive lethal assay in <T3>Drosophila</T3>, the <T3>in vivo</T3> mammalian cytogenetics assay, and other information developedon MEKO to determine if the mouse visible specific locus assay, the rodentdominant lethal assay, the rodent heritable translocation assay, or othermutagenic testing is necessary for MEKO. These upper tier mutagenic testsare not being proposed at this time. EPA will evaluate the need for thesetests upon receipt of the lower tier test results.EPA is proposing that the TSCA Health Effects Test Guidelines referencedin the above table and as modified in the proposed test standards be usedfor the purposes of the required tests for MEKO. The TSCA test guidelinesfor health effects testing specify generally accepted minimum conditionsfor determining the health effects for substances such as MEKO to whichhumans are expected to be exposed.B. Test SubstanceEPA is proposing that MEKO of at least 99 percent purity be used as thetest substance; MEKO of this purity is commercially available. EPA hasspecified a relatively pure substance for testing because it is interestedin evaluating the effects attributable to MEKO itself.C. Persons Required to TestSection 4(b)(3)(B) specifies that the activities for which EPA makes section4(a) findings (manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use,and/or disposal) determine who bears the responsibility for testing a chemical.Manufacturers and persons who intend to manufacture the chemical are requiredto test if the findings are based on manufacturing (``manufacture'' isdefined in section 3(7) of TSCA to include ``import''). Processors andpersons who intend to process the chemical are required to test if thefindings are based on processing. Manufacturers and processors and personswho intend to manufacture or process the chemical are required to testif exposure giving rise to the potential risk occurs during distributionin commerce, use, or disposal of the chemical.Because EPA has found that there are insufficient data and experience toreasonably determine or predict the effects of the manufacture, processing,and use of MEKO on human health, EPA is proposing that all persons whomanufacture including import or process or intend to manufacture or processMEKO, including persons who manufacture or process or intend to manufactureor process MEKO as a byproduct, or who import or intend to import productswhich contain MEKO, at any time from the effective date of the final testrule to the end of the reimbursement period be subject to the testing requirementscontained in this proposed rule. Persons who manufacture, import, or processMEKO only as an impurity are not subject to these requirements. The endof the reimbursement period will be at least 5 years after the last finalreport is submited; but, if it takes longer than 5 years to submit thelast final report, the reimbursement period will be extended an amountof time equal to that which was required to submit the last final report.Because TSCA containes provisions to avoid duplicative testing, not everyperson subject to this rule must individually conduct testing. Section4(b)(3)(A) of TSCA provides that EPA may permit two or more manufacturersor processors who are subject to the rule to designate one such personor a qualified third person to conduct the tests and submit data on theirbehalf. Section 4(c) provides that any person required to test may applyto EPA for an exemption from the requirement. EPA promulgated proceduresfor applying for TSCA section 4(c) exemptions in 40 CFR Part 790.Manufacturers (including importers) subject to this rule would be requiredto submit either a letter of intent to perform testing or an exemptionapplication within 30 days after the effective date of the final test rule.The required procedures for submitting such letters and applications aredescribed in 40 CFR Part 790.Processors subject to this rule, unless they are also manufacturers, wouldnot be required to submit letters of intent or exemption applications,or to conduct testing, unless manufacturers fail to submit notices of intentto test or later fail to sponsor the required tests. The agency expectsthat the manufacturers will pass an appropriate portion of the costs oftesting on to processors through the pricing of their products or otherreimbursement mechanisms. If manufacturers perform all the required tests,processors will be granted exemptions automatically. If manufacturers failto submit notices of intent to test or fail to sponsor all the requiredtests, the Agency will publish a separate notice in the<T4> Federal Register</T4> to notify processors to respond; this procedureis described in 40 CFR Part 790. Persons conducting tests would submit plans and conduct tests in accordancewith TSCA Good Laboratory Practice Standards (40 CFR Part 792). EPA is not proposing to require the submission of equivalence data as acondition for exemption from the proposed testing for MEKO. As noted inUnit IV.B., EPA is interested in evaluating the effects attributable toMEKO itself and has specified a relatively pure substance for testing.Manufacturers and processors subject to this test rule would comply withthe test rule development and exemption procedures in 40 CFR Part 790 forsingle-phase rulemaking. D. Reporting Requirements All data developed under this rule would be reported in accordance withits TSCA Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) Standards which appear at 40 CFRPart 792. In accordance with 40 CFR Part 790 under single-phase rulemakingprocedures, test sponsors would be required to submit individual studyplans at least 45 days prior to the initiation of each test. EPA is required by TSCA section 4(b)(1)(C) to specify the time period duringwhich persons subject to a test rule must submit test data. The Agency'sproposed reporting requirements for each of the proposed test standardsare specified in the Table in Unit IV.A. Progress reports for all testswould be required at 6-month intervals starting 6 months from the effectivedate of the final test rule. No interim report would be required for thein vivo mammalian bone marrow cytogenetics assay. <ITAG tagnum="84">V. Issues for Comment </ITAG>This proposed rule specifies TSCA test guidelines as the test standards.The Agency is soliciting comments as to whether the test guidelines areappropriate and applicable for the testing of MEKO. Also regarding thetest of MEKO, the Agency requests comments on: 1. Is the testing proposed to characterize the potential health effectsof MEKO adequate? 2. Should EPA require establishment of the NOAEL for blood effects? Availabledata supports concern for blood effects at estimated worker exposure levels.Further testing would confirm and refine the hazard assessment. 3. Are there other testing approaches that should be considered? <ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Economic Analysis of Proposed Rule </ITAG>To evaluate the potential economic impact of this proposed rule, EPA hasprepared an economic analysis that evaluates the potential for significanteconomic impacts on the industry as a result of the proposed testing. Theeconomic analysis estimates the costs of conducting the proposed testingand evaluates the potential costs by examining four market characteristicsof MEKO: Price sensitivity of demand, industry cost characteristics, industrystructure, and market expectations. If these indications are negative,no further economic analysis is performed. However, if the first levelof analysis indicates a potential for significant economic impact, a morecomprehensive and detailed analysis is conducted which more precisely predictsthe magnitude and distribution of the expected impact. Total testing costs for the proposed rule for MEKO are estimated to rangefrom $1.4 to $1.9 million. To predict the financial decisionmaking practicesof manufacturing firms, these costs have been annualized. Annualized costsare compared with annual revenue as an indication of potential impact.The annualized costs represent equivalent constant costs which would haveto be recouped each year of the payback period to finance the testing expenditurein the first year. The annualized test costs, calculated using a cost of capital of 7 percentover a period of 15 years, range from $150,000 to $205,000. Though theannualized unit costs of the tests relative to the product price of MEKOappear to be high, EPA believes that the potential for adverse economicimpact is moderate. This conclusion is based on the following observations:Primarily because of the higher price of viable substitutes, the demandfor MEKO appears to be inelastic with respect to price in its largest enduse as an antiskinning agent in alkyd paints, and the market for MEKO appearsto be stable. Refer to the economic analysis which is contained in the public recordfor this rulemaking for a complete discussion of test cost estimation andpotential for economic impact resulting from these costs (Ref. 2).<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Public Meetings</ITAG>If persons indicate to EPA that they wish to present oral comments on thisproposed rule to EPA officials who are directly responsible for developingthe rule and supporting analyses, EPA will hold a public meeting subsequentto the close of the public comment period in Washington, DC. Persons whowish to attend or to present comments at the meeting should call the TSCAAssistance Office (TAO): (202-554-14-4), by October 31, 1988. A meetingwill not be held if members of the public do not indicate that they wishto make oral presentations. While the meeting will be open to the public,active participation will be limited to those persons who arranged to presentcomments and to designated EPA participants. Attendees should call TAObefore making travel plans to verify whether a meeting will be held.Should a meeting be held, the Agency will transcribe the meeting and includethe written transcript in the rulemaking record. Participants are invited,but not required, to submit copies of their statements prior to or on theday of the meeting. All such written materials will become part of EPA'srecord for this rulemaking.<ITAG tagnum="84">VIII. Availability of Test Facilities and Personnel</ITAG>Section 4(b)(1) of TSCA requires EPA to consider ``* * * the reasonablyforeseeable availability of the facilities and personnel needed to performthe testing required under the rule.'' Therefore, EPA conducted a studyto assess the availability of test facilities and personnel to handle theadditional demand for testing services created by section 4 test rules.Copies of the study, Chemical Testing Industry: Profile of ToxicologicalTesting, can be obtained through the National Technical Information Service(NTIS), 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161 (PB 82-140773). A microfichecopy of this study is also included in the docket for this rule and isavailable to the public for copying. On the basis of this study, the Agencybelieves that there will be available test facilities and personnel toperform the testing specified in this proposed rule.EPA has reviewed the availability of contract laboratory facilities toconduct the required neurotoxicity tests (Ref. 51) and believes that facilitieswill be available for the tests. The laboratory review indicates that fewlaboratories are currently conducting these tests according to TSCA testguidelines and TSCA GLP standards. However, the barriers faced by testinglaboratories to gear up for these tests are not formidable. Laboratorieswill have to invest in testing equipment and personnel training but EPAbelieves that these investments will be recovered as the neurotoxicitytesting program under TSCA section 4 continues. EPA's expectations of laboratoryavailability were borne out under the testing requirements of the C9 aromatichydrocarbon fraction test rule (50 FR 20675; May 17, 1985). Pursuant tothat rule, manufacturers were able to contract with a laboratory to conductthe testing according to TSCA test guidelines and TSCA GLP standards.<ITAG tagnum="84">IX.

Executive Order 12291Under Executive Order 12291, EPA must judge whether a rule is ``major''and therefore subject to the requirement of a Regulatory Impact Analysis.EPA has determined that this test rule would not be major because it doesnot meet any of the criteria set forth in section 1(b) of the Order, i.e.,it would not have any annual effect on the economy of at least $100 million,would not cause a major increase in prices, and would not have a significantadverse effect on competition or the ability of U.S. enterprise to competewith foreign enterprises.This proposed rule was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget(OMB) for review as required by Executive Order 12291. Any written commentsfrom OMB to EPA, and any EPA response to those comments, are included inthe rulemaking record.B. Regulatory Flexibility ActUnder the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.,</T3> Pub. L. 96-354, September 19, 1980), EPA is certifyingthat this test rule, if promulgated, would not have a significant impacton a substantial number of small businesses because: (1) They are not likelyto perform testing themselves, or to participate in the organization ofthe testing effort; (2) they will experience only very minor costs, ifany, in securing exemption from testing requirements; and (3) they areunlikely to be affected by reimbursement requirements.C. Paperwork Reduction Act The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has approved the informationcollection requirements contained in this proposed rule under the provisionsof the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq. </T3>and has assigned OMB control number 2070-0033. Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimatedto average 535 hours per response, including time for reviewing instructions,searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed,and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of thiscollection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden,to Chief, information Policy Branch, PM-223, U.S. Environmental ProtectionAgency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460; and to the Office of Informationand Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.'' The final rule willrespond to any OMB or public comments on the information collection requirementscontained in this proposal. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Parts 798 and 799 </ITAG>Chemicals, Environmental protection, Hazardous substances, Testing Laboratories,Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. <ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: August 26, 1988. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Susan F.

By adding andSection;798.7485 to read as follows: <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;798.7485 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Pharmacokinetics. </ITAG>(a) <T3>Purpose. </T3>The purpose of these studies is to: (1) Ascertain whether the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of a chemicalsubstance or mixture (``test substance'') are similar after oral, dermal,and inhalation administration. (2) Determine bioavailability of a test substance after oral, dermal, andinhalation administration. (3) Examine the effects of dose level and of repeated dosing on the pharmacokineticsand metabolism of the test substance. (b) <T3>Definitions. </T3>(1) ``Bioavailability'' refers to the rate and relativeamount of administered test substance which reaches the systemic circulation.(2) ``Metabolism'' means the study of the sum of the processes by whicha particular substance is handled in the body and includes absorption,tissue distribution, biotransformation, and excretion. (3) ``Percent absorption'' means 100 times the ratio between total excretionof radioactivity following oral, dermal, or inhalation administration andtotal excretion of radioactivity following intravenous administration ofthe test substance. (4) ``Pharmacokinetics'' means the study of the rates of absorption, tissuedistribution, biotransformation, and excretion. (c) <T3>Test procedures</T3>_(1) <T3>Animal selection</T3>_(i) <T3>Species. </T3>The rat shall be used for pharmacokinetics testing becauseit has been used extensively for metabolic and toxicological studies. Fordermal bioavailability studies, the rat and the guinea pig shall be used.(ii) <T3>Animal strains. </T3>Adult male and female rats (strain used for majortoxicity testing) and female guinea pigs shall be used. The rats shallbe 7 to 9 weeks of age and their weight range should be comparable fromgroup to group. The female guinea pigs shall be 5 to 7 weeks old and theirweight range should be comparable from group to group. The animals shouldbe purchased from a reputable dealer and shall be identified upon arrival.The animals shall be selected at random for the testing groups, and anyanimal showing signs of ill health shall not be used. In all studies, unlessotherwise specified, each test group shall contain at least four animalsof each sex for a total of at least eight animals. (iii)<T3> Animal care. </T3>(A) Animal care and housing should be in accordancewith DHEW Publication No. NIH-78-23, 1978, ``Guidelines for the Care andUse of Laboratory Animals.''(B) The animals shall be housed in environmentally controlled rooms withat least 10 air changes per hour. The rooms shall be maintained at a temperatureof 24andplusmin;2 degrees centigrade and humidity of 50andplusmin;10 percentwith a 12-hour light/dark cycle per day. The rats shall be kept in a quarantinefacility for at least 7 days prior to use, and shall be acclimated to theexperimental environment for a minimum of 48 hours prior to treatment.(C) During the acclimatization period, the animals shall be housed in suitablecages. All animals shall be provided with certified feed and tap water<T3>ad libitum. </T3>The guinea pig diet shall be supplemented with adequateamounts of ascorbic acid in the drinking water.(2) <T3>Administration of test substance</T3>_(i) <T3>Test substance. </T3>The use of a radioactive test substance is requiredfor all studies. Ideally, the purity of both radioactive and nonradioactivetest substances should be greater than 99 percent. The radioactive andnonradioactive substances shall be chromatographed separately and togetherto establish purity and identity. If the purity is less than 99 percentor if the chromatograms differ significantly, EPA should be consulted.(ii) <T3>Dosage and treatment</T3>_(A) <T3>Intravenous</T3>. The low dose of each test substance, in an appropriatevehicle, shall be administered intravenously to four rats of each sex.(B) <T3>Oral. </T3>Two doses of the test substance shall be used in the oralportion of the study, a low dose and a high dose. The high dose shouldideally induce some overt toxicity, such as sedation, irritation or weightloss. Both the high and low dose levels should be accomplished by gavageor by administering encapsulated test substance. If feasible, the samehigh and low doses should be used for oral and dermal studies.(C)<T3> Inhalation.</T3> Two concentrations of each test substance shall beused in this portion of the study, a low concentration and high concentration.The high concentration should ideally induce some overt toxicity, whilethe low concentration should correspond to a no-observed-adverse-effectlevel. Inhalation treatment should be conducted using a ``nose-cone'' or``head only'' apparatus to prevent ingestion of test substance through``grooming.''(D) <T3>Dermal</T3>-(<T3>1</T3>) <T3>Dermal treatment. </T3>For dermal treatment, two doses, comparableto the low and high oral doses when feasible, shall be dissolved in a suitablevehicle and applied in volumes adequate to deliver the doses. The backsof the animals should be lightly shaved with an electric clipper 24 hoursbefore treatment. The test substance shall be applied to the intact shavenskin (approximately 2 cm\2\ for rats, 5 cm\2\ for guinea pigs). The dosedareas shall be protected with a suitable porous covering which is securedin place, and the animals shall be housed separately. When the test substancehas signficant volatility, the methodology of Susten et al.

After application (2 to 5 minutes), the treatedareas of two rats and two guinea pigs shall be washed with soap and waterand the treated area of the remaining animals shall be washed with an appropriatesolvent. The amounts of test substance recovered in the washing shall bedetermined to assess the efficacy of its removal by washing.(iii) <T3>Dosing and sampling schedule</T3>_(A) <T3>Rat studies</T3>. After administration of the test substance, eachrat shall be placed in a separate metabolic unit to facilitate collectionof excreta. For the dermal and inhalation studies, excreta from the ratsshall also be collected during the exposure periods. At the end of eachcollection period, the metabolic units shall be cleaned to recover anyexcreta that might adhere to them. All studies, except the repeated dosestudies, shall be terminated at 7 days, or after at least 90 percent ofthe radioactivity has been recovered in the excreta, whichever occurs first.(<T3>1</T3>) <T3>Intravenous study. </T3>Group A shall be dosed once intravenously atthe low dose of test substance.(<T3>2</T3>) <T3>Oral Studies. </T3>(<T3>i</T3>) Group B shall be dosed once <T3>per os </T3>with the low dose of test substance.(<T3>ii</T3>) Group C shall be dosed once <T3>per os </T3>with the high dose of test substance.(<T3>3</T3>) <T3>Inhalation studies. </T3>A single 6-hour exposure period shall be usedfor each group.(<T3>i</T3>) Group D shall be exposed to a mixture of test substance inair at the low concentration.(<T3>ii</T3>) Group E shall be exposed to a mixture of test substance inair at the high concentration.(<T3>4</T3>) <T3>Dermal studies. </T3>Unless precluded by corrosivity, the test substanceshall be applied and kept on the skin for a minimum of 6 hours.
