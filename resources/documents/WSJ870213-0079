BarnesStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 02/13/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> CCBTELECOMMUNICATIONS, BROADCASTING, TELEPHONE, TELEGRAPH (TEL) </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Capital Cities/ABC Inc. has emerged from a year of tumult richer, trimmer and more stable. But the broadcasting and publishing concern remains saddled with a third-place television network that has yet to show any signs of revival.    Almost 14 months after Capital Cities Communications Inc. acquired American Broadcasting Cos. for $3.5 billion, management says it has laid the groundwork for a turnaround in the network, which accounts for about half of the merged company's revenue. But the strategy for recovery remains risky, is being implemented by a relatively inexperienced programming team, and might not stem losses at the network for several more years, if at all.    &quot;The company is in good shape,&quot; contends Thomas S. Murphy, chairman and chief executive officer. &quot;We just have to fix the network,&quot; which had an operating loss of more than $70 million last year before special accounting adjustments, compared with pre-tax operating profit of $100 million in 1985.    Among other moves, network executives are trying to boost ratings by attracting producers, directors and writers to ABC who they hope will produce much-needed new hit shows, and are seeking to cut costs of expensive sports programming, which is a major reason for the losses. In the search for other sources of revenue, they are even considering putting home shopping programs on late at night.    The network losses continue despite months of cost-cutting and streamlining that chopped more than 1,000 people from ABC's 11,000-person payroll and forced out dozens of top and mid-level managers. The company led the three major TV networks in cost-cutting drives that reflect concern about slower growth in national advertising.    The resulting turmoil and disarray at ABC left morale low and remaining employes uncertain about their future. But now, relative calm has set in. Among most survivors, morale and unity are improving, company sources say.    At the company's annual management meeting last year in Phoenix, Ariz., held several weeks after the January merger, executives were given halves of $10 bills and encouraged to meet each other by finding the associate with the corresponding half. &quot;This year, they didn't feel they had to do that,&quot; one manager says of last month's Phoenix meeting. &quot;Last year, it was more like 'you and me.' This year, it was much more a feeling of 'We are all together now.'&quot;    Nonetheless, some employees remain concerned that the bloodletting isn't over, particularly at the unprofitable network and ABC News. Also, rumors that Capital Cities may sell its network operations surface weekly. News employees are particularly alarmed by reports last week that the estimated $300 million budget of CBS Inc.'s news division may be cut by as much as $50 million; ABC News employees believe Capital Cities may follow suit.    Mr. Murphy says the network isn't for sale: &quot;We intend to stay&quot; in the business. He says he doesn't plan to seek major budget cuts at ABC News, though companywide, &quot;We're always looking at every opportunity to save money.&quot; But, &quot;The bulk of (cost-cutting) has been done,&quot; he declares.    On shows such as &quot;Our World,&quot; an hourlong news program introduced this season, ABC News already is employing some temporary workers who don't collect benefits and are easy to dismiss if the show fails. And, in the wake of the CBS announcement, ABC sources say news executives are likely to review at least some operations for additional cost savings -- without orders from top management.    Such reviews, an unwritten policy at Capital Cities before the ABC acquisition, are becoming standard procedure at the merged company. Capital Cities executives are known for their strict attention to continual expense control and for their emphasis on autonomy for managers running operating units.    &quot;They allowed me to run the station,&quot; says William Fyffe, who until recently was general manager of WABC-TV, New York, and resigned from the company by &quot;mutual agreement&quot; with top management. &quot;The old ABC was considerably more bureaucratic.&quot;    Meanwhile, ABC executives appear to have learned to live without limousines and other bygone ABC perquisites. In December, the company dropped its last chauffeur-driven car. &quot;'The Last Limousine' -- someone said that would make a great TV movie,&quot; one executive quips.    The changes haven't all been one way, however. Capital Cities executives, for example, now seem more accustomed to the spotlight that network TV invites. They blundered soon after the merger, with public relations mishaps. They were caught last year, for example, in a controversy over the proposed use of dogs to sniff out drugs at the company's newspaper operations in Kansas City, Mo.    John B. Sias, the colorful former head of Capital Cities' publishing operations who was named head of the ABC network division after the merger, has toned down his public antics in light of the network's serious troubles. Once last year, he showed up at ABC News wearing a fake beard; the clowning was considered ill-timed and insensitive, for the division then was laying off employees. More recently, Mr. Sias has limited his joking to more private settings, executives say; for example, calling up a colleague and posing as a government investigator.    So far, the company's expense-reduction efforts appear to be paying off. Last April, the company said it expected 1986 earnings of about $7 to $8 a share, mainly because of the network's poor performance. This week, however, Capital Cities surprised investors and analysts when it reported 1986 operating profit of $181.9 million, or $11.20 a share, before one-time gains, on revenue of about $4.1 billion.    The earnings mainly reflected strong results at the company's eight TV stations, which have been helped by cost-cutting and healthy local TV advertising. But at the network, assuming little change in the ratings and no upturn in national advertising or major cost reductions, losses could grow in 1987, company sources say. Because of the huge expense base of a network -- about $2 billion annually -- relatively small swings in sales or expenses can translate into big gains in network profit -- or big losses.    Adding to the pressure to improve overall ratings, the company faces two financial land mines it inherited from ABC in its programming: It paid $309 million for the rights to broadcast the 1988 winter Olympics, and it is spending more than $100 million to produce a 30-hour miniseries, &quot;War andamp; Remembrance,&quot; for broadcast in the 1988-89 season at the earliest. Next week, ABC will air another costly project that new management inherited, &quot;Amerika,&quot; a $40 million miniseries depicting life in the U.S. a decade after a bloodless takeover by the Soviet Union.    Without bigger audiences overall, heftier cost reductions or more advertising revenues, these projects alone could prolong the network's losses through at least 1989. The company may get lucky with advertising next year, though, because of the presidential election and Olympic Games, which historically have brought greater ad spending.    In one significant cost-cutting effort, ABC Sports President Dennis Swanson is trying to reduce payments of more than $300 million that ABC is scheduled to pay under the remaining three years of a six-year contract to air professional baseball games, industry sources say. In exchange, they say, ABC may agree to commit to three more years of the contract under a level payment schedule. An ABC spokeswoman declined to comment. ABC also is expected to take a hard line on the pending negotiations for professional football broadcast rights.    Despite the success of such prime-time ABC shows as &quot;Moonlighting&quot; and &quot;Who's the Boss?&quot;, the network's overall audience continues to decline. So far this season, ABC's share of the prime-time network audience is down 4.3% from the end of the 1985-86 season. Viewership of one mainstay, &quot;Dynasty,&quot; is off 19% for the season to date.    To try to repair the network's schedule, Brandon Stoddard, ABC Entertainment president, has reshuffled the division's top management, replacing 10 of 14 programming executives. The new team inherited most of the ABC programming now on the air, so the first test of its ability will be in the coming fall season.    Mr. Stoddard also has sought to rid ABC of its reputation as the most &quot;meddlesome&quot; of the three major networks, betting that Hollywood's most talented creative people will come to ABC and produce hits if they are given more freedom to exercise their craft. Former ABC programming executives often were criticized for insisting on, among other things, many changes in scripts and casting. In the search for quality writing, which is acknowledged as the most important element of good shows, he is approving commitments for pilot programs earlier to allow writers more time to produce scripts.    Mr. Stoddard's early efforts are winning praise in some Hollywood circles. Michael A. Zinberg, executive producer of the now-canceled ABC series &quot;Heart of the City,&quot; says that in a clash with ABC officials over a script ABC didn't like, &quot;It came down to who was the producer of the show. They said, 'You are,' and we shot the show.&quot; The network hasn't surrendered control over its shows, he says, but there is a &quot;spirit of give and take&quot; at the network now.    Mr. Stoddard's campaign appears to be working to some degree. In September, Mike Nichols, the award-winning Broadway and movie director, agreed to produce two series for ABC, and in December, Michael Leeson, co-creator of NBC's popular &quot;The Cosby Show,&quot; also agreed to make two shows for ABC. But Mr. Stoddard paid a heavy price for their involvement -- a two-series commitment is a major departure from usual network practice.    Mr. Stoddard hopes that, given the high failure rate of new network shows, his strategy will produce at least two or three shows a year &quot;that are going to stick&quot; and help rebuild the network. Mr. Murphy, the chief executive, says Mr. Stoddard is under no pressure to produce immediate results. Mr. Murphy gives the turnaround effort two or three years.    Mr. Stoddard may need that much time. The risk in his strategy, executives note, is that shows aren't guaranteed to be hits by signing big names and giving creative people more freedom to work and more time to write scripts. &quot;It's more of a roll of the dice,&quot; Mr. Stoddard acknowledges. </TEXT></DOC>
