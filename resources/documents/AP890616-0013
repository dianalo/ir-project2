(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Stung by a series of corruptionallegations, black leaders across Alabama are accusing federalauthorities of racial harassment, but one U.S. attorney says he andhis colleagues are ``equal-opportunity prosecutors.''   Richard Arrington, a former college professor serving his thirdterm as Birmingham's first black mayor, said federal agents tried toframe him through a developer who faces tax bribery charges, andother black officials say their phones have been tapped or they havebeen the target of unjustified investigations.   At Arrington's request, a special state prosecutor has been namedto review the actions of the federal agents, and the federalgovernment's own office that investigates bias allegations againstlaw enforcement authorities is looking into the matter. The SenateJudiciary Committee staff is also reviewing the allegations.   Blacks in Alabama began flexing ballot box strength after passageof the 1965 Voting Rights Act, and now hold more than 1,000 electiveoffices in the state, including 24 of the 141 seats in the AlabamaLegislature.   Three black legislators from the Birmingham area are underindictment on federal charges they tried to bribe a formerlegislator, who is white, in connection with a proposed dog track.Their attorneys contend race bias was a factor that led to theirindictment.   Thomas Reed, the state NAACP president, was convicted of federalbribery charges in September and stripped of his seat in the stateHouse. He was accused of accepting $10,000 to use his influence toget early parole for a convicted killer. Reed contends hisprosecution was spurred by his high profile opposition to the flyingof the Confederate flag atop the Capitol.   Those cases, and reports of FBI surveillance of other blacks,amount to selective harassment, according to Arrington and others.   Fred Gray, a black attorney who is a veteran of the civil rightsmovement, said the actions are part of a pattern that began withPresident Reagan's arrival at the White House eight years ago andcontinues under President Bush.   ``All of this is a conspiracy on the part of the administrationto destroy black leadership and black political power,'' Gray said.   State Sen. Hank Sanders, a Democrat, claims that more than halfthe black elected officials in the state are under investigation orsurveillance.   But U.S. Attorney Jim Wilson of Montgomery said the JusticeDepartment is colorblind.   ``We're equal-opportunity prosecutors,'' he said. ``We'llprosecute any crook in the district, any time.''   At Birmingham, U.S. Attorney Frank Donaldson said the harassmentaccusations were too absurd to deserve comment.   As for Sanders' claim that half of the black officials aretargets of some kind of investigation, ``It doesn't ring true tome,'' said Gerald Shockley, an FBI spokesman.   At Arrington's request, state Attorney General Don Siegelmannamed a special prosecutor to investigate actions of the FBI and theInternal Revenue Service. Arrington said he wanted a determinationof whether agents ``engaged in criminal solicitation, conspiracy,attempted bribery and-or obstruction'' of Birmingham's government.   Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala., a member of the U.S. Senate JudiciaryCommittee, said Wednesday that the panel's staff is making apreliminary investigation and a decision will be made later onwhether to refer the matter to the full committee.   The assistant counsel for the Office of ProfessionalResponsibility in Washington, David Bobzien, said he and aninvestigator will visit Birmingham next week to conduct interviewsin response to a request by Arrington's attorney.   Bobzien's office was created in 1975 to look into complaintsabout employees of the Justice Department and other investigativeagencies.   It was disclosed this week that Arrington has been a subject ofFBI scrutiny at various times dating back to 1972 when he was a citycouncilman supporting blacks alleging police brutality.   The FBI investigated Arrington for possible bribery and financialconflicts of interest involving his business partners but no chargeshave been filed. The mayor was interviewed by the FBI in 1985.   A report Thursday in the Birmingham Post-Herald also said that anew series of court-sanctioned FBI wiretaps has been used to monitorthe telephone conversations of at least two members of the JeffersonCounty legislative delegation, Reps. John Rogers and Pat Davis.   FBI wiretaps were used last year in the investigation that led tothe indictments in the dog track case.   FBI spokesman Tom Moore declined to comment on the latestwiretaps.   ``I have been operating on the assumption that the phone wastapped,'' Rogers said. ``I resent the investigation. I haven't doneanything.''   Mark Polson, a lawyer representing Ms. Davis, said he did nothave ``the foggiest idea'' why her phone was tapped but says it is``more than a coincidence that it is the black politicians who arecatching all the heat.''</TEXT></DOC>
