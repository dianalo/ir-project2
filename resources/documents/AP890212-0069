In the race for a seat in Parliament's upper house, SocialistSadao Fuchigami defeated Kei Oma of Prime Minister NoboruTakeshita's party, according to election officials in southernFukuoka prefecture.   In celebrations televised by the Japan Broadcasting Corp.,Fuchigami told his supporters: ``The people's complaints against the(stock) scandal and consumer tax led to my victory.''   Tsuruo Yamaguchi, secretary-general of the Japan Socialist Party,said his party will call for the resignation of Takeshita's Cabinet,dissolution of Parliament's more powerful lower house and a generalelection, Kyodo News Service reported.   Kyodo said the Liberal Democratic Party's secretary-general,Shintaro Abe, promised his party would accept the election outcomeand go to work on reforms to restore public confidence.   Sunday's election was the first involving a national office sincethe stock scandal surfaced last summer and since Parliament passed a3 percent sales tax in December.   The stock scandal has led to the resignations of three members ofTakeshita's Cabinet and more than a dozen other prominentpoliticians and businessmen. It also has raised questions aboutinfluence peddling.   The election was seen as a possible indicator of what mighthappen in July when elections are held for half the seats inParliament's upper house. Liberal Democrats now hold 143 of the 251seats.   Severe setbacks in the elections would endanger Takeshita'schances of winning another two-year term as party president andprime minister next October.   Sunday's special election was for the seat held by a LiberalDemocrat who died in December.   With all the votes counted by late Sunday night, the electioncommittee said Fuchigami garnered 751,036 votes against 564,301 forOma, 170,778 for Tatsuzen Fujino of the Japan Communist Party and160,294 for Kozo Maeda of the Salaried Workers' New Party.   Fuchigami, 51, is vice chairman of the Japan Socialist Party'sFukuoka prefectural branch.   An estimated 48.6 percent of the 3.4 million eligible voters castballots Sunday, compared with 74.5 percent in the previous upperhouse election in 1986 and 56.8 percent in 1983. The 1986 turnoutwas high because the election was held with one in the more powerfullower house.   Japan's current Parliament session opened Friday.   Takeshita told lawmakers that he will ``honestly accept the harshcriticism'' over the stock scandal and try to restore publicconfidence in government.   The scandal involves Recruit Co., an information servicesconglomerate that has been accused of trying to gain favor inpolitical circles.   It sold unlisted stocks in a subsidiary, Recruit-Cosmos realestate company, at bargain prices to more than 150 influentialpoliticians, bureaucrats and journalists before public trading inthe shares began in October 1986.   The share prices rose sharply then, and some buyers made nearly$80,000 in tax-free profits.</TEXT></DOC>
