The investigation, once limited to allegations of a conspiracybetween Drexel and now-imprisoned speculator Ivan Boesky, has beenfrustrated by a lack of substantive evidence and is spreading intopossibly questionable dealings between the firm and otherindividuals, these sources said Friday.   Evidence for the broadened probe is coming from three Drexelhigh-yield bond traders, James Dahl, Cary Maultasch and TerrenPeizer, who are known to be cooperating with the government inexchange for lenient treatment.   These developments suggested the negotiations between Drexel andthe Manhattan U.S. attorney, which have been going on for the pastseveral weeks, remain substantially unresolved, despite predictionsthat a break in one of the biggest securities fraud cases in historycould come before Christmas.   Bruce Baird, the assistant Manhattan U.S. attorney for securitiesfraud, declined to comment on the Drexel case. Drexel spokesmanSteven Anreder also declined to comment.   The nation's fifth-largest securities firm has been negotiatingintensely with the U.S. attorney's office to avoid a potentiallyruinous indictment on fraud and racketeering charges, the result ofthe investigation rooted in the Boesky insider trading scandal.   As the negotiations have dragged on, unconfirmed reports,conflicting speculation and leaks of imminent settlements and suddensnags have persisted.   Earlier in the week rumors flew that the firm's high-yield bondexecutive Michael Milken, another key target in the probe, hadresigned abruptly. The rumor was officially denied.   Some sources disputed another report Friday that suggested a riftwas growing in Drexel's senior management over terms of asettlement, which could include hundreds of millions of dollars infines, multiple guilty pleas and restraints on some of the firm'smost profitable operations.   A settlement also would almost certainly include the ouster ofMilken, who regardless of what happens to Drexel is expected to beindicted.   The Wall Street Journal said key Drexel executives Leon Black andPeter Ackerman were threatening to resign if a proposed agreementrequired the firm to cooperate with the government in prosecutingMilken, the driving force behind the firm's prowess in the $175billion high-yield ``junk bond'' market.   ``They didn't threaten to quit,'' said one source in response tothe Journal account. ``No such threat was made. They're stillaboard.''   Others with knowledge of the situation said some Drexelexecutives were growing exasperated with the government's toughnegotiating position and were increasingly opposed to a settlement,preferring to scrap it out in court.   ``Some people are saying, what the government's asking isunconscionable,'' said one source. ``If the government has its way,it's selling Milken out. It's not fair and it's not right.''   Drexel and Milken have repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in theprotracted legal ordeal, which began after Boesky turned state'sevidence and paid the Securities and Exchange Commission a record$100 million fine for insider trading two years ago.</TEXT></DOC>
