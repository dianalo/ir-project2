Vietnam announced Wednesday that it has temporarily halted plansfor joint efforts to account for missing Americans and forresettling former political prisoners in the United States.   Agreements on the issues had been reached last month.   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, ``Weare very concerned, because we thought we were making some progressat getting the investigations going about MIA's and POW's.''   ``Our position has always been clear,'' Fitzwater said. ``Iguess we're a little surprised and not quite sure what Vietnam isup to here.''   The Vietnam News Agency said Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thachwrote a letter dated Sunday to Gen. John W. Vessey, a special U.S.presidential emissary, saying the decision to halt cooperation wasin response to recent congressional testimony by AssistantSecretary of State Gaston Sigur.   Sigur on July 28 argued against a congressional resolutionurging the establishment of ``interest sections'' _ diplomaticmissions below the level of embassies _ in Hanoi and Washington,saying they would not improve cooperation on humanitarian issues.   He called for continued U.S. isolation of Vietnam until it endsit decade-old military occupation of Cambodia.   Thach spoke with reporters in Bangkok today after holding talkson Cambodia with Thailand's Foreign Minister Siddhi Savetsila.   Asked how long Vietnam was suspending cooperation on U.S.humanitarian issues, he replied: ``I would like to ask Gen. Vesseythis question, how long they will continue such hostile policyagainst my government?''   He said it was not a question of the United States apologizing,but rather ``a question of hostile policy against my country, tostop it.''   Thach and Vessey reached an agreement in August 1987 under whichVietnam pledged to accelerate its accounting of nearly 1,800Americans listing as missing in action in the Vietnam war. TheUnited States pledged to help Vietnam with its humanitarianproblems.   Thach told Vessey last month that Vietnam will try to resolve 70top priority MIA cases by the end of the year and welcomed jointexcavations for remains from August to October.   There have no such excavations since the first one in late 1985.   Technical experts of the two sides met in Hanoi last week towork out arrangements and U.S. officials said they anticipatedjoint surveys and investigations that would begin soon.   The two countries held talks in Hanoi last month on America'soffer to resettle former U.S. government employees and officials ofthe U.S.-backed South Vietnam government who were put into``re-education camps'' after the 1975 North Vietnamese victory.   A joint communique said Vietnam was allowing them to emigrate asthe United States gave assurances it would not encourage them toconduct anti-Vietnamese activities.   But the official Vietnamese media later blamed the U.S. for lackof progress, saying the biggest obstacle was the U.S. refusal toset up a ``working group'' to organize the emigration of about500,000 of the former inmates and their relatives.</TEXT></DOC>
