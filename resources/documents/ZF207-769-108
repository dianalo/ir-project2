LaserJet line of printers andcompatibles.andP;  Font systems tested also had to be able to generate on-screenequivalents of the printer fonts.andP;  The products reviewed were Fontware, FontSolution Pack, Digi-Duit! Typeface Library, Type Director Premium Collectionand MoreFonts.andM;The packages were tested on a Dell Computer Corp. Model 310 386-based PC with4M bytes of extended memory.andP;  The machine was running Windows/386.andM;A Windows installation kit was requested from each vendor as well as severalpopular book typefaces--Garamond, Palatino and Century Schoolbook.andP;  Eachproduct was timed as it created a test set of identical fonts in the samepoint sizes.andP;  Each font then was installed for Windows according to eachvendors' instructions.andM;Fontware offers top-quality performance with solid, clean fonts and a quickand efficient font-generation facility.andP;  The Font Solution Pack, using thesame font-generation technology, produces output that is identical toFontware's.andM;Its bonus is the exhaustive set of tools and utilities that allow the user tomanipulate Bitstream font outlines in thousands of permutations.andM;Hewlett-Packard's Type Director offers an intuitive and easy-to-use interfaceas well as very good documentation to get users started generating fonts andusing soft-font technology.andM;At the less expensive end of the spectrum, MoreFonts and Digi-Duit! offerimpressive output and the ability to select a number of special effects.andO;Digi-Duit!'s huge variety of fonts (more than 270) represents an amazingvalue.andP;  At less than $2 per typeface, users should be able to find almost anyfont they need.andM;Ultimately, users who create professional documents for wide distributionwill want to stick with the high-end products for quality and typefaceavailability.andM;Users with less stringent requirements, however, will find good value in theless expensive products.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
