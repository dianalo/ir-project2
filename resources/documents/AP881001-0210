MARTINEZ</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A new rule that could phase out municipal bearerbonds spells good news for the industry but not necessarily forpeople who have been using them to conceal income from the InternalRevenue Service or who like their privacy.   Under an industry rule that took effect Sept. 18, allinterchangeable securities will be registered in a person's namewhen traded, rather than the traditional ``blank check'' form underthe old method.   A bearer bond carries no owner's name on the issuer's books andno name on the certificate. Since no record of ownership exists,bearer bonds have been favored by investors wishing to illegallyavoid gift, estate or other taxes.   The holder of a bearer bond can redeem it by taking the bondcoupon to a bank or brokerage for payment and remain anonymous inthe process.   The latest rule change was prompted by Wall Street brokers whowanted to cut costs and make processing of the bonds moreefficient, said Angela Desmond, general counsel for the MunicipalSecurities Rulemaking Board, the industry regulatory group thatpassed the new regulation.   It stemmed from the 1983 tax reform act that banned the issuanceof new bearer bonds.   Since all tax-free municipal bonds sold since 1983 have beenregistered with ownership recorded in computerized form, dealersreason that it would be easier and more cost-effective to deliverall bonds in registered form.   In addition, registered bonds carry lower risk for all partiesinvolved, said Bill Rybak, senior vice president of operations withVan Kampen Merritt Inc.   ``It's easier to track them down if they're lost or stolen,''Rybak said. ``If you misplace a bearer bond, the next person whohas it has a negotiable instrument. It's like picking up a $5 billon the ground.''   Indeed, bearer bonds figured in a big securities heist in May1987, when three men were arrested trying to rob a billion-dollarshipment of no-name bonds outside the Depository Trust Co.   The new rule gives Depository Trust, keeper of most of themunicipals held in depositories, sole discretion to decide whetherto convert some $75 billion of bearer bonds to registered form,said Barry Zucker, president of J.B. Hanauer andamp; Co.   Depository Trust likes the idea of being able to clear out itscluttered vaults so the rule is likely to lead to a phasing out ofbearer bonds.   The change gives people who desire the anonymity of bearer bondslittle choice except to hold the bonds themselves, some analystssay.   Most bond buyers turn their securities over to their brokers,who in turn hold them in the Depository Trust or some otherdepository.   Because of the anonymity factor as well as supply and demand,bearer bonds at one time commanded a premium price, analysts said.But the 1983 reforms changed all that.   ``We're in a registered environment now,'' Desmond said. ``Ifpeople are paying more for bearer bonds, that will change soonbecause there really isn't any intrinsic value to holding a bearerbond.''   However, many people prefer keeping their investmentsconfidential, whether to conceal income from the IRS or for otherreasons, so the new rule can be disquieting, analysts say.   ``People feel it's a privacy factor, a matter of anonymity''Zucker said, adding that concealing income is not the main reasonpeople are opposed to the rule since banks are required to makeredemption reports.   Bearer bonds account for about one third of the muni market now,but that is expected to shrink by 1992, when many existing issueswill pass their 10-year call dates.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Weekend Editions Oct. 1-2</NOTE></DOC>
