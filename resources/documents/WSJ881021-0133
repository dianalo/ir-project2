And that means slower growth for its smaller rivals, MCI Communications Corp. and US Sprint Communications Co.    Still, barring major regulatory changes, both ATandamp;T competitors will post double-digit revenue gains and healthy earnings increases during the next couple of years, industry analysts say, as the industry becomes a businessman's dream: an oligopoly in a growing market with declining costs. For the first time since competition appeared 15 years ago, ATandamp;T's rivals are beginning to benefit from the same economies of scale that the giant enjoys.    &quot;It's clear that ATandamp;T isn't going to sit back in 1989 and watch its market share erode,&quot; says Robert Morris III of Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. &quot;Life will get tougher&quot; for MCI and US Sprint, he says, but &quot;MCI is making money and has enough market share for economies of scale to produce earnings growth.&quot; For US Sprint, which had a $1.15 billion loss before taxes last year but will probably turn a profit soon, &quot;the question is how profitable do you get?&quot; says Mr. Morris. &quot;You can get double-digit earnings growth and still eke out a meager return.&quot;    With the $50 billion market growing 10% a year, says Bert Roberts, president of MCI, &quot;this industry is plenty big for three big carriers,&quot; even with a more aggressive ATandamp;T. MCI probably won't repeat its sixfold earnings increase reported this week for the third quarter, says Mr. Roberts. But revenue should continue growing between 30% and 40% annually with &quot;healthy&quot; growth in quarterly earnings, he says.    Similarly, now that it is no longer spending $1 billion annually to build a network, and has some big costs under control, US Sprint will turn profitable soon, industry executives say. How profitable &quot;depends on how well we manage and compete,&quot; says US Sprint President William Esrey. &quot;It's an economy-of-scale business and the only way you build returns is to get customers.&quot;    ATandamp;T's decision to make its regular long-distance traffic all-digital by the end of 1990 will hurt US Sprint's marketing efforts, which rely heavily on its claim to be the only network that is all fiber optic and digital, analysts say.    Still, both MCI and US Sprint, a joint venture of GTE Corp. and United Telecommunications Inc., are benefiting from a major change in psychology at big corporations, says Mr. Esrey. &quot;Companies are more willing to select a carrier other than ATandamp;T as their primary carrier,&quot; he says. &quot;That attitude change has occurred in the past two years.&quot; Ed Greenberg, an analyst at Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., says his survey of corporate telecommunications executives this year showed a surprising change: 38% said that by 1990 they would choose MCI as their main long-distance company, up from only 11% in last year's survey.    &quot;Thirteen months ago, accounts with more than $250,000 in monthly billings were 6% of our overall revenue,&quot; says Mr. Roberts of MCI. &quot;Today those accounts are 17% of overall revenue. That shows tremendous penetration in the large-account marketplace.&quot;    MCI and US Sprint are also gaining big-business customers because they have only recently entered markets that were the exclusive province of ATandamp;T. Once the only seller of 800 and international services, ATandamp;T now must compete with MCI and US Sprint in those lucrative, fast-growing markets. Just this week, a court ruling ordered the Bell operating companies to grant ATandamp;T's rivals greater access to selling long-distance service through coin phones.    Still, ATandamp;T's huge shadow continues to strike fear in the hearts of some executives. Despite their gains, both MCI and US Sprint say ATandamp;T, with a market share between 70% and 80% depending on how it's measured, is too big to be deregulated. Currently, ATandamp;T's profits and prices are regulated by state commissions and the Federal Communications Commission. ATandamp;T is barred from cutting prices without regulatory approval and must go through a public-approval process each time it wants to reprice or repackage its long-distance services. But the deregulation-minded FCC has granted ATandamp;T more pricing flexibility and has proposed an end to profit regulation, to the dismay of ATandamp;T competitors.    Mr. Roberts calls &quot;illegal&quot; a recently approved ATandamp;T pricing plan called Tariff 15, which allows ATandamp;T to cut prices for customers that are offered lower prices from competitors. He says MCI's market share must rise to between 15% and 20% from its current 11% before ATandamp;T can be fully deregulated. &quot;ATandamp;T mightn't be a monopoly, but it has monopoly power,&quot; says Mr. Esrey of US Sprint. &quot;If ATandamp;T wanted to price in a predatory manner, they can do that.&quot; He says it will be &quot;well into the 1990s&quot; before ATandamp;T should be fully deregulated.    Mr. Esrey stops short of claiming ATandamp;T is abusing its monopoly power. But ATandamp;T is clearly more aggressive. A potential write-off this year reflects ATandamp;T's plans to make 95% of its regular, so-called switched, domestic long-distance traffic travel on digital facilities by mid-1989 with all traffic running on digital facilities by the end of 1992. Previously, ATandamp;T said traffic wouldn't all run on digital facilities until the end of 1995. In addition, ATandamp;T executives say they will file tariff after tariff to keep customers happy, no matter how much competitors scream. In public and private statements recently, ATandamp;T executives have said they see no reason why the phone giant should lose one more point in market share.    Joseph Nacchio, vice president, business services, argues vehemently that if ATandamp;T has market power, so do its competitors. Why else, he asks, would ATandamp;T be losing business revenue to MCI and US Sprint? &quot;Market power is defined as having the ability to prevent entry into the industry and the ability to raise prices indiscriminately,&quot; says Mr. Nacchio. &quot;I can't keep entrants out or raise prices indiscriminately. Our competitors achieve competitive advantage when they tie us down through the regulatory process and exercise their own market power. I don't spend my time worrying about whether the industry is an oligopoly. I spend my time worrying why other firms are growing 40% and we aren't.&quot;    In a recent speech to ATandamp;T managers, Sam R. Willcoxon, president of ATandamp;T's Business Markets Group, said more than 1,300 staff employees have moved to sales positions to coddle business customers being wooed by competitors. Those new salespeople have already called on 44,000 long-distance customers, winning back $25 million of revenue for ATandamp;T and keeping competitors from snatching another $300 million in revenue. This week, ATandamp;T restructured Wide Area Telecommunications Services, hoping to keep rivals from luring away more of its middle-sized business customers.    Indeed, Jack Grubman of PaineWebber Inc. says the awakening of ATandamp;T will halve revenue growth of MCI and US Sprint in 1990, to about 15% annually, but because of greater efficiencies earnings won't slow that much. He estimates MCI will earn $2.70 a share in 1990, more than doubling from $1.30 a share this year. United Telecommunications, which is buying out GTE's share of US Sprint, will see earnings explode to $5.40 in 1990, up from a paltry $1.90 this year, he says.    &quot;That is why the stocks are still cheap,&quot; says Mr. Grubman, because both are selling at near the market multiple for the Sandamp;P 500. Mr. Morris of Goldman Sachs says MCI shares could rise as high as $30 in the next 12 to 18 months. In yesterday's national over-the-counter trading, MCI shares closed at $23.50, up 87.5 cents.    &quot;The risk to these guys is how aggressive ATandamp;T really gets,&quot; says Mr. Grubman. &quot;I think they will get a lot more aggressive, but the growth of the industry and operating leverage takes care of a lot of sins.&quot; Because no well-heeled, knowledgeable company such as a foreign concern or Bell operating company is legally allowed to enter the long-distance industry, says Mr. Grubman, it will probably remain a protected, domestic oligopoly.    Declares Mr. Roberts of MCI: &quot;We aren't afraid to face ATandamp;T head-to-head in the marketplace. But everything is dwarfed if the Bells are let into long distance. Then there would be no competition.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
