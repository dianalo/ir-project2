They do when the dummies are in patrol cars, that is.    With plenty of highways and only 12 deputies on its force, the county Sheriff's Department decided to try something different: Put a mannequin in a radar-equipped car and set the car along busy stretches of road.    &quot;The average individual, when he sees a patrol car, does one of two things: hit the brakes or check the speedometer,&quot; observes Chief Deputy Jack Dillon. Who -- or what -- is inside the car doesn't matter, he maintains.    Deputy 92-0, as the dummy has been dubbed, is a female form that used to model clothes in Spurgeons, a local retailer. Although she can't write tickets, the radio in her car is programmed to trigger radar detectors.    On duty, the dishwater blonde sports mirrored shades and a regulation green and brown uniform. In addition, she holds a microphone up to her mouth.    &quot;It does do the job. People slow down,&quot; says Vickie Flynn, assistant manager at Exporter Elevator in Westchester, Iowa. The mannequin-equipped patrol car has been stationed near her company on three separate occasions. &quot;Until we knew what was going on, we were all wondering if we had a woman officer in this county.&quot;    Other unsuspecting residents have called the sheriff to complain that a patrol car has been sitting in front of their house all day.    Besides saving wear and tear on patrol cars, the new deputy saves the department on payroll costs, Mr. Dillon says. &quot;She works real cheap.&quot;    Not all of the county's residents are warm on the idea. &quot;Everybody here thinks it's kind of a joke,&quot; says Fred Leichty, production manager at Iowa Feeds in Washington, Iowa.    Mr. Dillon concedes that the ruse works mainly on through traffic, not on locals who know what to watch out for. And even with through traffic, Deputy 92-0 may lose her effectiveness as word spreads.    But the department can always tinker with the idea if speeders catch on. &quot;We can put two 'people' in the car, or add a radar operator,&quot; says Mr. Dillon. &quot;Our imagination is the only thing that restricts us.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
