DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An investor group says it had bought a 6.24percent stake in Harley-Davidson Inc., the motorcycle manufacturerthat used protective tariffs in the early 1980s to beat backJapanese competition.   In a filing Monday with the Securities and Exchange Commission,Malcolm I. Glazer, a Rochester, N.Y, investor and businessman, saidhe had purchased 488,200 shares, or 5.7 percent of Harley's commonstock.   The filing also stated that Glazer's six children _ Avram,Bryan, Darcie, Edward, Joel and Kevin Glazer _ each controlled8,500 shares of Harley for a family total of 6.24 percent.   Glazer last year acquired 9.9 percent in the Formica Corp. at$12 a share and was rebuffed in a $20-a-share buyout offer beforethe laminated products company went private in a management-leddeal for $19 a share.   ``We invest in companies which we feel are significantlyundervalued, are leaders in their field, have strong brand namerecognition and exhibit tremendous future growth potential,''Glazer said in a statement. ``Harley- Davidson fits all thesecategories.''   Glazer is chairman of First Allied Corp., which he said hasinterests in more than 30 companies in 12 states, includingnetwork-affiliated television stations, real estate, health careand banking, with assets of more than $200 million.   First Allied in 1984 offered $7.6 billion to buy ConsolidatedRail Corp., or Conrail, Glazer said.   The SEC filing on Harley said the Glazer group had ``nodefinitive plans at this time'' for their shares but ``arecurrently evaluating their respective positions.''   The filing, however, said they may seek to acquire a controllinginterest or sell off all or part of their shares.   Harley stock fell 50 cents to $39.12{ in New York Stock Exchangetrading Monday.   Milwaukee-based Harley, the producer of big, distinctivemotorcycles featured in such movies as ``Easy Rider'' and favoredby many law enforcement agencies, is the only U.S.-based motorcyclemanufacturer.   The Reagan administration in 1983 imposed five years of stifftariffs against imported motorcycles that had been beating Harley'sown product. The tariffs were removed in 1987 after the companyannounced it no longer needed the protection.   ``In the early '80s, the company was being badly beaten by theJapanese,'' Glazer said. ``Today, however, the Harley factory can'tproduce enough motorcycles to meet the overwhelming consumerdemand.''   Harley reported second-quarter profits of $10.9 million, or$1.26 a share, on sales of $234 million.   The filing listed the occupation of Darcie and Edward Glazer asstudents while their brothers were listed as ``assistant to MalcolmI. Glazer.''   The filing said Malcolm Glazer personally purchased 409,800shares for $13.7 million _ $3.47 million of it from his personalfunds. Another $376,000 was obtained through a loan from ChemicalBank that has since been paid.   The rest of the money to buy the stock, $10.3 million, ``isexpected to be obtained through a combination of Mr. Glazer'spersonal funds and a loan or loans from Chemical'' under termssimilar to the previous promissory note Glazer signed.   The younger Glazers bought their shares for totals ranging from$234,572 to $235,697, all financed by loans from Chemical,according to the filing.   The three companies purchased the remainder of the stock througha combination of working capital and Chemical loans.</TEXT></DOC>
