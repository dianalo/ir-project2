Adopted 98-1, the measure would give Congress a veto overany transfer of captured Iraqi war materiel in the Mideastand imposes new reporting requirements on the White Houseregarding the future U.S. military presence in the region.Arms sales would be barred to any nation that fails tofulfill its pledges to help pay for the war. And in hisstrongest language to date, Senate Appropriations CommitteeChairman Robert Byrd chastised Gulf allies for not fulfillingtheir commitments more quickly.</LP><TEXT>   In a behind-the-scenes lobbying campaign, President Bushand Secretary of State James Baker appeared to be successfulin preventing deep cuts in aid to Jordan, but theadministration suffered repeated losses on domesticamendments to a companion $5.24 billion spending measure.   On a 52-48 roll call, the Senate rejected a bid toreallocate funds to tenant ownership and shelter programsbacked by Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp.And by a 60-40 margin, dairy interests revamped federalmarketing orders to shore up falling beverage milk prices andgive farmers an additional 26 cents a gallon. Proponentsargued the added cost to consumers would be only five to 10cents a gallon. But the action met strong opposition frommill processing companies and the ranking Republican on theSenate Budget Committee, Sen. Pete Domenici, who said theburden would fall mostly on poor families.   Though still hopeful that most of the costs of the warwill be met by foreign contributions, the Pentagon estimatedlast night that only about $21 billion so far has beenreceived in cash or in-kind services. An additional $6billion is in transit from Japan, but the administration isstill relying on $15 billion from the U.S. Treasury to serveas a bridge loan in the interim.   Mr. Byrd's dominant role is enhanced by his close workingrelationship with Budget Director Richard Darman. And theadministration has lent its tacit support, in turn, tohome-state projects sought by the West Virginia Democrat. Ayear ago, on a comparable supplemental bill, Mr. Byrd added$185 million for a Federal Bureau of Investigationfingerprint facility in his state, and he was instrumentallast October in attaching a provision to the classifiedfiscal 1991 budget of the Central Intelligence Agency tofacilitate a search for a new CIA office compound in northernVirginia or West Virginia.   Government officials familiar with the CIA budget saidthen that an estimated $2 million was made available at Mr.Byrd's request, but the chairman's office repeatedly deniedany connection to a possible CIA building project until theagency began searching for sites recently.   By contrast, House Appropriations Committee Chairman JamieWhitten found himself the butt of Vice President Dan Quayle'scampaign jokes last fall in favor of term limitations. In ajibe back at Mr. Quayle, Whitten loyalists in the House areblocking a provision sought by the administration forextended authority to spend $330,000 to repair and renovatethe vice president's official residence.   If not fully spent this fiscal year, the money must bereappropriated. But the House bill refuses any extension.&quot;This project should be completed expeditiously,&quot; theaccompanying legislative report says, with mock concern. &quot;Theinconvenience to the family caused by the drawn-outrehabilitation period is not desirable or acceptable.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
