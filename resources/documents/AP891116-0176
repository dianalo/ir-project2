Hanna Khader, 54, a former hotel manager from Israeli-annexedeast Jerusalem, was recovering in stable condition in the intensivecare ward at Hadassah medical center, Khader's family said.   ``God, I don't really know what to say,'' said his daughter,Jamilla. ``We thank the family that agreed to give the heart to ahuman being without looking if he were an Arab or a Jew.''   Khader's wife, Mary, said: ``I can't tell you how happy I am.He's a human being and there is no difference between a Palestinianand an Israeli in such cases.''   Jamilla told Israel radio the family learned from the media thather father's heart donor was a slain Israeli soldier.   She indicated her family had some concern that they could betargeted by Palestinian or Islamic radicals for accepting anIsraeli's heart, but said ``in such cases we cannot mix politicswith medicine.''   ``I hope that the events (in the occupied territories) will endand everything will return to normal,'' she added.   The heart was removed from Sgt. Zeev Traum, 40, after he diedWednesday night of a head wound suffered after Palestinianguerrillas raked his patrol jeep with at least 28 rounds ofautomatic gunfire in an ambush Monday, Israel radio said. A secondsoldier also was killed.   Traum, an army reservist and father of four, was the 42ndIsraeli to die in the violence of the 23-month uprising againstIsraeli rule. At least 615 Palestinians have been killed by Israelitroops or civilians in the bloodshed. Another 146 Palestinians havebeen slain by others who accused them of collaborating with Israeliauthorities.   In an interview with Israel television that broke a day ofsilence, Brenda Traum refused comment when asked whether she agreedto the doctor's request to transplant her husband's heart into thebody of an Arab.   She did say, however, that she believed her husband would haveagreed to donate an organ if it could save a life.   ``If it is possible to save a person I think it is a religiouscommandment,'' she said, speaking from her home in Yodfat, acollective farm where Traum raised flowers for export.   ``Zeev was a man who helped people as a natural matter ofcourse, without being asked,'' she said. ``We spoke abouttransplants a bit and he said it was a good thing.''   Hadassah hospital took the unusual step of asking doctors andspokesmen not to comment on the transplant, Israel radio said,apparently because of the operation's sensitive political nature.   Azai Applebaum, the director of cardiology, broke the silenceThursday night and appeared on television.   ``We treat the sick and we have never looked at nationality oridentity,'' he said. ``I don't think that this point hassignificance in an operation like this.''   Israel radio said Traum's condition began deteriorating rapidlyTuesday night and doctors asked the family to agree to donate hisheart to one of dozens of Israelis and Arabs waiting for atransplant.   The family agreed and Khader was chosen as a recipient becausehis body tissue closely matched that of Traum.   The heart was flown in a special ice chest by militaryhelicopter from Soroka hospital in Beer Sheva to Jerusalem'sHadassah hospital at midnight Wednesday night and the 4-hourtransplant was immediately performed.   It was the ninth heart transplant performed in Israel but thefirst known case since the uprising began of an Israeli donating anorgan to a Palestinian.   In December, the family of a Palestinian family shot to death byan Israeli soldier in the West Bank town of Nablus refused todonate their son's heart to an Israeli civilian.   The Palestinian, Nasr Hawwash, 20, was declared brain dead aftersustaining a serious head wound Dec. 16. during a demonstration.   The Israeli, Yehiel Israeli, 46, had been hooked to a respiratorsince Dec. 18 after unsuccessful surgery on a heart valve. He diedthree days later.</TEXT></DOC>
