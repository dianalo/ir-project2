The first lecture is devoted to some general aspects ofconformal invariance and duality. The second sketches methods for carryingout perturbative calculations in string field theory. The final lecturepresents an alternative lattice approach to a nonperturbative formulationof the sum over world surfaces. 35 refs., 12 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
