It assigned a single-A-minus rating to the holding company's $75 million of subordinated capital notes due 1999. The rating concern said that although Comerica's profitability is improving, it &quot;continues to lag behind its peers, as substantial provisions for loan losses are needed to offset high consumer loan losses.&quot; A spokesman said the company is disappointed by the downgradings but is optimistic about its earnings outlook. &quot;We see our relative position vis-a-vis our peers as continuing to improve,&quot; he said, citing the company's record profit in the first quarter, its sixth consecutive quarter of improved earnings.    ---   DIAMOND SHAMROCK CORP. -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. lowered ratings on senior debt of this Dallas-based energy and chemical company to Baa-3 from Baa-2 and on commercial paper to Prime-3 from Prime-2. About $1.28 billion of securities is affected. The rating concern cited increased leverage and higher fixed charges -- including dividends on its newly issued preferred -- resulting from a restructuring. Moody's also said it expects conditions in the oil market to put pressure on Diamond Shamrock's earnings and cash flow. In the long term, however, the company should benefit from the new strategy, cost reductions and consolidations undertaken by its new management, Moody's said. Diamond Shamrock officials couldn't be reached for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
