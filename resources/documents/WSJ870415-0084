Yesterday, Atlanta-based Contel asked to meet soon with Comsat executives to discuss a mutually acceptable plan for terminating the agreement. The transaction, proposed in September, would have an indicated value of $2.47 billion.    Washington-based Comsat didn't indicate its attitude about the possible collapse of the merger. But a company spokesman said the meeting with Contel officials would happen &quot;as soon as possible.&quot;    In a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Contel said it wanted to withdraw because of recent actions by the Federal Communications Commission that would make Comsat's business less attractive.    Earlier this month, the FCC ordered Comsat, which provides transatlantic communications for international and maritime customers, to refund $62 million of &quot;excess earnings.&quot; The agency said Comsat earned more than its authorized aftertax profit margin of 12.48% between 1983 and 1986.    The FCC also found that certain Comsat cost allocations were faulty, and it ordered Comsat to recalculate its rates to correct the allocations. Comsat has 45 days to file a schedule of refunds for revenue associated with the excess earnings or to demonstate why it shouldn't have to make the refunds.    In its letter to the SEC, Contel cited three other actions proposed by the FCC that would dim Comsat's allure. The first proposal would do away with the requirement that half of all overseas calls from the U.S. be transmitted by Intelsat, the international communications network in which the U.S. is represented by Comsat. The second would deny Comsat's request to represent the U.S. on Inmarsat, the maritime equivalent of Intelsat, instead giving all carriers direct access to the network. The third could open the way for greater use of fiber optics -- and therefore less need for satellites -- in telecommunications across the North Atlantic.    &quot;In view of the foregoing matters,&quot; the letter says, &quot;Contel believes it would be in the best interests of Comsat, Contel and the respective shareholders of both companies if the agreement were terminated by mutual consent.&quot;    Wall Street analysts contend that the FCC orders could damage Comsat's present balance sheet and reduce future earnings. &quot;Comsat no longer is as attractive to Contel as it was at first. The risks have changed,&quot; said Joel D. Gross, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. &quot;Contel was looking at Comsat to contribute to earnings. The FCC order changes that. I think it's a dead deal.&quot;    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Comsat closed at $27, down $3.125, while Contel closed at $30.25, up 12.5 cents.    Comsat has argued that FCC orders are &quot;unwarranted.&quot; The company said it doesn't believe its &quot;exposure ultimately will be anywhere near the $62 million.&quot;    Furthermore, Comsat contends that any refund would be &quot;prospective, as a redirection in future rates, rather than a retroactive adjustment of past earnings.&quot;    Comsat officials declined to discuss whether they will try to persuade Contel to keep the agreement alive. The transaction was expected to be completed early this summer, assuming approval by the FCC and various state regulators.    But Contel has concluded that the new issues raised by the FCC are still likely to be pending then.    Terms of the merger agreement called for the combined companies to retain the name and identity of Comsat while giving operating control to Contel's leaders.    Contel is by far the larger of the two concerns. For 1986, it reported earnings of $232.9 million, or $3.04 a share, on revenue of $3.07 billion. Comsat had 1986 earnings of $58.9 million, or $3.22 a share, on revenue of $466.3 million.    Industry analysts had viewed Comsat's willingness to merge with Contel as a way to seek a safe harbor from the intense competition that recent deregulation has fueled. Contel also was seen as a potential source for strengthening Comsat's marketing and cash flow. </TEXT></DOC>
