On the New York Mercantile Exchange, a sensitive barometer ofprice trends, traders remained wary Friday of guessing results ofthe meeting of Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countriesministers in Vienna, Austria.   The ministers were trying to develop a strategy to jointlyreduce output with eight non-OPEC producers in order to eraseexcess supplies from the market.   Contracts for June delivery of West Texas Intermediate, thebenchmark U.S. crude, closed 1 cent higher at $17.99 per 42-gallonbarrel Friday, after having been down as much as 43 cents.   Among refined products, wholesale unleaded gasoline fell 0.16cent per gallon to 51.67 cents, and wholesale heating oil rose 0.82cent a gallon to 51.79 cents.   James Steel, a strategist at the Refco Inc. commodities firm,said oil prices dropped sharply early in the session because ofwhat he called carryover selling from Thursday over the lack ofsignificant news from the OPEC meeting.   After prices fell so quickly, some traders saw buyingopportunities and the market quickly moved up. That prompted othertraders who had sold borrowed oil on the hunch prices would fall tobuy it back, a price-boosting influence known as short-covering.   Donald Morton, an analyst at the Boston office ofPrudential-Bache Securities, Inc., called the late-sessionbounceback a ``pre-weekend, short-covering rally.''</TEXT></DOC>
