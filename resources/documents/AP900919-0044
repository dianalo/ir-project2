At least 82 people were hurt,officials said.   Dozens of men, women and children jumped into the cold St.Lawrence River on Tuesday to escape the stinging gas.   Mohawks punched and kicked soldiers, who used rifle butts andfists in the brawl after the Indians intervened during thesearch-and-seizure operation at the Kahnawake reservation by themilitary and Quebec provincial police.   It was one of the most violent clashes since the Mohawk standoffbegan more than two months ago over plans by the city of Oka, 18miles west of Montreal, to build a golf course extension on whatthe Indians say is tribal land.   The federal government has since bought the disputed land in anattempt o settle the quarrel, but some Mohawk activists have heldout for settlement of other grievances including demands forgreater sovereignty.   Eight helicopters and about 100 troops took part in the raid onTekakwitha Island.   Maj. Rusty Bassarab, a military spokesman, said the raid nettedabout 50 weapons, ranging from shotguns and handguns to huntingrifles and AK-47 assault rifles. The weapons, wrapped in plastic,were found under rocks in the forest and were taken out byhelicopter.   But Mohawks struck back. One soldier was dragged to the ground,punched, kicked and struck repeatedly on the head with his ownhelmet.   Bassarab said between five and seven soldiers were injured bythe Mohawks.   The soldiers fired several volleys of submachine-gun fire intothe air and then shot tear gas point-blank into the crowd, forcingthem back. Dozens of people jumped into the river to evade thefumes.   About 75 people, including several children, were treated at thenearby Kateri Memorial Hospital for tear gas and released.   Dr. Louis Montour, medical director of the hospital, said a15-year-old girl with a possible fractured hip and a 24-year-oldman with a possible fractured knee were sent to Montreal GeneralHospital by ambulance.   The clash at the reserve on the south shore of the St. LawrenceRiver shifted attention away from Kahnesatake, near Oka, where themilitary has surrounded about 50 Mohawks in a drug and alcoholtreatment center.   Mike Myers, an American chief who is trying to reach asettlement in the Oka standoff, said Tuesday night that the battlein Kahnawake ``is certainly toughening the attitude of the MohawksIn Kahnesatake.''   The Mohawks had erected barricades in front of approaches to theMercier Bridge, a major commuter link to Montreal, after the July11 botched provincial police raid on an Indian roadblock at theMohawk settlement in Kahnesatake.   A police officer was killed in the July assault, which waslaunched to enforce a court order that the Oka roadblock bedismantled.   Troops dismantled the Oka roadblock after the Mercier Bridgebarricades were removed by troops and Mohawks late last month.</TEXT></DOC>
