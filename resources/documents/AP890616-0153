Fridaybecause the company allegedly failed to promptly inform the agencyit was manufacturing a new chemical substance.   Such notification is required under federal toxic substancescontrol laws. The law provides a civil penalty of up to $25,000 foreach day the notification provision is violated.   The EPA said Dow, based in Midland, Mich., accumulated 227separate violations because of the reporting lapses involving thenew chemical product, a clear plastic called polycarbonate.   The company has 20 days to request a formal hearing on theproposed penalties.   Bill Donberg, Dow's business director for polycarbonates, saidthe product has been manufactured by Dow in Freeport, Texas, since1985. He said Dow determined no EPA notification was requiredbecause some of the chemicals used in the product already were onthe EPA's list of toxic substances.   Donberg said the company gave the EPA notification in 1987.   ``What we're going to have to do is explore with the EPA to seewhether or not we did actually commit this violation and if we did,what the appropriate penalty would be,'' Donberg said.</TEXT></DOC>
