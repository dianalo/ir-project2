The demand in each demand subinterval issummed with the demands from the N-1 most recent continguous demand subintervalsto derive the interval demand. The interval demand is compared with aprior stored maximum demand to decide whether to discard the presentinterval demand or to use it to replace the previously recorded maximumdemand. Demand is accumulated in terms of actual power usage by scalingpower usage pulses according to the relationships in the particular meteron which the rolling demand register is used. Thresholds are providedfor producing warning signals to alert the consumer to an actual of impendingdemand condition which may adversely affect billing.</TEXT></DOC>
