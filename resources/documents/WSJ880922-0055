But trading once again was light.    Gold sank below $400 an ounce for the first time in more than a year and a half. Treasury bonds responded by climbing about 1/4 of a point, or $2.50 for each $1,000 face amount. The latest 30-year government bonds yielded 9.01% late yesterday, down from 9.04% Tuesday.    Municipal, corporate and mortgage-backed bond prices also rose slightly in lackluster activity.    Inflation and economic news released by the government yesterday morning contained few surprises and thus produced hardly any reaction. Trading had been expected to be light because many people took the day off in observance of Yom Kippur.    Still, some analysts were surprised that the gold price slump didn't produce a much larger bond rally. One explanation offered by traders is that inflation fears remain deeply rooted, especially because of widespread expectations that employment statistics to be released Oct. 7 will show faster economic growth in September. If so, the Federal Reserve might tighten credit further, driving up interest rates.    &quot;Skepticism is the mood of the market,&quot; said Robert T. Falconer, a senior vice president at CRT Government Securities Ltd. &quot;People are waiting for confirmation that the August readings suggesting a slowing in the economy will be sustained by data coming with the September labor market report.&quot;    Moreover, some traders are apprehensive about a government report due Friday on durable goods orders for August. It's expected to show an increase of about 1%, which would represent a sharp turnaround from July's decline of 7.1%.    The durable goods figures are exceptionally volatile from month to month and many economists warn against focusing on single-month moves. Nevertheless, the figures often produce sharp swings in bond prices.    In addition, a large volume of government borrowing will hit the credit markets over the next week. The Treasury announced plans to sell $15.75 billion of notes next week, consisting of $8.75 billion of two-year notes to be auctioned Tuesday and $7 billion of four-year notes to be sold the following day.    Treasury Securities   Although Treasury bonds rallied, they finished the session only slightly higher than their lows of the day.    Among benchmark issues, the government's latest 30-year bonds rose 9/32 of a point, the same gain as Tuesday, to a price of 101 5/32. The government's latest 10-year notes rose 5/32 of a point to 102 6/32. The yield fell to 8.91% from 8.93%.    Shearson Lehman Hutton's index of long-term Treasury bonds rose 2.99 points to 1242.77. The low was 1241.09 and the high was 1247.08.    Among short-term issues, the rate on the latest three-month Treasury bill dipped to 7.18% bid from 7.19% Tuesday. The latest six-month bill rate was quoted late in the day at 7.36% bid, unchanged from Tuesday.    The Treasury said yesterday it will sell new two-year and four-year notes next week. The sales will enable the department to pay down about $1.73 billion on the federal debt. The notes to be sold total $15.75 billion, while maturing two-year and four-year notes total $17.47 billion.    The $8.75 billion of two-year notes to be sold next Tuesday were quoted late yesterday in when-issued trading at 8.39%. The $7 billion of four-year notes, to be sold next Wednesday, were quoted late yesterday at 8.59%.    The two-year notes will be dated Sept. 30 and will mature Sept. 30, 1990. The four-year notes will also be dated Sept. 30 and will mature Sept. 30, 1992.    The two-year notes will be available in minimum denominations of $5,000, and the four-year notes will be sold in minimum lots of $1,000. Tenders for the notes must be received by 1 p.m. EDT on the day of the sale at the Treasury or at Federal Reserve banks or branches.    Corporate Issues   Corporates bonds were little changed to up 1/8 point in light late trading.    The junk bond market came alive with the sale of $1.07 billion of securities by Duracell Holdings Corp., one of the summer's larger junk bond financings.    The financing was sold in two parts: $400 million of 12-year senior subordinated debentures priced as a 13 1/2 issue at par and $670 million (redemption amount) of senior subordinated discount notes priced at a steep discount of $522.80 per $1,000 security.    The discount bonds will be zero coupon securities and pay no interest for the first five years. Thereafter, they will pay interest semi-annually at a rate of 13 1/8%.    Duracell was purchased for $1.8 billion from Kraft Inc. earlier this year in a leveraged buyout organized by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. Proceeds from the debt offering will be used to repay $525 million of bridge loans made in connection with the transaction.    Another large new issue is targeted for pricing today. The $4.82 billion (redemption amount) issue of certificates that will refinance some military loans made to Israel by the U.S. has been meeting with such strong demand that it may affect how underwriters price the offering's four tranches.    For example, the $3.614 billion redemption amount of zero-coupon certificates slated for sale is now expected to be priced at a spread of 23 to 25 basis points above the yield curve for Treasury &quot;strip&quot; zero-coupon securities. The expectation had been for a rate 25 to 28 basis points over Treasury strips.    Among other portions of the deal:   --$108.6 million of certificates due 1995 and with an average life of 5.4 years are expected to be priced 28 to 30 basis points above the rate of the Treasury five-year note. The expectation had been for a rate 30 to 35 basis points over Treasuries.    --$100 million of certificates due 1996 with an average life of 7.2 years are now expected to be priced 38 to 40 basis points above the rate of the Treasury seven-year note. The expectation had been for a rate 39 to 44 basis points over Treasuries.    --$1 billion of certificates due in 2002 with an average life of 10.7 years are now expected to be priced at a spread of 42 to 46 basis points above the rate of the Treasury 10-year note. They had been expected to come out at a rate 42 to 47 basis points over Treasuries.    Municipal Issues   Municipal bond prices were flat to slightly higher in light trading.    Today, the Securities and Exchange Commission plans to release its long-awaited staff report on the Washington Public Power Supply System's $2.25 billion municipal bond default in 1983. The SEC also will consider proposing a rule to enhance disclosure in the municipal market, a change that many participants have been urging for years.    It should come as no surprise if the WPPSS report is critical of various market participants. But people familiar with the situation have been saying for months that the commission decided some time ago not to take any enforcement action against underwriters or others connected with the offerings.    Mortgage-Backed Securities   Prices of Ginnie Mae securities closed about 1/8 point higher in light trading.    Among active pass-through securities, the October Ginnie Mae 10% issue was quoted late in the session at 100 14/32, up 1/8, while Ginnie Mae's 11% issue was at 105 6/32, also up 1/8.    The 10% Ginnie Mae issue was yielding 10.085% to a 12-year average life assumption, as the spread above the 10-year was about 117 basis points.    Meanwhile, the securitizing of consumer receivables saw a new application this week when an Atlanta-based company used some of its receivables to back commercial paper floated to finance a portion of the firm's $242.4 million leveraged buyout.    The financing allowed Rhodes Inc., a furniture retailer, to save about 200 basis points in financing costs compared with more typical bank borrowings, according to Richard Mitchell, chief financial officer of Rhodes.    What made the savings possible was a guarantee that interest and principal would be paid in full issued by Capital Markets Assurance Corp., a Citicorp unit that insures asset-backed transactions. That guarantee places a triple-A rating on the transaction.    C. Thomas Meyers, senior vice president of Capital Markets Assurance, said the commercial paper is overcollateralized by about 17 1/2%. That amount rises to 25% in two years.    Mr. Meyers said the collateral will be monitored and adjusted monthly. He said that if the amount of receivables declines, the amount of commercial paper outstanding will also decline.    About $124 million of commercial paper was floated in connection with the leveraged buyout. Rhodes' Mr. Mitchell said the commercial paper was sold at a rate of about 8 1/2%. He said the total effective cost to the company is about 9.5%, roughly 200 basis points lower than what the company would have paid if it borrowed from a bank instead.    Mr. Meyers of Capital Markets Assurance said similar leveraged buyout-related financings are in the works, including a five-year security that will be backed by credit card receivables.    Foreign Bonds   After soaring Tuesday, British government bond prices drifted slightly lower yesterday in thin activity.    Tuesday's strong rally in British government issues, known as gilts, was sparked by news of an easing in U.K. lending growth. Now, traders say they are beginning to focus on August U.K. trade data to be released next week.    Last month, the gilt market was stunned by news that the July trade deficit unexpectedly widened to 2.2 billion pounds from 1 billion pounds in June. Early market forecasts are for an August current account deficit of about 1.5 billion pounds and a trade deficit of about 2 billion pounds.    The benchmark Treasury 11 3/4% issue due 2003/2007 declined 5/32 of a point to 114 7/32 to yield 9.87%. On Tuesday, the issue jumped more than a point.    Among shorter-term gilts, the Treasury's 11 3/4% issue due 1991 dipped 2/32 point to 102 8/32 to yield 10.58%, while the Treasury's 12% issue due 1995 declined 2/ 32 to 107 2/32 to yield 10.43%.    In Tokyo, Japanese government bond prices closed at their session highs in moderate activity. The benchmark No. 105, 5% issue due 1997 closed at 99.56, up 0.60 yen per 100 yen face value. The yield fell to 5.07%, down 9.5 basis points on the day. (A basis point is one one-hundredth of a percentage point.) The range was 5.07% to 5.165%. Volume was moderate.    The auction for the October issue of 10-year bonds is expected to be held in the first half of next week. The issue is likely to be between 500 billion and 800 billion yen, with a 5% coupon, priced at 98 to 98.50. Dealers fear slow initial sales.    Separately, West German government bonds rose. But a large new World Bank issue totaling 500 million marks pushed Euromark bond prices down slightly.    The West German government's benchmark 6 3/4% issue due 1998 ended the day 0.20 point higher at 101.10 to yield 6.592%. On the Euromark side, Electricite de France's 6 1/8% issue of 1998 were quoted at 98.70 bid, down 0.10, to yield 6.36%. </TEXT></DOC>
