Maps of (C-12)O emission in the J = 1-0 and J = 2-1lines were compared with observations of the (C-13)O, CH, and OH molecules.The peak emission in the (C-12)O transitions does not occur in the directionof the continuum sources, and thus, an incomplete picture arises whenonly one line of sight in the two clouds is analyzed. The cloud toward3C 154 appears to have a low extinction, but a relatively high CO abundance,suggesting that it is similar to high-latitude clouds and CO-rich diffuseclouds. The cloud toward 3C 353 is considerably denser than that toward3C 154 and may be more like a dark cloud. 32 references.</TEXT></DOC>
