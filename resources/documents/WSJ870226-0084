ApcarStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 02/26/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> GOVMTBANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK) </IN><DATELINE> DALLAS  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Thrift regulators in the Southwest are launching a program designed to place as much as $3 billion in deposits into about 100 weak savings and loan associations who are desperate for funds.    The program being unveiled by the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas this week would try to funnel excess cash held by about 300 of the region's healthier institutions into Sandamp;Ls in Texas, Arkansas, New Mexico, Mississippi and Louisiana. The weakest thrifts are paying as much as 1.25 percentage points more for deposits than thrifts in other parts of the country, regulators say, and that higher cost is slashing their net worth, or assets minus liabilities, and putting many thrifts into the red.    The goal of the program is to try to reduce the funding costs for the weaker Sandamp;Ls and wean them away from relying on more costly funds from so-called hot-money market brokers. If it works, says Roy G. Green, president of the Dallas Home Loan Bank, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board has given approval to the Dallas bank to seek depositors nationally to aid the troubled thrifts in the Southwest. Then, the other 11 Federal Home Loan Banks would serve as agents to direct the funds from highly liquid thrifts to the ailing institutions in the Southwest.    The program is generally being well-received but it's too early to tell whether it will manage to chip away at the huge premium some Sandamp;Ls in the Southwest, especially Texas, are paying to attract deposits. Some Texas thrifts are offering interest rates on 90-day deposits as high as 7%, while the national average is 5.75%. Thrifts in Texas that are struggling to maintain liquidity are paying the higher rates because depositors are shying away from Texas institutions, which have been hurt by the slumping state economy and fears of more thrift and bank failures.    The Dallas Home Loan Bank is offering to broker the deposits among thrifts in its five-state district in insured amounts of as much as $100,000 in 90-day certificates of deposit. It will pay a 1/4 percentage point above the 6.5% London interbank offered rates, known as Libor, for three-month deposits.    Thrifts in the Southwest are reeling from a decline in energy prices and the collapse of real estate values as the recession in Texas and other energy states continues to run broad and deep. Regulators fear that hundreds of thrifts in the five-state region are insolvent or nearly so, and if regulators were to close them the ultimate cost would be borne by the better-off institutions who contribute to the Federal Savings and Loan Deposit Insurance Corp., the federal agency that insures thrift deposits and liquidates closed Sandamp;Ls.    &quot;The problem is very severe,&quot; says Richard K. Kneipper, a Dallas attorney who represents several banks and thrifts. The Dallas bank's program, he says, is &quot;a welcome and unusually creative solution.&quot; John Scaramozi, executive vice president at San Antonio Savings Association, says his thrift would participate, &quot;if it made economic sense.&quot; So far, he says, he doesn't know all the details. As for the 6.75% rate being offered, he says, &quot;It is in the ballpark.&quot;    George M. Barclay, executive vice president of the Dallas bank, estimates that as many as 300 Sandamp;Ls in the bank's five-state area would be eligible to put deposits into 100 troubled thrifts. He says it is difficult to calculate how much excess funds the healthier institutions have, but one indication is that many of those institutions already have about $4.3 billion on deposit at the Dallas bank earning about 6%. If some of that money can be diverted, he says, the depositing institution will earn a higher rate and the Sandamp;L receiving the funds for 90 days will pay less for the deposit than it is currently paying.    Whether the program will shave the &quot;Texas premium&quot; some thrifts are paying for funds is debatable, money brokers say. &quot;It depends on how much money they put in there,&quot; says James Chaffee, president of Professional Asset Securities Inc., a Solana Beach, Calif., money broker. Mr. Barclay says he doubts the program will cut the premium much. &quot;We should have an impact on a selected institution,&quot; Mr. Barclay says, &quot;but we will not really impact the funding structure of the U.S.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
