But the question of who will be Japan's next prime minister wasthrown into confusion as the top contender, former Foreign MinisterMasayoshi Ito, said he would decline any offer to succeed Takeshita.   An advisory board to the the prime minister today recommended anoverhaul of regulations governing politicians' fund-raising toavoid the conflict of interest and influence-peddling that havedogged Takeshita's administration.   Takeshita pledged Tuesday to resign after the budget's passageto take responsibility for the Recruit Co. stock-profiteering andbribery scandal, which has buffeted his administration for 10months.   The Budget Committee of the House of Representatives, Japan'spowerful lower house, took just one minute to approve the budget.The session was boycotted by opposition party members.   Japanese lawmakers like to operate by consensus so the boycottwas seen as more than just symbolic.   Takeshita's Liberal Democratic Party was expected to force thebudget through Parliament on Friday, again in the absence of theopposition, which is demanding new parliamentary elections and thatformer Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone be summoned to testifyabout his role in the scandal.   There still was no clear successor to Takeshita, as many seniorLiberal Democratic leaders are linked to the scandal.   Ito, widely viewed as the top candidate for interim premier,said today that he would not serve due to poor health. Ito, 76, hasheart problems caused by diabetes.   Takeshita met Wednesday with Shintaro Abe, secretary general ofthe governing party, and the two agreed to decide after a holidayweek that ends May 6 on a new party president, who willautomatically become prime minister.   Ito told reporters that Masaharu Gotoda, an ex-chief of thenational police who served as the top Cabinet aide to Nakasone,might be an appropriate choice. Gotoda, 76, now heads an ethicspanel appointed by Takeshita and comprised of members of thegoverning party.   Another blue-ribbon panel made up of prominent members of theprivate and academic sectors today recommended a series of reforms,including requiring all members of Parliament to make public theirassets and banning them from trading in stocks or giving monetarygifts at funerals and weddings.   Currently only Cabinet members must divulge their assets. Thereare no restrictions on lawmakers or their staff speculating onstocks, and parliamentarians routinely spend huge sums on weddingand funeral offerings to their constituents.   Oppositionists blasted the Liberal Democrats' strong-arm tacticson the budget, complaining that Takeshita's impending resignationwas not enough to resolve the Recruit scandal.   The budgetary moves came a day after the suicide of a formerTakeshita aide who handled Takeshita's political funds.   Ihei Aoki, 58, who had served Takeshita since 1958, was founddead in his Tokyo apartment after he slashed his wrist and ankleand hanged himself.   It was in Aoki's name that stock dealings and a $384,000 loanfrom Recruit Co., the firm at the center of the scandal, werecarried out.   Aoki is among more than a dozen politicians and political aideswho bought shares of a subsidiary of Recruit, a giant businessservices conglomerate, before they were offered publicly, thusreaping huge profits. In all, more than 150 political, business andmedia figures purchased the shares.   The transactions, though not illegal, badly tarnished the imageof the governing party and Takeshita's admnistration. Three of hisCabinet ministers resigned when it was discovered they or theiraides had purchased the stocks or received sizable contributionsfrom Recruit.   A widely unpopular tax reform also forced through Parliament bythe Liberal Democrats earlier this year contributed to public andpolitical outcries against Takeshita, plunging his support rate tohistoric lows _ 3.9 percent according to one poll this month.</TEXT></DOC>
