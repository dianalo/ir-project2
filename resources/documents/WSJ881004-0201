This represents a 12.9% increase from 1986.    The figures are based on a survey of 370 in-house law departments at banking institutions, manufacturing concerns, hospitals and other companies throughout the U.S. A few Canadian companies also are included.    The increased salaries reflect a concerted effort on the part of corporations to keep compensation levels competitive with those of outside law firms, according to Ward Bower of Altman andamp; Weil, a law firm management-consulting group. &quot;The compensation gap between lawyers in corporations and those in law firms nationwide has started to close,&quot; Mr. Bower said. &quot;There's much less difference in salaries, and in some cases lawyers in corporations are doing better than those in law firms.&quot;    Attorneys at publicly held corporations did better than their counterparts in nonpublic companies, the survey showed. Chief legal officers at public corporations averaged $171,288 in salary. Those who received bonuses averaged an additional $73,375.    In public and nonpublic companies, salary compensation for senior attorneys below the top in-house position increased last year, according to the survey, although not as significantly as at the highest level. Average total compensation for deputy chief legal officers rose 10.5%, to $158,222. The figure for division general counsel increased 7.5% to $139,420.    Bonuses were awarded primarily to attorneys with management responsibilities. More than half of the attorneys in each of the three senior level positions received bonuses last year. But the number of nonmanagement attorneys receiving bonuses grew as well. According to Robert I. Weil of Altman andamp; Weil, 39% of these lawyers received bonuses, up from 25% five years ago.    The bonuses made a difference in the compensation level for nonmanagement attorneys. The average salary for those attorneys was $64,952, a 6.7% increase from 1986. When bonuses were included, the increase in compensation levels was 8.3%. </TEXT></DOC>
