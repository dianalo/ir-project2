The recurrent speculation: Inside, RJR Nabisco Inc. was trying to invent a miracle cigarette that would turn the anti-smoking tide.    The company finally ended the suspense Monday by announcing a cigarette it said would produce little smoke, no tar, no ashes and no smell. &quot;The world's cleanest cigarette,&quot; boasted Edward A. Horrigan Jr., RJR's vice chairman.    But while RJR may have cleared the technological hurdles, marketers have many doubts and questions about the product, which is scheduled to be test-marketed next year. Can RJR sell this hybrid as a mainstream cigarette? Can it promote the apparent health benefits of the new product without undercutting its other brands? Is smoking too far gone as a socially acceptable practice to be revived by a product with so many bells and whistles?    Beyond those problems, RJR faces a tough bunch of customers. Cigarette smokers -- especially those who are left -- are notoriously finnicky and staunchly brand-loyal. &quot;They're talking to died-in-the-wool cigarette smokers, and I can't believe it will be an easy sell,&quot; says Morgan Hunter, a former president of RJR's tobacco business who is now vice chairman of Marketing Corp. of America, which numbers Lorillard Inc. among its clients.    Moreover, while getting people to try the new cigarette isn't likely to be a problem, getting them to take it seriously is another matter. &quot;There is an aura of the ridiculous hanging over the smokeless cigarette,&quot; says John Lister, executive vice president of Lister Butler Inc., a New York-based design firm that has done work for Philip Morris Cos.' tobacco business. &quot;It's sort of like the exploding cigar -- people are waiting for the surprise.&quot;    A lot will depend on the cigarette itself. When Marketing Spectrum Inc., an Atlanta-based marketing and research firm, polled consumers on the idea of a smokeless cigarette for another tobacco company four years ago, &quot;there was tremendous interest, but there was also a tremendous gap with reality,&quot; recalls Leenie Ruben, the firm's president. The effort stalled because the firm couldn't deliver a product to meet the consumer expectations.    Taste, while extremely important, is just a part of what RJR must get right. Smoking is a complex psychological, emotional and mechanical process, &quot;a total activity,&quot; says Leo Shapiro, a Chicago-based marketing consultant. &quot;Smokers like taking out the cigarette, tapping it, playing with it, blowing smoke.&quot;    Thus, marketers contend, to become widely popular RJR's new cigarette must also have the right feel, take the right amount of time to light (some use this as a convenient stall for time) and produce the right thickness of exhaled smoke (to some, a security-inducing screen). RJR says the cigarette will give off some smoke, but only immediately after being lighted. Exhaled smoke will resemble normal cigarette smoke but will dissipate more quickly, and won't smell or contain many of the compounds some find so objectionable in regular cigarette smoke.    The cigarette's biggest promise, some marketers claim, is the potential for easing the social pressure and guilt many smokers suffer. Ms. Ruben, who says she is often forced to slip out of meetings to sneak a cigarette in the ladies' room, admits she is eager to try the RJR product. Although she isn't sure she would switch brands, she says she may use the new cigarette as a substitute in such uncomfortable situations. She believes it has potential to reduce some of the social stigma.    But will it? Some marketers argue that anti-smoking sentiments have less and less to do with such tangibles as sidestream smoke and odor. The stigma goes &quot;far beyond the smoke cloud,&quot; says Robert Rosner, executive director of the Smoking Policy Institute, an anti-smoking concern that helps companies to establish smoking restrictions. &quot;Smoking -- the very fact of a cigarette dangling from one's mouth -- is viewed as a breakdown in someone's self-discipline.&quot;    That's not to say that health doesn't remain an important issue. Greyhound Corp., which instituted a companywide smoking ban last year, says it won't consider exempting the new cigarette from the ban unless it is proved safe. &quot;At Greyhound, we won't have anything that is harmful to employees' health on the premise,&quot; says John W. Teets, the company's chief executive officer. &quot;No one has come out and said this is a healthy cigarette.&quot;    Therein, many marketers believe, lies the greatest rub for RJR. For if the new cigarette is indeed somewhat safer -- as marketers and analysts believe it might be -- that would be its biggest selling point. (Scientists say they don't know enough yet to judge whether it is safer.)    But even if it is, RJR can't say so without casting further doubt on all other cigarettes and courting potential liability trouble. &quot;The marketing key really,&quot; says one industry executive, &quot;is in the ability to communicate the benefits without running afoul of the law or putting the rest of the company out of business.&quot;    About the furthest RJR can go, many marketers contend, is to present the new product as the ultimate in low-tar cigarettes -- no-tar -- and then rely on smokers' wishful thinking to fill in the blanks. RJR maintains, not that the cigarette will be &quot;safe&quot; or even &quot;safer,&quot; but that it is designed in part to eliminate some of the ingredients that cause smokers concern.    Pitching the cigarette that way, however, poses further questions for RJR. One big one: how to avoid cannibalizing its own low-tar or ultra-low-tar cigarette brands, which already make up more than half of its business.    Another question is how to avoid making it seem like a cigarette for wimps. Mr. Lister, of Lister Butler, sees an analogy with the problems the beer industry has had in marketing low-alcohol beer. He believes RJR will have to aim the cigarette at intellectual types. &quot;Alternatively,&quot; he warns, &quot;it could be for a coward.&quot;    RJR faces a variety of additional challenges as well. For one thing, RJR says the new cigarette will be premium-priced. But some analysts and marketers wonder whether consumers will be willing to pay extra, considering that in the past year price increases and new taxes have driven the average price of a pack of cigarettes up more than a dime, to about $1.16.    In addition, it's not the high-priced, classy cigarettes that are posting gains these days. Some of the industry's biggest recent gainers (and there aren't many) are Philip Morris's hallmark Marlboro in what is known as the &quot;virile&quot; sector of the market, RJR's own &quot;Doral&quot; in the lower-priced &quot;savings&quot; sector, and Lorillard's menthol-flavored Newport, according to John C. Maxwell Jr., an analyst with Furman Selz Mager Dietz andamp; Birney Inc.    RJR declines to discuss how it plans to respond to these challenges. But at a news conference Monday, Richard Campe, president of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Development Co., did acknowledge that the company had begun testing the product on consumers and found their ratings of taste and satisfaction &quot;very encouraging.&quot;    One industry executive predicts part of the marketing strategy will involve pitting the product against some of Philip Morris's brands, a tactic that could help the pricing problem and avoid cannibalizing other brands made by RJR, whose strongholds have been the middle-of-the-road, blue-collar and rural sectors. The Philip Morris smoker -- of such brands as Virginia Slims and Benson andamp; Hedges -- &quot;is a more feminine, better educated, more urbane, more upscale than the typical RJR smoker,&quot; he says. &quot;This is a product that will be targeted at all those things.&quot;    ---                         Best-Selling Smokes   Market shares of the top 10 cigarette brands during thefirst half 1987 MAKER AND BRAND                    MARKET SHARE Philip Morris  Marlboro ......................... 23.4%  Benson andamp; Hedges ..................  4.0  Merit ............................  3.9 RJR Nabisco  Winston .......................... 11.4  Salem ............................  7.9  Camel*............................  4.3  Vantage ..........................  3.3 Brown andamp; Williamson  Kool* ............................. 5.7 Lorillard  Newport ........................... 4.2 American Brands  Pall Mall ......................... 3.1   *Includes filter and non-filter   Source: The Maxwell Report</TEXT></DOC>
