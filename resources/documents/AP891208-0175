Keating, whose lawsuit accuses thegovernment of illegally seizing his Lincoln Savings and LoanAssociation, Friday was postponed until January.   After spending the day listening to a Phoenix investor describedetails of what regulators called a land swap to siphon federallyinsured deposits out of Irvine, Calif.-based Lincoln, U.S. DistrictJudge Stanley Sporkin recessed a hearing in the case until Jan. 2.   Sporkin held open the possibility he might reconvene the hearingon short notice to allow Keating's attorneys to cross-examinefederal thrift regulators if an opening occurs on his docket duringthe next three weeks.   However, attorneys for both the government and Keating said theydo not expect the beleagured Phoenix millionaire to be called as awitness until Jan. 3 at the earliest.   Keating filed the suit last May, a month after the Federal HomeLoan Bank Board seized control of his Sandamp;L, alleging that it haslost up to $2.5 billion in federlly insured desposits.   Since then, the government has filed a $1.1 billion fraud andracketeering suit of its own against Keating and a federal grandjury in Los Angeles is weighing possible criminal charges againsthim.   A similar suit has been filed against Keating by several of anestimated 23,000 investors who bought junk bonds in Lincoln'sparent company, American Continental Corp. The bonds were renderedvirtually worthless when the holding company filed for courtprotection from creditors under the bankruptcy laws last April.   Last month Keating invoked a Fifth Amendment privilege againstself-incrimination in refusing to testify before the House BankingCommittee about the operation of Lincoln. His attorneys declinedthis week to comment on whether he would again decline to testifybefore Sporkin.   On Friday, the judge heard Phoenix businessman Phillip Gordondescribe a pair of transactions he conducted with Lincoln andAmerican Continental in January 1988 that enabled the thrift torecord a $4.4 million profit on the sale of 445 acres of desertland west of Phoenix.   Kevin O'Connell, deputy director of the Treasury Department'sOffice of Thrift Supervison, had testified Thursday that the dealwas a ``sham'' because Gordon and his associates had no ability tomake the $6 million purchase.   But as a result of the deal, O'Connell said, AmericanContinental, which is chaired by Keating, was able to siphon $1.8million out of Lincoln in the form of future tax liabilitiescollected on behalf of the government but never paid.   Gordon testified that he bought the desert land from Lincolnlast Jan. 29, making a down payment of $1.5 million and financingthe other $4.5 million through a non-recourse loan from the Sandamp;L.   A day earlier, Gordon said, his Sun Olive limited partnershiphad sold a 135-acre parcel it owned in west Phoenix to AmericanContinental for $4.2 million _ $1.5 million above the $2.7 millionthat he and his partners had paid for it 13 months earlier.   He said that he and American Continental officials had workedout the deal in a conversation days earlier even though land valuesin the Phoenix area were stagnant at the time.   ``At some point we had discussed that the money for the downpayment would be coming from the Sun Olive sale,'' Gordon said.   Regulators have cited the transaction as an example by whichLincoln used land swaps and straw purchasers to record hundreds ofmillions of dollars in phony real estate profits, enabling thethrift to attract some $4 billion in new federally insured depositsunder Keating's ownership.   Just through a tax-sharing agreement alone, American Continentalwas able to siphon off $94 million of those deposits in the form ofdeferred taxes never actually paid to the Internal Revenue Service,the government alleges.   The regulators have acknowledged they approved the tax-sharingaccord in 1986, but they claim that its nature was``misrepresented'' to them by American Continental and Lincolnofficials.   Under federal Sandamp;L laws, they said, a thrift and its holdingcompany can comingle current taxes owed by each but not deferredtaxes.</TEXT></DOC>
