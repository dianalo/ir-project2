Planners envisioned four office towers for Times Square, as a gateway to a rejuvenated 42nd Street. There would be a hotel. A trade mart and retail shops would draw pedestrians by day, and as many as eight restored, legitimate theaters would pack them in by night.    The project would use state authority to condemn 13 acres. Private developers, with hefty tax breaks, would acquire the land and do the building.    The project at first was hailed. Then, criticism set in -- from developers, politicians, drama critics and adult bookstore owners, among others. The plan stalled.    Now, thanks to possible investment interest by the Kennedy family, the project seems to be picking up steam again. But a funny thing has happened in the past six years.    Several blocks in the theater district, directly north of the project area, have been acquired by private developers, who are building or planning office towers. What once was an area of blight has become a hot turf for real estate speculation bordering a strip of pornography and crime.    Therefore, critics of the 42nd Street project assert, the state-sponsored redevelopment should be abandoned or should be scaled way down. &quot;It has lost its purpose as a public project,&quot; a developer close to the plan says.    The nearby area &quot;is exploding,&quot; adds Robert Brandt, a property owner whose land faces condemnation by the project. &quot;If the marketplace were allowed to function, (42nd Street) would take care of itself.&quot;    Project officials say that private enterprise had done nothing in the project area, between Broadway and Eighth Avenue, which is as blighted as ever. &quot;There hasn't been any land assemblage on the block for 50 years,&quot; says Carl Weisbrod, the state official who is president of the project. Without public help, &quot;Times Square is impervious to change,&quot; he adds.    Nevertheless, the dispute poses a hard question: Should government carry out massive public projects after economic conditions, and perhaps the very reasons for doing a project, have changed?    &quot;The project was designed around a snapshot of the economy&quot; in the early 1980s, acknowledges Richard Rosan, senior vice president of Silverstein Properties Inc., which would help develop the hotel in the 42nd Street plan. &quot;But land costs have changed. Everything has changed.&quot;    Nearby blocks have changed for the better. Times Square is shabby but hardly squalid. It has a porno theater, but two blocks away there is a first-run cinema. There is also a bank, and there are offices, fast-food shops and a cookie shop serving iced cappuccino.    But 42nd Street, though it remains one of the world's best-known thoroughfares, has been going downhill since the Depression. Last year, 2,415 crimes were reported there. The dominant trade is still pornography. And with half of New York's legitimate theaters empty, there is no incentive for private developers to convert 42nd Street movie houses to legitimate theaters.    The project aims to create enough profit through the planned office buildings to subsidize restoration of theaters and a general cleanup. Park Tower Realty Corp., which would build the office towers, would invest $100 million to help acquire the theater sites and to renovate the sprawling Times Square subway station.    Park Tower, a partner in the project with Prudential Life Insurance Co. of America, would get taxes fixed at favorable rates for 15 years. And Park Tower would be permitted to build taller towers than normal zoning allows.    But the project has been delayed by a combination of political opposition, lawsuits from property owners (the state has won 25 suits in a row) and problems with the project's investors.    Meanwhile, construction is under way on three sites in the theater district; there is demolition at five more and three other buildings are planned, according to Cushman andamp; Wakefield, a Manhattan broker.    &quot;Everybody thought there wouldn't be any development until the project started,&quot; says an aide to state senator Franz Leichter, a persistent critic. &quot;It was supposed to be the linchpin. Now it's the final piece of the puzzle. It's too big and too subsidized.&quot;    Sen. Leichter's aide and other critics say the project, has served its purpose without being built. City officials say that anticipation of the project has spurred growth that, in the eyes of critics, renders the project less necessary.    &quot;It's an Orwellian argument,&quot; says James Stuckey, head of Public Development Corp., the city agency co-sponsoring the project. &quot;When we started on 42nd Street, none of the other (plans for development nearby) were on the drawing board.&quot;    Developers, however, say they have been drawn to the area bordering the project by incentives in the zoning code and by the surge in Manhattan real estate, which has exhausted land in midtown. &quot;I don't think people are buying because of 42nd Street,&quot; says Bruce Eichner, who is developing a retail and office building at Broadway and 45th Street.    Mr. Eichner adds that &quot;people are counting on 42nd Street as a long-term anchor; to have it founder would send a negative signal.&quot;    However, some developers say Park Tower has such a big tax edge that it may inhibit unsubsidized projects being planned nearby.    Seymour Durst, a big New York developer, has been assembling a parcel at Seventh Avenue and 43rd Street, for 20 years, gradually upgrading it. Mr. Durst, however, says he has stopped planning for the site until he knows the outcome of the 42nd Street project.    &quot;We're concerned about whether we could compete with four million square feet of subsidized space,&quot; he says. The urban renewal project &quot;is holding up the natural development of the area.&quot;    Paul Milstein, who owns a parking lot in the project area, and who unsuccessfully bid to build the project's office towers, says he would develop his lot if the plan were scrapped.    A state judge, however, dismissed as &quot;sour grapes&quot; a lawsuit by Mr. Milstein aimed at halting the project. And supporters of the project say it would be unfair to give up on it now.    Park Tower, they note, was designated in open bidding. George Klein, its owner, has complied with all government requests, even agreeing to accept less favorable terms during renegotiations last year. And despite its tax breaks, the project would produce substantially more revenue for the city than the existing adult bookstores and fast-food franchises.    &quot;Is it fair to say four years later that because the city has had some good years this is a giveaway?,&quot; says Veronica Hackett, a Park Tower official. &quot;This was a difficult project to finance. We hung in there with four years of lawsuits.&quot;    Some critics fear that the Park Tower office buildings would render the famous crossroads sterile. The proposed towers, designed by Philip Johnson and John Burgee and ranging from 31 to 58 stories, are at odds with the &quot;historic value of Times Square as a public space,&quot; says New York University historian Thomas Bender.    Is the project supposed to rescue a legendary street, critics ask, or merely create another windfall in real estate? Mr. Weisbrod, president of the project, asserts that its main purpose is to &quot;transform the block into something exciting.&quot; The offices, he says, are only a means.    When not fighting critics, officials have been trying to retain project developers, many of whom have had second thoughts.    Because property values in the surrounding area have risen, developers expect they will have to pay a stiff price for 42nd Street land if the project goes through. Banks are extremely reluctant to finance the office towers, Park Tower's Mrs. Hackett says. &quot;Many wouldn't even consider it,&quot; she adds. The hotel site has had similar troubles.    The $600 million trade mart also has been held up. Now, however, the state expects to be bailed out by the Kennedy family. The family, which runs one of the country's most successful trade marts in Chicago, is preparing a proposal for the 42nd Street mart.    Park Tower and others say they would be ready to move ahead if a mart were assured. &quot;When a deal is signed on the mart, we're confident that the rest will fall into place,&quot; says Harry Oster, an official of Urban Development Corp., the state agency that would condemn the land.    He adds: &quot;We're going to achieve our goal. It's a block that's going to be brought back for all New Yorkers.&quot;    ---             Time's Square's Proposed Rejuvenation   Size: 13 acres   Offices: 4.1 million square feet   Merchandise Mart: 2.4 million square feet   Hotel: 750 rooms   Theater: two commercial Broadway theaters; two fornonprofit theater; four under planning for legitimate theater   Retail: 200,000 square feet   Estimated cost: $2.5 billion   Landlord: N.Y.
