Furthermore,Salvatores et al. have stressed the need to extend the resolved resonanceregion above the present ENDF/B limit of 300 eV for the calculation ofDoppler effect and self-shielded group cross sections. The purpose ofour work is to improve the representation of the {sup 239}Pu cross sectionsby using a multilevel formalism (which avoids the need for the file 3contributions) and by extending the resolved resonance range from 300up to 600 eV. The present resonance analysis is based on the Reich-Mooremultilevel formalism and was performed with the Bayesian code SAMMY.The resonance parameters published in 1974 by Derrien were used as priorinformation. More than 200 levels and 1000 resonance parameters are includedin the analysis.</TEXT></DOC>
