Suddenly, multimillion-dollar credit lines were available to local companies. Sophisticated trust services were dangled before rich lumber and oil families. Dollars flowed from automated teller machines. Drive-up banks engulfed two square blocks.    With little Lufkin finally enjoying the benefits of big-city banking, people celebrated. The grand opening of one bank's four-story building was something: hot-air balloons, prizes and an appearance by gold-medal gymnast Mary Lou Retton.    But today, the &quot;new age&quot; promised by the arrival in Lufkin of Dallas-based First RepublicBank Corp. and Houston-based First City Bancorp. of Texas has sunk into a dark age.    Some Lufkin banks -- and hundreds of little ones like them that were absorbed by big Texas banking chains in recent years -- now are caught in a mess not of their own making. As loan losses at money-center banks in Dallas and Houston mount, banks all across the state are under strict orders to shovel hard-earned dollars to their sickly, cash-starved holding companies. So the banks are systematically cutting local borrowers' loans and credit lines.    The upshot: Deposits generated in places such as Lufkin are being used to refinance shaky real-estate and energy loans in Dallas and Houston. And with the little banks left with little money to lend, local businesses are being squeezed -- some right out of business. The big banks &quot;are just choking the entire state,&quot; says F. Hagen McMahon Jr., executive director of the Independent Bankers Association of Texas.    What annoys everyone in Lufkin from a local Chamber of Commerce to the Baptist minister is that the little town had nothing to do with the energy and real-estate lending debacle in Houston and Dallas but is paying the price for it.    As recently as 1985, nearly 66% of the deposits at the little banks now owned by First RepublicBank were recycled back to the small towns as loans. Today, that total has shrunk to 41%, and $1 billion once in borrowers' hands has vanished. And more than half the funds that its local banks invest in loans and securities have gone to Dallas, up from only 14% five years ago.    The never-ending crisis in Texas banking is panicking investors, who have lost millions of dollars. It's rattling the nation's capital, where administration officials fear that federal bailouts of Texas banks and thrift institutions, a third of which are insolvent, could increase the national budget deficit by more than $10 billion.    But numbers of that magnitude mean little to the people in Lufkin (population 32,000) and similar Texas towns. What troubles them is that a Lufkin merchant who had banked without difficulty for 22 years now can't get a $12,000 loan to repair the leaky roof of his store. Or that a local physician is being ordered to repay a $10,000 note for no apparent reason. Or that one of their good friends is going out of business because the big-city bankers arbitrarily cut him off.    &quot;Probably everybody that's in business in Lufkin has had their business whittled down or their borrowing power cut,&quot; says an auto dealer, whose own credit line was slashed 20%.    Lufkin's economy, like that of many towns big and small in the Southwest, had already been hit hard by the depression in the energy industry. Business and personal bankruptcies in East Texas have soared twentyfold since 1986. Thousands of mill workers, carpenters and oil-field roughnecks have lost their jobs. And now, as businessmen in Lufkin and other little towns turn to First RepublicBank and First City, the money-center banks that once promised them all the financial support they would ever need, they're getting little help.    In Lufkin, chicken farmers Edgar and Gilbert Burton recently filed personal bankruptcy petitions because their bankers refused to carry them until egg sales pick up in the fall. In nearby Henderson, Roger Ellis wakes up in the middle of the night because his Dallas-owned bank, which once promised him an endless supply of credit, is demanding that he pay off his construction company's note even though he has never missed a payment. And in Temple, hundreds of miles west of here, a roofing company was ordered by its Dallas-controlled bank to either pony up a $100,000 deposit or risk losing a $200,000 credit line.    &quot;The banks have gotten a little bit rough and a little bit mean,&quot; says James A. Jones, whose Piney Woods Tractor andamp; Implements Inc. in Lufkin has lost sales because the banks refuse to finance some of his customers.    First RepublicBank, whose federal bailout is pending, and First City, whose federally aided $1.5 billion restructuring was completed last month, both acknowledge that they are relying heavily on their small-town banks for funds, but they insist they're still lending money in the big cities and small towns. The problem, they say, is a lack of profitable opportunities anywhere in the state, and they are trying to limit risk.    In any event, a mixture of anger, frustration and feelings of betrayal lingers over Lufkin and other little logging towns nearby. That contrasts sharply with the spirit of optimism in such places a few years ago. Surrounded by abandoned paper mills and shut-in oil wells, these people had turned to the big-city bankers for help. Their own little banks were pressed for funds to expand, and the &quot;friendly bankers&quot; down at First RepublicBank and First City were offering to be helpful.    &quot;The banks promised big stuff,&quot; says Roger Mercer, a Nissan dealer here.    And for a time they delivered, opening a spigot of easy credit that created a building boomlet and changed the face of these backwoods towns. Apartment complexes, motels and a country club soon sprouted around Lufkin. There was even talk of turning the area into a tourist mecca using Lake Sam Rayburn, the state's largest man-made lake, as a playground.    Alas, the &quot;boys up in the glass tower,&quot; as locals now derisively call them, changed their tune. &quot;They took virtually everything out of the control of the local banks,&quot; Mr. Mercer says. The arm-around-the-shoulders friendliness that once greeted customers has given way to straight-arming strapped borrowers. Locals are whispering about a &quot;hit list&quot; of customers that First RepublicBank Lufkin is pressing for repayment.    First RepublicBank Lufkin recently summoned a Lufkin tractor dealer to the bank, where stone-faced accountants unfurled spread sheets showing the mortality rate of firms in his industry. It didn't matter that his loans were current. His company had lost money for two years running, and the odds were stacked against him. Bankers whom the businessman had never seen before said they would have to cut his credit line to $50,000 from $1 million. He was stunned: Without the big credit line, he couldn't finance his inventory, and sales would shrivel.    The tractor dealer eventually found financing at a small, locally owned bank and a large, out-of-town credit company. But he's still fuming. &quot;The dang thing that hacks me off is that all of a sudden I was a statistic and not an individual,&quot; he says.    Roger Ellis fears that soon he will become a statistic. For months, the 45-year-old construction contractor has been conducting a self-styled liquidation because First RepublicBank Henderson refused to refinance a $250,000 loan. Mr. Ellis recently sold an excavator, two bulldozers and several trucks to cut his debt to $130,000. But he had to lay off 20 of his 25 workers, and one supplier is suing him for unpaid bills. Meanwhile, he is again digging trenches with his backhoe during the day and going sleepless many nights worrying about his debts. &quot;I feel like I've had all the wind knocked out of me,&quot; Mr. Ellis says. &quot;I've been whipped down.&quot;    Local bankers acknowledge that corporate officials at First RepublicBank in Dallas have ordered all outlying banks to cut some commercial and real-estate lending. &quot;The pressure is there to identify the problems,&quot; says H.J. &quot;Jay&quot; Shands III, the bank's 33-year-old chief executive whose family ran the Lufkin bank before First RepublicBank bought it. And he concedes that the bank's new owners, hard-pressed for deposits (federal regulators are pumping between $2.5 million and $3.5 million into the chain's banks each week), are enforcing credit policy rigidly.    &quot;Our policy book was just as thick before the bank was sold,&quot; says Mr. Shands, pointing to a three-ring blue binder. &quot;The only difference was we never read it.&quot;    Edgar and Gilbert Burton wish they never had. The two Lufkin chicken farmers filed their bankruptcy petitions last month after First RepublicBank Lufkin refused to lend them the $500,000 they needed to feed their 750,000 chickens and meet other obligations. The brothers already owed the bank $2.5 million, and local officials told them that another loan would exceed the Lufkin bank's legal limit. They were told to plead their case with corporate officials at First RepublicBank Dallas, whose now-defunct agricultural-loan division had once lent the funds to purchase a second chicken ranch and just about anything else they wanted.    But their pleas fell on deaf ears. First RepublicBank Dallas &quot;was broker than I was,&quot; Edgar Burton says. &quot;If I had any money, they would have wanted to borrow it.&quot;    The hard line taken by &quot;the boys up in the glass tower&quot; is riling the whole town. In the midst of a meeting, a Lufkin attorney suing First City gets a call from a stunned physician who says one of the banks just ordered him to repay a $10,000 note. The lawyer fuels the flames. &quot;These damn people in Houston and Dallas sure are fangling things up, aren't they?&quot; he says.    Charles S. McIlveene, the pastor of Lufkin's First Baptist Church, says donations had dropped so much that he held off filling two staff openings. Concerned about the church's ability to pay for a $3.5 million expansion, the church opted for a three-year note on the project rather than a shorter term.    The credit squeeze is also creating emotional strain. The manager of Lufkin's Waldenbooks says that the store frequently runs out of &quot;Overcoming Depression&quot; and that tapes on how to deal with stress are a hot item. Local psychotherapists say cases of stress and family tension are soaring. Edgar Burton concedes that at first he was deeply depressed watching the family's business collapse after 33 years. &quot;I've done my crying,&quot; he says.    Mr. Shands, the banker, is acutely aware of the pain his bank's credit squeeze is creating in Lufkin. &quot;It hasn't been pleasant,&quot; he says. &quot;I wish I'd been a schoolteacher.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
