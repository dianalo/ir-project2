I can only think of one thing and it may be a realkiller.andP;  You still must go to Apple if you want to buy a Macintosh; this iswhat is known in the industry as single-sourcing, and few savvy corporatepurchasing agents would consider pegging their entire company's future on acomputer system that is only available from one vendor.andP;  IBM veryintelligently left the PC market wide open, something that probably resultedin more sales for Big Blue rather than less; even though there are moreclones than true blue machines around today, the share is small, but totalsales were so massive because of the attractive prices and multiple sourcesthat IBM probably profited from the competition - certainly the consumer did.andO;Will Apple ever really succeed as more than a niche machine in the corporateworld, or will it continue to fill a small need, that of a dedicated computerused by selected departments which need its special advantages such as artand publishing departments? Only time will tell, but if this marvelous MacIIcx fails to find a big place in many business locations then the fear ofsingle- sourcing is about the only reason I can think of.andP;  Desktop publishersshould rush to see this machine; it is perfect for most jobs and, as for homeusers, if you need, or can afford this much power the IIcx is a marvelousmachine.andP;  (John McCormick/19890824)</TEXT></DOC>
