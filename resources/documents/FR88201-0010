Once a State decides to provide for longitudinaluse in its accommodation plan and establishes procedures which meet thecriteria described in the rule, the State, rather than FHWA, will determinewhether a particular request to use the longitudinal right-of-way, includingdirect access, is appropriate. For administrative convenience, States mayset up procedures for individual and/or class approvals of such requests.A State also can decide not to permit longitudinal use, but this must beexpressed in its accommodation plan.This process, therefore, leaves to the States the decision as to whetherparticular applications should be approved so long as they comply withthe regulatory criteria and thus is consistent with E.O. 12612 on ``Federalism.''The rule includes three criteria that State plans must meet: Assure thatlongitudinal installations do not adversely affect highway safety; evaluatethe effects that denial of a particular application would have on the productivityof agricultural land; and consider any impairment or interference withthe use of the highway.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>Under the existing FHWA regulations, the need for allowing utility installationsto cross over or under Federal-aid highway right-of-way is recognized,provided certain conditions are satisfied. The policy is designed so thatthe Federal-aid highway systems do not act as barriers to necessary andorderly land use and development. The existing policy, although stronglydiscouraging the longitudinal use of the freeway right-of-way within theaccess control limits, does not prohibit such use, provided certain conditionsare met.On December 19, 1986, the FHWA issues a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM)(51 FR 45479, FHWA Docket No. 86-15). On February 11, 1987, the commentperiod was extended to March 17, 1987 (52 FR 4349). The NPRM solicitedcomments on proposed revisions to regulations on the accommodation of utilityfacilities and private lines on the right-of-way of Federal-aid and directFederal highway projects. The proposed revisions sought to clarify requirementsregarding utility use of Federal-aid highway right-of-way and to modifythe conditions under which certain types of utilities such as fiber opticsmay be located longitudinally on Federal-aid freeways.A total of 89 commenters responded to the NPRM. This included 40 Statehighway agencies (SHA's), 15 utility companies, four governors, four contractors,six national organizations, seven private citizens and 13 others includingother State agencies, local agencies and universities.There were 76 general comments on the NPRM. Thirty-two commenters expressedsupport for loosening of the longitudinal occupancy policy. Forty-two commentersexpressed unfavorable responses to the use of controlled access right-of-wayfor longitudinal utility installations. The others offered technical commentsor did not indicate any preference. Of the responses from SHA's, 24 wereunfavorable and 10 were favorable. Comments from State governors, privatecitizens, universities, and consultants provided 12 unfavorable responsesand 15 favorable responses. Eight utility companies supported the rulemaking,and six did not. One offered technical suggestions only.Further analysis of the general comments showed that 31 of the 42 unfavorablecomments expressed opposition to any change from the existing policy. Severalexpressed strong opposition to any change and cited potential safety problemsand fears of proliferation as reasons. Several expressed concern for theavailability of information needed to justify use of freeway right-of-wayunder the NPRM. The favorable comments most often expressed support ornon-opposition with the condition that safety should not be compromised.The specific comments on the NPRM mirror in many respects the general comments.Of the 40 comments on specific provisions, 18 were favorable, 21 may becharacterized as unfavorable, and one was technical. The 18 comments infavor of the specific requirements supported the opportunity for use ofcontrolled access right-of-way. Many of the comments which expressed oppositionindicated an anticipated difficulty with the justification that would benecessary to support use of the freeway right-of-way.The following discussion addresses the substantive issues most frequentlymentioned by the commenters:1. Safety and OperationsUnder the NPRM, access from the main lanes or ramps would be permittedunder very strictly controlled conditions. Nine commenters, mostly utilities,responded that access should be allowed from the main lanes and ramps undervarious forms of permits or specifications that would require demonstrationof the utility's abilities to comply with traffic control measures. NineSHA's opposed this position.Most of the commenters recognized that after a fiber optic cable systemis installed, need for access for maintenance or service is minimal. Severalnoted that the actual maintenance experience with a system in a freewayenvironment is uncertain because none have been in service long enough.However, judging from other cable installations, very little line maintenanceis necessary except at repeater stations or when an accident occurs. Somecommenters reported problems with splices and recommended that they belocated at non-strategic locations, such as in interchange areas whereaccess would be easy. Others recommended that repeater stations be locatedat or outside of the right-of-way line so that more frequent maintenancewould not be disruptive to highway traffic.The final rule provides criteria under which States may permit direct access,after FHWA approves the plans, from the main lanes or ramps. Those Statesthat oppose this form of access are not required to allow such access andtheir accommodation plans can reflect this fact. Prior to granting directaccess, States must address the conditions under which it will permit suchaccess in their accommodation plans and the accommodation plans must beapproved by FHWA.The NPRM also raised a question regarding the need for specific standardsin the rule. Seven commenters believed that some standards were necessary.However, there was no agreement on what type of standards would be appropriatenor whether the standards should be part of the rule. Three of the commentersrecommended that standards be devised but not included in the rule.FHWA is not adopting detailed programmatic standards for States to adoptuniformly for permits for direct access. States may grant such permitsconsistent with the generic criteria established by FHWA.There were 18 comments on a question regarding nature, type and extentof controls on operations and safety if access were to be permitted fromthe main lanes of a freeway. Nine of the responses were from SHA's whoseprimary concerns were for proper signing and control of the utility contractor.A frequent SHA statement was that they do not have enough personnel topolice the proposed policy under a permit process. Several SHA's and someutilities recommended strict permit procedures or demonstration of abilityto perform under freeway conditions. The utilities responding to this questionsuggested that the installations be at the right-of-way edge to minimizetraffic conflicts.Direct access requirements are included in the final rule and must be addressedby the States in their accommodation plan to ensure that highway safetyis not adversely affected. Those States that have concerns can prohibitdirect access or address them through their longitudinal use plan, withoutunnecessary Federal oversight.2. Class Approval ProcessThe NPRM also proposed that States could establish, with FHWA prior approval,class approval procedures. Once a plan containing class approval was approvedby FHWA, individual longitudinal use requests within the class could beexpedited. The class approval process was established for the administrativeconvenience of the States and it was anticipated that it would assist inexpediting approvals where warranted. FHWA solicited comments on the types,terms and conditions that should be imposed on various utilities undera class approval process. Twelve of the 26 comments on this question werefrom SHA's and directed at the class of utility or type of installation.The comments were in general agreement that there could be a general classof utilities which by type of installation (buried at various depths) andby low frequency of maintenance and low incidence of danger which couldbe accommodated at or near the right-of-way line. Other commenters, mainlyutility companies, thought standards or criteria of installation shouldinclude location, depth, access provisions and marking as factors for determiningclass approval.There were 14 comments on a question as to what type of utility could warrantapproval under the class approval process. The general consensus was thatclass approval could be given for a utility that (1) could be buried easily,(2) would present very low hazard, (3) would require very little maintenanceand (4) would be similar to fiber optics, and (5) could be identified asa class of utilities. Several responses indicated that transmission facilitieswould meet the class approval criteria, but distribution would not. Somecommented that overhead facilities would not be warranted because of visualintrusion and potential for damage. Others expressed views that undergroundfacilities, such as water, gas, oil and sewer lines, would not be warrantedbecause of potential danger or the need for frequent service.The final rule enables States to establish class approval procedures, butdoes not distinguish between types of utilities for which class approvalwill be granted.3. Limiting Increased Use to Certain Types of UtilitiesThe NPRM solicited comments on whether only certain types of utilitiesshould be permitted increased use of the right-of-way. Twenty-three SHA's,eight utilities and two private citizens responded to this issue. SeventeenSHA's thought that allowing access for certain utilities while excludingothers would be discriminatory, difficult to justify or might raise chargesof restraint of trade. Other States thought there would be no problemsor that any conflicts could be worked out with proper procedures. Sevenof the eight utilities indicated access could be provided fairly if certaincontrols were adhered to. The two private citizens thought it would notbe legally or politically possible to allow only certain types of utilities.As noted above, the final rule does not distinguish between types of potentialusers. As long as the regulatory criteria are met, the States will havethe option of determining which types of utilities should be permittedalong the right-of-way within their jurisdiction. The NPRM, however, didnote that underground utility facilities which require little maintenanceor servicing obviously would have less impact than above ground utilityinstallations which are more subject to environmental deterioration andmay create a safety hazard as a roadside obstacle. States are free to makesuch a distinction among classes in their accommodation plans, and if consistentwith criteria established by this rule, would be approved. Thus, as partof the accommodation plan, States can distinguish between type, natureor function of utility and potential impact of freeway use in setting upa class approval process.4. Impact on Future Highway Construction and MaintenanceThere were four comments on this specific question, three from SHA's andone from a utility. The SHA's expressed concern for the proliferation ofuse by fiber optics lines and other types of utilities. Their commentsindicated that more problems could be anticipated with placement of signing,illumination and guard rails away from the roadway. There was also concernexpressed about the presence of utilities limiting further ability to addto or reconstruct the highway. There were no specific comments which addressedthe economic impact on future highway construction and maintenance.The final rule includes a provision which requires States to consider theinterference or impairment of the use of the highway in reviewing applicationsfor longitudinal use of the right-of-way. This provision is consistentwith 23 U.S.C. 109(l)(1).5. Governmental Usage/Defense Enhancements of Telecommunications FacilitiesSeven SHA's and two utilities responded to the question of whether a portionof the fiber optic cables should be specifically dedicated for a givenuse as a condition to approving such installations. Five States thoughtdedicated use should be required. Two States and the two utilities saidit should not be required. Two States also thought specific defense enhancementsshould be required. The two responding utilities said such enhancementsshould not be required. One State and one private citizen thought a defensecommunication system would be vulnerable to attack if placed on the InterstateSystem.The final rule does not include any requirements on this issue. If Statesdecide that dedicated use is necessary or specific enhancements shouldbe required, these may be included in their accommodation plans. FHWA,however, will not consider the presence or absence of such restrictionsin reviewing and approving accommodation plans.6. Fees for Use of Right-of-WayThere were 34 responses to the general question of whether and how a feesystem could be implemented for use of the right-of-way. The general consensuswas that some type of fee should be charged. Four utilities and one utilityorganization thought the charge should be limited to administrative costs.Six utilities thought there should be no fee. The reasons for no fee rangedfrom ``a fair fee system would be difficult to implement'' to ``utilitiespay for highways through taxes.'' One State thought there should be nofee if the utility agrees to an indemnification condition. In three Statesthe laws would have to be changed to allow collection of fees. In one Statethe laws prohibit fees being greater than administrative costs. Othersfavored charging fees and suggested various methods for setting them.There was a consensus among respondents that right-of-way should be leasedrather than purchased, that States should collect and retain fees collected,and that the revenues should be earmarked for highway purposes.The final rule contains no provision requiring the SHA's to charge forutility use of Federal-aid highway right-of-way. Rather, the amount, ifany, and disposition of fees collected is left to State discretion. FHWAintends to continue to review this issue. Section 126 of the Surface Transportationand Uniform Relocation Assistance Act of 1987 (23 U.S.C. 156) requiresthat States charge fair market value for the sale, use, or lease of right-of-wayairspace. However, utility use and occupancy was specifically exemptedfrom this requirement. FHWA intends to leave this issue to State discretionpending further review.7. Benefits To Be Expected From Increased Use of Right-of-WayThe NPRM asked for comments on the benefits that could be gained by allowingan increased use of the right-of-way. There were nine comments addressingthis issue. Those from SHA's (four) were clouded by the question of whetherfees would be charged and how the amount of the fee would be determined.Two of the SHA's reported that there should be an economic benefit to theutility because the utility would not have to purchase private right-of-way.One SHA indicated there would be little difference in cost of highway right-of-wayversus private right-of-way. The general conclusion was that there wouldbe some benefit to the utility. The utilities commented that there wouldbe considerable benefit to the utility due to reduced construction costs,greater protection offered by freeway right-of-way, and ease in dealingwith one agency. All these benefits would be passed on to the utility user.Any fee involved would be of economic benefit to the highway agency.The final rule does not require that States consider governmental benefitsin submitting a plan for FHWA approval or in reviewing individual longitudinaluse applications. States are free to evaluate governmental benefits andthe absence or presence of such a requirement in their accommodation planswill not be considered by FHWA.<ITAG tagnum="84">Final Rule</ITAG>In light of these comments the FHWA is revising its regulation to incorporatethe policy as outlined in the NPRM with some modifications and clarification.Under the final rule, as part of the utility accommodation plan, Statesmust indicate whether or not longitudinal installations of utilities willbe permitted and submit procedures for the processing of individual requestsand, if desired, for class approvals. Once FHWA has approved the plan,it will no longer review installations requests. This does not mean thatStates must adopt installation approval procedures. However, if Stateschoose not to permit installations, they must indicate clearly their intentto prohibit installation in their accommodation plan. This regulation requiresthat revisions be made to existing State plans and that, as indicated inthe existing regulation (23 CFR 645.215), such revisions must be submittedto FHWA within 1 year of the effective date of this rule.There are two principal statutory provisions (23 U.S.C. 109 and 111) theStates must be cognizant of in developing utility accommodation plans andwhich FHWA will ensure are complied with before approving such plans. Under23 U.S.C. 109(l)(1), in determining whether any right-of-way on any Federal-aidsystem should be used for accommodating any utility facility, the Secretary``shall'':<ITAG tagnum="15">_Ascertain the effect such use will have on the highway and safety;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Evaluate the direct and indirect impact on agricultural lands ifa freeway right-of-way request is denied; and,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Consider any interference with or impairment of the highway if arequest is granted.</ITAG>Under 23 U.S.C. 111, States are required to obtain the prior approval ofthe Secretary before adding any point of access to, or exit from, an existingapproved Interstate System project.The approval required under section 111 and Federal determinations requiredunder 109(l) will be deemed obtained by each State once it has submittedan accommodation plan that meets the requirements of this regulation andthe plan is subsequently approved by FHWA. The approval will be conditionedupon complete compliance with the procedures established in the State plan.Although the final rule requires that all States address longitudinal installationsin their accommodation plans, States can decide the extent of longitudinalinstallations that may be permitted or determine that no installationsbe permitted. All plans that contemplate longitudinal installations mustdemonstrate compliance with the criteria set out in the rule to obtainFHWA approval. For example, States may wish to permit and promote certaininstallations. On the other hand, States may choose to submit plans thatmaintain the current restrictive standards with regard to longitudinalinstallations or to prohibit longitudinal installations. As long as Statesmake a showing in their plans that the criteria of this regulation willbe met prior to allowing such installations, States will be able to permitthem under the approved plan.<ITAG tagnum="84">Specific Provisions</ITAG>1. Joint Use Policy Statement: Section 645.205Paragraph (b) of andSection; 645.205 adds a policy statement which encouragesjoint highway and utility planning in the design of new highways and theaccommodation of utilities in existing highway corridors. This policy statementresponds to the comments which pointed out the tradition of accommodatingutility service and highway service in the same right-of-way.2. Utility Definitions: Section 645.207Section 645.207 clarifies the definitions of utility and utility facilitiesto include such things as communication lines owned by or dedicated toa governmental agency for its own use. This brings such facilities underthe same comprehensive accommodation policy as public utilities. The definitionsare also expanded to include hardware and facilities which are part ofthe utility's physical plant and necessary facilities for the utility'soperations.3. Criteria for Approval: Section 645.209Section 645.209(c) provides that to obtain FHWA approval, the State planmust demonstrate that it will meet the requirements of 23 U.S.C. 109(l)(1).Each State accommodation plan that contemplates longitudinal installationsmust adequately demonstrate that such criteria are met prior to installationof any utility.The criteria are:<ITAG tagnum="15">_The State must ascertain the effects utility installations will haveon highway and traffic safety, since in no case shall any use be permittedwhich would adversely affect safety.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_The State must evaluate the affects the denial of a particular applicationwould have on the productivity of agricultural land.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_The State must consider any impairment or interference with the useof the highway.</ITAG>These provisions are based on section 109(l)(1) and section 111. The NPRMhad proposed to adopt the American Association of State Highway and TransportationOfficials (AASHTO) Policy on the Accommodation of Utilities Within FreewayRight-of-Way standards as part of the criteria for approval of an accommodationplan. The final rule does not do so.While the criteria must be met by the States to obtain FHWA approval ofthe accommodation plan, they are intended as minimum requirements and Statesare free to adopt additional criteria, including those used by AASHTO.The NPRM proposed additional specific elements, such as the costs and difficultiesof using alternative locations, as criteria for FHWA approval. These elementshave not been included as regulatory conditions that States must meet toobtain FHWA approval of their accommodation plan because FHWA believesthat, once plans are approved, States will be able to make the necessarydeterminations in implementing their accommodation policies consistentwith the statutory and regulatory criteria.<ITAG tagnum="84">Utility Standards/Strips</ITAG>FHWA is including andSection; 645.209(c)(2)(v) as a technical clarification.This provision essentially reflects the existing regulation with respectto utility strips and was inadvertently omitted from the NPRM's proposedregulatory language. It was not FHWA's intent to delete this requirementand, therefore, the rule contains provisions for establishment of a utilitystrip or corridor in which a longitudinal utility could be placed. Theutility strip would be formed along the outer right-of-way limit by establishinga utility access control line between the proposed utility installationand the through roadways. The means of enforcing the utility access controlline would have to be addressed in the State's utility accommodation policy.No service connections would be allowed from within the utility corridor.Under this concept the original control of access line and right-of-wayfence would not have to be moved to establish a utility strip.FHWA is not adding a specific provision, as requested in several commentsreceived from both highway and utility industry authorities, which recommendedestablishment of construction standards, location standards, or specialmarking techniques. These matters are already governed by Part 645, andno additional changes are needed at this time.4. State Accommodation Policies: Section 645.211Under andSection; 645.211(a) the State should limit the number or type ofutilities that could qualify for longitudinal occupancy if excessive utilityinstallations are likely which could result in conditions detrimental tothe highway and its use. The State must have uniform procedures for establishingreasonable limitations in its utility accommodation policy to preservethe integrity of the freeway and preclude proliferation of utility occupancy.The procedures should provide a means of limiting utility use in a fairand equitable manner.<ITAG tagnum="84">Class Approval Procedures</ITAG>Section 645.211(e) requires the State to set forth in its accommodationpolicy detailed procedures, criteria and standards it will use to evaluateand approve proposed utility installations on freeways. To facilitate installations,a class approval process is established. Under this process the State coulddistinguish by type, nature or function of utility and potential impacton freeway use those utilities which would be considered for approval underthe provisions of andSection; 645.209(c). This procedure recognizes thatnot all utilities impact the highway or its use in the same way and maybe treated differenly. These procedures would be added to the State's accommodationspolicy and if approved by the FHWA, used to evaluate utility proposals.The State highway agency would be responsible in each individual case toensure that the proposed utility installation meets the criteria of theapproved accommodation policy.6. Submission of Utility Application of FHWA: Section 645.215Section 645.215(d) has been modified regarding when individual utilityapplications are to be submitted to FHWA. Under the revised proceduresthe State must address longitudinal installation in its utility accommodationpolicy. The State's accommodation policy must address the criteria forutility use of highways in a manner sufficient to permit FHWA approval.FHWA will no longer review individual longitudinal use requests.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Impact</ITAG>The FHWA has determined that this document is not a major rule under ExecutiveOrder 12291. However, it is considered a significant regulation under theDepartment of Transportation's regulatory policies and procedures and hasbeen included in DOT's Regulatory Program for significant rulemakings.The final rule modifies and clarifies existing FHWA policy and proceduresfor accommodating utility facilities and private lines on the right-of-wayof Federal-aid and direct Federal highway projects. Specifically, policyand procedural clarifications are set forth concerning applications ofthe regulation to placement of new utility facilities on highway right-of-way,particularly longitudinal use of freeway right-of-way.The revisions will not impose any significant or substantial additionalreporting or recordkeeping requirments on the States. Additional justificationfor longitudinal occupancy would have to be supplied by the utility tothe States. Only the conditions under which certain types of utilitiesmay be located longitudinally on Federal-aid freeways will be modified.The modified conditions will merely be incorporated in the States' existingutility accommodation policies if a State so chooses.The regulatory impacts are addressed in more detail in a Regulatory Evaluation/RegulatoryFlexibility Analysis which has been prepared and is available for inspectionin the public docket and may be obtained by contacting Mr. James A. Carneyat the address provided under the heading ``For Further Information Contact.''For the above reasons, and under the criteria of the Regulatory FlexibilityAct, the FHWA hereby certifies that this action will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities.In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511),the reporting or recordkeeping provisions that are included in this regulationare being submitted for approval to the OMB.<ITAG tagnum="20">(Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program Number 20.205, HighwayPlanning and Construction.
