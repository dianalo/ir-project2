Lorenzo Formato, a participant in the federal Witness Protection Program, declined to disclose names of underworld figures but said his businesses were used to launder money. He said that &quot;some way or another, organized crime has its hand on the shoulder of every over-the-counter brokerage firm that's making any kind of money.&quot;    Mr. Formato, who spoke from behind a partition to conceal his identity, testified yesterday before the House Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee.    John Watson, president of the Security Traders Association, a trade group that represents traders in the OTC market, called Mr. Formato's characterization of the industry &quot;completely false.&quot; He said there is a big difference between &quot;fly-by-night&quot; penny-stock operations and other segments of the OTC market.    Mr. Formato said he raised millions of dollars as a stockbroker and stock promoter before he was arrested. He was an executive of Laser Arms Corp., which was indicted in September 1986 for bilking investors by promoting a so-called self-chilling beverage can that never existed. Mr. Formato pleaded guilty in the case.    Rep. Edward Markey (D., Mass.), chairman of the subcommittee, said he plans to draft legislation to fight penny-stock fraud, including the widespread use of &quot;blank-check blind pools.&quot; Blind pools are often used to raise money for shell firms with no discernible assets. </TEXT></DOC>
