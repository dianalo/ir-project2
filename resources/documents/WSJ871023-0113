In simple terms, efficient-market theory holds that investors act rationally and that prices react only to unanticipated events; thus, all publicly available information is worthless because it already has been discounted in current prices.    But so far, efficient-market theorists haven't been able to identify anything that would account for the market's convulsion -- other than the convulsion itself.    &quot;It's conceivable that a change in the well-informed forecast of future economic events moved the market as it did; you can't prove it one way or the other,&quot; ventures Prof. Sharpe. &quot;On the other hand, it's pretty weird.&quot;    One factor might have been the increased volatility of the market in the days leading up to Monday's collapse, says Fischer Black, a partner at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. and co-author of the standard option-pricing model that is a foundation of the widely used hedging strategy known as portfolio insurance.    In this view, rising expectations about volatility would depress prices as investors found it worthwhile to take on that added uncertainty only if prices were discounted to compensate for the added risk.    Estimates of that volatility -- measured in terms of the standard deviation of prices observed in the market -- have risen from 16% a few months ago to an average of 20% last week. &quot;On Monday, of course, it was much higher -- exceeding 100% with no trouble at all,&quot; adds Mr. Black. His prediction for the next three months is 38%.    Indeed, Mr. Black says, &quot;the only insight that market theory offers at this point is that stock prices are going to be more volatile than they have been.&quot; But, he adds, &quot;we don't know in what direction.&quot;    The theorists are also puzzled that they can't find anything to explain why the market had remained so out of line with other assets, such as bonds, for so long before the crash. &quot;There was no rational case for things being so far up there, only romantic reasons -- things like new buyers such as the Japanese coming in because they saw value there,&quot; says Peter Bernstein, an efficient-market theorist and president of a pension-consulting firm bearing his name.    Moreover, when things began to fall apart, there was a persistent pricing discrepancy of 10% to 20% between stock index futures contracts and the underlying stocks that started Monday and has persisted on and off since. &quot;That shouldn't have existed,&quot; says Mr. Black.    At least some efficient-market proponents insist that the discrepancy can be explained partly by chaotic trading conditions and the restrictions imposed starting Tuesday on futures trading and program trading -- a strategy of trading on price differences between futures and stocks. &quot;Efficiency is affected by the cost of transactions, and the big overload in the system meant those costs became very high -- not just the real cost of execution but in terms of the uncertainty,&quot; says Merton Miller, a professor of finance at the University of Chicago School of Business. This hasn't provided &quot;a fair test,&quot; he says.    Maybe, but for efficient-market critics such as Lawrence Summers, a professor of economics at Harvard University, that's a little like saying the efficient-market theory didn't hold because the market in reality wasn't efficient. The fact that the discrepancy existed for days &quot;is a clear gap with the theory,&quot; he says. For years, &quot;every finance professor in America has taught that can't happen.&quot;    All the puzzlement in the ranks of the efficient-market theorists is being watched with glee by Prof. Summers and other &quot;investment behaviorists,&quot; who maintain that things such as greed, fear and panic play a much bigger role in determining stock prices than accepted market theory admits. Robert Shiller, an investment behaviorist and a professor of economics at Yale University, says: &quot;The efficient-market hypothesis is the most remarkable error in the history of economic theory. This is just another nail in its coffin.&quot;    Prof. Summers adds, &quot;If anyone did seriously believe that price movements are determined by changes in information about economic fundamentals, they've got to be disabused of that notion by Monday's 500-point movement.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
