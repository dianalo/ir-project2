Leading environmental groups also say that even if the oil fromthe largest spill ever in the United States or Canada doesn't reachBritish Columbia this time, the Exxon Valdez incident illustratesthat an accident closer to home is inevitable.   The spill, which has prompted parliamentary debate in Ottawa, isabout 650 miles from Canadian waters and doesn't threaten to changecourse toward the south, according to the federal fisheries,environment and transportation ministers.   Fisheries Minister Tom Siddon returned to the lobby ofParliament on Wednesday with a map of Alaska and his account thatthe spill won't affect Canada.   However, James Fulton, who represents in the House of CommonsBritish Columbia's northwestern Skeena district closest to thespill, said his information was that the slick is only about 250miles away.   That information ``is clear beyond a reasonable doubt,'' Fultonsaid during the emergency debate he requested Tuesday night. He isthe environment critic for the socialist New Democratic Party, thethird largest national party in Canada.   Fulton said Canada must be prepared to handle the spill if thewinds should change. He called it a ``monster now starting to comeout of (the) sound, and with pieces breaking off.''   ``If the wind changes direction and picks up, parts of the slickwill reach British Columbia. We can always hope that the winddoesn't blow,'' he said.   The presence of supertankers in the sea lanes off of BritishColumbia has been a longtime subject of debate in Canada.   Ms. Zimmermann said some people consider the possibility of aneventual disaster off of the Canadian coast as a mathematicalcertainty, not a statistical probability.   She said that the wildlife shared with Alaska includes theparent stocks of sea mammals such as sea otters. She also expressedconcern about the gray whales that are migrating north from theirwinter zones off of Mexico's Baja California coast.   The opposition Liberal Party also supported the New Democrats'call during the parliamentary debate for a federal inquiry into thesafety of coastal tanker shipping.   Parliament returned to session this week after a three-monthrecess following the election last fall of a second consecutivemajority government of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's ProgressiveConservative Party.</TEXT></DOC>
