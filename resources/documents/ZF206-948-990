 It intrigues me, however, that I can't generate the real programs.andO;Why is it that an assembly or BASIC program creates the actual program thatwe use in the end?andM;Computers in general, including the IBM PC, are able to process informationonly when it is presented as binary data known as machine code.andP;  Because itis in a binary form intended for a computer, machine code is not easilyunderstood when viewed by humans.andP;  To make the programming of computerseasier for humans, assembly language was developed.andM;Assembly language uses an easily understood mnemonic instruction to representeach machine code instruction.andP;  So, for example, the machine code instruction10110100 00110111 can be written as assembly code in the more understandableform of MOV AH, 34handM;Assembly language listings, such as those provided in the Utilities section,are known as source code and are translated by the assembler into theirmachine code equivalents.andP;  The BASIC program listed in each Utilities columnis an alternate method of creating a file for those readers who don't own acopy of an assembler.andP;  It simply stores an executable file as DATA statementsthat can be easily printed and typed in, and then re-creates the file whenrun.andP;  For more information on the way the BASIC program works, see theUtilities column, September 27, 1988.andM;A PC-XT can be modified to addandM;support for new hard disks byandM;altering the disk controller ROMandM;The fixed disk BIOS in the IBM PC-XT hard disk controller supports only fourdifferent sets of hard disk parameters.andP;  I would like to change the ROM onthe hard disk adapter.andP;  What are the equivalent EPROMs that I can use?andM;There is nothing very mysterious about ROM (read-only memory) chips.andP;  Theysimply contain software programs in an unerasable format.andP;  Modifying andreplacing ROMs with EPROM (erasable, programmable ROM) chips involves twosmall steps: a hardware task and a software task.andM;The hardware part of the job is the easiest.andP;  The mechanics of &quot;burning&quot; anEPROM are simple.andP;  Many mail-order firms and computer stores sell &quot;PROMburners&quot; that come complete with all the correct hardware and controlprograms needed to perform the task.andM;The modification also requires some software skill because you are, inessence, patching an executable program.andP;  A .COM file that has been badlymodified with DEBUG isn't likely to run properly.andP;  But a badly modified ROMwill probably stop the computer system from running at all.andM;The ROM chip on the XT hard disk controller holds 8K of data and is addressedstarting at C800:0000h.andP;  To replace it, use a 2764 EPROM.andP;  The &quot;27&quot; indicatesthe family of EPROM that the chip belongs to, and the &quot;64&quot; indicates thenumber of kilobits the chip contains.andP;  Thus, 64 kilobits arranged as an arrayof 8-bit bytes yields 8K of storage.andM;Memory options for dividing systemandM;board RAM can be somewhatandM;limited on some AT compatiblesandM;My mail-order AT clone came equipped with 640K on the motherboard configuredas two 256K banks and two 64K banks.andP;  Because it was billed as &quot;expandable to1MB,&quot; I replaced the existing 64K chips with 256K chips in order to get someextended memory.andM;After setting the configuration switches and running the SETUP program, Idiscovered that the hardware would not allow me to allocate memory as 640K ofconventional and 384K of extended.andP;  Instead, my only option was 512K ofconventional and 512K of extended.andP;  Is there an inexpensive way to get aroundthis limitation?andP;  I know I could purchase a memory board that would backfillconventional memory to 640K, but that seems like an expensive option.andM;The 80286 chip can address a full 1MB of memory when operating in real mode.andO;The IBM PC AT design, however, assigns the top 384K of the 1MB address spaceto ROM (read-only memory), leaving only 640K of address space for RAM.andP;  Anyadditional RAM must be addressed after the 1MB boundary.andM;The problem of RAM addressing on a system board appeared when manufacturersbegan allowing four banks of 256K RAM to be installed.andP;  Because the IBMdesign required that the lower 640K of RAM be addressed differently than thetop 384K of RAM, it required special hardware and influenced the design ofthe system board.andM;To save money, some manufacturers don't support split addressing.andO;Unfortunately, yours is one of them.andP;  Your best solution would be toreinstall the 64K chips on your system board, for a total of 640K.andP;  Then buya memory expansion board and install the two banks of 256K chips.andM;If you select the correct printerandM;driver, WordPerfect can outputandM;draft printouts instead of NLQandM;Using the November 11, 1986, PC Magazine printer issue as my guide, Ipurchased a Panasonic KX-P1091i II dot matrix printer.andP;  However, I'mexperiencing a problem that I hope you can solve.andM;I use the printer with a Compaq Deskpro and WordPerfect 4.2.andP;  Regardless ofthe position of the print mode selector switch, the printer makes a doublepass and produces near-letter-quality (NLQ) output.andP;  Although I have triedfonts 1 through 5 from within WordPerfect, I still cannot get the printer toprint in draft mode.andP;  Do I need to reset the DIP switches to make it work indraft mode, or is this not the problem?andP;  I would sincerely appreciate anyhelp that you could give me with this printing problem.andM;The problem you're having is not with the printer, but with the WordPerfectprinter driver.andP;  The WordPerfect program itself doesn't know what type ofprinter you have attached to your computer.andP;  It is the printer driver'sresponsibility to communicate with the hardware, and it is giving theinstructions to your printer to make two passes.andP;  As long as you use thePanasonic KX-P1091i driver, you will get NLQ output instead of draft.andM;To get the single-pass, or draft, output you want, simply select anotherprinter driver.andP;  WordPerfect 4.2 will support up to six different printerdefinitions.andP;  Simply define a new printer and select the definition &quot;DOS textprinter.&quot;andP;  When you wish to print in draft mode, use the printer numberassigned to this definition.andP;  The characters will be passed to the printerwithout interference.andM;An 80386 can speed up most ROMandM;operations by duplicating the ROMandM;code in shadow RAMandM;I have an AST Premium/286 computer with 1MB of RAM, an ATI EGA Wonder videocard, and a NEC MultiSync II monitor.andP;  This combination works quite well, butthe screen updates can be slow.andP;  Some of the new 386 machines map the machineBIOS and the video BIOS from ROM into RAM with the intent of speeding up thedisplay.andM;Is there a program that could do this on my machine?andP;  If so, would there be anoticeable improvement?andP;  If this was done, where in memory does the code go?andM;The amount of time the PC must take to read information from ROM (read-onlymemory) is generally greater than the time spent reading the same informationfrom RAM (random-access memory).andP;  Because of this, copying the BIOS (BasicInput/Output System) program to RAM will generally speed up a computer'sperformance.andP;  ROM code, however, is usually written to execute at a specificaddress and cannot be relocated by simply copying the code to anotherlocation.andM;On your 80286 computer, assuming the ROM could be patched to run in a newlocation, the memory occupied by the ROM would be removed from the 640Kallowed for programs.andP;  Since the typical BIOS ROM for an AT takes up 32K,this much memory would be taken up as if the BIOS were a TSR program.andM;On an 80386 computer, however, the rules change.andP;  Memory located at anyphysical address can be &quot;mapped&quot; by the 80386 to seem to appear at anotheraddress.andP;  Thus, a 32K section of memory, physically located past the 1MBlimit of DOS, can be mapped to appear in the same location as the originalBIOS ROM.andP;  The ROM code is copied to the new section of RAM, then the mappingis performed.andP;  The result is faster-executing ROM code.andP;  This technique isgenerally referred to as &quot;shadowing.&quot;andM;Interchanging the many font filesandM;from different application programsandM;isn't generally practicalandM;My problem is the general proliferation of fonts, which seem to be eating upall the real estate on my hard disk.andP;  I have fonts everywhere!andP;  I've gotscreen fonts, printer fonts for my HP LaserJet Series II, fonts for MicrosoftWindows, fonts for Microsoft Excel, and fonts for GEM.andP;  I've even got fontsfrom Bitstream that I use with Ventura Publisher.andP;  Is there anything I can doto allow me to use these fonts with other packages?andP;  I'm not a novice withPCs, but all these fonts have me baffled.andP;  Is there a book or softwarepackage that can lead me out of the font jungle?andM;Your problem with multiple fonts isn't unique.andP;  Software publishers tend todesign their products to use proprietary file and font formats.andP;  This isn'tnecessarily to be incompatible, but to enhance some specific aspect of theirprogram's performance.andP;  Plans to use a common format are also hamperedbecause no widely accepted standard for font formats is employed by softwaredevelopers.andP;  Users are required to carry the burden in the form of more filesto store.andM;Some companies, like Bitstream, manufacture the fonts themselves.andP;  Theprogram developers may convert the fonts to their own format and include themwith a package or provide a conversion utility.andP;  Unfortunately, there's nogeneral method for determining which fonts are compatible with whichpackage--other than the one they came with.andM;EGAs don't display wide bordersandM;and sometimes don't work withandM;screen-recall programsandM;When I had a CGA monitor, I had no dark margin around my monitor.andP;  I am toldthat it is the nature of the EGA monitor to have a dark margin.andP;  The majorityof the screen responds to COLOR.COM.andP;  Do you know how I can get color overthe entire surface of the EGA monitor?andM;With the CGA monitor, I used a program called WAITASEC that would allow me toscroll back anything that went off the screen.andP;  Since I started using my EGA,I find that these programs do not backscroll beyond what is on the screen.andO;Do you know why?andM;The area of the display that appears as a border is referred to as theoverscan area.andP;  On a CGA, this area is quite a bit larger than on the EGA.andO;As you note, this is a characteristic of the design of the EGA specification,and it isn't something that can be fixed easily.andM;If you're willing to experiment, however, some partial solutions were givenby Charles Petzold in PC Magazine's two-part series &quot;Exploring the EGA,&quot;August 1986 and September 16, 1986.andP;  Programs like WAITASEC (PowerProgramming, PC Magazine, November 26, 1985) depend on intercepting theScroll Screen function request to make a copy of the line of text that isabout to roll off the top of the screen.andP;  To increase the display speed, someEGA cards perform this function internally.andP;  Thus WAITASEC is never notifiedthat it must save the text.andM;Ask the PC TutorandM;The PC Tutor solves practical problems and explains points of generalinterest about using your hardware and software more productively, andanswers basic questions about DOS and systems in general.andP;
