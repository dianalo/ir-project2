A federal grand jury accused the group's leader, Yahweh benYahweh, and 16 followers of involvement in the slayings of 14people, including so-called ``white devils'' who were killed togain entrance to the sect's inner circle.   Some victims were decapitated. Others' ears were cut off, U.S.Attorney Dexter Lehtinen said.   Yahweh and several members of the sect were arrested in earlymorning raids Wednesday.   ``Any dissenter was subject to extreme violence, includingmurder, to maintain control of the organization,'' Lehtinen said.The sect also used ``random violence as a ritual membershipinitiation rite,'' he said.   The indictment accuses those named of racketeering, conspiracyand extortion from 1981 to 1987.   Yahweh, 55, born Hulon Mitchell Jr., regulated all aspects ofhis followers' lives, including when and how they had sex,sometimes ordering women members to his own bed, Lehtinen said.   The Yahwehs consider themselves the true chosen people, andYahweh ben Yahweh - who claims to be the son of God and whose nameis Hebrew for ``God, son of God'' - had in the past referred to allwhites as devils.   Recently the Yahwehs, who have claimed about 10,000 members,diminished their anti-white rhetoric and became known as hardworkers who built a modest empire of 27 small businesses andproperties. Their combined tax value has been assessed at $3million, but their market value is believed to be more.   Yahweh was arrested by the FBI in a New Orleans hotel. Threeothers were arrested in Lafayette, La. His top aide, Judith Israel,or Linda Gaines, was taken into custody in Atlanta, and anotherarrest was made in Durham, N.C.   Seven members were arrested at the sect's Temple of Love inMiami.   The group's enterprising spirit, strict religious practices,promotion of family values and strong opposition to drugs drewpraise from local officials.   Mayor Xavier Suarez recently attended a ribbon-cutting at aYahweh store with the sect's leader, who has also received civichonors for rebuilding the inner city. A proclamation declared Oct.7 Yahweh ben Yahweh Day in Miami.   But the indictment said the businesses were built in part by thethreat of violence and by extortion of contributions from reluctantblack neighborhoods. The charges include firebombing homes afterpeople opposed fund-raising efforts.   The sect first became widely known in 1986 when it took over adrug-infested Opa-locka apartment complex, evicting residents andpromising to make it a crack-free haven.   Two residents who resisted were shot to death, and sect memberRobert Rozier, a former pro football player, was convicted in theslayings.   Rozier - who could have faced the electric chair - agreed toprovide much of the evidence against Yahweh in exchange for a22-year sentence, sect lawyer Ellis Rubin said.   Most of the slaying victims listed in the indictment were Yawhehmembers who left the group or opposed their leader. Some were shot,others decapitated and some beaten to death.   Seven white men were killed by those applying to join theBrotherhood, a secret group within the sect. Yahweh ordered theears cut off some victims as proof they were killed, Lehtinen said.   Rubin, who has accused authorities of persecuting the group,said he was surprised by Wednesday's raids. He said he toldauthorities that sect members would surrender after thelong-expected indictment was handed up.   In Washington, FBI Director William Sessions denied there wasany harassment or racism involved in the prosecution.   Rubin said he would appear with Yahweh at a New Orleans hearingscheduled for Friday. Four of the 17 defendants were still beingsought.</TEXT></DOC>
