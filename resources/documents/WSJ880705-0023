Teachers earned 17% more on average than all American workers in 1987 and 10% more than all government workers, the American Federation of Teachers said.    &quot;It's the seventh straight year salaries have exceeded inflation,&quot; said F. Howard Nelson, an assistant research director of the union. The survey of state departments of education, released Friday, found starting salaries for the just-ended school year were $18,557, up 5.4% from a year ago and more than double the $9,085 paid in 1977. The average pay for all teachers was up 5.5% from 1987.    Jewell C. Gould, union director of research, predicted a similar boost for the school year starting this fall.    The data show Alaska at the top of the pay scale with average pay of $40,510 and South Dakota at the bottom with $19,758.    But the AFT also ranked the states by cost-of-living and by how teachers' pay compared with salaries of other workers. An adjustment for cost-of-living differences &quot;shows that Michigan, Alaska, California and Minnesota pay teachers the most. Louisiana, Arkansas, Hawaii and South Dakota (are) on the bottom.&quot;    Adjusted for inflation, the record $28,085 average salary is only $665 more than teachers earned in 1972. The average 1972 salary of $9,705 equals $27,420 in today's prices. The beginning salary of $6,970 in 1972 is equal to $19,739 in today's dollars -- more than today's starting salaries.    &quot;Connecticut reported the highest salary increase -- 15.8% for 1987-88,&quot; pushing its average pay level to $33,776, fifth in the nation, the union report said.    Al Fondy, president of both the Pittsburgh and Pennsylvania Federations of Teachers, said that under a new four-year contract, average salaries in Pittsburgh will rise from $38,000 to $46,000 by 1991, with top-scale veterans earning $51,000.    Rochester, N.Y., has a contract that will push its top scale to more than $55,000, plus the possibility that lead teachers will earn nearly $70,000.    Although teaching pays more on average than other government work and more than the average job in the private sector, the report said the average male, year-round worker earned 14% more in 1987 than the average teacher, who gets summers off. The average female, year-round worker made only 73% as much as teachers, most of whom are women.    The AFT said Alaska, California, Connecticut, Michigan, New York and New Jersey have starting salaries in excess of $20,000, while only Vermont and Idaho start teachers off at less than $15,000.    In addition, today's teachers are more experienced, with nearly 16 years in the classoom compared with less than 11 years in 1972, the union said. </TEXT></DOC>
