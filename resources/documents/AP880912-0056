Buddy Roemer'sspokesman, Jeff Cowart, said Sunday night. ``It just happened to bea very weak storm and all the parishes involved were very wellprepared.''   A preliminary report from the Office of Emergency Preparednessindicated no areas would qualify for federal assistance, Cowartsaid.   Residents, many of whom have returned home after otherhurricanes to find major damage, for the most part had only toclean downed tree limbs and blown debris after Florence came ashoreSaturday.   No lives were lost to the storm, officials said.   ``We were very lucky on this one, and well prepared. We're justhoping Gilbert doesn't head this way now,'' Cowart said.   Gilbert churned westward toward Jamaica today after skirting thesouthern coasts of Puerto Rico, Haiti and the Dominican Republic.   Heavy rain and stiff winds downed power lines and causedflooding in the Dominican Republic on Sunday night. There were noimmediate reports of casualties.   ``We should know within about 72 hours whether it's going to bea major threat to the United States or not,'' said NationalHurricane Center meteorologist Martin Nelson. ``We're trying not tothink about it hitting the United States yet _ that's a long waydown the road.''   In Delacroix, La., a levee broke during Florence, Cowart said,but was repaired by Saturday afternoon and water was being pumpedout of the area.   The list of storm damage for the most part included downed treesand power lines. Utility companies estimated 100,000 people lostpower because of the storm. Service was restored by Saturday night.   Flooding as a result of the hurricane was limited to``flood-prone areas,'' Cowart said. ``It wasn't bad anywhere, atthe worst, I'd say maybe 2 feet of water was in some places,'' hesaid.   Roemer, who cut short a trip to Japan because of the hurricane,was briefed on storm damage Sunday, Cowart said.   Cowart said 27,500 people were evacuated from low-lying homes,but had all returned by Saturday night.   ``The evacuation went very smoothly; we were very ready for thisstorm. It turned out to be a small one, which was fine with us, butwe were ready for it either way,'' he said.   Florence hit on the anniversary of Hurricane Betsy, a killerstorm that devastated southern Louisiana 23 years ago. Since then,officials say, the state has beefed up the levee systems thatprotect low areas from flooding and instituted sound evacuation andstorm procedures.</TEXT></DOC>
