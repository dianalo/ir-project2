 But of course, we've got regular duties suchas MAISRC [Major Automated Information Systems Review Council reviews,monitoring ADP programs and dealing with the standards community.andP;  We want toemphasize it more than it has been emphasized in the past.andM;GCN: Were your first MAISRC meetings successful?andM;KENDALL: I've been lucky because the two MAISRC meetings I've had saw generalagreement on the programs.andM;GCN: Do you expect to be so lucky in the coming year?andM;KENDALL: No.andP;  (Laughter.)andP;  I'm sure there's going to be times when there willbe people who really disagree and we may have some battles.andM;GCN: And your job will require knocking heads together.andM;KENDALL: I don't really call it that but if it comes to that, that is whatI'll have to do.andP;  I like the documentation and the background of the issuesto basically lead to the correct answer.andP;  If the system under review hasmerit it should carry itself through the MAISRC.andM;The importance of the MAISRC process was largely responsible for our recentupgrading of the Department of Defense Computer Institute.andP;  Hopefully, thenew IRM college will ensure better use of the MAISRC process.andM;GCN: Some recent reports indicate the Bush administration will direct deepcuts in defense spending plans.andP;  What role would you play in that?andM;KENDALL: I don't think anyone has defined how the process is going to workbut it will probably be run through the comptroller's office.andM;Last year when we amended the Fiscal 1989 budget the approach taken was toorder the services to reduce their budgets by a given amount.andP;  They had torevise the plans and submit them to the comptroller's office which reviewedthem.andP;  I don't know what approach may be taken this year.andM;GCN: How will the cuts affect ADP and ADP professionals?andM;KENDALL: Automated information systems are going to be reviewed in the budgetjust like all the weapons systems.andP;  So each one is going to be looked at onits own merits.andP;  Hopefully most AISes are intended to save money in the longrun so they have a much better chance of being approved in a future budget.andO;Saving money is one of the benefits that is addressed in critical nationaldefense needs.andP;  But those benefits from AISes are going to be weighed againstweapons systems and other defense requirements.andM;GCN: What can you do in the budget process to ensure ADP programs proceed andthat more money is found, if necessary, for them?andM;KENDALL: The services must present their proposed budgets to thecomptroller's office where they are reviewed.andP;  In every phase of the budgetprocess, where an AIS has merit was support it.andP;  However, I work for thecomptroller so my assessment of the value of an AIS is compared to otherassessments of the value of weapons systems, pay or real propertymaintenance.andM;GCN: How is ADP faring?andM;KENDALL: I don't have any percentage numbers to deal with.andP;  I haven't lookedat it that way.andM;GCN: What do you look for in weighing the merits of an AIS against othercompeting demands on the budget?andM;KENDALL: Pretty much we look for executability and reasonableness of theproject -- whether is it ready to proceed at the time, whether the scheduleis unattainable.andP;  We may make adjustments to the budget accordingly but webasically are looking to make sure the programs are executed well.andM;If it's a new project and they have too ambitious a schedule, we slide thefunding on it.andP;  There could be other obstacles facing automated systems or wemay look at the system and decide it's not worthwhile or that it's competingwith other national defense needs.andP;  So it may warrant cutting the entiresystem out.andM;GCN: Part of the III is the establishment of a new standard and series jobclassification for IRM professionals that would integrate the variousdisciplines of IRM.andP;  How is that effort proceeding?andM;KENDALL: That effort is part of the overall industry interface initiative.andO;We need to compete with the private sector in recruiting and retaininginformation systems professionals.andM;You may know already we have submitted to the Office of Personnel Managementan information systems manager classification standard last February.andM;GCN: Have you had any answer yet?andM;KENDALL:  They have not yet approved it, but OPM has suggested we look intousing management series 301 to address our immediate problem.andP;  In a sense itwould be a temporary measure until such time as OPM approves our informationsystems classification.andM;To us it's not the final solution.andP;  We would really like OPM to approve ournew classification series.andM;GCN: How would this management series 301 affect DOD computer users?andM;KENDALL: We are hoping to attract more qualified people and also let themknow that they are very important to us.andP;  We can go along with the computerspecialist series that we have now.andP;  Nothing's coming to a stop, but we feelthat we need to do a better job of recruiting and enhancing the careers ofpeople.andM;GCN: Will it offer them more flexibility in their work?andM;KENDALL: That's one of the things we're looking into.andP;  Whether 301 will solveour problem and ensure more money is also another issue.andM;Our biggest problem is competing with private industry salaries.andM;GCN: Can you tell me about the DOD's standardization programs?andM;KENDALL: The III raises this issue of interoperability and the DOD'srelationship to industry.andP;  We've got to address interoperability within thedepartment.andP;  [Deputy Defense secretary William H.]  Taft's memo of July 11 toall the ASDs [assistant Defense secretaries] and USDs [undersecretaries ofDefense] asked them to look into their own functional areas to come up withan interoperability and standards plan.andP;  We have received a plan from eachaddressee and we're reviewing them now before we decide what will be done.andM;For example, the health affairs area runs across all the services.andP;  Theyshould be using standard procedures for registration, prescriptions andrecords.andP;  We are looking at functionality across the services to help healthaffairs develop standards to be used by all three services.andM;GCN: Where would these standards come from?andM;KENDALL: We are asking the ASDs and USDs to come up with plan of what kindsof things make sense.andP;  This interoperability question is at a higher levelthan software standards.andM;GCN: We've talked about interoperability standards, but the III also calledfor closer involvement in the development of commercial computer standards.andO;What are you doing in that area?andM;KENDALL: It's an area that we are trying to play a much stronger role in interms of participating in organizations outside of the Department of Defensesince the Department of Defense is one of the largest users of ADP.andP;  We wantto be involved in the establishment of the standards.andP;  To date we've had afairly small staff but we are trying to become more involved.andP;  We have beeninvolved all along but we are putting a little more emphasis in that area asa part of this initiative.andM;GCN: The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency recently formed anemergency response team to deal with threats to computer networks.andP;  Are youconsidering adopting anything like that?andM;KENDALL: The ASD(C3I) [assistant secretary of Defense for command, control,communications and intelligence] handles these issues, and in particular thevirus question.andP;  So they have to be in on that issue.andM;I don't know if they have any plans for DOD.andP;  I know they have been involvedwith that and they've been following it.andM;GCN: There are a lot of women in key government positions.andP;  Constance Hornerheads OPM.andP;  One of the top persons in the ASD(C31) office is Diane Fountaine.andO;Is that at all significant and is this a growing trend?andM;KENDALL: I think government is finally -- how should I say this? --andO;government is recognizing talent within the departments and promoting thepeople who deserve to be promoted.andP;  I know there is a move to promote femalesper se but I am very hopeful that any females promoted are also qualified forthe job.andP;  I think that's a prerequisite.andP;  And I think it is good that we areseeing so many females attaining higher-level positions.andM;GCN: What are the chances of your getting transferred out with the newadministration?andM;KENDALL: None.andP;  I'm career, not political, so I don't anticipate any changesaffecting me personally.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
