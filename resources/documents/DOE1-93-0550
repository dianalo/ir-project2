Such an explosionwould also reduce production and raise prices, but in a far less gradualfashion. This change in oil policy - whether gradual or through abruptchange of family leadership - seems to the authors the most likely threatto oil supplies in the 1980s. If so, the only strategy for assuring accessto energy supplies is for the United States to rededicate itself to developmentof domestic energy resources, especially its immense natural gas reserves,which can provide an immediate and price competitive alternative to importedoil. The politics of deregulating natural gas will not be easy, but ifthere is a critical link between energy and national security, then dutyrequires that the nation face the challenge.</TEXT></DOC>
