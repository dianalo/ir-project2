The long-simmering feud resurfaced Thursday at a House hearingwhen the panel chairman said nine states with polluting electricutilities refuse to pay a disproportionate share of the cleanupcosts.   ``We are talking about economic justice for the country,'' Rep.Philip R. Sharp, chairman of the Energy and Commerce energy andpower subcommittee, said on behalf of the nine states that want thewhole country to help pay the bill.   Sharp said the nine states have utilities that burn high-sulfurcoal accounting for 50 percent of the acid rain, but their electricratepayers would be required _ under most clean air proposals _ tobear 67 percent of the cleanup cost.   Lawmakers from other states countered that their constituentsalready are paying for power plant cleanups in their own areas, andwon't pay again to clean up polluting utilities elsewhere.   The dispute could become more important than ever in the comingmonths as lawmakers and President Bush search for a formula thatwill break a decade-long deadlock over new clean air legislation.   ``The other 41 states have cleaned up their act,'' said Rep.Carlos J. Moorhead, R-Calif., who said utility rates have gone upbecause of emissions reduction programs.   ``The nine states have the cheapest rates,'' Moorhead said,referring to Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana, West Virginia, Illinois,Kentucky, Missouri, Tennessee and Georgia.   Bush's clean air proposal is among those using the theory that``the polluter pays,'' meaning the states burning dirty coal shouldpay the cost.   United Mine Workers of America President Richard L. Trumkapleaded for cost-sharing. Otherwise, he said, the most affectedutilities would simply switch fuels and leave up to 30,000 miners ofhigh-sulfur coal out of work, because the demand for their productwould drop.   Richard E. Ayres, chairman of the National Clean Air Coalition ofenvironmental, health and labor groups, said, ``With strongarguments on both sides, there is probably no single right answer.''He said his organization has backed at least partial cost-sharing byregions outside the nine states.   The Edison Electric Institute recently released a report thatsaid Bush's acid rain proposal would cost ratepayers $5 billion to$7.1 billion a year over 20 years.   Most cost-sharing proposals would levy a fee on electricgeneration by fossil-fueled plants nationwide, to subsidizeinstallation of pollution-control equipment. Another possibility:make refinery and smelting plants help pay for pollution-reductionmeasures, since they also produce chemicals that become acid rain.   The Bush plan calls for a reduction of sulfur dioxide emissionsby 10 million tons by the year 2000, with a reduction of up to 5million tons in the first phase of the program, through 1995.   The cleanup burden in the first phase would fall entirely on 107utilities burning high-sulfur coal in 20 states. But after 1995,utilities that exceed their cleanup requirements could trade creditswith other utilities and with other industries.   Sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxide _ which has its own reductionschedule _ are the main components that form an acidic compound inthe atmosphere, and rain destruction on trees and lakes thousands ofmiles away. Refineries and smelting plants emit these pollutantsalso, although certain coal-burning utilities are the main culprits.</TEXT></DOC>
