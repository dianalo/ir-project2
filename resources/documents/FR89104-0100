Chapter 35): to establish government-wide policiesthat reduce the Federal paperwork burden; to enhance the appropriate applicationof information technology; to develop and implement uniform and consistentinformation resources management policies; and to oversee the developmentof information management principles, standards, and guidelines and topromote their use.In the 1986 amendments to the Paperwork Reduction Act, Congress insertedthe term ``dissemination'' at several places in the law, noting in thelegislative history that dissemination is a key information managementarea not specified in the original Act but increasingly important in recentyears. The report of the Senate Committee on Government Affairs stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">Management of the Federal Government's information resources includesall stages of information management and all types of information technology.* * * Such management also includes planning and organizing for the efficientand coordinated collection, and use and dissemination of information, andproperly training employees to carry out such tasks. (Senate Committeeon Governmental Affairs, Report on Federal Management Reorganization andCost Control Act of 1986, 99th Congress, Report No. 99-347, July 31, 1986.)</ITAG>In December 1985, OMB issued OMB Circular No. A-130, Management of FederalInformation Resources (50 Federal Register 52730-52751, December 24, 1985),which provided a general policy framework for the management of Federalinformation resources. The Circular contained a number of policy statementsconcerning the collection and dissemination of information (see OMB CircularNo. A-130, Section 8a, and Appendix IV, Section 3).OMB further addressed information collection issues with the publication,on August 7, 1987, of a Notice of Policy Guidance on Electronic Collectionof Information (52 Federal Register 29454-29457). OMB's summary of commentsreceived is available at the address listed above.In response to interest on the part of Congress, the agencies, and thepublic, OMB has determined that there is need for additional guidance regardingthe collection and dissemination of information by Federal agencies. Thepresent notice solicits public comment on development of proposed furtherinformation dissemination policy. This notice will be revised in the lightof comments received and, incorporated into OMB Circular No. A-130.In addition to requesting comment on the substance of the notice's Policyand Analysis of Policy, OMB solicits views on the following questions:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">_Are the policy and accompanying analysis sufficiently comprehensive?Are there other major topics pertaining to information dissemination thatshould be treated?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">_Is the procedural guidance provided sufficient to ensure enforcementof the policies? More broadly, how should OMB ensure enforcement of thepolicies?<ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Policy</ITAG>Management and Information DisseminationAgencies manage the dissemination of information in the same sense thatthey manage any other legitimate agency function: they carry out policiesand procedures to ensure that the function is discharged efficiently andeffectively in accordance with applicable laws. An integral part of informationdissemination management is ensuring that the agency applies modern informationtechnology to the dissemination function.As OMB Circular No. A-130, Appendix IV, points out, an agency's obligationto disseminate information must be discharged within a responsible managementframework of minimizing costs while maximizing the usefulness of the information.Efficient, effective, and economical dissemination does not translate intodiminishing or limiting the flow of information from the agency to thepublic. To the contrary, good management of information resources shouldresult in more useful information flowing with greater facility to thepublic, at less cost to the taxpayer.Incorporation of OMB Circular No. A-3Section 1108 of Title 44 U.S.C. states in part:<ITAG tagnum="21">The head of an executive department, independent agency or establishmentof the Government, with the approval of the Director of the Office of Managementand Budget, may use from the appropriations available for printing andbinding such sums as are necessary for the printing of journals, magazines,periodicals, and similar publications he certifies in writing to be necessaryin the transaction of the public business required by law of the department,office, or establishment.</ITAG>OMB Circular No. A-3, Government Publications, implements this provisionby requiring that each agency maintain and implement an OMB approved publicationscontrol system, and prepare an annual report on periodicals and nonrecurringpublications.Because government publications are a form of information dissemination,and in order to integrate information policy as much as possible, OMB proposesto revise herewith Circular No. A-3, to incorporate the revised Circularinto OMB Circular No. A-130, and to rescind Circular No. A-3. Whereas CircularNo. A-3 covered only periodicals and nonrecurring publications, i.e., printedproducts, the proposed policy covers all information dissemination products_printedas well as electronic, with the sole exclusion of audiovisual products.Audiovisual products continue to be covered by OMB Circular No. A-114,Management of Federal Audiovisual Activities. Hence, the proposed policyapplies to products such as periodicals and nonrecurring publications whatevertheir medium of dissemination, whether micrographics, machine-readabledata files, software files, CD-ROMs (compact disks_read-only memory), electronicbulletin boards, or online information services.The definitions of the terms ``periodical'' and ``nonrecurring publication''have been incorporated from OMB Circular No. A-3, with some modifications.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">_Circular No. A-3 defines these terms simply as publications issuedby an agency; hence, it may include publications strictly internal to anagency. The definition in the proposed policy clarifies that the termsrefer to documents disseminated or routinely made available to the public.OMB introduces this change because the focus of dissemination is on informationdistributed to the public, and because the concept of internal publicationis difficult to define in practice.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">_The definition of periodical in Circular A-3 excluded ``primarily(90 percent or more) statistical materials.'' The proposed policy dropsthis exclusion; such materials would now be considered periodicals. Thereason is that there is nothing intrinsic to primarily statistical materialsthat should cause them to be exempt from routine management controls. Historically,statistical materials were excluded with the intent of guarding againsttampering with Federal statistics. OMB agrees that agencies must erectsafeguards so that Federal statistics will not be tampered with. However,the safeguards ought not to mean omission of statistical publications,from routine management controls such as inventory and reporting.Many agencies appear not to know what publications or databases they maybe issuing, how decisions are made to disseminate information disseminationproducts, or how much they cost. The policy first requires management controlsystems, a requirement carried over from Circular No. A-3, and specifiessome minimal functions the control systems are to perform. The purposeof the control systems is to ensure that sound management practices arefollowed in managing dissemination. If an agency's information disseminationresponsibilities, as determined by the agency head within the context ofthe agency's mission and the OMB policy framework, call for an aggressiveinformation dissemination outreach program, then the control system isa management tool for ensuring that the agency achieves and maintains sucha program. Similarly, if the agency's information dissemination responsibilitiesare quite limited, the control system is a tool for ensuring that the agencycontinues to use public resources only for those activities necessary forthe proper performance of agency functions.One function of the control system is establishing and maintaining comprehensiveinventories of the information dissemination products they disseminate.The rationale for requiring inventories is primarily that agenciescannotmanage the dissemination function if they do not know what informationproducts they have to disseminate, and that an inventory is an essentialtool for managing the function. A corollary is that agencies can betterserve their public information needs with current comprehensive inventoriesthat can be used as finders' aids for locating information disseminatedby the agencies.OMB issues an annual bulletin instructing agencies to report on informationdissemination products. Agencies should maintain the information soughtin the annual OMB bulletin in their inventories. In addition, agenciesshould make use of their inventories for other management purposes. Forexample, agencies may wish to add keywords and abstracts in order to makethe inventories more useful as finders' aids for locating information theydisseminate. While agencies should be responsive to the public's requestsfor assistance in locating information, the agencies should bear in mindthat private firms also provide government information locator services,and avoid offering information services that essentially duplicate servicesalready available.The proposed policy next states the general policy for periodicals thatis based directly on 44 U.S.C. 1108, and is taken verbatim from OMB CircularNo. A-3.The proposed policy also continues the annual reporting and approval provisionsfound in OMB Circular No. A-3.Adequate NoticeCircular No. A-130 states that ``agencies shall disseminate significantnew, or terminate significant existing, information dissemination productsonly after providing adequate notice to the public.'' (Section 8a) TheCircular contained no procedural guidance for, nor any provisions for enforcing,the adequate notice policy. It left to the agencies the determinationsas to what was a significant information dissemination product and whatconstitutes adequate notice. Nearly three years' experience with the Circularindicates that most agencies in fact have not made these determinations,nor have they established procedures for ensuring that adequate noticeis given. During that period the public has brought to OMB's attentioninstances in which some form of advance public notice might reasonablyhave been expected under the policy, but no notice was given. Therefore,OMB is proposing additional guidance concerning adequate notice.<T3>Significant information dissemination products.</T3> OMB's intent inCircular No. A-130 was that agencies would designate certain kinds of informationdissemination products as significant, meaning that the decision to initiate,terminate, or substantially modify the content, form, or availability ofsuch products should trigger a form of public notice in advance of actualinitiation, termination, or modification. Other products deemed not tobe significant require no advance notice.Examples of nonsignificant products might be those that:<ITAG tagnum="15">_From the outset, were </ITAG><T3>never intended to be continuing</T3>; hence, most nonrecurring, one-timepublications.<ITAG tagnum="15">_Are </ITAG><T3>Generally considered ephemeral </T3>such as brochures, handbills, flyers,pamphlets, and the like;<ITAG tagnum="15">_Receive </ITAG><T3>Little expression of public interest </T3>as evidenced by the lackof or decline in subscriptions, sales, or requests for copies.Examples of significant products might be those that:<ITAG tagnum="15">_are </ITAG><T3>required by law</T3>; e.g., a statutorily mandated report to Congress;<ITAG tagnum="15">_Involved expenditure of </ITAG><T3>substantial funds </T3>for the dissemination; a dollar threshold mightbe appropriate here;<ITAG tagnum="15">_By reason of the </ITAG><T3>nature of the information</T3>, are matters of continuing public interest;e.g., a key economic indicator;<ITAG tagnum="15">_By reason of the </ITAG><T3>timeliness of the information</T3>, command public interest; e.g.,monthly crop reports on the day of their release;<ITAG tagnum="15">_Disseminate in a </ITAG><T3>new medium</T3>; e.g., disseminating a printed product in electronicmedium, or disseminating a machine-readable data file via online access;<ITAG tagnum="15">_Have already received (or will receive) </ITAG><T3>substantial expression of public interest</T3>; e.g., those that have(or can expect) regular followings or subscribers;<ITAG tagnum="15">_May reasonably be viewed as </ITAG><T3>duplicating and/or competing with existing products </T3>disseminatedby other agencies or private sector firms; e.g., a value-added electronicdatabase product.<T3>Form of Notice. </T3>Similarly, agencies must determine what form anotice should take in a given case. Several forms of notice suggest themselves.<ITAG tagnum="15">_</ITAG><T3>Oral public announcements </T3>at meetings, conferences, and conventionsattended by users or potential users of the product;<ITAG tagnum="15">_</ITAG><T3>Written public announcements</T3> in periodicals and other publicationscirculated to users or potential users;<ITAG tagnum="15">_</ITAG><T3>Letters </T3>to subscribers or potential subscribers;<ITAG tagnum="15">_</ITAG><T3>Notices </T3>with or without request for comment in the <T3>Federal Register </T3>or <T3>Commerce Business Daily</T3>; or<ITAG tagnum="15">_</ITAG><T3>Public hearings</T3> convened for the purpose of discussing initiationor termination.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">These forms of notice involve different levels of effort and expenseon the part of the agency, and agencies should choose a level proportionalto the significance of the product and the action being proposed.Determination of significance and adequate notice are matters of agencyjudgment. The key point is that agencies must make the judgments and actupon them. When initiating or terminating an information disseminationproduct, the agency has an obligation to assess and take account of theimpact of its action upon the public. Where members of the public considera proposed new agency product unnecessary and duplicative, the agency shouldfind out, in advance of initiating the product, why they think this andwhether the agency should reconsider a decision to initiate. Where membersof the public consider an existing agency product important and necessary,the agency should find out, in advance of terminating or curtailing theproduct, why they think this and whether the agency should reconsider itsdecision.Moreover, members of the public should be able to seek reconsiderationor redress from agencies when they believe agencies have acted capriciouslywith respect to initiating or terminating information dissemination products.Agency procedures should include mechanisms for responding to the contingencythat agency actions may violate the adequate notice policy, and for howthe agency will rectify the violation.In order to ensure that agencies in fact develop the necessary procedures,the proposed policy requries that agencies report the procedures to OMB.Electronic DisseminationThe range of available information dissemination media expands as technologycontinues to develop. Yesterday's monthly index to scientific literatureis today's online information service; yesterday's newsletter is today'selectronic bulletin board; yesterday's magnetic tape is today's floppydisk or online database and tomorrow's CD-ROM. Part of managing the informationdissemination function, therefore, is the responsibility to scrutinizeregularly the media of dissemination in order to determine whether themedium in use continues to be the most appropriate.The decision to disseminate information electronically in many respectsis identical to the decision to disseminate information in any other medium.Agencies must ask themselves the questions:<ITAG tagnum="15">_Is dissemination of this information dissemination product requiredby law?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Is dissemination of this information dissemination product necessaryfor the proper performance of agency functions?</ITAG>At the present time, electronic dissemination more often than not is anagency`s secondary issuance of the product, the primary having been insome conventional paper format (press release, report, etc.). Where thisis the case, electronic dissemination is more discretionary than the primaryissuance, and agencies may wish to consider additional conditions beforedeciding for electronic dissemination. The policy statement lists conditionsfavorable to electronic dissemination.While electronic products are more frequently the secondary mode of informationdissemination, agencies must recognize that this condition is changing.Integration of information technology into the workplace is rapidly reachingthe point that both internal agency processing and analysis of informationas well as the public's use of information often occur primarily in electronicform. Supplying the information on paper is sometimes practically useless,particularly when the volume of information is large and computer searchand retrieval capabilities are essential to efficient use. Moreover, theprinted product is often a summary or aggregation of the larger body ofinformation which, although useful in its own right, does not satisfy alllegitimate user needs as well as the entire body of information in electronicmedium. Under these conditions, an agency might reasonably conclude thatdissemination in electronic medium is necessary for the proper performanceof agency functions. A basic purpose of the Paperwork Reduction Act is ``to maximize the usefulnessof information collected, maintained, and disseminated by the Federal Government.''(44 U.S.C. 3501) Thus, dissemination in electronic media is often highlydesirable because, under certain assumptions, the electronic informationdissemination product is substantially more useful. Electronic informationdissemination products tend to contain more information_often an exactand complete copy of a government electronic database, and to present theinformation in a format that is more manipulable by the user, and hencemore conducive to tailoring to a wide variety of user needs. Agencies canfrequently enhance the value of government information as a national resourceand increase its usefulness by disseminating information in electronicmedia. At the same time, it bears remembering that electronic dissemination isnot applicable in all cases. Everyone in the public likely to be interestedin the information may not be computer-literate or have access to informationtechnology. Dissemination in the electronic media alone may render theinformation inaccessible to such users. Similarly, some government informationholdings evoke little or no public interest and are not in demand, evenwhen the public is well informed about what the holdings are. Absent statutoryor mission mandates, any dissemination, let alone electronic, is of questionableutility in such cases. As Circular No. A-130 notes, the fact that an agency has created or collectedinformation is not itself a valid reason for creating a program, product,or service to disseminate the information to the public. By the same token,the fact that an agency is capable of offering an information service isnot itself a valid reason for offering the service. Agencies should avoidoffering dissemination services they know (or should know) to be availablein the marketplace. An agency, for example, may have the capability tooffer dial-up online access to its databases, but the same capability mayalso be available from private firms that purchase the agency's databases.For the agency to offer the service will always entail some cost to thegovernment, and the availability of virtually identical services from privatefirms is a compelling argument against the need for the government to offerthe service. While electronic dissemination is generally desirable, agencies must observecertain boundaries on such activities. As a rule of thumb, Federal agenciesshould take it as a rebuttable presumption that they are to concentratedissemination activities on supplying basic information, the provisionof which is unique to the government, and to avoid offering value-addedproducts to end users. That is, given a choice between expending resourceson disseminating more government information in forms that are usable forgeneral purposes and expending resources on tailoring fewer informationdissemination products to specific user needs, agencies should presumethey are to choose the former. In effect, agencies should prefer to ``wholesale''government information and leave ``retail,'' value-added functions to theprivate sector, especially when they know that the private sector is readyand able to perform the value-added functions. Indeed, the existence ofa private sector, value-added provider is presumptive evidence that, barringextenuating circumstances such as urgent public policy considerations ordistorted market forces, the Federal agency need not expend public fundsto provide the value-added service. For example, many agencies are currently planning to issue large databaseson CD-ROMs, suitable for processing on microcomputers, and the questionarises as to whether the agencies should include on the CD-ROMs the search-and-retrievalsoftware necessary to access the databases. OMB's view is that the agenciesshould disseminate CD-ROMs that contain only the databases and should notinclude the software. The first reason for this view is that, as CircularNo. A-130 has already noted and the General Accounting Office has frequentlypointed out, the practice of developing and maintaining customized computersoftware is a source of inefficiency in Federal agencies. While the softwaremay make the CD-ROMs more readily accessible by users, its developmentand maintenance also represent a costly diversion of agency resources,because software development by and large is not part of agencies' informationdissemination mandates. The second reason is that the software developmentis a value-added feature that can be performed by the private sector, andhence a commercial activity that the government neither needs to nor shouldperform itself. Agencies might better devote their resources to improvingthe databases themselves or to preparing other databases for dissemination,for these are tasks that only the agencies can perform. Circular No. A-130 counsels agencies, when using contractors for carryingout dissemination activities, to ensure that contractors are not permittedto exercise monopolistic controls over government information resources.By the same token, agencies themselves must avoid behaving in a monopolisticfashion with respect to their information dissemination products. For example,an agency that sells online access to its databases but refuses to sellcopies of the databases themselves may be presumed to be behaving as amonopolist because its practice precludes the possibility of a competitorselling the same service at a lower price. If an agency is willing to providepublic access to a database, the agency should be willing to sell copiesof the database itself. By the same reasoning, agencies should behave in an even-handed mannerin disseminating information products. If an agency is willing to sella database or database services to some members of the public, the agencyshould in principle be prepared to sell the same products under similarterms to other members of the public, absent a statutory basis for actingotherwise. While an agency may have public policy reasons for offeringdifferent terms of sale to different groups in the public, the agency shouldprovide a clear statement as to its reasons and their basis.User Charges OMB Circular No. A-25, User Charges, (proposed revision published in 52<T4>Federal Register </T4>24890, July 1, 1987) implements Title 5 of theIndependent Offices Appropriations Act of 1952 (31 U.S.C. 9701), establishingFederal policy regarding fees assessed for government services and forsale or use of government property or resources. The general policy statedin Circular No. A-25 (Section 6) is that a user charge will be assessedagainst each identifiable recipient for benefits derived from Federal activitiesbeyond those received by the general public. As Circular No. A-130 notes, the Federal Government possesses much informationof substantial commercial value. Dissemination of such information, orits dissemination in a specific form or medium, may represent a governmentservice from which identifiable recipients derive special benefits, inwhich case user charges may be applicable. Many agencies that have substantialinformation dissemination programs continue not to have consistent, agency-widepolicies and procedures for setting user charges for information disseminationproducts. The proposed policy provides that agencies must establish usercharges for the costs of disseminating these products, and recover suchcosts, where appropriate. At present, Chapter 17 of Title 44, U.S. Code, reserves to the Public Printerand the Superintendent of Documents the pricing and sale of printed governmentdocuments. In practice, therefore, executive agency discretion in the settingof user charges for information dissemination products is limited to thosethat are not printed, i.e., principally to electronic products. Circular No. A-130 stated that agencies shall recover only costs of disseminatinginformation products through user charges, where appropriate, in accordancewith Circular No. A-25. Circular No. A-130 also balanced the requirementto establish user charges against the need to ensure that government informationdissemination products reach the public for whom they are intended. (Section8a(11)(a)) ``If an agency has a positive obligation to place a given productor service in the hands of certain specific groups or members of the publicand also determines that user charges will constitute a significant barrierto discharging this obligation, the agency may have grounds for reducingor eliminating its user charges for the product or service, or for exemptingsome receipients from the charge'' (Appendix IV). The Circular gave nofurther guidance as to how agencies should balance these requirements.Circular No. A-25 also establishes that user charges should be set at alevel sufficient to recover the full cost of providing the service, resource,or property. The proposed policy clarifies the application of CircularNo. A-25 to information dissemination products. Absent statutory requirementsto the contrary, the standard for user charges for information disseminationproducts should be to recover no more than the full cost of dissemination.OMB's proposed revision to Circular No. A-25 makes a distinction (in Section6a(2)(b)) between user charges when the Government is acting as propertyowner and when the Government is acting as sovereign. In the former caseuser charges will be based on market prices, and in the latter on fullcost. For all instances in which the Government itself creates or collectsinformation, or causes creation or collection through sponsorship, theGovernment is acting as sovereign. User charges the Government may assessfor products resulting from such creation or collection should be no greaterthan the full cost of dissemination.The proposed policy, therefore, treats information products as differentfrom other goods and services with respect to user charges. First, statutessuch as the Freedom of Information Act and the Government in the SunshineAct establish that Federal agencies have a broad and general obligationto make government information available to the public and to avoid erectingbarriers that impede public access. Circular No. A-130 continues this traditionwith its Basic Considerations and Assumptions (Section 7), and with thepolicy balancing user charges against reaching the intended public. Usercharges higher than the cost of dissemination are a barrier to public access.Second, given that the Government has sunk the costs of creating and processingthe information for governmental purposes, the economic benefit to societyis maximized when the information is publicly disseminated at the costof dissemination.The full cost of dissemination may generally be thought of as the sum ofall costs specifically associated with preparing for public disseminationand actually disseminating to the public. For example, an agency may preparean information product for its own internal use, and costs associated withsuch production are not recoverable as user charges. When the agency takesthe product, prepares it for public dissemination, and actually disseminatesit, costs associated with preparation and actual dissemination are recoverableas user charges.While the proposed policy generally limits user charges to the cost ofdissemination, agencies should take care to set charges at the full costof dissemination, where appropriate. Some agencies apparently limit usercharges for information dissemination products, for example, to the costsof reproducing and distributing computer tapes without enunciating a rationalefor such limitations. In fact, recoverable costs may be signficantly higher.For example, for an online database service, recoverable cost elementsmight include personnel, materials, and services associated with the following:telecommunications between the computer system and user terminals; computerusage, online network management; training of personnel operating onlineservices; preparation and distribution of manuals and training materials;and accounting and billing for online services. Cost elements might alsoinclude associated administrative overhead costs such as printing, postage,travel, and indirect costs.In addition, OMB Circular No. A-25 provides for charges for governmentgoods and services that convey special benefits to recipients beyond thoseaccruing to the general public. Where agencies provide custom tailoredinformation services to specific individuals or groups, full cost recoveryfor such services is appropriate. For example, if an agency prepares specialtabulations or similar services from its databases in answer to a specificrequest from a member of the public, all costs associated with fulfillingthe request would be charged, and the requester would be so informed beforework was begun. In a few cases agencies engaging in information collectionactivities augment the information collection at the request of, and withfunds provided by, private sector groups. Since the 1920s, the Bureau ofthe Census has carried out surveys of certain industries at greater frequencyor at a greater level of detail than Federal funding would permit, becauseindustry groups have requested more frequent or detailed government dataand have paid the additional information collection and processing costs,and the additional information is consistent with Federal purposes. Whileresults of these surveys are disseminated to the public at cost of dissemination,the existence and availability of the additional government data are specialbenefits to certain recipients beyond those accruing to the public. Itis appropriate that those recipients should bear full costs of informationcollection and processing, as well as dissemination.At the same time, as Circular No. A-130 points out, the requirement toestablish user charges is not intended to make the ability to pay the solecriterion for determining whether the public receives government information.Agencies must balance the requirement to establish user charges and thelevel of fees charged against other policies, specifically, the properperformance of agency functions and the need to ensure that informationdissemination products reach the public for whom they are intended (seeOMB Circular No. A-130, section 8a(11)(a)). If an agency has a positiveobligation to place a given product in the hands of certain specific groupsor members of the public and also determines that user charges will constitutea significant barrier to discharging this obligation, the agency may havegrounds for reducing or eliminating its user charges for the product, orfor exempting some recipients from the charge. Such reductions or eliminationsshould be the subject of formal agency determinations on a case by casebasis and justified in terms of clearcut agency policies.Small AgenciesThe foregoing discussion and proposed policy are written with a view toagencies that have sizable multimedia information dissemination programs.Not all agencies are large, nor have such programs. Formal management controlsystems, adequate notice procedures, and the administration of electronicinformation dissemination may be inappropriate for small agencies. Thepolicies themselves, however, are appropriate for all agencies. Smalleragencies should implement the policies with procedures appropriate fortheir size.<ITAG tagnum="6">James B.
