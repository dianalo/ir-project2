The Teamsters, on strike since Oct. 3, were scheduled to vote onthe three-year contract this afternoon. If approved, the 2,100studio drivers represented by the local could return to work at thebeginning of next week.   Results of the balloting were expected late tonight or Friday,officials said.   It also was disclosed Wednesday that 600 members of the LaborersUnion settled their strike with the producers and will return towork Monday.   And representatives of about 100 striking studio electricianswere reported to have concluded their negotiations with theproducers late Wednesday and also are supposed to vote today ontheir pact.   At a news conference to announce the settlement, Bush showedobvious displeasure over the agreement in the Teamsters strike andrefused to say whether he would recommend it to union members.   ``I can recommend that it's time to end the strike or alockout,'' Bush said. ``That's a lot different than recommendingthat this package is good or recommending to the members that theyshould be accepting on the terms of the package.''   Neither Bush nor Nicholas Counter III, president of the Allianceof Motion Picture and Television Producers, would give details ofthe pact. But a source told the Los Angeles Times that union lost ona major issue in the strike, new rules for overtime.   Under the new contract, a driver will only be paid overtime onSaturday or Sunday if working on those days means putting in morethan 40 hours a week, the source told The Times. Previously, driverswere paid overtime for all weekend work.   The agreement also would give most drivers 45-cent-an-hour wageincreases for each of the next three years, the newspaper reported.The basic driver's wage under the current contract is $16.61 an hour.   The studios have used replacement drivers during the strike, butthe Teamsters are expected to get their jobs back, the Times said.</TEXT></DOC>
