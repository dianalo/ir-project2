In the presence of either cationic micelles oranionic micelles, a remarkable increase in the accumulation of the reducedform of viologen was observed. The existence of the micelles depressedboth the quenching rate of the photoexcited Zn-TPPS/sub 3//sup 3-/ byviologen and the back reaction rate, recombination rate of the oxidizedZn-TPPS/sub 3//sup 3-/ and reduced viologen. Compared with both reactions,it was clarified that the recombination rate strongly influenced theviologen reduction rate. The effect of the micelles was explained bythe electrostatic effect among the charges of the micellar surface, Zn-TPPS/sub3//sup 3-/ and viologen. By the addition of colloidal platinum to thesystem, photoinduced hydrogen evolution was also studied.</TEXT></DOC>
