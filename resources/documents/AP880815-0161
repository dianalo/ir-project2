Most of the 106 members of the Platform Committee shouted anenthusiastic approval to the 40,000-word document, which will bepresented to the full convention Tuesday. Thhe only ``no'' voteswere cast by Connecticut's two platform committee members, Sen.Lowell P. Weicker Jr. and Mary Boatwright.   After the voice vote, Weicker demanded a show of hands but itwas curtailed without a formal count after Sen. Bob Kasten ofWisconsin, the co-chairman, looked at all the arms raised insupport of the platform.   There were no minority reports, which means there will be nodebate on the convention floor Tuesday over any of the planks.   The platform, ``An American Vision: For Our Children and OurFuture,'' includes a firm pledge against tax increases, calls for``rapid and certain deployment'' of the Strategic DefenseInitiative and seeks a Constitutional amendment against abortion.It skewers the Democrats on ethics and promotes George Bush'spositions in favor of a child-care tax credit and increasededucation spending.   New Jersey Assembly Speaker Chuck Hardwick, a co-chair of thepanel, said, ``I think we have a platform here that's not onlyconcervative but it's compassionate. It's compassionate becauseit's dealing with so many of the problems that are current in 1988_ problems of the environment, of children, of health care, ofbuilding for a better America.''   Nebraksa Gov. Kay Orr, chairwoman of the Platform Committee,missed her final committee session to attend a luncheon honoringNancy Reagan.   The GOP platform is roughly eight times longer than the5,200-word, streamlined document that the Democrats approved inAtlanta last month.   Rep. Jerry Lewis of California, a co-chairman, said the GOPdocument was ``a substantive piece of work,'' unlike the Democrats'``flight of fancy.''   Kasten said afterwards, ``The Democrats gave us a little bit ofan opening. It's kind of unusual that they decided to be so vagueand almost kind of bragged about it. ... We have seen this as anopportunity to become the party in which ideas have consequences.''   ``This platform will be looked upon as a tool for George Bushand Republican candidates to run upon,'' Kasten said.   Weicker said he was against the platform both for ``what's in it... (and) what's not in it.''   He said the document fell short on civil rights, AIDS, socialjustice and other issues, and ``we certainly don't do any favorsfor women.''   Weicker, the most liberal GOP senator, added, ``I'm against theDemocratic platform because it didn't say anything, and I'm againstthe Republican platform because it says too much.''   Boatwright, a GOP national committeewoman from Stonington,Conn., stayed for the meeting despite an injury to her left legcaused by an escalator mishap. She said she was riding up anescalator at the Hilton Hotel ``and somebody dropped a whole bunchof boxes. They got stuck at the top of the escalator. And Icouldn't get off so I fell over them.''   She said the platform was ``a little bit more conservative thanour constituency in Connecticut feels.'' She delayed a trip to ahospital for stitches because ``I certainly didn't want my senatorto vote alone.''   Weicker, who lost attempts last Wednesday to liberalize theplatform's planks on abortion, AIDS and disability issues, said,``It was a fair hearing. I took my licks and gave a few. That's thewhole process in this country. So, I'm not complaining, but neitheram I voting for it.''</TEXT></DOC>
