(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Secretary of State Gentry Crowell, whoseoffice has been at the center of a federal investigation ofcorruption, has died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.   Crowell, 57, died Wednesday at Vanderbilt University MedicalCenter. He never regained consciousness after he shot himself inthe head Dec. 12.   ``He essentially was found to have no brain function,'' said Dr.Joseph Ross, associate vice chancellor for medical affairs atVanderbilt. Tests Wednesday showed little blood flow to Crowell'sbrain and doctors decided to remove him from life-support systems,Ross said.   The suicide was the second by a state Democratic official duringa statewide federal investigation of public corruption.   Crowell's office has been a focus of an investigation that hasresulted in 25 people being indicted. Crowell twice testifiedbefore federal grand juries, although he said he had been assuredhe would not be indicted.   Federal authorities investigating illegal bingo gambling andpublic corruption reportedly had been closing in on Crowell.Investigators reportedly were focusing on how Crowell solicitedpolitical campaign money from architects, engineers and bingooperators.   As a result of the investigation, a one-time Crowell employee,former chief bingo inspector W.D. ``Donnie'' Walker, is serving aseven-year prison sentence on a conviction that includes extortingpayoffs from bingo operators.   Crowell's longtime administrative assistant, Mary Sue Wright,was named an unindicted co-conspirator in an illegally operatedMemphis bingo hall and given immunity from prosecution.   The secretary's death followed by five months the suicide inKnoxville of Ted Ray Miller, a state representative who reportedlywas under investigation in connection with bribes paid inconnection with legislation dealing with a Knox County incineratorproject. Miller had not been indicted.   Crowell was elected to the Legislature in 1968, and was electedsecretary of state in 1977.</TEXT></DOC>
