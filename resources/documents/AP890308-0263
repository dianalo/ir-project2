DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Lawyers for striking Eastern Airlines machinistsargued today that a federal judge improperly barred railroad workersfrom honoring picket lines that could close down Amtrak and NewYork's commuter railroads.   The order by U.S. District Judge Robert P. Patterson ``violatedthe clear command of the Norris-LaGuardia Act,'' Joseph GuerrieriJr., lawyer for the machinists, told the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court ofAppeals.   That law says federal courts cannot issue injunctions in labordisputes, except in cross-industry secondary strikes.   Patterson ``was wrong in enjoining unions from engaging insecondary boycotts,'' said Guerrieri. ``The unions are free toengage in a full range of secondary activities.''   Patterson on Tuesday extended until midnight Friday his temporaryorders barring strikes at Amtrak and New York's commuter railroadsin sympathy with the Eastern Airlines walkout. He scheduled ahearing for today on whether to issue a long-term ban on sympathystrikes.   An aide said the judge extended his temporary orders _ whichwould have expired at 3 p.m. today _ to allow himself time to rule.   Before Patterson's hearing, the appeals court heard an appeal bythe International Association of Machinists and the Brotherhood ofRailroad Signalmen of his temporary order.   The IAM has said it may set up picket lines at the railroads, andrail workers' unions have said they would honor such lines. Thatcould severely disrupt rail transit.   The unions asked the appeals court to consolidate the threelawsuits brought by the various railroads into one case and delayPatterson's restraining order or order him to throw it out.   But Bernard M. Plum, a lawyer for Metro-North Commuter Railroadand the Long Island Rail Road, argued that their employees arerequired to honor their labor contract until they have exhausted allnon-court remedies under federal railroad laws.   ``Those contracts require people to come to work every day.That's a basic obligation,'' said Plum.   Plum said that under the Railway Labor Act, ``The question isthat they first had to go to (those procedures) before it wasdetermined if they could honor picket lines.''   Appeals court Judge Irving R. Kaufman noted, ``Whatever we do,really, is meanigless because you're going to right to the SupremeCourt _ either side _ won't they?''   Plum conceded the parties probably would ``given what is atstake.''   The appeals panel, which included judges George C. Pratt andRichard J. Cardamone as well as Kaufman, said it would issue adecision later today.   Amtrak, the LIRR, Metro-North and New Jersey Transit sought andwon the temporary orders from Patterson forbidding walkouts.</TEXT></DOC>
