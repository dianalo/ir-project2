Transco said its oil and gas unit will halt onshore exploration activities and put its deep-water exploratory leases in the Gulf of Mexico on the auction block. Additionally, Transco Exploration Partners Ltd., the unit, said it is &quot;reviewing alternatives&quot; concerning its onshore producing properties. Transco owns 74% of Transco Exploration Partners.    Pipeline companies in recent years built exploration and production operations, hoping for a natural synergy with their transmission businesses. But regulatory changes have removed much of that opportunity, forcing pipelines to refocus on their core businesses.    Transco joins several other natural-gas pipeline operators, including Tenneco Inc., Enron Corp. and Coastal Corp., all based here, that have recently attempted to shed some exploration and production assets and other non-pipeline properties. Enron, which had put an estimated $2 billion in assets up for sale, recently pulled its properties from the market, unhappy with the bids it got. Coastal has said it will sell a 50% interest in its refining and marketing operations. Tenneco still has its entire oil and gas business on the block.    Transco Exploration said it will reduce corporate overhead by about $5 million and save $10 million a year in costs by mothballing its onshore explorations, which employ about 120 people in Denver, New Orleans and Houston. The onshore exploration assets include about 278,000 undeveloped acres primarily in Texas, Louisiana, California and the Rocky Mountains.    News of the restructuring pushed Transco stock up $1.50 to $33 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday. Transco Exploration closed at $6.25, down 25 cents, on the Big Board.    George S. Slocum, the parent's president and chief executive officer, said the company's &quot;basic strength&quot; lies in the &quot;sale, transportation and storage of natural gas,&quot; and that those areas will be Transco's strategic focus.    &quot;I think you'll see (Transco) selling any non-pipeline entities, and you'll see it becoming a 100% pipeline entity,&quot; said Gary Hovis, an analyst with Argus Research. Mr. Hovis said the pipeline companies are under great financial pressure and must continue to cut costs.    Transco Exploration Partners said it was selling its deep-water exploratory leases in the Gulf of Mexico, beyond the Outer Continental Shelf, because the costs and risks of exploring and developing there are &quot;substantially higher and require longer lead times&quot; than drilling inside the Outer Continental Shelf.    H.B. Juengling, an analyst with Howard Weil Financial Corp., said he thinks Transco's leases will fetch about $200 million. Those leases represent 20% of Transco's proven reserves, the company said.    Last week, Transco Energy posted a 29% drop in second-quarter net income to $3 million, or 10 cents a share, from $4.2 million, or 15 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 9% to $702 million. </TEXT></DOC>
