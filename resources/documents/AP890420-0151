The guns and rocket launchers, which by police count have firedmore than 100,000 projectiles since March 8, were mostly silent.Occasional salvos kept people on edge.   ``We'll be lucky if this lull persists and we manage to get somesleep,'' said grocer Youssef Aridi as he closed his store in Moslemwest Beirut after opening it briefly to sell what few goods he hadleft.   The latest spasm of shelling, which began at dusk Saturday,inexplicably slackened late Wednesday.   The quiet followed a cease-fire call Tuesday from 23 ChristianParliament deputies. But Gen. Michel Aoun, whose mainly Christianarmy forces have been battling an alliance of Syrian troops andMoslem Druse militiamen, rejected that call.   The leftist As-Safir daily termed the lull a ``half-truce.'' TheChristian Lebanese Broadcasting Corp. called it ``an ambigiouscease-fire.''   Whatever the reason for it, the break gave people a chance toget out of the shelters in which they've been cooped up, checktheir homes and businesses for damage and buy what food andsupplies were available.   A police spokesman, who cannot be named under standingregulations, said it was a double-edged sword.   ``It's good to give the people a breather so they can get somesleep. But it's risky as well because people might get used to itand forget the dangers of renewed shelling. That's when you getheavy casualties,'' he said.   About 200 university students demonstrated outside the U.S.Embassy in the Christian suburb of Aukar, chanting anti-Syrianslogans.   The pro-Aoun protesters brandished placards calling on the Bushadministration to help drive the Syrian army out of Lebanon.   Bush told reporters in Washington Thursday that he and otherworld leaders ``can't give up'' trying to end the violence inLebanon.   But he said the United States does not have ``great influence inLebanon with the factions that are fighting.''   By police count, at least 270 people have been killed and nearly1,000 wounded since March 8.   Among them was Spanish Ambassador Pedro Manuel de Arestigui,killed when a shell hit his house in east Beirut on Sunday. Hisbody was flown Thursday to Madrid.   The shelling duels, some of the heaviest in Lebanon's14-year-old civil war, erupted after Aoun blockaded Moslemmilitia-run ports.   Aoun, who heads the Christian Cabinet vying for power with arival Moslem government, was seeking to restore state authoritylong eroded by powerful militias.   The Druse Progressive Socialist Party, which operates twoillegal ports south of Beirut, retaliated by shelling theChristian-held Beirut port. Syrian allies, who maintain 40,000troops in Lebanon, joined and blockaded the Christians'310-square-mile coastal enclave.   More than 150,000 people have fled Beirut during earlier lullsand more, driven as much by shortages as the fear of renewedbombardment, packed up what they could Thursday and got out.   Moslem refugees have moved south for sanctuary. But theChristians have no place to hide in their enclave, every inch of itwithin range of long-range Syrian artillery.   The Christians' only exit is through the frequently shelled portof Jounieh, where ferries leave for Cyprus.   Even that escape route was in jeopardy. The two Cypriotcompanies that run the ferries suspended service after the vesselscame under Moslem rocket fire.   For those who stay behind, life has become a nightmare.   Police and army explosives experts defused 300 unexploded shellsfound in Moslem west Beirut on Thursday.   It's not known how many more lie beneath the rubble of apartmentblocks, factories, schools, hospitals and stores.   Both sides are suffering severe shortages _ fruit and vegetablesfor the Christians, who normally get their supplies from Moslemareas; bread for the Moslems, because flour warehouses are inChristian territory.   Both sides lack fuel because the main depot at Dora in eastBeirut was blown up by Syrian shellfire. The main power stationsshut down Saturday when fuel ran out for their generators.   That knocked out the water pumping system, leaving homes dry andfire crews unable to tackle burning buildings and cars set ablazein the shelling. Many people don't have water to wash off afterweeks in their shelters.   The rubble-strewn streets are littered with stinking,rat-infested piles of garbage. Municipal officials said the fuelshortage meant garbage trucks couldn't run. And anyway, they said,most of the 2,000 street cleaners have fled.   The Moslem-run Voice of the Nation reported that the French Navytanker Penhors, sent by Paris with a hospital ship on ahumanitarian mission, would unload its desperately needed cargo offuel oil within 24 hours.   The radio said one third would be unloaded at the Moslem-runpower station at Jiye, south of Beirut, and the rest at the Zoukplant in Christian territory north of the capital.   With Moslems and Christian leaders bickering over who should getthe most fuel, most Beirutis won't believe the radio report untiltheir lights come on again.</TEXT></DOC>
