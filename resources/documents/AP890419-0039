The administration was trying to determine the veracity of areport Tuesday in The Washington Post that the Nicaraguan rebelsfailed to expel a commander who was convicted of covering up amurder. The story said the rebels ignored a warning by a top StateDepartment official that they were required to take such action inorder to remain eligible for the new U.S. aid.   The new aid, the product of a March 24 bipartisan agreementbetween the administration and Congress, calls for cutoff of themoney if there are human rights abuses by the Contras.   The State Department said the Contras' own military tribunal onMarch 23 expelled six Contra members for human rights violations,including the rebels' head of intelligence, known as CommandanteMack.   But The Post, citing rebel sources, reported that Mack was stillworking at Contra headquarters despite his conviction and expulsion.   ``His attendance at any official resistance function would beforbidden under the expulsion order,'' said a State Departmentofficial, who spoke on condition of anonymity.   The official said that Commandante Mack and a regional commanderknown as Commandante Nolan both had appealed their convictions tothe Contra directorate.   Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Chris Arcos confirmedTuesday that he had made clear to the rebels during a meetingwithin the last three weeks that they were expected to remove theviolaters from their ranks.   ``Legally we would have the basis,'' to halt the aid if they didnot, Arcos said. He said the admininistration was trying to findout if the newspaper report were true.   He said the Contra military tribunal last month had convicted acommander with the nom de guerre Commandante Mack, but that theleader was seen in the Contra camps subsequent to the time heshould have been expelled.   Arcos said that he was ``reassured'' then by the Contraleadership that they did intend to expel anyone convicted of humanrights abuses, and now he was trying to find out if that hadoccurred with Commandante Mack.   Bush signed the legislation on Tuesday that will provide $49.8million in non-military aid to sustain the rebels until Nicaraguaholds elections early next year. The legislation was hammered outafter two months of negotiation between administration officialsand congressional leaders.   Bush restated his backing for a diplomatic solution in Nicaraguaafter years of a pro-military policy advanced by President Reagan.   Bush also repeated his call for the Soviet Union to help bringpeace to the region by ending its military aid to Nicaragua'sleftist government.   ``The Soviet Union must match its rhetorical support for thepeace process with concrete action to halt military aid, to endsubversion in that region and to promote genuine democracy inNicaragua,'' Bush said Monday.   In brief remarks in a Rose Garden signing ceremony, Bush wasflanked by Democratic and Republican leaders of the House andSenate.   He said that prospects for peace ``depend on full and honestSandinista compliance with their repeated pledges of democracy andfreedom.''   ``It's clear that close international scrutiny and sustainedpressure will be critical to induce Sandinista compliance,'' hesaid.   The package calls for non-lethal aid to the rebels until theNicaraguan elections scheduled for next February.   The money, administered through the State Department's Agencyfor International Development, also can be used to repatriate theContras.   The package also includes $4.2 million, to be administered bythe Roman Catholic Church in Nicaragua, in medical assistance forcivilian victims of the civil war.   The Contras, whose numbers are estimated at 11,000, are encampedalong the Honduran border.</TEXT></DOC>
