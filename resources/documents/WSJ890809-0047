The dollar's drive ran out of gas as the market turned to watch the results of a three-day U.S. Treasury quarterly refinancing that started yesterday. The U.S. producer price index and retail-sales data for July, both scheduled for release Friday, also have begun to draw attention.    The $10 billion in three-year notes auctioned by the Treasury got a lukewarm reception, but foreign-exchange dealers are more interested in today's sale of 10-year bonds and tomorrow's sale of 30-year bonds, both of which should better attract foreign investors.    Investors in the New York Federal Reserve District bought $9.51 billion of three-year notes.    Traders say the longer-term bond sales will win substantial participation from Japanese and other overseas investors, in turn supporting the dollar when they buy the currency to pay for bond purchases.    But dealers differed on how far bondmarket related buying can take the dollar. Some predicted the currency will linger near 1.90 marks; others called for a rise to as high as 1.9250 marks by tomorrow.    In late afternoon New York trading, the dollar was at 1.8925 marks, down from 1.9162 marks late Monday, and at 138.75 yen, below 140.05 yen. Sterling was trading at $1.6265, up from $1.5991 Monday.    In Tokyo Wednesday, the dollar opened for trading at 138.72 yen, down from Tuesday's Tokyo close of 139.25 yen.    The dollar slid slowly through Asian and European trading Tuesday, when participants decided to take profits on the U.S. currency's sharp gains Friday and Monday. Uncertainty surrounding the response to the Treasury financing helped trigger the drive to lock in profits.    The dollar remained depressed but above its lows through U.S. dealings in light activity.    Bond prices have fallen and yields have risen on the perception that a recent slide in interest rates, prompted by a series of Fed easings, has for the time being reached the end of its tether, traders said. As a result, foreign interest in the 10-year and 30-year bonds should be fairly active, many predicted.    Gillie Augeri, vice president and chief dealer at Connecticut National Bank, Hartford, Conn., said she expects healthy purchases of 10-year and 30-year bonds by Japanese investors and an accompanying climb in the dollar. About $19.5 billion of both bonds will be offered for sale.    However, participants are being kept on their toes by rumors that many Japanese investors have bought the dollars they need for U.S. government bond purchases and that the Bank of Japan will intervene to supply the market with dollars should the yen sink too far, some traders said.    If the response to today's bond auction is worse than expected, traders warned, participants who bought dollars during the past few days, anticipating elevated demand for the currency from abroad, may rush to dump their holdings.    A dollar move in either direction should be limited ahead of the July PPI and retail-sales figures, said Larry Weinman, a trader at the New York branch of Chicago's Harris Trust andamp; Savings Bank.    If the index shows a rebound in prices or if retail sales pick up more than expected, the market will expect the Fed to delay easing credit again until at least the end of this month, opening the door for new dollar gains. Lower interest rates generally reduce demand for the domestic currency by hurting returns on many interest-bearing investments.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $366.20 an ounce, up 30 cents. Estimated volume was a light 2.4 million ounces.    In early trading in Hong Kong Wednesday, gold was quoted at $366.35 an ounce. </TEXT></DOC>
