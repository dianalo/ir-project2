(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Levity has returned to the police barracksin this ailing steel mill town now that residents have raised$110,000 to enable nearly half the force to return to work followinga week's layoff.   ``It's the greatest feeling in the world,'' said Alfred Tedesco,one of 21 officers who returned to work Sunday following a week-longfurlough.   ``We're used to being on the other side of the fence. And to seesomething like this touches a part of your heart.''   The layoffs, ordered by Mayor Louis Washowich to save $90,000,were to last three months. But the fund-raising campaign led by thevoluntary ambulance crew in this town 15 miles south of Pittsburghnetted more than enough money to bring all the officers backimmediately.   ``As a police officer, you tend to become hardened to life. Youdeal with the criminal element for so long that you tend to believethere are only two types of people in this world, cops and badguys,'' said Inspector Daniel Kochman, who was laid off after morethan nine years on the force. ``To see something like this opensyour eyes again.''   The McKeesport Emergency Medical Services started the campaignwith a $15,000 donation from its own building fund.   Throughout last week, some of the 38,000 residents droppedthousands of dollars into cans at churches, clubs, restaurants andbusinesses, and people from as far away as Nevada sent checks andgood wishes.   By Friday, the campaign netted more than $54,000, whichPittsburgh-based Equibank promised to match.   ``I would have bet my whole year's pay that they wouldn't havemade it,'' said Judy McLaren, a clerk on the 50-member police force.   Others weren't so skeptical, though.   ``People here have seen hard times. They know what it's like tobe down,'' said Connie Derrick, who manages a discount store. ``Fora town that depressed to get that much money together says a lot.''   Donations have continued to pour in, said Betty Patterson,president of the ambulance service. Fund-raisers from disco dancesto polka parties are planned every weekend for the next month.   Any surplus money will be saved for next year, she said, so thepolice department can use it in case of a similar financial crunch.   Washowich ordered the layoffs after state arbitrators awarded thepolice 4 to 4{ percent wage hikes.   The mayor had asked all city employees to accept wage freezesafter the city found itself $1.3 million in debt at the end of lastyear, but the police refused and the issue went to arbitration.   New officers on the force make $14,000 to $14,500 a year, orabout $6.97 an hour.   Although heartened by the campaign, the mayor said the city stillmust deal with the $225,000 cost of the increase in police salariesin 1990.</TEXT></DOC>
