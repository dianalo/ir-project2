The bidding rights of another 325 contractors were temporarilysuspended because of wrongdoing.   The 307 debarments fell five short of the six-month record of 312established during the second half of fiscal 1988.   The figures were released Wednesday in the latest semi-annualreport to Congress by the Pentagon's inspector general. It coversOct. 1, 1988, to March 31.   Inspector General June Gibbs Brown said investigators ``conductedsignificant fraud investigations on matters like defective pricing,product substitution and false claims.''   ``Those efforts to curb defective and substandard products,conspiracy and labor cost mischaring resulted in monetary recoveriesof $258 million,'' she said in the report.   The inspector general maintains a staff of auditors andinvestigators who operate outside the control of top Pentagonexecutives. The office was created in 1983.   The report, dated May 30, discloses that auditors issued morethan 26,000 new contract audits involving $124 billion worth of workduring the six-month period. The auditors either disallowed or savedfor other uses more than $2.2 billion through the audits, the reportsaid.   U.S. Army Corps of Engineers auditors saved an estimated $6.7million by challenging questionable awards or future contractingplans, and Pentagon auditors saved another $484.3 million throughfollow-up audits aimed at completing cases that led to managementdisputes over the auditor's recommendations, the report said.   The Justice Department obtained 455 indictments on behalf of thePentagon during the period, in addition to 43 indictments at thelocal, state or foreign level and 258 recommendations forcourts-martial.   Among some of the more significant actions cited during theperiod was a settlement with the Sundstrand Corp. of a false claimsand illegal gratuities case that resulted in a $115 million fine and$62.3 million in administrative settlement payments.</TEXT></DOC>
