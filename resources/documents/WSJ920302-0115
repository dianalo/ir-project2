Bill Clinton says the samething. Mr. Tsongas says he knows why. So does Mr. Clinton.   The agreement stops there. Mr. Tsongas says the U.S.economy needs more, and cheaper, capital. Mr. Clinton says itneeds more, and better, education and training.</LP><TEXT>   More than their disagreement over cutting taxes for themiddle class -- Mr. Clinton wants to, Mr. Tsongas doesn't --this debate defines the differing economic views of the twoDemocratic front-runners. Mr. Tsongas supports bigger taxcuts for business and investors; Mr. Clinton supports ascheme for improving schools and forcing employers to do moretraining. The third leading candidate, Nebraska Sen. BobKerrey, mixes the two approaches, giving equal weight tocapital investment and education.   Mr. Clinton and his advisers are comfortable with thecontrast with Mr. Tsgonas. &quot;Franklin Roosevelt didn't get thecountry off its back by saying that the only thing we have tofear is a lack of venture capital,&quot; the Arkansas governorsaid last week as he went on the offensive against Mr.Tsongas. Attempting to highlight the contrast, Mr. Clinton isrunning ads and stating in Democratic debates, as he did inGeorgia and Maryland yesterday, that he would &quot;put peoplefirst.&quot;   Mr. Tsongas's camp is understandably uneasy about beingdescribed as the presidential candidate who values machinesover people. &quot;I'm for people, too, but we have to give themsomeplace to go to make a living,&quot; the former Massachusettssenator said over the weekend. In his economic manifesto, Mr.Tsongas argues that &quot;the health of our school systems is themajor . . . determinant of our long-term economic and socialviability.&quot; But styling himself as a &quot;pro-business Democrat,&quot;Mr. Tsongas also argues that nothing is more important than&quot;the original act -- the creation of national wealth.&quot;   &quot;The first thing to be said is that both of them areright,&quot; says Dale Jorgensen, a Harvard economist who is inneither candidate's camp. To assure that the U.S. economy ishealthy and competitive in the next century, it needs bothmore capital investment and better education, he says. ButMr. Tsongas's and Mr. Clinton's differing emphases lead themto signficantly different economic prescriptions.   Mr. Tsongas proposes an investment tax credit that hisstaff estimates might cost $5 billion a year, and a cut inthe capital-gains tax rate that would cost another $5 billiona year if not more. Both are aimed at reducing the cost ofcapital to businesses so they will invest more. He hasn'tspelled out any detailed scheme for improving education andsays little about apprenticeship or job training. Like Mr.Clinton, he would spend more on the Head Start preschoolprogram and provide more government loans for collegetuition.   Mr. Clinton, in contrast, backs a much narrower investmenttax credit and capital-gains tax cut. (The two combined wouldcost less than $1 billion a year.) Drawing from his highlypublicized campaign to improve Arkansas' schools, Mr. Clintonwould establish national exams for all elementary andsecondary school students, fund a national apprenticeshipprogram for non-college-bound high school students and usethe tax code to force employers to provide training to alltheir workers.   Straddling these two camps, Mr. Kerrey backs both aninvestment tax credit and a cut in the capital-gains tax sothat only profits in excess of inflation are taxed. He wouldoffer &quot;partial government backing&quot; for loans to small-sizedand medium-sized businesses. And he would create a $1 billionfund to make grants to local school systems with innovativeideas.   The contrast between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Tsongas reflectsthe men to whom they turn for economic advice. Mr. Clinton isclearly influenced by Robert Reich, a political economist atHarvard University's Kennedy School whom he met when bothwere Rhodes Scholars at Oxford University.   &quot;The only unique resource within a nation is its people,their skills and education,&quot; Mr. Reich argues. Using theeconomists' jargon for education, he adds: &quot;Clinton hasfocused his career on human capital; that's the centerpieceof his philosophy. The Republicans and, judging from hisspeeches and writings, Paul Tsongas focus on financialcapital.&quot;   Mr. Tsongas has listened for years to George Hatsopolous,a Massachusetts entrepreneur who is something of anevangelist on the subject of using tax policy to reduce theU.S. cost of capital. &quot;We are not investing enough. We areunderinvesting in every conceivable area,&quot; says Mr.Hatsopolous, chairman of Thermo Electron Corp. of Waltham,Mass. &quot;There is really nothing else wrong with this country.&quot;   The debate between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Tsongas mirrors adebate among economists over the relative importance of thecost of capital and the quality of education -- and over thedegree to which government can influence either.   One school, which includes many advisers to Republicans,stresses the need to reduce the U.S. cost of capital. Itnotes that the cost of capital in Japan is lower than in theU.S., and says tax and other government policies are partlyto blame. Even within this school, there are differencesabout the wisdom of capital-gains tax cuts as the way toreduce the cost of capital.   Another school, populated by liberals, reads the economichistory of the 1980s as proof that lowering the cost ofcapital doesn't accomplish much. &quot;The cost of capital hasbeen falling for four years,&quot; says Jeff Faux of the EconomicPolicy Institute, a liberal think-tank. &quot;We ain't seen noinvestment boom yet.&quot;   Despite the fixation of voters and the press on thecurrent sluggish state of the U.S. economy, neither reducingthe cost of capital nor beefing up education is likely tobring quick results. Both are fundamentally long-termstrategies -- though Robert Solow, a Massachusetts Instituteof Technology economist who won a Nobel Prize for his workexplaining how economies grow, says that the lead time forimproving the educational system is even longer than that forreducing the cost of capital, &quot;if you can get it down.&quot;   Given the opportunity, Mr. Solow would choose a littlefrom Mr. Tsongas's menu and a little from Mr. Clinton's. Heis a big fan of the broad kind of investment tax credit Mr.Tsongas proposes, but opposes a cut in the capital-gains taxand, like Mr. Clinton, he also endorses proposals thatrequire employers to train their workers or contribute to agovernment training fund. &quot;I know it (mandated training) isvulnerable to being Mickey Mouse,&quot; he says. &quot;But in the greatAmerican society, everything is vulnerable to Mickey Mouse.&quot;   ---   Education and Investment                                                                                                          Democratic candidates Bill Clinton and Paul Tsongas takediffering approaches to the long-term issue of how to makethe U.S. economy more competitive.
