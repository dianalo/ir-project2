Nicholas Jr. says.   The Time Warner executive, who has been designated to eventuallybecome the lone chief executive of the media and entertainmentcompany, also said Thursday he expects there will be an unspecifiedamount of sales of non-core assets over the next few years.   Nicholas made the comments in an appearance Thursday eveningbefore about 100 people at the Columbia University Graduate Schoolof Journalism, where he had been invited to discuss Time Inc.'s $14billion takeover of Warner Communications Inc.   Earlier this summer, Time purchased a controlling interest inWarner for $70 a share and changed its name to Time Warner. Itplans to acquire the rest of Warner's stock in exchange forpreferred stock and Warner's stake in a television companycontrolled by Chris Craft Industries Inc.   Also on Thursday, Time Warner said 38 commercial banks haveagreed to lend it $11 billion for the acquisition of Warner. Thepermanent bank financing, replacing temporary ``bridge'' financing,will go into place when the deal is closed, which is expected bythe end of the year.   In reponse to questions from an audience of about 100 people atColumbia, Nicholas cited his company's plans to launchEntertainment Weekly as an example of the broad financialcapability and global reach that media companies will need in the1990s and beyond.   He said it costs $100 million to $150 million to introduce a newmass-market magazine such as Entertainment Weekly in the UnitedStates.   Nicholas added that if the U.S. version of the magazine provessuccessful, versions could be adapted for publication in othercountries.   Time announced in July plan to start the new magazine, its firstmajor mass-market magazine launch since it stopped publication ofTV-Cable Week in 1983 after losing $47 million.   Entertainment Weekly will contain reviews and reporting ontelevision, movies, video, music and books.   Nicholas also said the company was interested in pursuingpossible joint ventures and partnerships of unspecified types inEurope.   Asked whether Time Warner planned to sell assets, he replied,``I expect there will be some trimming over the next couple ofyears.'' But he said assets that may be sold would not come fromthe company's core businesses of magazine, music, filmedentertainment, cable television and pay television.   He declined to identify any speific assets that might be sold.   In the announcement on the $11 billion in bank lending, thecompany said managing agents are Bankers Trust Co. andManufacturers Hanover Trust Co.
