The stockrecovered most of the decline, closing at $26.75, down $1.13 for the day.;   The FDA advisory panel recommended approval of Xoma's treatment for graft vs.host disease, a potentially fatal complication from bone marrow transplants.The complication occurs when the transplanted marrow's disease-fighting&quot;T-cells&quot; attack the recipient, destroying the liver, skin andgastrointestinal tract.;    The treatment must still be approved by the FDAitself, but the regulatory agency usually follows the recommendation of itsadvisory panels.;    Graft vs. host disease affects about half of the 4,000bone marrow transplant patients in the United States each year, and half ofthose who develop the disease die from it. Moreover, many more transplantswould be attempted if such complications could be overcome, doctors say.;   The treatment is the first &quot;magic bullet&quot; to receive regulatory approval.Discovered in the 1970s, magic bullets, known in medicine as immunotoxins,have long been heralded as a promising weapon against cancer and otherdisorders. Immunotoxins are molecules that combine the ability of an antibodyto home in on a disease-causing agent with the deadliness of a toxin.;    Inthe case of Xoma's treatment, called CD5, the antibody part of the moleculezeroes in on the offending T-cells from the transplanted bone marrow, whilethe toxin, an enzyme called the ricin A chain, neutralizes its target. CD5 wasdeveloped in collaboration with the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center inNew York.;    Xoma tested CD5 in the most severe cases of graft vs. hostdisease, which didn't respond to standard steroid therapy. A majority of thepatients responded favorably, with some patients ridding themselves of thedisease. The tests also showed a reduction in the T-cells that caused thedisease.;    The company called the approval an important milestone. &quot;Today'sdecision is a major step toward validation of the concept of (immunotoxin)therapy in immune system disorders,&quot; Dr. Patrick J. Scannon, Xoma's founderand president, said in a statement Monday. &quot;We are very pleased by thecommittee's positive findings.&quot;;    Xoma is also testing CD5 as a treatmentfor other so-called auto-immune diseases, in which the body attacks its owntissues, including arthritis, diabetes and organ transplant rejection.;    CD5is also the first drug of the decade-old Xoma to be approved. Its second drug,which is aimed at a vastly larger market, is a treatment for septic shock, apotentially fatal condition that is caused by a bacterial infection oftenacquired in hospitals. Septic shock kills 10,000 people in the United Stateseach year.;    The challenge to Xoma's data stemmed in part from its strategyof developing drugs for only the most deadly diseases, on the theory that theywould provide the easiest proof of whether the drug is effective.;    In partbecause the trial involved patients on the verge of death, Xoma didn't conductits study of CD5 as a standard &quot;double-blind&quot; trial, in which one group getsthe drug and another gets a placebo. Instead, Xoma gave the drug to a group ofpatients and then compared the results to historical data.;    At the meetingMonday, an FDA official raised questions about the lack of a double-blindtrial. He said the historical data was not as bad as Xoma had claimed in itsanalysis and that by comparison, Xoma's treatment was less effective, sourcessaid.;    The FDA's questioning prompted Jeffrey Casdin, an analyst atOppenheimer andamp; Co., to call the Wall Street firm's sales force and tell them toadvise their clients to hold or sell their shares in the company. As a resultof the premature prognosis, the stock tumbled $5.38, or more than 19 percent,to $22.50 in morning trading.;    But Xoma officials responded effectively tothe questions, analysts said. What saved the day was an unusual show ofsupport by several of the clinicians who had conducted the trials. They saidthey would want the drug available to them if they were in need of such atreatment.;    At such meetings, the doctors who conducted the test rarelyvoice their opinions about the effectiveness or the safety of the drug.;   Analysts said the panel's decision was a validation of Xoma's strategy andreflected well on the company's efforts.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  ALEX BARNUM, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Street  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910611  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  June  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  844  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday June 11, 199100163042,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
