The actions rekindled fears of a global interest-rate spiral andunnerved financial markets. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones averageof 30 industrial stocks, up 37.34 points on Wednesday, dropped15.82 to 2,010.85.   The European interest-rate hikes also had the intended effect ofknocking the dollar lower, especially against the West German mark.The U.S. currency was quoted at around 1.8645 marks in lateafternoon trading in New York, down sharply from 1.8820 marks lateWednesday.   Some analysts believe the rate hikes by West Germany'sBundesbank, the Bank of England and other European central bankscould prompt another sharp tightening of credit in the UnitedStates _ where the Federal Reserve pushed rates higher only a fewweeks ago.   ``There's some danger that we could get'' an increase in theFed's discount rate, said Robert Brusca, chief economist forinvestment firm Nikko Securities Co. International Inc. ``Thedollar is really looking like it's made a turn for the worse.''   Other experts, however, deem it unlikely that the Fed would takesuch dramatic action again to raise rates so close to thepresidential election in November. Instead, they expect the centralbank to nudge rates gently higher by using its routine operationsin the money markets _ even if inflationary pressures heat up andthe dollar slumps.   ``The farther we get along on this process of leapfrogging(interest rates), the more reluctance starts to grow,'' said HughJohnson, a senior vice president of First Albany Corp. ``In someways, it's like a poker game and everyone starts raising the ante _and some people start dropping out.''   In a surprise move Aug. 9, the U.S. central bank announced ahalf-percentage point increase in its discount rate to combatinflation. That put the fee the Fed charges member banks forshort-term loans at 6.5 percent, its highest level in more than twoyears.   It was the first rise in the key rate since September 1987 _ themonth preceding the stock market crash _ and sparked a half-pointincrease in the U.S. prime lending rate to 10 percent.   After the Fed increase, many market watchers believed it wasonly a matter of time before the United States' major tradingpartners responded in kind.   ``We had been more or less anticipating'' a European rate rise,said David Redding, an international economist for Bankers TrustCo. ``It's more of a catch-up on the part of the foreigners.''   The Bank of England signaled a full percentage point increase inthe British commercial banks' base lending rate to 12 percent,following a government report on the country's trade deficit inJuly.   The report showed Britain's July trade gap soared 72 percent toa record 2.65 billion pounds, or about $4.5 billion. BritishChancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said the rate was boostedto keep inflation under control.   The Bundesbank raised its discount rate to 3.5 percent from 3percent, citing the dollar's recent strength against the mark. Thecentral banks of France, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Austriaquickly followed suit with rate hikes.   In Tokyo, however, a senior Bank of Japan official said there is``absolutely no need to consider an adjustment in Japan's monetarypolicy just because the Bundesbank and the Bank of England raisedtheir base rates.''   While the increases may have been foreseen, experts did findsurprising the ferocity of the West Germans' verbal attack on thedollar.   Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said the bank will``continue to do everything to stem the decline of the mark againstthe dollar.''   Poehl's strident remarks seemed to overreach the February 1987``Louvre'' agreement on the value of the dollar informally adoptedby the major industrial countries, Redding suggested.   ``It makes you wonder about the coordination,'' he said.
