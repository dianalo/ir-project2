Tests of tissues from lung cancer patients indicated thata particular gene had been &quot;turned on&quot; in the patients andwas producing a protein that turned chemicals in cigarettesmoke or other inhaled chemicals into powerful cancer-causingsubstances.</LP><TEXT>   If true, this would explain one of the major mysteries ofsmoking-related lung cancer. This is the fact that despitedecades of analysis, the known cancer-causing chemicals incigarette smoke don't account for its apparent ability tocause lung cancer in humans.   The discovery of the gene also suggested why only 5% to 7%of long-term cigarette smokers develop lung cancer. Thescientists speculated the suspect gene is turned on moreeasily in some people than in others, rendering them mostlikely to get lung cancer if they smoke. Some people may beborn with a high likelihood that the gene will be turned onand they are in danger of developing lung cancer even if theydon't smoke, speculated Theodore L. McLemore, a pulmonarydisease specialist who headed the research team.   If the theory proposed in the new report is correct, itmay be possible to screen cigarette smokers and pinpointthose at highest risk of developing lung cancer, Dr. McLemoresaid in a telephone interview. It also should be possible toscreen families of lung cancer victims to see which relativesmight have inherited a predisposition to the deadly diseases.   The new report, published in the current issue of theJournal of the National Cancer Institute, comes but two weeksafter two other reports suggesting that a geneticpredisposition to lung cancer makes it extremely dangerousfor those born with the predisposition to smoke cigarettes.One of these reports showed that smoking-related lung cancertended to run in families. The other showed that thegenetically-controlled manner in which the body processed aparticular drug seemed linked to a susceptibility to lungcancer.   The report pinpoints a specific gene that is closelylinked to, if not the cause of, the cancer-producing process.The gene is known as the CYP1A1 gene, according to the reportby Dr. McLemore and his colleagues at the National CancerInstitute in Bethesda, Md., and the Johns Hopkins Universitymedical school in Baltimore.   Dr. McLemore left the cancer institute at the end of Julyto go into private practice in Paris, Texas, where, he says,he plans to continue his research on the lung-cancer gene.   In their report, the researchers said they had examinedthe activity of the CYP1A1 gene in lung tissues taken from 56men and women who had been operated on for lung cancer atJohns Hopkins.   The researchers tested the normal, or noncancerous,portions of lung tissues from the patients for signs ofwhether the gene was active or not. The tests indicated thatthe gene was active, or &quot;turned on,&quot; in 17 of 19 smokers butwas inactive in all five of the patients who had neversmoked. Examination of the normal lung tissues from otherpatients who had quit smoking indicated that the gene wasturned off in those who hadn't smoked for three months orlonger.   They also found that in the cancerous tissues the gene wasmore likely to be turned on in smokers than in nonsmokers.   The findings &quot;further support the theoretical role of theCYP1A1 gene&quot; in causing lung cancer by showing that is activein smokers who develop lung cancer, the researchers said.&quot;However, it is not possible to conclude a definite cause andeffect relationship from these studies,&quot; they cautioned.   Nevertheless, the scientists pointed to a plethora ofanimal experiments which hinted that the protein produced bythe gene may well lead to cancer. It's known that productionof the protein, aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase, can be inducedby cigarette smoke, they noted. The protein, they said,belongs to a &quot;superfamily&quot; of proteins, many of which arecapable of activating cancer-causing chemicals found incigarette smoke.</TEXT></DOC>
