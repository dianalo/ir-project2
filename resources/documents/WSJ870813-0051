The banking bill President Reagan signed into law Monday directed the FDIC to pay 9% interest on the certificates issued by Golden Pacific National Bank. The interest covers the period between June 21, 1985, when the bank closed, and Sept. 11, 1986, the day a federal judge ruled that 290 of the 363 holders of the certificates were entitled to federal deposit insurance.    When the institution was closed, bank officers said they had treated millions of dollars in customers' funds as uninsured investments rather than as deposits. The FDIC elected to ask the court to decide whether the funds were insured.    Last year, the FDIC sold Golden Pacific to Hongkong andamp; Shanghai Banking Corp.    Normally, the FDIC guarantees that depositors at failed banks will be paid the interest earned up to the day the bank closes. But because of the long period of uncertainty over whether Golden Pacific customers would get any of their money, Congress directed the FDIC to make additional interest payments.    The principal, about $14 million, has already been repaid by the FDIC. The interest payments began yesterday, when about 50 certificate holders were paid at the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association in New York; they will run through tomorrow. </TEXT></DOC>
