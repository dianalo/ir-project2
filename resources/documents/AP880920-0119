(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Firefighters working double shiftstoday battled a wind-fanned arson blaze to the edge of this city asflames destroyed seven homes, scorched more than 18,000 acres andforced 500 people to flee.   But in Montana and Wyoming, firefighters were sent home as cool,moist fall weather helped them get a handle on the blazes that haveblackened hundreds of thousands of acres.   Fifteen fires burning Monday had charred 1.39 million acres inWyoming, Montana, Washington, Oregon, Idaho and California, saidArnold Hartigan of the Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho,where the firefighting is coordinated. In all this season, 69,099fires have blackened 4,140,000 acres, including about 2 millionacres in Alaska, he said.   In Northern California, gusty wind combined with highertemperatures to stir up two major blazes. The arson fire grew to18,000 acres and jumped a containment line late Monday outsideVacaville, about 55 miles northeast of San Francisco. It reachedwithin a third of a mile of town, said fire captain Ken Thomas.   Authorities established a new line today along a 10-mile stretchof road, along which the 500 residents were ordered to evacuate,said fire captain John Ferreira.   ``We're leaving,'' said David Foster, 33, one of Vacaville's61,000 residents. ``Staying around would be stupid.''   Ferreira said firefighters were optimistic about holding theblaze.   ``If today goes well for us, we should have 100 percentcontainment Thursday,'' he said. Officials predicted that afternoonwind could push the blaze toward scattered homes to the west of thefire line at the western edge of town.   Along Interstate 80, the glow from the fire could be seen 13miles away, from Cordelia. Thick smoke drifted through downtownVacaville.   The fire started Saturday north of Vacaville is one of two majorCalifornia blazes that have destroyed 15 homes as they roaredacross 26,000 acres of wildland, brush and timber.   At the 8,000-acre fire near Redding in Shasta County, two menclearing burned timber suffered head and back injuries Monday whena tree fell on them, officials said. Both were hospitalized incritical condition, officials said.   Officials said that fire was caused when someone apparentlytarget shooting shot out an insulator from a powerline about 20miles east of Redding, 220 miles northeast of San Francisco, andthe sparks ignited the drought-dry brush.   Eighty firefighters were left today to mop up at Montana's onlyremaining major forest fire, a 34,500-acre blaze in GlacierNational Park. ``I think fire season is just about over here,''said spokeswoman Madelyn Kempf said, adding it had rained throughmost of the night.   In Wyoming, Yellowstone National Park officials released 1,000soldiers who were in the park for more than 30 days battling theflames that involved half the 2.2 million-acre park.   Officials also started to release employees of the National ParkService, U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management.   Cooler conditions, shorter days and higher humidities helpedlimit fire activity.   The Vacaville fire destroyed seven homes, 10 outbuildings and $7million worth of telecommunications equipment, officials said.   Although no incendiary device was recovered in Miller Canyon,where most of the destroyed homes were located, arson wassuspected, said Ferreira.   Three other blazes began in the area since Saturday but theyhave been contained, officials said.   Crews fighting the Redding fire reported progress with 60percent of the blaze contained. Crews were expected to encircle theblaze tonight and bring it under control by Wednesday evening,forestry officials say.   Six homes and six other structures were burned on Sunday andabout 300 people were evacuated, but authorities said they wereallowed to return to home Monday.   Lower temperatures in the 60s and 70s, 30 percent to 35 percenthumidity and 5 mph winds helped the 920 firefighters working tobuild 5.5 miles of line around the fire, authorities said.   Firefighters also used 85 engines, seven helicopters, eightairtankers, and 31 water tankers in their effort, estimating firesuppression costs at $400,000.</TEXT></DOC>
