Ariane-4 blasted off without a hitch from the European SpaceAgency space center on the north coast of South America at 7:19a.m. EDT. Sixty-six seconds later the first-stage boosters firedaccording to plan, with the final, third-stage rockets firing at 5minutes 49 seconds after takeoff.   The space shot was designed by Arianespace, the agency'scommercial arm, to demonstrate the space readiness of the Ariane-4,Europe's biggest and most versatile rocket ever.   Twelve minutes and 46 seconds after takeoff, the rocket reachedorbit with its international payload, the European Meteosat-Ps andAMSAT-3C and the American PAS-1.   Ariane-4 is capable of hauling up to 4.6 tons into orbit.Ariane-3, the previous generation, had a maximum capacity of 2.8tons.   In addition to its increased power, the rocket design allowsengineers to strap on different configurations of solid and liquidboosters, tailoring the vehicle to a client's specific budget andneeds, the agency said.   Ariane-4 will be Europe's ``workhorse on the world launchservices market until the end of this century,'' according toArianespace officials.   Developed over the past six years at a cost of $575 million,Ariane-4 will be competing in the coming decade with the UnitedStates, the Soviet Union, China and Japan.   Arianespace already hauls half the world's commercial payloadsand currently holds 67 launch contracts worth $3.4 billion.   For the inaugural launch, Ariane-4 put into geostationary orbitMeteostat-P2 which will furnish weather data to 16 Europeancountries.   The 1,559-pound satellite will monitor weather over most ofEurope, Africa, the Middle East and the eastern half of SouthAmerica.   It replaces the Meteostat-F2, launched in 1981, which untilrecently sent back pictures every half hour.   The 330 pound Amsat-3C, known by the knickname Oscar-13, willserve the needs of amateur radio operators around the world.   Meteosat and Oscar reached orbit about 20 minutes after blastoff.   About three minutes later, the American satellite PAS-1 reachedorbit. The satellite owned by the American telecommunicationscompany Pan American Satellite will further telecommuncationsservice at moderate cost between Latin America, the United Statesand Europe.   Officials at the space center called the inaugural launch acomplete success.</TEXT></DOC>
