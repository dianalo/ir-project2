Thermotolerance could be inducedby 30 min at 43{sup 0}C 4h before final treatment. Thermotolerance couldbe observed also in cells which did not receive a pretreatment when thetemperature of the final treatment was below 42-43{sup 0}C. Arrheniusanalysis of heat survival curves of non tolerant cells in CM showed abreak in the curve at 43.2{sup 0}C (pH 7.3) or at 42.8{sup 0}C (pH 6.6).Above this break the activation energy was 510 kJ/mole (pH 7.3) or 630kJ/mole (pH 6.6) and below this break 3050 kJ/mole (pH 7.3) or 2760 kJ/mole(pH 6.6). Tolerant cells in CM showed no break in the Arrhenius curveneither at pH 7.3 nor at pH 6.6. The TTR at pH 7.3, 43{sup 0}C was 28.The activation energy in the range 42-46{sup 0}C proved to be 875 kJ/mole.The TTR observed with cells heated in HHS is much lower. Arrhenius analysisof both tolerant and non tolerant cells heated in HHS, in the range 43{sup0}-46{sup 0}C showed an activation energy of 440 kJ/mole irrespectiveof the pH (6.6 vs 7.5). Apparently the activation energy of cells, ina particular temperature region is strongly dependent on the externalconditions.</TEXT></DOC>
