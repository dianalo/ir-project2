<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-23-0229 </DOCNO><TEXT>The general theory of n-particle quantum-correlation function(n=1,2,3....)is presented in a unified way for both boson and fermion systems withboth nonzero intrinsic and isotopic spins at both pure and mixed stateson the basis of quantum-field theoretical approach. The quantum-mechanicalrequirement of symmetrization(boson) and antisymmetrization(fermion)is throughly implemented. The mutual conversion between the diverselyexisting definitions of the same quantum-correlation function is shownto be freely done. The general properties of the function are exploidedto maximum extent. In conclusion, it is mentioned that this theory shouldbe the fundamental knowledge to be studied before one begins to studythe particular quantum-correlation funtion for a given problem.</TEXT></DOC>
