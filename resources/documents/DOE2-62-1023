<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-62-1023 </DOCNO><TEXT>A set of method for evaluating the performance of applications on supercomputershas not yet been rigorously defined. This volume is a compilation ofresearch approaches and techniques that are a promising means to thatend. The contributions are grouped into three sections. Contributorsto Performance looks at applications, algorithms, compilers, operatingsystems, and memory issues. Measurements and Metrics addresses some ofthe current techniques and methods of performance evaluation. Among thetopics are: the performance monitoring capabilities of the CEDAR system,the methodology behind the Livermore loops, the empirical analysis ofsystem performance, and a software simulator developed in connectionwith the RP3 project. Methods, Models, and Directions looks ways of establishinga general and theoretical framework for supercomputer performance evaluation.</TEXT></DOC>
