The 18-year-old woman, meanwhile, refused to discuss the matter.   ``She would just like to disappear,'' said Samuel E. BeecherJr., attorney for the unmarried Terre Haute woman identified incourt documents only as V.J.H. ``She's a very private person. Shenever imagined that she would have had this publicity.''   The woman's attorneys announced Wednesday that she had undergonean abortion despite a Vigo Circuit Court order prohibiting her fromterminating her pregnancy. The order was issued Monday at therequest of a 24-year-old Terre Haute truck driver who claimed to bethe father.   After the court order was issued, attorneys for both sides hadasked for an expedited appeal to the state Supreme Court. OnThursday, the justices rejected that request.   ``You have to have two things _ a question of great publicimportance and an emergency situation,'' said court administratorKarl Mulvaney. ``The court's feeling is that clearly there is noemergency any more.''   The case will be heard first by a three-judge panel of the stateCourt of Appeals. The case has not been assigned yet, Mulvaney said.   Because the case involves a paternity action, the names of theman and the woman are not revealed in court documents. The woman'sattorneys dispute the man's claim to be the father.   Richard A. Waples, legal director of the Indiana Civil LibertiesUnion, argued that previous U.S. Supreme Court decisions give themother sole authority to terminate a pregnancy during the firstthree months.   But Waples said he wanted the injunction issued by Vigo CircuitJudge Robert H. Brown overturned because ``if this order is allowedto go uncorrected, other judges might be tempted to do the same.''   James Bopp Jr., attorney for the national Right to Lifeorganization and for the Terre Haute man, said he wants a highercourt ruling on whether a father's rights should be weighed againstthe mother's in such cases.   Bobb said in court papers that his client was upset about theabortion and thought the mother terminated the pregnancy forfrivolous reasons.   Waples said that he has found at least three cases where themother's right to go ahead and have an abortion despite a courtorder was ultimately upheld.   Bopp said he isn't interested in punishing the woman, andBeecher said Brown has indicated he wouldn't seek a contemptcitation, which could carry penalties of a $500 fine and 90 days injail.</TEXT></DOC>
