The board that runs the Queen City Metro transit system alsoapproved the tentative agreement and hoped to restore bus serviceby Sunday morning.   ``Strikes are tough. ... I hope we can mend those fences,'' saidRobert Baker, president of the striking Local 627 of theAmalgamated Transit Union.   Negotiators concluded an all-night bargaining session Fridaymorning by announcing they had reached a compromise agreement. Thethree-year proposal gives the union greater job security and wageincreases of about 5 percent the first year and 4 percent each ofthe two final years, Baker said.   Baker said union leadership urged passage of the settlement,which was approved at a union meeting by a 465-40 margin.   The strike against the Queen City Metro transit agency beganFeb. 2 over wages and the company's proposal to use part-timeemployees to supplement regular workers during peak transit hours.The union, which represents about 750 bus drivers, mechanics andclerks, strongly objected to part-time employees in the belief theypose a threat to the jobs of full-time employees.   A top-scale bus driver made $12.17 an hour, under the oldcontract. Queen City Metro says drivers were making about $30,000 ayear when routine overtime was figured in.</TEXT></DOC>
