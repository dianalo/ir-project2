Toshiba Machine Co. already has been found to have exported sophisticated milling tools to the Soviets between 1982 and 1984. The machines are believed to have helped the Soviets design quieter submarines.    The MITI spokesman said the latest investigation focuses on the possibility that exports of similar machine tools were made by the Toshiba unit to the Soviet Union before 1982. However, he said, the investigation so far hasn't found any new, illegal exports.    Toshiba Machine officials conceded that the company sold two units of milling tools to the Soviets in 1974. But they said that machinery didn't violate restrictions imposed by the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls, the multinational Paris-based organization set up to control the flow of sophisticated technology to Communist-bloc countries.    The U.S. Congress is moving toward sanctions against Toshiba in response to the exports that already have been revealed. The Commerce Department, meanwhile, is temporarily denying Toshiba blanket rights to import sensitive products from the U.S., and the Pentagon has decided it won't give the company any new contracts until officials have more information on the technology diversion and how Japan will prevent another such incident. </TEXT></DOC>
