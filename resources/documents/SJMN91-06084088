Henderson, one of theworld's leading specialists on vaccination programs and a professor of publichealth at Johns Hopkins University.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  LOW VACCINATION RATE FOR KIDS PUTS U.S. ATRISK, EXPERT SAYS  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     Henderson, who led the successful World Health Organization campaign toeradicate smallpox and who has been nominated to be associate director of theWhite House Office of Science and Technology, said the U.S. record invaccinating children age 2 and younger is probably worse than that of anyother countries in the Western Hemisphere except Bolivia and Haiti.;    Hesaid the reappearance of measles, especially in inner cities, as well asrubella and whooping cough is a warning that preventable infections, includingpolio, also may make a comeback.;    Experts agree that these diseases, oncenearly eradicated in the United States, are on the rise chiefly because of afailure to immunize preschool-age children. Last year, 47 percent of themeasles cases occurred in children under age 5.;    State laws passed in the1970s require that children be immunized before they enter elementary school,and immunization rates are more than 99 percent in that age group, accordingto John Mullen, an epidemiologist in the immunization division of the federalCenters for Disease Control.;    But most routine immunizations, including acombination vaccine against measles, mumps and rubella, are administeredduring the first two years of a child's life.;    And, although immunizationsare required for nursery schools and licensed day-care centers, there are nolaws covering other preschool children. Figures from the Centers for DiseaseControl show that most of the measles outbreaks are striking poor, inner-citychildren.;    Henderson said his comparison of the United States to the restof the hemisphere was based on several estimates.;    One source was hisassessment of 1990 immunization figures reported by most countries in thehemisphere to the Pan American Health Organization. Exact U.S. immunizationfigures are unavailable, however, because the Reagan administration abolishedthe monitoring of immunization rates of preschool children. As a result, thegovernment has collected no national figures since 1985. Data collection willresume this year.;    Henderson said that, based on CDC studies, only abouthalf of 2-year-olds in U.S. inner cities are immunized. Nationally, heestimated the rate at about 70 percent.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Washington Post  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910324  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  2A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  441  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday March 24, 199100084088,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
