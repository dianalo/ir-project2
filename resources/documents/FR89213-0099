Section 181 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 (TheAct), as amended, requires the Department to preserve HUD-held and HUD-ownedmultifamily housing projects so that they are available to and affordableby low- and moderate-income persons. The Act provides that the Departmentmust determine how many units are occupied by low- and moderate-incomepersons on the date the mortgage is assigned to HUD and again on the dateit is foreclosed. The Department has a commitment under the Act to preservethe greater number of units determined on these two dates. In additionto the Department's commitment to provide for low- and moderate-incomepersons, the Act specifically requires the Department to provide assistanceunder the Section 8 program for those units that are occupied by lowerincome families eligible for Section 8 assistance. The Department has responsibility under the Section 8 program (Section8 of the Housing Act of 1937) to maximize the use of subsidy funds. Italso has responsibility under the act to manage and preserve housing forlow- and moderate-income persons. The subject data collection effort isnecessary to help the Department achieve these goals. Specifically, the Department must determine the number of units occupiedby lower income persons with incomes between 0 and 80 percent of medianincome. This will give the Department the number of units for which theDepartment must provide Section 8 assistance under the Act. In addition,the Department must also determine the number of units occupied by moderateincome persons with incomes between 81 and 120 percent of median income.This will help the Department to determine the need by moderate incomepersons for housing in these projects. In projects with mortgage interest subsidy and projects with rental subsidyfor 100 percent of the units, the Department assumes that all units areoccupied by low and moderate income tenants. The Department has adequateinformation available on these projects to determine the number of Section8 units to allocate. Therefore, no additional data collection is necessary.In projects that have a rental subsidy contract tied to only some of theunits, the Department assumes that the units covered by the subsidy contractare occupied by low and moderate income tenants. However, neither the Departmentnor owners have any way of knowing the incomes of tenant in units thatare not covered by a subsidy contract. Because of the unavailability ofinformation on units not covered by a subsidy contract and because theAct specifically refers to the actual number of units occupied by low incomepersons, we have determined that this information can only be acquiredthrough a survey of tenants by owners. 2. The Department will use this information to determine how many unitsto make available for low- and moderate-income persons while a mortgageis HUD-held and then after it is foreclosed. The Department is asking ownersto report tenant incomes as the following percentages of median income:0-50; 51-80; 81-95; 96-120; above 120. This breakdown of tenant incomemix will assist the Department in committing the necessary budget authorityto provide assistance for the units occupied by Section 8 eligible tenantsand will provide the Department with the necessary information so thatit can develop and apply different strategies to assure that units continueto be made available and affordable to low and moderate income persons.Failure to collect this data would result in noncompliance with the Actand would prevent the Department from fulfilling its responsibility ofeffectively managing its programs. 3. We have not given consideration to the use of improved information technologyto reduce the reporting burden on owners. There are no automated systemscurrently in use that could assist with the owners' effort. Since incomedata is not collected on tenants paying market rent, none of the Department'sautomated systems contain the required data. Further, the Act requiresus to survey every tenant not known to be low or moderate income. It doesnot permit us to estimate the number of units to be assisted based on asample of current tenants. 4. We are not requiring owners of subsidized properties to survey tenants,since all of the units are considered to be for low and moderate incomepersons. Owners of partially subsidized properties must survey only thosetenants who are not receiving any assistance (tenants for whom the ownerdoes not have a current HUD 50059 on file). Owners of unsubsidized propertiesmust survey all tenants. With this approach we assure that owners surveyonly those tenants who are not known already to be low- or moderate-income.5. Unless a tenant is receiving some type of subsidy, owners do not collectinformation on tenant incomes, except for purposes of initial screeningfor ability to pay the rent. The data required by the Act is not alreadyavailable. 6. Not applicable. 7. Not applicable. 8. There are no special circumstances requiring collection of informationthat is inconsistent with the guidelines in 5 CFR 1320.6. 9. In addition to discussions with the National Association of HUD ManagementAgents, The National Corporation of Housing Partnerships and The NationalHousing Partnership, we have had ongoing discussions with the followingindividuals on this data collection effort:<ITAG tagnum="25">Dan Grady, Monfric, Inc., 1915 Morena Blvd., San Diego, CA 92110,(619) 276-6271. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Barron Rush, CPM, Barron Builders andamp; Management Company, 18333Egret Bay Blvd., Suite 680, Houston, TX 77058, (713) 333-5211 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Charles A.

The form letter to tenants requesting data on incomes states that theinformation provided by tenants is subject to the Privacy Act and may bemade available only to appropriate Federal, State and local agencies. Noassurances of confidentiality are provided to owners. 11. This data collection effort on tenant incomes is not discretionary.It is mandated by the 1987 Housing and Community Development Act. The sampleletter from the owner to tenants states that they are required to collectthis information by law. It states that the owner will send an overallsummary of the income levels of the people living in the project to theDepartment. It further states that the owner will not be sending the Departmentinformation about individual tenants requested to do so by the Department.12/13. It is estimated that it will cost the Federal Government and therespondents approximately $15.00 per hour including overhead, printing,equipment, supplies and support staff.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,tp0,i1,s25,6,6,6</C> <H1>Total annual response \1\</H1><H1>Hours/response </H1><H1>Cost/hour</H1><H1>Annual cost</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Respondents 85 \2\<D>5.75 </D><D>$15.00 </D><D>$7,332</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Government 85 \2\ <D>.25 </D><D>15.00 </D><D>319</D><F>\1\ There is a one-time response in 1989 for the 724 projects in theHUD-held inventory, costing $62,445 for respondents (724 x 5.75 andmultiply;15) and $2,715 for government (724 x .25 x 15).</F><F>\2\ This number is based on the assumption that there will be 75 assignmentsand 10 foreclosures per year.</F></ITAG></ITAG> We based our estimates on the actual number of projects currently in ourHUD inventory and on the number of mortgages actually foreclosed and assignedover the last 5 years. We estimated the size of each project to be 150units. Based on actual data, we estimated that 75% of HUD-held and foreclosedmortgages would be insured under the 221(d)(3) and 221(d)(4) programs,with 30% of those projects receiving Section 8 assistance. (This reducedthe estimated number of tenants in (d)(3) and (d)(4) projects that wouldhave to be surveyed by 30%.) We assumed that projects insured under theother programs (207, 213, 220, 223(f), 231 and 234) do not receive subsidyand that all tenants must be surveyed.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Reporting Burden</T4><H1>Number of respondents</H1><H1>andmultiply;</H1><H1>Frequency of response</H1><H1>andmultiply;</H1><H1>House per response</H1><H1>=</H1><H1>Burden hours</H1><H1>Total</H1><ITAG tagnum="21"><T2>One-Time Burden In 1989 For Currently HUD-Held Inventory</T2><R/></ITAG>Project Owners:<ITAG tagnum="2">(HUD 9934) 724<D>andmultiply;</D><D>1</D><D/><D>4</D><D/><D>2,896</D><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">(HUD 9934A) 724<D>andmultiply;</D><D>1</D><D/><D>.25</D><D/><D>181</D><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">(HUD 9934B) 724<D>andmultiply;</D><D>1</D><D/><D>1.5</D><D/><D>1,086</D><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D/><D/><D/><D/><D/><D/><D>4,163</D><ITAG tagnum="1">Tenants: (HUD 9934) 86,913<D>andmultiply;</D><D>1</D><D>andmultiply;</D><D>.066</D><D>=</D><D>5,836</D><D>5,736</D><R>n,n,n,n,n,n,sandCx.3;</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D/><D/><D/><D/><D/><D/><D>9,899</D><R/><ITAG tagnum="21"><T2>Annual Burden For Mortgages Newly Assigned To HUD Or Foreclosed</T2><R/></ITAG>Project Owners:<ITAG tagnum="2">(HUD 9934) 85<D>andmultiply;</D><D>1</D><D>andmultiply;</D><D>4</D><D>=</D><D>340</D><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">(HUD 9934A) 85<D>andmultiply;</D><D>1</D><D>andmultiply;</D><D>1.5</D><D>=</D><D>128</D><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">(HUD 9934B) 85<D>andmultiply;</D><D>1</D><D>andmultiply;</D><D>.25</D><D>=</D><D>21</D><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D/><D/><D/><D/><D/><D/><D>489</D><ITAG tagnum="1">Tenants: (HUD 9934) 9,038<D>andmultiply;</D><D>1</D><D>andmultiply;</D><D>.066</D><D>=</D><D>597</D><D>597</D><R>n,n,n,n,n,n,sandCx.3;</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D/><D/><D/><D/><D/><D/><D>1,086</D><F>\1\ Assuming 75 assignments and 10 foreclosures per year.</F></ITAG>14.
