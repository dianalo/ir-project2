Sir David Wilson on Wednesday delivered anoptimistic review on conditions in Hong Kong, but said problemsexist and they must be solved to retain the prosperity and dynamismof this British colony.   In an annual address opening a new session of the LegislativeCouncil, Hong Kong's chief lawmaking body, Wilson said he wasconfident about the colony's economic growth despite public concernover its return to China in 1997 when a territorial lease expires.   He said Hong Kong's Gross Domestic Product was expected to growby 6 percent this year, or half the 1987 figure, but explained thiswas the result of economic consolidation following earlier years ofdouble digit growth.   ``Hong Kong has prospered over the past decades by maintainingan open economy,'' he said. ``Nevertheless, we have to recognizethat we are dependent not just on ourselves but on the economicperformance of our major overseas markets and on our continuedaccess to them.''   As an example of concern, Wilson singled out an unsuccessfulattempt by the U.S. House of Representatives earlier this month tooverride President Reagan's veto on legislation to tighten curbs ontextile imports to the United States.   ``We must continue to be aware of, and guard against,protectionist sentiment in the U.S. Congress,'' he said.   Hong Kong exported roughly $4.3 billion worth of apparel andtextile goods to the United States last year. It was the singlelargest category in exports that totaled $9.2 billion.   Wilson said Sino-Hong Kong relations are developing well.   Wilson said Hong Kong still faces a problem over theresettlement of Vietnamese boat people, who continue to arrivedespite a government policy to repatriate to Vietnam those regardedas economic migrants and not genuine refugees.   He said 133,00 boat people have arrived in Hong Kong since thefall of Vietnam to the communists in 1975. There are roughly 25,000still in Hong Kong, but Wilson said their rate of resettlement toother countries has dropped sharply in recent years.   ``The tragedy is that doors are no longer open for them,'' hesaid. ``They are people on a journey to nowhere.''</TEXT></DOC>
