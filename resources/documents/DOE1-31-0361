<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-31-0361 </DOCNO><TEXT>Dynamic computed tomography utilizing intravenous contrast agents affordsa unique opportunity to evaluate pathologic vascular states of the cerebrumin cross-section with an imaging system which is more contrast-sensitivethan either conventional film-screen or digital subtraction angiography.Dynamic scanning therefore routinely allows the non-invasive detectionof pathologic vascularity in-vivo in lesions that could previously onlybe detected reliably primarily with in-vitro techniques. The first sectionof this two part report examines the microscopic vascularity observedin active demyelination, inflammatory states, trauma, infarction andother forms of acquired cerebral disease. In the second section, theability of intravenous dynamic cranial computed tomography to detectmacroscopic pathologic vascularity is reviewed. The diagnostic principlesof conventional angiography apply in this technique except that the lesionis viewed in cross-section, rather than in-toto with all structures superimposed.The method therefore yields a true tomographic angiogram. Abnormal vascularstates associated with malignancies, vascular malformations aneurysms,and vascular occlusions are simply evaluated and correlate preciselywith the aberrant vascular patterns revealed angiographically.</TEXT></DOC>
