Hopefully, some of these revenues will be recovered in the futurethrough sale of assets and recovery of funds from the wrongdoers.   Fourth, we plan to increase the budget of the Justice Departmentby approximately $50 million to enable it to create a nationwideprogram to seek out and punish those that have committed wrongdoingin the management of these failed institutions.   These funds will result in almost doubling the personnel devotedto the apprehension and prosecution of individuals committing fraudin our financial markets.   As you can see, these proposals are based upon several overridingprinciples.   First, I will not support any new fee on depositors.   Second, we should preserve the overall federal budget structureand not allow the misdeeds and the wrongdoings of savings and loanexecutives and the inadequacy of their regulation to significantlyalter our overall budget priorities.   And third, I have concluded that this proposal, if promptlyenacted, will enable our system to prevent any repetition of thissituation.   And fourth, I've decided to attack this problem head-on, withevery available resource of our government, because it is a nationalproblem.   I've directed that the combined resources of our federal agenciesbe brought together in a team effort to resolve the problem.   And fifth, I believe that banks and thrifts should pay the realcost of providing the deposit insurance protection.   The price the FDIC charges banks for their insurance has not beenincreased since 1935.   We propose to increase the bank insurance premium by less than 7cents per $100 of insurance protection that they receive.   Every penny collected would be used to strengthen the FDIC sothat the taxpayers will not be called on to rescue it a few yearsfrom now.   And I make you a solemn pledge that we will make every effort torecover assets diverted from these institutions and to place behindbars those who have caused losses through criminal behavior.   Let those who would take advantage of the public trust and put atrisk the savings of American families anticipate that we will seekthem out, pursue them, and demand the most severe penalty.   In closing, I want to just say a word to the small savers ofAmerica.   Across this great land, families and individuals work and save,and we hope to encourage even greater rates of savings to promote abrighter future for our children.   Your government has stood behind the safety of insured depositsbefore.   It does today, and it will do so at all times in the future.   Every insured deposit will be backed by the full faith and creditof the United States of America, which means it will be _ that itwill be absolutely protected.   For the future, we will seek to achieve a safe, sound andprofitable banking system.   However, integrity and prudence must share an equal position withcompetition in our financial markets.   Clean markets are an absolute prerequisite to a free economy andto the public confidence that is its most important ingredient.   I've determined to face this problem squarely and to ask for yoursupport in putting it behind us.   I have ordered that the resources of the executive branch bebrought to bear on cleaning up this problem.   I have personally met with the leadership of Congress on thisissue.   My administration will work cooperatively with Congress as thelegislation that we will submit in a few days' time is considered.   I call on the Congress to join me in a determined effort toresolve this threat to the American financial system permanently,and to do so without delay.</TEXT><HEAD>MORE</HEAD></DOC>
