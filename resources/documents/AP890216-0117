The interim modification would apply only to commercial fishingvessels. But more changes in the year-old ``zero tolerance'' programto combat drug smuggling may be made before formal guidelines areissued, said Ed Callahan, a senior special agent with the CustomsService.   He said officials were discussing whether to extend less strictprocedures to other vessels, such as recreational craft and yachtsand other private boats.   Under policies that went into effect last March, federal agentswere free to seize vessels within 12 miles of the U.S. coastline ifany amount of illegal drugs was found on board _ showing ``zerotolerance.''   Under the newly revized rules, Customs Service or Coast Guardpersonnel would merely issue a summons to a commercial fishingvessel if a personal-use amount of drugs was found while the shipwas engaged in fishing or en route to or from a fishing trip.   Personal-use amounts generally are defined as no more than onegram of heroin or cocaine or one ounce of marijuana.   When large amounts are found, vessels could still be immediatelyforfeited to the government, Callahan said.   Some fishing vessels could be allowed to complete their fishingexpeditions, even if they lasted several days, and then surrender toCustoms authorities who would determine whether the vessels shouldbe seized or a fine imposed.   The interim guidelines, which went into effect Thursday prior toadoption of formal regulations expected in several weeks, alsorequire Customs to act within 20 days on petitions to returnvessels. Officials acknowledge that it has sometimes taken up toseveral weeks for return of vessels where seizure was determine tobe unwarranted.   The new guidelines followed meetings of Customs CommissionerWilliam von Raab with fisheries representatives. Von Raab signed anagreement with the North Carolina and the East Coast Fisheriesassociations in December calling for officials and the industry towork together to see that vessels belonging to association membersare not used to transport illegal drugs into the United States.   Late last year, Congress narrowly approved anti-drug lawmodifications that instructed the executive branch to issue newregulations that would not be so harsh in instances where a ship'scaptain or owner may have no knowledge of a crewmember's possessionof a small quantity of an illegal substance.</TEXT></DOC>
