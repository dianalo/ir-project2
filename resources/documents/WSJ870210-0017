The health care concern's board decided that the proposed takeover isn't in the best interests of its holders. The company added that it &quot;has no interest in pursuing the matter.&quot;    A spokesman for Pesch andamp; Co. declined to comment on American Medical's statement.    Last week, a unit of closely held Pesch proposed the offer for all of American Medical's stock outstanding. At the time, American Medical declined to comment on the proposal, and details were sparse. A spokesman for American Medical said yesterday that the offer was for cash. The proposal raised questions about how the little-known Pesch andamp; Co. would finance the transaction.    Pesch andamp; Co., which has interests in health care, information systems and real estate development, is operated by LeRoy A. Pesch. The company last year led a $406.2 million leveraged buyout of Republic Health Corp., a Dallas-based health-care concern.    American Medical is the nation's fourth-largest hospital chain, with 159 health-care facilities in the U.S. and abroad. It posted wide losses last year and began a reorganization aimed at improving results.    American Medical disclosed that it rejected the offer after the markets closed. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, American Medical closed at $18.75 a share, off 12.5 cents.    Dr. Pesch said last week that he owns about one million shares of American Medical and holds options on two million more shares. American Medical currently has 86.9 million shares outstanding. Dr. Pesch said he had contacted several major shareholders, and while he didn't identify those investors, he said that the Bass family of Fort Worth, Texas, hadn't made any commitments. An investment group that includes members of the Bass family owns 11.4% of American Medical.    Walter L. Weisman, president and chief executive officer of American Medical, said the board &quot;believes this clearly isn't the time to pursue the sale of the company.&quot; The results of a company restructuring &quot;are only beginning to be reflected in the operating results,&quot; he said. In the past year, American Medical has made changes in management and operating structure and has sold or eliminated various operations.    In the first quarter ended Nov. 30, American Medical earned $28.6 million, or 33 cents a share, little changed from the year-earlier $28.7 million, or 33 cents a share. Fiscal first-quarter revenue rose 16% to $931.8 million from $805.2 million.    But the first-quarter profit was a turnaround from the $65.3 million net loss for the fiscal fourth quarter. The fourth-quarter results, which included $127 million in one-time charges, were on revenue of $893.5 million.    Analysts said that American Medical's response left no room for negotiations. Randall Huyser, analyst at San Francisco-based Montgomery Securities, said he believes that Pesch andamp; Co. has had difficulty arranging financing for the proposed takeover. &quot;My guess is that if they can get financing, they will proceed with a hostile bid,&quot; the analyst said. </TEXT></DOC>
