(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   More than two years after a judge ruledthat Mississippi's method of electing judges violated the federalVoting Rights Act, eight blacks are on the ballot in electionsTuesday that could more than double the number of blacks on thebench.   Also on the ballot are three proposed constitutional amendments.One would eliminate the racially motivated, and long-sinceunenforced, poll tax law.   Judicial elections are being held this year because of a federalcourt order forcing judicial districts to be redrawn.   In April 1987, U.S. District Judge William H. Barbour Jr. ofJackson ruled that the state's judicial districts discriminatedagainst blacks. The ruling, which was the first to apply a sectionof the 1965 federal Voting Rights Act to judicial elections, wasupheld by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.   Barbour ordered some districts redrawn to create minoritysubdistricts so that black voters would have a better opportunity toelect black candidates to judicial posts.   The ruling and the appeals process put judicial elections in thestate on hold until this year, when all 69 circuit and chanceryjudgeships are being filled.   Party primaries were held in April, and the winners of Tuedsay'sraces will take office July 3.   Mississippi now has only four black judges among the 78 SupremeCourt, Circuit Court and Chancery Court judges in the state _Supreme Court Justice Reuben Anderson, Circuit Judges Fred L. BanksJr. and Lillie Blackmon-Sanders, and Chancery Judge Isaac Byrd.   Each was appointed to fill a vacancy, but Anderson went on to wina full eight-year term in 1986. Byrd did not seek election to a fullterm this year, and the other two are seeking regular terms Tuesday.   Blackmon-Sanders is opposed by a Republican. Banks and one otherblack Democrat, Isadore W. Patrick, are unopposed in the generalelection.   In other cicuit court and chancery court cases, three blackcandidates are facing incumbents, while two others are vying foropen judgeships where neither candidate is an incumbent.   Chancery courts handle civil lawsuits while circuit courts handlecriminal cases.   One proposed constitutional amendment on the ballot would deletereferences to the levying of a poll tax as a requirement to registerto vote. It also would eliminate the four-month school year and acounty common school fund, which were to be financed from the polltax collections.   The poll tax was aimed at keeping blacks off voter rolls. It hasremained on the books in the state even though it was struck down bythe U.S. Supreme Court in 1966.   Another proposed constitutional amendment would remove theprohibition against out-of-state businesses operating a railroad inMississippi _ all but unenforceable with the demise of localrailroad companies. The third would allow the Legislature moreflexibility in how it proposes future constitutional amendments.</TEXT></DOC>
