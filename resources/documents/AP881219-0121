The restrictions basically are aimed at ensuring China will notbe able to compete unfairly against private American launchcompanies.   The agreement was initialed Saturday by U.S. and Chineserepresentatives. It apparently sets the stage for AsiaSat, aBritish-Chinese consortium, and AUSSAT, an Australian satellitegroup, to have the satellites they plan to purchase in the UnitedStates launched by Chinese rockets.   As part of the agreement, China said it would abide by marketeconomy practices in pricing and insurance and would avoid othergovernment inducements, State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakleysaid.   She said China also agreed to launch no more than ninecommunications satellites during the next six years and todistribute launch commitments proportionately during the agreement.   Mrs. Oakley said the agreement ensures that U.S. nationalsecurity interests will be fully safeguarded.   ``The agreement allows the Chinese to enter the internationalcommercial launch market in accordance with market principles and ina way that will not materially impair the smooth and effectivefunctioning of that market,'' she said.   Martin Marietta Corp., a major rocket manufacturer, said in astatement Monday it is hopeful that the agreement will mean thatChinese participation in satellite launchings will be ``fair andnon-disruptive.''   Whether the agreement serves that purpose depends on thespecifics of how it is implemented, said a company spokeswoman, whoasked not to be identified by name.   She also called for a broad international agreement on commerciallaunch services among the United States, Europe, China and Japan.   ``A level playing field is required if U.S. industry is tocompete and U.S. access is to be assured,'' she said.   No American satellites have ever been launched by a non-Westernor communist country.   In September, when President Reagan approved the plan, U.S.commercial launch companies expressed opposition on grounds theywould not be able to compete with a country that has a state-runrocket program and does not have to make a profit.   The American launch market has picked up since the 1986Challenger tragedy. Afterward, Reagan ordered that the space shuttlebe used only for military and scientific payloads, making privaterocket companies the only alternative for commercial satelliteproducers.</TEXT></DOC>
