From Lake Okeechobee to Key West, rainfall has been running onlyabout 50 percent of its historic average since December.   Combine that with temperatures consistently in the low 80s, atleast 5 degrees hotter than normal, and you have the makings of adrought.   ``You might as well call it the south Florida desert,'' saysHenry LaRose, a hydrologist with the U.S. Geological Survey officein Fort Myers. ``The trouble is, things are going to get worsebefore they get better.''   That's because the region is in the midst of its cyclicalwinter-spring dry season that doesn't end until June, when afternoonshowers and hurricane-fed storms become the norm.   Rainfall was slightly below normal last summer, and the droughtbegan to take hold around October.   ``What we've had this year is three or four very dry monthsbefore the dry season even started,'' said Steve Lamb, water-usedirector for the South Florida Water Management District. ``Now wedon't have any substantial rain to look forward to for months.''   ``Normal rain of two inches a month isn't going to solve it,'' headded. ``We need several days of soaking rain.''   Lake Okeechobee, the 714-square-mile heart of the region's watersystem and its primary source of drinking water, has been droppingsteadily since last April and could reach a critically low depth of10 feet by the end of May, according to water district spokeswomanAnne Overton. The lowest level on record came during the drought of1981, when the lake dipped to 9.75 feet.   Mandatory water-use restrictions already have been imposed on theGulf Coast resort of Marco Island, in parts of coastal Lee Countyand in northern Palm Beach and Martin counties.   ``It's not unusual to have water-use cutbacks _ what's unusual isto have them so early in the year,'' Lamb said. ``As far as waterlevels go, this is what we're used to seeing in late April and May _not February.''   Southwest Florida homeowners who depend on backyard wells fortheir water needs are beginning to come up dry with groundwaterlevels as much as 8 feet below what they were two years ago.   The lack of rain is also having an impact on the Everglades,which despite some flows of water from Lake Okeechobee is alreadystarting to show subtle signs of spring-like dryness. Areas on thefringe of Everglades National Park that are usually covered in waterare now too dry to ride an airboat across and some parts of thewetlands are hard enough to walk on.   A major concern from the dryness is wildfires, which tore throughthe Everglades and every region of the state in 1981 and 1985. Ineach of those years at least 150,000 acres were blackened andhundreds of homes destroyed.   ``We're not only expecting a busy year, we've already got a busyyear,'' said David Utley, district administrator for the stateDivision of Forestry. ``We normally only had four fires a week, nowwe're running out to two or three a day.''   Even though the fire season doesn't officially begin until March,state firefighters already have responded to 72 fires this year,Utley said.   ``We're preparing to step everything up to suppress the big fireswe expect in March and April,'' Utley said.   ``Most of the time we just watch the fire to make sure it doesn'tget too close to a road or a populated area,'' said forestry dutyofficer Peter Karayeanes. ``We let it burn itself out so we don'thave to go into the same spot anytime soon.''   Significant rain is the only hope of turning the dry spellaround, but long-range forecasts from the National Weather Servicegive little hope for relief. They call for more of the same:temperatures above normal, rainfall below.</TEXT></DOC>
