O'Brien added that it has signed a 20-year contract with Acme, guaranteeing to provide electricity and steam at lower rates than Acme would get from local utilities or by producing it itself. The energy-product developer said annual gross revenue from the facility is expected to be about $5 million.    O'Brien said the plant, which it expects to finish by late 1991, would be capable of producing 12.2 megawatts of electricity and 100,000 pounds of steam an hour. </TEXT></DOC>
