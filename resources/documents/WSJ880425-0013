The announcement Friday follows a court ruling earlier last week dissolving a preliminary injunction that had prevented the IRS from taking such action.    Les Witmer, a spokesman for the IRS regional office here, said the action was taken because, &quot;We felt the organization has not operated within the guidelines . . . in its original charter.&quot;    He said court papers filed in conjunction with PTL's bankruptcy proceedings indicated that individuals in the organization had profited substantially from donations and that PTL had &quot;excessive unrelated business income or income which was not really in keeping with the tax-exempt purpose.&quot;    Linda Ivey, a PTL spokeswoman, said ministry officials were not immediately available for comment.    An IRS statement said the agency &quot;can no longer assure taxpayers of the deductibility of contributions to PTL,&quot; effective immediately, but that past contributions are fully deductible. If PTL appeals the action, contributions by individuals would still be deductible up to $1,000 until the appeal is decided.    PTL's troubles began in March 1987 when its founder, Jim Bakker, resigned amid allegations of sexual improprieties. The ministry, based in Fort Mill, S.C., filed for reorganization in federal bankruptcy court in June 1987. </TEXT></DOC>
