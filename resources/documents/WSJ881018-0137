GE Information Services will provide hardware, maintenance, software, documentation and network-based application. The system also offers two-way communications between franchisers and franchisees through the electronic messaging capability.    Mr. Chatterley said the system combines a variety of capabilities under one system. He said the software would cost a minimum of about $200, and that the hardware fee varies depending on the system. There will also be a fee of $100 a month and up for network service, Mr. Chatterley said. </TEXT></DOC>
