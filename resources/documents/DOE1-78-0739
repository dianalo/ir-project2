This projectconsidered the design, cost and benefit of equipment modifications andadditions which would decrese secondary cycle impurity transport. Improvingcondenser integrity, adding full-flow condensate polishers, providinglow dissolved oxygen in makeup water and installation of all-ferrousheat exchangers are four changes that can significantly improve secondarywater quality. Conceptual designs and costs of these four concepts ata 1160 MWe pressurized water reactor are summarized. The expected chemistryand operational benefits are discussed, and a cost-benefit analysis isgiven.</TEXT></DOC>
