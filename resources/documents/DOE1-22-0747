In the puregauge case these are described by a two-dimensional massive photon carryinga twist in the magnetic flux tube. These twists can decay by a two dimensionalinstanton. With fermions the twist mode has a vacuum current of the brokenU(1) symmetry running along the zero of the Higgs field. The case ofbosonic charge carriers, where the charge is also that of the brokenU(1), is then presented. There are world sheet solitons acting as a sourceof twist, and for certain coupling the vortex has a non-cylindricallysymmetric profile. These phenomena have relevance to cosmic string modelsand possibly other areas of physics.</TEXT></DOC>
