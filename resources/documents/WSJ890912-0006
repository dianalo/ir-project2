He said Carolco's share could be half of that.    &quot;Foreign television revenues are the biggest growth area in the business,&quot; said Mr. Hoffman. &quot;This will improve our profitability by a material amount.&quot; The new venture is called Carolco Paravision Television International V.O.F.    Carolco finances, produces and leases motion pictures, including action pictures such as &quot;Rambo III.&quot; Paravision, which is 75%-owned by L'Oreal, controls TV and video rights for a library of 3,500 feature films -- one of the largest libraries in Europe. Carolco will contribute the foreign distribution rights for 50 films to the joint venture, and each company will collect revenues on its own films.    The announcement comes at a tumultuous time for Carolco. Some of the company's negotiations have been complicated by a slide in its stock price following the murders of Live Entertainment Inc.'s chairman and his wife last month. Carolco owns 49% of the Van Nuys, Calif., distributor and retailer of video and audio equipment.    Live Entertainment's chairman, Jose E. Menendez, and his wife, Kitty, were found murdered in their Beverly Hills mansion on Aug. 20, and questions have been raised about a possible connection to organized crime. Live Entertainment bought two companies from individuals identified by law enforcement officials as having alleged ties to organized crime.    Mr. Hoffman said the venture with Paravision brings &quot;an added element of legitimacy at a time when we need it.&quot; The fact that L'Oreal and Paravision &quot;picked Carolco instead of some other company . . . affirms their commitment to us.&quot;    Carolco shares closed yesterday at $9.125, down 12.5 cents, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. On the Friday before the murder, the stock closed at $10.25.    Separately, Live Entertainment has scheduled a meeting with analysts in New York tomorrow to discuss the company's prospects. Live Entertainment closed yesterday at $16 a share, down 25 cents, in over-the-counter trading. On the Friday before the murder, the stock closed at $21.    Mr. Hoffman said Carolco still expects to acquire the assets of De Laurentiis Entertainment Group Inc. for &quot;a little&quot; more than $33 million in cash and stock. Carolco has been in a bidding war for the troubled entertainment group with Italian financier Giancarlo Parretti, but Mr. Hoffman said yesterday that Mr. Parretti has withdrawn from the bidding. Mr. Parretti, who was understood to have made a bid valued at $39.5 million for the assets of De Laurentiis, couldn't be reached for comment.    Before the murders, Carolco was also negotiating the purchase of an unidentified company in a transaction that could have involved some Live Entertainment stock. The status of that deal -- which hadn't been announced but &quot;was extremely close&quot; to completion -- is now &quot;very unclear,&quot; Mr. Hoffman said. &quot;I don't know whether we would proceed. We aren't prepared to distribute Live common stock at these prices to anyone.&quot;    Also before the murders, Andrew Vajna, Carolco's co-chairman, was negotiating the sale of his 36% stake in the company to Mario Kassar, the company's other co-chairman, in a transaction that had a market value of roughly $110 million. Mr. Kassar also holds a 36% stake. Mr. Hoffman said those negotiations are continuing but have been modified as a result of the drop in share prices. He declined to provide any details.    Messrs. Kassar and Vajna haven't been available for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
