Manuel Antonio Noriega. The militarystrongman again rejected a U.S. call for him to go into exile.   Panamanians by the tens of thousands stayed off their jobs todayand Noriega's opponents hailed the success of the work stoppage,predicting it would continue until the general leaves the country.   ``We're in this to the end,'' said Pierre Legnadier, one of theleaders of a coalition of business, professional, labor andpolitical groups that called the strike.   But Noriega appeared unwilling to step down.   ``I am a Panamanian not a gringo,'' Noriega said Tuesday aftermeeting with a small group of union supporters. ``Let the worldknow we are fighting the ultimate battle for dignity and againstcolonialism.''   An estimated 90 percent of offices and industries were shut bythe strike on Tuesday. Most shops and stores were closed, publictransportation was halted and many government employees did not goto work.   Panamanians today prepared to bury the first person to die in awave of protests against the military strongman and oppositionleaders warned of more clashes at the funeral.   The United States is using economic pressure against Noriega,withholding payments for use of the Panama Canal and freezingPanamanian accounts in U.S. banks to starve the government of thedollars it uses as its currency.   The government must meet several major payrolls by the end ofthe month, including that of the 15,000-strong Defense Forces,which Noriega heads.   Between the cash crunch and the strike, the latest in a seriesof walkouts that began last summer to protest Noriega's allegedcorruption, food has grown scarce.   Eric Arturo Delvalle, who was removed as president Feb. 26 aftertrying to fire Noriega, appealed for international food aid Tuesday.   ``I am very concerned and fear for the health and lives of manyPanamanians,'' Delvalle said in a videotaped message from hiding.The United States still recognizes him as Panama's president.   Relief officials said that more and more hungry families, someof whom have not eaten in five or six days, were flocking toemergency centers around the country. And port workers said theyhad run out of food for their union members, but voted to stay onstrike.   Opposition leaders scheduled a funeral today for a man who diedafter being hit with a shotgun blast in violent anti-Noriegaprotests last week. It was the first fatality of the monthlongcrisis that began after U.S. grand juries in Florida indictedNoriega on charges of trafficking in Colombian cocaine.   Opposition leaders say the funeral and the arrival of an exiledoppositon leader could provoke confrontations with Noreiga'sforces. The head of the opposition Christian Democractic Party,Ricardo Arias Calderon was scheduled to arrive from Miami onThursday with a group of Central American legislators.   Noriega's government refused to let Arias Calderon come homefrom a trip after the crisis began.   In Washington, President Reagan said Tuesday that ``we feelNoriega should leave Panama.''   Last week, Noriega turned down a U.S. plan for him to leavePanama and live in Spain. Reagan adminstration officials said theyhad offered to fly the general, family members and friends intoexile.   On Monday, the general said he would resign before next year'spresidential elections if the opposition would agree to a vaguelydefined national dialogue. The opposition scoffed at the offer andvowed to keep up the strike.   ``The strength of the strike is increasing,'' Jose Mulino, anattorney and leader of National Civic Crusade, the oppositioncoalition, said Tuesday.   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said the oppositionrejection of Noreiga's offer was a clear message the strongmanshould resign.   ``The message from Panama is clear,'' he said. ``For the good ofPanama, Noriega should leave.''</TEXT></DOC>
