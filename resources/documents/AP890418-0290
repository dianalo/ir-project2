Boeing Co. is the major beneficiary of the orders, GPA said. Itsaid it will buy 182 Boeing airplanes for $9.4 billion.   GPA said it will buy 92 of the Seattle-based manufacturer's 737narrow-bodied, twin-jet planes, 50 Boeing 757 narrow-bodiedtwin-jet models, and 40 Boeing 767 twin-engine wide-bodied jets.   In addition, GPA said it will purchase for $3.1 billion 64McDonnell Douglas Corp. MD-80 narrow-body twin-jets and 8 McDonnellDouglas MD-11 wide-body, three-engine jets, it said.   The company announced earlier today in Paris that it also wasordering $4.3 billion worth of airplanes from Airbus Industrie, theEuropean consortium. It will buy 30 of Airbus Industries' A320s; 10A330s; and two A340s. It said it also has placed options to take afurther 10 A330s and two A340s.   At a news conference in New York, GPA Chairman and ChiefExecutive T.A. Ryan said the company plans to take delivery of 80to 100 new planes a year over the next six to seven years.   ``For the first time, it provides massive flexibility for theairlines and particularly the smaller carriers,'' Ryan said. ``Theairline business is going to increase and the number of passengersis going to increase very dramatically.''   He noted the airlines' growing use of operating leases foraircraft, which average 6{ years for GPA.   Ryan said the financing for the purchases will be provided by agroup of U.S. and Japanese banks led by Citibank.   GPA said the engine suppliers include CFMI, a joint venture ofGeneral Electric Co. of the United States and France's SocieteNationale d'Etudes et Construction de Moteurs Aviation; GeneralElectric; United Technologies Corp.'s Pratt and Whitney;Rolls-Royce PLC, and International Aero Engines, jointly owned byUnited Technologies, Daimler-Benz AG and Rolls-Royce.   The announcement had been expected. The company said last weekthat it planned to disclose big orders today.   The previous largest order was Delta Air Lines' $10.5 billionworth of orders for and options on 225 Boeing and McDonnell-Douglasairplanes last September.   GPA's order reflects the importance of aircraft leasingcompanies, which account for about one-fifth of all aircraftorders. It also underscores the growth of the airline industry plusairlines' concern with replacing their aging fleets.   Leasing companies provide airplanes to airlines whichincreasingly do not want, or do not have the money, to buy theairplanes themselves.   Some airlines have complained that the leasing companies' rolein the industry has boosted airplane prices and is lenthening thelong waiting lists for aircraft.   GPA, based in Shannon, Ireland and formerly called Guinness PeatAviation, is privately owned by several companies, including theairlines Air Canada and Aer Lingus. The carriers hold stakes of 16percent and 11 percent, respectively.   GPA currently owns or leases 172 aircraft operated by 64carriers in 32 countries.   Its net profits for 1988-1989 were expected to total $150million compared with $101 million in the previous fiscal year.</TEXT></DOC>
