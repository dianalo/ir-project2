Efforts are focusedon novel methods to achieve the following: (1) combined carbon oxidation/nitrogenremoval, and (2) a high-rate biological oxidation reactor. A third effortwill examine pretreatment requirements for the discharge of gasificationeffluents to publicly-owned treatment works. To date work has focusedon biological fluidized bed treatment of gasification wastewater. Thewastewater used for this research is stripped gas liquor (SGL) from theGreat Plains Gasification Plant near Beulah, North Dakota. Bench scaletests using the conventional upflow fluidization mode, with sand as themedia, has demonstrated the applicability of the coupled process forcombined carbon and nitrogen removal from SGL. A second bench scale coupledreactor tested a modified fluidization technique. The media used waslow specific gravity spheres. Fluidization was achieved by adding thewastewater at the top of the bed, with the media fluidizing downwards.This fluidization method requires less recycle to maintain fluidizationthan the conventional upflow mode, resulting in energy savings. A processdevelopment unit has been constructed in the downflow mode for furthertesting and development of process performance and kinetic data. Resultsof these tests are discussed. 4 references, 6 figures, 1 table.</TEXT></DOC>
