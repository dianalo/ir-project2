PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The United States' resumption of chemical weaponsproduction sabotaged talks on banning the arms, Foreign MinisterEduard A. Shevardnadze charged Monday.   British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe told Shevardnadzethe West will not settle for a Soviet advantage in mobile nuclearmissiles or conventional or chemical arms.   The West wants to see more evidence of Soviet leader Mikhail S.Gorbachev's ``new thinking'' in foreign policy, said Howe, whoarrived Sunday for a brief visit. He is to meet with Gorbachev onTuesday.   ``We in the West will be happier with (the USSR) when we canpoint to concrete evidence that new thinking does in practice makethe Soviet Union an easier neighbor,'' Howe said at a luncheonShevardnadze held in his honor on Monday. A text of his remarks wasmade available to The Associated Press.   The Soviet foreign minister urged a ban on chemical weapons,saying they are ``the only weapon of mass destruction which is mostprobably intended for use in the area from the Atlantic to theUrals.''   Last December the United States began producing binary chemicalweapons, which produce a toxin by combining two relatively harmlessagents, following an 18-year moratorium on production of chemicalweapons.   Talks on a worldwide ban on chemical weapons were close toconcluding with an agreement before the U.S. decision to beginproducing binary weapons, Shevardnadze said.   ``The binary sabotage, and it cannot be described in any otherway, may push us ... to a new spiral of the chemical arms race,''said Shevardnadze, according to the Tass news agency.   ``Binary weapons, in our judgment, precisely mark the boundaryline between the interests of the United States and its Europeanallies. Not an imaginary boundary, but the one inherent in thecapabilities of these weapons and their delivery vehicles,''Shevardnadze said.   In his speech, Howe said Western Europeans are deeply concernedabout their security now that the United States and Soviet Unionhave agreed to eliminate intermediate-range nuclear weapons.   ``They see Soviet pressure for a nuclear-free Europe, which inreality means a nuclear-free Western Europe, with our Easternneighbors still in possession of a large mobile nuclear arsenal, inaddition to your preponderance in conventional and chemicalweapons,'' the British foreign secretary said.   Howe dismissed what he called ``any artificial linkage'' betweena U.S.-Soviet agreement to cut strategic weapons and the U.S.``Star Wars'' program.   Disputes over President Reagan's plan for a space-based shieldagainst nuclear attack still stand in the way of an agreement tocut both sides' arsenals of long-range nuclear missiles by 50percent.   U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz will be discussing thatissue with Soviet leaders after he arrives in Moscow on Sunday.   Howe ruled out any negotiation with the Soviet Union overBritish and French nuclear forces, urged Soviet support forsanctions against Iran to end the Iran-Iraq war and welcomedGorbachev's announcement last week of a timetable for removingSoviet soldiers from Afghanistan.   Howe and Shevardnadze signed an agreement Monday committingtheir countries to working together to fight drug abuse andtrafficking.   Shevardnadze and Howe last met Dec. 7 at Brize Norton Royal AirBase, where Gorbachev stopped off on his way to Washington. TheSoviet leader and Reagan signed an agreement to eliminate theirintermediate-range nuclear weapons.</TEXT></DOC>
