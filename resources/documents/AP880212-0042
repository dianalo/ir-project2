DavidBonior, D-Mich., the chief deputy House whip, wrote in a letter toReagan.   White House chief of staff Howard H. Baker Jr. and nationalsecurity adviser Colin L. Powell on Wednesday issued a memorandumdirecting that ``no administration official should provideassistance or encouragement of any kind'' to such fund-raisingefforts.   But Bonior said the memo was addressed only to White House andNational Security Council staff members, and not to officials ofthe State Department, Pentagon and the CIA.   ``If the White House intentionally excepted the CIA, Defense andState departments, they are laying the groundwork for anotherIran-Contra scandal,'' Bonior said in a statement.   During last summer's congerssional hearings into the Iran-Contraarms and money affair, activities by White House and StateDepartment officials to raise money for the Contras, includingthose of Lt. Col. Oliver L. North, became a focus of concern overthe ``privatization'' of U.S. foreign policy.   In the memo, Baker and Powell said ``no administration officialshould take a position for or against private support for thedemocratic resistance'' and that officials should discouragediscussions of the subject at meetings where they are present.   Contra leaders have said they were actively seeking privatemonetary support.   Meanwhile, Reagan declined an invitation from congressionalleaders to participate in the drafting of a package of strictly``humanitarian'' aid to the Contras to take the place of the $36million administration package, which included military aid, killedby the House on Feb. 4.   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, and other Democratic leadershad written Reagan on Tuesday to ask for his suggestions, butReagan wrote back Thursday that he would not offer ideas, but onlyreact to any proposal Congress might draft.   ``The outlines of an acceptable package must provide sufficientaid to sustain the freedom fighters in order to maintain thosepressures that have moved the peace process forward,'' Reagan wrote.   The statement seemed a clear indication that the administrationwill insist on aid that would keep the rebels active as a fightingforce.   ``Without immediate action by the Congress, the freedom fighterswill become recklessly exposed, and may soon have to makeirreversible decisions about their own future,'' Reagan said in theletter. ``Even as I write this letter, we have reliable reports ofnew Soviet military shipments to Nicaragua.''   Current U.S. aid for the rebels, including authority for the CIAto make air drops to fighters in the field inside Nicaragua, endsFeb. 29.   In a speech Thursday night to a conservative political group,Reagan vowed that ``the curtain hasn't fallen'' on aid to therebels.   ``We're not giving up on those who are fighting for theirfreedom, and they aren't giving up either,'' Reagan said.   Asked Friday what the administration intends to do, White Housespokesman Marlin Fitzwater said: ``If we can't reach an agreement(with the Democrats), we will have our own package.''   Fitzwater said no decision has been made whether anadministration package would contain military aid, adding, ``Firstof all, we want to see what the speaker (Wright) produces.''   Fitzwater said that by the end of February there will be anothervote in Congress on aid _ either the Democratic plan or anadministration package.</TEXT></DOC>
