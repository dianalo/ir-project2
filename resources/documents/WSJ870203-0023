Jack Friedman, chairman, Harold Friedman, president, and Henry Spira, a director, the controlling shareholders with a combined stake of 50%, have agreed to vote their shares in favor of the transaction, the company said. Completion of the acquisition is subject to approval by shareholders at a special meeting. The company, a processor of steel coils and pipes, said a date for the meeting hasn't been set. The company currently has about 3.6 million shares outstanding.    Mr. Castellvi couldn't be reached for comment. Harold Friedman said the company believes the offer is a fair price given the depressed conditions in the local economy. For its second quarter ended Sept. 30, Friedman posted a 41% decline in net income to $425,557, or 12 cents a share, from $726,436, or 20 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales fell 3.1% to $11.6 million from $12 million, a year earlier.    In American Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Friedman closed at $9.50, up 62.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
