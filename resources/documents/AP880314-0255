But Earth First! founder David Foremancompares his style of civil disobedience with that of MohandasGandhi or Dr. Martin Luther King.</TEXT><BYLINE>By SUE CROSS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   From their seats in a Juneau conferencehall, some 400 people tip their noses toward the rafters and letout a long, high-pitched howl.   With scarcely a giggle, they howl their scorn atwilderness-wrecking development, howl their devotion to DavidForeman's controversial brand of environmentalism.   Wolf mimicry is among the more benign of Foreman'sattention-grabbing tricks, which some call criminal, others callvisionary.   It's the stuff of Earth First!, the self-styled radical fringeof environmentalism founded by Foreman in 1980 when he decided themovement was boring itself out of existence.   Since then, Earth Firsters have been putting themselves on frontpages, infuriating loggers and frustrating law enforcementofficials with their ``civil disobedience'' protests.   They shackle themselves to trees, stage sit-ins before bulldozerblades, pour sand in the engines of earthmovers and pound spikes intree trunks to mangle loggers' saws.   They call the practice monkeywrenching.   In the eyes of the Alaska Loggers Association, Foreman and hisfollowers are ``terrorists.'' Foreman prefers to compare himself toMohandas Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr.   He says sabotaging equipment isn't terrorism because it doesn'thurt people.   ``I think that I believe in non-violence, too,'' he says.``Pulling up survey stakes, putting sand in the crank case of abulldozer, those aren't violent.''   Though opponents often link Earth First! to an accident inCalifornia in which a sawmill worker was hurt by a tree spike thatstruck a saw blade, Foreman says conservationists were not involved.   Foreman, who makes his home in Tucson, Ariz., has been arrestedseveral times. Dozens of Earth First! members were charged withcriminal mischief and similar crimes for anti-logging protests inOregon last summer.   Over the past few years they've blockaded oil wells, occupieduranium mines and joined Greenpeace at nuclear test protests inNevada.   If people see him going to jail for his cause, Foreman says,maybe they'll take environmentalism more seriously.   ``Sometimes you've got to put your body on the line,'' Foremansays. ``Face it. There are a lot of madmen and madwomen out theredestroying the earth. Why shouldn't we be mad about it? Whyshouldn't we be passionate?   ``We need to scare people. It's not our job to come up with thefinal, politically acceptable solution. We're advocates.''   For all its radical tone, Foreman's activism has itsunderpinnings in conventional political strategy.   At a how-to workshop on promoting the environmental cause, heexplained he doesn't really expect the general public to adopt allhis views. By presenting an extreme, he simply hopes to shift theultimate compromise his way.   ``There are rational solutions, but others should find them,''he said. ``I see very few politicians respond to facts. I seepoliticians respond to votes, to public opinion. We compromise andwe sort of water down our opinions before ever speaking them.''   He tells a class how to use self-deprecating jokes _ aspoliticians do _ to make the audience think they're regular guys.   He advises his students not to dread a knowledgeable audience.``If you relax, you can sound like you know a lot more aboutsomething than you do.''   Passing out pamphlets? Dress up in animal costumes and stage askit, he says. You'll be harder to ignore.   And when you're really in an adversarial position, Foreman says,remember ``They can't beat you up quite as much if they'relaughing.''   It was Foreman's talent for humor and drama that brought him aninvitation to speak at the Alaska Environmental Assembly's recentconference in Juneau.   The assembly got the theater it wanted as he sermonized.   First came the doomsday predictions: ``1988 is the greatestbiological crisis since evolution began 3{ billion years ago,''Foreman says. ``By the year 2,000 the only large mammals left willbe the ones we allow to exist.''   Then the promise of salvation: This generation is the mostimportant that ever lived, he says, the generation that can haltenvironmental destruction.   Then the underlying moral: Biocentrism, Foreman says, is themost important philosophy of man. It holds that you can't changeone part of the world without affecting every other, that a crab inthe mud has as much right to life as a man.   And, finally, the call to give up worldly goods, to choosewilderness over drinking more Coke, buying more VCRs, figuring thevalue of something ``by how many greasy bills you can pile up nextto it.''   Forget about building more highways and bring back the bisoninstead, Foreman says. Look beneath skyscrapers and opera houses tosee ``a vision of the world the way it could be.''   Be an animal, he advises, closing with the howl, 400 voicesstrong.   So how does Foreman suggest modernized Americans get back to thebison?   ``I don't have all the answers,'' he says after the speech. ``Ithink that's one of the problems, that we think we have to have allthe answers. But I want to energize people to ask the questions.''   Foreman says giving up all modern ways for an ecologically soundStone Age is not the idea. He'd settle for a shift toward theprimitive side.   ``I believe in compromise and balance. We're protectingsomething like 3 percent of the land of the United States aswilderness. I don't think that's balance. I would be satisfied with20 or 30 percent.''   The conservationists who work to reach those compromisessometimes seem unsure how to react to Foreman's flamboyance.   Some Juneau environmentalists were titillated. ``Did you knowyou're sitting behind a terrorist?'' one lobbyist stage-whispered arow behind Foreman, who was giggling at the furor his visit hadstirred.   Loggers and state Natural Resources Commissioner Judy Bradyboycotted the meeting because of Foreman's presence.   Others mixed admiration with a tinge of embarrassment.   Bart Koehler, a leader of the Southeast Alaska ConservationCoalition, was Foreman's partner in founding Earth First!, butreturned to more conventional environmental groups in 1982.   Though they've been best friends since 1973 and remain so,Koehler doesn't like to be reminded of his ties to Foreman.   Foreman isn't offended. Being environmentalism's bad boy, hesays, has its political purpose.   ``I think we help other environmental groups look mainstream andreasonable _ which they are _ but I think we've helped move themtoward taking a stronger position,'' he says.</TEXT><NOTE>END ADV for Sunday, March 27</NOTE></DOC>
