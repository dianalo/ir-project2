(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Opening WindowsandM;Microsoft's Windows has been slow getting off the ground, but things arestarting to look up for the DOS alternative to OS/2 Presentation Manager.andM;One reason for the slow uptake has been the absence of a 'killer app' thatonce and for all demonstrates the superiority of Windows over text-basedapplications.andP;  Excel, SuperBase 2, PageMaker and others are now reachingcritical mass.andM;Also missing have been utilities to customize the Windows environment,especially the abysmal MS-DOS Executive front-end.andP;  who wants to look at anencyclopaedic list of filenames in a graphical user interface?andM;Here are four packages that add that extra bit of comfort and attractivenessto plain vanilla Windows.andM;Wang ClearViewandM;Wang ClearView fixes the file list MSS-DOS Executive by substituting anicon-based menu system for the basic set of Windows applications.andP;  Instead ofsearching out PAINT.EXE from an alphabetical list, there's a palette icon todouble click on.andP;  A layout feature lets you save your favourite window andapplications arrangement and restore it by auto-pilot.andM;ClearView comes on both 3-1/2-inch and 5-1/4-inch disks.andP;  Installation is asimple matter of clicking on the drive icon that holds the disk and doubleclicking on INSTALL.EXE.andP;  The file copying is done automatically andpermission is humbly asked to amend the path command in your AUTOEXEC.BATfile.andM;After you run autoexec to reset the path, you can double click on CLEARVW.EXEto get the ball rolling.andP;  The dreary file list is instantly replaced by aREADME.TXT icon and a filing cabinet labelled applications.andP;  README tells youstuff you probably already know about Windows and ClearView, but the filingcabinet icon gives you access to the half-screen full of the different iconsrepresenting the standard Windows applications: Write, Paint, Calculator,Calendar and so on.andM;The ClearView documentation is excellent and includes a quick start forknow-it-alls, a step-wise guide for novices, a complete tutorial and areference section.andP;  It's unfortunate that, from the documents, there's no wayto add your own icons for your favourite Windows applications like Excel orAmi, although once started and minimized, they will reside along the bottomedge or wherever you like, as usual.andM;My real affection for ClearView isn't for the iconic menu but for its setupauto pilot.andP;  Everybody has their own deskset preferences.andP;  I happen to likethe calculator and clock at the ready and having Excel and Ami cranked up andrunning.andM;I also want the MS-DOS Executive iconized away in a corner.andP;  Doing this everytime I start Windows is tedious.andM;Along comes ClearView with its Save and Restore Layout feature and lets thePC to the work.andP;  Save and Restore is accessed from the control menu boxWindow Organizer or by clicking on WINORG.EXE.andP;  The Windows Organizer alsoallows you to deal with a text list of applications for closing, minimizingor restoring multiple windows automatically.andM;If you use Windows run, don't walk, to your nearest dealer and get ClearView.andM;hDC Windows ColorandM;Yes, it's another one of those products from a US company that can't bebothered reprinting its packaging to suit our quaint olde worlde spellingconventions.andM;Windows Color (sic) is an enhanced display driver for Windows.andP;  It doesn'tmake Windows run any faster, its lot in life is to just make it lookprettier.andP;  While I can personally start Windows without gagging at thehorrible colours, some users, perhaps those who use a Windows application forpresentation purposes, could use a bit more versatility.andM;Windows Color gives you 16 colours instead of eight from a palette of 64 forEGA and VGA displays.andP;  You get to choose which 16, too.andP;  Every Windowsapplication you run has access to the colours chosen.andM;Installing Windows Color requires the reinstallation of Windows.andP;  Appropriatewarnings about saving artfully crafted WIN.INI files are given.andP;  Havinginstalled Windows on more PCs than I care to think about, I've built up anattitude of resignation about doing it now and in the future.andP;  For others theidea involves stark terror.andM;The only documentation for Windows Color is a README.TXT file on the disk anda few words on the cardboard folder the disk comes wrapped in.andM;The major difference when installing Windows for use with Windows Color isselecting Other Device Driver in the video selection menu.andP;  If you have asuper whizz-bang video card like a Video 7 VRAM VGA or an Interquadram GTi,this means that you have to use the hDC display driver instead.andP;  A carefulcomparison of features will lead you to the right choice.andM;Once the drudgery of installation is over, Windows Color is a snap to use.andO;With a bit of mouse dragging, you can customize your colour palette to yourheart's content.andP;  Funny, I preferred the original more than any of themutations I induced.andP;  Getting back to the standard colours is as simple asclicking the standard dialogue box.andM;If you need more colour in you Windows than Microsoft saw fit to include,this slim package may be for you.andM;hDC Windows ExpressandM;Another package from the US company hDC, presse up against the bulwarks ofMicrosoft in Redmond, Washington.andP;  Express gives you a highly mutable menusystem to replace the awful MS-DOS Executive and its remorseless list offiles.andM;Unlike the Wang package, Windows Express uses a nested set of menus toaccomplish its work.andP;  The menus can be embellished with icons of your owndesign.andM;Windows Express allows you to organize your applications and other files intofolders.andP;  Each menu entry can be password protected.andP;  You can also write yourown dialogue boxes for user input.andM;Installing Windows Express is as simple as most other non-copy protectedsoftware.andP;  Express can be run by double clicking on its filename in theMS-DOS Executive list or by using EXPRESS as an argument when startingWindows from a batch file.andM;You are greeted by a main menu with icons, single key triggers and text linesdescribing each entry.andP;  Clicking on Desktop Applications gives you the nextlevel menu that lists the usual Windows accessories like Calculator and soon.andP;  The main menu is pre-configured with all manner of Windows applicationsso that you can instantly see how it all works before you set it up with yourown library of applications.andM;The User's Guide is well illustrated and takes you step-by-step throughinstallation and a tutorial.andP;  The meat of the documents is found in aseparate Editor User's guide.andM;Window Express Editor is how you can reconfigure Express to include only yourown applications and files and engage the security features.andP;  Editor'sfunctions include creating, deleting and moving items, making help screens,passwords, designing icons and setting defaults.andM;What you're doing with Editor is programming the Express user interface.andO;But, it's about the most painless way to generate code yet invented.andP;  TheProgram Item Editor and Folder Item Editor bring a fill-in-the-blank solutionto completely reconfigure the package.andP;  Security is provided by placingindividual items under password protection as well as the Editor itself.andP;  TheMS-DOS Executive can be disabled as well.andM;I'm not too terribly arty, but using the Icon Editor was easy, especiallysince a library of icons was furnished for customization.andM;Windows Express justifies the effort required to mould a set of menus to anoffice's or department's way of doing things.andP;  It starts to show the promisedadvantage of WIMPS.andM;hDC Windows ManagerandM;The third member of the hDC trio provides a slew of small utilityapplications -- MicroApps -- to add additional function to Windows.andM;Alarm Clock lets you set three alarms and flashes you a note and gives you abeep if you are still in Windows.andP;  Auto Save is redundant for all intents andpurposes because most power applications worth their salt have this featureanyway.andP;  It doesn't work at all if the application you're using isn't aWindows application.andM;Desktop gives you options for controlling the Windows startup effect (zoom,fade or coalesce) and a background picture, pattern or colour -- which ismere Window dressing.andP;  There's a screen save feature to help prevent allthose precious pixels from burning out.andM;Font Viewer does just what you would think it would do for both screen andprinter fonts.andP;  Memory Viewer shows you in pie or bar graph form just whatall your lovely megabytes are doing.andM;The System Enhancer MicroApp gives a better handle than Microsoft, providedfor arranging windows or closing all windows at once.andP;  The best of the lot,however, is the Works Sets MicroApp which duplicates the layout function ofWang's ClearView, but in a less friendly way.andM;There isn't anything here that you couldn't live without, but it does providean interesting assortment of functions for the Windows fanatic.andM;There's an implied promise of more MicroApps to follow.andP;  Don't hold yourbreath waiting for the whole world to clasp the concept to their bosom, buthDC might supplement this line-up in the future.andM;USER VERDICTandM;* PRODUCT NAME hDC Windows ColorandM;* SUPPLIER Frontline Distribution, Intec 1, Wade Road, Basingstoke, HampshireRD22 ONE.andP;
