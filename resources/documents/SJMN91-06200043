There was and is no othermotivation for the lawsuit. A judge has already issued the order requested bythe Public Interest Law Firm requiring the county to comply with state law andlimit to 90 the number of children at the shelter.;    In a recent letter tothe editor, Jeff Fortin from the Social Services Agency described the lawsuitas &quot;premature and unwarranted.&quot; Similarly, a letter from Regis McKennaquestioned the timing of this action because construction of a new children'sshelter is planned. While the county has continued to make promises thatrelief from overcrowding is &quot;imminent,&quot; the children in the shelter havecontinued to be subjected to overcrowding expressly prohibited by state law.Thus, the lawsuit to protect the children was long overdue.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  COUNTY OFFICIALS AREN'T ABOVE THE LAW  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Letters to the editor  </MEMO><TEXT>     In March, the county was asked point-blank in a demand letter from thePublic Interest Law Firm to cease the overcrowding of children in thechildren's shelter and to comply with state law requiring occupancy to belimited to 90 children. Deputy County Counsel Deborah Ryan stated in a letterdated March 22, &quot;Additionally, we are not in a position to accede to yourdemand to an agreement not to exceed the occupancy limit of 90 children at theshelter . . . &quot;;    The county is not above the law. Had it acted in the bestinterests of the children and ceased the overcrowding, this lawsuit wouldnever have been filed.;    We applaud the good work Fortin and McKenna aredoing in caring for needy children and working to build a new facility. Butprotecting the statutory rights of children currently in the shelter isequally important. And experience has shown that a court order is often a morecompelling incentive to social change than are appeals for love and charity.;   -- Randolf J.
