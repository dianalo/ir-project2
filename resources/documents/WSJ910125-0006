The Pentagon classifies its exact inventories of suchweapons as Tomahawk missiles and laser-guided &quot;smart&quot; bombs,reasoning that knowing just how many of them the U.S. hascould help Iraq's military efforts. But the question ofweapons shortages has been raised by key members of Congressin closed briefings with Defense Department officials.</LP><TEXT>   So far, the Pentagon has been able to put to rest mostfears that the overall weapons stockpile may be too small.&quot;The question has been raised, and it has been answered to mysatisfaction,&quot; says Republican Sen. John Warner of Virginia,a senior member of both the Armed Services and Intelligencecommittees who has been included in the most secret briefingsCongress has received. &quot;All I can say is that the inventoriesare adequate to meet any reasonable scenarios that would beenvisaged. That is not a concern.&quot;   But worries persist among some important officials aboutsupplies of some specific key systems, including the mostcelebrated weapon of the war's first week: the anti-missileversion of the Patriot missile.   During the Reagan administration's defense buildup of the1980s, the Pentagon ordered more than 5,200 Patriots,according to figures compiled by an independentdefense-research group, the Defense Budget Project. Thoughsome may have been used in other military operations or intraining before the Mideast war, and others haven't beendelivered, there are certainly thousands of Patriots in thePentagon's possession.   The trouble is, most of these Patriots are older versionsdesigned to knock down enemy planes rather than to interceptsuch missiles as the Scuds that Iraq has been firing intoSaudi Arabia and Israel. Officials say well under 1,000 ofthe Patriots are the newer anti-missile versions.   If the war is short, as Pentagon planners still expect,the supply of anti-missile Patriots should be sufficient. Butif the fighting stretches on for many months, some officialsfear the new model may grow scarce.   The issue then becomes how quickly the stockpile can bereplenished. Already, the Pentagon has stepped up orders toRaytheon Co. for more missiles; the company has gone toround-the-clock production in an effort to double output ofthe new Patriots to 100 a month.   The Pentagon denies that shortages of Patriots or otherhigh-tech systems have been a major concern of top warplanners for the battle scenarios they are prosecuting. &quot;Ihaven't heard those concerns expressed in any of the meetingsI've attended, even when the possibility came up of moving inunits from other locations,&quot; says a senior military official.   But an official outside the Pentagon who is familiar withthe inventory situation says simply: &quot;I wish we had morePatriots.&quot;   And retired Gen. Edward C. Meyer, a former Army chief ofstaff who was consulted in the planning stages of the war,says, &quot;I would be concerned if it goes on beyond about 60 to90 days.&quot;   A major reason for the concern, says Gen. Meyer, is thatmany of these weapons have never been used in a major waybefore, so planners aren't really sure how many they need.&quot;There's no background or experience on the utilization of`smart' weapons,&quot; he says. &quot;We know all about things likeartillery shells, but on `smart' bombs there's no experiencethat would give you a comfortable feeling in the pit of yourstomach that we have enough.&quot;   Asked if the troops in the Mideast have any shortages ofammunition or other supplies, Pentagon spokesman PeteWilliams said, &quot;All those numbers are right where they oughtto be.&quot; But he added that &quot;if there were serious shortages .. . we wouldn't be specific about them, because that would bedisclosing to the enemy a vulnerability.&quot;   Officials say war planners at one point set a goal ofhaving enough weaponry on hand in the Mideast to last 60 daysat projected rates. But Gen. Meyer notes that the pace of theair war has been so high that those supplies may run out wellbefore 60 days.   Much depends on the pace of fighting. More than 200Tomahawk cruise missiles were fired in the war's first week.It's estimated by the Defense Budget Project that about 2,400were bought in the 1980s, and fewer may be in the inventory.If the current pace keeps up for a few more months, shortagescould appear.   But the pace may well slow because the Tomahawk, likeother smart weapons, has limited and specialized uses -- forexample, in pinpoint strikes on well-defended targets, likecommand headquarters, that are far more common in the openingstage of war than in later weeks.   Similarly, the Patriots will only need to be fired oftenuntil Iraq runs out of missiles and launchers. That, U.S.officials say, is gradually happening as allied air strikesfind missile-supply buildings and launch sites. If Iraqmanages to mount air strikes on Saudi Arabia and Israel thatget past defending jets, the more plentiful anti-aircraftversions of the Patriot can handle the task.   Pentagon acquisition rates in the Reagan buildup variedwidely. Many things were bought in huge quantities --including most &quot;dumb&quot; ammunition. Even some missiles werebought in the hundreds of thousands, including the anti-tankTOW and rounds for the Multiple Launch Rocket System.   &quot;My expectation is that we won't run out of virtually anyof this stuff for six months,&quot; says Gordon Adams, director ofthe Defense Budget Project. &quot;When you spend as much money asthey did in the 1980s, some of it sticks to the wall.&quot;   ---                       Missile Muscle                                                                                                          Total numbers of various missiles procured by the Pentagonthrough fiscal 1990                                                                                                        Phoenix                      4,213 Laser Hellfire (Army)       35,386 Harm (Navy)                  6,532 IIR Maverick                   868 Patriot                      5,233 Tomahawk                     2,430 Tow (Army)                 213,708                                                                                                          Note: Some missiles may have ben used in previous militarymissions or in training; actual current inventory levels areclassified                                                                                                          Source: Defense Budget Project</TEXT></DOC>
