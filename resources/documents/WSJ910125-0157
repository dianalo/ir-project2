EPRI said it's working with a U.S. utility steeringcommittee to establish standards for advanced light waterreactors. The institute said the AP600 design follows thevision of the utilities for a simpler, more reliable nuclearplant.</LP><TEXT>   The U.S. Department of Energy picked Westinghouse todevelop a simplified, 600-megawatt reactor. That contractcurrently is valued at $119 million. DOE contributed $50million to the project over a six-year period. EPRI,Westinghouse and several Westinghouse associates areproviding the remaining $69 million.   The AP600 is a 600-megawatt pressurized water reactordesign that uses natural physical forces, such as gravity andevaporation, to perform safety functions. The unit isintended to be built in modules in factories, with modules tobe assembled later at the site. That process would shortenthe construction period, permit tighter quality control andimprove the economics of nuclear power plants, Westinghousesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
