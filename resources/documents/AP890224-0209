It doesn't pay to get into a fight with the folks who setinterest rates.   Since taking office, President Bush has been suggesting the Fednot choke off the economic expansion by pushing interest rateshigher.   The president got the Fed's response Friday. And it was just theopposite of what he had hoped to hear.   The central bank raised its discount rate, the fee it charges forloans to commercial banks, to 7 percent, its highest level in threeyears.   A boost in the discount rate is the most dramatic signal theboard can send of its intentions to push a broad range of interestrates higher in an effort to slow an overheated economy.   Three times since Jan. 20, Bush has brushed away worries aboutinflation and said he didn't see the need for the Fed to give theeconomy a dose of tighter credit. Rather, he said, the central bankshould worry more about economic growth because he did not see signsthat inflation was getting out of hand.   Those comments were echoed Thursday by the administration's chiefeconomic spokesman, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, who saidcentral bank policy-makers were anticipating too much. He likenedthe Fed's efforts to combat inflation by raising interest rates toshooting at a duck.   ``When you're aiming at a duck, you can miss it. You can aim toomuch ahead of it or too much behind it,'' Brady said, adding thatthe administration would like the Fed to ``aim a little closer toit.''   Brady did not even try to sugarcoat the message by adding, asBush had, that he did not believe he and the central bank were allthat far apart.   Bush sought to drive that point home again during a newsconference Friday in Tokyo, where he was concluding the first leg ofan Asian tour before heading to China.   Answering reporters questions, Bush acknowledged that he and AlanGreenspan, chairman of the Fed, differ somewhat on the question ofthe threat of a resurgence of inflation.   ``We talked about this,'' Bush said. ``He was more concerned''about the most recent consumer price figures, which showed inflationincreasing at an annual rate of more than 7 percent a year.   ``But I don't think you can make a judgment on one months'figures,'' Bush said. ``But look, if he's right on inflation, hisconcerns, if they're a little more than mine, we should be alert tothat.''   The president went on to say that he and Greenspan have ``got alittle difference of interpretation, now, as to how you read theindicators on inflation.'' But Bush said ``that's the onlydifference we've got.''   Bush said he did not like to see interest rates rising, and saidthat ``this argues even more forcefully than I've been able to arguethat we need to be able to get an agreement'' with Congress on a newfiscal 1990 budget that meets deficit-reduction targets.   While disputes between the central bank and a president are notuncommon, some members of Congress were taken aback by Brady'sapparent disregard for the threat of inflation, especially given thebarrage of bad news on the price front in recent weeks.   Labor costs, wholesale prices and consumer prices have all beenheaded higher. The government reported Wednesday that retail pricesshot up at their fastest pace in two years last month, an annualrate of 7.2 percent, almost double the 4.4 percent increase recordedin 1988.   ``I'm disappointed that the administration is not more seriousabout this problem,'' Rep. Stephen Neal, D-N.C., lectured Bradyduring his appearance before the House Banking Committee.   What concerns many observers is that the Fed may be forced toboost interest rates higher and more quickly than it had intended todispell doubts in financial markets about the central bank's resolveto fight inflation because of the administration's verbal sniping.   Greenspan, a longtime Republican strategist and close friend ofBush, has gone out of his way to emphasize the central bank'spolitical independence even though he and the other six boardmembers were all appointed by former President Reagan.   Recognizing the dangers of a public dispute with the Fed, Bushbudget director Richard Darman took the unusual step on Friday oftelling his colleagues in the administration to cool it.   He said disputes between an administration and the Fed were``extremely unhelpful'' adding, ``It tends to be unsettling to the(financial) markets, unsettling to foreigners and confusing topeople who are trying to plan and none of those things is good forthe economy.''   Darman's unspoken fear is that foreigners, who finance anincreasing share of America's borrowing needs, might suddenly decideto dump their dollar-denominated assets because of fears that theFed had responded to political pressure and abandoned itsinflation-fighting campaign.   Many economists believe such a ``dollar strike'' is the mostlikely way the next recession will be triggered. Fears about theintentions of foreign investors helped trigger Black Monday, the508-point drop in the stock market of October 1987.   With the increase in the discount rate, the central bank hopes todemonstrate its resolve and keep the economy headed toward a softlanding, the process whereby gradual increases in interest rates areenough over time to slow economic demand and thus relieveinflationary pressures.   Many economists believe the process will work. They note that theFed's credit tightening has already boosted short-term interestrates by around 3 percentage points since March, when the tighteningbegan. They predict overall growth should begin slowingsignificantly by this spring.   If the Fed is successful, the economic recovery, already at apeacetime record of six years, will keep steaming ahead.   But if inflation keeps rising and the Fed is forced to clamp downeven tighter, then Bush's worst fears of a recession could cometrue.</TEXT><HEAD>___</HEAD><TEXT>   EDITOR'S NOTE: Martin Crutsinger has covered economics for TheAssociated Press since 1984.</TEXT></DOC>
