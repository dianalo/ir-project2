The new design features application of slopedmultichannel elements and permeable inserts. A prototype of the thickenerwas tested at the Mikhailovskaya coal preparation plant (Voroshilovgradugleobogashchenie).Specifications of the thickener are given: diameter 2.36 m, height 5.2m. For flotation tailings thickened to 400-500 g/l partial loads on thethickener were 7-8 and 0.4-0.6 t/(m{sup 2}xh). Performance tests showedthat thickeners with permeable inserts permit higher loads and greatereffectiveness to be achieved than with those used until now (e.g. S10and S10-1). Technical documentation of a series of thickeners with permeableinserts with diameters of 2.5, 3.5 and 4.5 m has been eleborated. Thenew design is recommended for achieving recirculated water containing50-80 g solids per l.</TEXT></DOC>
