<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-22-0312 </DOCNO><TEXT>We are designing a whole body Positron Emission Tomography (PET) machinebased on a new type of large area sodium iodide (NaI) detector. As pointedout in earlier publications, a tomograph based on these new detectorscan have several advantages over conventional PET machines, which arebased on small Bismuth Germanate (BGO) detectors. Monte Carlo computersimulations have been used to compare some of the performance parametersof a tomograph based on the new detectors to similar parameters of conventionalsmall crystal machines. Three different variants of prototype detectorshave been constructed and many tests performed, including measurementsof transverse spatial resolution, depth-of-interaction resolution, energyresolution, time resolution, and high counting-rate capabilities. 7 refs.,10 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
