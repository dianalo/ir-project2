Ltd. on Thursdayunveiled a station wagon version of its mid-sized Accord sedan, thenation's best-selling car.   The 1991 Accord Wagon, designed and engineered in the UnitedStates, is the first mid-sized station wagon in the Honda line. Itbegan rolling off assembly lines Nov. 20 at the company'sMarysville plant, officials said at a briefing to introduce thecar.   Although pointed primarily at the North American market, Hondaexpects to export about 10,000 during the first production year,said Thomas G. Elliott, executive vice president for automobilesales.   Elliott said he expects about 35,000 wagons to be sold in thefirst year. He said between 4,000 and 5,000 will be marketed inEurope and the rest in Japan and other Far East markets.   Honda said the wagon is the first U.S.-made car the company willexport to Europe. It joins the Accord line of four-door sedans andtwo-door coupes, also made at Marysville, about 35 miles northwestof Columbus. Honda exports the Accord coupe to Asia.   The Accord was the top-selling car in the United States lastyear and is expected to be again this year when final numbers aretallied. By adding a station wagon, the model could widen itsalready substantial lead over the No. 2 seller, Ford Motor Co.'sTaurus, which includes a station wagon version.   Kurt Antonius, manager of public relations for Honda of America,said the nation's station wagon sales declined sharply with theintroduction of the minivan in the mid-1980s, but is enjoying aresurgence. He said the Honda wagon is expected to be a sport andfamily vehicle.   The wagon was designed at Honda's Torrance, Calif., facility andengineered and tested at its central Ohio plant.   Antonius said Honda's total sales through November were up 15percent over 1989 and the Accord sedans and coupes will have 58percent of the Honda market in 1990. Total Accord sales for 1990are expected to be about 410,000 units, up from 380,000 in 1989.   Elliott said the addition of the station wagon at Marysvillewill not increase total production at the plant. Assembly of theCivic is being shifted to Honda's new plant in East Liberty, lessthan 10 miles away, and assembly of the station wagon will be mixedwith that of Accord's four-door and two-door coupe models.   It will be available in two models - the 125-horsepower LX andthe 140-horsepower EX - both with a standard five-speedtransmission or the optional four-speed automatic. Both have2.2-liter, four-cylinder engines.   Depending on the model, the wagon will cost $17,300 to $19,800.It also was expected to get 20 or 22 miles per gallon in citydriving and 26 or 27 miles a gallon on the highway, also dependingon the model.   Base prices for the Honda wagon are higher than those of theTaurus, which range from $15,629 to $19,128. The Honda is slightlylonger and narrower than the Taurus, but has a longer wheelbase.   The announcement of the new car came as the nation'sfourth-largest automaker reported U.S. sales for the year running15 percent ahead of last year. It said 676,981 Honda automobileswere sold through November, compared with 589,090 at the same timein 1989.   Honda, the first Japanese automaker to build cars in the UnitedStates, employs more than 9,000 people at four auto, motorcycle andengine plants in Ohio.   Honda began manufacturing in the United States in September 1979with production at its motorcycle plant in Marysville.   The auto plant at Marysville began production of the Accord inNovember 1982, and an engine plant in Anna, in western Ohio, beganproduction in July 1985.   The Civic four-door sedan was added to production at Marysvillein July 1986. Production of the engine for the Civic began at Annathe same year.   The company added an auto assembly plant near its Marysvilleoperation last year. The new plant, called the East Liberty AutoPlant, makes Civic four-door sedans.</TEXT></DOC>
