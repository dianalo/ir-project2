Me?;   Well, maybe a little.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  SAVE SARCASM FOR THOSE WHO KNOW HOW TO SLING IT  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Recchi is a columnist for the Fort Lauderdale News andamp; Sun-Sentinel.  </MEMO><TEXT>     But the way I see it, sarcasm can be an efficient method of communication.A sarcastic answer to a stupid question serves two purposes -- imparting theinformation requested as well as emphasizing the stupidity of the question.;  One evening when my son Joe was in high school, for example, he returned froma trip to the mall and walked into the kitchen, where the rest of the familywas sitting around the table, clearly in the process of consuming food.;  Well, it was clear to me, anyway. In the center of the table was a plate ofburritos, a bowl of cole slaw and a bowl of rice. People were chatting andchewing.;   &quot;Did you guys have dinner yet?&quot; Joey asked.;   &quot;No, son,&quot; I said,putting down my fork. &quot;We decided to postpone dinner until after we eat.&quot;;  Sure, sarcasm can be nasty, embarrassing the individual on the receiving endof it. For that reason, and probably several others, most experts inchild-rearing advise against it.;   But cruel though it may be at times, itcan serve a noble purpose by raising the level of conversation within aparticular group above and beyond the obvious.;   If someone doesn't like theidea of being the object of a sarcastic remark, that is, he is less likely toask a stupid question or make an obvious observation.;   Besides, as in myson's case, sarcasm is not the cause of the embarrassment but usually just away of accentuating the embarrassment a person brings upon himself.;   Where Itend to agree with the critics is when sarcasm is used for its own sake, forno purpose other than to elicit a laugh by embarrassing someone who doesn'tdeserve it.;   In a bar one afternoon, for example, a couple of friends and Iwere watching the New York Yankees play the Boston Red Sox on TV when astranger approached me and asked, &quot;What game is this?&quot;;   &quot;Baseball,&quot; I said.&quot;Where have you been?&quot;;   It was not only unfair, but dangerous. Had he beenthe kind of person who resents sarcasm, he might have asked if I wanted toforget baseball and try my hand at boxing.;   But I can't help it. I'm a bornsarcastic. Although some people regard it as learned behavior, I think sarcasmis in the genes -- like hair color or a tendency toward alcoholism.;   Infact, it recently came to my attention that there is an organization calledSarcastics Anonymous. Members call themselves &quot;recovering sarcastics&quot; butmaintain that &quot;no true sarcastic is ever completely recovered.&quot;;   To makeAmerica aware of their plight, the group has declared October to be NationalSarcastics Awareness Month.;   Although I can identify with them, I'm notlooking for any sympathy. I enjoy being sarcastic. I am from a long line ofsarcastics. My wife inherited a mild sarcastic streak from her mother.Naturally, we have produced three mega-sarcastic kids.;   Sure, that can leadto a few arguments and hard feelings. But it also brings us together by givingus something in common. We all enjoy Marx Brothers movies, for example. We allare fans of Tom Lehrer, David Letterman and &quot;Saturday Night Live.&quot;;   What'smore, as devotees of such communication, we often congratulate one another onparticularly witty sarcastic remarks.;   Of course, we try to hold it in checkaround those who don't appreciate -- or understand -- sarcasm. For one thing,it would be wasted. Also, it tends to alienate such people.;   If I'm not surewhether someone falls into that category, I use the Letterman Test. People whodon't appreciate sarcasm are the ones who ask, &quot;What's funny about DavidLetterman?&quot;;   (The correct answer, by the way, is: &quot;His ears. What else?&quot;)  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Ray Recchi column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911014  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  October  </MONTH><PG.COL>  5C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  638  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday, October 14, 199100288031,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
