In preliminary rulings, the commission concluded that the Commerce Department should continue its investigation of complaints about the imports filed by the Copper and Brass Fabricators Council on behalf of U.S. producers.    Commission officials said imports of brass sheet and strip from Japan last year totaled about $22.1 million, while imports from the Netherlands amounted to about $16 million.    If the Commerce Department and the ITC later issue final rulings against the imports, anti-dumping act duties may be imposed. In general the penalty duties are imposed if the Commerce Department finds foreign-made products are sold to U.S. buyers at less than the cost of production or below the &quot;home-market&quot; price for the same articles. </TEXT></DOC>
