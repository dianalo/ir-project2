The market value of 45 large biotech stocks nearly doubledin the two months through October -- to $45 billion, saysJohn Kaweske of Denver's Financial Funds. Yet a recentdownturn in the group accelerated yesterday, promptingwidespread worries that others may soon fall out of bed.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;You've seen a group that's had an incredible run, andit's naturally going to correct,&quot; says Michael Gordon,manager of the $1 billion Fidelity Select Biotechnology Fund.   &quot;There's been indiscriminate buying&quot; and investors shouldbe wary even though biotech stocks aren't bracing for awholesale fall, says Anne K. Anderson, president of AtlantisInvestment Co., a growth-stock research concern.   No one is calling biotech a bad business. The federalgovernment estimates that sales of genetically engineereddrugs will explode to $50 billion by the year 2000, from $2billion this year. But many of this year's start-ups won't bearound five years from now, market veterans say. Meanwhile,the speculative fever has caught up nearly every company inthe group.   &quot;You've got some really high speculative fever in thebiotech sector,&quot; says Mark Simon, an analyst with SanFrancisco-based Robertson Stephens andamp; Co. &quot;A lot of retailinvestors don't want to miss the train that's pulling out ofthe station.&quot; A PaineWebber Inc. index of 103 biotech stockssoared 128% in the year's first 10 months.   Rushing into the arms of eager investors this year havebeen 32 young biotechnology companies making initial publicofferings -- more than the total for the prior three years.Including stock sales by already public companies, thebiotech crowd has raised $2.3 billion -- nearly one-third ofthe $7.4 billion raised for the whole biotech industry since1980, according to IDD Information Services. And the heat isstill on: Nearly two dozen more companies plan offeringsbefore New Year's Day.   But investors' ardor seems to be cooling for some of thecompanies. Take Anergen, a company working on a treatment formultiple sclerosis and other diseases. No sooner did theRedwood City, Calif., company go public last month at $8 ashare than the stock nearly quadrupled, hitting $31.50 withintwo weeks. Then investors began pondering the fact thatAnergen isn't planning to apply to the Food and DrugAdministration to begin clinical tests on a product beforelate next year. Even if the application is approved and thetests succeed, Anergen is years away from selling a product.By yesterday, the shares had descended from the stratosphereto $16, down 75 cents, in late over-the-counter trading.   Many times in the past, a blizzard of new offerings hasbeen followed by a rainy season for stock prices. A recent T.Rowe Price Associates study showed that stock performance ofbiotech issues declined sharply in the second quarters of1983, 1986 and 1987, all times when public financings ofbiotech issues reached record levels.   Investors who chase biotech today often pay steeplymarked-up prices. Immunex Corp. was quoted at $54.75, down$2, yesterday in late OTC trading, but up 36% from threeweeks earlier. The company hasn't announced any new productsor made any major discoveries in that period.   With this week's cooling of biotech stocks, professionalinvestors say the great 1991 rally in biotech stocks appearsfinally to be losing steam. &quot;I think this is the end of thebeginning -- we get to a rest for awhile,&quot; says BarbaraHoffman of Denver's Financial Funds.   Some biotech stocks may still thrive. Mr. Gordon says thateven if the stocks as a group head lower, he still believesthat the best biotech stocks will continue to outperform themarket.   Yet the biotech winners may get harder to find. Becausethere are so many new biotech offerings, Wall Street analystsare unable to do research on most of them. Oppenheimer andamp; Co.has just added a fourth stock analyst to its biotech researchteam, &quot;and we still can't follow many of the new biotechissues,&quot; says Jeffrey Casdin, who heads Oppenheimer's team.   &quot;Wall Street research has ground to a halt,&quot; says Mr.Simon at Robertson Stephens. &quot;If it's bad for us, think howbad it is for investors.&quot; He adds: &quot;I'm getting calls fromrelatives {with maturing CDs} who would never even buy IBMbecause it's too risky. With low money-market yields and withreal-estate prospects hardly robust, they're willing to buythe riskiest stocks in the market. It just blows my mind.&quot;   Even savvy investors such as Fidelity's Mr. Gordon havebeen buffeted at times by biotech stocks. His fund ownsImmune Response, which has lost more than one third of itsmarket value this week amid concern that federal regulatorswill require lengthy testing of its AIDS vaccine. Mr. Gordonis believed to have sold off much of the fund's Immunexposition three months ago, only to buy Immunex shares backlater at a higher price. Mr. Gordon says only that &quot;we arevery large shareholders of Immunex&quot;; he allows that thefund's position is &quot;higher now than it was two months ago.&quot;   Traders say the group is even more volatile than usual.With some professional traders storming in to buy or sell forquick trading profits, &quot;all these stocks are very fragileright now,&quot; says biotech stock trader Amy Foster of Kidder,Peabody andamp; Co.   Yet biotech remains one of the few stock-market sectorswhere getting in on the ground floor can make an investorrich. Hence, seasoned investors are scouring foropportunities, lured by the industry's potential to fightsuch elusive ailments as Alzheimer's, cancer and AIDS, and tofind better ways to grow crops, control pests and clean uppollution.   Ms. Hoffman, for example, has been watching Synergen as ittumbled 12% this week. By 1995, she expects the company tohave more than $500 million in annual sales of drugs to treatseptic shock and other inflammatory diseases such asrheumatoid arthritis and asthma. At yesterday's close of$57.25, Synergen is still a little pricey, she says, but at$45 a share, it would be attractive again.   Mr. Casdin is more dour. &quot;If the market cracks, biotechwill crack, too,&quot; he says. But if an economic recovery setsin, and other sectors perform better, &quot;a lot of the hot moneywill leave and crater biotech stocks. Things don't look greateither way.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
