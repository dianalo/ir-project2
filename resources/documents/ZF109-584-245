 One company that is taking itselfin hand is Sherwood Computers Plc.andP;  Sherwood is 20 years old and during thattime has grown from a bureau service remote from customers into a softwareand services company where frequent customer contact is part of the sale.andO;Last year Sherwood was arranged in six business units catering for threehorizontal markets and three vertical markets.andP;  On January 1 1991 Sherwoodwill comprise 26 business teams and a board of directors.andP;  In between, aminor revolution has been taking place.andP;  Earlier in the year the board satfor several days and came up with a plan to cut bureaucracy within thecompany.andP;  The solution was &quot;teamworking&quot;.andP;  The teams were to beself-sufficient business units and the change in structure would eliminatefour or five layers of management without any job losses.andP;  A huge andexpensive re-education project got under way immediately.andP;  Employees' ideasabout career structures had to be altered beyond recognition.andP;  For example,systems analysts have come to believe that their future prospects lie with amanagement job rather than with their true job skills as an analyst.andO;Sherwood's director of group sales, Barney Quinn, explains that one of themain reasons for moving to teamworking was to enable people to go back towhat they are good at.andP;  Merit awards will in future go to reward people forinnovation within their particular technical or sales area, not forscrambling up the traditional corporate ladder.andP;  An appraisal system has beenset up but the principle is management by team-agreed objectives.andP;  Some ofthe teams are self-led, that is different leaders are expected to come to thefore for particular projects, while other teams will elect a leader atregular intervals.andP;  The number of team members varies but on the whole eachteam is considered to have a full complement of staff with between 15 and 20people.andP;  A lot of the teams have been determined by the geographical locationof offices, others have come together around a particular service or product.andO;For each market sector in which Sherwood operates there are marketco-ordinating teams on which representatives from each of the relevant teamssit.andP;  Above this there is a business team made up of directors of the holdingcompany and the boards of other member companies.andP;  Moving between thesedifferent teams are advisors, who have specialist skills and act as internalconsultants.andP;  Creating the right cultural environment has not been easy, asQuinn says, he has had to go into the company and actively sell the idea.andO;The Ashridge Management College has also been brought in to help with partsof the change.andM;Doubting ThomasesandM;A number of teams have been created internally to help develop theteamworking idea but there are still a number of doubting Thomases andSherwood has lost a few employees over the strategy.andP;  However, Sherwood has,historically, had a problem identifying high fliers and Quinn hopes thatteamworking will remedy this.andP;  One slight problem Quinn does foresee withteamworking is having difficulties recruiting people in the middle of theirchosen career, who might well miss the security of a traditional corporatestructure.andP;  Nevertheless, clients have been supportive of the new teamworkingstrategy because many are trying to bring in similar internal changes.andO;Clients are encourged to sit in on team meetings and become part of the teamwith which they are dealing.andP;  Unfortunately, most companies in theinformation technology sector that are looking to institute changes such asSherwood has done have their backs against the wall as they face decliningprofits or even losses.andP;  Quinn does not believe that such sweeping corporatechanges can be implemented in these circumstances for two reasons: employeesneed to have high morale to accept the changes, and the changes themselvescost a lot to implement.andP;  Sherwood was in the fortunate position that it hadmade job cuts in 1988, got its base strategy together, and was looking for away to fuel growth.andP;  Time will tell whether teamworking is the dynamo it waslooking for.andP;
