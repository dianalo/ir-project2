The detector energy resolution of {similar_to}0.08/{radical}E (E is measured in gigaelectronvolts), the accuracy ofreconstructing coordinates of {gamma}-quanta and electrons (positrons)of {similar_to} 10 mm, the level of discrimination of signals from hadronsof {similar_to} 2x10/sup -3/ are measured under irradiation in beamsof positrons and {pi}/sup +/-mesons with 3 and 5 GeV energies.</TEXT></DOC>
