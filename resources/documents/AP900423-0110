TATRO</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Israeli officials on Monday welcomed therelease of a U.S. hostage in Lebanon but gave no indication thatIsrael would comply with Iranian demands that Israel free akidnapped Lebanese Shiite clergyman.   Sources close to the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army saidmilitia chief Antoine Lahad would decide on Tuesday whether to freesome of his 300 prisoners for Id Al Fitr, the Moslem holidaymarking the end of the Ramadan fast.   Pro-Iranian radicals holding 17 Western hostages and threeIsraeli soldiers in Lebanon could interpret the release of themostly Shiite Moslem inmates from the Al Khiam prison just north ofIsrael's border as a goodwill gesture.   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there wasa tradition of freeing prisoners during the holiday. But they saidany release would be up to Lahad and unconnected with the issue ofWestern hostages.   Earlier in the day, Israel radio quoted the South Lebanon Armyas saying it had no intention of freeing Shiite prisoners inresponse to the release of the American hostage.   Iran called for goodwill gestures and a reciprocal move afterU.S. hostage Robert Polhill, 55, an educator held for 1,182 days,was set free Sunday.   Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati of Iran demanded the releaseof Shiite Moslem cleric Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, who was abductedby Israeli troops in Lebanon in July.   The Tehran Times, an English-language daily close to PresidentHashemi Rafsanjani, noted Israel's detention of scores of Arabprisoners impeded efforts to free Western hostages. Israeli armyspokesmen and other officials gave no indication that Israelplanned to free Obeid.   Avi Pazner, spokesman for caretaker Prime Minister YitzhakShamir, welcomed the freeing of the American hostage and saidIsrael was making efforts to free its own soldiers held captive inLebanon.   ``We are very pleased to hear about the release of this(American) hostage and would like to see the day when all hostages,Americans, others and especially Israelis, are also released. Wepray that that day will come soon,'' Pazner said in an interview.   He acknowledged that Israel and the United States discussed thehostage issue but said: ``There was no coordination on the releaseof this hostage.''   Israel has offered to trade Obeid for all foreign hostages,including an Israeli air force navigator and two soldiers who werecaptured by Shiite guerrillas in Lebanon in 1986.   An Israeli army spokesman declined to say if Israel wouldrelease any of the nearly 9,000 Palestinians jailed in connectionwith the 28-month-old Palestinian uprising.   In the days before Polhill's release, Israel carried out twoattacks in Lebanon that were seen by some observers as increasedpressure on pro-Iranian groups holding hostages.</TEXT></DOC>
