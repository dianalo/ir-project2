RobertsStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 07/29/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> SBCTELECOMMUNICATIONS, BROADCASTING, TELEPHONE, TELEGRAPH (TEL) </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Southwestern Bell Corp., despite a laggard regional economy, expects to produce &quot;competitive earnings&quot; in 1987, said Zane E. Barnes, chairman and chief executive officer.    Addressing securities analysts here, Mr. Barnes and other top executives of the St. Louis-based regional Bell holding company didn't offer a specific full-year earnings projection. However, one executive said privately that results probably would be in line with the average 2.7% gain in net income expected by Wall Street analysts. That would indicate full-year profit of about $1.05 billion.    In 1986, the company's net rose 2.7% to $1.02 billion, or $10.26 a share, on almost flat revenue of $7.9 billion.    The executives said the company expects to offset the impact of the sluggish economy and to post slight earnings gains through continued work-force reductions, cuts in capital spending and other cost-control measures.    The executives sketched an optimistic view of Southwestern's cellular telephone operations. They forecast revenue gains of as much as 40% next year, 25% in 1989 and 15% annually thereafter. With an expected 50% increase to 120,000 cellular customers by year's end, the operations -- one of the company's long-term strategic thrusts -- are rapidly expanding.    Those expectations for cellular further confirm what Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp.'s Dennis H. Leibowitz describes as the &quot;most explosive new market in the communications industry.&quot; Customer growth is surging for the entire industry, along with the value of cellular properties.    Nonetheless, Southwestern Bell's optimism is tempered by the fact that the company has yet to receive federal Judge Harold Greene's approval of its proposed $1.3 billion acquisition of Secaucus, N.J.-based Metromedia Co.'s cellular and paging operations. Judge Greene helps enforce the decree that broke up of the Bell System and must approve acquisitions by the seven so-called Baby Bells. Southwestern Bell's cellular projections reflect performance of its own cellular operations and Metromedia's. Mr. Barnes expressed the hope that Judge Greene will decide within the next two or three weeks.    For now, the largest impact on earnings is the poorly performing Southwestern economy. Last year, it was the &quot;worst regional economy (in the Southwest) in a quarter of a century,&quot; though projections call for the overall regional business volume to inch up 0.4% this year, the executives said. That is in contrast to a 2.2% projected increase in the gross national product cited by the officials.    John E. Hayes Jr., president of the company's flagship telephone company unit, outlined expense controls that include a work-force reduction totaling 3,000 employees this year and a lowering of capital spending by $500 million from a year earlier. The unit's capital spending cut will reduce the parent's capital spending about 38% to $1.4 billion, the company said. Maintenance costs will decline about 10% from last year.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Southwestern shares closed at $36.625, up 37.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
