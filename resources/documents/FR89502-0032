For example, it is impractical for an examiner, searchinga particularly lengthy sequence in a non-conforming format, to accuratelykey the query necessary to search the sequence in a computerized search.Further, the lack of standardized symbol use and standardized format resultsin a very difficult comparison, on the part of the examiner and the public,of what is claimed in a given patent application and what is disclosedin the prior art. Still further, the number of patent applications containingnucleotide and amino acid sequences is increasing every year. The majorexamination problems can be attributed to the volume of data and the useof inconsistent paper formats. The lack of consistency in symbols usedand formatting requires examiners to attempt to convert the sequence data,as it appears in patent applications, into formats that are consistentwith those appearing in the prior art in order to make proper evaluationsof the patentability of the inventions claimed in the patent applications.Problems are also encountered in the printing of nucleotide and amino acidsequence data in patents because the data must be rekeyed under currentpatent printing procedures. This easily results in the printing of erroneoussequences. In summary, the diversity and complexity of nucleotide and aminoacid sequence data result in searching and analysis difficulties both withinthe PTO and outside the PTO, decreased accuracy of search and reproductionand increased cost.The PTO proposes to amend its regulations to establish a standardized formatfor descriptions of nucleotide and amino acid sequence data submitted asa part of patent applications, in conjunction with the required submissionof the data in computer readable form, which would result in the followingadvantages:1. Cost savings in input of sequence data;2. A practical and more accurate sequence search capability;3. Improved interference detection;4. More efficient examination;5. Improved accuracy of printed sequences;6. Creation of a PTO data base of most patent-disclosed sequence data;7. Improved public data access and dissemination in electronic form;8. Exchange of published sequence data, in electronic form, with the JapanesePatent Office (JPO) and the European Patent Office (EPO) in a TrilateralSequence Exchange Project;9. Conformity with the scientific community; and10. The encouragement of private vendors to include sequences appearingin patents in their data bases.With regard to interference detection, no distinction is made in the rulesthat follow between sequences that are claimed versus those that are disclosedbut not claimed. Such a distinction may prove to be beneficial in the determinationof interferences. However, problems may arise due to the amendment of anapplication whereby that which is claimed versus that which is disclosedbut not claimed may vary until issuance. Comments are requested on theadvantages and disadvantages of distinguishing between claimed and disclosedsequences, and, whether a distinction should be made.In those areas of biotechnology in which nucleotide and/or amino acid sequenceinformation is significant, many patent applicants are accustomed to orfamiliar with the submission of such sequence information to various sequencedata bases, such as GenBank which is operated and maintained by the NationalInstitutes of Health. In order to facilitate such submissions or merelyfor the purpose of researching and developing sequence information, manyeventual patent applicants also generate or encode sequence informationin computer readable form. In view of this, the format proposed hereinis based on the GenBank data format and forms currently in use. Submissionof sequence data using the current GenBank format and forms is generallyacceptable, except where there are differences between the GenBank formatand forms and the rules herein. In those instances where differences doarise, e.g., with regard to specific patent application and computer readableform information, the rules that follow control the format of the sequencesubmission. To facilitate compliance with the rules that follow, the PTOmay make available to the public input programs that are modeled afterthe GenBank Author-In program and are further specifically tailored tothe requirements herein and the PTO may also offer a course for applicantsand/or their attorneys to aid in their compliance with these rules, ifthere is sufficient indication of need for such programs and/or courses.The proposed standard symbols and format, as well as the submission ofsequence data in computer readable form, would be required for all disclosuresof nucleotide and amino acid sequence data in patent applications filedafter the effective date of the rule change. It is currently envisionedthat January 1, 1990 will be the effective date of the final rule change.It is also envisioned that, for the great majority of applications affectedby this rule change, applicants will not be subjected to significant additionalburdens, with regard to both time and/or costs, in order to comply withthese proposed rules. However, if exceptional circumstances do arise andcertain applicants experience specific hardships in attempting to complywith these rules, the PTO will consider appropriate non-fee petitions towaive the rules. The proposed rule change will not apply to reissue orreexamination applications filed after the effective date unless the applicationwhich matured into the patent sought to be reissued or reexamined was subjectto these rules.  The proposed rules are part of an ongoing coordinated effort in the privatesector and among the EPO, the JPO and the PTO to standardize the use ofsymbols and the format for sequence information, in order to permit theexchange and use of each other's data. The proposed rules define a setof symbols and procedures that will be both mandatory and the only waythat an applicant will be permitted to describe information about a sequencethat falls within the definitions used in the proposed rules. Thus, proposedandSection; 1.821 defines a sequence for the purpose of these proposed rules,the requirements for specific symbols, formats, paper and computer readablecopies of the sequence, and the deadlines for complying with the requirements.Proposed andSection;andSection; 1.822 to 1.824 set forth detailed descriptionsof the requirements that are proposed to be mandatory for the presentationof sequence data, and proposed andSection; 1.825 sets forth procedures thatwould be available to an applicant in the event that amendments to thesequence information or replacement of the computer readable copy becamenecessary. There is nothing in these proposed rules that is intended toalter in any manner the prohibition against the introduction of new matter(35 U.S.C. 132 and 251), or the prohibition against the introduction ofinformation that is not described in the application as originally filed(35 U.S.C. 112, first paragraph).  With general regard to the symbols and format to be used for nucleotideand/or amino acid sequence data set forth in proposed andSection; 1.822 andthe form and format for sequence submissions in computer readable formset forth in proposed andSection; 1.824, the PTO intends to accommodate progressin the areas of both standardization and computerization as they relateto sequence data by subsequently amending the rules to take into accountany such progress. This progress will probably be reflected in a liberalizationof the proposed rules. For example, the computer readable form is currentlybeing limited to diskettes and tapes, but it can readily be seen that progressin the technology for developing databases of the type the PTO has envisionedwill likely permit a broadening of the permissible types of computer readableforms that may be submitted. The same can be said for the computer/operating-systemconfigurations that are currently permitted. As the PTO becomes able toprovide greater liberality in these areas, the PTO will do so by the publicationof appropriate notices in the ``Official Gazette.'' Further, the PTO willperiodically update the final rules to reflect the ``Official Gazette''notices published in the interim.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Specific Rules  </ITAG>Section 1.821(a), if added as proposed, would present a definition for``nucleotide and/or amino acid sequences.'' This definition sets forthlimits, in terms of numbers of amino acids and/or numbers of nucleotides,at or above which, compliance with the rules that follow is required. Thelimit of four or more amino acids has been established herein for consistencywith limits in place for industry database collections whereas the limitof ten or more nucleotides, while lower than certain industry databaselimits, has been established to encompass those nucleotide sequences towhich the smallest probe will bind in a stable manner. Specifically, theamino acid limit is consistent with the limits in place in industry databasecollections, such as the National Biomedical Research Foundation ProteinIdentification Resource (NBRF-PIR; Washington, DC) database and the InternationalProtein Information Database in Japan (JIPID; Tokyo). The limits for aminoacids and nucleotides are also consistent with those established for sequencedata exchange with the JPO and the EPO.  Sections 1.821(a)(1) and 1.821(a)(2), if added as proposed, would presentfurther definitions for those nucleotide and amino acid sequences thatare intended to be embraced by the rules that follow. Nucleotide sequencesare further limited to those that can be represented by the symbols setforth in proposed andSection; 1.822(b)(1). Amino acid sequences are furtherlimited to those listed in proposed andSection; 1.822(b)(2) and those L-aminoacids that are commonly found in naturally occurring proteins. The limitationto L-amino acids is based upon the fact that there currently exists nowidely accepted standard nomenclature for representing the scope of aminoacids encompassed by non-L-amino acids, and, as such, the process of meaningfullyencoding these other amino acids for computerized searching and printingis not currently feasible.  Section 1.821(b), if added as proposed, would require exclusive conformance,with regard to the manner in which the nucleotide and/or amino acid sequencesare presented and described, with the rules that follow for all applicationsthat include nucleotide and amino acid sequences that fall within the abovedefinitions. This requirement is necessary to minimize any confusion thatcould result if more than one format for representing sequence data wasemployed in a given application. It is also expected that the preferredstandard format will be more readily and widely accepted and adopted ifits use is exclusive, as well as mandatory.  Section 1.821(c), if added as proposed, would require that applications,containing nucleotide and/or amino acid sequences that fall within theabove definitions, contain, as a separate part of the disclosure on papercopy, a disclosure of the nucleotide and/or amino acid sequences, and associatedinformation, using the format and symbols that are set forth in proposedandSection;andSection; 1.822 and 1.823. This separate part of the disclosureon paper copy will be referred to as the ``Sequence Listing'' and requiresthat each sequence disclosed in the application appear separately in the``Sequence Listing,'' with each sequence further being assigned a sequenceidentification number, referred to as ``SEQ ID NO.'' A plurality of sequencesmay, if feasible, be presented on a single page and this may be extendedto the separate presentation of both nucleotide and amino acid sequenceson the same page. The requirement for sequence identification numbers,at a minimum, requires that each sequence be assigned a different numberfor purposes of identification. However, where practical and for ease ofreference, sequences should be presented in the separate part of the applicationin numerical order.  Section 1.821(d), if added as proposed, would require the use of the assignedsequence identifier in all instances where the description or claims ofa patent application discuss sequences regardless of whether a given sequenceis also embedded in the text of the description or claims of an application.This requirement is also intended to permit references, in both the descriptionand claims, to sequences set forth in the ``Sequence Listing'' by the useof assigned sequence identifiers without repeating the sequence in thetext of the description or claims.  Section 1.821(e), if added as proposed, would require the submission ofa copy of the ``Sequence Listing'' in computer readable form. The computerreadable form will be used by the PTO to establish a database for searchingand printing nucleotide and amino acid sequences. This electronic databasewill also enable the PTO to exchange patented sequence data, in electronicform, with JPO and the EPO. It should be noted that the PTO's databasewill comply with the confidentiality requirement imposed by 35 U.S.C. 122.That is, the PTO will not exchange or make public any information on anysequence until the patent application containing that information maturesinto a patent.       The second sentence of proposed andSection; 1.821(e) indicates that, as betweenthe paper copy of the ``Sequence Listing'' and the computer readable copythereof, the paper copy would serve as the official copy. However, thePTO would like to permit correction of the paper copy, at the least, duringthe pendency of a given application by reference to the computer readablecopy thereof if both the paper and computer readable forms were submittedat the time of filing of the application. In this regard, the PTO willassume that the computer readable form has been incorporated by referenceinto the application, when the paper and computer readable forms were submittedat the time of filing of the application. The PTO will attempt to accommodateor address all correction issues but it must be kept in mind that the realburden rests with the applicant to ensure that discrepancies between thepaper copy and the computer readable form are minimized and applicantsshould be aware that there will be instances where the applicant may haveto suffer any consequences of discrepancies between the two. All correctionswould be made by appropriate fee-paid petitions. The paper copy would alsoserve as the official copy for priority purposes. Comments specificallyaddressing this issue are encouraged, with the caveat that the PTO doesnot desire to be bound by a requirement to permanently preserve computerreadable forms for support, priority or correction purposes. For example,the PTO will make corrections, where appropriate, by reference to the computerreadable form as long as the computer readable form is still availableto the PTO. However, once use to the PTO for processing has ended, i.e.,once the PTO has entered the data contained on the computer readable forminto the appropriate database, the PTO does not currently intend to furtherpreserve the computer readable form, submitted by applicant.Section 1.821(f), if added as proposed, would require that the paper andcomputer readable copies of the ``Sequence Listing'' be accompanied bya statement that the content of the paper and computer readable copiesare the same, at the time when the computer readable form is submitted.This statement must be a verified statement if it is made by a person notregistered to practice before the PTO. Such a statement may be made bythe applicant.Section 1.821(g), if added as proposed, would require compliance with therequirements of paragraphs (b) through (f), as discussed above, withintwo months from the date of filing under 35 U.S.C. 111 or within two monthsfrom the date of entering the national stage of an international applicationunder 35 U.S.C. 371 or one month from the date of a notice requiring compliance,whichever is later, if the above noted requirements are not satisfied atthe time of filing. Failure to comply will result in the abandonment ofthe application. Submissions in response to requirements under this paragraphmust be accompanied by a statement that the submission includes no newmatter. This statement must be a verified statement if made by a personnot registered to practice before the PTO. Again, such a statement maybe made by the applicant. Extensions of time in which to reply to a requirementunder this paragraph are available pursuant to 37 CFR 1.136. When an actionby the applicant is a bona fide attempt to comply with these rules, atthe time of filing or later or in response to a notice to comply, and itis apparent that compliance with some requirement has inadvertently beenomitted, the opportunity to explain and supply the omission may be givenbefore the question of abandonment is considered.Section 1.821(h), if added as proposed, would require compliance with therequirements of paragraphs (b) through (f), as discussed above, withinone month from the date of a notice requiring compliance in an internationalapplication filed in the United States Receiving Office under the PatentCooperation Treaty (PCT), if the above noted requirements are not satisfiedat the time of filing. A search report for those claims in the applicationthat are directed to nucleotide and/or amino acid sequences will not beestablished by the PTO, as an international searching authority, wherethere is a failure to comply with the above requirements. Submissions inresponse to requirements under this paragraph must be accompanied by astatement that the submission does not go beyond the disclosure in theinternational application as filed. This statement must be a verified statementif made by a person not registered to practice before the PTO. Such a statementmay be made by an applicant. Delays in meeting the time limit set forthin this rule may only be excused as provided in PCT Rule 82.Section 1.822, if added as proposed, would set forth the format and symbolsto be used for listing nucleotide and/or amino acid sequence data. Thecodes for representing the nucleotide and/or amino acid characters areset forth in the tables of paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section.For the purpose of setting forth the sequence in the ``Sequence Listing,''only those symbols in paragraph (b)(1) for ``Base codes'' and in paragraph(b)(2 for ``Amino acids'' are to be used, as further set forth in paragraphs(c) and (e) of this section. The ``Modified base controlled vocabulary''in paragraph (b)(3) and the ``Modified and unusual amino acids'' in paragraph(b)(4) are not to be used in setting forth the sequences; but they maybe used in the description and/or the ``Sequence Listing'' correspondingto, but not including, the sequence itself. For example, where an ``N''occurs in a nucleotide sequence or where an ``Xaa'' occurs in an aminoacid sequence, these variables may be described in the description and/orthe ``Sequence Listing'' as being one of the listed modified bases or oneof the listed modified or unusual amino acids, respectively.In paragraph (b) of proposed andSection; 1.822, the second sentence thereofwould require that a fixed width font be used to present sequence data.This would be required to ensure that the desired sequence character spacingand numbering be maintained upon printing.In paragraphs (b)(2) and (e) of proposed andSection; 1.822, the use of three-lettercodes for amino acids would be required. The use of the three-letter codesfor amino acids is preferred over the one-letter codes from the perspectiveof facilitating the examiner's review of the application papers, includingthe ``Sequence Listing,'' and the public's, as well as the examiner's,use of the printed patents.Paragraphs (d) through (p) andSection; 1.822 would set forth the format forpresenting sequence data. These paragraphs set forth the manner in whichthe characters in sequences are to be grouped, spaced, presented and numbered.It should be noted that paragraph (d) of this section would require thatamino acids corresponding to codons in the coding parts of a nucleotidesequence be listed above the corresponding codons. This would be requiredto eliminate potential ambiguities in those instances where both the codingand non-coding strands of a nucleotide sequence are presented. The enumerationprocedure for amino acid sequences follows this rationale in paragraph(n) of this section. Sequences that are circular in configuration are intendedto be encompassed by these rules and numbering procedures for them areprovided in paragraph (n) of this section. Sequences that are circularin configuration are intended to be encompassed by these rules and numberprocedures for them are provided in paragraph (n) of this section. Thenumbering procedures set forth in paragraphs (l) through (n) of this sectionare not necessarily intended to be consistent with all currently employednumbering procedures. The objective here is to establish a reasonable numberingprocedure that can readily be followed and adhered to in the future. Asa whole, these formatting procedures also reflect those that have beenagreed to for electronic data exchange with the JPO and the EPO.Section 1.823, if added as proposed, would set forth the informationalrequirements for inclusion in the separate part of the disclosure on papercopy that would be submitted in accordance with proposed andSection; 1.821(c).This section lists the items of information that are to be included inthe ``Sequence Listing,'' which constitutes the separate part of the disclosureon paper copy. The items of information are to be presented in the ``SequenceListing,'' immediately preceding the actual nucleotide and/or amino acidsequence, in the order in which those items are listed in this section.The heading for each item of information shall not include the parentheticalexplanatory information included in this section.In proposed andSection; 1.823, the items of information are broken down intotwo categories. The first category is directed to ``GENERAL INFORMATION''and includes information relating to the application being filed, the diskette/tapebeing submitted and publication information. It is likely that this informationwill be applicable for all sequences and, as such, will need to be setforth only once in a given ``Sequence Listing.'' The second category isdirected to ``INFORMATION FOR SEQ ID NO:X'' and includes information that,most likely, will be specific for each sequence disclosed. Where more thanone sequence is disclosed this category will repeat and subsequent headingsshould be set forth as: ``(3) INFORMATION FOR SEQ ID NO:2:,'' ``(4) INFORMATIONFOR SEQ ID NO:3:,'' etc. Throughout the above two categories, the itemsof information are further broken down into categories relating to whethertheir submission is mandatory (M), recommended (R) or optional (O). Certainitems are also designated as those that may repeat (rep) in a given ``SequenceListing.'' The first category includes those items for which inclusionin the ``Sequence Listing'' is mandatory. These mandatory items of informationrelate to the patent application, the computer readable form, basic sequencedata and the applicable priority or PCT data. The reference in paragraph(B)(1)(v)(C) of proposed andSection; 1.823 to ``F-terms'' relates to thekey-word indexing of patents that is being undertaken by the JPO in conjunctionwith their automation plans. The second category includes those items forwhich inclusion in the ``Sequence Listing'' is recommended, but not required.These recommended items of information provide further information relatingto the sequence listed. These additional items of information are of interestto examiners and will create a more comprehensive database and, as a result,would serve to facilitate sequence searching. The third category includesitems of information that are primarily for the purpose of providing morecomplete information upon dissemination, for which inclusion in the ``SequenceListing'' is also optional.A sample ``Sequence Listing'' is included as Appendix I, following thisnotice. As indicated in the sample ``Sequence Listing,'' only informationthat is applicable to a given sequence need be listed in the ``SequenceListing.'' The sample ``Sequence Listing'' also serves to illustrate thatwhen the coding parts of a nucleotide sequence and their correspondingamino acids have been identified, if applicant desires to discuss thoseamino acids in the coding parts of the nucleotide as a separate sequence,those amino acids must also be set forth as a separate sequence. This willminimize ambiguities that may result in those instances where the aminoacids corresponding to the coding parts of a nucleotide sequence constitutetwo separate amino acid sequences. Further, in those instances when applicantdesires to discuss, as separate sequences, all three phases of the codingparts of a nucleotide sequence, six separate sequences should be set forthin the ``Sequence Listing'' to minimize confusion. These six sequenceswould include three nucleotide sequences separately showing the three phasesof the coding parts of the sequence and three separate amino acid sequencescorresponding to the coding parts of the three phases of the nucleotidesequence. A complete listing of abbreviated headings for all items of informationis provided in Appendix II, also following this notice. For purposes ofclarity, when a nucleotide sequence is being described, the appropriateresponses for ``(ii) KIND'' are also set forth in Appendix II, but onlythose that are applicable should be included in a given ``Sequence Listing.''After the heading for each item in the ``Sequence Listing,'' the appropriateinformation or a yes/no answer should be provided. Where SEQ ID NO: X appears,the appropriate sequence identification number should be provided.In paragraph (b)(1)(i) of proposed andSection; 1.823, the item of informationrelating to ``APPLICANT'' should be limited to a maximum of the first tennamed applicants in the application.In paragraph (b)(2)(vii) of proposed andSection; 1.823, relating to ``FEATURES''or the description of the points of biological significance in a givensequence, it is recommended, but not required, that the information thatis provided by the applicant conform to the controlled vocabulary thatis set forth in GenBank's ``Feature Representation in Nucleotide SequenceData Libraries,'' Release 57.0, as may be amended.Section 1.824, if added as proposed, would set forth the form for sequencesubmissions in computer readable form. Currently, the computer readableform is being limited to diskettes or tapes. However, as noted above, itis contemplated that this may be broadened in the future in light of progressin the technology for developing and establishing databases of this type.The manner in which the sequence information is encoded on the computerreadable form and the computer/operating-system configurations on whichthe computer readable form must be readable are also set forth. The proposedrule indicates that currently acceptable computer/operating-system configurationsinclude IBM, Macintosh and UNIX. Again, it is possible that this may bebroadened in the future to encompass other computer/operating-system configurations.If a given sequence and its associated information cannot practically orpossibly fit on a single diskette or tape, as would be required in paragraph(d) of this section, an exception via a non-fee petition to waive thisprovision will normally be granted. As set forth in paragaph (g) of proposedandSection; 1.824, the computer readable forms that are submitted in accordancewith these rules will not be returned to the applicant. Paragraph (h) ofproposed andSection; 1.824 requires the labeling, with appropriate identifyinginformation, of the computer readable forms that are submitted in accordancewith these rules.Section 1.825, if added as proposed, would set forth the procedures foramending the ``Sequence Listing'' and the computer readable copy thereof.The procedures that have been defined in this section involve the submissionof either substitute sheets of the ``Sequence Listing'' or substitute copiesof the computer readable form, in conjunction with statements that indicatesupport for the amendment in the application, as filed, and that the substitutesheets or copies include no new matter. The requirement for statementsregarding the absence of new matter follows current practice relating tothe submission of substitute specifications, as set forth in 37 CFR 1.125.Paragraph (c) of proposed andSection; 1.825 explicitly addresses the situationwhere amendments to the ``Sequence Listing'' are made after a patent hasbeen granted, e.g., by a certificate of correction, reissue or reexamination.Paragraph (d) of proposed andSection; 1.825 addresses the possibility andpresents a remedy for the situation where the computer readable form maybe found by the PTO to be damaged or unreadable.<ITAG tagnum="84">Other Considerations</ITAG>The proposed rule change is in conformity with the requirements of theRegulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354), Executive Orders 12291 and12612, and the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce certified to the ChiefCounsel for Advocacy, Small Business Administration that the proposed rulechange will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of smallentities (Regulatory Flexibility Act, Pub. L. 96-354) due to the limitednumber of entities, both small and otherwise, that are involved in therelevant technology. Further, the costs associated with the proposed rulechange would not have a significant impact on overall costs associatedwith filing patent applications because the proposed rule change adoptsstandards, procedures, and formats which are becoming industry and internationalnorms.The Patent and Trademark Office has determined that this proposed rulechange is not a major rule under Executive Order 12291. The annual effecton the economy will be less than $100 million. There will be no major increasein costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, federal, stateor local government agencies, or geographic regions. There will be no significantadverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation,or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-basedenterprises in domestic or export markets.The Patent and Trademark Office has also determined that this notice hasno Federalism implications affecting the relationship between the NationalGovernment and the States as outlined in Executive Order 12612.The proposed rule contains a collection of information subject to the PaperworkReduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3> Collections of information relating to patent applicationshave previously been approved by the Office of Management and Budget undercode 0651-0011. For the great majority of applications that will be filedhaving nucleotide and amino acid sequences falling within the limits definedherein, applicants will not have to expend any substantial extra time tocomply with these rules over and above that previously approved for patentapplications. For the most part and as noted above with regard to currentpractice in the industry, the required information will have already beenkeyed into a computer system. As such, compliance with these rules willinvolve only the additional submission of relevant application and computerreadable form information and a minor, one-time, revision of the formatfor presenting sequence data, after which, no additional expenditure oftime for format compliance will be necessary. Any burden that may be attributedto the submission of relevant application and computer readable form informationmay, in fact, be more than offset by the fact that compliance with theserules will have the substantial benefit of reducing the overall time necessaryto prepare applications because a given sequence will only have to be setforth once in an application and further references thereto will be madeby means of a sequence identifier. Accordingly, compliance with these rulesis estimated to take approximately fifteen additional minutes, includingtime for reviewing instructions, maintaining data needed and completingand reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding thisburden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information,including suggestions for reducing this burden to the Office of Managementand Organization, Patent and Trademark Office, Washington, DC 20231; andto the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Managementand Budget, Washington, DC 20503, Attention: Paperwork Reduction Project0651-XXXX.<ITAG tagnum="84">Lists of Subjects in 37 CFR Part 1</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Courts, Freedom of information,Inventions and patents, Reporting and record-keeping requirements, Smallbusinesses.For the reasons set out in the preamble and under the authority grantedto the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks by 35 U.S.C. 6, the Patentand Trademark Office is proposed to amend Title 37 of the Code of FederalRegulations as set forth below.<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 1_RULES OF PRACTICE IN PATENT CASES</ITAG>1.
