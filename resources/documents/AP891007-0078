Baker III forthree-way talks involving Israel, Egypt and the United States totry to break the deadlock in the Middle East peace process.   Leaders of Israel's two major parties said they were encouragedby the offer, but it was likely to face strong opposition fromhard-liners in Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing Likudbloc.   On Friday, Israel's policy-making inner Cabinet voted to rejectan Egyptian proposal for talks in Cairo on elections in theoccupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.   The center-left Labor Party, the junior partner in the coalitiongovernment, supported Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's plan. Butthe Likud opposed it and the Cabinet deadlocked 6-6. That meant theproposal was rejected.   In Washington, U.S. officials said Baker was trying to keep theEgyptian proposal alive. They said that after the Israeli Cabinetvote, Baker spoke by telephone with Israeli Foreign Minister MosheArens and Egyptian Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid.   Arens said Baker proposed that Israel, Egypt and the UnitedStates meet for consultations on the formation of a Palestiniandelegation for peace talks.   ``This offer does not contain the dangers in the proposal''rejected Friday, Arens told Israel radio.   Arens, a senior Likud official, said the difference between theBaker and the Mubarak proposals was whether Israel is to ``meetwith a PLO delegation or a delegation of Palestinians set up withour agreement.''   Likud objects to the participation of Palestinians from outsidethe occupied territories, but the Palestinians have demanded this.   As a compromise, Mubarak has proposed that Palestinians who havebeen deported from the territories participate. Likud rejects this,seeing it as a backdoor opening to the PLO. Israel officially viewsthe PLO as a terror group and refuses to deal with it.   Arens said Baker first made his offer in a telephoneconversation last week, and he asked Baker Thursday to formallysubmit the proposal to Israel. He said the offer could be discussedin the government's next meeting.   Labor Party leader Shimon Peres said he did ``not see any realdifferences between the Baker offer and the Mubarak proposal.''   In Cairo, Abdel-Meguid said that ``consultations are under waywith the United States and Israel.'' He did not elaborate.   Hard-liners in the Likud have said they will oppose the Bakeroffer as staunchly as they fought Mubarak's proposal.   ``There are not going to be any more concessions on the Israeliside,'' Trade Minister Ariel Sharon said following the Cabinet vote.   Some Labor officials are urging their party to quit thecoalition government over the peace stalemate.   Peres said Saturday his party would consider withdrawing ifthere is no progress toward peace.   ``What is clear is that this situation cannot continue,'' Peressaid. ``There are a number of possible actions we can take and wewill examine them.''   The Israeli peace initiative, which the government endorsed inMay, calls for the election of Palestinians to negotiate an interimautonomy agreement with Israel. The final status of the occupiedlands would be determined later.   Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan and the Gaza Stripfrom Egypt during the 1967 Middle East war. Palestinians living inthe occupied territories have been waging an uprising againstIsraeli rule since December 1987 and are pursuing their longtimegoal of creating an independent state.   Since the uprising began, 585 Palestinians have been killed byIsraeli troops or civilians. Another 127 Palestinians have beenkilled by fellow Arabs, most on suspicion of collaborating withIsrael. Forty Israelis have died.</TEXT></DOC>
