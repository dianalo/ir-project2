McELROY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Eli Wallach has deemed Barbra Streisand nuts.   Not exactly. But as Dr. Herbert A. Morrison in the movie,``Nuts,'' Wallach portrays a psychiatrist who is truly convincedthat Claudia Draper, a former call girl accused of murder, isinsane and therefore must be locked away. Streisand, as Draper,believes otherwise.   ``As a heavy I am not well liked in the movie,'' Wallach said.``But I approached the character with the conviction that he is aprofessional and he made this diagnosis based on years ofexperience. The more this girl rants and raves, the more I amconvinced of my diagnosis.''   The consummate professional, Wallach has brought to the screenmore than 40 years of acting experience.   ``You know, originally I prepared for a teaching career, but dueto several circumstances I missed the exam,'' he said. ``So Idecided to do what I most wanted to do and that was to act.''   He began his career with a scholarship to the NeighborhoodPlayhouse in New York and made his first appearance in the EquityLibrary production of Tennessee Williams' ``This Property IsCondemned.''   This became an important turning point in Wallach's life, forthe only other performer in the show happened to be the actress,Anne Jackson, who later became his wife.   Wallach made his Broadway debut in 1945 in ``Skydrift'' ashort-lived production. But soon thereafter, he was cast in theBroadway production of ``Mister Roberts,'' which starred HenryFonda and ran for two years.   He then went on to receive a Tony award for Tennesse Williams'``The Rose Tattoo.''   ``It's a shame that shows have become so expensive here in NewYork, because we would have less problems if everybody were able togo to the theater _ rich, poor, black, white, minorities _everbody,'' he said.   ``Theater is not a luxury but a necessity, for theater helpspeople understand the human condition.''   This belief in the power of theater to reach out to people hasled Wallach through many plays in his long career, including``Camino Real,'' ``Henry VIII,'' ``Antony and Cleopatra,'' ``Waltzof the Toreadors,'' ``Luv'' and ``The Teahouse of the August Moon.''   Wallach's movie career began with Elia Kazan's debut as adirector in ``Baby Doll'' in 1956, for which he won Britain'shighest film acting honor.   ``I used to sneer at the screen,'' Wallach said, ``then Irealized how hard it is.   ``A movie has many layers _ the director wheels the baton and Iplay the instrument. Although it's a lot of hard work, I have funand that's important.   ``Let me tell you this,'' he continued. ``The most importantthings in life are the right partner and your work. If you find alifelong partner and you love your work, you are a most fortunateperson.''   The 72-year-old Wallach has indeed been fortunate. He andJackson have raised two daughters and a son. He has also appearedin aproximately 50 motion pictures since ``Baby Doll.'' He is mostrecognized for his role in the spaghetti Western, ``The Good, theBad and the Ugly.''   ``People all over the world still come up to me on the streetsand mention that movie with Clint Eastwood,'' he said.   His other films include ``The Magnificent Seven,'' ``TheMisfits,'' ``How the West Was Won,'' ``Cinderella Liberty,'' ``TheDeep'' and ``Tough Guys.''   His most recent TV appearances include ``The Executioner'sSong'' and an HBO movie, ``The Impossible Spy.''   Even though he's busy with films and television _ he's also thesponsor for Toyota Trucks _ he still manages to keep one foot inthe theater.   ``I am like a farmer who rotates his crops, I always allocate acertain period of my time to go back to my roots _ the theater.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv</NOTE></DOC>
