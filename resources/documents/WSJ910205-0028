The SEC said that Edward Ruggiero, Vista's supervisor ofinternal audit, and his friend Christopher Parker nettedabout $877,000 in illegal profits by buying Vista options andcommon stock before the $590 million deal was announced withthe unit of RWE AG, a German industrial concern.</LP><TEXT>   The two men haven't settled the agency's charges, and theSEC is seeking a temporary restraining order and a freeze ontheir assets. The SEC is suing for three times the allegedillegal gains as a civil penalty as well as a return of thealleged profits.   The agency also said its investigation of the case iscontinuing, a signal that more cases may be brought.   Mr. Ruggiero used his position at Houston-based Vista toobtain material nonpublic information about the merger plans,the agency said. In addition to having conversations withVista executives, the SEC charged, he gathered insight intothe pending deal by reading the expense reports of Vistasenior officers that reflected travel and other expensesincurred during the negotiations. The agency said thedocuments included expense accounting for such purposes as&quot;meeting . . . to discuss change of control documents&quot; and&quot;meeting with Morgan Stanley,&quot; Vista's investment banker.   Mr. Ruggiero then bought 440 &quot;deep out-of-the-money&quot;options contracts, a bet that the stock price (and thecorresponding option) would skyrocket, according to the SEC.He sold those contracts on the day of the acquisitionannouncement for a profit of $673,250, the commission added.   Mr. Parker was tipped to the pending agreement by Mr.Ruggiero, the SEC said. Although he knew the information wasa breach of fiduciary duty, the SEC said, Mr. Parker bought115 similar out-of-the-money option contracts and 100 sharesof Vista common. He sold those securities on the day of theannouncement for a profit of $203,556, the agency said.   A Vista spokeswoman said Mr. Ruggiero is still employed atthe company as the internal auditing supervisor. &quot;There areno immediate plans to change that status,&quot; she said.&quot;However, the company will be evaluating the situation asthis progresses.&quot; She added that the company has &quot;cooperatedfully with the SEC since the investigation began.&quot;   The Vista spokeswoman also said that Mr. Ruggiero is outof the office this week and she didn't know how he could becontacted. Mr. Parker, who the spokeswoman said was not knownto the company, nor in anyway affliated with it, couldn't bereached for comment.</TEXT></DOC>
