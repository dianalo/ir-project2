The 27th Army sickened the citizens of Beijing with its bloodysuppression of a pro-democracy movement. The weekend attack lefthundreds and perhaps thousands of people dead in the city center.   Other units of the People's Liberation Army soon entered thecapital to the cheers of the people, who believed the new soldiershad orders to crush the hated 27th, which had remained lodged inTiananmen Square.   A military confrontation seemed imminent earlier this week withscattered reports of soldiers fighting soldiers inside Beijing andartillery fire.   Different units were said to be loyal to rival politicians, withthe 27th supporting hard-line President Yang Shangkun and othersfavoring moderate leaders who opposed the crackdown.   In addition, the 27th Army's withering gunfire and tank advancenot only killed civilians but also took its toll on soldiers fromother military units that got in the way, according to a Westerndiplomat.   But the recent arrivals have not taken up positions of battle.Instead, they have brandished brooms to sweep the streets clean.They have chatted amiably with curious citizens.   The new forces were deployed to win propaganda points for thePeople's Liberation Army by providing ``an acceptable face'' toBeijing citizens, not to fight their fellow soldiers, one Westerndiplomat said.   The introduction of ``friendly'' troops clearly has helped pacifythe Beijing residents, who no longer are gathering in the streets inlarge numbers to protest the weekend massacre.   The likelihood that some or all of the 27th Army have leftTiananmen Square without battling other troops also suggests unitsare not about to fight each other.   Tanks of the 27th Army that took up positions on strategicbridges leading downtown were formed not to defend against a rivalmilitary force but to deter a ``people power'' uprising, thediplomat said.   ``One would like to think they were factionalized ... but thereis no evidence,'' he said.   Other experts doubt that differences within the military over theimposition of martial law on Beijing to end the pro-democracymovement and the use of force against unarmed citizens will lead tomajor factional fighting.   ``Probably, a majority of the army sympathizes with the students,but they won't shoot each other over it,'' said Harvey Jencks, aresearch associate at the University of California at Berkeley whois an expert on the Chinese military.   ``The army has always opted for unity,'' Jencks said. ``Theinstinct of most Chinese soldiers is to unite behind bad policyinstead of breaking up.''   The latest government policy is an intensified crackdown againstthe pro-democracy activists. New martial law edicts issued Thursdayorder movement leaders to give themselves up and urged residents toturn in fellow citizens who took party in ``hooliganism anddestruction.''   It is not yet clear to what degree the army will help enforcethose martial law orders.</TEXT></DOC>
