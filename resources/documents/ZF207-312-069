(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Hewlett-Packard: No More Mr. Nice GuyandM;Hewlett-Packard is continuing an aggressive international effort aimed atwinning over DEC and IBM buyers.andM;The $10 billion conglomerate, headquartered in Palo Alto, Calif., in the pastyear has moved away from its beginnings as a vendor of instrumentation andproprietary technical networks and systems in hopes of becoming a majorprovider of standards-based multivendor networking products.andM;Aggressive workstation price cuts, three new workstations and theintroduction earlier this month of HP's so-called DEC Migration Program werethe latest in a long series of moves under the direction of HP Chairman JohnYoung toward becoming a general-purpose computer vendor to beat DEC.andP;  (See&quot;HP to Tempt DEC Customers with Painless Migration Plan,&quot; Digital Review,Jan. 9, page 3.)andM;Reel Them InandM;Hewlett-Packard is trying to lure general-purpose computer buyers with, amongother things, new Series 3000 midrange systems and the new PrecisionArchitecture, the New ave graphics interface, Advancenet networking softwareand highly competitive RISC-based Unix workstations.andM;In recent months, there has also been from Hewlett-Packard the emergence of anew maintenance business and revitalized terminals business, an aggressiveEuropean trade-in program, several new partnerships, and reorganized domesticcomputer operations.andP;  (See &quot;Significant Announcements from Hewlett-Packard,&quot;page 47.)andM;Coupled with its traditionally strong price/performance, reputation forquality and top-notch service, Hewlett-Packard is becoming increasinglyattractive to DEC buyers, according to industry watchers.andM;&quot;HP has slowed down the onslaught from Digital and could completely disruptDEC's customer base,&quot; said John Logan, vice president of the Aberdeen Group,a market research company based in Boston.andM;In a keynote address at Hewlett-Packard's 1988 annual user group conferenceheld in England, Bill Murphy, HP's business systems marketing director,summarized the hungry new HP.andP;  &quot;No more Mr. Nice Guy to our competitors, butno change for our customers,&quot; he told the attendees.andM;There are indications that the strategy is succeeding.andP;  Hewlett-Packardreported a record $10 billion in new orders in fiscal 1988, a 20 percentincrease over the previous year.andM;Analysts say, however, that HP still faces some serious challenges, includingapplications software shortages -- especially for New-Wave applications,transaction processing and relational database management systems (RDBMSes)on the HP 3000 Series 900 -- and a lack of interest in HP 1000 real-timeprocessors and the proprietary MPE operating system.andM;Hewlett-Packard's increased activity has led to a feistier marketing rivalrywith DEC.andP;  Both companies are scoffing at each other's performance claimsalmost as loudly as they tout their own products.andM;&quot;We see more of Hewlett-Packard in full-page ads in The Wall Street Journalthan we do in actual competitive situations in the market,&quot; said RebeccaBailin, DEC's competitive analysis manager.andM;&quot;The only time we see Hewlett-Packard [in the market] is when HP 3000 usersare considering moving to DEC,&quot; Bailin added.andM;Dave Hoover, Hewlett-Packard's product marketing manager for MPE systems,countered: &quot;DEC has been making a big deal of its on-line transactionprocessing abilities.andP;  But the 3000 has really been optimized forprice/performance in on-line transaction processing.andM;&quot;We feel as though we're very competitive with Digital Equipment acrossproduct lines,&quot;  Hoover said.andP;  &quot;We pretty much match up against the entirerange of DEC processors.&quot;andM;DEC's Bailin, however, said the VAX 6200's &quot;performance is just about thesame as HP's.&quot;andP;  She added that MPE's unpopularity as an operating systemnegates any price/performance advantage claimed by HP.andP;  &quot;HP is sufferingunder a much bigger disadvantage in the marketplace,&quot; Balin said.andM;Bailin also charged that HP's DBMS for on-line transaction processing was outof sync with market preferences.andM;Despite the rhetoric, DEC has been taking HP seriously.andP;  In response to HP'saggressive European trade-in program for VAXes and PDPs, DEC formed theEuropean Competitive Analysis Team.andP;  Based in Evry, France, the DEC team hasbeen assigned to provide strategic analysis and help the sales force win newaccounts.andM;Buyers sometimes report amusing consequences of the companies' rivalry.andM;One buyer, Ken Facer, executive vice president of the San Bernardino CountyCredit Union in San Bernardino, Calif., recalled that, when he was in themarket for a new system, sales and technical people from Hewlett-Packardwould arrive an masse, set up presentations and prove conclusively they hadthe better mousetrap.andM;The next day DEC salespeople and technicians would arrive with the same show.andO;&quot;They both just couldn't understand how, after their demonstration, we wouldeven look at the other vendor,&quot; Facer said.andM;DEC AppealandM;Even though Hewlett-Packard is coming on like gangbusters, products from DEC,a proven full-range supplier, continue to appeal to many MIS managers,analysts said.andM;&quot;Right now, you have at HP a very fine promise in the form of their PrecisionArchitecture at the high end of the Unix and MPE business lines,&quot; theAberdeen Group's Logan said.andM;&quot;But -- unfortunately for Hewlett-Packard -- as an MIS manager looking for abusiness solution, there is not yet a line of low-end products compatiblewith Precision Architecture at the high end,&quot; he said.andM;Nonetheless, he noted, &quot;enterprising MIS managers are acquiring very largequantities of HP Precision Architecture products for specialized applicationswhere they fit and where they can do the job today.&quot;andM;According to Peter Rogers, computer analyst with the san Francisco-basedconsulting company Robertson, Colman andamp; Stephens, DEC is more competitive thanHewlett-Packard in departmental processing, networking and applicationssupport.andM;&quot;VAX architecture is everywhere,&quot; Rogers said.andP;  But he noted that &quot;HP has afar more competitive product line than it used to,&quot; and in some areasHewlett-Packard is ahead of DEC.andM;HP's ability to tie together its proprietary MPE operating system with MS-DOSand Unix is generally regarded as superior to DEC's current tie-in betweenVMS and Unix or IBM's intergration capabilities.andM;&quot;HP has a slight advantage with shop floor computers, business computers anddesign automation computers,&quot; Rogers said, &quot;while DEC has a definite advangein commercial applications.&quot;andM;DEC holds the lead in office automation, he added, but &quot;the good news at HPis they're doing a much better job than DEC or IBM in workstations,peripherals and personal computers.andP;  They are also doing better than DEC orIBM in Unix support,&quot; he said.andM;Users, software developers and analysts generally agree that most buyerstoday would choose DEC over HP because of its more standard operating systemand range of applications.andM;However, analysts contend, if HP can flesh out its applications offerings anddevelop good networking links, HP will win new DEC buyers as the nextgeneration of computing comes of age.andM;A strong area of HP is price/performance.andP;  Now that Precision Architecture isfinally being shipped, most analysts agree that HP's hardwareprice/performance surpasses DEC's by anywhere from 40 percent to 300 percent.andM;&quot;You have a very small, one-board system going up against VAXes that are alot more complicated and have a lot more boards in them,&quot; said Greg Marus,industry analyst at Dataquest, a San Jose, Calif.-based market researchcompany.andM;&quot;It's a very elegant design, and there is less in there to break down,&quot; Marusadded.andM;&quot;As an MIS manager, I would certainly want to look at a small, powerfulmachine that is inherently reliable and has great service if the thing goesdown,&quot; Marus said.andM;&quot;Price/performance is really a very small element,&quot; Rogers of Robertson,Colman andamp; Stephens said.andP;  &quot;Rarely can a competitive loss be contributed toprice/performance.andP;  Just look at Data General.andP;  They have much betterprice/performance than DEC, but DEC has better integrated architecture, amore effective marketing and sales organization, and applications support,&quot;he added.andM;Aberdeen Group's Logan said, &quot;The price/performance claims HP is making areabsolutely right.andP;  They've got the hot box capability.andP;  But thedisappointment is they need communications, user interfaces, officeautomation and other things one expects from a full-range supplier.andP;  Therethey are still knocked by DEC and IBM.&quot;andM;Analysts say Hewlett-Packard is still about three behind DEC on applicationssupport capabilities and lags even further behind DEC on its networking andintegration capabilities.andM;Sean Bandarkar, HP product line manager at Oracle in Belmont, Calif., notedthat HP traditionally has not focused on foundation software such asdatabases and engineering tools.andM;&quot;But in the last year or two, they are focusing more on that and working withOracle to build a strong offering on the 3000 line,&quot; Bandarkar said.andM;&quot;Within a one-year time frame, Oracle will flesh out the product set for HP3000.andP;  Right now, the VAX has a more full line,&quot; he said.andM;Net DifferenceandM;Unlike HP, DEC offers tight integration--the ability to cluster VAXes--to runthe same applications software on any of its machines and to network intoother areas of a shop.andM;On the other hand, analysts noted that Hewlett-Packard lacks a similar way tolink its equipment and does not offer anything comparable to DECnet orEthernet for networking.andM;Nevertheless, HP is keeping pace with DEC in providing operating environmentlinking capabilities.andM;&quot;Both companies are making an effort to combine all operatingenvironments--proprietary MS-DOS and Unix,&quot; said John Dean, an analyst forMontgomery Securities, an investment house in San Francisco.andM;In the long term, DEC is seen as holding the huge advantage of having its VMSoperating system as a proprietary standard.andP;  Analysts say the market cannotabsorb a fourth standard--MS-DOS, VMS and Unix are more than enough.andM;Thus, analysts say the future of MPE--which runs on about 75 percent of HPsystems--is uncertain.andM;HP has optimistically countered by saying that the September release of anMPE upgrade--the MPE XL 1.1--has boosted performance 30 percent, tripledreliability and won customer plaudits.andM;Analysts say they believe MPE cannot survive in the long run but note thatits life could be prolonged if it can be linked to other environments.andM;Unix could help even things out.andP;  Most analysts agreed that HP is ahead ofDEC in Unix development.andM;For example, HP has positioned its HP 3000 MPE systems forperformance-oriented users and its HP 9000 and Motorola 68000 Unix machinesfor those requiring industry-standard operations.andM;If Hewlett-Packard falls short on its operating system, it has a leg up onits rivals with highly competitive desktop and workstation offerings.andM;HP is aggressively competing in the workstation area.andP;  Analysts point to HP'slead over both IBM and DEC in workstations, which many believe will replaceminis in the 1990s.andM;According to Robertson, Colman's Rogers, &quot;All three of them [HP, DEC andIBM]--unless they really blow it--have a shot at having very meaningfulpositions in workstations,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;It's hard to call, but I tend to thinkHP has got a significant edge.&quot;andM;Montgomery Securities' Dean agreed with that assessment.andP;  &quot;Today, HP has amuch broader range of workstations, plus their high-end PCs, the Motorolamachines,&quot; he said.andM;Position PointsandM;To bolster its already strong position in the desktop arena, HP announced onJan. 9 new products and aggressive price cuts on 6-month-old workstations.andO;These moves were aimed squarely at DEC's recent desktop blitz, analysts said.andM;The company announced a low-end, Motorola 68030-based three-dimensionalgraphics workstation priced at $14,900.andP;  Also introduced were two newhigh-end 80386 additions, the RS/20 and RS/25, as part of the Vectra line ofdesktop personal computers.andM;Prices on the midrange Model 360SRX were chopped 42 percent to $19,900, andprices on the high-end Model 370SRX were reduced 17 percent to $41,000.andP;  TheModel 825SRX, based on HP's Precision Architecture RISC chip, was reducedfrom $59,000 to $56,250.andM;HP's Motorola 68000 CPU-based line is rated at approximately 4 or 5 MIPS vs.andO;the Micro VAX's 1 to 2 MIPS.andP;  At the high end, Precision Architectureworkstations running Unix are well ahead of DEC and IBM offerings.andM;Also, HP offers a product with three-dimensional graphics capabilities forautomobile design and packaging, among other things.andP;  DEC, on the other hand,does not offer similar three-dimensional capabilities on the Micro VAX 3.andM;&quot;In graphics, it's HP hands down&quot; Dean said.andM;Although DEC currently holds a firm lead, analysts say that, within a coupleof years, HP not only could pose a real challenge to the No.andP;  2 vendor, butcould move into IBM's markets as well.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
