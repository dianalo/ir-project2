The long pulselength and high power levels of Tore Supra, coupled with the desire toremove the maximum practical number of particles, have driven the pumplimiter design beyond that ever before experienced. The engineering considerationsgoing into this design are reviewed and several preliminary designs arediscussed.</TEXT></DOC>
