Currently, a major problem in user-interface design anddevelopment is that this iterative-design approach is very expensive.As an attempt to solve this problem, many User Interface Management Systems(UIMSs) have been proposed. These are software systems specifically designedfor rapid prototyping of user interfaces. Unfortunately, most of theseare too restricted. In particular, no UIMS that has been reported inthe literature is designed to support interfaces where the user is freeto use both hands concurrently, for example, positioning an object withone hand while selecting a color for it with the other. Also, most areseverely restricted by a lack of support for communication among variouscomponents of the interactive system at run-time. This thesis makes twomajor contributions that address these problems: (1) a new language forspecifying the syntax of human-computer dialogue languages, and (2) anew way of supporting communication among the run-time components ofa user interface.</TEXT></DOC>
